Variations in anatomy of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel: pitfalls in the diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Two processes account for most instances of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow: compression in the retroepicondylar groove, and compression by the humeroulnar aponeurotic arcade joining the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. While conventional electrodiagnostic criteria may localize an ulnar neuropathy to the elbow, separating retroepicondylar compression from humeroulnar arcade compression is more difficult. In 130 cadaver elbows, we examined the relationships between the medial epicondyle, flexor carpi ulnaris, and ulnar nerve. The humeroulnar arcade lay from 3 to 20 mm distal to the medial epicondyle, the intramuscular course of the nerve through the flexor carpi ulnaris ranged from 18 to 70 mm, and the nerve exited the flexor carpi ulnaris 28 to 69 mm distal to the medial epicondyle. In 6 specimens, dense fibrous bands bridged directly between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon proximal to the cubital tunnel proper; accessory epitrochleoanconeus muscles were present in 14 specimens: both may cause ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Anatomical variations may contribute to the difficulty in separating causes of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. 
Colonic hyperproliferation induced in rats and mice by nutritional-stress diets containing four components of a human Western-style diet (series 2). In a previous study colonic hyperplasia and hyperproliferation were induced in mice and rats by a nutritional-stress diet, based on the AIN-76A semisynthetic diet modified to contain four suggested high-risk components of the human Western-style diet: increased fat and phosphate and decreased calcium and vitamin D contents. In this study the effect of raising calcium alone to near the median level (0.22 mg/kcal) and to a high level (1.3 mg/kcal), comparable to adult human dietary intake, was tested in mice and rats while retaining the three other high-risk components. With median calcium intake the nutritional-stress diet induced hyperproliferation of epithelial cells in colonic crypts, with increased numbers of proliferating cells in crypt columns in sigmoid colon of mice (P less than 0.001) and rats (P = 0.02) and in the ascending colon of mice (P = 0.01). With high calcium intake, hyperproliferation was reduced almost to control amounts in the presence of unchanged fat, phosphate, and vitamin D. 
Human articular cartilage and chondrocytes produce hemopoietic colony-stimulating factors in culture in response to IL-1. The hemopoietic CSF, granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), are cytokines that mediate the clonal proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells into mature macrophages and/or granulocytes. We have employed an all-human cell culture system, specific ELISA for GM-CSF and G-CSF, and Northern analysis to investigate whether chondrocytes are a potential source of CSF in rheumatoid disease. We report that human rIL-1 stimulated in a dose-dependent manner the production of GM-CSF and G-CSF by human articular cartilage and chondrocyte monolayers in organ and cell culture, respectively. Increased levels of the CSF Ag were detected after 2 to 8 h stimulation with IL-1, and the optimum dose of IL-1 was 10 to 100 U/ml (0.06 to 0.6 nM IL-1 alpha; 0.02 to 0.2 nM IL-1 beta); neither CSF was detectable in nonstimulated cultures nor in IL-1-stimulated cultures treated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, indicating the requirement for de novo RNA and protein synthesis. The IL-1-mediated increase in GM-CSF could also be inhibited by the corticosteroid, dexamethasone, but not by the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin. Although having little effect when tested alone, TNF-alpha and lymphotoxin (TNF-beta) could synergize with IL-1 for the production of GM-CSF. Basic fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma each had no effect on GM-CSF levels. Results obtained by Northern analysis of chondrocyte total RNA reflected those found for the CSF Ag, namely that CSF mRNA levels were elevated in response to IL-1, but not TNF, and that there was synergy between these two cytokines. We propose that chondrocyte CSF production in response to IL-1, and the concurrent destruction of cartilage by IL-1, could provide a mechanism for the chronic nature of rheumatoid disease. 
Heterogeneous interference of nicardipine, verapamil, and diltiazem with forearm arteriolar responsiveness to adrenergic stimulation in hypertensive patients. The interference of intraarterial nicardipine, verapamil, and diltiazem with the forearm vascular response to graded exogenous norepinephrine was evaluated in hypertensive patients. Nicardipine antagonized the vasoconstrictor effect of norepinephrine in a dose-dependent manner, whereas verapamil was ineffective, suggesting that functional alpha-adrenergic antagonism may participate in the vasodilatory and possibly the antihypertensive effect. Nicardipine also blunted the vasoconstriction to lower-body negative pressure and the action of angiotensin II administered intraarterially. Despite a comparable increase in basal forearm flow, verapamil was less potent than nicardipine in inhibiting vasoconstriction after both stimuli. Therefore nicardipine suppressed preferentially regional vascular reactivity, probably by blockade of the influx of extracellular calcium in response to receptor activation, because both alpha-adrenergic and angiotensin II receptor-mediated vasoconstrictor responses were attenuated. At variance with both nicardipine and verapamil was potentiation of the responses to norepinephrine after the administration of diltiazem. Because intraarterial propranolol abolished that potentiating action and the local vasodilatation to isoproterenol was clearly reduced, diltiazem probably interfered also with beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasorelaxing mechanisms in human forearm arterioles. The data further stress the heterogeneity of calcium channel blockers in humans. 
Gastrocolic fistula with pyloric stenosis and benign gastric ulcer. We have reported a case of gastrocolic fistula with gastric outlet obstruction as a complication of benign gastric ulcer. The single-stage surgical procedure described resulted in a successful outcome. Benign gastric ulcer currently appears to be the most prevalent cause of gastrocolic fistula. 
Giant adult malignant sacrococcygeal teratoma. Successful treatment by combined abdominosacral resection. This report describes the successful removal of the largest adult sacrococcygeal teratoma (18.75 kg) the authors could find on record. The patient was 58 years of age. The tumor had been present at birth and had been biopsied at the time of her cesarean section 34 years earlier without further treatment. Special planning was necessary for moving and positioning the patient for operation to prevent injury due to the size and weight of the tumor. A combined abdominosacral resection with preliminary ligation of the internal iliac arteries and a diversionary colostomy were performed without difficulty or undue blood loss. The defect was closed primarily and drained. The tumor proved to be malignant on pathologic examination. 
Polycystic ovarian disease: contribution of vaginal endosonography and reassessment of ultrasonic diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the superiority of vaginal ultrasonography (US) on the abdominal US for the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). DESIGN: The US pattern of ovaries was prospectively investigated by abdominal US and, whenever possible, by vaginal US. SETTING: Primary care, institutional. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-four women in whom PCOD was suspected on endocrine grounds and 62 other patients presenting with primary hyperprolactinemia (n = 23) or hypothalamic anovulation (n = 39). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Vaginal US allowed a better analysis of the ovarian stroma. RESULTS: The external ovarian features of PCOD were observed by both routes in less than one third of the 144 patients with PCOD. The internal ovarian features of PCOD were much more frequently observed by vaginal US than by abdominal US (polycystic pattern: 66.7% versus 38.1%, P less than 0.05; increased ovarian stroma: 57.1% versus 4.8%, P less than 0.001). In the 62 patients without PCOD, US features of PCOD were observed in less than 10% of them, except for the uterine width/ovarian length ratio less than 1 and the polycystic pattern (abdominal US: 17% and 34%; vaginal US: 11% and 50%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: An increased ovarian stroma seems to be the most sensitive and specific US sign of PCOD, providing that it can be investigated by vaginal US. 
A randomized, controlled study of behavioral intervention for chemotherapy distress in children with cancer. Fifty-four pediatric cancer patients were studied to determine the relative efficacy of two forms of behavioral intervention for reducing chemotherapy-related distress. Following baseline assessment, subjects were randomly assigned to receive either hypnosis, non-hypnotic distraction/relaxation, or attention placebo (control) during the subsequent identical chemotherapy course. Observational and interview measures of anticipatory and postchemotherapy nausea, vomiting, distress, and functional disruption served as outcome data. Results indicated that treatment condition was the single best predictor of change from baseline to intervention, with children in the hypnosis group reporting the greatest reduction of both anticipatory and postchemotherapy symptoms. The cognitive distraction/relaxation intervention appeared to have a maintenance effect in which symptoms did not get much worse or much better, while children in the control group had symptoms that consistently became worse over time. Emetic potential of the chemotherapy and the prophylactic use of antiemetics each appeared to contribute to the overall severity of symptoms. While the efficacy of hypnosis in the management of chemotherapy distress is supported, the complexities of interacting biologic and psychologic factors are highlighted. 
The cold-knife technique for endourological management of stenoses in the upper urinary tract. Between 1985 and October 1989 we managed 13 patients with primary and 43 with secondary obstruction of the upper urinary tract with the endourological cold-knife technique. We treated 26 patients with stenosis of the ureteropelvic junction, 9 with infundibular stenosis, 12 with ureteral obstruction after inflammation or radiation therapy, 7 with stricture of the ureter in kidney transplants and 2 with stenosis of the ureter after ureterosigmoidostomy. Endourological management was successful in 42 of 56 cases with a decrease or total elimination of obstruction. Stenosis recurred in 9 patients. Our results indicate that the cold-knife technique should be attempted as the initial approach in all cases of primary or secondary obstruction of the upper urinary tract. 
Morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Three-hundred forty-one HBsAg-positive family members of 152 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (47 asymptomatic carriers, 59 with chronic hepatitis, 17 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were prospectively studied to determine the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Most of the family members had no history of acute hepatitis, were asymptomatic and were unaware of their carrier status. However, 5.3% had stigmata of chronic liver disease, 6% had serum ALT levels that exceeded two times the upper limit of normal and 78% of those who had biopsies had chronic hepatitis with or without cirrhosis. During a follow-up period of 12 to 90 mo (median = 39 mo), 3% had symptoms of chronic liver disease; 24% had transient, recurrent or persistent elevation in serum ALT levels, 1.4% had cirrhosis and 1% had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither hepatocellular carcinoma in the index patient nor a previous history of hepatocellular carcinoma in the family was associated with an increase in the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the HBsAg-positive family members. 
Rules of language. Language and cognition have been explained as the products of a homogeneous associative memory structure or alternatively, of a set of genetically determined computational modules in which rules manipulate symbolic representations. Intensive study of one phenomenon of English grammar and how it is processed and acquired suggest that both theories are partly right. Regular verbs (walk-walked) are computed by a suffixation rule in a neural system for grammatical processing; irregular verbs (run-ran) are retrieved from an associative memory. 
Role of renal sympathetic nerve activity in renal failure associated with obstructive jaundice in the rat. The propensity for renal failure associated with obstructive jaundice and liver disease may be related to enhanced vasoconstriction of the renal vascular bed with resultant decreases in renal blood flow. Renal sympathetic nervous activity may be a mediator of this effect. The increased renal production of prostaglandins which has been observed in previous models of bile duct ligation may serve to counterbalance the effects of such vasoconstricting influences. This study was undertaken to assess the effect of bile duct ligation on renal function and prostaglandin production in the rat. Furthermore, this study was designed to determine if renal sympathetic nerve activity contributes to the development of renal failure after bile duct ligation. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent either sham operation (n = 8), bilateral renal denervation (n = 10), bile duct ligation alone (n = 11), or bile duct ligation and bilateral renal denervation (n = 10). Renal function was assessed before and 4 days after operation. Bile duct ligation resulted in a 46% decrease in creatinine clearance (p less than 0.01), a 33% decrease in urinary sodium excretion (p less than 0.01), a twofold increase in urine flow (p less than 0.01), and twofold increases in urinary excretion of PGE2, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha, and thromboxane B2 (p less than 0.01). Renal denervation did not prevent the decreases in creatinine clearance and sodium excretion seen after bile duct ligation and had no effect on the changes in urine flow and prostaglandin excretion. These findings demonstrate that bile duct ligation in the rat results in impaired renal function, accompanied by increases in renal prostaglandin production. In addition, this study indicates that the perturbations in renal function and renal prostaglandin production induced by bile duct ligation are not mediated by renal sympathetic nerve activity. 
Human papillomavirus DNA in anal carcinomas. Comparison of in situ and dot blot hybridization. Because the sensitivities of individual hybridization techniques differ considerably, their role in accounting for the published frequencies of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in anal squamous cell carcinomas, ranging from 0 to 61%, must be investigated. With the use of biotinylated probes to HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33, three hybridization techniques were performed on the same paraffin-embedded tissue blocks selected from 13 cases of anal squamous cell carcinoma. HPV DNA was detected in 0%, 62%, and 85% of cases with the use of in situ hybridization with horseradish peroxidase, in situ hybridization with alkaline phosphatase, and dot blot hybridization, respectively. By dot blot hybridization, 69% had HPV 16/6 and 15% had HPV 6/11. An HPV DNA frequency range of 0-85% in the same group of tumors with the use of three hybridization techniques indicates the influential role of the method on HPV DNA prevalences. HPV DNA was identified regardless of patient gender or type of squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of HPV 16 in 82% of the positive cases in supportive evidence of the carcinogenic role of the HPV in anal squamous cell carcinoma. 
Depression, chronic fatigue, and the premenstrual syndrome. Depression, chronic fatigue, and premenstrual syndrome often coexist in women seeking treatment for premenstrual distress. A reliable diagnosis can be made by prospectively rating symptoms for two cycles, taking a careful history, performing physical and gynecologic examinations, and obtaining basic laboratory test results and a psychosocial evaluation. Appropriate dietary, hormonal, or antidepressant treatment provided in a caring and competent manner can benefit many women suffering from this otherwise disabling/condition. 
Usefulness of a writing device in writer's cramp. Fifteen of 20 patients with writer's cramp treated with a writing device noted an improvement in their writing ability, some quite marked. Despite this benefit, nine patients preferred to use alternate methods. In the absence of adverse effects, we suggest that trials of writing devices be the first recourse for all patients with writer's cramp requiring treatment. 
Cryptosporidiosis of the biliary tract in AIDS. Cryptosporidiosis of the biliary system was studied retrospectively in 13 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The diagnosis was made by means of histologic examination (n = 9) or imaging studies and the presence of intestinal cryptosporidiosis (n = 4). Imaging studies were done in 10 patients. Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) showed dilatation of the biliary ducts, some with wall thickening, thickening of the gallbladder wall and pericholecystic fluid. Cholangiograms showed attenuation and pruning of the intrahepatic bile ducts, some with beading and dilatation of the common bile duct. Three patients had papillary stenosis. Numerous Cryptosporidium organisms were found in three resected gallbladders and in the biliary ducts of seven patients in whom autopsy was performed, accompanied by an exuberant inflammatory response. Correlation of the radiologic and pathologic findings establishes a direct etiologic role of Cryptosporidium as one of the major infectious agents in cholangitis associated with AIDS. 
Magnetic resonance imaging in preterm infants. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 9 preterm infants at 37-43 weeks postmenstrual age. They all were born at 26-35 weeks gestation. Myelination was graded according to its most cephalic location. Myelination pattern 2 (myelination observed in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent structures of the thalamus and lenticular nucleus) was demonstrated in 2 infants, pattern 3 (myelination of the corona radiata) in 3 infants, and pattern 4 (myelination of the centrum semiovale) in 4 infants. Bilateral low intensity areas were found on T1-weighted images in 7 infants and a ribbon-like, high intensity was observed in 5. These findings revealed a wide variety of magnetic resonance imaging appearance in apparently normal preterm infants. Caution is needed in interpreting the pathologic nature of such features in preterm infants during the perinatal period. 
Impact of changing attitudes in carotid surgery on community hospital practice. In 1985, institutional guidelines for the evaluation and performance of carotid surgery were established in our community hospital. During the 5-year period from 1985 through 1989, 159 carotid reconstructions were done. There were four major strokes (3%), one eventually resulting in death, with the second death in this series from a myocardial infarction (mortality 1%). The combined mortality/major stroke morbidity incidence was 3%. Three transient ischemic attacks (2%) postoperatively cleared promptly without residua. During the latter 1980s, an increasing number of vascular surgeons were doing less carotid surgery. Monitoring institutional quality assurance and individual surgeon performance within the community hospital is becoming a reality. Our experience with institutional guidelines for the evaluation and conduct of carotid surgery, together with an assessment of results and ongoing individual surgeon performance, is presented. Maintaining acceptable morbidity and mortality statistics can be enhanced by having a plan for assessment, management, and concurrent review. 
In situ DNA hybridization analysis of oral papillomas, leukoplakias, and carcinomas for human papillomavirus. Twenty-one papillomas, 23 ordinary benign keratoses, 13 smokeless tobacco keratoses, 10 verrucous hyperplasias, 10 verrucous carcinomas, 17 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 epithelial dysplasias, and 6 lichen planus lesions were evaluated for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35, with biotinylated double-stranded DNA probes by in situ hybridization. Sixty-two percent (13/21) of oral squamous papillomas were positive for HPV DNA. HPV DNA types 6 and 11 demonstrated the strongest reactivity. Of the 13 cases, 10 also showed some reactivity with HPV-16/18 and -31/33/35. None of the cases of keratoses, epithelial dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous hyperplasia, verrucous carcinoma, or lichen planus were positive for HPV DNA. This study confirms the consistent and frequent finding of HPV DNA in oral squamous cell papillomas and the inconsistency of being able to identify HPV DNA in keratotic, premalignant, or cancerous lesions of the oral mucous membranes. 
Atrial fibrillation as an independent risk factor for stroke: the Framingham Study. The impact of nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation, hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on stroke incidence was examined in 5,070 participants in the Framingham Study after 34 years of follow-up. Compared with subjects free of these conditions, the age-adjusted incidence of stroke was more than doubled in the presence of coronary heart disease (p less than 0.001) and more than trebled in the presence of hypertension (p less than 0.001). There was a more than fourfold excess of stroke in subjects with cardiac failure (p less than 0.001) and a near fivefold excess when atrial fibrillation was present (p less than 0.001). In persons with coronary heart disease or cardiac failure, atrial fibrillation doubled the stroke risk in men and trebled the risk in women. With increasing age the effects of hypertension, coronary heart disease, and cardiac failure on the risk of stroke became progressively weaker (p less than 0.05). Advancing age, however, did not reduce the significant impact of atrial fibrillation. For persons aged 80-89 years, atrial fibrillation was the sole cardiovascular condition to exert an independent effect on stroke incidence (p less than 0.001). The attributable risk of stroke for all cardiovascular contributors decreased with age except for atrial fibrillation, for which the attributable risk increased significantly (p less than 0.01), rising from 1.5% for those aged 50-59 years to 23.5% for those aged 80-89 years. While these findings highlight the impact of each cardiovascular condition on the risk of stroke, the data suggest that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to stroke when atrial fibrillation is present. 
Single potential analysis of cavernous electrical activity in impotent patients: a possible diagnostic method for autonomic cavernous dysfunction and cavernous smooth muscle degeneration. Cavernous electrical activity was recorded in 214 patients with erectile dysfunction and in 39 normal patients. In 34 of the 39 normal patients potentials of a uniform shape were recorded during flaccidity. At cutoff frequencies of 0.5 to 500 Hz. the duration was 8 to 18 seconds (mean 12.8 +/- 2.8, seconds, standard deviation), the amplitude was 250 to 750 microv. (mean 444 +/- 109 microv.) and the polyphasity was 8 to 22 (mean 13.8 +/- 3.3). With increasing tumescence and rigidity during audiovisual sexual stimulation, high frequency potentials of low amplitude and short duration were found in the normal patients. In impotent patients with an upper motor neuron or peripheral lesion specific types of potentials were observed. In 11 of 14 impotent patients with insulin-dependent diabetes for more than 20 years and with clinical findings of cavernous myopathy the potentials showed low amplitude, irregular shape and slow depolarizations. Abnormal findings of cavernous electrical activity were recorded in 51.6% of the consecutive impotent patients. Our clinical study suggests that single potential analysis of cavernous electrical activity may be useful in the diagnosis of cavernous autonomic neuropathy and cavernous smooth muscle myopathy. 
Choice of anesthetic technique for needle localized breast biopsy. General anesthesia has been recommended to increase the accuracy and safety of needle localized biopsy (NLB). The authors' NLB experience was reviewed to determine whether the method of anesthesia affected accuracy, yield, complication rate, or cost. All biopsies were performed in a standard operating room using either local anesthesia (Group 1, n = 14), local anesthesia with an anesthesiologist present (Group 2, n = 14), or general anesthesia (Group 3, n = 10). The mean operative times were 54, 59, and 56 minutes for Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In groups 1 and 2, 100 per cent of the specimen radiographs showed the target lesion had been excised, although one biopsy was indeterminate. Among Group 3 two target lesions could not be identified on specimen radiographs and one was indeterminate. There was one malignancy in Group 1 compared with four malignancies in Group 2 and two in Group 3. The average hospital bill was $1,172 for Group 1, $1,418 for Group 2, and $1,488 for Group 3. Anesthesiologists' fees added an additional $224 to Groups 2 and 3. NLB can be performed using local anesthesia without sacrificing accuracy or yield, increasing operative time, or increasing complication rate; the cost is significantly less than with general anesthesia. 
Importance of viability and attachment to an ascites tumor in the release of plasminogen activator. Tumor plasminogen activator (PA) has been alleged to play a role in the growth and metastasis of tumors. Before such a role can be realized, PA first must be released from tumor cells. Having determined intra- and extracellular PA and PA-inhibitor activities in an experimental pancreatic ascites tumor grown in hamsters, the release of PA from these cells was investigated. No PA activity was detected in the suspension medium of freshly isolated tumor cells; inclusion of plasminogen, fibrinogen, or collagen in the medium yielded similar negative results. On the other hand, PA activity was demonstrated to be released in a time-dependent manner from these tumor cells embedded in fibrin clots. Plasminogen activator activity also was not found in the suspension medium of frozen-thawed tumor cells, despite the fact that most of them had breaks on their cell membrane. Unlike freshly isolated tumor cells, PA was not released from frozen-thawed cells embedded in fibrin clots. Full PA activity was demonstrated in frozen-thawed cells treated with Triton X-100, however. Frozen-thawed cells exhibited signs of severe damage, and more than 80% of them failed to exclude trypan blue. Obviously PA is released from viable tumor cells embedded in fibrin clots but not suspended in artificial medium. The PA-release mechanism, not PA itself, is destroyed in cells rendered nonviable by freeze thawing. 
The negative association in women between cigarette smoking and uncomplicated angina pectoris in the Framingham Heart Study data. As a result of a more complete analysis of available Framingham Heart Study data on the association of cigarette smoking to incidence of uncomplicated angina pectoris than has previously been published in Framingham papers, it was determined that there is a consistently negative risk factor association for women at every follow-up period from 12 to 30 years, with Framingham women cigarette smokers experiencing 30-40% lower rates of uncomplicated angina pectoris than non-smokers, the rates also declining with increasing amounts of cigarettes smoked. Our analysis confirms the absence of a predictive risk factor association in the case of men previously indicated by Framingham investigators. The published declarations by Framingham investigators of an absence of association between cigarette smoking and angina pectoris in Framingham women, is a failure to publicly recognize the distinctive negative association present in the Framingham female data. The Framingham data on the relationship of smoking to angina incidence is clearly at variance with the Surgeon General's sketchy finding of an inconsistent positive association for men and an uncertain relationship for women. It is suggested that special attention should be directed to these results of the Framingham data because of the preeminence of Framingham material world wide, because angina pectoris is the most common manifestation of coronary heart disease, because it will improve the "conventional wisdom" on this subject, and because the negative relationship found for Framingham women does not lend support to the belief held by some that smoking enhances the degree of coronary atherosclerosis. 
Antihypertensive effect of cicletanine is exaggerated in NaCl-sensitive hypertension. Cicletanine (CIC), a furopyridine derivative, lowers blood pressure in hypertensive animals and humans. We have previously identified an NaCl-sensitive substrain of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-S) that displays enhanced sensitivity to the depressor effects of exogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) when fed a high NaCl diet. The current study tested the hypotheses that CIC has an exaggerated antihypertensive effect in NaCl-supplemented SHR-S and that this effect might be ANP dependent. CIC (40 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was administered by gavage in a single daily dose for three weeks beginning immediately prior to initiation of 1% or 8% NaCl diets in seven-week-old male SHR-S. CIC significantly decreased mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the ratio of left ventricular and septum weight to body weight (LV + S/BW) in both 8% NaCl- and 1% NaCl-fed SHR-S. The depressor effect of CIC was greater in the 8% NaCl group (-26 mmHg) than in the 1% NaCl group (-13 mmHg). CIC was associated with significant reduction in RAP in the 8% NaCl group but not in the 1% NaCl group. Neither CIC treatment nor 8% NaCl significantly altered plasma ANP or cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP) levels in plasma, aorta, or kidney. CIC was associated with significant decreases in plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels in the 1% NaCl group but not in the 8% NaCl group. The data demonstrate that the antihypertensive effect of CIC is exaggerated in NaCl-sensitive hypertension. The antihypertensive effect of CIC appears not to be related to ANP or cyclic GMP but may be related to a combination of a sympatholytic and natriuretic/diuretic effects in SHR-S. 
MR imaging of the portal venous system: value of gradient-echo imaging as an adjunct to spin-echo imaging. We evaluated the use of gradient-echo (GRE) as an adjunct to spin-echo (SE) MR imaging of the portal venous system. GRE imaging was performed in 31 subjects, 15 normal volunteers and 16 patients with documented portal venous disease (15 cases) or suspected disease (one case). Eight of 16 patients had venous thrombosis, five had focal thrombus, and three had complete occlusion. Six patients had extrinsic venous compression by tumor. Of the two other patients, one had an arteriovenous fistula and the other a falsely positive angiogram, suggesting portal vein occlusion. In normal subjects, GRE scans had excellent visualization of the portal venous system with high intravascular signal compared with surrounding tissues. Nine (60%) of 15 normal subjects and three patients had an artifact consisting of a curvilinear area of decreased signal that could mimic clot. In three of five patients with focal thrombus, clot was identified on GRE but not on SE images. In all three patients with occlusion, SE and GRE images demonstrated similar findings. In five of the six patients with extrinsic venous compression by tumor, SE and GRE studies showed similar findings. Of the two patients, an arteriovenous fistula was seen on GRE MR in one, and in the other, patency of the left portal vein was seen on SE and GRE images after angiography had suggested portal vein occlusion. Collateral vessels were seen in nine of 16 patients. In five of nine cases, GRE MR demonstrated more extensive collaterals than did SE MR. In summary, GRE MR provides a useful adjunct to standard SE MR imaging. Benefits include high contrast between vascular structures and surrounding tissues, reduced motion artifact, and rapid scanning within a breath-hold. 
Hyperdiploidy and trisomy of chromosome 15 in peritoneal macrophages of hyperimmune, older Swiss mice. Chromosome analysis was carried out in resident and exudate peritoneal macrophages and, also, in bone marrow cells of groups of mice either immunized with ovalbumin in complete Freund's adjuvant and challenged with the antigen, or stimulated with the irritant thioglycollic acid. Labeling of the phagocytic cells with colloidal carbon showed that dividing cells in the peritoneal cavity of experimental mice are resident macrophages. Also shown was an increase in number of hyperdiploid metaphases in hyperimmune, older mice but not in the young ones. Statistical analysis showed these differences to be significant. G-banding of hyperdiploid cells of hyperimmune older mice showed trisomy of chromosome 15 in several metaphases analyzed. The absence of hyperdiploid metaphases in the bone marrow cells of hyperimmune mice and in exudate macrophages of mice that received the irritant thioglycollic acid suggests that hyperdiploidy occurs in resident macrophages in the peritoneal cavity but not in their precursors in the bone marrow. These results raise some questions such as, hyperimmune older mice resident macrophages being prone to hyperdiploidy and trisomy of chromosome 15. 
Relationship between length and surface area of each segment of the large intestine and the incidence of colorectal cancer. In investigating the occurrence and clinical characteristics of diseases of the large intestine, particularly tumors, the number, distribution, and incidence of the lesions were compared between segments of the large intestine. If the distribution and incidence of lesions are correlated with the length or surface area of each segment, the incidence of lesions will be the same throughout the large intestine. If the lesions are unrelated to length or surface area, the factors that affect the occurrence of lesions must be determined and will be characteristic for each segment. However, the length and surface area of each segment of the large intestine and the ratios of each to both the total length and surface area of the large intestine are not clear. In this study the length and surface area of each segment of the large intestine were measured and calculated using the barium enema technique, and the incidence rates of cancer per unit length and surface area of each segment were determined and compared. 
Clinical significance of the V-shaped space in the subluxed shoulder of hemiplegics. Recently, it has been proposed that shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia is accompanied by 1) the appearance of a V-shaped articular configuration occurring between the humeral head and glenoid fossa and 2) the presence of chronic pain. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of these statements. We evaluated 40 hemiplegic subjects over 3 months. Radiographs of the affected and nonaffected shoulders were taken at both a frontal plane (0 degree) and a 45 degree incidence. From these patients, subluxed (n = 19) and nonsubluxed (n = 21) groups were formed. Pain was evaluated using the Present Pain Intensity index of the McGill Pain Questionnaire. On these x-ray films, measurements were taken of the V-shaped space, abduction of the arm, and rotation of the scapula. The statistical analysis (analysis of variance for repeated measures) contrasted the results obtained from the nonaffected side with those from the affected side over the 3 months studied. At the 45 degree angle, which better exposes the articular configuration of the shoulder, the difference in the V angle between the affected and nonaffected shoulders was significant for the subluxed group (p less than 0.01), indicating that such a V-shaped space can be identified. The measures taken also indicate that a downward subluxation of the humeral head occurs relative to the scapula without any systematic abduction of the humerus or downward rotation of the scapula. None of the results obtained from the frontal plane x-ray films was significant. Finally, no significant relation was found between subluxation and shoulder pain. 
Fistulous degeneration of a giant esophageal ulcer in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Esophageal involvement in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease can take many forms, including the recently described giant solitary ulcerations thought to be due to cytomegalovirus or, more recently, Mycobacterium species. Current experience suggests that steroids may provide symptom relief and healing in selected patients. We report a case of fistulous change in one such ulcer, with documented endoscopic, radiologic, and pathologic findings. No organism was identified by culture or pathologic staining, leading to a postulated role for the persistent irritation of medications. 
Maintenance therapy with sucralfate in duodenal ulcer: genuine prevention or accelerated healing of ulcer recurrence? We sought to compare the efficacy of sucralfate to placebo for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence and to determine that the efficacy of sucralfate was due to a true reduction in ulcer prevalence and not due to secondary effects such as analgesic activity or accelerated healing. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, multicenter clinical study with 254 patients. All patients had a past history of at least two duodenal ulcers with at least one ulcer diagnosed by endoscopic examination 3 months or less before the start of the study. Complete ulcer healing without erosions was required to enter the study. Sucralfate or placebo were dosed as a 1-g tablet twice a day for 4 months, or until ulcer recurrence. Endoscopic examinations once a month and when symptoms developed determined the presence or absence of duodenal ulcers. If a patient developed an ulcer between monthly scheduled visits, the patient was dosed with a 1-g sucralfate tablet twice a day until the next scheduled visit. Statistical analyses of the results determined the efficacy of sucralfate compared with placebo for preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence. Comparisons of therapeutic agents for preventing duodenal ulcers have usually been made by testing for statistical differences in the cumulative rates for all ulcers developed during a follow-up period, regardless of the time of detection. Statistical experts at the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and on the FDA Advisory Panel expressed doubts about clinical study results based on this type of analysis. They suggested three possible mechanisms for reducing the number of observed ulcers: (a) analgesic effects, (b) accelerated healing, and (c) true ulcer prevention. Traditional ulcer analysis could miss recurring ulcers due to an analgesic effect or accelerated healing. Point-prevalence analysis could miss recurring ulcers due to accelerated healing between endoscopic examinations. Maximum ulcer analyses, a novel statistical method, eliminated analgesic effects by regularly scheduled endoscopies and accelerated healing of recurring ulcers by frequent endoscopies and an open-label phase. Maximum ulcer analysis reflects true ulcer recurrence and prevention. Sucralfate was significantly superior to placebo in reducing ulcer prevalence by all analyses. Significance (p less than 0.05) was found at months 3 and 4 for all analyses. All months were significant in the traditional analysis, months 2-4 in point-prevalence analysis, and months 3-4 in the maximal ulcer prevalence analysis. Sucralfate was shown to be effective for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence by a true reduction in new ulcer development. 
Application of intermediate biomarkers to studies of cancer prevention in the gastrointestinal tract: introduction and perspective. In this article, abnormalities in the proliferation and differentiation of gastrointestinal cells are described in diseases that increase predisposition to gastrointestinal cancer. Recent findings related to the effects of calcium on gastrointestinal cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumor occurrence in rodent models and in human subjects are summarized. 
Consolidation with intraperitoneal cisplatin in first-line therapy of advanced ovarian cancer. Seventy-five patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer were treated with a combined modality regimen of systemic, induction chemotherapy followed by intraperitoneal therapy (IPT). All patients underwent initial surgery for staging and/or cytoreduction followed by cisplatin 20 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) for 5 days and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on day 4 every 3 to 4 weeks for two to four cycles. Patients were then evaluated for IPT and, if eligible, had an intraperitoneal (IP) catheter placed. IPT consisted of cisplatin 60 mg/m2 in 2 L on day 1 and IV cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 on day 2 every 3 weeks for three to six cycles. Patients who demonstrated a clinical complete response (CCR) were then referred for second-look laparotomy (SLL). Of 71 patients who completed the induction phase, 53 (75%) were eligible for IPT, and 49 patients entered the therapy phase. Toxicity of the combined modality approach was acceptable and did not differ from our previous experience using the same drugs systemically. Thirty-two of the 49 patients who completed IPT achieved a CCR, which was confirmed by SLL in 20 patients. Twenty recurrences were documented in the 32 CCR patients, 13 occurred in patients after SLL. Projected median survival of all patients is 38 months. Median survival correlated with amount of residual disease following initial surgery (23 months for bulky v 45 months for minimal residual; P less than .001) and with performance status ([PS]; 24 months for PS 2, 3 v greater than 46 months for PS O; P less than .001). Patients who presented with bulky tumors were less likely to reach the consolidation IPT phase. Incorporation of IP cisplatin into the first-line regimen for treatment of ovarian cancer does not appear to have major impact on the survival of all treated patients when compared with our historical control series. Combined IV and IPT cisplatin and cyclophosphamide is feasible with acceptable toxicity. Its impact on response and survival may be limited to only "good-prognosis" patients. 
Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection, tearing, etc. (SUNCT): III. Another Norwegian case. "SUNCT" is a recently reported head pain syndrome characterized by shortlasting, unilateral neuralgiform paroxysms with conjunctival injection and tearing, and to a lesser extent nasal secretion, and (subclinical) sweating. Another case--that of a 56 year old male--is reported herein. The attacks lasted 1/2-1 min. and occurred only infrequently, i.e. once or twice in 1-4 weeks, except for a week recently when there were up to 20 or more typical attacks per day, with the usual ipsilateral, autonomic accompaniments. Due to the benign nature and low frequency of attacks, the diagnosis would have been most difficult to establish prior to the occurrence of this shortlasting period with more marked symptoms. A variety of precipitation mechanisms were present, partly concerning the V 2-3 areas, partly concerning the neck. Precipitation mechanisms in "SUNCT" to some extent seem to differ from those in trigeminal neuralgia. It is remarkable that all four hitherto reported cases are males. 
Comparison of usefulness of high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography and exercise electrocardiography for detection of asymptomatic restenosis after coronary angioplasty. The present study compares the relative usefulness of the maximal treadmill exercise electrocardiography test with the high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography test (echocardiographic monitoring during dipyridamole infusion up to 0.84 mg/kg in 10 minutes) in detecting severe restenosis or coronary artery disease progression (greater than 70% stenosis) in asymptomatic patients 12 months after a primary successful coronary angioplasty. Criteria of positivity were: for the exercise electrocardiography test, an ST-segment shift greater than or equal to 0.1 mV from baseline, 0.08 second from the J point; for the dipyridamole echocardiography test, a transient dyssynergy of contraction, absent or of a lesser degree than that in the baseline examination. The exercise electrocardiography and dipyridamole echocardiography tests revealed a similar feasibility (91 vs 87%, difference not significant). Both tests could be performed in 75 patients. For detection of restenosis or disease progression, or both, the exercise electrocardiography test revealed a sensitivity similar to the dipyridamole echocardiography test (71 vs 71%, difference not significant), but a lower specificity (61 vs 90%). It is concluded that the high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography test is equally feasible but more accurate than the exercise electrocardiography test for noninvasive detection of severe asymptomatic restenosis or disease progression at 1 year after successful coronary angioplasty. 
Cis- and trans-repression of class I major histocompatibility gene expression in Abelson virus-transformed murine leukemia. Numerous tumor cell lines of leukemic origin are known to modulate cell surface expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens resulting in alterations in their immune detection and tumorigenicity. We have been studying the mechanisms responsible for attenuation of MHC class I gene expression in an H-2 heterozygous (H-2b x H-2d) Abelson-Murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV)-transformed leukemic cell line (designated R8). Here we report that treatment of the R8 cell line with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) increased H-2Kb steady-state messenger RNA (mRNA) levels several fold. The induced H-2Kb mRNA transcripts were functional, as demonstrated by their ability to be translated into immunoprecipitable H-2Kb alloantigen. H-2Kb null variants derived from the R8 cell line were shown to be the product of both cis- and trans-acting mechanisms, insomuch as the treatment of R8-derived H-2Kb non-expressor lines with CHX re-established expression of H-2Kb mRNA to the same extent as transfection of the variant cell line with the wild-type H-2Kb gene. Such findings indicate that downregulation of MHC class I gene expression is constitutive for the R8 leukemic cell line, a phenomenon that may be related to the immature pre-B-cell phenotype of this A-MuLV transformant. 
Smoking cessation following admission to a coronary care unit. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of an episode of serious cardiovascular disease on smoking behavior and to identify factors associated with smoking cessation in this setting. DESIGN: Prospective observational study in which smokers admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) were followed for one year after hospital discharge to determine subsequent smoking behavior. SETTING: Coronary care unit of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Preadmission smoking status was assessed in all 828 patients admitted to the CCU during one year. The 310 smokers surviving to hospital discharge were followed and their smoking behaviors assessed by self-report at six and 12 months. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Six months after discharge, 32% of survivors were not smoking; the rate of sustained cessation at one year was 25%. Smokers with a new diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) made during hospitalization had the highest cessation rate (53% vs. 31%, p = 0.01). On multivariate analysis, smoking cessation was more likely if patients were discharged with a diagnosis of CHD, had no prior history of CHD, were lighter smokers (less than 1 pack/day), and had congestive heart failure during hospitalization. Among smokers admitted because of suspected myocardial infarction (MI), cessation was more likely if the diagnosis was CHD than if it was noncoronary (37% vs. 19%, p less than 0.05), but a diagnosis of MI led to no more smoking cessation than did coronary insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Hospitalization in a CCU is a stimulus to long-term smoking cessation, especially for lighter smokers and those with a new diagnosis of CHD. Admission to a CCU may represent a time when smoking habits are particularly susceptible to intervention. Smoking cessation in this setting should improve patient outcomes because cessation reduces cardiovascular mortality, even when quitting occurs after the onset of CHD. 
Cerebral abnormalities in congenital myotonic dystrophy. The brain structure of 14 infants born with congenital myotonic dystrophy at 2 hospitals was evaluated by cranial ultrasonography, and the findings were correlated with clinical and neuropathologic data. Ventricular dilation was diagnosed in 11 infants (78%). Seven infants died during the neonatal period; all had ventricular dilation which remained essentially static. In the ultrasound scans of the 5 infants with ventricular dilation. Of the 7 survivors, 4 had ventricular dilation born at 1 hospital, 4 had widening of the interhemispheric fissure. Macrocephaly, a previously unrecognized finding in congenital myotonic dystrophy, was present in 10 infants (71%), 8 of whom presented with ventricular dilation. None had clinical evidence of increased intracranial pressure. There was no ventricular obstruction in the 4 brains examined pathologically. Histologic examination revealed minor expression of neuronal migrational disturbances in each patient. Macrocephaly together with the ultrasonographic and neuropathologic findings in our patients suggest that these abnormalities may originate in an external hydrocephalus. 
The treatment of atypical lipoma with liposuction. Large lipomas may best be treated with liposuction. Once a lipoma enlarges to 4 cm or more, liposuction has several advantages over conventional surgery. A well-demarcated lipoma 15 cm in diameter and deep to muscle was treated by liposuction. Biopsy showed an atypical lipoma. Because the entire tumor was removed by liposuction, we feel that the prognosis is excellent. The cosmesis and morbidity results were far superior to those anticipated with conventional excisional surgery. Small superficial lipomas may be treated by suction lipectomy and the surrounding area can be contoured symmetrically at the same time, whereas large ones can be liposuctioned completely without extensive surgical extirpation and morbidity. Because such big lesions may represent atypical lipomas or liposarcomas, care must be taken to remove the entire tumor. 
Characteristics of serial electrocardiograms in heart transplant recipients. To characterize "normal electrocardiogram patterns" after transplantation, serial surface 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) taken 2 weeks, 1 month, and 1 year postoperatively in a group of 50 heart transplant recipients were analyzed and were correlated with clinical parameters. Some recipient atrial activity was evident in 40% of patients at 2 weeks, but in only 16% at 1 year; donor atrial activity was normal in 90% to 94% of patients at all times. ECG intervals generally were normal and did not change over time. The most prevalent abnormality was the presence of incomplete (IRBBB) or complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) patterns (14% at 2 weeks, 16% at 1 month, and 22% at 1 year). In patients with hemodynamic measurements available approximately at the time of the ECG recording 1 year following transplantation, there was a significant correlation between the presence of IRBBB and RBBB patterns and somewhat higher levels of right atrial mean pressure (6.8 versus 3.9 mm Hg, p = 0.01), pulmonary artery systolic pressure (32.5 versus 24.5 mm Hg, p = 0.001) and diastolic pressure (16.2 versus 11.2 mm Hg, p = 0.004), and right ventricular systolic pressure (31.4 versus 26.9 mm Hg, p = 0.019) and pulmonary artery wedge mean pressure (11.3 versus 7.9 mm Hg, p = 0.010). Repolarization changes were also common but decreased in frequency over time (78% at 2 weeks to 34% at 1 year) and did not correlate with the presence or absence of rejection. We conclude that ECG abnormalities in heart transplant recipients are generally mild and that IRBBB and RBBB patterns correlate with increased right heart pressures. 
Importance of ulceration of carotid plaque in determining symptoms of cerebral ischemia. In order to investigate the relationship between carotid plaque morphology and symptoms of cerebral ischemia, a prospective clinicopathological study was performed. Ninety consecutive intact carotid plaques obtained from surgery and 43 carotid plaques from cadavers without symptoms of cerebral ischemia were evaluated. Ulceration and mural thrombus were the only morphologic findings statistically correlated to the presence of hemispheric symptoms (p less than 0.02). Intramural hemorrhage was more common in patients with hemispheric symptoms but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). Plaque causing high degree stenosis had a higher incidence of intramural hemorrhage (p = 0.04) and ulceration (p less than 0.02). Ulceration of plaque plays a major role in the onset of hemispheric symptoms. The results of our study support the hypothesis that in the majority of the cases, hemispheric symptoms are embolic in nature. 
Myasthenia gravis. T epitopes on the delta subunit of human muscle acetylcholine receptor. Autoimmune T cell lines specific for muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) were propagated from the blood of three myasthenia gravis patients by the use of a pool of synthetic peptides (delta-pool) corresponding to the complete sequence of the delta-subunit of human muscle AChR. Propagation of AChR-specific T cell lines was attempted unsuccessfully from four other myasthenia gravis patients and from four healthy controls. The lines had CD3+, CD4+, CD8- phenotype, strongly recognized the delta-pool, and cross-reacted vigorously with non-denatured AChR purified from mammalian muscle. They did not cross-react detectably with pools of similar overlapping synthetic peptides corresponding to the complete sequences of the alpha- and gamma-subunits of human muscle AChR. The sequence segments of the delta-subunit that contain T epitopes were identified by investigating the response of the three CD4+ T cell lines to the individual synthetic peptides forming the delta-pool. Each line had an individual pattern of peptide recognition. Although no immunodominant region, recognized in association with different DR haplotypes, could be identified, the sequence segments most strongly recognized by the CD4+ T cell lines were clustered within residues 121-290. One of the peptides more strongly recognized by the T cells corresponded to a sequence segment with high predicted propensity to form an amphipathic alpha-helix, a structural motif proposed to be typical of T epitopes. 
Cell associated urokinase activity and colonic epithelial cells in health and disease. It is not known if urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is associated with normal colonic epithelial cells. The aims of this study were to determine if normal colonic epithelial cells have uPA activity and whether this is concentrated at the cell membrane. In addition, the contribution of colonic epithelial cell associated uPA activity to disease related pertubations of mucosal uPA activity were examined. A highly enriched population of colonic epithelial cells was isolated from resected colon or biopsy specimens by an enzymatic technique. uPA activity was measured in cell homogenates by a specific and sensitive colorimetric method and expressed relative to cellular DNA. In two experiments subcellular fractionation of colonic epithelial cells was performed by nitrogen cavitation followed by ultracentrifugation over a linear sucrose gradient. The fractions collected were analysed for uPA and organelle-specific enzyme activities. Normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity (mean (SEM) 5.6 (1.1) IU/mg, n = 18). This colocalised with fractions enriched for leucine-beta-naphthylamidase and 5'-nucleotidase, markers of plasma membrane. uPA activities in epithelial cells from cancerous colons (9.8 (3.1) n = 7) or from mucosa affected by inflammatory bowel disease (3.8 (0.7) n = 15) were not significantly different from normal (paired t test), while that in epithelial cells from greatly inflamed mucosa was similar to that from autologous normal or mildly inflamed areas (4.4 (1.2) v 5.9 (3.6), n = 9). Thus normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity which is concentrated on the plasma membranes, suggesting the presence of uPA receptors. 
Recurrent prolonged coma due to basilar artery migraine. A case report. A 25 year old patient presented with recurrent prolonged episodes of life-threatening coma varying from 3 to 10 days. The clinical recovery was slow. The history and technical examinations led to the diagnosis of basilar artery migraine (BAM). The etiology of the coma episodes is thought to be related to ischemic dysfunction of the rostral part of the brainstem due to severe spasm of the basilar artery demonstrated by arteriography. Exceptional are the recurrent prolonged coma episodes of sudden onset, the severe spasm of the basilar artery, and the suppression-burst and FIRDA pattern on the EEG examinations during the coma episodes. 
Sex differences in the management of coronary artery disease. Survival and Ventricular Enlargement Investigators BACKGROUND. Despite the fact that coronary artery disease is the leading cause of death among women, previous studies have suggested that physicians are less likely to pursue an aggressive approach to coronary artery disease in women than in men. To define this issue further, we compared the care previously received by men and women who were enrolled in a large postinfarction intervention trial. METHODS. We assessed the nature and severity of anginal symptoms and the use of antianginal and antiischemic interventions before enrollment in the 1842 men and 389 women with left ventricular ejection fractions less than or equal to 40 percent after an acute myocardial infarction who were randomized in the Survival and Ventricular Enlargement trial. RESULTS. Before their index infarction, women were as likely as men to have had angina and to have been treated with antianginal drugs. However, despite reports by women of symptoms consistent with greater functional disability from angina, fewer women had undergone cardiac catheterization (15.4 percent of women vs. 27.3 percent of men, P less than 0.001) or coronary bypass surgery (5.9 percent of women vs. 12.7 percent of men, P less than 0.001). When these differences were adjusted for important covariates, men were still twice as likely to undergo an invasive cardiac procedure as women, but bypass surgery was performed with equal frequency among the men and women who did undergo cardiac catheterization. CONCLUSIONS. Physicians pursue a less aggressive management approach to coronary disease in women than in men, despite greater cardiac disability in women. 
Cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. High resolution computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head with 3-mm sections through the circle of Willis was obtained in 96 patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. These scans are well suited for the noninvasive, presymptomatic diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms at high risk of rupture, since the risk of rupture of unruptured aneurysms is heavily dependent on their size, and aneurysms equal to or larger than 6 mm in diameter are not likely to escape detection by these techniques. No definite aneurysm was observed in any of the 96 patients. Small areas (2-4 mm) of contrast enhancement or signal void were detected in 11 patients. These areas are possibly due to vascular tortuosity, but the studies were considered to be indeterminate because a small aneurysm could not be ruled out. Cerebral angiography in two of these 11 patients was normal. Arachnoid cysts were observed more frequently in the patients with polycystic kidney disease than in a control group of patients matched by gender, age, and type and date of examination. 
Distribution of the VLA family of integrins in normal and pathological human liver tissue. The "very late activation" (VLA) subgroup of the integrin superfamily of adhesion molecules plays a central role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The six different VLA dimers known so far consist of a common beta subunit and a variable alpha (1 to 6) subunit. They serve as receptors for laminin, collagen, and fibronectin or function as adhesion molecules for leukocytes and are therefore of great significance in embryogenesis, growth and repair, and in leukocyte recirculation. The distribution of the common beta and the variable alpha chains of the VLA were studied in normal, inflammatory, and cholestatic liver biopsy samples. In normal liver tissue, vascular endothelia express alpha 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; bile duct epithelium alpha 2, 3, 5, and 6; connective tissue stroma alpha 1 and 2; hepatocytes alpha 1 and 5; sinusoidal lining cells alpha 1, 2, and 5; and mononuclear cells alpha 4. Whereas bile ducts and vascular endothelia do not show relevant changes in alpha chain expression in liver diseases, hepatocytes de novo express membranous alpha 3 and 6 in inflammatory liver diseases. In view of the role of the VLA-3 and VLA-6 as laminin receptors, this finding is in line with the production of laminin in active liver disease. Moreover, de novo expression of "bile duct type" alpha 2, 3, and 6 on periportal hepatocytes in cholestatic liver disease likely illustrates a phenotypic switch of hepatocytes towards bile duct epithelium during cholestasis. 
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome in acute traumatic quadriplegia: case reports and literature review. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a condition in which the third portion of the duodenum is intermittently compressed by the overlying superior mesenteric artery, resulting in gastrointestinal obstruction. Predisposing factors include rapid weight loss, prolonged supine positioning, and using a spinal orthosis, all of which are common among acute traumatic quadriplegic patients. This paper presents three patients, aged 24, 16, and 20 years, with traumatic quadriplegia treated with supine positioning and cervical orthoses, who had postprandial nausea and emesis, bloating, and abdominal pain during rehabilitation. Upper gastrointestinal radiographic series demonstrated abrupt duodenal obstruction to barium flow in all three patients. Two of the patients had complete relief of symptoms with conservative management, and one required surgical duodenojejunostomy. Enhanced awareness of this condition may result in improved recognition of this disease as a cause of persistent, unexplained gastrointestinal disturbances in quadriplegic persons, thereby optimizing its treatment and reducing its potential morbidity. 
Placental bed spiral arteries in the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. OBJECTIVE--The investigation of the histology of the placental bed spiral arteries in normal pregnancy and in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, with or without proteinura. DESIGN--An observational study, based on women having caesarean sections for clinical reasons. SUBJECTS--17 normal pregnant women, 43 with gestational hypertension, of whom 39 had proteinuria, 17 with chronic hypertension, of whom 6 had proteinuria, and 5 with unclassified hypertension. INTERVENTIONS--Placental bed biopsies obtained during caesarean section. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Histological appearance of sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin PAS and Lendrum's MSB. RESULTS--Biopsies containing spiral arteries were obtained from 6 normotensive and 44 hypertensive women. Trophoblastic invasion was present in 5 of the 6 normotensive biopsies but absent in the majority of those with hypertension. Subintimal proliferation was seen in all the normotensive biopsies but in only 8 of 28 from those with gestational hypertension and proteinuria. Other features seen predominantly or only in the hypertensive biopsies, in order of frequency, were medial hyperplasia, fibrin deposits, acute atherosis, endothelial vacuolation and thrombosis. CONCLUSION--Absence of physiological changes may not be peculiar to preeclampsia but may be associated or even a result of various forms of hypertension in pregnancy. Spiral arteries show a spectrum of changes in hypertensive pregnancies that do not appear to bear a clear-cut relation to the clinical signs. 
Prostacyclin production by blood-contacting surfaces of endothelialized vascular prostheses. This study examines prostacyclin production by blood-contacting surfaces within woven vascular prostheses of polydioxanone (PDS), polyglactin 910 (PG910), or Dacron interposed into rabbit infrarenal aortas. Grafts and normal aortic segments were explanted after 1, 3, and 6 months for pulsatile perfusion with Medium-199 for 60 minutes. Aliquots were removed serially for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha assay. After 30 minutes sodium arachidonate (10 micrograms/ml) was added. Specimens were studied by light microscopy, SEM and TEM. Patency in all three groups exceeded 90%. All three showed re-endothelialization at one month. Normal aorta produced low basal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha with a marked evanescent post arachidonate increase. Dacron did not differ from normal aorta. PG910 and PDS both produced significantly less 6-keto-PGF1 alpha post arachidonate at one month but both increased to normal by three months. 
Choledochoduodenostomy. Analysis of 71 cases followed for 5 to 15 years. To investigate the long-term effectiveness of choledochoduodenostomy (CDD), the experience with 71 patients followed for 5 or more years after CDD was analyzed retrospectively. From 1968 to 1984, 134 patients underwent CDD. Eight patients (6%) died in the immediate postoperative period, 55 left the hospital, 8 of them were lost to follow-up, and 47 were followed but died before 5 years elapsed after CDD. The remaining 71 patients form the data base for this analysis: 38 were followed for more than 5 years, 25 were followed for more than 10 years, and 8 were followed for more than 15 years (mean 12.1 years +/- 1.3 SEM). Choledocholithiasis, chronic pancreatitis, and postoperative stricture were the indications for CDD. Cholangitis was observed in only three patients. The diameter of the common bile duct (CBD) was large in most patients (mean 18 mm +/- 0.9 SEM). These results infer that CDD is effective to treat non-neoplastic obstructing lesions of the distal CBD on a long-term basis and that the presence of a dilated CBD (more than 16 mm) that allows the construction of a CDD more than 14 mm is essential to obtain good results. 
The threshold for myocardial ischemia varies in patients with coronary artery disease depending on the exercise protocol. It is generally accepted that angina pectoris and, presumably, myocardial ischemia occur at a fixed heart rate-systolic blood pressure product in a given patient. This concept of a fixed threshold has recently been challenged. To evaluate the effects of varying exercise intensity on the ischemic threshold, 33 patients with coronary artery disease and provokable myocardial ischemia, documented by thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging, underwent two exercise tests 2 to 7 days apart. A symptom-limited incremental treadmill exercise test was followed by a 20 min submaximal treadmill test at an intensity approximating 70% of the peak heart rate attained during the incremental test. During the incremental exercise test, angina pectoris developed in 16 patients and 17 patients were asymptomatic. At least 0.1 mV of ST segment depression developed in all subjects during the incremental exercise test at a mean exercise duration of 5.3 +/- 2.6 min, a rate-pressure product of 19,130 +/- 5,735 and oxygen uptake of 19.6 +/- 7.0 ml/kg per min. During the submaximal exercise test, 28 (85%) of the 33 patients had significant ST segment depression. Of these patients, 24 (86%) were asymptomatic, including 10 patients who had previously reported anginal symptoms during the incremental test. The average time to onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression during the submaximal test was 8.1 +/- 4.5 min. These changes occurred at a rate-pressure product of 15,250 +/- 3,705 and an oxygen uptake of 14.3 +/- 5.9 ml/kg per min, and were significantly (p less than 0.001) lower than values observed during the graded exercise. 
Neurocysticercosis: regression of a fourth ventricular cyst with praziquantel. Symptomatic intraventricular cysticerci are said to respond poorly to the anticestodial agent praziquantel. A case is reported of rapid regression of a large cyst of the fourth ventricle after oral praziquantel, avoiding the need for surgery. 
Attitudes of family practice residents about speech-language-hearing referrals. The "family doctor" has been identified as the professional most likely to be contacted by the general public with concerns about communication disorders; yet the family practice physician is unlikely to refer patients with communicative disorders to speech-language pathologists or audiologists for nonmedical evaluation and treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine attitudes of family practice residents about referral patterns for communication disorders using a survey format. Thirty-nine residents estimated that they had referred an average of 1.5 patients to a speech-language pathologist and 2.2 patients to an audiologist during a six-month interval. The findings indicated that these residents did not routinely refer patients to speech-language pathologists. When they did refer, a limited view of communication problems was used. 
Endoscopic palliative management of rectal cancer. Laser ablation and bipolar coagulation have been used to palliate rectal cancer and avoid surgery. Indications are distal metastatic disease, extensive local invasion, obstruction and bleeding from nonresectable rectal tumor, or refusal of surgery. From Jan 1, 1986, to Jan 1, 1989, I saw 26 patients who met those criteria; 19 already had metastatic disease and three repeatedly refused abdominoperineal resection. A two-laser approach using both CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers was used in patients with low-lying lesions; others were treated by the Nd:YAG laser only. For rectal tumors, bipolar esophageal tumor probes were used via the rigid sigmoidoscope. The number of laser sessions averaged three per patient, and the number of bipolar coagulation sessions averaged five per patient. Bleeding followed bipolar coagulation in one patient. There were no perforations in either treatment group, and no patient has required colostomy. Of the 19 patients who already had metastatic disease, 12 are still alive, the longest survival being 20 months. Of those medically unfit for surgery, three have died of coincidental disease, and one is alive with controlled rectal cancer after 16 months. All three patients who refused surgery are alive; the longest survival is 13 months. 
Nutritional support in liver failure. The most important manifestations of advanced liver disease are malnutrition, encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome. Appropriate and optimal nutritional and metabolic support with specially formulated solutions enriched in branched-chain amino acids, together with other advanced treatments such as plasmapheresis, hemofiltration, and continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis, can correct the most important metabolic and clinical aberrations and temporarily improve the quality of life. However, the ultimately poor prognosis of patients with severe liver failure has not been altered significantly to date by the provision of nonspecific or specifically tailored nutrient regimens. The prognosis appears to depend on the arrest, correction, or reversal of the primary pathophysiologic process. 
The concept of silent otitis media. Its importance and implications. This article defines silent otitis media and describes its continuum of signs and symptoms and its sequelae. Chronic silent otitis media and silent otitis media in children are also examined, and treatment principles are provided. 
Endoscopic injection sclerosis: effective treatment for bleeding peptic ulcer. One hundred and nine patients presenting with severe haemorrhage from benign peptic ulcers were randomised to either endoscopic injection sclerotherapy using a combination of 1:100,000 adrenaline and 5% ethanolamine or to conservative treatment. Only high risk patients with active bleeding or endoscopic stigmata of recent haemorrhage and accessible ulcers were considered. The two groups were well matched for age, shock, haemoglobin concentration, endoscopic findings, and consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The group treated endoscopically had a significantly reduced rebleeding rate (12.5% v 47%, p less than 0.001). Rebleeding was successfully treated in some patients by injection sclerotherapy, other patients underwent urgent surgery. While there was a tendency towards a lower operation rate and lower transfusion requirements in the treated group, this failed to achieve statistical significance. The use of injection sclerotherapy in the conservatively treated group after rebleeding undoubtedly reduced the number of surgical operations. Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy is effective in the prevention of rebleeding in these patients. 
Recurrent and de novo renal disease after kidney transplantation with or without cyclosporine A. We evaluated the clinical course of 700 renal transplantations, including 1,305 transplant histologies performed in 611 patients between 1970 and 1988, to estimate the influence of cyclosporine A (CsA) after kidney transplantation on the incidence of recurrent or de novo renal disease. Primary renal disease recurred in 11 of 583 functioning transplants (1.9%) with transplant loss in seven patients (1.2%): focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS, three patients); membranous glomerulonephritis (GN, one patient); mesangiocapillary GN (one patient); rapidly progressive IgA nephropathy (one patient); hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS, three patients); and oxalosis in two transplants (one patient). De novo renal disease occurred in six patients (1.0%), including mesangiocapillary GN type I (three patients); nonpurulent focal GN in septicemia (one patient); HUS (one patient); and nodular glomerulosclerosis in steroid diabetes (one patient). De novo membranous GN was seen in 14 additional cases (2.4%). No statistically significant difference could be established between the treatment groups without (n = 225) and with (n = 358) CsA in recurrent and de novo renal disease (n = 7/225 v 10/358, NS); in recurrent and de novo GN (n = 4/225 v 6/358, NS); in recurrent FSGS (n = 1/7 v 2/8, NS); in recurrent and de novo HUS (n - 1/1 v 2/7, NS); and in de novo membranous GN (n = 7/225 v 7/358, NS). Transplant loss by recurrent and de novo GN was higher without than with CsA (n = 4/4 v 1/6, P = 0.004). On the basis of our investigation, we conclude that recurrent and de novo renal disease in the transplant occur rarely and are not prevented by CsA. However, even if the incidence of transplant GN is unchanged by CsA treatment, its clinical course seems to be mitigated. CsA treatment also does not increase the incidence of HUS. 
Dendritic hypertrophy in Purkinje neurons of old Fischer 344 rats after long-term ethanol treatment. Metric parameters of Purkinje cell dendritic networks in 24- to 26-month-old Fischer 344 rats were determined after 48 weeks of chronic ethanol intake. Measurements included the total number and length of all segments/network, the total number and length of segments within topologically defined segment categories, and the mean length of segments in each category. A main effect of ethanol was expressed as a significant increase in cumulative length within one category of terminal segments. This increase was the result of a significant increase in mean length/segment in that category. Metric changes in other segment categories were not significant, showing that changes in the networks during ethanol treatment were not distributed randomly. Recovery after ethanol treatment was associated with further nonrandom remodeling of these networks. Significant differences in lengths of terminal segments were no longer present, but internal segments in networks of both pair-fed and ethanol-fed rats were significantly longer. Only one category of internal segments showed this change during recovery. The data showed that long term ethanol treatment in old rats, at a time when effects of aging processes were prominent in Purkinje cell networks, was associated with remodeling of those networks through dendritic extension. This effect was interpreted as compensatory growth in surviving networks following ethanol-related neuronal loss and/or damage to the surrounding neuropil. Recovery from dietary treatment produced further internal remodeling of those networks that was not related specifically to ethanol. It could be shown, however, that the restructuring processes that resulted in longer internal segments after dietary recovery were different in the pair-fed and the ethanolfed rats. 
Aural rehabilitation. Aural rehabilitation involves a complete evaluation of the communication deficits and needs of the hearing-impaired patient as well as the provision of counselling and therapy. This article describes listening-assistive devices, speech production, and audiovisual training. Issues related to educational placement and tinnitus also are reviewed. 
Cation-induced restoration of insulin action in insulin-desensitized HTC cells. Insulin desensitization of amino acid uptake in HTC cells was induced by preincubation with 4 or 10 micrograms/ml insulin. Insulin binding after desensitisation was decreased by both insulin concentrations due to a 45-49% decrease in insulin receptor numbers. Desensitization with 4 micrograms/ml insulin increased the ED50 for half-maximal stimulation of amino acid uptake from 19.5 +/- 9.2 ng/ml in control cells to 84.0 +/- 8.3 ng/ml (P less than 0.0001). It also decreased the maximal insulin response of amino acid uptake from 1.40 +/- 0.10 to 1.14 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg protein, indicating the production of a mild postreceptor defect. Desensitization with 10 micrograms/ml insulin completely abolished this insulin response. When cellular receptors were down-regulated with 4 micrograms/ml insulin and restimulated with insulin in the presence of 0.03 mM ruthenium red (RR) or 10 mM Ca2+, both the insulin response and insulin binding were increased. Insulin binding was restored to levels comparable to those observed in control cells by an increase in receptor affinity. The ED50 of amino acid uptake decreased to 20.5 +/- 7.3 ng/ml insulin in the presence of RR and to 42.2 +/- 8.9 ng/ml in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+ (both P less than 0.0001 from down-regulated cells). In addition, the maximal insulin response increased from 1.14 +/- 0.10 to 1.40 +/- 0.10 and 1.45 +/- 0.10 nmol/mg protein, respectively. Preincubation with 10 micrograms/ml insulin prevented the effect of RR and Ca2+ on the recovery of insulin responses. These experiments suggest that insulin-desensitized cells undergo a progressive loss of their insulin response and that RR and Ca2+ provide useful reagents to investigate the mechanisms of this process because they can counteract the decrease in insulin response by increasing receptor affinity and receptor-effector coupling. 
Esophageal tuberculosis: a rare presentation with hematemesis. Esophageal tuberculosis is rare, with only 26 cases previously reported in the literature. Patients usually present with progressive dysphagia or odynophagia. We report a patient with hematemesis that was later attributed to the erosion of tuberculous subcarinal lymph nodes into the esophagus. This presentation has been described in only two other patients, both of whom died of exsanguinating hemorrhage. The successful outcome in the present case rested on the availability of rapid diagnostic modalities and timely surgical intervention. 
Combined intertrochanteric and Chiari pelvic osteotomies for hip dysplasia. Thirty-two dysplastic hips with secondary osteoarthritis, in 28 patients aged 18 to 42 years, were treated by combined intertrochanteric and Chiari osteotomy. They were followed up for 2.5 to 10 years. Pain was the main presenting symptom in all the patients. The indication for surgery was based on the severity of disease with respect to congruency, secondary degenerative change and degree of dysplasia. The average pre-operative Harris hip score was 47.7 and the majority had severe dysplasia with degenerative changes. On final review the average score was 88. The radiographic appearances of degenerative arthritis regressed in 72% of hips and dysplasia was improved in all cases. The results of this conservative form of surgery are better in hips with less severe dysplasia and mild secondary degenerative change. 
Low-dose aspirin therapy for chronic stable angina. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, trial. PATIENTS: The study included 333 men with baseline chronic stable angina but with no previous history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack who were enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study, a trial of aspirin among 22,071 male physicians. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive alternate-day aspirin therapy (325 mg) or placebo and were followed for an average of 60.2 months for the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: During follow-up, 27 patients had confirmed myocardial infarctions; 7 were among the 178 patients with chronic stable angina who received aspirin therapy and 20 were among the 155 patients who received placebo (relative risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.63; P = 0.003). While simultaneously controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in a proportional hazards model, an overall 87% risk reduction was calculated (relative risk, 0.13; CI, 0.04 to 0.42; P less than 0.001). For the subgroup of patients with chronic stable angina but no previous coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty, an almost identical reduction in the risk for myocardial infarction was found (relative risk, 0.14; CI, 0.04 to 0.56; P = 0.006). Of 13 strokes, 11 occurred in the aspirin group and 2 in the placebo group (relative risk, 5.4; CI, 1.3 to 22.1; P = 0.02). No stroke was fatal, but 4 produced some long-term impairment of function. One stroke, in the aspirin group, was hemorrhagic. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that alternate-day aspirin therapy greatly reduced the risk for first myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina, a group of patients at high risk for cardiovascular death (P less than 0.001). Although our results for stroke were based on small numbers, they suggested an apparent increase in frequency of stroke with aspirin therapy; this finding requires confirmation in randomized trials of adequate sample size. 
Cytologic detection of colorectal cancer after administration of oral lavage solution. Whether malignant cells can be detected in the bowel movements induced by oral gut lavage solution administration was studied in patients with known colonic adenocarcinomas. The induced bowel movements were collected in 27 patients, nine of whom had cancer proven by anatomic pathologic examination. The cells present were recovered with a simple technique and stained by the Papanicolaou method. Malignant cells were identified in the stained preparations in all nine patients with cancer (100% sensitivity), and there were few false positives (94.5% specificity). The authors concluded that if additional studies with greater numbers of subjects confirm the reliability of this technique, a test may be developed that would be useful for either early detection or screening. 
Critically ischemic myocardium in clinically stable patients following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction: potential implications for early coronary angioplasty in selected patients. The utility of post-thrombolysis, rest-redistribution thallium (TI)-201 scintigraphy was studied in 32 patients with a first myocardial infarction who were clinically stable following reperfusion. Day 1 scintigraphy obtained 5 +/- 4 hours (range 1 to 16) after thrombolysis revealed an average perfusion defect of 6.5 +/- 2.6 segments (range 1 to 11). There was a total of 208 abnormal segments, 137 of which were nonreversible at 4 hours, 50 of which were fully or partially reversible, and 21 of which had a reverse redistribution pattern. Repeat TI-201 scintigraphy on day 10 revealed significantly smaller perfusion defects of 4.9 +/- 2.4 segments (range 0 to 9) with improvement predominantly of the day 1 reversible segments, and the improvement in segmental perfusion correlated with better regional left ventricular function. Twenty-nine (58%) of the 50 reversible segments normalized by day 10, and 11 (22%) improved, whereas only 16 (12%) of 137 nonreversible segments had normalized by day 10, only 9 had (6%) improved and 112 (82%) were unchanged (p less than 0.001 reversible versus nonreversible). There was no significant change in segments with a pattern of reverse redistribution. The improvement of reversible segments was greater in the 16 patients who underwent coronary angioplasty (PTCA) during the interval between the two scintigrams than in the 16 who did not. All 24 reversible segments in the PTCA group improved or normalized by day 10 compared with 16 (62%) of 26 reversible segments in the No PTCA group (p less than 0.001). Furthermore, 8 of the 10 reversible segments in the No PTCA group that did not improve actually deteriorated and became nonreversible by day 10. The minor improvement of nonreversible segments was not related to PTCA. Consistent with the findings in individual segments, the 19 patients with a reversible component on the day 1 TI-201 scintigram had significantly greater improvement in perfusion defect by day 10 than the 13 patients without a reversible component (37 +/- 33% versus 7 +/- 22% decrease in perfusion defect severity, p less than 0.05), and this improvement was greatest in the 10 patients with a reversible component who underwent PTCA. In contrast, PTCA had no impact on the perfusion defect in the 13 patients without a reversible component. Our data suggest that following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, viable myocardium in the reperfused zone may remain ischemic, as manifested by a reversible pattern of TI-201 redistribution at rest, and thus may be in jeopardy of gradual progression to necrosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The role of platelets, thrombin and hyperplasia in restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Coronary angioplasty has become a successful and widely used treatment for patients with coronary artery disease since its first clinical application in 1977. The primary success rate has improved despite the increase in procedure and case complexity. However, acute reocclusion and late restenosis, which constitute the most important problems after successful angioplasty, continue to occur in about 5% and 35% of patients within 3 to 6 months, respectively. Angioscopic and pathologic observations have suggested that a multifactorial pathophysiologic process accounts for acute reocclusion, involving marked thrombosis, intimal dissection, medial and subintimal hemorrhage, vascular recoil and vasocontriction. In contrast, chronic restenosis involves the development of fibrocellular intimal hyperplasia within a milieu created by vascular injury, platelet activation, thrombin generation and the release of mitogens. Although current pharmacologic approaches, which involve antithrombotic and anticoagulant therapy, have been largely ineffective in eliminating acute reocclusion and chronic restenosis, recent advances in the research in thrombosis, platelet receptors and smooth muscle growth regulation have allowed new therapeutic options to be tested in the experimental setting, with subsequent potential clinical applications in patients. 
Paramedics: knowledge base and attitudes towards AIDS and hepatitis. We surveyed 420 paramedics employed by a large metropolitan fire department to determine the effects of educational seminars on their knowledge base, perceptions, and attitudes about AIDS and hepatitis B. All surveys were completed on an anonymous, voluntary, and confidential basis. Our educational efforts improved the paramedics' knowledge base concerning the medical manifestations of AIDS, identification of risk factors, modes of transmission, and means of infection control, but had no impact on paramedics' fear of contracting AIDS. While paramedics have a strong fear of contracting AIDS, we note that they underestimate their risk of acquiring hepatitis B. Only 17% of paramedics surveyed had received the hepatitis vaccine, despite attending an infectious disease seminar addressing the occupational risks of acquiring hepatitis B infections during the previous year. Further educational efforts to address the paramedics' attitudes about AIDS, as well as to encourage paramedics to recognize hepatitis B exposure as a significant personal health risk, are currently being pursued. 
The role of the pathologist in the management of breast cancer. The pathologist is a consultant in breast cancer management whose responsibility is to establish the histologic diagnosis of cancer as well as its anatomic extent once sufficient tissue has been provided. The consultation also provides data that may be used to aid in selecting primary or adjuvant therapy, evaluating new therapies, estimating prognosis, and assessing outcome. Examples of such data are the TNM histopathologic classification of the anatomic extent of the cancer used for the stage grouping (T = the extent of the primary tumor, N = the absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node metastasis, and M = the absence or presence of distant metastasis); tumor size, histologic type, and histologic and/or nuclear grade; assessment of blood vessel and lymphatic vessel invasion; analysis of steroid receptors, and other special studies as appropriate. 
Prominent meningeal "tail sign" in a patient with a metastatic tumor. A prominent enhancement of the dura adjacent to meningiomas has been described as being pathognomonic of these tumors. We describe a case where a classic meningeal "tail sign" was associated with an extra-axial metastatic tumor attached to the tentorium. There was no tumor invasion of the dura. We conclude that this sign is nonspecific and can be seen with dural-based tumors other than meningiomas. 
Recurrent haemospermia--underlying urogenital anomalies and efficacy of imaging procedures. Recurrent haemospermia is often regarded as "essential". Following routine diagnostic procedures, we found an associated factor in 54 of 72 patients (75%). With one exception (prostatic carcinoma), the benign character of the disease was confirmed. Urogenital infection was the most frequent concomitant finding (50%); in 26 men chronic prostatis was diagnosed. Other disorders such as hypertension and coagulation disorders played a minor role. Additional investigation of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles by transrectal prostatic ultrasonography revealed persistent asymmetry of the latter glands as the main finding in 20 men (28%). In every case seminal vesicle carcinoma was excluded; haemorrhage due to cystic distension, inflammatory lesions or ductal obstruction was associated in all cases with congenital abnormalities, chronic urogenital infection, coagulation disorders or hypertension. 
Obstructive dilatation of extrahepatic recipient and donor bile ducts complicating orthotopic liver transplantation: imaging and laboratory findings. Biliary obstruction in liver transplants is most commonly due to stricture at the biliary anastomosis. The native common bile duct typically is normal. We retrospectively studied 28 patients with choledochocholedochostomy anastomoses who had marked native and donor extrahepatic bile duct dilatation associated with clinical evidence of biliary obstruction. Operative cholangiograms were compared with postoperative cholangiograms obtained a mean of 50 weeks (range, 2-246 weeks) later. Mean caliber of the native common bile duct increased from 7.5 +/- 2.0 mm on operative cholangiograms to 14.8 +/- 3.9 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Mean caliber of the donor common hepatic duct increased from 5.9 +/- 1.3 mm on operative cholangiograms to 12.8 +/- 3.8 mm on postoperative cholangiograms (p less than .001). Dilatation of the cystic duct remnant was seen in 15 patients. All patients had surgical revision to choledochojejunostomy with improved results of liver function studies in most cases. Diffuse dilatation of native and donor extrahepatic bile ducts may develop in liver transplant recipients. Typical features include native and donor extrahepatic ducts greater than 12 mm in diameter and a dilated cystic duct remnant on postoperative cholangiography in a patient with otherwise unexplained hepatic dysfunction. 
Regional cerebral blood flow in developmental stutterers. Stuttering is a poorly understood communication disorder with a 1% global prevalence. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in a neurogenic origin for the disorder, although no research has established clear neurological differences between "developmental" (stuttering onset in childhood) stutterers and nonstutterers. We have used xenon 133 single-photon emission computed tomography to study regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in 20 stutterers. Analysis revealed global, absolute flow reductions. Relative flow asymmetries (left less than right) were identified in three hemispheric regions: anterior cingulate and superior and middle temporal gyri. Milder changes were found in the left inferior frontal gyrus. Stutterers had rCBF values below median for either anterior cingulate or middle temporal gyri. With one exception, severe stutterers had rCBF values below median for the anterior cingulate gyrus. All stutterers with rCBF values above median in the cingulate gyrus had rCBF values below median in the middle temporal gyrus, and severity of their disorder was either mild or moderate. Our findings suggest that stuttering is a neurogenic disorder involving recognized cortical regions of speech-motor control. 
What if Americans ate less fat? A quantitative estimate of the effect on mortality. Americans consume an average of 37% of their energy intake as fat. Many authorities recommend restricting fat intake to 30% of energy intake to reduce the rates of coronary heart disease and perhaps of cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate. Based on the assumptions that underlie those recommendations, we estimated the effect of this dietary change on mortality. If all Americans restricted their intake of dietary fat by reducing consumption of saturated fat and accompanying dietary cholesterol, the corresponding reductions in serum cholesterol levels could reduce coronary heart disease mortality rates by 5% to 20%, depending on age. If the relationship between dietary fat and cancer is as strong as has been observed in some studies, the proportional effects on mortality from fat-related cancers could be even greater, although the absolute effects--given the lower mortality rates--would be smaller. Overall, if the assumptions are correct, about 42,000 of the 2.3 million deaths that would have occurred in adults each year in the United States could be deferred. This 2% benefit, equivalent to an increase in average life expectancy of 3 to 4 months, would accrue chiefly to people over the age of 65 years. If recent concerns about the possibly harmful effects of cholesterol lowering on mortality from noncardiovascular causes--which mainly affect younger persons--are valid, these relatively modest benefits would be overestimates of the actual effect. 
Stimulation of pancreas and gastric carcinoma cell growth by interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Hematopoietic growth factors have recently been well characterized by complementary DNA cloning. For human epidermal growth factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor recombinant proteins have been expressed in Escherichia coli. To reduce the toxic side effects of chemotherapy on the bone marrow, recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant human interleukin 3 were applied to patients suffering of gastrointestinal cancers. To determine the influence of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and recombinant human interleukin 3 on human pancreas and gastric cancer cell cells in vitro, a sensitive microculture test system was established that allows precise quantification of proliferation. A more than twofold enhancement of proliferation was observed by interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in two of two cell cultures derived from gastric carcinoma cells, while two of nine cultures from pancreas carcinoma cells have shown enhanced cell growth in the presence of recombinant human interleukin 3 or recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. In comparison, recombinant human epidermal growth factor increased cell growth in two of two gastric and in five of nine pancreas carcinoma cultures. In general, 1-10 ng/mL of the growth factors yielded the highest growth rate, but even 1-pg amounts produced increased cell growth. Expression of messenger RNA for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin 3, and the oncogene HER2/neu remained undetectable in all of the tested cell lines, while the various abundance of messenger RNA for the epidermal growth factor receptor was different in each cell line. The reported results imply that the hematopoietic growth factors interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor influence cellular growth of pancreas and gastric carcinoma cells by a paracrine mechanism and may possess a more general regulatory function than originally anticipated. 
Squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea. We treated two patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea without involvement of the corneoscleral limbus. Superficial keratectomy and cryotherapy in one patient and penetrating keratoplasty in the other patient resulted in no recurrence of the tumor after 46 and nine months, respectively. Actinic damage and late manifestation caused by poor vision in both eyes of both patients may have been the risk factors for development of this tumor. 
Intraocular pressure-dependent retinal vascular change in adult chronic open-angle glaucoma patients. Intraocular pressure (IOP)-dependent retinal vascular changes were investigated in 33 eyes of 33 adult chronic open-angle glaucoma (COAG) patients by measuring major retinal vascular calibers at the optic disc border before and after mean (+/- standard deviation) IOP reduction from 35.3 (+/- 7.2) to 16.5 (+/- 4.7) mmHg for 11.2 (+/- 13.5) weeks. Both mean arterial and venous calibers were significantly reduced (P less than 0.0001 for each), from 87.8 (+/- 14.2) and 128.3 (+/- 20.8) microns at high IOP to 82.0 (+/- 13.8) and 121.4 (+/- 18.5) microns at low IOP. Arterial and venous caliber decreases correlated positively with magnitude of IOP reduction (r = 0.503, P less than 0.01 and r = 0.555, P less than 0.001, respectively). While the IOP-dependent retinal arterial caliber change was highly significant in patients 55 years of age or younger (r = 0.636, P less than 0.01) and in the overall study group, it was not significant in patients older than 55 years (r = 0.205, P greater than 0.1). Age seems to be more influential than magnitude of IOP reduction in patients older than 55. Thus, diminished IOP-dependent retinal arterial caliber change in the elderly may be one factor contributing to the higher incidence and prevalence of glaucoma in this population. 
Disturbed secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with persistent atrial standstill: endocrinologic silence. Persistent atrial standstill is a very rare pathophysiologic condition whose diagnosis is established when both electrical and mechanical silence of the atria are confirmed. To test the hypothesis that secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide is disturbed in patients with persistent atrial standstill, the response of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and other neurohormonal factors during exercise was investigated in three patients with a rate-responsive ventricular demand (VVI) pacemaker implanted for confirmed persistent atrial standstill. The results were compared with those observed in eight normal subjects and patients with a rate-responsive VVI (Group A) or atrial demand (AAI) (Group B) pacemaker implanted for confirmed sick sinus syndrome. Patients in Group A displayed significant elevation of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide secretion both before and during exercise (122.5 +/- 14.8 and 207.5 +/- 8.3 pg/ml, respectively) compared with those in Group B (55 +/- 14.1 and 116.4 +/- 51.5 pg/ml, respectively) and the normal subjects (18.9 +/- 9.8 and 30.8 +/- 19.2 pg/ml, respectively). This indicated development of a nonphysiologic increase in atrial volume or pressure overload, or both, in rate-responsive VVI pacing because of lack of atrioventricular synchrony. However, patients with persistent atrial standstill had undetectable (less than 10 pg/ml) or almost undetectable secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide as well as lower levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the circulation both before and during exercise. Changes in plasma catecholamines during exercise were similar in patients with persistent atrial standstill compared with the other groups. This study indicates that "endocrinologic silence" accompanies electrical and mechanical silence of the atria, which may constitute a third diagnostic clue to persistent atrial standstill. 
Do Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease patients of Jewish Libyan origin have unique clinical features? A focus of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is present in Israel among Jews born in Libya. The present study examines the clinical features in this particular group of patients. In a country-wide study of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, we identified 114 patients; 49 were Libyan immigrants, and 65 (three of whom had Libyan ancestors) were born in other countries. The clinical presentation and evolution of the disease is very similar in patients born in Libya and others without Libyan ancestors, but it tends to be more classical in the Libyan patients, with higher frequency of myoclonic jerks and periodic EEG and a progressive course of shorter duration. The Libyan patients tend to complain more often of headache, which is most probably an ethnic expression for depression and loss of concentration. There was no difference between the familial and nonfamilial cases. 
Diagnosis and treatment of cluster headache. This article classifies cluster headaches as distinct from other types of headaches and gives guidelines for diagnosis and treatment. Explanations of the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of cluster headaches are included also. 
Nosocomial pneumonia and the role of gastric pH. A meta-analysis. PURPOSE: To examine the differential effect of drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis on nosocomial pneumonia in critically ill patients. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Computerized bibliographic search of published and unpublished research. STUDY SELECTION: Independent review of 48 randomized controlled trials of prophylaxis identified eight relevant studies. DATA ABSTRACTION: The population, intervention, and outcomes were evaluated by duplicate independent review. RESULTS: The incidence of pneumonia was lower in critically ill patients receiving antacids and/or histamine-2-receptor antagonists as compared with patients receiving no stress ulcer prophylaxis (common odds ratio 0.42, 95 percent CI 0.17 to 1.11). When stress ulcer prophylactic therapy was titrated to achieve a gastric pH of 3.5 or greater, there was a trend favoring a decreased incidence of pneumonia (0.66, 95 percent CI 0.24 to 1.78). In trials comparing sucralfate with pH-altering drugs, the common odds ratio of 0.55 (0.28 to 1.06) suggests a 45 percent risk reduction with the use of sucralfate. CONCLUSION: Stress ulcer prophylaxis with drugs which raise gastric pH does not increase the incidence of pneumonia in comparison to placebo or control therapy. The use of sucralfate is associated with a lower incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in comparison to agents which raise gastric pH. However, methodologic deficiencies, small sample sizes, and the failure to examine the effects of antacids and histamine-2-receptor antagonists separately make a large prospective randomized trial necessary to confirm or refute these findings. 
Pharmacokinetic analysis of coronary venous retroinfusion: a comparison with anterograde coronary artery drug administration using metoprolol as a tracer. Plasma and myocardial tissue concentrations of metoprolol were studied in ischemic and nonischemic areas of 22 pigs after 90 (n = 19) and 16 (n = 3) min of left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion. Group A (n = 6) received simultaneous intravenous metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg body weight) and tritium-labeled (3H)-metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) retrogradely into the coronary vein. In group B (n = 5), metoprolol and 3H-metoprolol were administered in the same way, but at half the volume to study the influence of derived coronary venous pressure on the myocardial concentration of drug. In group C (n = 3), metoprolol was given retrogradely and saline solution was infused into the left anterior descending artery before induced death to wash out metoprolol from the coronary veins. To rule out a possible influence of the development of myocardial necrosis on drug distribution, metoprolol was retroinfused after 1 min of arterial occlusion in three pigs (group D). In group E (n = 5), metoprolol (0.2 mg/kg) was infused anterogradely into the left anterior descending artery. Peak plasma concentration was significantly higher after intravenous infusion of metoprolol (1,188 +/- 503 nmol/liter) than after coronary venous infusion (417 +/- 155 nmol/liter; p less than 0.001). In groups A and B, the nonischemic myocardial concentration of metoprolol was 250 to 300 pmol/g, whether the drug was infused intravenously or into the coronary vein. Coronary venous retroinfusion, however, resulted in a substantial accumulation of metoprolol in the ischemic myocardium. In group A pigs, subendocardial myocardial concentration was 16,800 +/- 7,774, mid-myocardial 39,590 +/- 18,043 and subepicardial 57,143 +/- 29,030 pmol/g (mean +/- SE). The ischemic myocardial concentration in pigs from group B was somewhat less pronounced, probably secondary to a lower coronary venous pressure (15 +/- 3 mm Hg) with the lower volume of infusion (6.1 +/- 0.3 ml) in group B compared with 32 +/- 5 mm Hg with a 14 +/- 1 ml infusion in group A. Coronary artery anterograde administration resulted in myocardial ischemic and nonischemic zone drug concentrations similar to those observed after retroinfusion into the coronary vein. With both modes of administration, there was a transmyocardial gradient from a somewhat lower drug concentration in the subendocardium, toward an increasing level in the mid-myocardium, to the highest concentration in the subepicardial zone of the ischemic myocardium. Coronary venous retroinfusion resulted in pronounced drug accumulation in the ischemic myocardium. The derived coronary venous pressure during infusion influenced the concentration of drug.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Endocrine manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Endocrine manifestations of HIV infection include both pathological changes and disturbances in function. Mechanisms include direct infection of glands by HIV or opportunistic organisms, infiltration by neoplasms, side effects of drugs, and production of humoral factors that may alter metabolism. The adrenal gland is most often affected, but virtually every endocrine system may be involved. Dysfunction is often subtle, with symptoms overlapping those of the HIV infection itself. Endocrine manifestations may be found at any time in the course of the disease, from the asymptomatic HIV-positive stage through full-blown AIDS. Optimal management of these patients may include a careful search for, and appropriate treatment of, associated endocrine abnormalities. 
Uncemented total hip arthroplasty. Prospective analysis of the tri-lock femoral component. Fifty consecutive hip disease patients (56 hips) with total hip arthroplasties (THA) utilized the uncemented Tri-Lock femoral component. Forty-five patients (51 hips) were followed for an average of 46 months (range, 24-66). Forty-two patients (47 hips) were followed with clinical examination and roentgenographs, three (four hips) by telephone interview, four (four hips) were deceased, and one (one hip) was lost to follow-up evaluation. The diagnoses included osteoarthritis (30 hips), avascular necrosis (11 hips), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (two hips), and degenerative joint disease secondary to childhood hip disorder (four hips). Of 47 hips, 34 were graded excellent, seven good, three fair, and three poor using the Harris hip score. The incidence of thigh pain was 19% at one year, but only 6% at final follow-up evaluation. Limp persisted in 19% of the patients. Of the three patients with four hips contacted by telephone, two had slight pain and two had no pain. The roentgenographic results found an alarming 38% incidence of varus shift of the components, relative to their preoperative position. The presence of a varus shift did not adversely affect the clinical results. Early experience with the Tri-Lock femoral component shows results comparable to those reported in the literature. The high incidence of femoral component shift, presumably because of geometry of the stem is of concern. Longer follow-up evaluation will be necessary to determine the fate of these uncemented THA operations. 
Gastric cancer after gastric bypass for obesity. Case report. We describe a patient in whom gastric cancer developed after gastric bypass for morbid obesity. In addition, we review the literature to emphasize the technical problems involved in diagnosing disease in the excluded portion of the stomach. 
A newly developed drug delivery system using fine particles of activated charcoal for targeting chemotherapy. Targeting chemotherapy to the metastatic lesions of the lymph nodes after surgical removal of the main tumor, a drug delivery system using ultrafine particles of activated charcoal was developed and examined for its ability to adsorb mitomycin C (MMC) and to transport MMC to the lymph system. Satisfactory results were obtained. In animal experiments, serial sampling of thoracic duct lymph by cannulation and serial samplings of peripheral vein blood after injection of MMC-charcoal solution into the subserosal space of the intestinal wall were made to study the pharmacodynamics of the lymph-blood system through analysis of MMC regression curves. Clearance (K) and half-life (t1/2) are calculated from the formula; C(t) = C(t0) X e-kt, and compared with that of MMC-saline. Activated charcoal has a proven ability to transport MMC to the lymphatic system. With activated charcoal, MMC is retained for much longer in the lymph nodes than with saline. Congestion of the lymph system was produced by ligation of the thoracic duct in CH-40, with 25% prolongation of t1/2. In conclusion, these drug delivery systems are suitable for targeting chemotherapy at lymph node metastases, and it is proven that 1500 AA Mitsubishi ultrafine charcoal is a good carrier of drug and a slow drug-release material in the lymphatics. Minimal side effects are expected because of the constant low concentrations in the general circulation. 
Efficacy of ICS 205-930, a novel 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, in the prevention of migraine attacks. A complex answer to a simple question. ICS 205-930 Migraine Study Group. To investigate whether the novel, potent and highly selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist ICS 205-930 can prevent migraine attacks, we conducted simultaneously two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, international trials, involving a total of 204 patients, suffering from classic or common migraine. Both trials had the same parallel-group design (1 month baseline observation, followed by 3 months treatment) and both produced remarkably similar results. The primary efficacy parameter was the proportional reduction in attack frequency recorded after 3 months of treatment. Twenty-two patients withdrew prematurely from the trials and could not be assessed for efficacy. Mild to severe constipation was reported by about 50% of the patients on active treatment. None of the doses of ICS 205-930 tested (50 mg, 25 mg and 15 mg daily) produced a statistically significantly better result to reduce attack frequency than did placebo. However, confidence intervals for the difference in effect with placebo were wide, indicating that 15 mg ICS 205-930 may produce a 57% reduction in attack frequency as compared to placebo. The most unusual finding was that, for all efficacy parameters, the best results were obtained with the lowest dose (15 mg), the worst results with the highest dose (50 mg) and an intermediate effect with 25 mg. Such an inverse relation between dose and efficacy suggests a bell-shaped dose-response curve, implying that doses lower than 15 mg might well prove to be more effective. Thus, the present study has produced inconclusive, but intriguing results. Lower doses should be further investigated before drawing any definite conclusion on the efficacy of ICS 205-930 in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. 
Long-term followup results after expectant management of stage A1 prostatic cancer. A total of 132 patients with stage A1 adenocarcinoma of the prostate was followed for 5 to 23 years (mean 8.2 years). Of these patients 52 underwent a second staging transurethral resection of the prostate between 1977 and 1986. Progressive disease developed in 3 of the 12 patients (25%) in whom residual foci of well differentiated cancer were detected by the second transurethral resection and who did not undergo further treatment. Of the 38 patients in whom the second transurethral resection did not detect residual cancer 3 (8%) also had progressive disease. From April 1989 to December 1989, 44 patients were re-evaluated by transrectal ultrasonography and ultrasonographically guided biopsies. Of these patients 3 had locally progressive disease. Progressive disease also developed in 4 more patients. Thus, 13 of the 132 patients (10%) had either locally or systemically progressive disease after long-term followup. The interval from diagnosis of stage A1 disease to detection of progression ranged from 6 months to 20 years (mean 7 years). Ten patients underwent definitive treatment for what was believed to be locally progressive disease, 2 underwent palliative therapy and 1 had no therapy due to poor physical condition. Of the 10 patients who underwent definitive therapy 6 are alive without evidence of disease, 2 died of unrelated causes without evidence of disease and 2 are alive with stage D1 disease. These data suggest that patients in whom a second staging transurethral resection of the prostate detects residual cancer have a high probability of progressive disease. Also, negative findings from a second staging transurethral resection may not exclude the possibility of disease progression. Expectant management of stage A1 disease is warranted but regular and long-term followup is mandatory. 
The syndrome of alcoholic ketoacidosis. PURPOSE: To further elucidate the clinical spectrum of alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A case series of 74 patients with AKA defined as a wide anion gap metabolic acidosis unexplained by any other disorder or toxin, including any patient with a history of chronic alcohol abuse. The setting was the Medical Emergency Department at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, a university-affiliated inner-city hospital. RESULTS: AKA is a common disorder in the emergency department, more common than previously thought. The acid-base abnormalities are more diverse than just a wide-gap metabolic acidosis and often include a concomitant metabolic alkalosis, hyperchloremic acidosis, or respiratory alkalosis. Lactic acidosis is also common. Semiquantitative serum acetoacetate levels were positive in 96% of patients. Elevated blood alcohol levels were present in two thirds of patients in whom alcohol levels were determined, and levels consistent with intoxication were seen in 40% of these patients. Electrolyte disorders including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, hyperglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hypomagnesemia were common on presentation. The most common symptoms were nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The most common physical findings were tachycardia, tachypnea, and abdominal tenderness. Altered mental status, fever, hypothermia, or other abnormal findings were uncommon and reflected other underlying processes. CONCLUSIONS: AKA is a common disorder in chronic malnourished alcoholic persons. The acid-base abnormalities reflect not only the ketoacidosis, but also associated extracellular fluid volume depletion, alcohol withdrawal, pain, sepsis, or severe liver disease. Although the pathophysiology is complex, the syndrome is rapidly reversible and has a low mortality. 
Distribution of the VLA family of integrins in normal and pathological human liver tissue. The "very late activation" (VLA) subgroup of the integrin superfamily of adhesion molecules plays a central role in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. The six different VLA dimers known so far consist of a common beta subunit and a variable alpha (1 to 6) subunit. They serve as receptors for laminin, collagen, and fibronectin or function as adhesion molecules for leukocytes and are therefore of great significance in embryogenesis, growth and repair, and in leukocyte recirculation. The distribution of the common beta and the variable alpha chains of the VLA were studied in normal, inflammatory, and cholestatic liver biopsy samples. In normal liver tissue, vascular endothelia express alpha 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6; bile duct epithelium alpha 2, 3, 5, and 6; connective tissue stroma alpha 1 and 2; hepatocytes alpha 1 and 5; sinusoidal lining cells alpha 1, 2, and 5; and mononuclear cells alpha 4. Whereas bile ducts and vascular endothelia do not show relevant changes in alpha chain expression in liver diseases, hepatocytes de novo express membranous alpha 3 and 6 in inflammatory liver diseases. In view of the role of the VLA-3 and VLA-6 as laminin receptors, this finding is in line with the production of laminin in active liver disease. Moreover, de novo expression of "bile duct type" alpha 2, 3, and 6 on periportal hepatocytes in cholestatic liver disease likely illustrates a phenotypic switch of hepatocytes towards bile duct epithelium during cholestasis. 
Chlamydia trachomatis induces an inflammatory response in the male genital tract and is associated with altered semen quality. U. urealyticum with 15.8% and C. trachomatis antibodies with 15.4% were the most prevalent microbiological findings in 209 male infertility patients. The inflammatory marker granulocyte-elastase was significantly increased in men with C. trachomatis; these men also showed significantly decreased citric acid levels indicating inflammatory damage of the prostate induced by C. trachomatis. 
Amnesia following damage to the left fornix and to other sites. A comparative study. Two memory-impaired patients, who had suffered damage to the left or both fornix columns during removal of a ventricular cyst, were compared with 3 others having left-sided hippocampal or thalamic lesions, and with normal controls. The tests used were nonverbal--scene recognition, delayed matching-to-sample and concurrent pattern and object discrimination learning. The last two are differentially sensitive to fornix transection and to hippocampal or thalamic ablations in monkeys; however, the patients with fornix damage did not show a distinctive pattern of impairment. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The study adds to the evidence that fornix transection can cause wide-ranging memory disturbances in man. 
Extent of mesiobasal resection determines outcome after temporal lobectomy for intractable complex partial seizures. The extent of resection was assessed in 94 patients who underwent temporal lobectomy for medically intractable complex partial seizures originating from a unilateral seizure focus in the anteromesial temporal lobe. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging in the coronal plane was used to quantify the extent of resection of lateral and mesiobasal structures according to a 20-compartment model of the temporal lobe. Successful seizure outcome (greater than or equal to 90% reduction in seizure frequency) was accomplished in 83% of the patients (all followed up for more than 1 year; mean duration of follow-up, 25.2 months) and correlated significantly (P less than 0.05) with the extent of mesiobasal resection, regardless of the extent of resection of lateral structures. Successful seizure outcome was accomplished in 81% of the patients with no structural lesions, and also correlated significantly (P less than 0.05) with the extent of mesiobasal resection regardless of the extent of lateral resection. A successful seizure outcome was accomplished in 90% of the 21 patients with structural lesions documented by neuroimaging studies. Two patients who underwent extensive lobectomy without resection of the structural lesion had no reduction in seizure frequency postoperatively. We conclude that the most important factor in determining the outcome of temporal lobectomy in patients with unilateral anteromesial temporal lobe epileptogenicity is the extent of resection of structures in the mesiobasal temporal lobe. In patients with structural lesions, lesion resection may be an added contributor to successful seizure outcome. 
Preoperative clinical evaluation as a predictor of cardiac complications after infrarenal aortic reconstruction. This paper analyses cardiac risk factors in 93 consecutive patients undergoing elective infrarenal aortic reconstruction over a 2 year period. During the perioperative or postoperative period, 26 patients sustained a total of 42 cardiac complications. Eight patients had myocardial infarction, 14 left ventricular failure and 15 arrhythmias. There were five cardiac-related deaths. Angina was the only statistically significant risk factor in predicting postoperative cardiac problems. A multivariate analysis identified a high-risk group of patients in whom cardiac complications after operation were common. 
Hydroa vacciniforme with unusually severe scar formation: diagnosis by repetitive UVA phototesting. Hydroa vacciniforme is a rare, chronic, photosensitive disorder manifested in childhood by recurrent vesicles that heal with scarring. Reproduction of vesicles with repetitive UVA phototesting may be an important diagnostic aid. Recurrent eruption resulted in severe scarring of the face and a flexion contracture of the finger in our patient. The clinical features and laboratory evaluation of hydroa vacciniforme are reviewed. 
Penetration of erythromycin into periapical lesions after repeated doses of erythromycin acistrate and erythromycin stearate: a pilot study. In 26 patients who had undergone apicectomy and extirpation of granulomas (n = 9) or radicular cysts (n = 17), concentrations of erythromycin, 2'-acetyl erythromycin, and their anhydro forms were determined with a novel chemical method in plasma and periapical lesions after at least 2 days of treatment with erythromycin acistrate (EA) (400 mg three times daily, n = 11) or erythromycin stearate (ES) (500 mg three times daily, n = 15). Oral surgery was performed 2 1/2 to 3 hours after the last dose. Blood samples were collected at the time of operation, and immediately before antibiotic treatment, and 1, 2, and 6 hours after treatment. At all time points EA produced at least twice the total antibiotic (2'-acetyl erythromycin plus erythromycin) concentrations in plasma as ES. Erythromycin levels in plasma were at least as high after EA treatment as after ES. In periapical lesions erythromycin concentration after EA was three times higher (1.34 +/- 0.28 micrograms/gm) than after ES treatment (0.40 +/- 0.17 micrograms/gm). Although the total drug concentration in periapical lesions was about the same after EA (2.64 micrograms/ml) and ES (3.41 micrograms/ml), most of the drug recovered after ES was antimicrobially inactive anhydroerythromycin (3.01 micrograms/gm). The concentration of anhydroerythromycin in plasma was approximately the same as that of erythromycin after ES throughout the dose interval. After EA treatment both plasma and the periapical lesion samples contained hardly detectable amounts of anhydroerythromycin. Hence EA has a good bioavailability essential for treatment and prophylaxis of bacterial infections in dentistry. 
The ventilatory threshold: method, protocol, and evaluator agreement. To evaluate the effects of different methods of detection, exercise modes, protocols, and reviewers on oxygen uptake (VO2) at the ventilatory threshold (ATge), 17 men with heart disease (mean age 59 +/- 6 years) and six healthy men (mean age 60 +/- 11 years) underwent six exercise tests on different days. Each subject performed three treadmill tests (Bruce, Balke, and ramp) and three bicycle ergometer tests (50 W/stage, 25 W/stage, and ramp) in random order. The ventilatory threshold was determined for each of the six exercise tests by three independent, blinded reviewers by means of graphic plots of three commonly used methods of determination: (1) changes in the ventilatory equivalents for VO2 and VCO2, (2) changes in end-tidal oxygen and carbon dioxide pressures, and (3) the intersection of the slope of VCO2 and VO2 (V slope). The largest variability in the ATge was observed with changes in the exercise protocol. The greatest absolute (ml/min) and percentage differences in oxygen uptake at the ATge as a result of changes in protocol, method of determination, and observers were 336 (36%), 125 (12%), and 70 (7%), respectively. The overall intraclass correlation coefficient for VO2 at the ATge among the three reviewers was 0.60 and among the three protocols was 0.85 (p less than 0.01). The V slope method of detection had consistently good agreement among reviewers and was least affected by the protocol. The variance in the ATge (excluding intersubject and error variance) accounted for by differences in protocol, method, and reviewer was 82%, 14%, and 4%, respectively. 
Bacterial infection as a complication of liver transplantation: epidemiology and risk factors. A retrospective survey was undertaken to characterize the epidemiology of bacterial infection in 79 patients who underwent 103 operations for orthotopic liver transplantation. Fifty-four patients (68%) developed 115 bacterial infections (1.46 episodes per patient), and seven patients died as a result of these infections. Fifty-three percent of bacterial infections occurred within 2 weeks after transplantation and were designated as early infections. The most common sites of infection were the abdomen (35 cases), the bloodstream (31 cases), and the surgical wound (19 cases). Aerobic enteric gram-negative bacilli were the predominant pathogens, and other pathogenic organisms were enterococci, staphylococci, and Pseudomonas bacteria. Logistic regression analysis identified prolonged duration of surgery (greater than or equal to 8 hours) and an elevated bilirubin level (greater than or equal to 12 mg/dL) as risk factors for early bacterial infection at any site; risk factors for abdominal or wound infection were prolonged duration of surgery, increased operative transfusion requirement (greater than or equal to 2 blood volumes), and prior hepatobiliary surgery. Awareness of the sites, pathogens, and time of onset of bacterial infection provides a basis for improved prophylaxis and empiric therapy. 
Roentgenographic dimensions of the upper airway in snoring patients with and without obstructive sleep apnea. The purpose of this study was to examine whether a simple test, such as routine roentgenographic views of the upper airway, is useful in identifying anatomic narrowing of the airway in patients with sleep apnea. To accomplish this, we prospectively studied a group of 117 patients (95 male and 22 female subjects) referred for evaluation of heavy snoring and possible obstructive sleep apnea. All patients had full nocturnal polysomnography, including measurements of snoring. Lateral view of the airway obtained after swallowing contrast material was used to measure pharyngeal diameters at three sites along the airway. All measurements were performed with the patients standing and supine. We used three different definitions of sleep apnea (apnea/hypopnea index of 10, 20, and 40), and compared airway diameters between the apneic and nonapneic snorers. Only when sleep apnea was defined as greater than 40 apneas plus hypopneas per hour of sleep was there a significant difference in airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it between apneic and nonapneic snorers. Both groups of patients demonstrated a significant reduction in the retropalatal distance on assumption of the supine posture. Stepwise, forward, multiple linear regression analysis showed that the retropalatal distance and airway diameter at the tip of the palate and 1 cm distal to it were significant predictors of snoring, but not apnea. We conclude that (1) airway diameters account for some of the variability in snoring, and (2) they do not differentiate between apneic and nonapneic snorers. 
Randomized study of vancomycin versus teicoplanin for the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections in immunocompromised hosts. Seventy-four immunocompromised patients with severe infection due to gram-positive organisms were randomized to receive either vancomycin or teicoplanin. Extensive cancer was present in 71 patients, of whom 47 died within a month. The types of infections were 46 bacteremias (39 associated with central catheters), 24 skin and soft tissue infections (3 with bacteremia), and 7 others (mainly bronchopneumonia). The most frequent pathogen was Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Staphylococcus aureus. Microbiological eradication was obtained in 23 of 35 evaluable patients treated with vancomycin (65.7%) and 28 of 36 patients treated with teicoplanin (77.8%) (P = 0.4). Clinical cure and improvement were obtained in 26 of 35 patients (74.3%) and 27 of 36 patients (75.0%), respectively. No significant side effects were observed with teicoplanin, in contrast to reversible increases in serum creatinine (three patients) and skin rashes (four patients) with vancomycin. Superinfection was observed in five patients treated with vancomycin and two patients treated with teicoplanin. No relation was found between peak concentration in serum (at steady state) or bactericidal titers and outcome. 
Immunocytochemical analysis of the cellular infiltrate in primary regressing and non-regressing malignant melanoma. Spontaneous regression occurs in a small proportion of malignant melanomas, and it is important to understand the processes involved in its induction as this may give a guide to future therapies for this disease. We have examined 36 primary malignant melanomas (19 regressing, 17 non-regressing) and identified the cellular phenotypes and activation states of the cells infiltrating regressing and non-regressing primary melanomas by immunochemistry. We have found a significantly increased number of CD3-positive cells and an increased ratio of CD4/CD8-positive cells infiltrating regressing compared to non-regressing tumors. In addition, the expression of the interleukin 2 receptor, an activation marker for T cells, was increased. However, there were no significant differences in class II MHC, CD1, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), or melanoma-associated differentiation-antigen expression in these tumors. These data are consistent with melanoma regression being induced by activated CD4 T cells and do not seem to be related to the differentiation markers we have examined on these tumors. 
Elective cholecystectomy and carcinoma of the gallbladder. The incidence of carcinoma of the gallbladder has been reputed to be approximately 1.5 per cent among those who undergo surgery for chronic cholecystitis. The incidence at Cabrini Medical Center coincides rather well with that from other studies but has shown a marked decline, 21.5 per cent, within recent years. A report from the American Cancer Society projects an even greater decline to 0.65 per cent in the incidence of this almost incurable disease within the next 1-2 years. The decrease in the incidence of cancer of the gallbladder is attributed to the great increase in the performance of elective cholecystectomy for chronic cholecystitis among people 50 years of age or younger, before they have reached the age when carcinoma of the gallbladder is most prevalent. Early surgery is advocated not only as an effective and safe form of therapy but also as a valuable preventive measure. 
A geriatric-anesthesiologic program to reduce acute confusional states in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a geriatric-anesthesiologic intervention program for the prevention and treatment of acute confusional states (ACS) in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures. The intervention program was based on the results of previous prospective studies in similar patient populations. The outcome of the intervention, comprising 103 patients, was compared with that of an earlier study comprising 111 patients. The intervention program consisted of pre- and post-operative geriatric assessments, oxygen therapy, early surgery, prevention and treatment of peri-operative blood pressure falls and treatment of post-operative complications. The incidence of ACS was lower, 47.6%, in the intervention study compared with 61.3% (P less than 0.05) in the control study. Furthermore, the ACS that occurred in the intervention study was less severe and of shorter duration than that in the control study. The incidence of post-operative decubital ulcers, severe falls, and urinary retention was also lower. The mean duration of orthopedic ward stay was 17.4 days in the control study and 11.6 days in the intervention study (P less than 0.001). It can be concluded that the intervention program reduced the incidence, severity, and duration of ACS which resulted in a shortened orthopedic ward stay. 
Cardiac function after hepatic ischemia-anoxia and reperfusion injury: a new experimental model. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: During liver transplantation, reperfusion of the donor liver and in the clinical setting, end-stage liver disease, have occasionally resulted in profound cardiovascular disturbances. The etiology of hepatic injury-induced myocardial dysfunction is still unclear. In this study, the aims were to develop an experimental model that would facilitate the study of the effects of hepatic failure on myocardial function and to determine whether hepatic ischemia or anoxia and reperfusion injury of similar duration would result in the same degree of hepatic failure. Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats were used as organ donors. Three simultaneous liver-heart perfusions (corresponding to three groups) were established using a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer with 2% bovine albumin, membrane oxygenation, and a peristaltic pump. Group 1 (n = 10) and group 2 (n = 15) experiments consisted of liver-heart perfusions after 90 mins of normothermic hepatic ischemia or 90 mins of hepatic anoxia, respectively, followed by reoxygenation and 60 mins of reperfusion. Group 3 (n = 8) experiments consisted of sham liver-heart perfusions studied over the same experimental time period (60 mins). Myocardial function variables, liver function tests, arterial blood gases, and electrolytes were measured at baseline and at 3-, 10-, 30-, and 60-min intervals during reperfusion in all experiments. RESULTS: Ischemia or anoxia-induced hepatic failure resulted in a similar degree of hepatic dysfunction. Both forms of acute hepatic failure caused significant increases in liver function tests, a reduction in heart rate (p less than .05), coronary flow (p less than .05), and an increase in calculated coronary vascular resistance (p less than .05). There were no changes in buffer pH, CO2, or ionized calcium that could explain the coronary vasoconstriction. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic dysfunction induced by ischemia or anoxia of similar duration results in a similar hepatic metabolic profile during reperfusion and can cause direct myocardial dysfunction of the isolated perfused rat heart. 
Complications of infection and immunologic status after surgery for patients with esophageal cancer. Correlations between defective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and infections following surgery for esophageal cancer were evaluated. Peripheral lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, PHA transformation, and PPD skin test were measured in 81 patients with esophageal cancer, 58 with gastric cancer, and 50 healthy controls. The depression of CMI was predominant to a similar extent in patients with esophageal cancer and in those with gastric cancer. The average level of PHA transformation immediately before surgery was significantly lower in the esophageal cancer patients with fatal septic complications than in those without such problems. Although preoperative radiation therapy markedly depressed the levels of the four parameters, this association was also noted in 28 patients not given radiation. It thus appears that PHA transformation may be valuable in the prediction of fatal septic complications after major surgery in patients with esophageal cancer. 
Impact of two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy with intraarterial cisplatin and intravenous doxorubicin on the choice of surgical procedure for high-grade bone sarcomas of the extremities. The authors assessed the impact of two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy (POCT) with intraarterial cisplatin (120 mg/m2) and continuous intravenous doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin; 20 mg/m2/day x 3 days) on the decision to perform a limb-sparing procedure (LSP) or amputation in 22 patients with high-grade bone sarcomas of the extremities. The tumor types were osteosarcoma (17), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (three), leiomyosarcoma (one), and malignant schwannoma (one). Surgical stages were IIA (three), IIB (17), and IIIB (two). The prechemotherapy surgical options chosen were 12 amputations (55% of patients) and ten LSPs (45%). The initial decisions to amputate were based on a combination of the following: improper biopsy (five cases), large tumors (ten) and those with neurovascular encroachment (six), and pathological fracture (one). Following chemotherapy, 18 LSPs (81%) and four amputations (19%) were performed. Nine of 12 patients (75%) initially deemed unresectable were converted to LSP. The median tumor response (necrosis; range, 0%-100%) was 70%; ten of 22 specimens had necrosis greater than 95%. Median tumor necrosis for the patients treated by amputation and LSPs was 45% and 88%, respectively. Following surgery, all patients received four additional cycles of cisplatin and doxorubicin. The median follow-up period is 30 months; six patients have developed metastatic disease, with a median disease-free interval of 16.6 months. The rate of local tumor control is 95% (21 of 22 patients). 
Prevalence and treatment of giardiasis in chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition. To determine the prevalence of giardiasis in Gambian children with chronic diarrhoea and to assess their response to treatment, 31 children with chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition were investigated for giardiasis using a combination of serology (specific antigiardia IgM antibody) and microscopy of faeces and jejunal biopsy specimens. Fourteen of 31 children with chronic diarrhoea had giardiasis compared with only four of 33 healthy age and sex matched control children. Four of 15 malnourished children without diarrhoea were giardia positive. Twenty-three children with chronic diarrhoea were reinvestigated after treatment with metronidazole; giardia was found in 11 of them. These results show that giardia is highly prevalent in children with chronic diarrhoea and malnutrition and that the infection does not respond to standard therapeutic measures. 
Cardiac toxicity 4 to 20 years after completing anthracycline therapy. OBJECTIVE.--To assess the cardiac status of long-term survivors of pediatric malignancies who received chemotherapy, including anthracyclines. DESIGN AND METHOD.-Patients were evaluated by echocardiogram from 4 to 20 years (median, 7 years) after completion of anthracyclines, with prospective and retrospective analysis. PATIENTS.--The consecutive sample of 201 patients had received a total anthracycline dose of 200 to 1275 mg/m2 (median, 450 mg/m2), and 51 patients had mediastinal radiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The overall incidence and severity of abnormal systolic cardiac function were determined for the entire cohort. Risk factors of total anthracycline dose, mediastinal radiotherapy, age during treatment, and length of follow-up were examined. RESULTS.--Twenty-three percent (47/201) of the cohort had abnormal cardiac function on noninvasive testing at long-term follow-up. Correlation between total cumulative dose, length of follow-up, and mediastinal irradiation with incidence of abnormalities was significant. Fifty-six patients were followed up for 10 years or more (median, 12 years), with a median anthracycline dose of 495 mg/m2. Thirty-eight percent (21/56) of these patients, compared with 18% (26/145) of patients evaluated after less than 10 years, had abnormal findings. Sixty-three percent of patients followed up for 10 years or more after receiving 500 mg/m2 or more of anthracyclines had abnormal findings. Nine of 201 patients had late symptoms, including cardiac failure and dysrhythmia, and three patients died suddenly. Microscopic examination of the myocardium on biopsy and autopsy revealed fibrosis. CONCLUSION.--The 23% incidence of late cardiac abnormalities warrants continued evaluation of patients after anthracyclines to guide patient care and the design of future chemotherapeutic protocols. 
Carcinomatous meningitis: antibody-guided therapy with I-131 HMFG1. Seven patients with carcinomatous meningitis were administered intrathecal I-131 labelled monoclonal antibody HMFG1. Clinical responses were seen in two patients, with a long term survivor at 32 months. Aseptic meningitis occurred in 4/7 patients, but more serious toxicity was observed in the form of seizures (2/7 patients) and myelosuppression (3/7 patients). Partial obliteration of the subarachnoid space was identified as a potential problem in patients with advanced disease. 
Computer-assisted superimposition of magnetic resonance and high-resolution technetium-99m-HMPAO and thallium-201 SPECT images of the brain. A method for registering three-dimensional CT, MR, and PET data sets that require no special patient immobilization or other precise positioning measures was adapted to high-resolution SPECT and MRI and was applied in 14 subjects (five normal volunteers, four patients with dementia (Alzheimer's disease), two patients with recurrent glioblastoma, and three patients with focal lesions (stroke, arachnoid cyst and head trauma]. T2-weighted axial magnetic resonance images and transaxial 99mTc-HMPAO and 201Tl images acquired with an annular gamma camera were merged using an objective registration (translation, rotation and rescaling) program. In the normal subjects and patients with dementia and focal lesions, focal areas of high uptake corresponded to gray matter structures. Focal lesions observed on MRI corresponded to perfusion defects on SPECT. In the patients who had undergone surgical resection of glioblastoma followed by interstitial brachytherapy, increased 201Tl corresponding to recurrent tumor could be localized from the superimposed images. The method was evaluated by measuring the residuals in all subjects and translational errors due to superimposition of deep structures in the 12 subjects with normal thalamic anatomy and 99mTc-HMPAO uptake. This method for superimposing magnetic resonance and high-resolution SPECT images of the brain is a useful technique for correlating regional function with brain anatomy. 
Effect of Iraqi missile war on incidence of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death in Israeli civilians. The Iraqi missile attack on Israel provided a unique opportunity to study the effects of fright due to a perceived threat of annihilation on the incidence of acute myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden death among the civilian population. During the first days of the Gulf war we noted a sharp rise in the incidence of acute MI and sudden death in our area compared with five control periods. Patient population in the various study periods did not differ significantly in age, sex ratio, hospital mortality, or proportion of patients in whom the acute event was the first presentation of coronary disease. However, during the first period of the war there were more cases of anterior wall MI and more patients received thrombolytic therapy than during control periods. Despite the continuing missile threat, the incidence of acute MI reverted to normal after the initial phase of the Gulf war. 
Correlative angiographic and pathologic findings in the diagnosis of ulcerated plaques in the carotid artery. We determined the accuracy of angiography in the diagnosis of internal carotid ulcers by comparing the angiographic reports with the pathologic findings in 36 endarterectomy specimens. Eighteen of these specimens had microscopic ulcerations, and the observer with the highest accuracy rate read 12, of which ten were ulcerated. These results revealed a sensitivity of 56%, a specificity of 89%, and an overall accuracy of 61% for angiography. The ulcers were classified into types A, B, and C to assess the interobserver agreement rate among three readers. This resulted in a 4% interobserver agreement among a total of 75 ulcers. Because of the high interobserver disagreement and the poor correlation between angiographic and pathologic findings in the surgical specimens, we conclude that the diagnosis of carotid artery ulceration by angiography is not reliable. 
Measurement of hip prostheses using image analysis. The maxima hip technique. A computer-based image analysis system has been developed as a research tool in total hip replacement. The system has been programmed to take multiple measurements from coronal plane radiographs. Poor quality radiographic images can be enhanced and standardised. The measurements which can be obtained include stem subsidence, cup migration, cup wear, and stem loosening. Reproducibility and accuracy were +/- 0.01 mm and +/- 0.5 mm respectively. The present application is in retrospective research, but prospective monitoring of radiographs is planned. 
Failure of wild-type or a mutant form of protein kinase C-alpha to transform fibroblasts. A mutant form of the alpha-isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) was recently isolated from an ultraviolet radiation-induced murine fibrosarcoma cell line and reported to transform mouse BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts on transfection. Four point mutations in the regulatory domain were assumed to be responsible for its oncogenicity and unusual preference for membrane localization. Here, we report that overexpression of the reported mutant PKC alpha complementary DNA in three fibroblast cell lines, including BALB/c 3T3, does not enable these cells to grow in soft agar or nude mice. In addition, this mutant PKC alpha form seems to be indistinguishable from the wild-type PKC alpha with respect to its dependence on cofactors, phorbol ester binding, subcellular distribution and its effects on growth and morphology. These results fail to confirm the previous study and indicate that overexpression of either the wild-type or the reported mutant form of PKC alpha does not transform rodent fibroblasts. 
Analysis of pituitary hormones and chromogranin A mRNAs in null cell adenomas, oncocytomas, and gonadotroph adenomas by in situ hybridization. To study the relationship between null cell adenomas, oncocytomas and gonadotroph adenomas, we analyzed 32 surgically removed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pituitary tumors for the expression of pituitary hormone messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by in situ hybridization (ISH). Most tumors were also analyzed for chromogranin A mRNA. To identify the cell type constituting the tumors and to assess hormone content, all tumors were investigated by histology, transmission electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Most null cell adenomas (6/11) and gonadotroph adenomas (9/10) expressed the mRNAs for alpha-subunit of glycoprotein hormones whereas only 2/11 oncocytomas expressed alpha-subunit mRNA. FSH beta and/or LH beta mRNA were present in most null cell and gonadotroph adenomas but only in a few oncocytomas. Prolactin (PRL) mRNA was detected in two null cell tumors and in one gonadotroph adenoma, whereas GH and POMC mRNA were present in one null cell adenoma. Chromogranin A mRNA, which codes for the major secretory granule protein, was present in 25/26 tumors including all tumors that were negative for pituitary hormone mRNAs, indicating adequate preservation of specific mRNA transcripts in the paraffin-embedded sections of tumor cells. These results indicate that null cell adenomas and gonadotroph adenomas are closely related neoplasms and that oncocytomas may represent a functionally defective form of null cell adenoma characterized by mitochondrial abundance, which has retained the capacity to synthesize the major secretory granule protein chromogranin A. Although the cytogenesis of null cell adenomas and oncocytomas is not clear, it can be suggested that these two tumor types are derived from a pluripotential precursor cell that is capable of undergoing multidirectional differentiation and synthesizing various hormones, mainly glycoproteins. 
Localization of endogenous beta-galactoside-binding lectin as a means to distinguish malignant from benign skin tissue. The immunolocalization of a 30-kd endogenous lectin, referred to as galaptin, was studied in various skin tumor types. Basal cell carcinomas expressed little or no galaptin, whereas nonmalignant basaloid cells, squamous cell carcinomas, melanoma, nevi, and stroma showed more prominent galaptin immunostaining. Therefore, the immunodetection of galaptin may aid the dermatopathologist in difficult histologic diagnosis. 
Pain-related somatosensory evoked potentials in syringomyelia. Pain-related somatosensory evoked potentials following CO2 laser stimulation (pain SEPs) and conventional electrically-stimulated SEPs (electric SEPs) were examined in 8 patients with syringomyelia who showed various forms of dissociated sensory loss. Unlike clinical examination using a pin or needle, pain SEP is considered to be an objective and quantitative test to investigate functions of peripheral and central sensory pathways responsible for pain-temperature sensation (A delta fibres and the spinothalamic tract). Pain SEPs were abnormal in all patients. The results were generally compatible with the degree of a clinical impairment of pain-temperature sensation. Subclinical abnormality was detected in 3 patients. Electric median nerve SEPs using the scalp reference (Fz) were normal in 6 out of 8 patients. However, anterior and posterior cervical responses using a noncephalic reference were absent or small in 7 patients. Electric SEPs following tibial nerve stimulation were normal in 7 patients. These findings suggest that the function of the ascending fibres through the dorsal columns is intact in most patients, whereas the dorsal horn, where a fixed cervical potential is generated, is impaired. Pain SEPs combined with electric SEPs therefore appear to be extremely useful for investigating physiological function in the sensory pathways in patients who show 'dissociated sensory loss' such as in syringomyelia. 
Coronary-subclavian steal: correction of recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms. Six months following aortic valve replacement and myocardial revascularization using the left internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft, recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms occurred in our patient. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a subtotal stenosis of the proximal left subclavian artery and a patent internal mammary artery graft with angiographic steal from the myocardium. The angina and cerebrovascular symptoms were relieved with correction of the proximal subclavian stenosis by balloon angioplasty. This demonstrates the importance of aortic arch and subclavian evaluation and selected angiography prior to myocardial revascularization using the internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft. 
Small animal thrombosis models for the evaluation of thrombolytic agents. BACKGROUND. Two thrombosis models for the evaluation of thrombolytic agents in small animals (less than 100 g) were evaluated: an iodine-125 fibrin-labeled rat plasma clot in the inferior caval vein of 3-4-week-old rats and a pulmonary embolus in adult hamsters that had been obtained by injection of a 125I fibrin-labeled human plasma clot. The extent of thrombolysis was determined by continuous external monitoring of radioisotope over the thrombus region and by ex vivo recovery of residual clot. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the rat model, infusion of solvent for 60 minutes was associated with mean +/- SEM lysis within 90 minutes of 13 +/- 3% (n = 8) by external counting and 26 +/- 4% (n = 8) by radioisotope recovery. Intravenous infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) over 60 minutes caused dose-dependent progressive clot lysis; with 0.5 mg/kg, producing a plasma level of 0.14 +/- 0.04 microgram/ml, lysis was 64 +/- 9% (n = 4) by external gamma counting and 78 +/- 4% (n = 4) by residual isotope in the vein segment and was not associated with significant fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin breakdown. In the hamster model, infusion of solvent for 60 minutes was associated with lysis within 90 minutes of 19 +/- 4% (n = 11) by external gamma counting and 31 +/- 3% (n = 14) by residual radioisotope. Intravenous rt-PA during 60 minutes resulted in dose-dependent progressive thrombolysis; with 0.5 mg/kg, producing a plasma level of 0.14 +/- 0.01 micrograms/ml, lysis was 50 +/- 4% (n = 4) by external gamma counting and 78 +/- 5% (n = 4) by residual radioactivity, without an extensive decrease in fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin. Parallel experiments in the rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model with a rabbit blood clot with intravenous infusion over 4 hours produced 7 +/- 2% (n = 9) lysis with solvent and dose-dependent progressive lysis with rt-PA; with 1 mg/kg, producing a plasma level of 0.20 +/- 0.03 microgram/ml, lysis was 56 +/- 7% (n = 7) by external gamma counting and 61 +/- 7% (n = 7) by residual radioactivity, without extensive consumption of fibrinogen or alpha 2-antiplasmin. CONCLUSIONS. These two thrombosis models in small animals are as reproducible and quantitative as the extensively used rabbit jugular vein thrombosis model. The hamster pulmonary embolism model is superior because it is simpler and more straightforward and allows the performance of as many as 10 experiments by one investigator in 1 day. 
Tuberculous pleural effusions: increased culture yield with bedside inoculation of pleural fluid and poor diagnostic value of adenosine deaminase. A prospective study of 111 adult patients with a pleural effusion was carried out in an area with a high prevalence of tuberculosis to compare the yield of bedside with laboratory inoculation of pleural fluid, and the yield and speed of a radiometric mycobacterial culture system (BACTEC) with that of conventional culture. The use of adenosine deaminase activity in pleural fluid as a diagnostic test for tuberculosis was also evaluated. In the 62 cases of tuberculosis confirmed histologically or by culture, or both, the BACTEC system had the same culture yield as conventional mycobacterial culture (positive in 14 cases-23%), but was significantly faster (18 versus 33 days). Bedside inoculation had a culture yield significantly higher than laboratory inoculation in the 24 patients tested (11 versus four). The remaining three diagnostic categories were malignant (28), miscellaneous (10), and undiagnosed (11). Median adenosine deaminase activity was significantly higher in tuberculous effusions than in any of the other categories, but there was considerable overlap between the groups. It is concluded that the BACTEC system is significantly faster than conventional mycobacterial culture and that bedside inoculation of pleural fluid substantially increases culture yield. Adenosine deaminase does not provide as valuable a diagnostic test of pleural tuberculosis as has been suggested. 
The role of preoperative CT scans in staging external auditory meatus carcinoma: radiologic-pathologic correlation study. Survival is related to the pathologic extent of tumor in external auditory meatus (EAM) carcinoma. This study assesses the validity of preoperative CT scans in staging EAM carcinoma. The accuracy of staging EAM carcinoma with preoperative CT scans was evaluated by comparing radiography and histopathology. Patients who received preoperative CT scan were selected from a retrospective series of 35 temporal bone resections for EAM squamous cell carcinoma. The CT scans were systematically reviewed for tumor involvement in 12 anatomic areas. The histopathology slides for the corresponding patients were reviewed according to the same criteria. CT scan findings accurately diagnosed the extent of tumor involvement identified during histopathologic examination. These tumors demonstrated the capacity to spread along existing anatomic pathways as well as direct bone erosion. We conclude that preoperative CT scans accurately stage EAM squamous cell carcinoma. 
Effect of acupuncture-point stimulation on diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive subjects: a preliminary study. Electrical stimulation of four specific acupuncture points (Liver 3, Stomach 36, Large Intestine 11, and the Groove for Lowering Blood Pressure) was examined in order to determine the effect of this stimulation on diastolic blood pressure in 10 subjects with diastolic hypertension. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: (1) an Acu-ES group, which received electrical stimulation applied to the four antihypertensive acupuncture points, and (2) a Sham-ES group, which received electrical stimulation applied to non-acupuncture-point areas. A repeated-measures analysis of variance revealed a significant, immediate poststimulation reduction of diastolic blood pressure for the Acu-Es group versus the Sham-ES group. Further studies are needed to determine whether there are other acupuncture points, stimulation characteristics, or modalities that can enhance this treatment effect and whether the treatment effect can last for a clinically significant period of time. 
The European Stroke Prevention Study (ESPS): results by arterial distribution. The European Stroke Prevention Study was a multicenter study comparing the effect of the combination of dipyridamole, 75 mg, and acetylsalicylic acid, 330 mg, three times a day, to that of placebo in 2,500 patients in the secondary prevention of stroke or death after one or more transient ischemic attacks, reversible ischemic neurological deficits, or strokes of atherothrombotic origin. The patients with vertebrobasilar events at entry comprised one-third of the whole patient population. The overall total incidence of stroke or death (the end points) during the 2-year follow-up in the placebo group was lower in the vertebrobasilar group compared to the carotid group (14% versus 24%, respectively). The combination therapy of dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid caused a marked reduction in the incidence of stroke or death in patients with vertebrobasilar (51%) and carotid (30%) events. When only stroke was considered as the end point, dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid seemed to be more effective in reducing the risk of transient ischemic attacks than stroke, and more effective in men than in women. 
Frequency and mechanism of bradycardia in cardiac transplant recipients and need for pacemakers. Orthotopic cardiac transplantation is occasionally complicated by unexplained bradyarrhythmias. Sinus node injury as a consequence of operation or acute rejection has anecdotally been linked to the development of bradycardia early after transplantation. These arrhythmias are empirically managed by pacemaker implantation, the indications for which remain poorly defined. This retrospective study examined the 20-year experience of our institution with bradyarrhythmias after transplantation to determine the predisposing factors and indications for pacemaker implantation. Forty-one of 556 patients in our cardiac transplant program (7.4%) received permanent pacemakers between 1969 and 1989. The predominant rhythm disturbances were junctional rhythm (46%), sinus arrest (27%) and sinus bradycardia (17%). Most patients were asymptomatic (61%), and presented in the early post-transplant period (73%). Four possible predisposing factors were evaluated: (1) graft ischemic time, (2) rejection history, (3) use of bradycardia-inducing drugs, and (4) anatomy of blood supply to the sinoatrial (SA) node. No significant differences existed between patients with and without pacemakers with regard to the first 3 variables. However, after transplantation angiograms showed that prevalence of abnormal SA nodal arteries was greater in patients with than without pacemakers (p less than 0.02). Pacemaker follow-up at 3, 6 and 12 months showed persistent bradycardia (60 to 90 beats/min) in 88, 75 and 50% of patients, respectively. The most common pacemaker complication (15%) was lead displacement at time of biopsy. These results suggest that disruption of the SA nodal blood supply may be an important predisposing factor in the development of bradycardias. 
Glassy cell features in adenosquamous carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Histologic, ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and clinical findings. Glassy cell features (GCF) were identified as composing a predominant pattern (more than 85% of histology) in six cases and a focal pattern (33-85% of histology) in 10 cases of a series of 53 adenocarcinomas (AC) and adenosquamous carcinomas (ADSQ) of the uterine cervix. In three cases examined ultrastructurally, GCFs correlated with many cytoplasmic polyribosomes and abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum, but Golgi complexes and tonofilaments were scant and intracytoplasmic lumina were absent. Intracellular mucin was present in the areas showing GCFs of four ADSQs with predominant GCFs and six ADSQs with focal GCFs. Two of three cases examined ultrastructurally showed intracellular electron-dense material that corresponded to mucin secretory material. Immunohistochemical studies of the six ADSQs with predominant GCF cases showed the following pattern of reactivity: monoclonal carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), 2 of 6 cases; polyclonal CEA, 3 of 6; CA 125, 0 of 6; CA 19-9, 0 of 6; placental alkaline phosphatase, 0 of 6; and vimentin, 1 of 6. Focal GCF areas showed monoclonal CEA, 4 of 9 cases; polyclonal CEA, 3 of 9; vimentin, 4 of 9; while CA 125, CA 19-9, and placental alkaline phosphatase were negative in areas of GCFs. One of three patients with ADSQ with predominant GCFs and five of nine patients with ADSQ with focal GCFs with at least 1 year of follow-up were disease free. No association between GCFs (combined focal and predominant) and recurrent disease was present when compared to the other 29 AC and ADSQ patients with follow-up. Recurrent disease in our series of AC and ADSQ was only associated with stage III or IV disease at presentation (P less than 0.001). There was no association with adenosquamous histology, histologic grade, lymphatic invasion, or age. There were insufficient cases of ADSQ with predominant GCFs with follow-up to evaluate fully prognostic significance of this subgroup. Our study suggests that GCFs are part of the spectrum of differentiation in ADSQ of the cervix rather than a distinct histologic type of carcinoma with unique clinical significance. 
Activation of pain fibers to the internal carotid artery intracranially may cause the pain and local signs of reduced sympathetic and enhanced parasympathetic activity in cluster headache. Several clinical and circulatory physiological observations indicate that the internal carotid artery (ICA) with proximal pial and orbital-periorbital branches, as well as external carotid vessels adjacent to the orbital region, are involved in the autonomic symptoms of an attack of cluster headache. Evidence is presented here that an activation of pain fibers innervating the intracranial segment of ICA may cause not only the retroorbital pain of an attack but also, via the mechanical effect of a neurogenic inflammation in the vessel wall, the local symptoms of a sympathetic defect and, via a reflex are to the parasympathetic pathway along the greater superficial petrosal nerve, the local symptoms from glands and vessels of parasympathetic discharge. Dilation of the intracranial ICA due to activation of this parasympathetic pathway may aggravate pain. Possible mechanisms behind such a local pain fiber activation are discussed. 
Use of amiodarone for short-term and adjuvant therapy in young patients. Limited data are available defining the safety of amiodarone for short-term use or as part of combination antiarrhythmic therapy in pediatric patients. Results of amiodarone in 47 young patients for an average treatment duration of 12 months were examined. There were 21 male and 26 female patients (age range of 23 weeks gestation to 29 years). Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1--electrocardiographic documented ventricular tachycardia (n = 7); group 2--syncope of unknown cause (n = 16); group 3--primary atrial tachycardia (n = 11); and group 4--supraventricular tachycardia (n = 13). Amiodarone was clinically useful in 32 (68%) patients. Amiodarone was considered effective as a sole antiarrhythmic agent in 21 (45%) patients. Treatment was ineffective but was continued in 11 (23%) patients; in 10 of these 11 patients amiodarone was adjuvant to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone was considered ineffective and was withdrawn in 15 (32%) patients. No patient required cardiac pacemaker implant during therapy. Torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest occurred in 1 patient each after 9 and 14 days of therapy, respectively. Two patients underwent successful cardiac transplant after 2 and 14 months of amiodarone administration, respectively. Amiodarone was used as short-term treatment (less than 18 months) in 7 infants (age less than 18 months), and after cessation of treatment there was no recurrence of tachycardia for 4 to 24 months. Results of this study confirm reports of successful amiodarone use in pediatric patients with a variety of rhythm disturbances. 
Regression of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertensive heart transplant recipients treated with enalapril, furosemide, and verapamil. BACKGROUND. This prospective study was designed to examine whether left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy of the denervated transplanted heart may be reversed by medical therapy and, if so, to investigate the time course of this process and its effect on exercise capacity, myocardial function, and cardiac hemodynamics. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ten hypertensive heart transplant recipients with LV hypertrophy were evaluated before therapy with enalapril plus furosemide alone or combined with verapamil, at initial blood pressure (BP) control and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, using 24-hour noninvasive ambulatory BP monitoring, M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography, and supine bicycle ergometry. Average 24-hour systolic and diastolic BP declined from 158 +/- 10 and 104 +/- 7 mm Hg to 129 +/- 9 and 84 +/- 10 mm Hg at initial BP control (p less than 0.005 and p less than 0.025, respectively) and total peripheral resistance from 1,687 +/- 177 to 1,376 +/- 122 dyne.sec.cm-5 (p less than 0.025), remaining normal thereafter. Exercise capacity remained unchanged during the study. LV mass, mass-to-volume ratio, and end-diastolic septal plus posterior wall thickness decreased progressively from 211 +/- 30 g, 2.49 +/- 0.62 g/ml, and 25.7 +/- 2.6 mm to 184 +/- 26 g, 2.22 +/- 0.46 g/ml, and 22.5 +/- 1.9 mm after 3 months (all p less than 0.025) and to 174 +/- 25 g, 2.07 +/- 0.38 g/ml, and 21.5 +/- 1.5 mm after 6 months (all p less than 0.005), remaining unaltered at 9 and 12 months. A correlation was found between the decrease in average 24-hour mean BP and LV mass after 3 months of antihypertensive therapy (r = 0.71, p less than 0.05). Systolic meridional wall stress, LV end-diastolic and stroke volume, ejection fraction, and cardiac output remained unchanged throughout the observation period. CONCLUSIONS. The results indicate that regression of LV hypertrophy is induced by effective antihypertensive therapy in the denervated transplanted heart. The extent of decrease in average 24-hour BP appears to be the main determinant for the extent of reduction in LV mass. LV afterload as characterized by systolic meridional wall stress, LV size and pump function, and physical exercise capacity of the transplant patients are not influenced by the therapeutic regimen chosen in this study. 
Epidemiology of myasthenia gravis in Denmark. A longitudinal and comprehensive population survey. The incidence of myasthenia gravis (MG) was found to be constant in calendar time. The mean annual incidence rate was 4.4 per million population. Age- and sex-specific incidence rates disclosed a bimodal appearance for both sexes, with a peak age at onset located in the early-onset group and another peak for late onset of MG. Early onset of MG appeared 10 years later for male individuals than for female individuals, whereas the peak for late onset of MG was located at the same age for both sexes. It is suggested that the separation between early onset and late onset of MG should be at the age of 50 years for both sexes, rather than at 35 to 40 years as accepted in most studies. The prevalence of MG has increased in time. On January 1, 1988, the point prevalence rate was 77 per million population (female subjects, 96, and male subjects, 57). This reflects an improvement in prognosis despite the fact that life expectancy was found to be significantly lower for MG patients than that of the sex- and age-matched population. The factors causing increased mortality were found to be operative throughout the duration of the disease. Maximum severity of disease was reached within 2 years from onset in 78% of the cases, and more than 50% of all MG-related deaths occurred during the same period. In the course of MG, 70% of all patients experience generalized muscular weakness, and 30% to 40% also suffer from respiratory problems. 
Near-infrared spectroscopy in peripheral vascular disease. Near-infrared spectroscopy has been performed on the calf muscles of 38 subjects, 21 normal controls without vascular disease and 17 patients with peripheral vascular disease. Oxygen consumption was measured in the calf by calculating the rate of conversion of oxyhaemoglobin to deoxyhaemoglobin during a period of tourniquet-induced ischaemia. Postischaemic reoxygenation was also measured. Median oxygen consumption in patients with peripheral vascular disease was 0.10 ml 100 g tissue-1 min-1, while in the control group it was 0.20 ml 100 g tissue-1 min-1 (P less than 0.03, Mann-Whitney U test). The median time taken to reach maximum oxyhaemoglobin levels after ischaemia was 40 s in patients with peripheral vascular disease and 20 s in controls (P less than 0.02). The results indicate that oxygen consumption is reduced in peripheral vascular disease. Near infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive method for assessing metabolic improvement resulting from surgical or pharmacological treatment. 
Diagnostic value of video-EEG polysomnography. To investigate the diagnostic value of video-EEG polysomnography (VPSG), we reviewed our experience in 122 patients with suspected parasomnias who underwent one or two nights of VPSG. Of 86 patients without known epilepsy, VPSG provided useful diagnostic information for 41 (69%) of those with a history of prominent motor activity during sleep and for 11 (41%) of those with a history of minor motor activity during sleep. Two children and one adult with clinical histories suggestive of sleep terrors had unequivocal partial seizures during VPSG. Of 36 patients with known epilepsy, VPSG was useful diagnostically in 28 (78%). VPSG is superior to standard polysomnography for the evaluation of parasomnias because of the increased capability to identify and localize EEG abnormalities and to correlate behavior with EEG and polysomnography. VPSG may also be a suitable alternative to intensive inpatient monitoring for some patients with known or suspected epilepsy who have frequent undiagnosed nocturnal spells. 
Abdominal aortic aneurysm in chronic thoracic dissection. Report of two cases. Two cases of lower abdominal aortic aneurysm in association with chronic thoracic dissections are reported. These infra-renal aortic aneurysms, superimposed on an abdominal extension of the dissection, always require surgical treatment because of their well known tendency to enlarge and rupture. The authors report their experience and discuss the management of this complication in chronic dissections treated surgically. 
Sequestrin, a CD36 recognition protein on Plasmodium falciparum malaria-infected erythrocytes identified by anti-idiotype antibodies. The CD36 molecule expressed by human endothelial cells is a receptor for the adhesion of erythrocytes infected with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. A CD36-specific monoclonal antibody, OKM8, inhibits the adhesion of malaria-infected erythrocytes (IRBC) to purified CD36 and cells expressing CD36. Monospecific polyclonal anti-idiotype (anti-Id) antibodies, raised against monoclonal antibody OKM8, expressed determinants molecularly mimicking the CD36 binding domain for the adhesion of IRBC. Purified rabbit anti-Id antibodies reacted with the surface of IRBC by immunofluorescence, directly supported the adhesion of wild-type P. falciparum malaria isolates, and inhibited IRBC cytoadherence to melanoma cells. An approximately 270-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Id antibodies from surface-labeled and metabolically labeled IRBC and was competitively inhibited by soluble CD36. These results support the hypothesis that CD36 is a receptor and the approximately 270-kDa protein, sequestrin, is a complementary ligand involved in the adhesion of IRBC to host-cell endothelium. Sequestrin is a candidate malaria vaccine antigen, and anti-Id antibodies that recognize this molecule may be useful for passive immunotherapy of cerebral and severe P. falciparum malaria. 
Hypothalamic amenorrhea: clinical perspectives, pathophysiology, and management. The development of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea reflects an individual's response to environmental stressors and life-style variables. In this disorder there are no detectable anatomic abnormalities with respect to the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian-endometrial axis. Current evidence suggests that the common underlying defect is a decrease in the activity of the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator. Of the neuroendocrine factors that appear to regulate gonadotropin-releasing hormone activity, the opiate and dopamine neuronal systems have been implicated as factors that are responsible in part for the decreased secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone. Because of the functional nature of this disorder, reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary unit would be expected to take place in most women after accommodation to environmental stressors or modification in life-style. For women with persistent anovulation, treatment with estrogen-replacement therapy should be offered. In those desiring fertility, ovulation induction with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone would be the most effective modality. 
The office evaluation of infectious diarrhea. Diarrhea is a frequent complaint heard in the office practice of medicine and can represent any of a variety of processes, including several infectious causes. Clues to the infectious processes are reviewed and an approach to their evaluation from history, through physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and initial therapy are discussed. 
Prevalence of risk factors for heart disease in OXCHECK trial: implications for screening in primary care. Imperial Cancer Research Fund OXCHECK Study Group. OBJECTIVE--To describe the outcome of offering health checks systematically to a general practice adult population, in terms of age and sex specific prevalence of risk factors, follow up workload, and selective screening of cholesterol concentration. DESIGN--Descriptive analysis of data obtained by postal questionnaire and by personal interview and clinical examination by a trained nurse. SUBJECTS--2205 patients aged 35-64 who attended for a health check in 1989-90 from an invited random sample of 2777 patients from five urban general practices in Bedfordshire. RESULTS--Overall, almost three quarters of patients (78% of men, 68% of women) needed specific advice or follow up. Smoking, a high fat diet, and being overweight (body mass index greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2) were common characteristics exhibited by 35%, 31%, and 55% respectively of men and 24%, 18%, and 48% of women. The total cholesterol concentration was greater than or equal to 6.5 mmol/l in 37% of patients and greater than or equal to 8 mmol/l in 8%. In terms of workload 13% needed dietary advice only, 15% needed only follow up of hyperlipidaemia or hypertension, and 9% needed advice on smoking only. A further 35% needed follow up for a combination of risk factors. The proportion of patients in whom cholesterol concentration would be measured if a selective screening policy were adopted would vary from 29% to 71%, according to different criteria, but (particularly in men) no combination would be much better than random testing as a means to detect patients with a total cholesterol concentration greater than or equal to 8 mmol/l. CONCLUSIONS--If the entire adult population of a practice is offered health checks systematically the acceptance rate is lower and the follow up workload higher than previously understood. The resource implications depend on the age and sex of patients screened and the selective criteria adopted for cholesterol measurement. Health checks are only the beginning of a successful preventive programme--the challenge is to provide effective intervention and follow up. 
Intracellular gastrin in human gastrointestinal tumor cells. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses of the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line MKN45G identified an intracellular peptide recognized by an anti-gastrin-17 (G17) antiserum but not by an anti-cholecystokinin-specific antiserum. Staining was not associated with the parental line MKN45, of which MKN45G is a clonal variant. The MKN45G cell line had elevated in vitro growth in serum-free medium in which the proliferation of MKN45G cells but not MKN45 cells was reduced to 58% of the control value by treatment with a rabbit anti-G17 antiserum. This inhibition of proliferation was reversed by preabsorbing the antiserum with excess G17. Disaggregated primary human gastric and colorectal tumors were screened for gastrin immunoreactivity by flow cytometry, and 6 of 28 colorectal and 8 of 22 gastric tumors had greater than 20% positively staining cells. 
Role of arteriography in the preoperative evaluation of carotid artery disease. This retrospective study was undertaken to determine the role of arteriography in the treatment of patients being considered for carotid endarterectomy. The results of preoperative classification of disease severity by duplex ultrasound and arteriography were compared, and the impact of arteriography on patient management was ascertained. We reviewed the records of 83 patients who had carotid surgery planned on the basis of their clinical history and duplex scan results and who then underwent arteriography. Duplex scan results agreed with the classification of stenosis by arteriography in 87% of evaluated sides and were within one category in 98%. In 87% of the cases reviewed, the clinical presentation and duplex scan findings were sufficient for appropriate patient management. In the instances that arteriography was useful (13%), the need for arteriography was evident when the duplex scan (1) was technically inadequate or equivocal; (2) showed an unusual distribution of disease, atypical anatomy, or a recurrent lesion; or (3) demonstrated an internal carotid artery with diameter-reducing stenosis of less than 50% in a patient with hemispheric neurologic symptoms despite antiplatelet therapy. 
Intraocular tissue plasminogen activator in a rabbit model of traumatic hyphema. Tissue plasminogen activator was used to evaluate the clearance of traumatic hyphema in a rabbit model. A neodymium-YAG laser was used to disrupt iris vessels, creating a traumatic hyphema. Tissue plasminogen activator (1800 IU/0.1 mL) was injected into the anterior chamber 24 hours after creation of the hyphema. Two control groups (one receiving balanced salt solution and one receiving no treatment) were used for comparison. A multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that the greatest difference in hyphema clearance between the groups occurred at days 3, 4, and 5. Five days after tissue plasminogen activator treatment, the mean size of the clot remaining in the anterior chamber was 27% of that of the original hyphema. In control eyes, almost 60% of the original clot remained at day 5. Treatment of animals with tissue plasminogen activator doses of 5000 IU and 10,000 IU produced a substantial increase in repeated bleeding episodes in our rabbit model. We concluded that although the use of tissue plasminogen activator in our rabbit model of traumatic hyphema significantly improved clearance of blood from the anterior chamber, the remaining clot was of such size that the clinical benefit was questionable. 
Diagnosis and treatment of cranial neuralgias. Both medical and surgical therapies may be used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Ordinarily, the treatment is medical; however, if a response to drugs is not forthcoming, or if the patient becomes toxic while taking medications or refuses to abide by an appropriate medical program, then surgical consultation should be obtained and the appropriate operation performed. The form and type of neurosurgical procedure will probably depend to a considerable extent on the expertise of the neurosurgeon and his training. Generally, in the elderly, the simplest procedure should be attempted first. It may be necessary to employ both medical and surgical procedures in the individual patient. The medical drug of first choice is carbamazepine. Atypical facial neuralgia is a general term used to cover a variety of head and face pains that are poorly defined and that may not deserve separate clinical status. The pathogenesis of the atypical facial neuralgias is uncertain, and multiple causation seems likely. Search for local inflammatory pathology, neoplasms, vasomotor phenomena, and depressive symptoms is indicated. Treatment should be guided by the findings. 
Emergency department echocardiography in the diagnosis and therapy of cardiac tamponade. A 44-year-old male presented to the emergency department in shock with jugular venous distension and upper chest cyanosis. Superior vena cava syndrome was ruled out by computed tomography (CT scan). However, a large pericardial effusion was found on CT scan and confirmed by sonography. Pericardial tamponade was diagnosed by emergency physicians and sonography-guided pericardiocentesis was performed with marked improvement in symptomatology. 
Interval report of a phase I-II study utilizing multiple modalities in the treatment of invasive bladder cancer. A bladder-sparing trial. Clinicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital have used two cycles of methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine (MCV) before radiotherapy and cisplatin in 53 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Eleven patients did not complete the protocol, but overall, the toxicity was not formidable. Of the total patients accessioned, 34 are alive. Of the 34 patients in the series who completed the full treatment protocol, the estimated survival rate at 54 months is 77%. This interim analysis suggests that the treatment is achieving at least limited success in saving lives and bladders. 
Nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill: product of aspiration or translocation? OBJECTIVE: To examine the possibility that nosocomial pneumonias might be caused by the translocation of enteric bacteria and their toxins. DESIGN: Prospectively collected previous database was examined by logistic regression analysis. SETTING: University medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-two ICU patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The best stand-alone predictors for nosocomial pneumonia were bleeding from stress ulceration (p less than .001), the severity of illness present (p less than .001), and intramucosal acidosis in the stomach (p = .023), a metabolic indication of mucosal ischemia. Mechanical ventilation (p = .038) and the administration of antacids/cimetidine (p = .054) were also of stand-alone predictive value, but did not significantly improve the best predictive model for nosocomial pneumonia derived from the severity of illness present and the intramucosal pH in the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ischemic mucosal injury and its associated translocation of enteric bacteria and toxins might be more important in the pathogenesis of nosocomial pneumonia in the critically ill than the aspiration of contaminated nasopharyngeal secretions. 
Unsuspected uveal melanoma diagnosed after cataract extraction. Four cases of unsuspected uveal melanoma diagnosed after cataract extraction were found in a review of the records of enucleation specimens processed at our centre between 1974 and 1988. Similarities among the four cases included disparity in loss of visual acuity, unilateral angle-closure glaucoma, asymmetric cataract formation, inability to view the fundus and rapid flattening of the anterior chamber, with difficult closure at the time of surgery. Uveal melanoma should be suspected in any cataract patient presenting with one or more of these atypical clinical findings, and complete investigation, including A-scan and B-scan ultrasonography, is indicated. 
Evolving experience with thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair at a single institution. Fifty-seven patients underwent repair of atherosclerotic thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms between 1978 and 1990. Five patients had urgent surgery for rupture. The 30-day operative mortality rate for the entire group was 18% (10 patients). Before July 1987, 19 patients (group 1) were operated on by use of a technique previously described. In these earlier patients the peritoneum was routinely entered, the diaphragm was divided radially, and no heparin was given. Among patients in group 1 there was a 30-day operative mortality rate of 42% (8 patients), and morbidity included myocardial infarction 4 (21%), respiratory failure 9 (47%), renal failure 12 (63%), bleeding requiring reoperation 4 (21%), and intestinal ischemia 3 (16%). Since July 1987 a standardized approach to all elective thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms has been used in 38 patients (group 2). This method uses a left thoracoabdominal incision, circumferential division of the hemidiaphragm, retronephric totally extraperitoneal aortic exposure, single lung anesthesia, full heparinization, the graft inclusion technique, and liberal use of visceral endarterectomy. Patients in group 2 sustained a 30-day operative mortality rate of 5% (2 patients) and morbidity included myocardial infarction 2 (5%), respiratory failure 10 (26%), renal failure 11 (29%), bleeding requiring reoperation 1 (3%), paraplegia 6 (16%), and paraparesis 4 (11%). Modern surgery for repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm results in acceptably low operative mortality rates. Spinal cord ischemia remains an unresolved source of morbidity. 
Coronary restenosis: what have we learned from angiography? Coronary restenosis remains a major problem for interventional cardiology not only by virtue of its frequency, but also because of the current inability to prevent it. Symptomatic status and non-invasive evaluation have been used to study restenosis, but both lack specificity and sensitivity, particularly in patients with multivessel disease. Angiography remains the reference standard. Several arbitrary definitions have been used, some related to visual estimates of coronary stenosis and others to quantitative angiographic techniques. In another approach, linear modeling is used to assess minimal luminal diameter of lesions on restudy. Although angiographic studies have been essential in the study of restenosis, questions concerning the underlying mechanism and pathophysiology remain. The development of animal models that closely resemble human restenosis should allow evaluation of pathophysiologic mechanisms and development of new strategies to prevent the problem. 
Monoclonality in B cell lymphoma detected in paraffin wax embedded sections using the polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to develop a simple technique for detecting monoclonality at the DNA level in B lymphocyte populations in formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded material. Sections were dewaxed and dehydrated, and the DNA was extracted by boiling in water for 45 minutes. A semi-nested PCR was performed to amplify the V-D-J region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. The product was electrophoresed and viewed under ultraviolet light after ethidium bromide staining. Specimens from 26 B cell lymphomas produced a monoclonal band in 24 cases and no amplification in two cases; monoclonality was specific for this disorder. Specimens from seven T cell lymphomas produced no amplification; specimens from nine reactive nodes produced a broad smear of polyclonal material; and specimens from 12 cases of carcinoma produced either no amplification or polyclonal material. As detection of monoclonality is strongly suggestive of neoplastic disease, this technique is likely to be of value in routine diagnosis, because of its speed, simplicity, and applicability to fixed, embedded material. 
Infection of the central nervous system due to Acanthamoeba. It is well established that Acanthamoeba castellanii, Acanthamoeba culbertsoni, Acanthamoeba polyphaga, and probably other species of free-living amebas are virulent opportunists capable of producing disease in humans and animals. Human infections involving brain, eyes, skin, and lungs have been reported from all continents. Central nervous system (CNS) infection due to Acanthamoeba species usually occurs in chronically ill, debilitated individuals, some of them receiving immunosuppressive therapy or taking broad-spectrum antibiotics. The disease runs a protracted, insidious clinical course and is known as granulomatous amebic encephalitis. Histopathologically, Acanthamoeba species may produce a multifocal, chronic, or subacute granulomatous encephalitis, with trophozoites and cysts present in CNS lesions. The portal of entry of the amebas into the CNS is probably the respiratory tract or a skin lesion, and the organisms reach the CNS by hematogenous spread. As of 1 January 1989, about 50 cases of granulomatous amebic encephalitis had been reported worldwide, 27 in the United States alone. 
Phase II trial of interferon gamma and monoclonal antibody 17-1A in pancreatic cancer: biologic and clinical effects. Thirty patients with advanced measurable pancreatic adenocarcinoma were entered onto a phase II trial with recombinant interferon gamma (Biogen, Cambridge, MA; 10(6) U/m2 daily for 4 days) and monoclonal antibody (Mab) 17-1A (Centocor, Malvern, PA; 150 mg in autologous leukocytes on days 2, 3, and 4 following interferon infusion). The effect of a single interferon gamma treatment on natural and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), Fc receptor occupancy by antibody, and human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression on monocytes and lymphocytes was also studied. Toxicity was modest and generally limited to grade I to II fever, nausea and vomiting, and hepatotoxicity. Five patients were considered to be nonassessable for response. Of the 25 assessable patients, one objective response (complete remission for a duration of 4 months) was observed. Stable disease for 2 months or greater was noted in nine patients. The median survival for the group was 5 months. Analysis of cytotoxicity data obtained prior to treatment showed reduced natural cytotoxic activity in these patients compared with normal volunteers. A significant improvement in natural cytotoxic activity to normal levels occurred within 24 hours following the interferon gamma infusion. This was also associated with augmented antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Although HLA-DR expression was not increased on either monocytes or lymphocytes, an increased capacity of both lymphocytes and monocytes to bind Mab 17-1A was observed. In all in vitro assays of ADCC, the presence of antibody excess was associated with improved cytolytic activity. In spite of the favorable modulation of cytolytic activity and improved ability of effector cells to bind Mab, we failed to demonstrated adequate clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma using this dose and schedule of interferon gamma and Mab 17-1A. Future trials will focus on alternate schedules of Mab 17-1A with the hope of improving tumor antigen saturation and circulating levels of infused antibody. 
Temporalis myofascial flap for maxillofacial reconstruction. To date, the temporalis myofascial flap has been used only to a limited extent for reconstruction in the maxillofacial region. Experience gained with 26 temporalis flaps in reconstruction of tissue defects in the periorbital region, skull base, maxilla, and oral cavity is presented. Only one patient developed total necrosis of the flap; significant necrosis did not occur in any other patient. The anatomy of the flap and surgical technique are briefly presented. 
Life-threatening angioedema. Angioedema is a well-recognized edema involving the deeper layers of the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and mucosa. From July 1986 to July 1989 the authors have observed and treated 10 patients admitted to the Medical College of Virginia (MCV) Hospitals in Richmond, Virginia, with life-threatening angioedema as a complication of enalapril or captopril ingestion. Both drugs are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prescribed for antihypertensive activity and the ability to improve symptoms in patients with congestive heart failure. We describe the clinical symptoms, diagnosis, and management of these patients, as well as reasons for each occurrence. Sporadic reports of angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitor therapy have appeared in the literature. This represents the first time a significant series of patients from the same institution have encountered this complication over a short period of time, suggesting that the complication may be much more common than has been thought. 
Annular atrophic lichen planus. We describe a case of generalized, asymptomatic, chronic annular lichen planus. The centers of the large annular lesions were atrophic and had lost their elasticity. Histologic examination revealed an absence of elastic fiber in the center. Electron microscopy revealed fragmented elastic fibers. Examination of early lesions showed that elastolysis had already begun in the heavy cellular infiltration. We conclude that the annular configuration resulted from the elastolytic activity of the inflammatory cells with the formation of foci of localized acquired cutis laxa. 
Effect of inspired oxygen concentration on the incidence of desaturation in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The effect of inspired oxygen concentration on the incidence of desaturation was studied in two groups of patients (n = 32 and 31) during total hip replacement. During insertion of acrylic bone cement, those patients receiving an inspired fractional oxygen concentration (FIO2) of 0.5 had less desaturation (3%) than those receiving an FIO2 of 0.33 (34%). 
Rearrangement of the T-cell receptor delta chain gene in T-cell lymphomas with a mature phenotype. The configuration of the T-cell receptor (TCR) delta chain gene was assessed using restriction fragment analysis and the Southern blot technique in 39 T-cell lymphomas with a mature immunophenotype. The TCR delta gene was rearranged in four lymphomas although the gamma/delta TCR was not expressed in two cases studied. The TCR delta gene was the only TCR gene rearranged in two cases. Each lymphoma with TCR delta gene rearrangement had an aberrant T-cell immunophenotype and three cases were of the large cell anaplastic type. The TCR delta gene was deleted in 22 cases and was in the germline configuration in 13 lymphomas. Deletion of the TCR delta gene was characteristic of mycosis fungoides, adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus positive), and Lennert's lymphoma, and was not identified in angiocentric lymphomas. In eight cases with TCR delta deletion, however, a large number of polyclonal (presumably reactive) T cells were present and, in these lymphomas, the authors could not determine if TCR delta gene deletion occurred in the polyclonal T cells, the neoplastic cells, or both cell populations. The authors conclude that the TCR delta gene is usually deleted in mature T-cell lymphomas, as would be expected in alpha/beta TCR T cells. However, TCR delta gene rearrangement is detectable in approximately 10% of cases. Analysis of this locus may be useful diagnostically, as it occasionally may be the only molecular marker of clonality in mature T-cell lymphomas T-cell receptor delta chain gene rearrangement also is found most often in lymphomas of the large cell anaplastic type. 
Disposition of high-dose methotrexate in an obese cancer patient. The disposition of many drugs in obesity is altered, although little is known of the effect of obesity on the pharmacokinetics of anti-cancer drugs. In this report the authors describe the pharmacokinetics of high-dose methotrexate in an obese woman (184% ideal body weight) with osteosarcoma. For this patient, both the volume of distribution at steady-state (0.398 l/kg) and systemic clearance (0.0956 l/h/kg) of methotrexate were increased compared with values observed in adult patients with osteosarcoma. The terminal elimination half-life (9.29 hours) of methotrexate was similar to other reported values in adult patients, thus indicating that increases in methotrexate volume of distribution and clearance may offset each other in obesity. Based on the experience gained from this patient, the authors suggest that renal function and methotrexate serum concentrations should be monitored in obese patients receiving high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue. 
The clinical utility of maternal body mass index in pregnancy. To describe maternal body mass index and to compare the use of maternal weight and body mass index for risk assessment at the initial prenatal visit, 6270 gravid women who were consecutively delivered of infants were studied. Body mass index increased with advancing maternal age, parity, and advancing gestational age and was significantly greater in black women than in nonblack women. Risks for the development of adverse outcome associated with maternal obesity, including development of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia, were comparably predicted by either maternal weight or body mass index greater than 90th percentile. Maternal weight was as predictive of preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia as was body mass index when these factors were analyzed as continuous variables, whereas increasing body mass index was more predictive of gestational diabetes. The prediction of factors associated with low maternal weights, small-for-gestational-age birth, prematurity, low birth weight, and perinatal death was equivalent for maternal weight and body mass index that was less than 10th percentile. This study indicates that in the initial risk assessment of outcomes related to maternal weight, the calculation of maternal body mass index offers no advantage over simply weighing the patient. This finding contrasts with results in nonpregnant women. 
Glutethimide treatment of disabling action tremor in patients with multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury. Glutethimide has been used to control essential tremor. Its efficacy in the treatment of disabling cerebellar and rubral tremor was assessed in an open study of six patients with multiple sclerosis and two patients with traumatic brain injury. Functional and quantitative tremor severity was assessed before treatment and 7 to 14 days after a stable dose was achieved. Six of eight patients exhibited visible functional benefit from treatment with glutethimide; abstract testing results correlated well with functional status in most cases. Four patients chose to continue to receive medication. Controlled trials of glutethimide to compare its efficacy with that of other medications used in the treatment of action tremor are indicated. 
Aging, autonomic function, and the perception of angina. OBJECTIVE--To determine the effects of age and autonomic function on the perception of angina. DESIGN--Prospective evaluation of the relations between anginal perceptual threshold, autonomic function, and systolic blood pressure in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease. Statistical analysis was by non-parametric techniques. SETTING--Cardiology departments of a district general hospital and a post-graduate teaching centre. SUBJECTS--82 non-diabetic men with typical exertional angina and coronary artery disease confirmed by arteriography (n = 64) or a history of Q wave infarction (n = 18). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age, anginal perceptual threshold, autonomic function, and blood pressure. Anginal perceptual threshold was defined as the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST depression to the onset of angina during treadmill stress testing. Autonomic function was measured as the ratio of peak heart rate during the Valsalva manoeuvre to the minimum rate after release. RESULTS--Anginal perceptual threshold showed a weak but significant correlation with age, with older patients tending to have a longer interval between the onset of ST depression and the onset of angina. Comparison of patients in the upper and lower quartile age ranges showed a difference of 50 seconds between median threshold measurements. Blood pressure and heart rate responses to the Valsalva manoeuvre also correlated with age, but neither variable correlated with the anginal perceptual threshold. CONCLUSIONS--In non-diabetic men with coronary artery disease the perception of angina tends to deteriorate with advancing age. The mechanism is unclear but is not attributable solely to alterations in blood pressure or autonomic function. 
Colitis due to Histoplasma capsulatum in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. We present a case of colonic histoplasmosis in a young HIV antibody-positive homosexual male who presented with acute diarrhea. The diagnosis was made by flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsy which revealed organisms morphologically consistent with Histoplasma capsulatum, and was later confirmed by fungal culture of the biopsy specimens. At colonoscopy, skip areas with plaques, ulcers, and a pseudopolyp were observed. The colitis resolved endoscopically after a 6-wk course of intravenous amphotericin B, and the patient has had no recurrence of symptoms while on maintenance therapy with amphotericin B. However, the organisms continue to be noted on biopsies of normal-appearing areas in the rectum and sigmoid 5 months after diagnosis. Colonic involvement with H. capsulatum, an organism endemic to the Midwest, may be seen more frequently as the total number of cases of HIV-infected individuals increases in this region. 
A critical look at scheduled relaparotomy for secondary bacterial peritonitis. Scheduled relaparotomy is attracting interest as a means of treating intra-abdominal sepsis. It is the subject of several studies to evaluate its role in the management of peritoneal infection. However, indications for this procedure are not clear and current knowledge does not allow for adequate scientific evaluation. Many trials lack control groups and historical control groups cannot be evaluated on criteria, such as illness severity, concomitant health problems or even surgical technique. Indicators of outcome are generally described in insufficient detail; only death or survival are reported and important morbidity and resource utilization data are not included. A randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical trial using standardized techniques is necessary to determine the usefulness of scheduled relaparotomy performed on different patients. 
Acute pulpal-alveolar cellulitis syndrome. V. Apical closure of immature teeth by infection control: the importance of an endodontic seal with therapeutic factors. Part 2. During orthodontic treatment to promote eruption of maxillary and mandibular second bicuspids, a young male patient had a severe endodontic cellulitis of a mandibular bicuspid. Apexogenesis and resolution of the periapical lesion was achieved by infection control with nonspecific intracanal medication without calcium hydroxide, as stated by Das. A mild periodontal cellulitis occurred shortly thereafter and rapidly resolved. A second endodontic cellulitis, after apexogenesis without an endodontic seal, occurred shortly after completion of orthodontic treatment. This also quickly resolved, and the canal was effectively sealed. This case indicates the importance of an effective endodontic seal shortly after apexogenesis is induced by infection control. This report and others on the subject indicate that apexogenesis of nonvital permanent immature teeth by infection control is a predictable endodontic treatment procedure. 
Progress in cancer. Definite progress has been made against cancer since the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971. Physicians are giving increased attention to cancer prevention. The exciting changes in molecular biology provide increased knowledge about basic mechanisms in tumor growth and metastases. Detailed discussions of two common solid cancers--breast and colorectal--attest to continuing advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment. All of these augur well for further progress in oncology. Continued research, basic and clinical, is mandatory. 
Characterization of refractory period extension by transcardiac shock. BACKGROUND. To better understand the refractory period extension (RPE) produced by transcardiac shocks and its possible role in defibrillation, we measured RPE under various experimental conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using ventricular pacing in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, we characterized RPE in relation to the anatomic site of pacing, the local voltage gradient (LVG) produced by the shocks at the pacing site, and the pacing rate and pacing current used to make the measurements. We also determined if RPE persisted into the next refractory period after the shock and measured RPE at the end of 30-second episodes of acute ischemia to the pacing site, which were caused by occluding the left anterior descending artery. Each anatomic site tested showed RPE, which increased sharply with increasing LVG at lower levels but less sharply at higher LVG. The RPE versus LVG was approximated with an exponential curve that had an exponential constant of about 5-6 V/cm. At faster pacing rates, RPE occurred earlier in the refractory period but was unchanged when expressed as a percent increase of refractory period. RPE did not vary with the pacing current and was present only in the refractory period during which the shock was delivered. The RPE was not significantly altered by acute ischemia. These results show that transcardiac shocks selectively extend the refractory period of tissue proportional to the LVG and the timing of the shock in the refractory period. They are consistent with the concept that RPE prevents depolarization from tissue directly excited by a shock from propagating to tissue that was refractory to that same shock. CONCLUSIONS. The insensitivity of RPE to short ischemic episodes and the presence of RPE at increased activation rates suggest that RPE might exist under conditions of fibrillation and be a major determinant of the success or failure of defibrillation. 
A prospective study of maturity-onset diabetes mellitus and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in women. We examined the relationship of maturity-onset clinical diabetes mellitus with the subsequent incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke, total cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in a cohort of 116,177 US women who were 30 to 55 years of age and free of known coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer in 1976. During 8 years of follow-up (889 255 person-years), we identified 338 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 111 coronary deaths, 259 strokes, 238 cardiovascular deaths, and 1349 deaths from all causes. Diabetes was associated with a markedly increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (age-adjusted relative risk [RR] = 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3 to 8.4), ischemic stroke (RR = 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3 to 9.0), total cardiovascular mortality (RR = 6.3; 95% CI, 4.6 to 8.6), and all-cause mortality (RR = 3.0; 95% CI, 2.5 to 3.7). A major independent effect of diabetes persisted in multivariate analyses after simultaneous control for other known coronary risk factors (for these end points, RR [95% CI] = 3.1 [2.3 to 4.2], 3.0 [1.6 to 5.7], 3.0 [1.9 to 4.8], and 1.9 [1.4 to 2.4], respectively). The absolute excess coronary risk due to diabetes was greater in the presence of other risk factors, including cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. These prospective data indicate that maturity-onset clinical diabetes is a strong determinant of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular mortality among middle-aged women. The adverse effect of diabetes is amplified in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, many of which are modifiable. 
Acute effects of pulsatile levodopa administration on central dopamine pharmacodynamics. Inconsistencies in the response to individual levodopa doses occur in most patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). To investigate the possible development of acute tachyphylaxis, we evaluated the effects of repeated injections of intravenous levodopa in 10 PD patients with motor fluctuations by administering, during a single day, a previously determined optimal levodopa dose repeatedly each time motor function returned to baseline. Peak antiparkinsonian response was lower by 20%, and peak plasma levodopa levels lower by 35% following the first dose compared with all subsequent doses. Neither peak dyskinesia scores nor the duration of motor response changed significantly with successive levodopa doses. These data suggest that pulsatile levodopa administration does not acutely alter dopamine receptor responsiveness, and that other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors contribute to the dose-to-dose variability in response to levodopa. 
The Edmonton injector: a simple device for patient-controlled subcutaneous analgesia. In a prospective open study we tested the Edmonton injector (EI), a device designed by our group for subcutaneous injection of narcotics. In 25 patients, the EI was used for patient-controlled analgesia (PCA); mean duration of treatment was 28 +/- 10 days. Mean equivalent daily dose of morphine was 160 +/- 85 mg. All patients found the EI safe and simple to operate. The main reason for discontinuation was death (10 cases) or return to oral narcotics (8 cases). In 20 patients who were admitted to the hospital and were too ill to learn PCA, the EI was used for regular s.c. administration by nurses. Narcotics were administered every 4 h and extra doses were administered on a 'PRN' basis. Waiting time for a 'PRN' dose in 8 patients before starting the EI was 18 +/- 7 min; after the EI was started, it was 3 +/- 4 min (P less than 0.01). We conclude that the EI is safe, effective and inexpensive, and that it will be particularly useful in smaller hospitals and developing countries. 
Kinetics of D-xylose absorption in patients with human immunodeficiency virus enteropathy. D-Xylose absorption was studied in 12 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or advanced AIDS-related complex who had had diarrhea for more than 8 weeks, averaged an 11% (range, 3% to 21%) body weight loss during the previous 6 months, and had had negative stool examinations for enteric pathogens. Patients were evaluated by duodenal aspiration and biopsy and received both 25 gm oral and 10 gm intravenous doses of D-xylose. Kinetic analysis of D-xylose absorption was characterized by an absorption rate constant (ka) and a rate constant (ko) reflecting nonabsorptive loss. Extent of D-xylose absorption averaged 18.4% +/- 9.3% (+/- SD) in the 12 patients (normal greater than 60%). Percentage of weight loss during the previous 6 months was negatively correlated with ka (r = -0.69; p = 0.018) in the 11 patients in whom this parameter was reduced but was not correlated with either ko or extent of D-xylose absorption. In these patients with human immunodeficiency virus enteropathy, ka was reduced out of proportion to the minor histologic changes present in the duodenal biopsy specimens. 
Strawberry hemangioma of infancy: early definitive treatment with an argon laser. This report documents the successful treatment of a hemangioma (strawberry hemangioma) at 5 weeks of age with the argon laser. The natural course of strawberry hemangioma of infancy is well known. It begins as a very small spot and develops very rapidly within the first few weeks of life. Many grow to a very large size and produce significant morbidity. It is logical to assume that if these were ablated early, the life cycle could be aborted. The patient of this case study developed two spots that appeared to be typical evolving hemangiomas. One was treated and disappeared. The other was not treated and evolved into a typical strawberry hemangioma that eventually involuted. This would indicate that early treatment holds some promise. 
Cytomegalovirus ileitis presenting as massive rectal bleeding in infancy. Two Zambian infants presented with massive rectal bleeding caused by cytomegalovirus ileitis. The first was seropositive for HIV and the second seronegative, though her mother was seropositive. Both infants died. 
Occult metastatic neck disease: detection with US and US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology. The authors performed a prospective study of the value of ultrasonography (US) and US-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) for assessment of N0 lesions in the neck. Preoperative US was performed in 107 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, who underwent 132 elective neck dissections. During the US examination of the last 54 patients, who underwent 70 elective neck dissections, US-guided FNAC was performed. US alone was found to be an unreliable method for detecting occult lymph node metastasis; the accuracy never exceeded 70% (93 of 132), with a sensitivity of 60% (32 of 53) and a specificity of 77% (61 of 79). In contrast, US-guided FNAC had an accuracy of 89% (62 of 70), a sensitivity of 76% (25 of 33), and a specificity of 100% (37 of 37). Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of US-guided FNAC for the assessment of the N0 neck, this modality may play an important role in directing treatment of these patients in the future. 
Electrocardiographic findings in a patient with pure septal infarction. The electrocardiogram in a 65 year old man in whom pure septal infarction had been produced by occlusion of the septal branch during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty showed that this had led to the disappearance of septal Q waves and reciprocal ST segment depression in the inferior leads. 
Acute, subacute, and chronic myocardial infarction: quantitative analysis of gadolinium-enhanced MR images. The value of gadolinium enhancement to enable detection of infarcted myocardium at T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was assessed in 84 patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Five healthy subjects served as controls. All patients underwent MR imaging before and 20 minutes after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Contrast enhancement of normal myocardium varied 7% +/- 4 after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Mean intensity ratio after gadolinium enhancement in group 1 (imaging less than 1 week after AMI), group 2 (imaging 1-3 weeks after AMI), and group 3 (imaging 3-6 weeks after AMI) was significantly higher than before gadolinium enhancement. In group 4 (imaging more than 6 weeks after AMI), no significant difference was observed. After gadolinium enhancement, the intensity ratio was abnormally increased in 82% of the MR examinations in group 1, in 62% of group 2, in 58% of group 3, and in 12% of group 4. Gadolinium enhancement improved visualization of myocardial infarction at MR imaging up to 6 weeks after onset of symptoms and had a maximal effect within 1 week after AMI. 
Analyses of 200 lymphadenectomies in patients with penile carcinoma. From 1972 to 1987, 200 consecutive lymphadenectomies were performed in 112 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis. A Gibson incision provided exposure of the iliac and inguinal lymph nodes with a low morbidity rate (5% flap necrosis, 15% wound infection, 16% lymphedema and 9% lymphocele). The controversy surrounding the necessity of iliac lymphadenectomy is discussed, since 305 iliac lymph nodes examined did not have metastatic invasion. 
Relationship between the onset of dysmenorrhea and histologic findings in adenomyosis. An attempt was made to evaluate the relationship between histologic findings of adenomyosis and onset of dysmenorrhea. Thirty-four cases of histologically diagnosed adenomyosis were investigated in this study. One large sample cut along the longitudinal axis was made and examined to evaluate the histologic parameters and CA 125 levels. Dysmenorrhea was classified into grade I (absent or mild) and grade II (severe). Localization of adenomyosis was divided into type I, adenomyosis continuous from the surface endometrium (29 cases), and type II, adenomyosis present on the serous side of the uterus and not continuous from the surface endometrium (five cases). We made type I adenomyosis, which included 13 cases of grade I and 16 cases of grade II, the focus of our investigation. The parameters that correlated with dysmenorrhea were the number of islands of adenomyosis and glands, distance of invasion, relative rate of invasion, and CA 125 levels. The differences between grades I and II were apparent in the frequency distribution tables, with dysmenorrhea occurring at invasion rates of 80% and greater. 
Immunohistochemical detection of renal carbonic anhydrase of patients with recurrent urolithiasis. In renal exploratory excisions the isoenzyme C of the carbonic anhydrase was detected in 51 operative treated patients with recurrent urolithiasis and in 6 patients with ren mobilis or stenosis of the ureteral pelvic junction by using the immunohistochemical PAP-method. In the distal tubules and collecting ducts there is an alternating occurrence of cells with small and those with strong reactivity. This correlates with the distribution of mean or principal (P-, small reaction) and intercalated (I-, strong reaction) cells. The number of carbonic anhydrase rich cells and the degree of their cytoplasmic reaction to this enzyme seem to correlate with the ability of the urine to acidify. The patients were divided into four groups according to the mean urine pH estimated for a period of two weeks. The third group with predominantly acid urine (pH less than 5.8) showed a significantly increased number of carbonic anhydrase rich cells (mean = 63% +/- 6, n = 18) as compared to the first group (controls) without urolithiasis and normal urine (pH 5.8-6.8, mean = 46% +/- 8, n = 6) or the second group with urolithiasis and normal urine (pH 5.8-6.8, mean = 46% +/- 8, n = 28). The fourth group with predominant alkaline urine (pH greater than 6.8) showed a significantly decreased number of intercalated cells (mean = 42% +/- 16, n = 5) in comparison to the third group. Indeed, the difference with the control group is not significant but the cytoplasmic reaction of I-cells decreases distinctly in comparison to all other groups. 
Acute traumatic midbrain hemorrhage: experimental and clinical observations with CT. Traumatic brain stem hemorrhage (TBH) after blunt head impact is an uncommon injury and has historically been associated with high mortality. Retrospective clinical review identified 64 patients with TBH admitted during a 5-year period. Complete imaging and clinical records for 45 of these patients demonstrated that TBH could be categorized into three groups. The most frequent site of hemorrhage, in 31 (69%) of 45 patients (group 1), was the midline rostral anterior brain stem, posterior to the interpeduncular cistern, and this injury was associated with a 71% survival rate. This pattern was also associated with a predominantly anterior site of head and/or face impact. Eight (18%) patients (group 2) had miscellaneous foci of acute brain stem hemorrhage with seven (88%) surviving. Six (13%) patients (group 3) had brain stem hemorrhage associated with transtentorial herniation and brain stem compression, with 100% mortality. Experimental findings in a canine model and clinical results indicate that the anterior rostral midbrain is a common site of TBH and appears to arise from sudden craniocaudal displacement of the brain at impact. Survival is unexpected high with this location of traumatic midbrain hemorrhage. 
Intrinsic vasculature of the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve--implications for site of lesion in Bell's palsy. Recent studies of the intrinsic vasculature of the cat facial nerve have demonstrated relatively poor blood supply to the labyrinthine segment. In this study, the intrinsic vasculature of the human facial nerve was systematically evaluated in 25 temporal bones and three fresh cadaver nerves. Cross-sectional vessel counts were obtained for the labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments. Capillary densities for each segment were derived from these data. The labyrinthine segment of the human facial nerve, like that in the cat, contains fewer and smaller intrinsic blood vessels than do the mastoid and tympanic segments. This may indicate that the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve may be more vulnerable to ischemic damage. In conjunction with the previously demonstrated narrowness of the labyrinthine fallopian canal, these findings support the contention that the labyrinthine segment is a likely site of lesion in Bell's palsy. 
Thallium-201 scintigraphy after intravenous infusion of adenosine compared with exercise thallium testing in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease Adenosine is an endogenously produced compound that has significant effects as a coronary and systemic vasodilator. Previous studies suggest that intravenous infusion of adenosine, coupled with thallium-201 scintigraphy, may have specific value as a noninvasive means of evaluating coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of adenosine thallium testing with that of standard exercise thallium testing. One hundred subjects were studied with exercise thallium imaging and thallium imaging after adenosine infusion, including 47 with angiographically proved coronary artery disease and 53 control subjects. The overall sensitivity of the thallium procedures was 81% for the exercise study and 83% for the adenosine study (p = NS); the specificity was 74% for the exercise study and 75% for the adenosine study (p = NS). The diagnostic accuracy of the exercise study was 77% and that of the adenosine study was 79%. Ninety-four percent of subjects had an adverse effect due to the adenosine infusion; however, most of these effects were mild and well tolerated. All adverse effects abated within 30 to 45 s of the termination of the study, consistent with the very brief half-life of the agent. Thus, thallium-201 scintigraphy after intravenous infusion of adenosine has a diagnostic value similar to that of exercise thallium testing for evaluation of coronary artery disease. Adenosine thallium testing may be particularly useful in evaluating patients unable to perform treadmill exercise testing. 
Retroperitoneal fibrosis. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is idiopathic in two thirds of cases and is found most commonly as an isolated fibrotic plaque centered over the lower lumbar spine and entrapping one or both ureters. It has been postulated that the fibrosis in the idiopathic cases results from a hypersensitivity reaction to antigens leaking into the retroperitoneum from atheromatous plaques in the aorta or common iliac arteries. In the remaining one third of cases, causes include ergot-derivative drugs, retroperitoneal hemorrhage or urine extravasation, and a desmoplastic response to a variety of tumors. In up to 15% of cases, associated fibrotic processes are found elsewhere in the body. Although the disease is imaged best with CT or MR, neither of these techniques can be used to differentiate benign from malignant plaques. Histologically, the disease is characterized in its early stages by inflammatory cells and edema in a loose collagen network. The mature plaque is composed of dense fibrous tissue with minimal cellular infiltration. This progression is important as it influences MR signal characteristics. 
Influence of the plasma protein concentration on renal function. 1. The effect of the plasma protein concentration on renal function remains controversial. Most, but not all, experimental studies suggest that a reduced plasma protein concentration perfusing the kidney may reduce tubular sodium reabsorption. Hypoproteinaemic disease states are usually associated with sodium retention, which is not always volume-dependent. 2. We induced a 21% and 24% reduction in plasma total protein and plasma albumin, respectively, in unanaesthetized sheep by acute extracorporeal plasmapheresis. Arterial pressure did not change, and changes in circulatory volume were minimised by infusion of crystalloid to maintain pulmonary artery occlusion pressure, measured using a Swann-Ganz pulmonary artery catheter. 3. After plasmapheresis, there was no significant change in creatinine clearance, sodium excretion, plasma renin activity or urinary kallikrein excretion. 4. After plasmapheresis, there was no significant reduction in plasma osmolality, increase in urine osmolality and fall in free water clearance. 5. The results suggest that in the absence of detectable changes in circulating volume or arterial pressure, acute hypoproteinaemia is associated with significant changes in renal water handling, but has no direct effect on sodium excretion or on renal release of renin and kallikrein. 
Effect of high-dose methylprednisolone and U74006F on eicosanoid synthesis after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats. Free radicals and lipid peroxidation of membrane fatty acids are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of arterial vasospasm and the physiopathologic patterns of neuronal damage after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We have evaluated the effects of treatment with either high-dose methylprednisolone every 8 hours or a single dose of U74006F on the temporal profile of ex vivo synthesis of four selected eicosanoids in brain slices after experimental induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats. Prostaglandins D2 and E2, prostacyclin and leukotriene C4 levels were determined by radioimmunoassay after 1-hour incubation of the brain slices. The synthesis of prostaglandin D2 and 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha at 48 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage was significantly higher when compared to sham-operated animals (p = 0.01); prostaglandin E2 release was significantly enhanced at 6 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage (p = 0.01). The release of the lipoxygenase metabolite was significantly enhanced at 1, 6, and 48 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage induction. Both treatment regimens significantly reduced the ex vivo synthesis of prostaglandin D2, prostaglandin E2, and leukotriene C4 at 1, 6, and 48 hours after subarachnoid hemorrhage, whereas the effects on 6-ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha synthesis differed in the two treatment groups. U74006F enhanced the synthesis of prostacyclin metabolite in the early phase after subarachnoid hemorrhage, and high-dose methylprednisolone reduced the increasing synthesis at 48 hours. A strict comparison between the two treatments was not possible because of the different modalities of administration. However, these data suggest that the antioxidant effect of single-dose treatment with U74006F influenced the early and delayed effects on enzymatic lipid peroxidation, whereas the effects of methylprednisolone administration every 8 hours were more significant in the delayed phase. 
Brain and ocular abnormalities in infants with in utero exposure to cocaine and other street drugs. We describe 10 infants with developmental delay and congenital cerebral anomalies who were found to have had in utero exposure to vasoactive drugs. Nine infants had ophthalmological abnormalities; these included strabismus, nystagmus, and/or hypoplastic optic discs. Six mothers used cocaine, one used cocaine and heroin, one used only heroin, one used amphetamine, and one used phenylpropanolamine. Each of these cerebral anomalies (agenesis of the corpus callosum, septo-optic dysplasia, schizencephaly, hydranencephaly, congenital hydrocephalus, porencephaly, and cerebral infarctions) can be attributed to insults at different stages of development. There appears to be a relationship between the time of prenatal drug exposure and the type of cerebral anomaly, evoking malformations, disruptions, or fetal strokes. Since many or possibly all of these anomalies are thought to have a vascular origin, it seems appropriate to implicate prenatal exposure to vasoactive drugs. 
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome of the lower limbs in renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporin A. In a 36-month period, 240 patients at our institution received kidney transplants from cadaver donors. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was used as the initial immunosuppressive therapy. Seven patients (5 men and 2 women) developed severe pain, periarticular soft tissue swelling with no effusion, and vasomotor changes in affected areas. Although articular mobility was conserved, most of the patients had great difficulty in walking. A patchy osteoporotic pattern was seen radiographically and increased uptake of 99mtechnetium with a periarticular distribution in the clinically affected areas were found. All of these symptoms and radiographic and scintigraphic signs are compatible with definite reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS). Articular symptoms began within 3 months after kidney transplantation in all patients; all but 1 patient had plasma CsA levels greater than 200 ng/ml at that time. When the dosage of CsA was reduced, there was concomitant improvement in the RSDS, which appeared when the plasma CsA levels declined to less than 200 ng/ml. The mean duration of the clinical symptoms of RSDS was 8 months. We believe RSDS should be added to the list of complications that may appear in kidney transplant patients who receive CsA treatment. 
Coronary hemodynamic effects of atrial natriuretic peptide in humans. Studies of the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide on the coronary circulation have yielded conflicting results in animals and have not been fully investigated in human subjects. To further characterize the direct coronary hemodynamic actions of atrial natriuretic peptide in humans and to assess the safety of its administration in patients with coronary artery disease, incremental doses of synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide and nitroglycerin were infused into the left coronary artery in 14 patients, 11 of whom had coronary artery disease. Both agents caused dose-related increases in total coronary sinus blood flow. The largest dose of atrial natriuretic peptide given to all patients (100 micrograms) increased mean coronary sinus blood flow from 127 +/- 7 to 149 +/- 9 ml/min (p less than 0.05) and decreased coronary vascular resistance from 0.93 +/- 0.07 to 0.81 +/- 0.05 mm Hg/ml per min (p less than 0.05); mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by this dose of atrial natriuretic peptide. The greatest changes in coronary sinus blood flow (+25%) and coronary vascular resistance (-18%) after atrial natriuretic peptide administration occurred in the patients with coronary artery disease and no other associated cardiovascular disease. The maximal effects of atrial natriuretic peptide were similar to those of nitroglycerin, and no untoward effects were observed. Thus, atrial natriuretic peptide is a direct coronary vasodilator in humans. Its maximal dose effects are similar to those of nitroglycerin and were well tolerated in this small group of patients. The physiologic importance and therapeutic potential of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with coronary artery disease merit further investigation. 
Southern blot analysis in a case of Richter's syndrome. Evidence for a postrearrangement heavy chain gene deletion associated with the altered phenotype. Richter's syndrome (RS) can be defined as the emergence of an aggressive lymphoma in patients suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The authors performed immunophenotypic and Southern blot analysis of the peripheral blood and tissue specimen of a patient with RS. Using immunoperoxidase and immunogold-silver staining techniques and a panel of monoclonal antibodies, the authors found that the large cells characteristic of RS showed an altered immunophenotype as compared with the CLL cells and did not express mu heavy chain. Southern blot analysis revealed identical kappa light chain rearrangements in both tumoral cell populations consistent with a common clonal origin. Using the JH probe and several restriction enzymes, the authors also found evidence for a postrearrangement deletion of the heavy chain mu gene. These findings suggest that in this case of RS, a deletion of the heavy chain mu gene resulted in loss of mu expression by the larger cells that were characteristic of RS and was associated with their altered phenotype. 
Development of a highly efficient expression cDNA cloning system: application to oncogene isolation. We developed an expression cDNA cloning system capable of generating high-complexity libraries with unidirectionally inserted cDNA fragments and allowing efficient plasmid rescue. As an application of this system, a cDNA library was constructed from an NIH 3T3 transformant induced by mouse hepatocellular carcinoma DNA. Transfection of NIH 3T3 cells by the library DNA led to the detection of several transformed foci from which identical plasmids with transforming ability could be rescued. Structure and sequence analysis of the cDNA clones revealed that the oncogene was created by recombinational events involving an unknown gene and the mouse homologue of the B-raf protooncogene. Detection of the same genetic rearrangement in independent primary transformants implied that generation of the oncogene occurred within the tumor rather than during DNA transfection or cDNA library construction. The high frequency at which clones were identified and the large sizes of some of the transforming cDNA inserts isolated suggest wide applicability of this mammalian expression cloning system for isolating cDNAs of biologic interest. 
Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes in liver tissue of patients with chronic liver diseases by flow cytometry. Immunological factors are important in the pathogenesis of a spectrum of hepatobiliary diseases. To characterize the nature of specific immunological responses in liver disease, we determined lymphocyte changes in liver tissue and in blood using flow cytometry. A total of 113 liver biopsy specimens was collected from patients with the following diseases: 19 chronic hepatitis B; 39 chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis; 27 alcoholic liver disease; 10 hepatic malignancy; 8 autoimmune hepatitis; 6 fatty liver and 4 primary biliary cirrhosis. The lymphocytes were isolated from the liver biopsy specimens by mechanical and enzymatic methods. The lymphocyte yield was 7,901 +/- 575 cells/mg of liver tissue. The viability of lymphocytes was 97.7% +/- 0.3%. Lymphocytes were stained with four pairs of two-color mixed fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies, including T4-T8 (CD4/CD8), T11-B1 (CD2-CD20), NKH1-T8 (CD56-CD8), IL-2R1-T11 (CD25-CD2), and the ratios were determined by an Epics Profile flow cytometer. Immunophenotyping of lymphocytes in whole blood samples was simultaneously analyzed. Variability in lymphocyte yield and different patterns of lymphocyte subsets were found in the liver biopsy specimens. The yields of lymphocytes from patients with chronic non-A, non-B and autoimmune hepatitis were highest, and the lowest yield was from patients with fatty liver. Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, fatty liver and hepatic malignancy had relatively high ratios of CD4/CD8, CD56/CD8 and CD25/CD2; whereas patients with chronic hepatitis B, autoimmune hepatitis and non-A, non-B hepatitis had lower ratios of CD4/CD8, CD56/CD8 and CD25/CD2. No difference in lymphocyte ratios between the patients with cirrhotic and noncirrhotic alcoholic liver disease was found. 
Relationship between esophageal varices and azygos vein evaluated by cineportography. The relationship between esophageal varices and the azygos vein, which is generally considered to drain the major part of the variceal blood flow, was evaluated by percutaneous transhepatic cineportography in 35 patients with portal hypertension. We classified the patients into three groups. Those patients in whom most of the variceal blood drained into the azygos vein were designated the azygos-type group (n = 18). Those in whom most of the blood flowed into the brachiocephalic venous system were defined as the cervical-type group (n = 5), and those in whom the varices were drained by both the azygos vein and the brachiocephalic venous system were called the combined-type group (n = 12). Highly developed esophageal varices were recognized endoscopically in all patients in the combined-type and cervical-type groups, whereas some of the patients in the azygos-type group had less well-developed varices. In the azygos-type group, a tendency for the varices to be more severe as their drainage into the azygos vein became more cephalad was noted. Evaluation of the drainage of esophageal varices was considered useful not only for obtaining full comprehension of the significance of the azygos vein but also for assessing the suitability for sclerotherapy. Percutaneous transhepatic cineportography was useful for this purpose because it enables visualization of even the most minute amounts of blood flow. 
Prospective quality-of-life analysis after palliative photoablation for the treatment of malignant dysphagia. Forty patients were treated for the relief of malignant dysphagia by using laser photoablation. Their quality of life was assessed before the start of treatment and at monthly intervals until death. Two methods were used, a physician's assessment (QL index) and a patient's self-assessment, the linear analogue self-assessment (LASA). There was significant correlation between assessments done at different times by different physicians (QL index rs, 0.786; P less than 0.001; LASA rs, 0.865; P less than 0.001). The correlation coefficient of the QL index and the LASA score with the patient's dysphagia grade was 0.459 and 0.336, respectively. The patient's swallowing ability, QL index, and LASA all were improved significantly at some time after laser therapy. The mean survival was 16 weeks with 58% of patients dying at home, 28% in the hospital, and 18% in a hospice. It was concluded that laser photoablation improves the overall quality of life in patients with malignant dysphagia. 
Intra-arterial streptokinase infusion in acute lower limb ischaemia. Between 1986 and 1988, 38 patients (29 men and nine women), median age 65 years (range 38-85 years), underwent local intra-arterial streptokinase therapy for acute lower limb ischaemia. Three patient groups were identified: 15 with acute on chronic ischaemia (group 1), 12 postangioplasty (group 2) and 11 postfemorodistal bypass (group 3). Distal arteriographic run-off was a significant discriminant between success and failure in group 1 (n = 15, chi 2 = 11.5, P = 0.001) and in the overall group (n = 38, chi 2 = 17.2, P less than 0.001). In group 2, four patients with good run-off had an unsuccessful outcome; this was due in all cases to technical problems (haemorrhage in two and intimal dissection in two). In group 3, two patients with good run-off had unsuccessful streptokinase infusions. In both cases the graft failed in the early postoperative period (less than 30 days). By contrast, the four patients whose grafts occluded after 30 days had successful streptokinase infusions and long-term graft patency was achieved by further surgery and balloon dilatation. In all groups, no patient with a poor run-off had a successful outcome following streptokinase administration. The role of local intra-arterial streptokinase therapy in the critically ischaemic limb remains controversial, but these results suggest that an adequate run-off is an important factor in the selection of patients for treatment. 
Why all placentas should be examined by a pathologist in 1990 Placental pathology is rarely a part of the training for either obstetrician or pathologist. As a result there has been confusion regarding the potential benefits of routine placental examination. These benefits include clarification of the causes of many adverse pregnancy outcomes, improvement of the risk assessment for future pregnancies, and ascertainment of newborn risk for long-term neurodevelopment sequelae. Information on placental abnormalities may reveal the presence of chronic fetal insults and allow their differentiation from acute (peripartum) stresses. Current methods of risk assessment fail to identify the majority of pregnancies that end in prematurity, stillbirth, growth retardation, or fetal distress. We suggest that placental pathology should be a routine component of obstetric-neonatal care. 
Multimodal therapy for the management of localized Ewing's sarcoma of pelvic and sacral bones: a report from the second intergroup study. A total of 59 eligible patients with localized Ewing's sarcoma of the pelvic and sacral bones were entered into a multimodal Intergroup Ewing's Sarcoma Study (IESS-II) (1978 to 1982) and compared with a historical control series of 68 patients entered into an earlier multimodal Intergroup Ewing's Sarcoma Study (IESS-I) (1973 to 1978). High-dose intermittent multiagent chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH], and dactinomycin) was given to all patients for 6 weeks before and for 70 weeks following local therapy. All patients who had a tumor biopsy or incomplete resection performed received a dose of 55 Gy to the tumor bed. With a median follow-up time of 5.5 years, two of 59 patients (3%) had a local recurrence, five patients (8%) had a local recurrence and metastases, and 17 patients (29%) developed metastases only. There was significant statistical evidence of an advantage in relapse-free survival (RFS) and survival (S) for patients on IESS-II versus IESS-I, P = .006 and P = .002, respectively. At 5 years, the comparison between IESS-II versus IESS-I was 55% versus 23% for RFS and 63% versus 35% for S. 
Ulcerated anogenital hemangioma of infancy. Ten female infants were referred for symptomatic hemangiomas in the anogenital area. (One had had steroid treatment prior to consultation.) The natural history of these lesions is well known. Virtually all will spontaneously involute over a period of years. However, the lesions reported were particularly troublesome because of repeated ulcerations and subsequent pain. Prior treatment had been local wound care with antibiotic ointment and Telfa-type dressings. After referral from a family practitioner or pediatrician, argon laser treatment was performed in an outpatient setting. Eight of the 10 patients were treated with local anesthesia, and 2 had general anesthesia. All lesions healed in 1 to 5 weeks. No patients referred during this period were excluded from this series. All who received treatment were included. All the lesions involuted following treatment. In our estimation, the final result is identical to what may be expected after spontaneous involution of an ulcerated or infected hemangioma. The major difference is that involution occurred in a few weeks in laser-treated patients rather than a period of months or years. Ulcerated hemangiomas of the anogenital area have significant morbidity that can be efficiently avoided with the use of argon laser therapy. Lesions of the anogenital area have a strong predilection for females. 
Barrett's esophagus. A continuing conundrum. Barrett's esophagus, a condition in which the distal esophagus is lined by columnar epithelium, is almost always caused by gastroesophageal reflux and often occurs in conjunction with a sliding hiatal hernia. Patients are typically white men in their 50s who smoke and drink, and they present with complaints of regurgitation, heartburn, and/or dysphagia. Endoscopic biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Complications, such as stricture, ulcer, dysplasia, and malignant degeneration, occur in many cases. Adenocarcinoma is the most serious complication. Medical treatment, including life-style changes as well as pharmacologic therapy, usually relieves symptoms and heals esophagitis, but when it fails, antireflux surgery is indicated. Patients without evidence of dysplasia should undergo endoscopy yearly; those with mild dysplasia require more frequent surveillance. If biopsies disclose severe dysplasia, esophagogastrectomy should be performed. 
Volunteer participation in feeding residents: training and supervision in a long-term care facility. The increasing number of residents in long-term care facilities who require full and partial assistance during meals has created a need for volunteer support to enhance the quality of life for residents. The correlation between dependence in eating and the existence of swallowing disorders and the risk of aspiration in persons with swallowing disorders suggests that training must be given to volunteers who feed residents. A formalized program for volunteer training and supervision was implemented at Coler Memorial Hospital, a long-term care facility. The program's development and benefits are outlined. Implementation of this program resulted in better training of volunteers, increased socialization, communication, and safety for patients during meals. 
Hyperthermia deaths in Finland in 1970-86. All cases in which hyperthermia had been determined as the basic cause of death during the period 1970-86 were collected from the records of the Central Statistical Office of Finland. Of the total of 230 cases, 228 were included in the present study; the two remaining victims died abroad, and no autopsy was performed in Finland. Most of the hyperthermia deaths occurred while the decedent was taking a sauna bath; most decedents were men aged 42-62 years. An increase in the total number of hyperthermia deaths, and of male victims, was noted from the beginning of the 1970s onward; the number of female victims remained at a relatively steady level throughout, with the exception of a slight rise in 1986. Acute alcohol consumption was detected in most of the victims; in some cases there was also a reference to chronic alcoholism or recent long-term heavy drinking. The findings suggest that in addition to the acute hazardous effect of ethanol on thermoregulatory mechanisms, the long-term consumption of alcohol may have promoted fatal hyperthermia in these subjects. 
The course of lymphocytic hypophysitis. A 27-year-old woman presented to our institution in her seventh month of pregnancy with complaints of headache and visual field disturbance. Workup revealed bitemporal hemianopia, a markedly enlarged pituitary gland on computed tomography scan, and biochemical evidence of partial hypopituitarism. At surgery, a biopsy specimen of the pituitary gland was taken revealing lymphocytic hypophysitis. The patient was treated with steroids and replacement doses of thyroid hormone. Visual fields improved postoperatively. A repeat computed tomography scan obtained 2 months after an uneventful pregnancy showed that her pituitary had regained normal size and contour. Over the next 9 months she had gradual recovery of all pituitary function. This case allowed us to follow and document the course of lymphocytic hypophysitis from its presentation as a macroadenoma with partial hypopituitarism to full recovery of both size and hormonal function of the pituitary. Lymphocytic hypophysitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pituitary mass or pituitary dysfunction presenting in pregnancy. In patients with suspected lymphocytic hypophysitis and a pituitary mass, a trial of steroids may be therapeutic. 
The Rex regulatory protein of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I binds specifically to its target site within the viral RNA. The Rex protein of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) was expressed in bacteria and partially purified. Rex was shown to bind in vitro specifically to an RNA sequence located in the 3' long terminal repeat of HTLV-I, named Rex-responsive element (RXRE). Rex also bound in vitro to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Rev-responsive element (RRE), while purified HIV-1 Rev protein did not bind to the RXRE. The binding results obtained in vitro are therefore in agreement with the nonreciprocal function of Rev and Rex in vivo. Rex binds specifically to both RRE and RXRE and activates expression in both HIV-1 and HTLV-I, while Rev binds to RRE and activates only HIV-1. Binding of Rex to RRE deletion mutants previously shown to lack either the Rev-responsive or the Rex-responsive portion suggested preferential binding of Rex to a distinct target within the RRE. These results demonstrated that Rex, like Rev, acts by binding to a specific RNA target. 
Twenty four hour heart rate variability: effects of posture, sleep, and time of day in healthy controls and comparison with bedside tests of autonomic function in diabetic patients. Heart rate variability was measured in 77 healthy controls and 343 diabetic patients by a count of the number of beat-to-beat differences greater than 50 ms in the RR interval during a 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiogram. In the healthy controls the lower 95% tolerance limits for total 24 hour RR interval counts were approximately 2000 at age 25, 1000 at 45, and 500 at 65 years. Six controls confined to bed after injury had normal 24 hour patterns of RR counts, while eight other controls showed loss of diurnal variation in both heart rate and RR counts during a period of sleep deprivation. RR counts in ten controls on and off night duty increased during sleep whenever it occurred. Nearly half (146) the 343 diabetic patients had abnormal 24 hour RR counts. The percentage of abnormal RR counts increased with increasing autonomic abnormality assessed by a standard battery of tests of cardiovascular autonomic function. A quarter of those with normal cardiovascular reflex tests had abnormal 24 hour RR counts. There were close correlations between 24 hour RR count results and the individual heart rate tests (r = 0.6). The assessment of cardiac parasympathetic activity by 24 hour RR counts was reliable. The diurnal variations in RR counts seen in the controls were probably related to sleep rather than either posture or time of day. The method was more sensitive than conventional tests of cardiovascular reflexes. 
Why all placentas should be examined by a pathologist in 1990 Placental pathology is rarely a part of the training for either obstetrician or pathologist. As a result there has been confusion regarding the potential benefits of routine placental examination. These benefits include clarification of the causes of many adverse pregnancy outcomes, improvement of the risk assessment for future pregnancies, and ascertainment of newborn risk for long-term neurodevelopment sequelae. Information on placental abnormalities may reveal the presence of chronic fetal insults and allow their differentiation from acute (peripartum) stresses. Current methods of risk assessment fail to identify the majority of pregnancies that end in prematurity, stillbirth, growth retardation, or fetal distress. We suggest that placental pathology should be a routine component of obstetric-neonatal care. 
Ischemic colitis associated with dextroamphetamine use. Ischemic colitis can be caused by a variety of medications including a number of sympathomimetic agents. We report the case of a 47-year-old narcoleptic man who had abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. The clinical, radiographic, and histologic findings supported the diagnosis of ischemic colitis associated with oral dextroamphetamine use. 
Slow toxins, biologic markers, and long-latency neurodegenerative disease in the western Pacific region. The western Pacific parkinsonism-dementia and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis complex is a prototypical neurodegenerative disorder found among inhabitants of Guam, New Guinea (Irian Jaya, Indonesia) and Japan (Kii Peninsula, Honshu). Nonviral environmental factors peculiar to the affected populations seem to play a prominent etiologic role. Although cause-effect relationships cannot be established by epidemiologic studies alone, we have shown in all three affected population groups that individuals develop the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis variant of this disorder after heavy exposure to the raw or incompletely detoxified seed of neurotoxic cycad plants. Since long periods may elapse between cycad exposure and the appearance of neurological disease in humans, cycads may harbor a "slow toxin" that causes the postmitotic neuron to undergo slow irreversible degeneration. Two cycad neurotoxins are recognized, one of which (cycasin) is known to have long-latency effects (tumorigenesis) on mitotic neurons and replicating cells in other tissues. This paper explores the possible relationship between tumorigenesis and long-latency neurotoxicity, and discusses possible biologic markers of cycad exposure and subclinical neurodegenerative disease. 
Complications following thyroid surgery. The incidence of severe complications following thyroid gland surgery is a major reason to recommend total thyroidectomy or a less radical procedure in treating thyroid gland diseases. A retrospective study on 335 thyroidectomies was performed to assess the incidence of postoperative complications. Rates for hypocalcemia were based on patients undergoing bilateral procedures (n = 185) and on nerves at risk for recurrent laryngeal nerve injury (n = 513). Permanent hypocalcemia (8%) and unilateral laryngeal nerve injury (2.3%) were the major complications, with 0.8% having fatal complications. The achievement of long-term normal serum calcium levels has been the most frequent complication. Recurrent laryngeal nerve injury had a significant relationship with secondary procedures, histologic findings, and no nerve identification during surgery. In our series, major complications can be blamed on technical pitfalls, even in the hands of experienced surgeons. 
Respiratory and circulatory analysis of CO2 output during exercise in chronic heart failure. BACKGROUND. The output of carbon dioxide (VCO2) is controlled by both hemodynamics and ventilation. To understand VCO2 in patients who have chronic heart failure (CHF), we studied 14 patients who had New York Heart Association functional class III failure by measurements of hemodynamics, ventilation, and arterial and venous blood gases at rest and at 50 W of cycle ergometry exercise. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fick principle analysis of VCO2 showed that because of a limited increase in cardiac output, CHF patients widened their venoarterial CO2 content difference from 4.9 +/- 3.5 ml/dl at rest to 11.1 +/- 4.0 ml/dl with exercise (p less than 0.05). This increase in CO2 content difference was achieved with no change in venous CO2 content (from 54.3 +/- 3.3 ml/dl at rest to 54.5 +/- 4.8 ml/dl at exercise, p = NS); however, there was a decrease of arterial CO2 content (from 49.4 +/- 3.7 ml/dl at rest to 43.4 +/- 2.3 ml/dl with exercise, p less than 0.05). Modeling of the CO2 tension-content relation showed that there would have been a small, nonproportional increase of venous CO2 content as venous CO2 tension increased from 43.2 +/- 1.8 mm Hg at rest to 55.3 +/- 4.2 mm Hg during exercise (p less than 0.05); however, the development of metabolic acidosis during exercise entirely blunted the increase of CO2 content. In contrast, both the shape of the tension-content relation and the acidosis of exercise further influenced the decrease of arterial CO2 content as arterial CO2 tension decreased from 37.0 +/- 2.9 mm Hg at rest to 32.0 +/- 3.4 mm Hg during exercise (p less than 0.05) as a result of excess ventilation. CONCLUSIONS. In CHF patients during exercise, the circulatory limitations imposed by a low cardiac output on VCO2 are compensated by a widened venoarterial CO2 content difference. The content difference is not widened through an increase of venous CO2 content but rather by a decrease of arterial CO2 content caused by arterial hypocapnia and metabolic acidosis. 
A review of 35 endometrial ablations using the Nd:YAG laser for recurrent menometrorrhagia. Endometrial ablation with the Nd:YAG laser can be used to treat recurrent dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Two series of patients were studied. All suffered for at least 1 year with recurrent menometrorrhagia that was unresponsive to other treatments such as hormonal therapy or removal of polyps or fibroids. In the first series, 75 patients presenting with menometrorrhagia were considered for endometrial ablation using Nd:YAG laser, and 23 met conservative requirements. In the second series, 12 of the 25 patients considered met the conservative requirements. The patients in series I received danazol for 30 days before and 30 days after the procedure; patients in series II received leuprolide acetate. All patients were followed for at least 1 year after treatment was discontinued. Of the 35 patients in both series, 21 (60%) were found to have complete cessation of menstruation. Eleven (31.43%) resumed menstruating but at acceptable levels. Three patients (8.57%) had unsatisfactory results, one who later had a repeat ablation and two who had hysterectomies. Thus, 32 of 35 patients were successfully treated without further intervention after laser ablation. Nd:YAG endometrial ablation is efficacious and cost-effective for recurrent menometrorrhagia in selected patients. The additional benefit of this procedure is the avoidance of hysterectomies and postsurgical complications as well as the psychological consequences of a hysterectomy. 
The stimulus responsible for the peritoneal fluid inflammation observed in infertile women with endometriosis. OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that menstrual debris from ectopic endometrium is the stimulus responsible for eliciting the peritoneal fluid (PF) inflammation observed in infertile women with endometriosis. DESIGN, SETTING, PATIENTS: The extent of endometriosis was correlated with the PF volume and total PF cell count retrospectively in 135 infertile women with endometriosis. RESULTS: The volume and total cell count were positively correlated, whereas the total cell count was negatively correlated with the extent of endometriosis. Despite a similar negative trend, no statistically significant correlation was noted between the volume and the extent of endometriosis. These relationships did not change when the data were reanalyzed deleting those pathological features contributing to the endometriosis score but not capable of producing intraperitoneal menstrual debris, i.e., adhesions and encapsulated ovarian endometriomas. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that menstrual debris from ectopic endometrium is probably not a major factor in the elicitation of the observed PF inflammation in infertile women with endometriosis and suggest an inverse relationship may exist between PF inflammation and the extent of endometriosis. 
Response to the cold pressor test in normotensive and hypertensive patients. The response to the cold pressor test (CPT) was studied in 49 normotensive (NT) and 73 patients with essential sustained hypertension (HT). Patients were classified as responders when they increased their systolic pressure (SBP) by at least 16 mm Hg or their diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by at least 12 mm Hg. Forty-seven out of seventy-three (64%) increased their mean blood pressure (MBP) by 18.6 +/- 1.4 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) in response to CPT. In NT subjects 23 out of 49 (47%) were responders (MBP = 16.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg). In NT, but not in HT, patients, a negative relationship was observed between MBP changes during CPT and age (P less than .001) or basal DBP (P less than .01). There was no relationship between blood pressure response and the presence of a family history of hypertension. A positive correlation was found in HT patients between basal levels of active renin (AR) in the upright position and MBP changes during CPT (P less than .001). Mean plasma AR was 24.2 +/- 3.5 pg/mL in nonresponders v 37.5 +/- 2.9 pg/mL in responders (P less than .001). In HT, but not in NT, patients, blood pressure changes were associated with a simultaneous increase in HR (P less than .01 between delta MBP and delta HR). These results suggest that blood pressure elevation during CPT is a very common reaction in young normotensive subjects especially in those that have the lowest mean blood pressure. Therefore it is unlikely that CPT may be used as a predictor test of future hypertension in this population. 
Colorectal surgery: short-term prophylaxis with clindamycin plus aztreonam or gentamicin. A randomized study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of aztreonam plus clindamycin with that of gentamicin plus clindamycin for prophylaxis of infection following colorectal surgery. A total of 138 patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery were randomized to treatment with clindamycin (600 mg) plus either aztreonam (1 g) or gentamicin (80 mg) 30 minutes before and 8 and 16 hours after surgery. The study included 122 patients (88.4%) with colorectal carcinoma. Samples from the abdominal cavity and from the subcutaneous tissues were taken for bacteriologic study. All samples from the abdominal cavity yielded microorganisms; both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were isolated. Wound infections occurred in eight patients (12.1%) in the aztreonam group and in 12 patients (16.7%) in the gentamicin group. Escherichia coli, Bacteroides species, enterococci, and staphylococci were isolated most frequently from wounds and were often isolated from bacteriologic samples from the abdominal cavity of the same patients. The incidence of septic complications reflected the extent of nutritional and immunologic impairment. No significant differences were found between groups in the rate of urinary tract or lower respiratory tract infections. Aztreonam/clindamycin appears to be a valid alternative to gentamicin/clindamycin for the prophylaxis of infections following colorectal surgery. 
Biochemical and morphological analysis of the interaction of epidermal growth factor and parathyroid hormone with UMR 106 osteosarcoma cells. The interaction of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and PTH with UMR 106 osteosarcoma cells was examined biochemically and morphologically. EGF inhibited PTH-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in association with a reduction in PTH receptors and a decrease in the activity of the stimulatory guanyl nucleotide-binding protein (Gs). Universal inhibition of agonist-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity did not occur, inasmuch as EGF did not reduce prostaglandin E2-enhanced enzyme activity. The influence of EGF on PTH action correlated with its effect in the UMR 106 cell population of promoting entry into the cell cycle. Morphological analysis with radioautography indicated that both EGF and PTH receptors could be colocalized to certain UMR 106 cells, but that each were more abundantly distributed over discrete UMR 106 cell types. Based on the distribution of [3H]thymidine incorporation, EGF receptors were predominantly found over rapidly proliferating cells, whereas PTH receptors were most densely distributed over more quiescent cells. The results indicate that EGF and PTH receptors are localized over specific types within the heterogeneous population of UMR 106 cells and suggest that EGF may reduce PTH action in these cultures by enhancing the proliferation of progenitor cells lacking PTH receptors and reducing differentiation in this cell population, which leads to PTH receptor-enriched target cells. EGF and PTH receptors may, therefore, be useful as probes to examine both functional interactions and differentiation pathways among cells in osteoblast models in vitro and perhaps in vivo. 
Computed tomography of the brain in kwashiorkor: a follow up study. Computed tomography of the brain was performed initially and after nutritional rehabilitation on 12 children with kwashiorkor. The severe cerebral shrinkage evident initially resolved after nutritional rehabilitation. The mechanism and significance of this reversible abnormality remains to be determined. 
Intraarterial drug abuse: new treatment options. Accidental, intraarterial injections of abused substances continue to be difficult management problems because of severe vascular complications. Vasospasm probably plays an important role in the pathophysiology of this injury, in addition to the more accepted roles of thrombosis and endarteritis. Three patients with severe, upper extremity ischemia after intraarterial injection of heroin, methamphetamine, and meperidine were treated with intraarterial tolazoline and streptokinase, along with intravenous heparin. All three patients had improved perfusion, assessed both clinically and by angiography. The responses to treatment in these patients demonstrated the roles of vasospasm and thrombosis in the origin of this injury and the therapeutic benefits of appropriately administered vasodilators and thrombolytic agents. 
Endogenous interferon-gamma, macrophage activation, and murine host defense against acute infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. Parenteral interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activates murine macrophages to inhibit Trypanosoma cruzi multiplication and diminishes parasitemia and mortality in acute infection. To investigate the role of endogenous IFN-gamma in acute infection, monoclonal antibody to IFN-gamma was injected intraperitoneally into mice. The 6250 neutralizing units given 24 and 96 h after infection reproducibly increased mortality (P less than .05). Histology sections showed markedly more nests of T. cruzi in treated mice. BALB/c, Swiss Webster, C57Bl/6, and C3H/HEN mice were susceptible to the effects of anti-IFN-gamma. Peritoneal macrophages from mice 4 days after infection and a single dose of 6250 units of anti-IFN-gamma had significantly reduced ability to inhibit T. cruzi multiplication. Multiple doses of anti-IFN-gamma delayed but did not prevent macrophage activation. These results indicate the critical role of endogenous IFN-gamma for macrophage activation and host defense against acute T. cruzi infection in mice. 
Penetrating craniocerebral missile injuries in civilians: a retrospective analysis of 314 cases. Analysis of 314 cases of penetrating craniocerebral missile injuries in civilians revealed a high rate of early mortality, with 228 victims having died at the scene and a further 38 dead within 3 hours. Surgery was performed in 44 patients who had a preoperative Glasgow Coma Score of at least 4. Out of the 26 survivors, all operated upon, 19 had an adequate recovery (score of 0-3 on the expanded Glasgow Outcome Scale). Vigorous resuscitation and early surgery often resulted in useful survivals and occasionally in spectacular recoveries. However, the high mortality rate on the scene or soon after the injury restricted the possibility of effective management to a minority of cases. 
Increased paracellular permeability in intrahepatic cholestasis induced by carmustine (BCNU) in rats. Carmustine [i.e., 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU)] is a drug with cholestatic potency both in experimental animals and in humans. To study the mechanisms involved in the development of the hepatic lesions, early changes in liver function in rats pretreated with the drug were investigated. Dosages and sampling times that did not result in hepatocellular injury, as indicated by release of marker enzymes, were applied. In isolated perfused livers from pretreated rats, bile flow and maximal secretion rate of taurocholate were decreased. An increase in biliary [14C]sucrose clearance suggested enhanced permeability of the bile tract and was correlated with increased inorganic phosphate concentration in bile. To assess the contribution of paracellular and transcellular pathways of sucrose, [14C]sucrose access into bile was analyzed by biliary off-kinetics after omission of the radioactive marker from the perfusion medium. An improved method was developed to quantitate the permeability of the bile tract by applying the classical flow equation to the paracellular portion of biliary sucrose clearance. With this method it was shown that pretreatment of rats with BCNU resulted in an increase in both diffusion and convection of paracellular sucrose from perfusate into bile. Accordingly, the fast access of horseradish peroxidase from perfusate into bile was facilitated in isolated perfused livers of BCNU-treated rats. The results indicate that an increase in paracellular permeability is an early alteration that may contribute to the development of hepatotoxic lesions caused by BCNU. It is shown that inert solute clearance can be used to assess paracellular permeability if the paracellular fraction is determined. 
Radiographic evaluation and diagnosis of the failed frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration. In the absence of evidence of suppurative disease, clinical assessment of the symptomatic patient after frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration is difficult because the cause of the pain is often neuralgic or from chronic vascular headache. Among 59 patients who have undergone this procedure at our institution since 1979, four required revision surgery. These patients were evaluated by computed tomographic and magnetic resonance scans, and the radiographic findings were compared with those present in 20 asymptomatic subjects. On the basis of the results of this study, we believe we can objectively identify those patients with chronic pain in whom the operation has been unsuccessful. A review of our experience with this procedure is presented along with criteria that enable early diagnosis of recurrent disease in the frontal sinus after osteoplastic sinusotomy. 
13-cis-retinoic acid induces cellular differentiation and durable remission in refractory cutaneous Ki-1 lymphoma. A 35-year-old man with refractory cutaneous Ki-1 lymphoma was salvaged successfully with oral 13-cis-retinoic acid (1 mg/kg/day). He had a complete remission lasting for 20 months before a single nodule recurred on his skin. Excisional biopsy of the recurrent tumor revealed a distinct morphologic change, suggesting cellular differentiation toward a more benign phenotype. No significant side effects were noted except mild xerostomia, bone pain, and hyperlipidemia. The authors believe that 13-cis-retinoic acid should be considered in the treatment of cutaneous Ki-1 lymphoma. 
The role of plasminogen activator in adhesion prevention. The reduction in peritoneal plasminogen activator activity (believed to be the pathogenic mechanism of adhesion formation) and its replacement with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) have been investigated in the prevention of initial (primary) and recurrent adhesion production. Other, potentially harmful, effects of intra-abdominal rt-PA application have also been examined. This included effects on wound and colonic healing and hemostasis. The prevention of adhesion formation was studied in primary and recurrent adhesion formation using a rabbit model. Primary adhesions formed in one of 14 occasions (7 per cent) with rt-PA compared with 12 of 15 occasions (80 per cent) with placebo (chi-square equals 15.542, p less than 0.001). Recurrent adhesions formed on two of 27 occasions (7 per cent) with rt-PA compared with 22 of 28 occasions with placebo (79 per cent) and 12 of 12 occasions with control rabbits (100 per cent, chi-square equals 40.588, p less than 0.0001). The application of rt-PA to abdominal wounds in the rabbit failed to show any reduction in wound strength at four, seven and ten days. Colonic anastomotic healing was unaltered by rt-PA at three, five and seven days. There was no difference seen in hemorrhagic events between control, placebo or rt-PA rabbits at any stage. The use of rt-PA is an exciting development in the field of adhesion prevention; it is an effective inhibitor of adhesion formation and intra-abdominal administration appears safe in a rabbit model. 
Comparative efficacy of cimetidine, famotidine, ranitidine, and mylanta in postoperative stress ulcers. Gastric pH control and ulcer prevention in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. To determine the comparative efficacy of several histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists (cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine) and the antacid Mylanta-II (Stuart Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE) in gastric pH control and the prevention of postoperative stress ulceration, a prospective, randomized study was performed in a homogeneous population of patients with elective coronary artery bypass. None of the 57 patients in the study population had a documented history of ulcer disease. There were four treatment groups, each with similar demographics (age and sex). Cimetidine-treated group consisted of 15, famotidine-treated group of 18, ranitidine-treated group of 19, and antacid-treated group of 5 patients. There was no hemodynamically significant postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding in any of the patients. When the agents were compared for efficacy of gastric pH control, statistically better pH control was found in the famotidine- and ranitidine-treated groups (P less than 0.003) than in the cimetidine-treated group (pH less than or equal to 4.0) during the 20-hour observation period. Side effects (hematologic and neurological) were noted only in the cimetidine-treated group. The results of this study indicate that in patients in postoperative intensive care, better gastric pH control, and thus prevention of gastric stress ulcers, is achieved with either famotidine or ranitidine rather than cimetidine or antacid. 
Peritoneal seeding following potentially curative resection of colonic carcinoma: implications for adjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapeutic strategies for colon cancer are based on the knowledge of tumor recurrence patterns following potentially curative resection. Innovative methods for regional delivery of chemotherapy to the liver and peritoneal surfaces are now available to complement systemic treatment. We reviewed clinical, reoperation, and autopsy series to determine the incidence of peritoneal seeding following colon cancer resection. The data suggest a 25-35 percent peritoneal failure rate among patients that recur, indicating that intraperitoneal chemotherapy is a sensible adjuvant approach. The theory behind intraperitoneal chemotherapy and potential complications is discussed. We suggest initiation of clinical trials combining systemic and intraperitoneal chemotherapy. 
A case of granulomatous hepatitis after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration. A 61-year-old man received intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as treatment for superficial bladder carcinoma. High spiking relapsing fevers began 39 days after the initial treatment. A liver biopsy revealed noncaseating granuloma. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization of the bone marrow was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Pressure exerted to instill the BCG may have favored dissemination. 
Autotransplantation of dispersed pancreatic islet tissue combined with total or near-total pancreatectomy for treatment of chronic pancreatitis. Chronic pancreatitis is difficult to treat in patients with a nondilated duct. Patients experiencing intractable pain unresponsive to or judged untreatable by lesser procedures must decide between total pancreatectomy and resultant diabetes or a continuation of their pancreatitis. From 1977 through 1990, 26 patients underwent extensive pancreatectomy and dispersed pancreatic islet tissue autotransplantation for treatment of chronic pancreatitis pain and prophylaxis of surgical diabetes. Of these 26 patients, total (Whipple) or near-total (greater than 95%) pancreatectomy was performed in 24 patients. Of these 24 patients, pain relief could be assessed in 21 patients at 5 to 155 months (mean, 5.7 years), and 19 patients (90%) reported partial or complete remission. Of the patients who underwent total or near-total pancreatectomy, islets were injected intraportally in 22 patients and into the renal subcapsule in two patients. The latter two patients have required insulin since surgery. Of the other 22, one patient died from a complication of the pancreatectomy. Nine of the 21 evaluable recipients of intraportal islet autografts were insulin independent for at least several months after surgery. Five patients are currently insulin independent at 6 years, 4 years, 1.5 years, 9 months, and 5 months after surgery. Of the other four patients, one patient died insulin independent at 6 years, and three patients required insulin beginning 8 to 18 months after surgery. Insulin independence correlated with the number of islets recovered, which in turn correlated inversely with the degree of pancreatic fibrosis. Of our four most recent patients, three patients had mildly to moderately fibrotic glands, and higher numbers of islets were obtained. After total (Whipple) pancreatectomy, these three patients are insulin independent. A liver biopsy was performed in one patient 8 months after total pancreatectomy and islet autotransplantation; numerous clusters of islet cells staining strongly for insulin and glucagon were detected within portal triads on both wedge and needle biopsy specimens. Morbidity related to the intraportal-dispersed pancreatic islet tissue transplantation was low (no disseminated intravascular coagulation, significant portal hypertension, or hepatic dysfunction). Islet autotransplantation can be an effective and safe adjunct to extensive pancreatic resection for those patients who risk surgical diabetes for relief of their chronic pancreatitis pain. 
Carotid duplex sonography: bisferious pulse contour in patients with aortic valvular disease. Characteristic systolic and diastolic pulse contours occur in the carotid Doppler waveforms of patients with aortic valvular disease that have not previously been described in publications concerning carotid duplex sonography. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the presence and characterize the nature of these carotid duplex waveform abnormalities in patients with known aortic valve disease and to correlate these changes with the severity of valve dysfunction. The study group consisted of 26 patients with aortic regurgitation or combined aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis. Duplex studies were retrospectively reviewed by two radiologists for the presence of two systolic peaks, and for the presence of diastolic reversal of flow direction. This pattern of two systolic peaks, characteristic of aortic regurgitation, is called bisferious from the Latin "twice beating." Aortic regurgitation was graded by echocardiography as mild, moderate, or severe by the cardiologists reviewing the examination. A group of 20 age-matched patients without aortic valvular disease were similarly assessed. The bisferious pattern was demonstrated in 13 (50%) of 26 patients. Five (19%) of 26 patients had significant reversal of diastolic flow. Four patients were studied both before and after aortic valve replacement. Three had bisferious wave contours preoperatively; two of these also had diastolic reversal of flow. The fourth patient had retrograde flow in diastole without systolic contour abnormality. Postoperatively, all carotid waveforms were normal. None of the duplex waveforms in the control group demonstrated characteristic systolic or diastolic abnormalities. The bisferious waveform and retrograde diastolic flow are Doppler patterns associated with aortic valvular disease. These patterns are reversible after aortic valve replacement. While echocardiography remains the study of choice in the evaluation of suspected valvular dysfunction, up to one third of patients with aortic regurgitation may not have a detectable murmur. Therefore, identifying these patterns on carotid duplex examinations may provide clinically useful information and serve as a clue to previously unsuspected cardiovascular disease. 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian arteries: long-term results in 52 patients. We studied the long-term results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery in treating stenosis (43 patients) or occlusion (nine patients). In all 52 patients, the blood pressure before treatment in the arm on the involved side was at least 30 mm Hg lower than that in the opposite arm. Thirty-nine patients (75%) had symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (dizziness, blurred vision, ataxia). Angioplasty was successful in 40 (93%) of 43 patients with stenosis and in five (56%) of nine patients with occlusion. In the successfully treated patients, follow-up angiograms showed absence of narrowing greater than 30% stenosis, and the blood pressure in the treated arm equaled that in the opposite arm. The patients were followed up for 6-48 months (mean, 29 months). During this time, the blood pressure in the treated arm remained normal in 41 (91%) of 45 patients. The symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency subsided in 28 (72%) of 39 patients. These results suggest that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is useful for treating subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion. 
Systemic toxicity of ropivacaine during ovine pregnancy. Ropivacaine is a new amide local anesthetic structurally related to bupivacaine and mepivacaine. Its potency and duration of action are similar to those of bupivacaine but its therapeutic index may be greater. Since pregnancy enhances the cardiotoxicity of bupivacaine, the current study was devised to compare the toxicity of ropivacaine in chronically instrumented nonpregnant and pregnant ewes during continuous intravenous infusion of the drug at the rate of 0.5 mg.kg-1.min-1. In all animals, symptoms of local anesthetic toxicity occurred in the usual order--convulsions, hypotension, apnea, and circulatory collapse. There were no significant differences between the two groups of animals in the doses and plasma concentrations of ropivacaine associated with each toxic manifestations. For example, circulatory collapse occurred at a mean dose of 11.3 +/- 1.1 mg.kg-1 in nonpregnant and 12.4 +/- 0.9 mg.kg-1 in pregnant animals, with corresponding plasma concentrations of 7.3 +/- 0.3 and 9.6 +/- 2.1 micrograms.ml-1 (P = not significant). Protein binding of ropivacaine in the concentration range associated with toxic manifestations was similar in sera obtained from nonpregnant and pregnant ewes. In conclusion, ovine pregnancy does not enhance the systemic toxicity of ropivacaine, possibly because of an absence of gestation-related increase in the availability of free drug. 
Long-term preservation of the mammalian myocardium. Effect of storage medium and temperature on the vulnerability to tissue injury. Human heart preservation for transplantation commonly involves infusion of cold cardioplegic solutions and subsequent immersion in the same solution. The objectives of the present study were (1) to establish the temporal relationship between storage time (at 10 degrees C) and the postischemic recovery of function in the isolated rat heart, (2) to assess, by metabolic and functional measurements, whether storing the heart in fluid as opposed to moist air had any effect on the viability of the preparation, and (3) to ascertain the optimal storage temperature. Isolated rat hearts (at least 6 in each group) were infused for 3 minutes with St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution No. 2 at 10 degrees C, stored at 10 degrees C for 6, 12, 18, or 24 hours, and then reperfused at 37 degrees C. Mechanical function, assessed by construction of pressure-volume curves (balloon volumes: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 microliters), was measured before ischemia and storage and after 60 minutes of reperfusion. Function deteriorated in a time-dependent manner; thus at a balloon volume of 60 microliters the recovery of left ventricular developed pressure was 84.2% +/- 5.3% after 6 hours (p = not significant when compared with preischemic control); 69.1 +/- 3.3% after 12 hours (p less than 0.05); 55.6% +/- 4.4% after 18 hours (p less than 0.05), and 53.0% +/- 6.8% (p less than 0.05) after 24 hours of storage. Other indices of cardiac function, together with creatine kinase leakage and high-energy phosphate content, supported these observations. Since the recovery of the left ventricular developed pressure balloon volume curves were essentially flat after 18 and 24 hours of storage, either 6 or 12 hours of storage were therefore used in subsequent studies. Comparison of storage environment (hearts either immersed in St. Thomas Hospital cardioplegic solution No. 2 or suspended in moist air at 10 degrees C for 6 or 12 hours) revealed no significant differences in functional recovery between the groups. Thus hearts recovered 94.9% +/- 3.5% and 113.7% +/- 12.4%, respectively, after 6 hours of storage and 71.6% +/- 2.4% and 54.2% +/- 7.9%, respectively, after 12 hours of storage. Enzyme leakage and tissue water gain were also similar in both groups of hearts. Finally, hearts (n = 6 per group) were subjected to 12 hours' storage at 1.0 degree, 5.0 degrees, 7.5 degrees, 10.0 degrees, 12.5 degrees, 15.0 degrees, and 20.0 degrees C.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Should all patients with node-negative breast cancer receive adjuvant therapy? Identifying additional subsets of low-risk patients who are highly curable by surgery alone. This study, which used combined first-generation prognostic factors (tumor size, histologic differentiation, and age) on 408 patients with axillary node-negative (ANN) breast cancer treated by surgery alone without systemic adjuvant therapy between 1976 and 1987 at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, discerned four subsets of low-risk patients with a 7-year relapse rate of 6% or better. The first subset consisted of 48 patients (12% of the population) with tumors 1 cm or less in diameter that were well or moderately differentiated. These patients had a disease-free rate (DFR) of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94% to 100%). The second subset consisted of 35 patients (9% of the population) with tumors less than or equal to 1 cm that were poorly differentiated or anaplastic. These patients older than 50 years of age had a DFR of 97% (95% CI, 91% to 100%). The third subset consisted of 36 patients (9% of the population) with tumors 1.1 to 2 cm that were well or moderately differentiated. These patients were older than 50 years of age and had a DFR of 94% (95% CI, 85% to 100%). The fourth subset consisted of 36 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ with microscopic invasion. These patients had a DFR of 100% (95% CI, 87% to 100%). Twenty-two of these patients, not in the other subsets mentioned, comprised 5% of the total population. These patients at low risk of recurrence, who comprise one third of the entire node-negative population, are highly curable by local therapy alone and may be spared the risks and costs of routine adjuvant systemic therapy (AST). Patients with tumors larger than 2 cm (152 patients; 37% of the population) are at high risk of recurrence (26% with a DFR of 74% [95% CI, 64% to 84%]) and should routinely receive systemic adjuvant therapy. Patients with tumors up to 2 cm who are not in the low-risk groups fall in a gray area (recurrence, 15% to 21%; DFR, 79% to 85%). For these groups, combining second-generation prognostic factors such as DNA ploidy, S-phase fraction, or cathepsin D should give the physician additional information to aid in making decisions regarding adjuvant therapy. 
Risk factors influencing mortality after bipolar hemiarthroplasty in the treatment of fracture of the femoral neck. The hospital records of 204 patients (mean age 80 years, range 54-96 years) with a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture treated by cemented bipolar hemiarthroplasty were examined to record all available data on factors suspected of influencing mortality. The data were analyzed statistically using survival analysis (Cox model). The six months mortality rate was 20% and the one year mortality rate was 28%. The following factors, in order to decreasing importance, had significant influence on mortality: cardiac factors other than previous myocardial infarction; status as a nursing home patient; chronic pulmonary disease; serum creatinine level greater than 1.7 mg/100 ml; pneumonia; previous myocardial infarction; duration of surgery; and gender. The following factors had no significant influence on mortality: age, time delay from admission to surgery, mode of anesthesia, and cerebrovascular diseases. In conclusion, medical conditions were the most important determinants of survival in the present study. The time delay between admission and surgery did not influence the chances of survival. This does not mean that surgical delay beyond that essential for stabilizing the patient is not problematic, but indicates that ample time should be spent on assessment and resuscitation before surgery. 
Incidence of heterotopic ossification after total hip replacement: effect of the type of fixation of the femoral component. The incidence and severity of heterotopic ossification after sixty-five consecutive primary uncemented total hip replacements were compared with those after seventy consecutive primary hybrid total hip replacements (consisting of an uncemented acetabular component and a cemented femoral component). All patients had had the arthroplasty because of osteoarthrosis. The sex distribution, prevalence of bilateral disease of the hip, and frequency of previous operations were similar in both groups. All of the operations were performed by one surgeon who used the same operative approach. Preoperative, immediate postoperative, and six-month follow-up radiographs were reviewed for all patients. For 90 per cent of the hips, radiographs that were made after a minimum follow-up of one year were also reviewed. In the group of patients who had an uncemented femoral component, there was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of heterotopic bone and in its severity. Either none or only class-I ectopic bone developed in 74 per cent of the hips in the hybrid group, compared with 40 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005). In contrast, class-III or IV heterotopic ossification was evident in 13 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005). None of the patients in the hybrid group needed reoperation for excision of ectopic bone, but four (6 per cent) of the patients in the uncemented group needed such a reoperation because of severe limitation of motion. 
Acute transient thrombocytopenia associated with cocaine abuse in pregnancy. A case is described of cocaine-induced severe transient thrombocytopenia associated with a hypertensive crisis at 21 weeks' gestation. Liver function tests and coagulation studies were all within normal ranges. Blood pressure was controlled with hydralazine. This clinical presentation, similar to severe preeclampsia, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute hypertension and low platelet count, especially in early gestations when preeclampsia is relatively rare. Unlike severe preeclampsia, for which active intervention and delivery are usually selected, cocaine-related hypertension-thrombocytopenia, especially in very premature gestations, may warrant conservative management. 
A randomized trial in inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer: vindesine and cisplatin versus mitomycin, vindesine, and cisplatin versus etoposide and cisplatin alternating with vindesine and mitomycin. Patients with inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomly assigned to receive one of three dosage regimens: (1) vindesine and cisplatin (VP); (2) mitomycin, vindesine, and cisplatin (MVP); or (3) etoposide and cisplatin alternating with vindesine and mitomycin (EP/VM). In 199 assessable patients, the response rates were VP, 33%; MVP, 43%; and EP/VM, 19%. The addition of mitomycin to the VP regimen did not significantly improve the response rate. The response rate was significantly lower with the EP/VM regimen than with the MVP regimen (P less than .01). The median survival times were VP, 50 weeks; MVP, 42 weeks; and EP/VM, 40 weeks. These differences were not significant. Grade III or IV thrombocytopenia was significantly greater (P less than .01) in MVP patients (22%) than in the VP (5%). Other toxicities were similar in the three groups. Analyses of prognostic factors showed that treatment with MVP, sex, and histologic classification (squamous cell carcinoma) were predictive of improved response. Important factors for improved survival, according to the Cox regression analysis, were the stage of disease, performance status, sex, weight loss before diagnosis, and hemoglobin concentration. 
Post-herpetic neuralgia: further post-mortem studies of cases with and without pain. The pathological features associated with post-herpetic neuralgia require further study. We report here 5 cases, 3 with severe post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) and 2 with no persistent pain. The findings of dorsal horn atrophy and cell, axon and myelin loss with fibrosis in the sensory ganglion were found only in patients with persistent pain. Marked loss of myelin and axons in the nerve and/or sensory root were found in cases with and without pain. Some evidence is presented for a more generalized subacute or chronic inflammatory process which may explain the clinical features of some patients. Further studies will be necessary to fully describe the morbid anatomy of this disorder. 
Murine anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody therapy for a patient with plasma cell leukemia. A patient with primary plasma cell leukemia resistant to chemotherapy was treated for 2 months with daily intravenous injections of anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). The patient's clinical status improved throughout the treatment and no major side effects were observed. Serial monitoring showed blockage of the myeloma cell proliferation in the bone marrow (from 4.5% to 0% myeloma cells in the S-phase in vivo) as well as reduction in the serum calcium, serum monoclonal IgG, and the serum C-reactive protein levels. The serum calcium and serum monoclonal IgG corrected by approximately 30%, whereas the C-reactive protein corrected to undetectable levels during treatment. No major side effects developed, although both platelet and circulating neutrophil counts decreased during anti-IL-6 therapy. A transient immunization was detected 15 days after the initiation of the treatment, which could explain the recovery of myeloma cell proliferation after 2 months of treatment (2% myeloma cells in the S phase). In conclusion, this first anti-IL-6 clinical trial demonstrated the feasibility of injecting anti-IL-6 MoAbs, and also a transient tumor cytostasis and a reduction in IL-6-related toxicities. It gave insight into the major biologic activities of IL-6 in vivo and may serve as a basis for further development of anti-IL-6 therapy in myeloma and other IL-6-related diseases. 
The prognostic significance of autologous bone marrow transplant in advanced neuroblastoma This report provides strong evidence for conducting a controlled randomized clinical trial of autologous bone marrow transplantation versus conventional chemotherapy in childhood neuroblastoma, which is disseminated beyond the intracavity nodes, and which is diagnosed in children older than 12 months of age. On the basis of two Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) studies, one a surgery plus conventional chemotherapy study (POG 8441) and the other an elective autologous transplant pilot protocol (POG 8340), there was no significant prognostic benefit of switching in remission from the surgery plus chemotherapy protocol to the transplant protocol (P = .91) or of switching in remission from the surgery plus chemotherapy protocol to any transplant (P = .75). The analysis is based on 116 patients achieving a complete or partial remission, 32 of whom received transplants on the pilot protocol, and 17 of whom received transplants outside the pilot protocol. While potential selection bias precludes cause-effect conclusions, these data strongly suggest that a large randomized trial of autologous bone marrow transplantation should be conducted before accepting this form of therapy as standard. 
Waking and rising at night as a trigger of myocardial ischemia. A diurnal pattern of changes in transient myocardial ischemia has been well documented in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) with an increase in the early morning hours. To further investigate potential triggers of ischemia, certain defined and distinct episodes of waking and rising during the nighttime were examined. Of 113 patients who underwent ambulatory monitoring of the electrocardiogram, 466 episodes of ischemia lasting 3,926 minutes were detected in 67 of the patients. In 30 patients who had ischemia at night, 21 reported 36 occasions of waking and rising, and 67% of these events were associated with ST-segment depression. Frequency and duration of ischemia were similar in the nocturnal episodes versus the early morning episodes of ischemia as were the increases in heart rate at 30, 10, 5 and 1 minute before the onset. Even before waking, there was an increase in heart rate beginning approximately 30 minutes before the onset of ischemia. This increase became significant 5 minutes before onset both in the early morning and on rising at night. Patients with nocturnal ischemia had significantly worse clinical signs of CAD. This study shows that rising at night is often associated with episodes of myocardial ischemia and, like the morning events on rising, is likely an important trigger of ischemia in patients with CAD. 
A feasibility study of the SDI test for the evaluation of gastrointestinal cancer sensitivity to anticancer drugs. The succinic dehydrogenase inhibition (SDI) test has been widely used to evaluate the sensitivity of cancer cells to anticancer agents. Recently, the techniques for tissue culture have progressed; the ability to make formazan has improved with the use of methylthiazol tetrazolium bromide (MTT) instead of triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in this assay. Therefore, we modified the SDI test in order to evaluate the drug response to gastrointestinal cancer and applied it in a clinical study. In this assay, the optimal concentration levels of mytomycin-C and Adriamycin for the clinical materials are 10 micrograms/ml, that is, 10 times higher than for the cancer cell line, and that of Cisplatin is 30 micrograms/ml, for Cisplatin is unstable in the culture medium. To evaluate its antitumor effect, it was found necessary to expose the cancer cells to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for 3 days. We applied this assay for the clinical materials; the evaluable rate of this assay is 83.3%. The peculiarity of this assay is its high evaluable rate. These results suggest that this test may be useful for clinical application. 
Human cervical epithelial cells that express HLA-DR associated with viral infection and activated mononuclear cell infiltrate. The association between the expression of HLA-DR antigens on cervical epithelium and the local immune state of activation in colposcopically obtained biopsy specimens from patients with histologically documented wart virus infection was investigated. In normal cervical epithelium no HLA-DR staining was detected. No or few IL-2R positive cells were found in the contiguous sections. HLA-DR was expressed by epithelial cells in six out of the 14 samples of wart virus infection. The pattern of fluorescence was focal, but strong and diffuse, to the whole epithelial layer. In the six samples with HLA-DR positive epithelium the numbers of IL-2R positive cells in the lamina propria were strongly increased, ranging between 75 and 90%. HLA-DR expression by cervical epithelium was observed in only two of 12 samples from patients with mixed epithelial non-virus related abnormalities. No increase in the numbers of IL-2R positive cells was observed in this group of patients. Additionally, no significant differences in terms of T lymphocyte infiltrate were found among the three groups. The results indicate that wart virus infection is associated with enhanced HLA-DR epithelial expression and they lend support to the concept that in the human cervix the epithelium actively participates in the local immune response. 
Results of spinal arthrodesis with pedicle screw-plate fixation. Sixty-one patients were followed for an average of thirty months (range, twenty-four to thirty-five months) after arthrodesis of the lumbar or lumbosacral spine with pedicle screw-plate fixation for painful degenerative arthritis, spondylolisthesis, or pseudarthrosis. The patients rated the clinical result according to an analog scale. Most patients reported a marked decrease in pain and an increase in function, and two-thirds were able to work full time. The result of the operation was regarded as a clinical failure if the patient considered it so, if an additional operation had been done, or if the functional and pain scores were not good (that is, if the patient was not able to work full time and the rating for pain was more than 5 of 10 points). Seventeen (28 per cent) of the patients were considered to have a clinical failure, with the lowest rate (20 per cent) for patients who had painful degenerative arthritis and the highest rate (47 per cent) for patients who had had a pseudarthrosis before the operation. The rate of fusion was 90 per cent in patients who had painful degenerative disease, 93 per cent in patients who had spondylolisthesis, and 65 per cent in patients who had had a pseudarthrosis preoperatively. 
Severe hypertension with segmental renal infarction following surgical removal of a retroperitoneal malignant hemangiopericytoma: a case report. Severe hypertension developed in a fifty-five year-old woman after surgical removal of a retroperitoneal tumor, when the renal artery was injured. Renal arteriography after the surgery demonstrated a segmental infarction of the right kidney. A close relationship between activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the development of severe hypertension was observed. Satisfactory control of blood pressure concomitant with reduction of plasma renin activity was achieved by a combination of an angiotensin-converting anzyme inhibitor, beta-blocking agent, and calcium-entry blocker. The mechanism of activation of the renin-angiotensin system in renal infarction is discussed. 
Allodynia-like effects in rat after ischaemic spinal cord injury photochemically induced by laser irradiation. We report behaviours suggesting the presence of allodynia elicited by non-noxious brushing and mechanical pressure following photochemically induced ischaemic spinal cord injury in the rat. Female rats were intravenously injected with Erythrosin B and the T10 vertebra was irradiated with a laser beam for 1, 5 or 10 min. These procedures initiated an intravascular photochemical reaction, resulting in ischaemic spinal cord injury. After irradiation a clear allodynia was observed in most rats. The animals vocalized intensely to light touch during gentle handling and were clearly agitated to light brushing of the flanks. The vocalization threshold in response to the mechanical pressure measured with von Frey hairs was markedly decreased during this period. In some animals the existence of spontaneous pain was suggested by spontaneous vocalization. The duration of the allodynia varied among animals from several hours to several days. The severity and duration of allodynia seemed not to be related to the duration of irradiation. In sham-operated rats a slight, transient allodynia was also noted around the wound within a few hours after surgery, which was effectively relieved by systemic morphine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Morphine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) also partially relieved the allodynia in spinally injured rats 4 h after irradiation. However, morphine, even at a higher dose (5 mg/kg, i.p.), failed to alleviate the allodynia in spinally injured rats 24-48 h after the injury. Systemic injection of the GABAB agonist baclofen (0.01-0.1 mg/kg, i.p.), but not the GABAA agonist muscimol (1 mg/kg, i.p.), effectively relieved allodynia during this period. Pretreatment with guanethidine 24 h and just prior to the irradiation (20 mg/kg, s.c.) did not prevent the occurrence of allodynia in spinal cord injured rats. The present observation is the first to show that ischaemic spinal cord injury could result in cutaneous mechanical allodynia. This phenomenon is resistant to morphine and may not involve the sympathetic system. Histological examination of allodynic animals 3 days after spinal cord injury revealed considerable morphological damage in the dorsal spinal cord of a rat irradiated for 5 min. The related dorsal roots were also slightly affected in this animal, while the dorsal root ganglia were normal. However, in rats irradiated for 1 min, despite the existence of strong allodynia, no damage could be found at this time in the spinal cord, dorsal roots or dorsal root ganglia. It is suggested that functional deficits in the GABAB system in the spinal cord may be related to this allodynia-like phenomenon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Cytokine content in pleural effusion. Comparison between tuberculous and carcinomatous pleurisy. Tuberculous pleurisy is a good model for resolution of local cellular immunity. It would be expected that tuberculous pleural fluid contains a variety of immunologically important cytokines because of the accumulation of immunocompetent cells in the pleural cavity. We studied interleukin 1 (IL-1), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in pleural fluid of 20 patients with tuberculous pleurisy and compared them with those in pleural fluid of 20 patients with malignant pleurisy. We also evaluated adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels in both effusions. Tuberculous pleural fluid had higher levels of IL-1, IL-2, IFN-gamma, and ADA than malignant pleural fluid. Although the difference of IL-1 level between tuberculous and malignant pleural fluid was modest, that of IL-2, IFN-gamma, and ADA was dominant. These findings suggest that activated T lymphocytes in tuberculous pleural fluid concern the production of lymphokines at the morbid site and they effectively exert local cellular immunity through the action of such lymphokines. 
The acetylcholine-induced flare response in evaluation of small fiber dysfunction. We iontophoresed acetylcholine on the dorsum of the foot and simultaneously measured flare and sweat responses using laser Doppler and sudorometric techniques, respectively. We compared these responses with those induced by histamine. Both acetylcholine and histamine produced dose-dependent flare, but only acetylcholine produced sweat responses. Responses to acetylcholine and histamine were blocked by hexamethonium chloride and pyrilamine maleate, respectively (p less than 0.01). We compared flare and sweat responses in 26 control subjects, 21 asymptomatic diabetic patients and 41 patients (17 diabetic, 24 nondiabetic) with pain symptoms suggestive of small fiber neuropathy and normal sensation (n = 15) or mild to moderate (n = 19) or severe (n = 7) sensory loss. No patient had trophic foot lesions. Basal skin blood flow and maximal flare responses were not significantly different among the various subgroups (Control subjects, 49 +/- 7.4; asymptomatic diabetic patients, 29 +/- 4; patients with small fiber neuropathy and normal sensation, 34 +/- 6; with neuropathy and mild to moderate sensory loss, 29 +/- 4.8; and with neuropathy and severe sensory loss, 35 +/- 5 ml/100 gm, for flare response, respectively). Flare responses lower than the lowest found in control subjects occurred in 5 of 21 asymptomatic diabetic patients, 4 of 15 patients with small fiber neuropathy and normal sensation, 5 of 19 with neuropathy and mild to moderate sensory loss, and 1 of 7 with neuropathy and severe sensory loss. 
Idiopathic gastroparesis in patients with unexplained nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting are symptoms sometimes associated with motor dysfunction. We compared a group of young patients suffering from chronic nausea and/or vomiting and normal upper gastrointestinal x-ray series with a control group. The members of both groups underwent isotopic examinations of their stomachs. The aim of the study was to find a simple method of checking the stomach and proving a motor dysfunction in a group of patients with chronic, inexplicable nausea and vomiting. Patients and controls fasted for at least 6 hr were given 0.5 mCI of [99mTc] diethylene triaminopentaacetic acid orally in 150 cc milk with 50 g cornflakes. A time-activity curve was obtained and radioactivity over the stomach was recorded exponentially. The parameter of the T1/2 emptying time was used. In normal controls T1/2 emptying time ranged from 18 to 26 min. Twenty-five symptomatic patients were examined, three of whom achieved normal values, but 22 patients showed pathologic results ranging from 36 to 184 min. In patients with chronic nausea and/or vomiting an isotopic examination of the stomach may provide a simple and rapid diagnostic method of evaluation. 
Interrelationship between coagulant activity and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) system in acute ischaemic heart disease. Possible role of the endothelium. Patients with unstable angina pectoris (UAP; n = 20) and acute myocardial infarction (AMI; n = 34) were studied in the acute phase of ischaemic heart disease. We found significantly higher levels of thrombin-antithrombin-III (TAT) complexes, lower levels of systemic tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, and higher levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) activity in the AMI patients compared to the UAP patients. In contrast to these specific changes, general acute phase reactants such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor did not differ significantly between the two groups. Studies of the relationship between coagulation (TAT-complexes) and fibrinolysis data revealed a significant positive correlation between plasma antigen concentrations of TAT-complexes and t-PA (P less than 0.02), and between TAT-complexes and PAI-I (P less than 0.002). These observations indicate a common pathophysiological mechanism underlying the changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis, suggesting that coagulation activity and t-PA-related fibrinolysis are interrelated processes in vivo, and probably take place at the level of the endothelial cell. 
Spike voltage topography identifies two types of frontotemporal epileptic foci. We characterized voltage topography of frontotemporal EEG spikes in 24 patients with complex partial seizures and identified two distinct patterns. "Type 1" spikes possessed a "dipolar" field with a negative region over the inferolateral temporal scalp and a positive region over the contralateral, centroparietal scalp. "Type 2" spikes showed only a broad, frontotemporal negative field. One or the other spike type predominated in all but two patients. Correlations with clinical data and intracranial EEG suggest that type 2 spikes arise from temporal or frontal neocortex, while type 1 spikes involve mesial temporal structures as well as lateral cortex. 
Management of chiasmal and hypothalamic gliomas of infancy and childhood with chemotherapy. Between March, 1983, and February, 1989, 19 infants or children with chiasmal/hypothalamic gliomas were treated with chemotherapy after either surgical or radiological diagnosis. The patients ranged in age from 15 weeks to 15.6 years (median 3.2 years) at the start of therapy. Twelve patients were treated immediately after diagnosis because of progressive symptoms, and seven received chemotherapy after either radiographic progression or clinical deterioration, including progressive visual loss or intracranial hypertension. Based on biopsy results, seven of these tumors were classified as juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas, two as astrocytomas, two as highly anaplastic astrocytomas, and one as a subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma. There was associated neurofibromatosis in four patients. The two initial patients were treated with either actinomycin D and vincristine or 5-fluorouracil, hydroxyurea, and 6-thioguanine. The remaining patients received nitrosourea-based therapy; 15 evaluable patients were treated with a five-drug regimen that included 6-thioguanine, procarbazine, dibromodulcitol, 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea (CCNU), and vincristine and one received 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and 5-fluorouracil. Fifteen of the 18 evaluable patients initially managed with chemotherapy either responded to therapy or their condition stabilized. Median time to tumor progression has not been reached at a median follow-up period of 79 weeks (range 6.6 to 303 weeks), and no tumor-related death has occurred with a median follow-up period of 79 weeks (range 18 to 322 weeks) from the initiation of therapy. The four patients who failed therapy or whose disease progressed after chemotherapy were treated satisfactorily with radiation therapy. Initial improvement or stabilization of visual function was obtained in 16 patients. Endocrine function remained stable in all patients during treatment, although three patients required pharmacological treatment for endocrinopathy that was present at diagnosis. These preliminary results suggest that nitrosourea-based cytotoxic regimens are useful for the initial treatment of children with chiasmal/hypothalamic gliomas, and allow potentially harmful radiation therapy to be deferred until progression of disease. 
Acute stimulation of renin secretion changes the multiple form profile of active plasma renin. Active renin is composed of multiple forms with variable isoelectric points. In this study, the relative proportions of five major active renin forms in human peripheral venous plasma were compared before and 2 h after stimulation of renin secretion with both converting enzyme inhibition (quinapril) and upright posture in five patients with essential hypertension. The five major active renin forms were separated by shallow gradient isoelectric focusing and quantitated by radioimmunoassay of generated angiotensin I. Plasma renin activity increased from 1.2 to 5.1 ng AI/mL/h (P less than .05). This was accompanied by a significant increase in the proportions of the two most basic renin forms and a significant decrease in the proportion of the most acidic form in venous plasma. Although the mechanism cannot be determined from this study, the altered renin form profile observed could have resulted from preferential renal secretion and/or altered hepatic extraction of the more basic forms. An altered renin form profile in response to acute stimulation has important physiologic implications. Since the relatively basic renin forms are preferentially degraded they possess shorter half-lives. Additionally, the multiple forms of active renin may be functionally heterogenous. Thus, acute stimulation of renin secretion may result in circulating renin with a shorter duration of action and different functional effects than renin released under steady state conditions. 
Detection of tissue injury after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy of gallstones. We evaluated seven patients undergoing gallstone lithotripsy for evidence of hepatic or renal trauma after each of 10 lithotripsy treatments. Postlithotripsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sonography showed no evidence of hepatic or renal injury as compared with baseline studies. Four treatments resulted in sonographic evidence of gaseous hepatic microbubbles (analogous to "the bends") due to cavitation effects of the shockwaves. Three of these four treatments produced serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase and -pyruvic transaminase elevation. One patient had microscopic hematuria. Minimal tissue damage results from gallstone lithotripsy. MRI and ultrasound, performed after lithotripsy, appear to be less sensitive than transaminasemia in detecting this low-grade injury. 
Noncemented porous-coated anatomic total hip arthroplasty. In 1984, as an alternate to the acrylic fixation of the components of total hip arthroplasty, the use of an uncemented porous-coated anatomic (PCA) hip system with a beaded porous coating to achieve biologic fixation was initiated. Since then, 44 patients with cementless acetabular components and 35 patients with cementless femoral components have been followed for a minimum of 24 months and an average of 37 months. Harris hip scores averaged 90.5 at most recent follow-up intervals. No reoperations were necessary for failures of fixation or change in position of the acetabular component. Ominous roentgenographic signs such as progressive bead shedding, progressive radiolucencies, or progressive component migration have not occurred. Two femoral component revisions have been necessary: one for intractable pain and one for pain and roentgenographic loosening. Although thigh pain has been prevalent (20%), all patients have been accommodated and have retained stable hip scores. Progressive radiolucencies and progressive implant subsidence have been rare occurrences. The authors continue to use the cementless acetabular component in all cases of total hip arthroplasty in which initial stability can be obtained. It is their preference to cement the femoral component in patients over 65 or when initial stability cannot be achieved. 
Aortic dissection resulting from tear of transverse arch: is concomitant arch repair warranted? Forty-seven patients with aortic dissection resulting from a primary tear located in the transverse aortic arch underwent surgical treatment. Twenty-six patients had acute type A, 7 had acute type B, 7 had chronic type A, and 7 had chronic type B aortic dissections. Of the 33 patients with acute dissections, 11 (7 acute type A and 4 acute type B) underwent concomitant arch repair with an operative (less than or equal to 30 days) mortality rate of 55% (35% to 73%, +/- 1 asymmetric 70% confidence limit) (2 of 7 acute type A and 4 of 4 acute type B). Concomitant arch repair was omitted in 22 patients with acute dissections (19 acute type A and 3 acute type B); the operative mortality rate was 41% (29% to 54%) (7 of 19 acute type A and 2 of 3 acute type B) (p = not significant versus arch repair). The overall survival rate for those with arch repair was 45% +/- 15% (+/- 1 standard error of the estimate) at 4 years, compared with 43% +/- 11% for patients without arch repair (p = not significant). Considering the type of dissection, the 4-year survival estimate for patients with acute type A dissections who underwent arch repair (5 hemiarch and 2 total arch) was 71% +/- 17% (versus 44% +/- 12% for acute type A patients without arch repair). There were no survivors among the 4 patients with acute type B dissections who had an arch repair (1 hemiarch and 3 total arch), whereas patients with acute type B dissections who did not undergo concomitant arch repair had a 4-year survival estimate of 33% +/- 27% (p = not significant versus arch repair). Four other patients with acute type B dissections resulting from an arch tear were managed medically and tended to have a slightly better prognosis (2-year survival estimate of 75% +/- 22% versus 14% +/- 13% for all surgically treated acute type B patients), but again this difference was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis of the 47 surgical patients revealed that advanced age (p = 0.0008), preoperative dissection complications (p = 0.02), and other coexistent medical problems (p = 0.03) were the only significant, independent determinants of overall mortality. Initial arch repair was not a significant predictor. Nine percent (2/22) of patients with acute type A dissections who initially underwent isolated ascending aortic replacement required subsequent arch replacement; 1 died after reoperation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The failed ulnar nerve transposition. Etiology and treatment. Various procedures have been recommended for the treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome. Simple decompression in situ, medial epicondylectomy, subcutaneous transposition, intramuscular transposition, and submuscular transposition all have their advocates. The results of the surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome are related to the severity of the compressive neuropathy at the time of diagnosis and to the adequate decompression of the nerve at all sites of potential compression at the time of surgical treatment. Fourteen patients who had previously undergone surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome were evaluated because of persistent pain, paresthesia, numbness, and motor weakness. All patients had documented persistent compression of the ulnar nerve on clinical and electromyographic evaluation. The indication for repeat surgical exploration in all patients was unremitting pain despite nonoperative treatment. All patients had been treated by neurolysis and submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve as described by Learmonth. The causes of continued pain after initial surgery included retention of the medial intermuscular septum, dense perineural fibrosis of the nerve after intramuscular and subcutaneous transposition, adhesions of the nerve to the medial epicondylectomy site, and recurrent subluxation of the nerve over the medial epicondyle after subcutaneous transposition. Revision surgery was found to be highly successful for relief of pain and paresthesias; however, the recovery of motor function and return of sensibility were variable and unpredictable. 
C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency: three presentations [clinical conference] We have presented three patients representing three of the four reported forms of C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. The C1INH deficiencies are in general distinguishable from each other and from other forms of angioedema by their complement patterns. The acquired C1INH deficiency must be part of the differential in patients without a family history of angioedema since it may precede the diagnosis of more serious medical conditions such as lymphoproliferative disorders. 
Value of electrocardiographic leads MCL1, MCL6 and other selected leads in the diagnosis of wide QRS complex tachycardia. To compare the modified precordial leads MCL1 and MCL6 with the conventional precordial leads V1 and V6 and assess the diagnostic accuracy of selected leads for continuous bedside electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, 121 wide QRS complex tachycardias were recorded from 92 patients during cardiac electrophysiologic study. As ascertained from intracardiac recordings, 86 tachycardias were ventricular and 35 were supraventricular with aberrant conduction. Early or late peaking of the predominant QRS deflection in lead MCL6 or V6 proved valuable in diagnosing wide complex tachycardia. An interval of less than or equal to 50 ms from the onset of the QRS complex to the predominant peak (or nadir) indicated supraventricular tachycardia; an interval of greater than or equal to 70 ms indicated ventricular tachycardia. The QRS complexes in leads MCL1 and MCL6 were comparable to those in leads V1 and V6 during sinus rhythm. Significant discrepancies in QRS configuration occurred between the modified and conventional precordial leads during ventricular tachycardia, especially between leads MCL1 and V1; however. these differences did not affect diagnostic accuracy. A single MCL1, V1, MCL6 or V6 lead was equally valuable in the diagnosis of wide complex tachycardia and far superior to a single lead II. A combination of leads (MCL1 + MCL6), (V1 + V6), (V1 + I + aVF) or (V1 + V6 + I + aVF) was superior to a single lead or the routinely monitored lead V1 + II combination. 
A physiologic basis for the provision of fuel mixtures in normal and stressed patients. It has been suggested that lipid is a preferred fuel in stressed patients. We evaluated glucose oxidation in 20 patients (sepsis, cancer of the colon, multiple trauma, controls) while they received TPN (5.65 mg glucose/kg/min). Respiratory quotient (RQ) was measured by indirect calorimetry and the percent VCO2 arising from the oxidation of glucose was measured using [U-14C] glucose. Since RQs were 1.0 or greater in all patients, the nonprotein energy utilized by them was calculated to be derived completely from glucose. However, the kinetic data showed that glucose contributed only 55-60% of the VCO2. Protein oxidation contributed less than 20% of the VCO2, as calculated from urinary nitrogen. The difference must have been derived from fatty acid oxidation. The glucose turnover that was not oxidized was presumed to be converted to lipid at an RQ of 8.6. The net oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production from this overall distribution resulted in an RQ of about 1.0 with only 60% coming from glucose oxidation. Since all patients responded in the same manner, it appears that the proper ratio of glucose and lipid was dictated on a physiologic basis and not on the type of disease. 
Mucosal vascular stasis precedes loss of viability of endothelial cells in rat acetic acid colitis. The hypothesis that a significant reduction in colonic mucosal perfusion, and hence ischemic injury, precedes the development of mucosal ulceration and inflammation is tested in this report. The microcirculatory changes in the rat colonic mucosa within 1 hr of topical exposure to 10% acetic acid were assessed. Colonic mucosal blood flow signals measured by laser Doppler flowmetry were significantly reduced to 61 +/- 8, 52 +/- 10, and 37 +/- 13% (mean +/- SEM) of baseline values at 1 min, 4 min, and 10 min after the colonic mucosa was exposed to 10% acetic acid, respectively, but not in controls exposed to saline. After the start of application of 10% acetic acid (for 4 min), in vivo microscopy studies demonstrated that colonic mucosal ischemia (stasis of the red blood cells in the mucosal capillaries) occurred at 9 +/- 5 min (mean +/- SEM). Evidence of endothelial cell death (failure to exclude a fluorescent dye, propidium iodide, by endothelial cells) developed at 25 +/- 10 min (mean +/- SEM). These findings indicate that within minutes after contact of the colonic mucosa with 10% acetic acid, colonic mucosal ischemia develops, followed shortly by death of endothelial cells. The data do not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the reductions in mucosal blood flow and loss of endothelial cell viability in response to acetic acid. Nevertheless, because these events occur at such an early time point, they may play a pathogenetic role in the development of the subsequent inflammatory and ulcerative changes in this animal model of colitis. Further studies to define the potential causal relationships between these parameters are warranted. 
Sternotomy infection: poor prediction by acute phase response and delayed hypersensitivity. Two hundred twenty-one consecutive adult cardiac surgical patients were examined prospectively for nutritional protein state, acute phase protein response, and delayed hypersensitivity reaction in an attempt to identify patients at high risk for the development of sternal wound infection, which occurred in 6 patients (2.7%). There was no significant correlation between preoperative nutritional protein concentrations (retinol-binding protein, prealbumin, and transferrin) and acute phase protein levels (C-reactive protein, alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, and complements B and C3), nor a statistically significant relationship between nutritional state or acute phase protein response and the development of sternal infection. Preoperative complement C3 levels were elevated, however, in 80.0% of those in whom sternal infections developed compared with 30.6% of those with well-healed wounds. Similarly, postoperative concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein were elevated in 80.0% of those in whom sternal infections developed compared with 28.6% of those with well-healed wounds. There was no correlation between delayed hypersensitivity and the risk of sternal infection, nor between preoperative nutritional protein and acute phase protein values. Seventy-three percent of patients were anergic on postoperative day 2. Stepwise logistic regression showed that age, body weight, preoperative intensive care unit stay, repeat median sternotomy, internal mammary artery grafting, postoperative hemorrhage, and postoperative cardiac arrest correlated with the development of sternal infection, whereas transfusion requirement, reexploration for bleeding, and the operation performed did not. We conclude that routine delayed hypersensitivity testing is of no value in predicting high-risk cardiac surgical patients when the anergy battery is placed on the preoperative day. Although statistically insignificant, possibly due to the small number of patients in whom sternal infection developed in this study (type II error), a larger study might find preoperative complement C3 and post-operative alpha 1-acid glycoprotein levels to be predictive of patients at risk for the development of sternal wound infection. The final logistic model for the predicted risk 2%) of sternal wound infection is: PREDSWC = exp(EQ)/1 + exp(EQ) where EQ = (0.38 x age) + (0.24 x weight) + (5.42 x preop ICU) + (4.39 x redo) + (7.14 x IMA) + (4.49 x hemorrhage) + (8.81 x arrest) - 62.72, and where preop ICU, redo, hemorrhage, and arrest are defined as yes (1) or no (0), IMA-is defined as 0, 1, or 2, age is in years, and weight is in kilograms. 
Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection, tearing, etc. (SUNCT): III. Another Norwegian case. "SUNCT" is a recently reported head pain syndrome characterized by shortlasting, unilateral neuralgiform paroxysms with conjunctival injection and tearing, and to a lesser extent nasal secretion, and (subclinical) sweating. Another case--that of a 56 year old male--is reported herein. The attacks lasted 1/2-1 min. and occurred only infrequently, i.e. once or twice in 1-4 weeks, except for a week recently when there were up to 20 or more typical attacks per day, with the usual ipsilateral, autonomic accompaniments. Due to the benign nature and low frequency of attacks, the diagnosis would have been most difficult to establish prior to the occurrence of this shortlasting period with more marked symptoms. A variety of precipitation mechanisms were present, partly concerning the V 2-3 areas, partly concerning the neck. Precipitation mechanisms in "SUNCT" to some extent seem to differ from those in trigeminal neuralgia. It is remarkable that all four hitherto reported cases are males. 
Cor triatriatum dexter: recognition and percutaneous transluminal correction. Cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital anomaly in which an obstructive membrane is located in the right atrium. The detection usually occurs after the sequelae of systemic congestion, coagulopathy, and hepatic dysfunction have set in, leading up to a high surgical risk. A percutaneous balloon correction of cor triatriatum dexter in a patient with advanced right-sided congestive symptoms and hepatic dysfunction is presented. This efficacious method is an alternative to surgical correction and could be extended to the more common cor triatriatum sinistra. 
High-dose cytarabine for intensification of early therapy of childhood acute myeloid leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. In June 1984, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) initiated a pilot study (8498) using high-dose cytarabine (HdA; 3 g/m2) for intensification of early therapy in childhood acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (group I). Remission induction therapy consisted of two courses of daunorubicin, cytarabine (Ara-C), and thioguanine (DAT). Postremission therapy consisted of four sequential courses, each consisting of (1) four doses of HdA (HdA4) followed by asparaginase (L-Asp), (2) etoposide (VP) plus azacytidine (Az), (3) prednisone, vincristine, methotrexate, and mercaptopurine (POMP), and (4) Ara-C daily for 5 days by continuous infusion. Six doses of intrathecal Ara-C were given for CNS prophylaxis. In December 1986, the protocol was amended (group II) to substitute six doses of HdA (HdA6) for the second DAT (two + five) induction course; postinduction, a single course of HdA6 was given instead of four HdA/L-Asp courses, and the remainder of the therapy was unchanged. One hundred forty group I patients and 145 group II patients were assessable. The two groups were similar with regard to clinical prognostic groups. No significant differences were noted in the two groups with regard to remission induction (85% [SE = 2%] in each group), induction deaths (6.5% v 7.0%), or deaths in remission (one in each group). Cerebellar toxicity was reported in three patients in group II (with HdA6) but none in group I (HdA4). At present, patients who received HdA6 (group II) had higher event-free survival than patients in group I (EFS at 3 years, 34% [SE = 11%] v 29% [SE = 4%]), and disease-free survival (DFS at 3 years, 42% [SE = 14%] v 34% [SE = 4%]), but the differences were not statistically significant. In both groups, children less than 2 years and those with WBCs less than 100,000/microL had significantly better outcome (EFS of 55% [SE = 10%] and 36% [SE = 5%] at 3 years, respectively) than children greater than or equal to 2 years and those with WBCs greater than or equal to 100,000/microL (EFS of 27% [SE = 5%] and 20% [SE = 9%] at 3 years, respectively. 
Chronic cough in infants and children: an update. Cough is a symptom frequently encountered by the otolaryngologist--head and neck surgeon. Although most coughs are self limited, chronic cough often proves to be a frustrating problem. Seventy-two infants and children under age 16 with a normal chest radiogram have now been evaluated for chronic cough persisting for longer than 4 weeks. Cough-variant asthma was the most common cause of cough, followed by sinusitis, gastroesophageal reflux, aberrant innominate artery, psychogenic cough, and subglottic stenosis. Chronic cough is best managed by first following an individualized diagnostic protocol designed to determine the etiology of the cough. This is followed by specific therapy to treat the underlying disorder. Children with persistent cough and normal chest radiograph are best served when referred promptly for evaluation by an otolaryngologist when the primary physician's initial efforts at diagnosis and treatment are not effective. Endoscopy is underutilized in practice and its importance understated in the literature. It is particularly helpful in establishing a precise diagnosis in infants under 18 months of age. 
Failure of wild-type or a mutant form of protein kinase C-alpha to transform fibroblasts. A mutant form of the alpha-isoform of protein kinase C (PKC) was recently isolated from an ultraviolet radiation-induced murine fibrosarcoma cell line and reported to transform mouse BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts on transfection. Four point mutations in the regulatory domain were assumed to be responsible for its oncogenicity and unusual preference for membrane localization. Here, we report that overexpression of the reported mutant PKC alpha complementary DNA in three fibroblast cell lines, including BALB/c 3T3, does not enable these cells to grow in soft agar or nude mice. In addition, this mutant PKC alpha form seems to be indistinguishable from the wild-type PKC alpha with respect to its dependence on cofactors, phorbol ester binding, subcellular distribution and its effects on growth and morphology. These results fail to confirm the previous study and indicate that overexpression of either the wild-type or the reported mutant form of PKC alpha does not transform rodent fibroblasts. 
The role of vaginal scan in measurement of endometrial thickness in postmenopausal women. Transvaginal ultrasound scanning was performed on 111 postmenopausal women. Of these women, 103 had postmenopausal bleeding, and eight were undergoing hysterectomy. Of the 103 women with bleeding, 93 had dilatation and curettage (D&C) and 10 patients were treated conservatively with a repeat scan in six months. A correlation of ultrasound findings and endometrial histopathology was possible in 94 patients. In 59 of these (63%) the endometrium was atrophic and the ultrasound endometrial thickness was 5 mm or less. In 29 (31%) patients the endometrial histology was abnormal and ultrasound endometrial thickness was greater than 5 mm. In six patients the endometrium was atrophic, but the ultrasonic endometrial thickness was apparently greater than 5 mm due to intracavity fluid. We suggest that an endometrial thickness of 5 mm is an appropriate cut-off level for conservative management of patients with postmenopausal bleeding, or in screening for endometrial carcinoma. 
Treatment of 813 zygoma-lateral orbital complex fractures. New aspects. A 10-year experience with surgical treatment of 813 zygomalateral orbital complex fractures is reviewed. Regardless of the type or severity of the fracture pattern, concomitant fractures of the orbital floor and rim were approached exclusively through the transconjunctival approach without a lateral canthotomy. The advantages of this approach compared with the subciliary access are the avoidance of a visible scar and markedly reduced incidence of postoperative lower eyelid complications such as ectropion and edema. Implants of lyophilized dura or cartilage and autogenous bone were used to reconstruct orbital floor defects. Malar asymmetry is a frequent complication of zygoma fractures resulting from inadequate three-dimensional reduction. Methods for accurate reduction and stabilization, indications for closed and open reduction, and management of the fractured infraorbital rim are emphasized. The indications for miniplates vs wire ligatures for the infraorbital rim are discussed. Long-term follow up and evaluation of the results with regard to the fracture pattern, complications, maxillary sinus dysfunction, and facial and orbital symmetry are presented. 
Prevention of portal hypertension and portosystemic shunts by early chronic administration of clonidine in conscious portal vein-stenosed rats. The hemodynamic effects, including mesenteric-systemic shunts of early chronic administration of clonidine, were studied in conscious, unrestrained, portal vein-stenosed rats. In rats receiving early chronic clonidine (600 micrograms.kg-1.day-1 by gavage), begun 3 days before portal vein stenosis and then administered continuously for 10 consecutive days, portal pressure (10.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) and degree of mesenteric-systemic shunts (58% +/- 25%) were significantly lower than in the placebo group (15.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg and 83% +/- 7%, respectively). The effects were observed either 2 to 3 hr or 18 to 24 hr after the last dose of clonidine. In rats receiving clonidine continuously for 5 days, starting 5 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) was significantly lower than in the placebo group, but mesenteric-systemic shunts (82% +/- 8%) were not significantly different. In rats receiving a single oral dose of clonidine (600 micrograms/kg) 10 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg), measured 2 to 3 hr after clonidine administration, was significantly lower than in the placebo group. Mesenteric-systemic shunts (83% +/- 8%), however, were not significantly different from the placebo group. In addition, 18 to 24 hr after a single dose of clonidine, hemodynamic values returned to basal conditions. We also demonstrated that chronic clonidine administration begun before portal vein stenosis can reduce the initial increase in portal pressure after this procedure. We concluded that early chronic clonidine administration reduces the severity of portal hypertension and the development of portosystemic shunts in portal vein-stenosed rats. 
Extramedullary blast crisis in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Demonstration of T-cell lineage and Philadelphia chromosome in a paraspinal tumor. A case of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) with penetrance of the Ph1 molecular alteration into the T-cell lineage of a paraspinal tumor is reported. The T-cell nature of the paraspinal tumor was documented by immunochemical study and genotyping. The Philadelphia chromosome was also detected by genotyping in the same tumor cell population. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first case of extramedullary T-cell blast crisis in CML demonstrated in an extranodal tumor. The clinical significance of detecting extramedullary blast crisis, and the theories for the scarcity of T-cell transformation in CML are discussed. 
An unknown syndrome of nose deformity, oxycephaly, aplasia of the nasolacrimal ducts, and symmetrical cyst formation on the upper lip in siblings: craniorhiny. An unknown syndrome of oxycephaly, nose deformity, hair growth on the skin at the base of the nose, symmetrical cyst formation on the upper lip, and aplasia of the nasolacrimal ducts in a mother and her three children is presented. This syndrome showed autosomal dominant inheritance. All three children were operated on. Oxycephaly and lip deformity in two of the children and hypertelorism that existed in addition to the other anomalies in the third were all corrected. All corrective surgery was performed during a single session for each child. 
Phrenic nerve injury in infants and children undergoing cardiac surgery. Fifty infants and 50 children less than 15 years undergoing palliative or corrective cardiac surgery in the Brompton Hospital between March and October 1988 had direct percutaneous stimulation of the phrenic nerve before and after operation. Ten patients, six under 1 year of age and four over, developed unilateral phrenic nerve injury. In those aged less than 1 year recovery after operation was prolonged because their diaphragmatic palsy made it difficult to wean them from the ventilator. Older children had symptoms but their rate of recovery did not seem to be affected by the phrenic nerve injury. Phrenic nerve damage was no more frequent after a lateral thoracotomy than after a median sternotomy. There was no significant association with the type of operation performed, the experience of the surgeon, the use of bypass or topical ice, the duration of bypass, circulatory arrest or aortic cross clamping, or the age of the patient at the time of operation. In patients who had cardiopulmonary bypass the risk of injury was significantly higher in those who had undergone previous operation. The 10% frequency of phrenic nerve injury determined in this prospective study was higher than that seen in earlier retrospective reports. Direct percutaneous stimulation of the phrenic nerve can be used at the bedside in infants and children to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of phrenic nerve palsy, and the results may influence early management. 
Benefits of monitoring plasma levodopa in Parkinson's disease patients with drug-induced chorea. We studied the temporal patterns of chorea and plasma levodopa profiles in 30 patients with Parkinson's disease whose motor fluctuations were difficult to characterize and treat on the basis of observation alone. We were able to determine whether chorea was associated with high levodopa concentrations or low levodopa concentrations or both. We found the following patterns of levodopa-associated chorea: chorea due to inadequate levodopa levels, chorea due to biphasic levodopa absorption, chorea associated with either rapid or slow levodopa absorption, and chorea due to long-duration levodopa absorption mimicking a sustained-release preparation. Seven patients benefited after their dosing schedules were rearranged as a result of information gained from monitoring. We conclude that any patient with levodopa-associated chorea who cannot be regulated on the basis of observation alone should be studied with simultaneous plasma levodopa measurements and clinical monitoring to detect an unusual plasma levodopa pattern that may be improved by adjustment of dosing schedule. 
Acute nonhemodynamic pulmonary edema with nifedipine in primary pulmonary hypertension. A 34-year-old man with primary pulmonary hypertension developed acute nonhemodynamic pulmonary edema after a loading dose of nifedipine. Changes of the vascular permeability induced by the drug acting on the arteriolar wall of the capillary system could be an explanation. 
Measurement of individual plasma angiotensins in normal pregnancy and pregnancy-induced hypertension. Individual angiotensin peptides were measured by a high pressure liquid chromatography-RIA (HPLC-RIA) technique in the plasma of 20 nonpregnant women, 17 women with normal pregnancy, and 49 with pregnancy-induced hypertension. Immunoreactive angiotensin-II (ANG-II) consisted mainly of ANG-(1-8) octapeptide (greater than 65%), variable proportions (15-25%) of ANG-(4-8) pentapeptide, and small to negligible proportions of ANG-(2-8) heptapeptide and ANG-(3-8) hexapeptide. Levels of ANG-(1-8) were significantly higher in women with normal pregnancy than in both nonpregnant women (P less than 0.0006) and women with pregnancy-induced hypertension (P less than 0.008); in the latter, levels were lower with increasing severity of disease. Levels of ANG-(4-8) were higher in women with normal pregnancy than in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension or nonpregnant women. When expressed as a proportion of ANG-(1-8) levels, however, ANG-(4-8) levels were not higher in normal pregnancy than in women with pregnancy-induced hypertension or nonpregnant women. It is concluded that the well known increase in ANG-II levels in normal pregnancy relates predominantly to the active ANG-(1-8) octapeptide and to a far lesser extent to the smaller ANG peptides. Similarly, lower ANG-II levels in pregnancy-induced hypertension relate predominantly to lower ANG-(1-8) levels. 
Abnormal most-rapid isometric contractions in patients with Parkinson's disease. Fast isometric elbow flexor muscle contractions of specified amplitude in six normal subjects were compared with those of 11 patients with Parkinson's disease. Despite treatment, all patients exhibited deficits in this motor task. Three patients were able to produce rapid force pulses with normal contraction times, but the variability of their force responses was increased in comparison with the highly stereotyped responses produced by normal subjects. The other eight patients had prolonged contraction times and segmentation of the force profiles. The integrated area of the first agonist EMG burst and the rate of development of force (dF/dt) were less at any target level than what was needed to produce a fast response. The area of the EMG burst, however, did increase with target amplitude, and the relative increase of dF/dt, with target amplitude, was normal. It is concluded that the motor program subserving fast muscle contraction is preserved in Parkinson's disease, but its execution is characterised by improper scaling of motor output. 
Dental chair apoplexy. We have reported two cases of intracranial bleeding shortly after a dental procedure. We argue that administration of hypochlorite in gum debridement, application of dental cement, or mechanical stimulation of the alveolar branches of the trigeminal nerve at the pulp may not only result in acute systemic hypertension, but also in the release of vasodilatory neurotransmitters. The combination of a local increase in intracerebral blood flow and simultaneously developing systemic hypertension in an occasional patient may lead to intracranial hemorrhage. 
Epidemiological evidence of the association between lichen planus and two immune-related diseases. Alopecia areata and ulcerative colitis. Gruppo Italiano Studi Epidemiologici in Dermatologia. Between September 1986 and February 1988, a case-control study involving 27 Italian dermatological centers collaborating in the Gruppo Italiano Studi Epidemiologici in Dermatologia was conducted, concerning the relationship between history of several medical conditions and exposures to drugs and the risk of lichen planus. The cases were all consecutive patients with a new diagnosis of lichen planus, and the controls were patients under dermatological care observed under the same conditions. A total of 711 cases and 1395 controls met the admission criteria and were interviewed by trained investigators. Patients with histories of alopecia areata were found to be at risk for lichen planus (relative risk = 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.5). Five patients (0.7%) in the group with lichen planus had a history of ulcerative colitis, while none of the controls had this disease. The risk of lichen planus was also increased in patients with a history of chronic active hepatitis, but this increase was not statistically significant (relative risk = 4.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 29.4). 
Bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism demonstrated in a patient with cerebellar astrocytoma. A case of calcification in the striopallidodentate system associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism, clinically manifested after operation for a cystic astrocytoma of the cerebellar vermis, is reported. Bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification accompanying a disturbance in calcium metabolism is rare. Only a few cases have been described previously in the literature, of which only six were accompanied by pseudohypoparathyroidism. The importance of identifying hypoparathyroidism, especially pseudohypoparathyroidism, early in the course of investigation is discussed. 
Use of echocardiography for patient management in chronic ischemic heart disease. Myocardial ischemia causes regional myocardial contractile and relaxation abnormalities. The extent of ischemia is determined by the distribution and severity of coronary artery stenoses. In coronary heart disease, two powerful predictors of prognosis are the coronary anatomy and ventricular function. Management in coronary heart disease is directed by accurate diagnosis and individualized objectives. Echocardiography at rest and exercise, combined with Doppler and color flow imaging, are properly applied to the differential diagnosis of common clinical syndromes in ischemic heart disease, the identification of the proximal coronary arteries, and the effects of ischemia and prior infarction. Subsequent use of coronary arteriography partially depends on the philosophy regarding the applicability of coronary surgery or angioplasty in an individual patient. Prediction of multivessel, left main, or proximal left anterior descending coronary artery disease by extensive wall motion abnormalities or an abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction may direct the clinician to coronary arteriography to select among coronary surgery, angioplasty, or medical management. 
Alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance as an aid in the management of patients with celiac disease. One hundred and thirty-two different intestinal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance tests were performed in 48 untreated adult celiac patients, 64 patients taking a gluten-free diet, and 20 adult healthy controls. In the untreated group, 95% of patients had enteric protein loss with values higher than the upper limit of normality (mean +/- 2 SD). In the treated group of patients, only 22% had abnormal levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. Sixteen patients who had elevated clearance before treatment had decreased clearance after an average of 7.4 months on a gluten-free diet. There was a significant relation (p less than 0.05) between the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and the degree of alteration of the jejunal histological structure. We conclude that enteric protein loss is a very frequent finding in celiac patients and the measurement of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance may be a reliable method to evaluate the activity of the disease and useful in following the efficacy of treatment. 
Pleomorphic fibroma of skin. A case report and immunohistochemical study. An immunohistochemical study of a clinically benin but cytologically atypical mesenchymal lesion of the skin is presented. This lesion has been previously reported as pleomorphic fibroma and was shown to follow a benign course with a potential for local recurrence. These lesions contain occasional markedly atypical enlarged spindle cells with anaplastic-appearing nuclei. Nonmirror image mitotic figures may be present. Histogenesis of this neoplasm remains controversial with a fibroblastic origin being favored by previous authors. Our immunohistochemical findings would support this conclusion. 
Autosomal dominant deletions of the mitochondrial genome in a case of progressive encephalomyopathy. Multiple deletions of the mitochondrial genome were found in a family in which the proband had ataxia and ketoacidotic comas. A progressive multiorgan involvement appeared in the course of the disease, and histopathological investigation demonstrated mitochondrial myopathy features with ragged red fibers. A defect of oxidative phosphorylation was found in both skeletal muscle and lymphocytes. It is surprising that various mtDNA deletions were detected both in the proband and in his healthy mother and maternal aunt but not in the rest of the maternal progeny. All the deletions were located between Cox II and cytochrome b genes, and short (4-5 bp) repeated sequences were consistently present at the boundaries of the rearrangements in different tissues. Therefore, the deletions appear not to be transmitted per se but to be inherited in a Mendelian manner, being possibly dominant. Both the Mendelian inheritance of the trait and the variety of the deletions in carriers suggest that a nuclearly encoded factor(s) might be involved in the triggering of the deletions. However, the presence of the rearrangements in healthy individuals raises the question of whether mtDNA deletions actually cause the clinical expression of the disease. 
Relationship between perceived self-control of pain, pain description and functioning. Recent research has shown an association between preferred coping style and pain report. The present study explores in a sample of 51 patients with chronic pain of myofascial origin the relationship between a dispositional measure of coping, the internality dimension of the Pain Locus of Control Scale (PLOC), and ratings of pain intensity, frequency, and pain-related behavioral functioning. Patients above the median on the internality dimension of the PLOC reported their pain as less intense and frequent than those below the median. No differences were noted on the behavioral functioning measures. Results are consistent with previous studies and indicate an association between ability to control pain and variations in magnitude and periodicity of pain. The clinical implication of the data is that strategies which provide reduction in pain intensity and frequency might be expected to result in increased perception of personal control of pain. 
Spectrum of intestinal failure in a specialised unit. 300 consecutive admissions over 7 years to a purpose-built intestinal failure unit are reviewed. The commonest underlying condition was Crohn's disease (42%), and the commonest complication precipitating admission was intestinal fistula (42%). Total parenteral nutrition was used in 85% and surgery in 50%. A multidisciplinary approach to management gave a high success rate--90% of patients were discharged from hospital, although nearly 25% needed home parental nutrition. These results suggest that chronic intestinal failure should be managed in specialised units in the same manner as other types of organ failure. 
The dopamine D2 receptor locus as a modifying gene in neuropsychiatric disorders OBJECTIVE.--The A1 allele of the Taq I polymorphism of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) gene has been earlier reported to occur in 69% of alcoholics, compared with 20% of controls. Other research has reported no significant difference in the prevalence of the A1 allele in alcoholics vs controls and no evidence that the DRD2 gene was linked to alcoholism. We hypothesized that these seemingly conflicting results might be because increases in the prevalence of the A1 allele may not be specific to alcoholism. Thus, we examined other disorders frequently associated with alcoholism or those believed to involve defects in dopaminergic neurotransmission. DESIGN.--Case comparison study. To minimize the effect of racial differences in gene frequencies, the study was restricted to non-Hispanic whites. SETTING.--Ambulatory and hospitalized patients. RESULTS.--Among all known controls (n = 314), 77 (24.5%) carried the A1 allele. Of the 69 controls known not to be alcoholics, 10 (14.5%) carried the A1 allele. The prevalence of the A1 allele was significantly increased in patients with Tourette's syndrome (44.9%, n = 147), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (46.2%, n = 104), autism (54.5%, n = 33), alcoholism (42.3%, n = 104), and posttraumatic stress disorder (45.7%, n = 35). After correction for multiple comparisons (requiring P less than .0009 for significance), all remained significant except posttraumatic stress disorder. The prevalence of the A1 allele was not significantly increased in patients with depression, panic attacks, Parkinson's disease, or obesity. The prevalence of the A1 allele in drug addiction and schizophrenia was only significant when compared with that of controls who were not alcoholics, and no correction was made for multiple comparisons. CONCLUSION.--These results suggest the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated with a number of behavior disorders in which it may act as a modifying gene rather than as the primary etiological agent. 
Human abdominal aortic aneurysms. Immunophenotypic analysis suggesting an immune-mediated response. Cellular immunity may play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In this report the potential role of these cells in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms by immunohistochemistry was investigated. Aortic tissues from 32 patients were examined: 4 normal aortas, 6 aortas with occlusive atherosclerotic disease, 17 abdominal aortic aneurysms, and 5 inflammatory abdominal aneurysms. Using monoclonal anti-CD3 (T cells), anti-CD19 (B cells), anti-CD11c (macrophages), anti-CD4 (T helper cells), and anti-CD8 (T suppressor cells), several distinctions among these groups were found. The amount of inflammatory cell infiltrate was as follows: inflammatory aneurysms more than abdominal aortic aneurysms more than occlusive aortas more than normal aortas. CD3-positive T lymphocytes rarely were found in the adventitia of normal or occlusive aortas. In contrast, abdominal aortic aneurysms and inflammatory aneurysms exhibited most of the CD3-positive infiltrates in the adventitia. CD19-positive B lymphocytes were present mainly in the adventitia of all pathologic tissues. The CD4-positive:CD8-positive ratio was greater in abdominal aortic aneurysms and inflammatory aneurysms than in the other groups, both in the adventitia and in the media of the aortas. CD11c-positive macrophages were present throughout the diseased tissues, often surrounded by lymphoid aggregates; the greatest numbers of macrophages were found in the inflammatory aneurysm group. Our data suggests that the aneurysmal disease may progress from occlusive disease and is accompanied by an increase in chronic inflammatory cells as well as a redistribution of these cell types. Therefore it is suggested that aneurysmal disease may represent an immune-mediated event. 
Pulse sounds and measurement of diastolic blood pressure in children. Controversy exists over the value of measuring diastolic blood pressure (BP) in children, and over whether this should be measured at Korotkoff's fourth phase (K4) or fifth phase (K5) of pulse sounds. We measured diastolic BP in 3012 randomly selected Finnish children aged 6-18 years in 1980, and in 2885 of the same individuals in 1983 and 2500 in 1986. BP was measured with a standard mercury sphygmomanometer in 1980 and 1983, and with a random-zero sphygmomanometer in 1986. K4 was consistently absent in 187 individuals (3.2%) in 1980 and 1983, and in 155 individuals (6.2%) in 1986. K5 was absent in only 34 individuals (0.6%) in 1980/83 and 5 (0.2%) in 1986. The difference between mean K4 and K5 diastolic BP varied from 6.5 to 9.2 mm Hg depending upon age. K4 and K5 BPs showed good correlation in all age groups. Reliable and repeatable BP measurements in all age groups of children are best achieved with K5 as the indicator of diastolic BP. 
Effects of diclofenac sodium on intestinal anastomotic healing. Experimental study on the small intestine of rabbits. To study the possible effects of diclofenac sodium on intestinal anastomoses, 48 rabbits were submitted to surgery consisting of two single-layer ileal anastomoses performed with separate propylene 5-0 sutures. The animals were divided at random into two groups (test and control). The animals in the test group were given intramuscular injections of diclofenac sodium at the dose of 3 mg/kg body weight at 24-hour intervals, and the control animals were given injections of an identical amount of 0.9 percent saline. The animals were sacrificed on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th postoperative days for macroscopic evaluation of the peritoneal cavity and of the anastomoses, tensile strength measurement, hydroxyproline determination, and histopathologic examination. The following results were observed: anastomotic dehiscence followed by peritonitis and death in five test animals (20.83 percent) and no control animals; decreased anastomotic tensile strength on the 7th day in test animals (P less than 0.05); delayed acute inflammatory response and onset of fibroblast proliferation in the test group; and similar hydroxyproline levels in both groups. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that diclofenac sodium had a negative effect on intestinal anastomotic healing. 
Effect of the degree of effort on exercise echocardiography for the detection of restenosis after coronary artery angioplasty. To determine whether the accuracy of exercise echocardiography is affected by the degree of effort during exercise, we examined 101 patients who had 6 months earlier undergone successful coronary artery angioplasty, with resting and immediate postexercise echocardiography and same-day coronary angiography. A positive exercise echocardiographic response was defined as the development of a new or worsening wall motion abnormality postexercise, compared with resting wall motion. Significant coronary disease (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) was present in 48 patients, 38 of whom had single-vessel disease and 10 of whom had two-vessel disease. Exercise echocardiography correctly identified 32 patients with significant disease (sensitivity 67%) and 44 patients without significant disease (specificity 83%). The effect of the degree of exercise effort on the sensitivity and specificity of the test was evaluated by three criteria; (1) the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate (MHR), (2) the duration of exercise (DUR), and (3) the double product (DP). To determine the influence of the degree of effort upon sensitivity and specificity, the effort criteria were compared between patients with true positive (TP) tests to those with false negative tests (FN), and in patients with true negative (TN) tests compared with those with false positive (FP) tests. No significant differences were detected in MHR, DUR, or DP between TP versus FN patients or between TN versus FP patients. These results indicate that for symptom-limited exercise echocardiography in postangioplasty patients, neither sensitivity nor specificity is significantly affected by the degree of effort during exercise. 
Quantitative estimation of infarct size by simultaneous dual radionuclide single photon emission computed tomography: comparison with peak serum creatine kinase activity. To test the hypothesis that simultaneous dual energy single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with technetium-99m (99mTc) pyrophosphate and thallium-201 (201TI) can provide an accurate estimate of the size of myocardial infarction and to assess the correlation between infarct size and peak serum creatine kinase activity, 165 patients with acute myocardial infarction underwent SPECT 3.2 +/- 1.3 (SD) days after the onset of acute myocardial infarction. In the present study, the difference in the intensity of 99mTc-pyrophosphate accumulation was assumed to be attributable to difference in the volume of infarcted myocardium, and the infarct volume was corrected by the ratio of the myocardial activity to the osseous activity to quantify the intensity of 99mTc-pyrophosphate accumulation. The correlation of measured infarct volume with peak serum creatine kinase activity was significant (r = 0.60, p less than 0.01). There was also a significant linear correlation between the corrected infarct volume and peak serum creatine kinase activity (r = 0.71, p less than 0.01). Subgroup analysis showed a high correlation between corrected volume and peak creatine kinase activity in patients with anterior infarctions (r = 0.75, p less than 0.01) but a poor correlation in patients with inferior or posterior infarctions (r = 0.50, p less than 0.01). In both the early reperfusion and the no reperfusion groups, a good correlation was found between corrected infarct volume and peak serum creatine kinase activity (r = 0.76 and r = 0.76, respectively; p less than 0.01). 
Can iodine-131 whole-body scan be replaced by thyroglobulin measurement in the post-surgical follow-up of differentiated thyroid carcinoma? This study compared serum thyroglobulin measurement and whole-body scans in the post-surgical follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Thyroglobulin levels were measured in 61 patients receiving L-thyroxine therapy after thyroidectomy, and again after suspension of therapy, before performing a whole-body scan with iodine-131. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of thyroglobulin levels, measured during L-thyroxine therapy, for diagnosis of tumor residue or metastases were then calculated and compared with results obtained by diagnostic whole-body scanning. Our data show that neither thyroglobulin levels nor whole-body scans alone can discriminate between patients with or without metastases. Sensitivity reached 95.7%, specificity 100%, and accuracy 96.7% if results of both procedures were also taken into consideration. We conclude that in the management and follow-up of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma both parameters need to be evaluated. 
Effect of age on fever response to recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha in a murine model. Certain elderly humans show a blunted fever response to infection. A study was designed using a murine model to assess the influence of age on the febrile response to the endogenous pyrogen, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha). Twenty (10 young: 4-6 months; 10 old: 24-28 months) BALB/c mice were injected with 50 ng of TNF alpha into the intraperitoneal space; the experiments were repeated one week later with 100 ng TNF alpha. Control animals received intraperitoneal injections of pyrogen-free phosphate buffered saline. Temperatures were measured rectally at baseline and at 10-minute intervals for 90 minutes post-injection using a thermistor probe and temperature gauge. In the majority of the time intervals following injection, the mean temperature changes of young mice were significantly higher than old mice for both 50 ng and 100 ng doses of TNF alpha. Similarly, peak temperature changes from baseline were consistently higher in young animals following injection of TNF alpha. Moreover, the peak temperature changes in young mice after 50 ng TNF alpha injection were significantly higher than those in old mice following a 100 ng injection of TNF alpha. These findings confirm that (a) TNF alpha has a role in the pathogenesis of fever; (b) aging alters significantly the febrile response; and (c) a mechanism of this age-related blunted febrile response may involve TNF alpha.
