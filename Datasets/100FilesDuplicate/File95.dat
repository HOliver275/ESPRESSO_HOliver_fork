Augmentation of reverse arthus reaction by mast cells in mice. Immune complex-induced injury is an important pathogenic factor in antibody-mediated nephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases. In this study we investigated the role mast cells in immune complex-mediated injury in mouse skin. Reverse Arthus reaction was induced in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice and their congenic controls (WBB6F1(-)+/+). Serial skin sections were evaluated for neutrophil infiltration, edema, and hemorrhage. In WBB6F1-W/Wv mice the neutrophil influx was only 40% and edema 60% of that in congenic controls. Hemorrhage was also significantly reduced in the mast cell-deficient mice. After mast cell reconstitution, the magnitude of the reaction in WBB6F1-W/Wv was equivalent to that in WBB6F1(-)+/+ mice. Mast cell release in reverse Arthus reaction was evaluated by measuring fluorescence intensity after avidin-FITC staining of mast cell granules. There was a 70% decrease in fluorescence intensity. The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor A-63162 significantly decreased neutrophil accumulation (40%), edema (60%), and hemorrhage in WBB6F1(-)+/+, but not in mast cell-deficient mice. Mast cell reconstitution of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice restored the effect of A-63162. The results indicate that mast cells and their mediators, including leukotrienes, make an important contribution to reverse Arthus reaction. 
The significance of myoclonic status epilepticus in postanoxic coma. We report 11 adults who exhibited myoclonic status epilepticus (MSE) after cardiac arrest. Based on pathologic, electroencephalographic, and clinical evidence, we conclude that our patients died from the initial anoxic-ischemic insult rather than as a result of MSE. We suggest that the seizures in these nonsurvivors were self-limited events arising from lethal damage to neurons. Thus, in patients with bilaterally synchronous facial myoclonus, bilateral loss of pupillary or oculovestibular reflexes, and suppression and burst-suppression on EEG, it is not warranted to use anesthetic barbiturates to treat MSE. 
Cyst of the ligamentum flavum: report of six cases. Six cases of cyst of the ligamentum flavum with compression of a lumbar nerve root are reported. All patients exhibited recurrent back pain and sciatica. Investigation included computed tomography, myelography, or both. The correct diagnosis was reached before operation in only half the patients. High-resolution computed tomography performed in the four last patients outlined the cystic lesion with its low-density center. Surgical excision was performed in all patients. Microscopic examination showed a dense fibrous cyst arising from the ligamentum flavum. The lumen contained myxoid or necrotic material, but no epithelial lining. Cysts of the ligamentum flavum must be considered in the differential diagnosis of causes of sciatica. A firm radiological diagnosis may, at present, still require myelography combined with high-resolution computed tomography. Differentiation from synovial or ganglion cysts of the spine is discussed. 
Acute lower limb ischemia: failure of anticoagulant treatment to improve one-month results of arterial thromboembolectomy. A prospective randomized multi-center study. The value of short-term anticoagulant treatment in improving the early outcome in patients operated on for acute lower-limb ischemia has been debated and so far unproven. In this prospective randomized multi-center study, 188 such patients were randomized on admission, either to preoperative and postoperative anticoagulant medication (AC group, n = 94) or no anticoagulant treatment during the first month after surgery (O group, n = 94). Background factors were evenly distributed in the two groups, and 89% of the cases were considered as embolic. Analysis on an intention-to-treat basis showed no differences in outcome after 30 days. Good results, survivors who had amputation, and patients who died in the two groups are given respectively: AC group, 61%, 9%, 30%; O group, 65%, 11%, 24%. The results were similar in the two treatment groups also if only patients with a cardiac source of embolism were analyzed. Local bleeding complications were more common in the AC group (17% vs 2%, p less than 0.01). It is concluded that preoperative and early postoperative anticoagulant medication should not be routinely administered since such treatment is unlikely to improve the short-term results of lower-limb arterial thromboembolectomy while bleeding complications increase. The possible value of late (beyond 1 month) long-term anticoagulant treatment remains to be studied. 
Distribution of carbon flux within fatty acid utilization during myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Twenty-nine intact, working pig hearts were extracorporeally perfused and divided into two study groups (16 Aerobic and 13 Ischemic/Reflow hearts). Step function, equilibrium labeling with [14C]palmitate was used to develop uptake and washout curves of radioactive fatty acid products contained in coronary effluent during either aerobic perfusion or reperfusion after ischemia (60% reduction in left anterior descending coronary flow for 30 minutes). Left anterior descending control flows were slightly overperfused in Aerobic hearts (18% higher than in Ischemic/Reflow hearts); otherwise, circumflex and right coronary flows, left ventricular pressure, and serum fatty acids and blood sugar levels were comparable between groups. As expected in Ischemic/Reflow hearts, recovery of regional systolic shortening and myocardial oxygen consumption in reperfusion was only modestly impaired (-20% and -19%, respectively, not significant and p less than 0.011 compared with preischemic values, not significant from Aerobic hearts). The only significant metabolized product to be released from labeled fatty acid utilization in either group was 14CO2. A smaller fatty acid pool also was measured and accounted for by that contained in the coronary intravascular volume. We could determine no significant back diffusion of fatty acids from myocardium in either perfusion condition. Uptake time constants of the early phase of 14CO2 production also were virtually identical in both groups (19.9 +/- 3.2 versus 16.7 +/- 3.2 minutes in Aerobic and Ischemic/Reflow hearts, respectively) and strongly correlated with hemodynamics as described by heart rate. In washout studies, tissue radioactivity in the aqueous soluble and fatty acid pools declined in both study groups, and counts in complex lipids and cholesterol/cholesteryl esters remained steady, whereas those in triacylglycerols varied. Washout of 14CO2 in both groups never reached background radioactivity over a 40-minute sampling after cessation of isotope infusion into the perfusate, suggesting slow release of trapped substrate from intracellular pools, which then proceeded to fatty acid oxidation. In conclusion, these experiments have demonstrated very similar findings with respect to fatty acid uptake, storage, and release characteristics between aerobic and reperfused myocardium. We found no differences in preferred substrate utilization and oxidation as a result of reversible ischemia followed by reflow. 
Improved results with the addition of interferon alfa-2b to dacarbazine in the treatment of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma. Sixty-four patients with histologically confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma were entered on a prospectively controlled randomized trial. Patients received dacarbazine (DTIC) alone or DTIC plus interferon (IFN) alfa-2b. Patients were reasonably balanced with respect to age, sex, performance status (PS), site of metastases, and number of metastatic sites. Objective response (complete plus partial remission [CR + PR]) was documented in six patients on DTIC and in 16 patients on DTIC plus IFN alfa-2b. Median time to treatment failure (TTF) and median survival are significantly better on the combination arm, with some long-term CRs observed. More toxicity was encountered in the combination arm, which was acceptable except in three patients where treatment was discontinued because of IFN toxicity. 
The cognitive and psychological sequelae of uncomplicated aneurysm surgery. Many patients are left with psychological symptoms after surgery for a ruptured intracranial aneurysm. Often the reason for these symptoms is not clear. A prospective study was carried out of 27 patients who were in a good (Grade 1 or 2) condition before operation to identify the origin of such symptoms and discover whether the basic techniques of aneurysm surgery could lead to serious psychological sequelae even in the absence of any specific complication. Each patient was given a modified psychometric assessment just before surgery and at the time of discharge from hospital. One year later a full psychometric and social assessment was carried out. Even a temporary worsening of psychometric performance did not occur unless there had been some specific surgical or post-operative problem. Five patients showed worsening of psychometric performance in the immediate post-operative period but by one year, only two of the 27 patients showed any abnormalities on formal psychometric evaluation; in both, clear reasons were evident. Although the majority of patients reported minor psychological symptoms, these had not hindered full functional recovery, and we doubt whether they had any organic basis. It is concluded that aneurysm surgery does not, itself, threaten higher intellectual function unless some specific complication occurs. 
Unexplained syncope evaluated by electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing. OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical characteristics of subgroups of patients with unexplained syncope having electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing and to assess the efficacy of various therapies. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Inpatient services of a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Eighty-six consecutively referred patients with unexplained syncope. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had electrophysiologic examinations. Patients with negative results subsequently had head-up tilt testing. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine (34%) patients (group 1) had abnormal electrophysiologic results, with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in 72%. Thirty-four (40%) patients (group 2) had syncope provoked by head-up tilt testing. The cause of syncope remained unexplained in 23 (26%) patients (group 3). Structural heart disease was present in 76%, 6%, and 30% of groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In group 1, pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapy was recommended based on electrophysiologic evaluation. All group 2 patients had negative results on head-up tilt testing while receiving oral beta blockers (27 patients) or disopyramide (7 patients). Group 3 patients did not receive any specific therapy. During a median follow-up period of 18.5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of electrophysiologic evaluation and head-up tilt testing can identify the underlying cause of syncope in as many as 74% of patients presenting with unexplained syncope. Therapeutic strategies formulated according to the results of these diagnostic tests appear to prevent syncope effectively in most patients. 
Transantral sphenoethmoidectomy: a procedure for the 1990s? Currently, among otolaryngologists, much attention is focused on the surgical management of paranasal sinus disease. However, transantral sphenoethmoidectomy is rarely mentioned in the literature of the past several decades. We reviewed a consecutive series of 98 patients over a 12-year period who underwent transantral sphenoethmoidectomy in the treatment of severe chronic hyperplastic pansinusitis. The major and minor complications encountered are tabulated, as are the clinical outcomes. A description of the operative technique is followed by a discussion of the indications for this approach. We believe transantral sphenoethmoidectomy has a useful place in modern paranasal sinus surgery. 
Deliberate hypotension with nicardipine or nitroprusside during total hip arthroplasty. To induce deliberate hypotension during anesthesia, nicardipine was administered to patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty and was randomly compared with nitroprusside. Hemodynamic measurements were performed before and 10, 20, 30, and 60 min after starting to administer either nicardipine (n = 12) or nitroprusside (n = 12) (B, T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively); at the end of drug infusion (T5); and 10, 20, and 60 min later (T6, T7, and T8, respectively). Plasma renin activity and catecholamine levels were measured at B, T1, T5, T6, and T7. In addition, plasma nicardipine concentration was measured in five patients at T1, T2, T5, T7, and T8. As with nitroprusside, nicardipine administration (1-3 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, after a titration dose of 4.7 +/- 1.5 mg) resulted in hypotension (up to -34% +/- 3%), a decrease in systemic vascular resistances (up to -49% +/- 4%), and increases in heart rate (up to +17% +/- 6%), cardiac index (up to +37% +/- 8%), plasma norepinephrine (up to +63% +/- 17%) and epinephrine (up to +232% +/- 68%) levels, and plasma renin activity (up to +336% +/- 207%). Ten and 20 minutes after discontinuation of the hypotensive drug, nicardipine led to persistent vasodilation and hypotension, which differed significantly from the hypertensive rebound observed after nitroprusside discontinuation, despite a similar increase in plasma renin activity and catecholamine levels. Our results indicate that after the infusion was terminated, the nicardipine-induced vasodilation was opposed to the vasoconstrictive effects of angiotensin II and catecholamines, thus avoiding hypertensive rebound.

During a median follow-up period of 18.5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of electrophysiologic evaluation and head-up tilt testing can identify the underlying cause of syncope in as many as 74% of patients presenting with unexplained syncope. Therapeutic strategies formulated according to the results of these diagnostic tests appear to prevent syncope effectively in most patients. 
Arrhythmias in heart failure--therapeutic challenges. Electrophysiologic disorders are common at all stages of heart failure due to myocardial mechanical factors, neuroendocrine disturbances, electrolyte abnormalities, or ischemia, and also because of cardiovascular drugs. The prevalence of various forms of heart block, bradycardias, and arrhythmias in heart failure is largely unknown, as is their relationship to the etiology of the syndrome. Complex and multiform ventricular premature beats and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia are common, and their frequency is broadly related to the severity of heart failure. Supraventricular arrhythmias are also common features of the syndrome. The heart failure syndrome has an ominous prognosis. Approximately half the patients die suddenly, but the causal relationship between preexisting arrhythmias and sudden death is not known. Equally vital is knowledge of the influence of drug therapy on the arrhythmias of heart failure, but at present this is scarce and needs further study. 
Headache spectrum in Arnold-Chiari malformation. Exertional headaches in patients with Arnold-Chiari malformation (ACM) are well described. We report four patients with Type I ACM and recurrent headaches. These patients presented, respectively, with low spinal fluid pressure headache, migraine without aura, migraine with aura, and migraine with prolonged aura. This report suggests the need for observing patients with recurrent headaches for any physical stigmata of craniovertebral junction anomalies, and the need to exclude ACM in such patients. Possible implications of the association between ACM and different types of headaches are discussed. 
Vocal cord paralysis in the Shy-Drager syndrome. A cause of postoperative respiratory obstruction. A case is presented in which unexpected and persistent postoperative respiratory problems led to the finding of bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis and confirmed the diagnosis of the Shy-Drager syndrome. Anaesthetists should be aware that vocal cord paralysis may be a feature of this uncommon condition, and should consider the possibility of glottic obstruction as a cause of ventilatory difficulties. 
PTA and laser assisted PTA combined with simultaneous surgical revascularization. In this study we investigated the efficacy of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and laser percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (LPTA) as an adjunct to surgery in patients with peripheral vascular disease. We report 84 cases of the simultaneous association of direct arterial surgery and angioradiological procedures to treat 82 patients with arterial occlusive disease of the lower limbs. Sixty-five patients (79.2%) were affected by severe claudication and 14 (19.6%) presented with rest pain or gangrene. One patient (1.2%) had signs of acute ischemia. PTA or LPTA were utilized as an inflow procedure in 41 cases (48.8%), as an outflow procedure in 24 (28.6%) and in 19 cases (22.6%) to recanalize an arterial occlusion in the contralateral limb opposite to surgical interventions. Immediate postoperative patency was achieved in 79 cases (94.0%), while in 5 cases (6.0%) it was impossible to perform a satisfactory balloon dilatation. The complication rate was 16.6%: 10 perioperative thromboses, 1 plaque dissection, 1 peripheral embolus, 1 haemorrhage and 1 femoral nerve lesion. No perioperative mortality occurred in this group of patients. Long term patency, analyzed with the life-table method (mean follow-up: 28 months) was respectively 78.0%, 76.3% and 78.9% at 5 years. These data indicate that the combined revascularization technique should always be recommended in properly selected patients because it is less invasive, the surgical risk and operative time are reduced and associated with early and long term cumulative patency rates comparable to those of extensive surgery. 
Study of P wave morphology in lead V1 during supraventricular tachycardia for localizing the reentrant circuit. Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a benign form of tachycardia that generally does not require costly evaluation. The purpose of this study was to describe a new sign permitting delineation of the mechanism of SVT by analysis of the P wave in lead V1 and the left atrial electrogram, which may be registered by the esophageal electrode. Among 146 patients with SVT, 72 had a ventriculoatrial interval greater than 70 msec. The P wave in lead V1 during SVT was discernible in 69 of them. The precession of the left atrial electrogram on the P wave in lead V1 was always associated with reentry through a left lateral (n = 37) or posteroseptal (n = 4) accessory atrioventricular (AV) connection. When the P wave in lead V1 preceded or occurred simultaneously with the left atrial electrogram, reentry was through either the AV node or a right-sided accessory AV connection. On the other hand, although the P wave in lead V1 was more frequently negative in reentry through a right-sided connection and positive in reentry through a left-sided connection, the polarity was not specific enough to identify the reentry. The precession of the left atrial electrogram recorded by the esophageal electrode on the P wave in lead V1 during SVT was a specific criterion of reentry through a left accessory AV connection, and this technique could be useful for preliminary localization of the accessory connection before electrophysiologic study. 
Hyperdynamic circulation in a chronic murine schistosomiasis model of portal hypertension. Chronic murine schistosomiasis is a natural disease model of portal hypertension closely mimicking the clinical and histological features of human hepatic schistosomiasis. We studied the splanchnic and systemic hemodynamics in the murine model of schistosomiasis by radioactive microsphere technique. Mice infected with 60 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni (n = 8) were studied hemodynamically 11 wk after the infection and were compared with age-matched healthy controls (n = 11). Mean portal venous inflow in the infected mice (3.82 +/- 0.32 ml/min) was 61% higher than in the healthy animals (2.37 +/- 0.25 ml/min; p less than 0.01). A twofold increase in hepatic arterial flow was also seen in mice with schistosomiasis (0.47 +/- 0.14 ml/min) as compared with controls (0.16 +/- 0.03 ml/min; p less than 0.05), whereas splanchnic arteriolar resistance (60.91 +/- 7.64 vs. 101.21 +/- 11.06 mm Hg.min.ml-1.gm; p less than 0.05) and peripheral vascular resistance (112.05 +/- 14.05 vs 254.53 +/- 29.86 mm Hg.min.ml-1.gm; p less than 0.01) were reduced. There was a significant increase in cardiac index (752 +/- 99 vs. 453 +/- 55 ml.min-1.kg body weight-1; p less than 0.05) and reduction in mean arterial pressure (81.37 +/- 3.09 vs. 101.45 +/- 5.85 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) in the infected animals compared with controls. These observations clearly demonstrate the existence of a hyperdynamic circulatory state in this model of portal hypertension. 
Role of adjuvant therapy in colorectal cancer. After nearly three decades of consistently disappointing adjuvant therapy trials in resectable colorectal cancer, recently emerging results offer some basis for cautious optimism. Adjuvant fluorouracil-containing regimens appear to confer a modest treatment benefit in completely resected colonic adenocarcinomas. The two most promising chemotherapy approaches at present appear to be the fluorouracil-levamisole and fluorouracil-leucovorin regimens. The optimal schedule and dose of these agents remains to be determined. Portal vein chemotherapy infusion studies have yielded promising but inconclusive results to date. As data from completed or ongoing large group studies become available, the role of this modality will be better clarified. In rectal cancer, adjuvant radiotherapy alone has a modest but consistent ability to reduce local recurrence without demonstrating any survival advantage. The optimal dose and sequencing of radiotherapy remains poorly defined. Two completed cooperative group studies strongly suggest that the optimal use of radiotherapy is in combination with chemotherapy. The independent role of chemotherapy in rectal cancer remains unclear. There is suggestive evidence that adjuvant chemotherapy is more effective with rectal cancer than with primaries arising proximal to the peritoneal reflection. Despite the large number of unresolved questions that remain, the following interim treatment recommendations can be made: 1. Patients with Dukes' B and C rectal and colonic adenocarcinomas should be entered into an appropriate adjuvant clinical trial when feasible. 2. Outside the setting of a protocol, there is a sound rationale to treat Dukes' B and C rectal cancer with combination chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy. The chemotherapy could consist of fluorouracil either alone or combined with leucovorin. 3. In more proximal colonic tumors (above the pelvic peritoneal reflection), recently described improvements in survival for patients with Dukes' B disease suggests that adjuvant therapy should be withheld in this group when not participating in a clinical study. Patients with Dukes' C tumors should receive fluorouracil-levamisole. 
Obstructive sleep apnea in children with Down syndrome. Children with Down syndrome have many predisposing factors for the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS), yet the type and severity of OSAS in this population has not been characterized. Fifty-three subjects with Down syndrome (mean age 7.4 +/- 1.2 [SE] years; range 2 weeks to 51 years) were studied. Chest wall movement, heart rate, electroculogram, end-tidal PO2 and PCO2, transcutaneous PO2 and PCO2, and arterial oxygen saturation were measured during a daytime nap polysomnogram. Sixteen of these children also underwent overnight polysomnography. Nap polysomnograms were abnormal in 77% of children; 45% had obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), 4% had central apnea, and 6% had mixed apneas; 66% had hypoventilation (end-tidal PCO2 greater than 45 mm Hg) and 32% desaturation (arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%). Overnight studies were abnormal in 100% of children, with OSA in 63%, hypoventilation in 81%, and desaturation in 56%. Nap studies significantly underestimated the presence of abnormalities when compared to overnight polysomnograms. Seventeen (32%) of the children were referred for testing because OSAS was clinically suspected, but there was no clinical suspicion of OSAS in 36 (68%) children. Neither age, obesity, nor the presence of congenital heart disease affected the incidence of OSA, desaturation, or hypoventilation. Polysomnograms improved in all 8 children who underwent tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, but they normalized in only 3. It is concluded that children with Down syndrome frequently in have OSAS, with OSA, hypoxemia, and hypoventilation. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is seen frequently in those children in whom it is not clinically suspected. It is speculated that OSAS may contribute to the unexplained pulmonary hypertension seen in children with Down syndrome. 
Blood transfusion and recurrent Crohn's disease. The effect of blood transfusion on the postoperative recurrence of Crohn's disease has been investigated. Clinical and pathological data from 197 patients treated by right hemicolectomy between 1947 and 1988 have been analysed. Symptomatic recurrences confirmed radiologically or histologically have been recorded and cumulative recurrence rates calculated for transfused and non-transfused patients. Perioperative blood transfusion does not influence the development of recurrent disease (log rank test, chi 2 = 0.112). 
Tuberous sclerosis with primary meningioma of the maxillary antrum. Primary extracranial meningiomas are uncommon; they have been documented in the ear, skin, orbit, parapharyngeal space, parotid gland, mediastinum, and rarely the paranasal sinuses. Tuberous sclerosis is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome characterized by multiple connective tissue tumours. We report the first case of a tuberous sclerosis patient with a maxillary antral meningioma. 
Pregnancy-induced hypertension and low birth weight: the role of calcium. Considerable interest has developed regarding the role of calcium in the regulation of blood pressure. Epidemiologic investigations, laboratory evaluations, and clinical trials all confirm that the relationship between calcium and blood pressure extends to include the pregnant state. On the basis of current information it is clear that calcium supplementation during pregnancy lowers blood pressure. Additionally, the effect of calcium on blood pressure may influence the incidence and/or gestational age of development of preeclampsia. Additionally, the effect on smooth-muscle relaxation detected in calcium-supplemented patients may affect the incidence of prematurity. Although the mechanism for these effects has not been entirely elucidated, calcium supplementation appears to affect circulating concentrations of parathyroid hormone and renin, which may modulate intracellular ionized calcium, resulting in the observed effect on smooth-muscle relaxation. This effect may also be responsible for reduced uterine activity and for a lowering of the incidence of prematurity. 
Active idiopathic ulcerative colitis in a patient with ongoing HIV-related immunodepression. It is suspected that immune mechanisms are important in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. The following is a case report of a patient with human immunodeficiency virus-related immunodeficiency whose ulcerative colitis ran a course independent of the depression of his peripheral CD4 cells. Thus, peripheral CD4 cells may have little role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis. 
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Lack of association between clinical improvement and effects on sleep. Thirteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis (mean +/- SD age 55.8 +/- 10.5 years) received 20 mg of tenoxicam daily for 90 days following a 3-7 day "washout" period and 4 days of placebo treatment. Clinical evaluations were conducted at the end of the washout period and at monthly intervals thereafter. All-night polysomnography was performed in a sleep laboratory during the last 2 days of placebo treatment and on days 13, 14, 89, and 90 of tenoxicam treatment. Although there was improvement in the patients' clinical condition, there were no treatment-related changes in any of the sleep parameters. Eight of the 13 patients, however, were found to have primary sleep disorders. Four had periodic leg movements during sleep, 3 had sleep apneas, and 1 had a combination of both disorders. The implications of these findings in the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are discussed. 
Induced hypertension during restoration of flow after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat: effect on neuronal injury and edema. The effect of hypertension instituted during restoration of flow after focal ischemia was studied. After the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of 12 rats was occluded for 2 hours, the ligatures were released and flow was restored for a period of 2 hours. In the control group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group, the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg immediately after reestablishment of MCA patency. The area of neuronal injury, determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining, was significantly smaller in the hypertensive group. Specific gravity, determined by microgravimetry, did not differ between groups. The data demonstrate that modest hypertension, when induced during reperfusion after 2 hours of MCA occlusion, reduces neuronal injury and does not exacerbate edema formation. 
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of gall stones: an in vitro comparison between an electrohydraulic and a piezoceramic device. A comparative study of the effectiveness of two types of lithotripter in fragmenting gall bladder stones is reported. The machines used were a Piezolith 2300, which generates shock waves by the piezoceramic principle, and a Dornier MPL 9000, which produces the shock waves by underwater spark discharge. With each machine, corresponding stones of 45 pairs of weight and volume matched calculi (median volume 0.5 cm3, median diameter 10.5 mm) obtained at cholecystectomy were treated. All stones were successfully disintegrated (fragments smaller than 2 mm) with up to 5400 (median 628) shocks with the Piezolith and 3450 (median 428) shocks with the MPL 9000 lithotripters. With the Piezolith, operating at the highest power setting, a 1.65 fold median higher number of shocks was required for stone fragmentation than with the MPL 9000 at a medium power setting. Stone volume seemed to be the only determinant which affected ease of fragmentation; composition and density of the stones as assessed by computed tomography did not seem to be governing factors. 
Combined split anterior tibial-tendon transfer and intramuscular lengthening of the posterior tibial tendon. Results in patients who have a varus deformity of the foot due to spastic cerebral palsy. Twenty patients who had a varus deformity of the foot secondary to spastic cerebral palsy had twenty-two operations involving combined split anterior tibial-tendon transfer and intramuscular lengthening of the posterior tibial tendon, with and without concomitant lengthening of the Achilles tendon. Preoperatively, all patients had had a dynamic varus deformity of the hindfoot and adduction of the forefoot in both the stance phase and the swing phase of gait. At an average follow-up of 6.2 years (range, 2.3 to 8.8 years), there were fourteen excellent, four good, and four poor clinical results. Two patients who had a fixed varus deformity of the hindfoot and one patient who had a very weak anterior tibial muscle had a poor result. We concluded that the combined procedure is effective for correction of a flexible varus deformity of the foot in patients who have spastic cerebral palsy. 
Positive regulation of human thyrotropin receptor mRNA by thyrotropin. We have assessed the influence of natural and recombinant thyrotropin (TSH) on mRNA specific for the human TSH receptor (TSHR) in normal and abnormal adult human thyroid monolayer cells. Using physiological concentrations of TSH (less than 100 mU/L), a marked increase in the level of TSHR mRNA was observed within 12 hours and reached a greater than 1000% increase after 24 hours exposure. At high TSH concentrations (greater than 1000 mU/L), this increase in TSHR-specific mRNA was markedly reduced. However, at no time were basal TSHR mRNA levels suppressed even with 100 U/L of TSH for 48 hours. These observations demonstrate ligand-induced up-regulation of the human TSHR mRNA by physiologically relevant concentrations of TSH. 
Spinal and supraspinal correlates of nociception in man. The objective of this work was to simultaneously measure pain-related spinal and supraspinal physiological responses in humans. The sural nerve compound action potential (CAP), the spinal withdrawal reflex (RIII), the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and subjective magnitude ratings were elicited by electrical stimulation of the sural nerve in 10 healthy subjects. The sural nerve CAP was used to normalize the evoking stimulus current and to help identify the peripheral nerve afferent types contributing to the physiological and psychophysical responses. Normalizing stimulus current to a proportion of that which elicited a just maximal sural nerve CAP significantly reduced individual variability in magnitude ratings, the RIII and the SEP. Pain and RIII responses only occurred at stimulus levels that were greater than or equal to 1.5 x that which produced a just maximal sural nerve CAP and both responses were positively related to stimulus intensity above that level. Activity in the large diameter A beta fibers will be saturated at stimulus levels near that which produced a just maximal CAP, which implies that both the pain and RIII responses can be attributed to recruitment of the smaller diameter A delta fibers. Although the amplitudes of the P200 and P300 peaks of the SEP were significantly related to stimulation at noxious levels, both were also affected by stimulation at innocuous levels. This result implies that these peaks receive contributions from both noxious and innocuous somatosensory processes. Clearly, the non-pain-related components of these SEP peaks must be identified and isolated before their potential in measuring supraspinal nociceptive processes can be fully realized. 
Microscopic hematuria: advances in identification of glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes. The high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of microscopically visible, typically glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes for identification of the cause of glomerular bleeding have been recognized worldwide. Although glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes are simple to detect on phase contrast microscopy, immediate microscopic diagnosis still is indispensable, since a change in the morphology of the erythrocytes with restriction of the diagnostic relevance is anticipated because of the high autolytic potency of the urine. It may be postulated that this need for immediate diagnosis has led to the method being neglected owing to the high work load at hospitals and physician offices. Moreover, a physician who does not perform microscopic investigations or who lacks experience with the method will not be able to use this diagnostic technique, since it appeared to be impossible to transport urine samples by mail. In the context of a study comprising 30 patients, of whom 10 had histologically confirmed glomerulonephritis, we have shown that glomerular dysmorphic erythrocytes have a manifest form stability for at least 3 days. The preservative used was thimerosal. Also, the urine can be investigated independent of time even after alcoholic Papanicolaou staining without an alteration of erythrocyte morphology. The practicality of the form stability of glomerular erythrocytes can be exploited in everyday medical routine. There are well founded prospects that the rate of early diagnosis of glomerulonephritis will increase. 
Fasting gastric pH and its relationship to true hypochlorhydria in humans. Abnormally low rates of gastric acid secretion (hypochlorhydria) are associated with bacterial overgrowth, enteric infection, and with hypergastrinemia and an increased risk of gastric neoplasms. In the present study, we evaluated the ability of fasting gastric juice pH measurements to detect true hypochlorhydria. True hypochlorhydria was defined as a peak acid output in response to a maximally effective stimulant of acid secretion that was below the lower limit of normal for 365 consecutive healthy subjects. In these healthy subjects, average basal pH was 2.16 +/- 0.09 in men and 2.79 +/- 0.18 in women. In 109 consecutive experiments in 28 subjects with true hypochlorhydria, fasting gastric pH averaged 7.44 +/- 0.11 in men and 7.65 +/- 0.33 in women. Fasting pH exceeded the upper 95% confidence limit of normal (5.09 in men and 6.81 in women) in 102 of the 109 experiments (94%). Thus, fasting pH measurement was a sensitive method for diagnosing bona fide hypochlorhydria. 
Congenital anomalies in children of patients who received chemotherapy for cancer in childhood and adolescence. BACKGROUND. Many patients who have been treated successfully for childhood cancer with regimens that contain one or more mutagenic chemotherapeutic agents are concerned that their own treatment during childhood or adolescence may adversely affect their children. METHODS. To determine the effect of chemotherapy for cancer during childhood and adolescence on the outcome of subsequent pregnancies, we reviewed the records of 306 men and women who had been treated for pediatric cancer and who responded to our questionnaire. One hundred of the 306 patients reported 202 pregnancies. Among the patients who had received chemotherapy as part of their treatment for cancer, 60 patients or wives of patients had had one or more pregnancies of 20 or more weeks' gestation. The 60 former patients had a total of 100 live-born and 2 stillborn children. RESULTS. The frequency of congenital anomalies was 8.1 percent (5 of 62) among the live-born children of the women and 7.9 percent (3 of 38) among the live-born children of the men. Structural congenital cardiac defects were identified in 10.0 percent (2 of 20) of the children of women who had been treated with dactinomycin, as compared with 0.6 percent (144 of 24,153) among the children in a multicenter survey of fetal anomalies (P = 0.0126). We found no relation between the number of mutagens received or the cumulative dose of any agent received and the frequency of congenital anomalies in the children. CONCLUSIONS. These data suggest that treatment of children and adolescents with mutagenic chemotherapeutic agents, in the dose ranges we examined, does not increase the frequency of congenital anomalies in the children subsequently born to the former patients. However, the possible adverse effect of dactinomycin on the children of such patients requires further study. 
Repetitive sinoatrial exit block as the major mechanism of drug-provoked long sinus or atrial pause. Prolonged sinus or atrial pause occurred in six patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia after drug administration. All six patients had normal sinus node function during control electrophysiologic study; the sinus cycle length ranged from 510 to 900 ms (mean 743 +/- 141) and the longest sinus node recovery time ranged from 800 to 1,230 ms (mean 1,018 +/- 168). A long sinus or atrial pause occurring at the termination of tachycardia or cessation of atrial pacing, ranging from 3,100 to 8,200 ms (mean 6,270 +/- 1,674), was provoked by the administration of various drugs. These included an intravenous bolus injection of adenosine triphosphate (5 mg; one patient), intravenous bolus injection of verapamil (5 mg; one patient), a combination of a single oral dose of diltiazem (120 mg) and propranolol (20 to 40 mg; three patients), oral diltiazem (240 mg/day; one patient) and a combination of oral diltiazem (240 mg/day) and propranolol (160 mg/day; one patient). In five patients, low frequency deflections suggestive of sinus node activity with a cycle length between 620 and 3,500 ms were recorded during pauses. These findings suggest that repetitive sinoatrial exit block was responsible for the pause. Sinus slowing with a long arrest suggesting suppression of sinus automaticity was also noted in three of these five patients; the longest sinus arrest in these three patients was 4,160, 4,800 and greater than 4,910 ms, respectively. The remaining patient with a pause of 6,840 ms had no recordable sinus activity, either reflecting suppression of sinus automaticity or technical failure. 
Ultrasonographic findings in thalamus and basal ganglia in term asphyxiated infants. Three severely asphyxiated term neonates demonstrated bilateral hyperechogenicity in the thalamus and basal ganglia. During evolution, areas of attenuated echogenicity appeared in these structures at the same time as periventricular cysts were evident in 2 patients with coexistent periventricular leukomalacia. All 3 patients developed ventricular dilatation; in the 2 patients with periventricular leukomalacia, the ventricular border was irregular in the outer (dorsal) margin, and interhemispheric fissures were widened as a manifestation of cerebral atrophy. Furthermore, the thalamic inner (ventral) margins of the lateral ventricles were irregular in all 3 patients. This previously unrecognized finding points to a particular form of cerebral atrophy localized in the gangliothalamic region that contributes to the development of ventriculomegaly. The reported sonographic sequence implies profound damage in the thalamus and basal ganglia in asphyxiated infants which undoubtedly has contributed to the poor outcomes of our patients. 
Laboratory correlates and prognostic significance of granular acute lymphoblastic leukemia in children. A Pediatric Oncology Group study. As part of a comprehensive prospective clinicopathologic study by the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG), 2,092 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were evaluated by uniform morphologic, cytochemical, and immunologic methods to assess the frequency and implications of granular lymphoblasts. All cases were Sudan black or myeloperoxidase negative and met French-American-British (FAB) morphologic criteria for ALL. Granular ALL, characterized by the presence of more than 5% marrow blasts with at least three clearly defined azurophilic cytoplasmic granules, was identified in 56 of the 1,252 fully studied cases (4.5%). The frequency of granular features did not differ among early pre-B (4.3%), pre-B (3.6%), and T (5.8%) ALL; no cases were identified among the 12 patients with B ALL. Within the early pre-B/pre-B group, granular ALL was equally distributed between good- and poor-risk clinical groups but was more frequent among FAB L2 than FAB L1 cases (12% vs. 2%; P less than or equal to 0.001). Patients were treated with standard POG protocols for early pre-B/pre-B and T ALL. Complete remission (CR) rates were significantly lower for those with granular lymphoblasts, regardless of risk group, immunophenotype, or FAB type. Analysis of event-free survival (EFS) showed a significantly poorer outcome for granular early pre-B/pre-B cases with FAB L2 morphologic characteristics (P less than 0.001) and for those classified as poor risk (P = 0.015). These findings suggest a relationship between granules and L2 morphologic characteristics in childhood ALL and indicate that the presence of granular lymphoblasts conveys a worse prognosis for certain subgroups of children with ALL. 
Lymphomas of true histiocytic origin. Expression of different phenotypes in so-called true histiocytic lymphoma and malignant histiocytosis. The authors determined the phenotypes of neoplastic cells in true histiocytic lymphoma and malignant histiocytosis by using a large panel of monoclonal antibodies and enzyme histochemistry procedures. Although the phenotypes overlapped slightly, the authors noted a distinct pattern in these tumors. The tumor cells of malignant histiocytosis generally expressed the monocyte markers CD11b, CD11c, CD14, and CD45, especially after induction with phorbol ester. In contrast, the tumor cells of true histiocytic lymphoma exhibited a marker expression very similar to that of Reed-Sternberg cells in Hodgkin's disease. These cells expressed markers CD30, 2H9, and 1A2, but rarely expressed CD11b, CD11c, CD14, or CD45. Regardless of their cytologic features, the tumor cells from both types of histiocytic lymphoma exhibited diffuse nonspecific esterase and acid phosphatase activities, and they expressed histiocyte markers CD15, CD68, LN5, 1E9, and M387 to varying degrees. The tumor cells from both lymphomas did not exhibit T- or B-cell markers, T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, or gene translation products, even when they were induced with phorbol ester. The phenotypic expression in these two histiocytic malignancies suggests that they are derived from different types of histiocytes, or from histiocytes in different stages of maturation or differentiation, or from histiocytes that have distinct mechanisms of tumorigenic transformation. The expression of circulating monocyte markers in malignant histiocytosis suggests that this tumor originates in monocytes or free histiocytes, whereas the phenotype of true histiocytic lymphoma is compatible with an origin in fixed histiocytes, which generally are devoid of the monocyte markers CD11b and CD14. 
Hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis: report of two cases and review of the literature. The cases of two patients with idiopathic pachymeningitis hypertrophica that caused progressive paraparesis are presented. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to demonstrate this pathological entity in one patient, and myelography was used in the other. Decompressive surgery led to significant neurological improvement. The etiology, diagnosis, and management of this disease is discussed, and the literature is reviewed. To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the features of this rare pathological entity on magnetic resonance imaging. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of vertebrobasilar ectasia in tic convulsif. Case report. A patient with trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm was evaluated using multiplanar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadolinium enhancement. Preoperative images demonstrated massively ectatic vertebral and basilar arteries and their distortion of the brain stem and the trigeminal and facial nerves. Surgical manipulation included selective trigeminal rhizotomy, cushioning of the residual nerve at the point of maximal distortion by the underlying basilar artery, and microvascular decompression of the seventh nerve from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery which was being pushed dorsomedially by the vertebral artery. Postoperatively, the patient had neither trigeminal neuralgia nor facial spasm. Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging not only excludes other etiologies such as tumor or arteriovenous malformation, but also demonstrates cranial nerve compression by ectatic vertebral and basilar arteries. The choice of preoperative imaging modality is discussed and the literature concerning the etiology of tic convulsif is reviewed. 
Prevention of restenosis by lovastatin after successful coronary angioplasty. Prevention of restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) remains a major challenge. To determine whether lovastatin could prevent restenosis, between December 1987 and July 1988, a total of 157 patients undergoing successful PTCA were randomly and prospectively assigned to the lovastatin group or a control group. Seventy-nine patients received lovastatin (20 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was less than 300 mg/dl and 40 mg daily if the serum cholesterol level was greater than or equal to 300 mg/dl) in addition to conventional therapy (lovastatin group). Seventy-eight patients received conventional therapy alone (control group). Fifty patients in the lovastatin group and 29 in the control group were evaluated with coronary angiography at an interval of 2 to 10 months (mean 4 months). The restenosis rate was evaluated according to the number of patients showing restenosis, the number of vessels restenosed, and the number of PTCA sites restenosed. Restenosis was defined as the presence of greater than 50% stenosis of the PTCA site. In the lovastatin group 6 of 50 patients (12%) had restenosis compared with 13 of 29 patients (44.4%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). When the number of vessels restenosed was considered, only 9 of 72 vessels (12.5%) restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 13 of 34 vessels (38.2%) in the control group (p less than 0.002). Similarly, 10 of 80 (12.5%) PTCA sites restenosed in the lovastatin group compared with 15 of 36 (41.7%) in the control group (p less than 0.001). 
Headaches due to spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection magnetic resonance imaging evaluation and follow up. Spontaneous internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection is not an infrequent cause of headache and acute neurologic deficits in the younger population. Angiography has been the imaging modality of choice for both diagnosis and follow-up. The use of magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), in conjunction with angiography, is described in three patients shown to have ICA dissection. Our clinical findings suggest that MRI may provide a less expensive, non-invasive, diagnostic and particularly a follow up modality in patients with headache and signs suggestive of ICA dissection. 
Prognostic factors in colorectal carcinoma treated by preoperative radiotherapy and immediate surgery. The clinicopathologic staging of colorectal cancer is the subject of recent debate. We studied morphologic variables in a series of tumors resected from 284 patients. Half had been prospectively, randomly allocated to receive a 4-day schedule of preoperative pelvic radiotherapy followed by immediate surgery. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) difference in the distribution of tumors of various histopathologic grades between irradiated (XS) and unirradiated (S) patients and borderline differences in the predictive values of venous spread, tumor grading, and local spread. However, these differences were less marked in 180 tumors examined by one review pathologist. They were thought to be due to misinterpretation of changes induced by radiotherapy. No differences were detected in the distribution of tumors of various sizes and Dukes' stage in the XS and S groups. The review pathologist recorded a borderline (P = 0.049) difference in the distribution of tumors of various CEA staining patterns between the XS and S groups. In a Cox regression model. Dukes' staging remained the most important predictive variable for survival and pelvic recurrence in the XS and S groups. Dukes' staging was apparently unchanged by this schedule of preoperative radiotherapy, but Broders' grading may be unreliable. Any new clinicopathologic staging system for colorectal cancer should record when preoperative radiotherapy is delivered. More studies of radiotherapy effects are required. 
Chlamydia trachomatis in the etiology of acute otitis media. In an effort to show that Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) may be involved in the causation of acute otitis media (AOM), we performed three experiments. In the first, we inoculated the tympanic bullae of 6 chinchillas with CT. Five of the 6 inoculated animals developed CT AOM. In the second experiment, we sprayed the nasopharynx of 10 chinchillas with CT. Of these, 8 developed both pharyngitis and AOM, and in 6, live CT was cultured from the middle ear and pharynx. In the third experiment, 5 chinchillas had their conjunctiva inoculated with CT. Three developed CT conjunctivitis. Of these, 2 developed CT pharyngitis and 1 developed CT AOM. We concluded that CT will cause AOM in the chinchilla by direct inoculation into the middle ear as well as indirectly by infection of the nasopharynx and conjunctiva. 
Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator followed by heparin compared with heparin alone for refractory unstable angina pectoris. Patients with unstable angina pectoris who remain symptomatic despite medical treatment are at high risk of death and myocardial infarction. The incidence of refractory unstable angina was examined in a consecutive series of 103 patients who received conventional medical treatment with nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists and aspirin. During 48 hours of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring, 24 patients had greater than or equal to 1 anginal attack, 5 of whom had both painful and painless ischemic episodes. In these 24 patients with unstable angina refractory to conventional medical treatment, the short-term efficacy of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) followed by heparin was assessed and compared with heparin alone in a randomized double-blind trial. Recurrences of ischemic attacks during a 72-hour follow-up period were documented in 9 of the 12 patients given heparin alone. All patients experienced at least 1 symptomatic ischemic episode and 1 patient had both painful and painless ischemia. No patient given rt-PA plus heparin had either symptomatic or asymptomatic ischemic attacks during follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves analysis demonstrated a significantly higher probability of being ischemia free in the group of patients treated with rt-PA followed by heparin than in the group treated with heparin alone (p less than 0.01). Quantitative coronary arteriography failed to reveal any significant changes of ischemia-related lesions before and after each treatment. This study demonstrates that the combination of rt-PA and heparin has a greater protective effect than heparin alone in treating recurrent ischemic episodes in patients with refractory unstable angina. 
Is melanoma changing? Nine hundred ninety-five cases of melanoma of the head and neck were divided into two groups so that certain comparisons could be made concerning the behavior of melanoma over a 55-year period. One hundred twelve melanomas of the ocular system were excluded from this review. The first group consisted of 660 melanomas seen during a period from 1932 to 1972. The second group consisted of 223 melanomas seen during a period from 1973 to 1987. Thirteen parameters, including sex, age, distribution, pre-existing mole, amelanotic melanoma, delay in diagnosis, classification, levels, local recurrence, regional metastasis, systemic metastasis, morbidity, and survival, were studied to assess the behavior and the variations. There is no question that the most important aspect of the favorable changes that have occurred are because of earlier diagnosis and better management by a larger group of well-trained specialists. There are some subtler changes that could possibly indicate biologic alterations, but this requires more time and study to substantiate. 
A controlled study of disruptive vocalizations among geriatric residents in nursing homes. This paper reports the results of a controlled study comparing geriatric residents in nursing homes who displayed disruptive vocalizations with residents in a comparison group. Two 350-bed nursing homes were surveyed, and it was found that 11% of the residents engaged in disruptive vocalizations, at least once per week, of sufficient severity to require consideration in the resident's care plan. Results show that disruptive vocalizers were more functionally impaired and were more likely to receive a diagnosis of dementia. They were also more likely to display a higher activity level and to experience sleep disturbance and to be prescribed neuroleptic medications. Descriptive data are presented on typology of disruptive vocalizations, likely situations for their occurrence, and the utilization and perceived efficacy of common interventions. Suggestions are made regarding behavioral treatments for this vexing problem. 
Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia and physical and cognitive performance at 17 years of age. To estimate the effect of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia on long-term cognitive ability in full-term newborns with a negative Coombs test, we performed a 17-year historical prospective study of 1948 subjects. Intelligence tests and medical examinations performed at the military draft board were stratified according to serum bilirubin concentration. A logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for the confounding effects of gestational age, birth weight, Apgar score, ethnic origin, socioeconomic class, paternal education, birth order, and the administration of phototherapy and exchange transfusion. No direct linear association was shown between neonatal bilirubin levels and intelligence test scores or school achievement at 17 years of age. However, the risk for low intelligence test scores (IQ score less than 85) was found to be significantly higher (P = .014) among full-term male subjects with serum bilirubin levels above 342 mumol/L (20 mg/dL) (odds ratio, 2.96; 95% confidence interval, 1.29-6.79). This association was not observed among female subjects. We conclude that severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, among full-term male newborns with a negative Coombs test, could be associated with lower IQ scores at 17 years of age. 
Evolution of the treatment of the injured colon in the 1980s. During the past 10 years, 1006 patients with colon injuries were treated in an urban trauma center. Primary repair, including suture repair and resection with anastomosis, was performed in 614 patients (61%), colostomy in 284 patients (28%), and exteriorized repairs in 83 patients (8.3%). In the remaining 25 patients (2.5%) who were exsanguinating, the colon injuries were ligated. Independent risk factors for adverse outcomes (defined as a fecal fistula, abdominal abscess, stomal complication, or death from multisystem failure) were identified using multiple logistic regression analysis. These factors were used to match patients at similar risk within different treatment groups, and odds ratios for each treatment were calculated. The odds ratios for primary repair, colostomy, and exteriorized repair were 1.0, 1.9, and 2.0, respectively. Therefore, the chance of an adverse outcome was twice as great for both exteriorized repair or colostomy as for primary repair. It is concluded that further increases in the use of primary repair are warranted. 
Hamartomas of the breast. The clinical and pathologic findings of 17 hamartomas of the breast were studied. All neoplasms were evident as clinically and mammographically discrete masses. The pathologic findings were varied and included circumscribed fibrocystic disease, adenolipoma, fibroadenoma with fat and fibroadenoma with lobules. The heterologous elements identified were cartilage and smooth muscle. All lesions were treated by simple excision. In this study, four different microscopic patterns of hamartoma are described and the necessity for a close clinicopathologic correlation is pointed out in the diagnosis of this lesion. 
PET studies of fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in patients with recurrent colorectal tumors receiving radiotherapy. Forty-four patients with recurrent colorectal carcinoma were examined prior to a combination of conventional photon radiotherapy (40 Gy) and neutron therapy (10 Gy). Twenty-one of these underwent a PET examination after photon therapy and 12 also were studied after the end of combined therapy. CEA plasma levels were measured from blood samples taken immediately before the PET study. A significant decrease in FDG uptake despite good palliative results were observed in only 50% of the patients. This may be explained by inflammatory reactions caused by radiation injury. Inflammation and metabolically active residual tumor tissue cannot be distinguished. It is concluded that an observation interval longer than 6 mo may more effectively detect residual tumor activity. In 14 of 41 examinations, an increased FDG uptake was associated with a normal CEA value, and in only two cases were normal FDG uptake values and increased CEA levels found, suggesting that PET is more sensitive than the measurements of CEA plasma levels for tumor recurrence. 
Surgical management of extracranial vertebral artery occlusive disease. Thirty-seven consecutive patients underwent vertebral artery (VA) reconstruction over a 6 years period (1983-1989). Detailed neurologic, medical, and angiographic information was obtained for all patients. Indications for surgery were as follows: (1) stenosis of VA with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency; (2) very tight stenosis (greater than 75%) of the dominant VA with stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral VA; (3) very tight stenosis of VA with bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA); (4) very tight stenosis of VA with homolateral ICA lesion eligible for simultaneous repair; (5) very tight stenosis of VA and very tight stenosis of the homo or contralateral carotid siphon. There were 15 isolated vertebral lesions (group I), and 22 were VA lesions associated with lesions of the supraaortic trunks which were simultaneously treated (group II). The reconstructions of the first portion of the VA were 30 (12 of group I and 18 of group II) and reimplantation of the VA into the common carotid artery was the procedure of choice. There were 7 revascularizations of the third portion of the VA at C1-C2 level (3 of group I and 4 of group II): carotid-vertebral bypass, using an autogenous vein graft, was the procedure of choice. Three patients in group II died in the immediate postoperative period from myocardial infarction but no patient presented immediate postoperative neurologic deficits. All symptomatic patients but one were relieved of their symptoms in a median follow-up of 31 months. No postoperative complications were observed. Long-term results were satisfactory in all the 28 patients at their last follow-up visit. 
The role of supplemental lag-screw fixation for open fractures of the tibial shaft treated with external fixation. Ninety-nine open fractures of the tibial shaft were treated with unilateral external fixation with or without supplemental lag-screw fixation. We compared the results in forty-four fractures in which only external fixation was used (control group) with those in fifty-five fractures that were stabilized with lag-screws and external fixation, and we found no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to the time to full weight-bearing, the time to union, or the rates of delayed union, osteomyelitis, malunion, superficial or deep pin-track infection, or loosening of the pins. The limbs in which the fracture was treated with external fixation and supplemental lag-screws had more than twice the rate of refracture of the control limbs (11 compared with 5 per cent), and the percentage of fractures having supplemental lag-screw fixation that needed bone-grafting to achieve union was more than twice that in the group treated with external fixation alone. We concluded that the routine use of supplemental lag-screw fixation is not indicated in patients who have an open fracture of the tibial shaft that has been stabilized with external fixation. 
Carcinosarcoma of bladder following long-term cyclophosphamide therapy. Since the advent of long-term cyclophosphamide therapy, an association between this agent and the subsequent development of bladder neoplasms has been documented. Only six sarcomas have been reported, to our knowledge. This report describes the first case in which a leiomyosarcoma and an invasive transitional cell carcinoma (ie, carcinosarcoma) developed in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with 240 g of cyclophosphamide over a 6.5-year period. 
Granulomatous angiitis of the spinal cord associated with Hodgkin's disease. A 28-year-old man had a 5-month history of focal and generalized neurologic symptoms culminating in a thoracic myelopathy. Evaluation revealed granulomatous angiitis of the spinal cord in association with occult nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. In previous reports, manifestations indicative of intracranial involvement have dominated the clinical presentation of granulomatous angiitis associated with Hodgkin's disease. Successful therapy for Hodgkin's disease may result in marked improvement of associated granulomatous angiitis, whereas the lack or failure of therapy results in a uniformly fatal outcome. Definitive antemortem diagnosis of granulomatous angiitis requires a biopsy of involved tissue. The cause of granulomatous angiitis, as well as the nature of its association with Hodgkin's disease, remains unexplained. 
Soft-tissue tumors of the foot: value of MR imaging for specific diagnosis. We reviewed MR imaging findings in 14 patients with primary soft-tissue tumors of the foot and compared them with surgical and pathologic findings to determine the value of MR imaging in anatomic localization, delineation, and characterization of such lesions. Nine tumors (64%) were benign, and five (36%) were malignant. The anatomic location (compartment, space, relation to specific tendon) and extent of all tumors were accurately shown by MR imaging. Twelve tumors (86%) were correctly characterized as benign or malignant. Eight (89%) of nine benign lesions showed distinctive MR imaging features that correctly suggested a specific diagnosis. These included hemangioma (high T2-weighted intensity and internal septa), ganglion cyst (homogeneous, high T2-weighted weighted intensity and peritendinous location), plantar fibromatosis (nodularity of plantar aponeurosis with low intensity on all sequences), and pigmented villonodular synovitis (low T2-weighted intensity and lower intensity rim). Aggressive fibromatosis (one case) could not be characterized. Four (80%) of five malignant neoplasms had MR imaging findings suggesting soft-tissue sarcoma. Two synovial sarcomas were inhomogeneous and showed extensive peritendinous growth. Two clear cell sarcomas arose at the origin of the plantar aponeurosis and infiltrated adjacent muscle. A small clear cell sarcoma could not be characterized as benign or malignant. MR imaging of the foot is accurate in showing the extent of soft-tissue tumors, which is helpful for surgical planning. Determination of their specific anatomic location may help characterize some tumors. Although our series is small, it appears that MR imaging often suggests a specific diagnosis in certain benign soft-tissue tumors of the foot and may often correctly distinguish benign from malignant tumors. 
Focal hepatic lesions: differentiation with MR imaging at 0.5 T. Magnetic resonance (MR) examinations of 43 patients with 95 focal hepatic lesions (diameter, greater than 1 cm) were analyzed for lesion shape, homogeneity, and relative signal intensity compared with normal liver parenchyma, spleen, and skeletal muscle. On T1-weighted, balanced, and T2-weighted images, most metastases (74%), cavernous hemangiomas (76%), and cysts (82%) were smooth and round or oval, while the hepatocellular carcinomas all had irregular borders (40%) or were lobulated (60%). All lesions with irregular borders were malignant. Seventy percent of metastatic lesions, 85% of cavernous hemangiomas, and 100% of simple hepatic cysts were of homogeneous signal intensity, while 60% of hepatocellular carcinomas were inhomogeneous. Logistic regression analysis of multiple lesion characteristics showed that inhomogeneous lesions had a high likelihood of malignancy, while markedly hyperintense lesions had a very low probability of being malignant, regardless of other traits. Homogeneous lesions that were isointense or hyperintense compared with spleen on balanced images but were not markedly hyperintense on T2-weighted images also had a high likelihood of malignancy. 
Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in Raynaud's phenomenon. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) has been described as resulting in vasodilatation. The effect of 2 Hz TENS of the right hand during forty-five minutes on skin temperature and plethysmography of the third digit of both hands and feet and on transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcpO2) of the right hand was compared with that of a control study using indifferent stimulation of the iliopsoas region in 8 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. After TENS a slight increase in skin temperature of both hands was found, while plethysmographic amplitude was increased in the contralateral hand only. No changes in TcpO2 occurred. The authors conclude that the observed small effects of TENS are of no clinical value in primary Raynaud's phenomenon. 
Coronary vasoconstriction induced by vasopressin. Production of myocardial ischemia in dogs by constriction of nondiseased small vessels. BACKGROUND. We studied the effect of intracoronary administration of arginine-8-vasopressin on blood flow in nondiseased coronary arteries and determined whether this vasoconstriction was severe enough to produce ischemia in 30 dogs. METHODS AND RESULTS. In group 1 (n = 6), after vasopressin administration coronary blood flow was decreased by 41% (p less than 0.002) without changes in heart rate or aortic pressure, and left ventricular ejection fraction measured by radionuclide angiocardiography was decreased by 18% (p less than 0.0005). In group 2 (n = 6), ischemia was confirmed by measurement of transmural pH changes. Administration of vasopressin decreased subendocardial pH of the infused zone from 7.40 +/- 0.03 to 7.31 +/- 0.07 (p less than 0.01). The subendocardial pH of the zone not infused with vasopressin did not change. To overcome the intrinsic regulation of blood flow, operating primarily in small coronary arteries, we hypothesized that vasopressin must increase resistance primarily in large rather than small coronary arteries. After intracoronary infusion in group 3 (n = 6), however, most (94%) of the increase in resistance during vasopressin administration was explained by an increase of resistance in small coronary arteries. In group 4 (n = 9), vasopressin decreased coronary blood flow by 50% and decreased local shortening by 90% at a time when systemic hemodynamics were unchanged. Coronary constriction induced by vasopressin, or the recovery from it, also was not altered by cyclooxygenase blockade. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, vasopressin produces myocardial ischemia by constricting small, nondiseased coronary arteries severely enough to overcome the competition from normal coronary regulation, and this ischemic event is not mediated by prostaglandin products. 
Clinical characteristics of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced angioedema. We present the cases of two patients with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema that required intubation for life-threatening airway compromise. This side effect has been previously reported with all ACE inhibitors, but its incidence and potential for a fatal outcome may not be fully appreciated. A review of the literature reveals 227 reports of this reaction with an overall incidence of approximately 0.1% to 0.2%. The etiology is nonimmunogenic and thought to be related to accentuated bradykinin activity. There is no clinical profile that identifies patients at increased risk for this side effect. There are unique clinical characteristics to this idiosyncratic reaction: angioedema may suddenly occur even though the drug has been well tolerated for months or years; symptoms may regress spontaneously while the patient continues the medication, erroneously prompting an alternative diagnosis; the pathology has a special predilection for the tongue, a circumstance that renders orotracheal and nasotracheal intubation difficult; symptoms may progress rapidly despite aggressive medical therapy, necessitating emergency airway procedures; and a rebound phenomenon following successful medical therapy has been described. We recommend intensive medical treatment before angioedema is severe enough to thwart standard methods to ensure a protected airway. Once even minor angioedema is attributed to an ACE inhibitor, an alternative class of antihypertensive medication should be chosen. Individuals with a history of idiopathic angioedema probably should not be given ACE inhibitors. 
Imaging of cystic and cavitary lesions of the spinal cord and canal. The value of MR and intraoperative sonography. This article discusses the utility and technique of magnetic resonance imaging and intraoperative spinal sonography in the evaluation of cystic and cavitary lesions of the spinal cord and canal. The pathophysiology and fluid dynamics of these lesions are also discussed. 
Metabolism of prostaglandin F2 alpha in Zellweger syndrome. Peroxisomal beta-oxidation is a major importance for in vivo degradation of prostaglandins in humans. We have recently shown in vitro that the peroxisomal fraction of a rat liver homogenate has the highest capacity to beta-oxidize prostaglandins. In order to evaluate the relative importance of peroxisomes for this conversion also in vivo, we administered [3H]prostaglandin F2 alpha to an infant suffering from Zellweger syndrome, a congenital disorder characterized by the absence of intact peroxisomes. As a control, labeled compound was administered to two healthy volunteers. Urine was collected, fractionated on a SEP-PAK C18 cartridge, and subjected to reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The Zellweger patient was found to excrete prostaglandin metabolites considerably less polar than those of the control subjects. The major urinary metabolite in the control subjects was practically absent in the urine from the Zellweger patient. The major urinary prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite from the Zellweger patient was identified as an omega-oxidized C20-prostaglandin, 9,11-dihydroxy-15-oxoprost-5-ene-1,20-dioic acid. The major urinary prostaglandin F2 alpha metabolite from the control subjects had chromatographic properties of a tetranor (C16) prostaglandin, in accordance with earlier published data. The present results, in combination with our previous in vitro data, indicate that peroxisomal beta-oxidation is of major importance for in vivo chain shortening of prostaglandins. 
Single photon emission computed tomography in patients with acute hydrocephalus or with cerebral ischaemia after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cerebral blood flow was studied in eight patients with gradual deterioration in the level of consciousness after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Four had cerebral ischaemia and four had acute hydrocephalus. In patients with cerebral ischaemia, single photon emission computed tomography scanning showed multiple regions with decreased uptake of technetium-99M labelled d,l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (99mTcHM-PAO) mainly in watershed areas. In patients with acute hydrocephalus, decreased uptake was seen mainly in the basal parts of the brain: around the third ventricle, around the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and in the basal part of the frontal lobe. After serial lumbar puncture, there was improvement of the uptake of 99mTc HM-PAO in these basal areas in three (convincingly in two and slightly in the other) of the four patients accompanied by clinical improvement in these three patients. These results suggest that patients with acute hydrocephalus and impaired consciousness after SAH, in contrast to patients with cerebral ischaemia, have decreased cerebral blood flow predominantly in the basal parts of the brain. 
Long-term patient survival after cystectomy for regional metastatic transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. The records of 280 patients who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and radical cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder between 1971 and 1986 were reviewed. A total of 42 patients had either 1 (stage pN1) or more than 1 (stage pN2) positive lymph nodes (20 and 22 patients, respectively). The over-all 3-year survival rate for patients with positive lymph nodes was 27%, and it was 30 and 18.5% for stages pN1 and pN2 disease, respectively. Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed a sustained survival advantage for stage pN1 over pN2 disease for the first 3 years (p less than 0.05) but the difference was not significant at 5 years of followup. Eleven patients with negative lymph nodes but local extension of tumor into the prostatic stroma and/or ducts had a 5-year survival rate of 36%, which equaled the survival of 49 stage pT3b,pN0 cancer patients in the same series. Surgical mortality for the entire population of 280 patients was 2.1% and there was no increase in mortality or morbidity among the node positive patients. Based on the findings of improved survival of stages pN1 and pT3b,N0 cancer patients compared to stage pN2 cancer patients, the tumor, nodes and metastasis classification offers more specific prognostic information than does a single designation of Jewett stage D disease. 
Acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and cardiovascular collapse in a young child owing to environmentally acquired cocaine. Acute crack cocaine intoxication has become a significant problem in both adolescent and adult patients. Recently, cases of cocaine toxicity in infants and toddlers have been described. We report a four-year-old child with acute hemorrhagic diarrhea and shock after intoxication by crack cocaine. Acute cocaine intoxication should be considered in the differential for hemorrhagic diarrhea and shock. The gastrointestinal decontamination following cocaine ingestion is discussed. 
Osteoid osteoma. Diagnosis, localization, and treatment. The preoperative insertion of a needle under computed tomographic scan, performed under local anesthesia, is a convenient and important new way to localize the nidus in osteoid osteoma. It necessitates less bone removal, which should reduce the postoperative fracture rate. It should also help to locate the lesion during surgery. Some clinical points and previously unstressed pathologic findings are also discussed. 
Attitudes of family practice residents about speech-language-hearing referrals. The "family doctor" has been identified as the professional most likely to be contacted by the general public with concerns about communication disorders; yet the family practice physician is unlikely to refer patients with communicative disorders to speech-language pathologists or audiologists for nonmedical evaluation and treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine attitudes of family practice residents about referral patterns for communication disorders using a survey format. Thirty-nine residents estimated that they had referred an average of 1.5 patients to a speech-language pathologist and 2.2 patients to an audiologist during a six-month interval. The findings indicated that these residents did not routinely refer patients to speech-language pathologists. When they did refer, a limited view of communication problems was used. 
An open-label trial of fluoxetine for obsessive-compulsive disorder in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) occurs commonly in association with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) and can be a major source of disability. Fluoxetine, a new antidepressant, has been effective for psychiatric patients with OCD. We conducted an open-label trial of fluoxetine (20 to 40 mg/d) for 32 GTS patients with OCD. After 1 week of treatment, six patients (16%) withdrew from the trial due to perceived lack of benefit. Data were analyzed for 26 patients (13 children and 13 adults) who were treated by a neurologist for 3 to 8 months. Following treatment, there was a significant reduction in scores on the Leyton Obsessional Inventory for both the adult and child groups, and 81% of patients reported a subjective improvement in obsessions and compulsions. Since fluoxetine was well tolerated, our findings indicate that the drug may be an effective agent for the treatment of OCD in GTS patients. 
Instantaneous hyperemic flow-versus-pressure slope index. Microsphere validation of an alternative to measures of coronary reserve. BACKGROUND. The instantaneous hyperemic flow-versus-pressure (i-HFVP) slope index is a new method of assessing maximal coronary conductance and can be used as an alternative to conventional measures of coronary reserve. The i-HFVP slope index is determined by measuring the slope of the linear diastolic segment of the relation between instantaneous aortic pressure and hyperemic coronary flow. METHODS AND RESULTS. To validate the i-HFVP slope index as a measure of maximal coronary conductance, we compared this method with a microsphere-derived measurement of maximal coronary conductance (m-HFVP slope index) by determining the slope of the least-squares regression line of the data points for coronary flow during maximal hyperemia and four or five steady-state alterations of aortic pressure in 43 dogs (open-chest, anesthetized preparations) with or without coronary stenoses. The i-HFVP slope index demonstrated no dependence on heart rate, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, or mean aortic pressure and was highly reproducible within the groups studied (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.86 for normal arteries, 0.87 for stenotic arteries, and 0.93 for combined groups; for all coefficients, p less than 0.001). The i-HFVP slope index was significantly decreased in the presence of a stenosis (10.3 +/- 3.9 for normal arteries versus 3.6 +/- 1.6 for stenotic arteries, p less than 0.001) as was the transmural m-HFVP slope index (8.9 +/- 4.6 for normal arteries versus 5.3 +/- 3.1, p less than 0.01). Of special importance, the i-HFVP slope index measurement for normal arteries was not significantly different from the transmural and subendocardial m-HFVP slope index measurements (10.3 +/- 3.9 versus 8.9 +/- 4.6 and 9.2 +/- 5.7, respectively). For stenotic arteries, the i-HFVP slope index measurement was also not significantly different from the transmural and subendocardial m-HFVP slope index measurements (3.6 +/- 1.6 versus 5.3 +/- 3.1 and 4.1 +/- 2.3, respectively). The i-HFVP slope index correlated best with subendocardial m-HFVP slope index measurements (correlation coefficient, 0.57; p less than 0.001). When the 95% confidence intervals for the transmural (or subendocardial) m-HFVP slope index in normal arteries were compared with the i-HFVP slope index values, the latter demonstrated a systematic trend to overestimate the m-HFVP slope index. In the presence of a stenosis, this effect was minimized, and the slope values were nearly identical. CONCLUSIONS. The i-HFVP slope index correlates most closely with subendocardial coronary conductance; the index is a hemodynamically independent measure of coronary reserve that is reproducible over a broad range of aortic pressures; and the methodology is applicable to an intact circulation in experimental preparations and may with future developments also prove useful in humans. 
Duplex Doppler sonography of the hepatic vein in tricuspid regurgitation. Patients with tricuspid regurgitation may present initially with vague abdominal symptoms and elevated liver enzymes. In the absence of diagnostic sonographic findings, patients may be subjected to an unnecessary invasive liver biopsy for an accurate diagnosis. We recently described the association of the pulsatile portal venous waveform on duplex Doppler sonography with tricuspid regurgitation in 15 patients. In this study I describe the changes in the hepatic venous waveform in these patients and compare the findings with the final diagnosis as determined by Doppler echocardiography (n = 14) or ultrafast CT (n = 1). All patients had clinical findings consistent with liver dysfunction and were referred for sonography to rule out diseases of the liver, biliary tree, or hepatic or portal veins. All patients had persistently dilated hepatic veins and inferior venae cavae. Twenty-four volunteers, 11 of whom had simultaneous ECG tracings, served as a control group. The main findings on the hepatic duplex sonogram in the disease group were a decrease in the size of the antegrade systolic wave with a systolic/diastolic flow velocity ratio of less than 0.6 (n = 4) or reversal of the systolic wave (n = 10). In all volunteers, systolic flow was antegrade and the ratio was more than 0.6. Two diagnoses were false positive and one was false negative. In some patients with sonographic signs of congestive heart failure, duplex Doppler sonography of the hepatic vein may be helpful in the diagnosis of one of the causes of liver dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation. 
Dysplastic nevi. Occurrence in first- and second-degree relatives of patients with 'sporadic' dysplastic nevus syndrome. In this study a cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 156 living family members of 31 probands originally classified as having sporadic (histologically verified) dysplastic nevus syndrome (DNS). Seven (13.2%) of 53 parents had clinically recognizable DNS. Twenty-six (36.1%) of the 72 sibs showed dysplastic nevi. The diagnosis of DNS in family members was based on mainly clinical examination; in eight family members--those with only mild manifestation of DNS--a nevus was removed for histologic confirmation. After correction for pedigree size, we found that 60% of patients with "type A sporadic" DNS actually had one or more relatives with a DNS phenotype. Only 25% (8/30) of the probands were ultimately true sporadic cases without a DNS-affected first- or second-degree relative. In 15% (5/31) of the probands no conclusions concerning the type of DNS could be made because the pedigree size did not allow such a conclusion. We also found a higher prevalence of dysplastic nevi among the younger generation as compared with the older generation in our probands with DNS and their families as well as in a general population study of 400 individuals. This generation-dependent difference in expression of the DNS phenotype suggests that besides a genetic factor, other factors may play a role in the development of the characteristic phenotype. 
The difficult dilation: a method for dilation of severe esophageal strictures in children. Occasionally severe esophageal strictures will develop in children that will not allow the passage of standard Jackson or bougie dilators. These small strictures can be successfully treated using a standard intubating laryngoscope for visualization and Rush urethral Filiform dilators. 
Pyoderma gangrenosum with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma manifested as lower extremity ulcers--case reports. Patients with extensive lower extremity ulcerations initially thought to be vascular disease were subsequently proved to have pyoderma gangrenosum and malignant lymphoma. Both patients died of sepsis; one patient exhibited hypogammaglobulinemia involving immunoglobulins IgA, IgG, and IgE; in the second patient, a polyclonal excess involving IgA and IgE was present. 
Electrophysiological effects of left ventricular hypertrophy. Effect of calcium and potassium channel blockade. BACKGROUND. To define the arrhythmogenic effects of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the intact heart, we carried out a detailed electrophysiological assessment in our previously validated feline aortic-banding model and then tested the effects of agents that blocked either the slow inward calcium or voltage-dependent potassium channel. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured intraventricular and interventricular conduction times, excitability thresholds, ventricular effective refractory periods, and monophasic action potential duration at several sites in cats with LVH as well as in concurrent control (sham-operated) cats. In addition, we assessed vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmia using direct measurement of ventricular fibrillation (VF) thresholds and by standard techniques of programmed stimulation. Despite finding no difference between LVH and sham-operated cats in mean values for several electrophysiological parameters, the former group was significantly more vulnerable to VF, with more spontaneous VF and lower VF thresholds. Compared with the sham controls, LVH cats also had a greater dispersion of effective refractory period (35 +/- 11 versus 12 +/- 4 msec, p less than 0.01) and monophasic action potential duration at 90% repolarization (69 +/- 25 versus 39 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.02). Verapamil had no significant effect on these electrophysiological parameters, nor did it affect VF threshold. However, risotilide, an inhibitor of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, narrowed dispersion of the effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration concomitant with a marked reduction in ventricular vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS. LVH has a pronounced effect on dispersion of refractoriness and repolarization and renders the ventricle more vulnerable to fibrillation. Blockade of the voltage-dependent potassium channel, but not the slow inward calcium channel, narrows the dispersion of recovery of excitability and protects against VF. 
A comparative study of the cerebrovascular complications of cocaine: alkaloidal versus hydrochloride--a review. Cocaine, especially in its alkaloidal or "crack" form, has been increasingly associated with cerebrovascular disease. Before the crack epidemic, cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) was also implicated as a cause of stroke. However, less is known about the differences in stroke subtypes, age at stroke onset, or presence of underlying structural cerebrovascular disease with different forms of cocaine use. We compared 26 patients (previously reported) from our four institutions plus 16 cases reported in the literature of stroke associated with alkaloidal cocaine to 63 (57 reported in the literature and six not previously reported from our four institutions) cases of stroke associated with cocaine HCl. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are equally likely after alkaloidal cocaine use, whereas cocaine HCl is more likely (approximately 80% of the time) to cause hemorrhagic stroke, with approximately half the intracranial hemorrhages occurring from ruptured cerebral saccular aneurysms or vascular malformations. The presence of an underlying cerebral aneurysm was more common among patients with cocaine HCl-associated strokes than alkaloidal cocaine-associated strokes. Cerebral infarction was significantly more common among the alkaloidal cocaine users than in all the cocaine HCl users, and this was also true when alkaloidal cocaine users were compared with parenteral cocaine HCl (intravenous and intramuscular) users. Only hemorrhagic stroke has been reported with intravenous cocaine HCl use. We conclude that the pathogenesis of cocaine-related stroke is heterogeneous, and depends, in part, on the form of cocaine used. 
Spinal intramedullary ependymal cyst. Report of three cases. Three cases of spinal intramedullary ependymal cyst, two at the thoracolumbar junction and one in the cervical spinal cord, are reported in women in their fifth to seventh decades. Neurological signs and symptoms were extremity dysesthesias, paresthesias, and weakness. Plain cervical and lumbothoracic x-ray films were normal for the patients' age. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging demonstrated a rounded cystic intramedullary mass at the thoracolumbar junction in two cases and at C3-7 in one case. The signal intensity of the cyst contents approximated that of cerebrospinal fluid on T1- and T2-weighted images. Upon administration of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA), MR imaging showed no enhancement in the cyst wall or cavity. Myelotomy and cyst drainage were performed in each case, and the neurological status of each patient improved. The lining of the cyst was biopsied in one of the three patients undergoing surgery and was composed of a single layer of cuboidal cells supported by glial tissue. Periodic acid-Schiff staining of the tissue did not reveal a basement membrane. The findings in these cases suggest that the Gd-DTPA-enhanced MR imaging appearance of intramedullary spinal ependymal cyst is consistent and allows for accurate preoperative diagnosis with or without biopsy. 
In vivo detection of somatostatin receptors in patients with functionless pituitary adenomas by means of a radioiodinated analog of somatostatin ([123I]SDZ 204-090). The recent availability of a Tyr3-substituted octreotide (SDZ 204-090) for radioiodination has allowed somatostatin (SRIH) receptor binding to be studied in vivo, and receptor-positive tumors of different origins to be visualized with a gamma-camera. This prompted us to investigate whether this compound could be used for external imaging of functionless pituitary adenomas displaying SRIH receptors. Eight patients with functionless pituitary adenomas, three patients with acromegaly, and three with macroprolactinoma were injected iv with 123I-labeled Tyr3-octreotide and then scanned with a gamma-camera. Positive scans were obtained in the three acromegalics and in two of the eight patients with functionless pituitary tumors. The patients with macroprolactinoma had negative scans. The diagnosis of functionless pituitary adenomas was confirmed by light and electron microscopic examination as well as immunocytochemical studies. In vitro binding of [125I]Tyr11-SRIH to cell membranes was evaluated in four functionless and three GH-secreting adenomas removed from seven of the patients. All of the GH-secreting as well as one of the four functionless adenomas had high affinity SRIH-binding sites, without differences in number or affinity, whereas SRIH-binding sites were not detected in the others. Positive scans were observed only in patients bearing tumors with high affinity SRIH-binding sites. In conclusion, [123I]Tyr3-octreotide appears to be a promising tool for singling out, in vivo, patients with functionless pituitary tumors displaying SRIH receptors who might potentially benefit from octreotide treatment. 
The growing teratoma syndrome. A 26-year-old man presented with multiple pulmonary nodules and a left testicular mass. Combination chemotherapy for a malignant, mixed germ cell testicular tumor resulted in shrinkage of the pulmonary nodules and normalization of the tumor markers (beta-HCG, LDH and AFP). Subsequent surgical excision performed for enlargement of the pulmonary nodules revealed mature teratomas, diagnostic of the GTS. 
Transient myocardial ischemia during Holter registration before and after coronary angioplasty. PURPOSE: Revascularizing procedures like percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) aim at reducing the incidence and severity of myocardial ischemia. To evaluate this, continuous Holter ST analysis is a possible method. DESIGN: 41 patients (35 men, 6 women) with stable angina pectoris had continuous twenty-four-hour two-channel Holter registration (V5/aVF-analogous leads) recorded before and after PTCA. Transient myocardial ischemia (TM) was defined as 0.1 mV ST depression or more 80 msec after the J point for one minute or more. FINDINGS: PTCA was successful for 37 patients (90%). Eleven of these had a total of 53 episodes of TM, 36 (68%) before and 17 (32%) after PTCA (p less than 0.05). Fifteen episodes (28%) were symptomatic, and 38 (72%) were asymptomatic. Six patients had TM after successful PTCA, 5 of whom had one-vessel disease and a clinically uncomplicated course. One patient had multivessel disease, with only one vessel dilated. Follow-up angiograms for 9 of the 11 patients with TM revealed 5 restenoses. There was no significant correlation between TM after PTCA and subsequent restenosis (p greater than 0.05). IMPLICATIONS: TM is common in patients with stable angina pectoris. The incidence significantly decreases after successful PTCA, but TM is seen also with a clinically uncomplicated course. In multivessel disease this is consistent with incomplete revascularization, whereas in single-vessel disease the most likely cause is intermittent spasm or thrombosis. TM after successful PTCA does not seem to be a predictor of restenosis. 
The infrequent association of systemic lupus erythematosus and solid tumors. The authors describe the clinical course of two patients with long-standing, indolent systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) who developed, respectively, a breast carcinoma and a malignant melanoma 8 and 15 years after the diagnosis of lupus; both patients died with evidence of widespread, rapidly progressive metastatic disease at a time when the SLE was minimally active and did not require immunosuppressive therapy. The association of SLE and solid tumors in the same patient is reviewed. The frequency of this association appears to be low and the most often described tumors are of uterine and bladder origin. The clinical course of the solid malignancy in these patients is not always described in detail. Careful epidemiologic studies on the true incidence of solid tumors in patients with SLE are required to better understand this association. 
Sodium regulation in the affinity of renal alpha 2-adrenoceptors for epinephrine in Sabra salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats. Sodium ions markedly decreased in vitro renal alpha 2-adrenoceptor affinity for epinephrine in Sabra hypertensive (SBH) but not in normotensive (SBN) rats. Under these conditions, affinity of alpha 1-adrenoceptor for epinephrine was unchanged in SBH and SBN rats. If these data could be confirmed in vivo, the sodium ion, by acting as an inhibitor, could modify the effect of agonists on renal alpha 2-adrenoceptors in SBH rats. Conversely, the absence of sodium regulation in SBN rats might represent a genetically mediated change responsible for the resistance to the development of salt-induced hypertension. 
Collagenous colitis with involvement of terminal ileum. We present a case of collagenous colitis with evidence of terminal ileal involvement. The patient suffered from chronic watery diarrhea of three months' duration, and colonoscopy revealed a normal endoscopic appearance. Histologic examination of biopsies revealed a broad subepithelial band of collagen, with similar histologic findings in the terminal ileum. Additionally, the patient exhibited abnormalities of d-xylose and vitamin B12 absorption, although there were no clinical signs of malabsorption. Biopsy of the proximal small intestine was normal. The significance of these findings for the definition of the clinicopathologic entity of collagenous colitis and its pathogenesis are discussed. 
Realistic expectations for the patient with intermittent claudication. To determine the natural history of intermittent claudication 112 patients were followed for a minimum of 5 years and a median period of 82 months. Thirty-seven patients (33 per cent) died during the study period. Myocardial infarction (44 per cent) and cerebrovascular disease (28 per cent) were the most common causes of death. Overall mortality rate was 8, 23 and 40 per cent, at 2, 5 and 8 years respectively. Initial ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) correlated with subsequent death. With an initial ABPI less than 0.5 death occurred in 20, 50 and 69 per cent at 2, 5 and 7 years respectively, compared with 5, 16 and 24 per cent respectively for those with an initial ABPI greater than or equal to 0.5 (P less than 0.0001). Of the survivors only 21 per cent had worsening claudication and 13 per cent progressed to critical ischaemia. Arterial bypass for limb salvage was required in eight patients and four limbs were lost during the study period. ABPI identifies a subgroup of claudicants with an extremely high risk of death from coronary and/or cerebral pathology. In this subgroup an aggressive approach to the correction of atherosclerotic risk factors, rather than emphasis on the peripheral vascular problem alone, may improve survival. 
Management of the failed exstrophy closure. In the last 5 years we have seen 15 boys and 9 girls with failure of exstrophy closure, including 20 who had classical bladder exstrophy and 4 who had cloacal exstrophy. At the time of presentation 18 patients had undergone 1 closure while 6 patients had undergone 2 prior exstrophy closures. Closure was performed for complete bladder dehiscence in 16 cases and for significant bladder prolapse in 8. None of the patients underwent any form of osteotomy at the time of initial closure and in 19 closure was done within 72 hours of birth. Two patients underwent posterior iliac osteotomy elsewhere at the time of secondary closure. All patients referred to our institution underwent either posterior iliac osteotomy (8 patients) or anterior innominate osteotomy (16 patients). Epispadias repair along with reclosure of bladder exstrophy was done in 13 boys. The upper tract remained normal in all patients. There were no instances of failure in this group of reclosures. Eight patients have undergone subsequent bladder neck reconstruction of whom 7 are dry for 4 hours and 1 remains totally incontinent. Two patients have undergone simultaneous bladder neck reconstruction and augmentation cystoplasty, and they are dry on intermittent self-catheterization. The failed exstrophy closure presents a formidable dilemma. However, a secure reclosure can be achieved with careful surgical technique, a well performed osteotomy (even if previously performed) and concomitant epispadias repair for male subjects. 
Ascites and pleural effusions associated with endometriosis. We report a case of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions associated with an endometrioma in a 26-year-old woman of Chinese descent. She had a right salpingo-oophorectomy and partial omentectomy performed, and she received leuprolide acetate depot injections after the operation. We believe this is the first description of use of a GnRH agonist to treat this rare condition. 
Aortic sepsis: is there a role for in situ graft reconstruction? Conventional extraanatomic reconstruction for aortic sepsis is associated with a significant risk of operative death, as well as frequent late complications. We evaluated in situ aortic grafting in the treatment of primary or graft-related aortic infection. Eleven selected patients underwent in situ aortic graft reconstruction in the setting of mycotic aneurysm (n = 5), secondarily infected aortic aneurysm (n = 1), primary aortoenteric fistula (n = 1), and secondary aortoenteric fistula (n = 4). All patients survived: follow-up from 10 to 130 months reveals no evidence for graft thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, new or recurrent aortoenteric fistula, or subsequent aortic operations in any patient. A literature review produced 110 cases of aortic sepsis managed by in situ aortic reconstruction during the last decade. Thirty-two patients (29%) either died in the operative period or suffered a lethal late complication associated with their aortic reconstruction. This mortality rate declined to 21% if patients undergoing incomplete removal of a contaminated graft were excluded, and to 19% with the addition of our 11 patients. Both our experience and that described in the literature suggest that, in properly-selected patients, in situ aortic graft replacement may be a rational treatment option for localized or circumscribed aortic sepsis. 
Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia after resection of thoracic esophageal cancer. The rate of occurrence of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia (PHB) following esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer was 67%, 115/171 cases, which was significantly higher than those following total gastrectomy (28%, 40/144 cases) and colectomy (12%, 7/59 cases). Among the operative procedures, right thoracotomy with extensive lymphoadenectomy had the highest rate of PHB (87%), perhaps due to the longest operation time and the largest intraoperative blood loss. Preoperative risk factors were glucose intolerance, reduced lymphocyte count, and poor nutritional state. The change in bile acid composition, as well as the elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, indicated the presence of postoperative cholestasis which was relevant to total parenteral nutrition. The results suggest that the development of PHB was related to the extent of surgery and the use of parenteral nutrition. 
A comparative analysis of Giliberty, Bateman, and Universal femoral head prostheses. A long-term follow-up evaluation. This study compares four different types of bipolar hip prostheses used from 1977 to 1984. The devices studied were the Giliberty I and II hip prostheses, the Bateman I prosthesis, and the Universal Hip Replacement (UHR) prosthesis. The surgical indications for prosthetic hip replacement in all cases were displaced subcapital hip fractures (Garden Types 3 and 4). Postoperative evaluation included D'Aubigne's hip rating system and roentgenograms to assess prosthetic placement, dislocation, disassembly of the components, and the presence of inner and outer bearing motion of the prostheses. Results of the study revealed intact inner bearing motion in all of the devices investigated in the immediate postoperative period. The UHR prosthesis demonstrated a statistically significant lower incidence of dislocation and no incidence of prosthesis disassembly. This study demonstrates the superiority of the bipolar prosthesis when compared to published results of the so-called unipolar prosthesis and also suggests superiority of the design and function of the UHR prosthesis when compared to the Bateman I and Giliberty prostheses. Longer follow-up evaluation is needed to assess the effects of a functioning bipolar prosthesis on acetabular wear. 
Pancreatic lesions in the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Common manifestations of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, an autosomally dominant inherited cancer-prone disorder, include retinal angiomatosis, hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system, renal cysts, renal cancer, pheochromocytoma, and epididymal cystadenoma. Multiple cysts and microcystic (serous) cystadenomas of the pancreas have also been reported occasionally in patients afflicted with this syndrome. In the large Freiburg study of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome composed of 66 affected individuals, pancreatic lesions were systematically studied. Fifty-five living individuals were examined by abdominal ultrasound imaging. Abnormal findings were confirmed by computed tomographic scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging. For an additional 11 decreased patients autopsy data were available. Cystic lesions of the pancreas were found in 10 patients (15%). One of these patients presented with multiple pancreatic cysts as the only manifestation of the syndrome. In one patient, a malignant islet-cell tumor was found at autopsy. Because multiple pancreatic cysts did not cause major clinical symptoms and because follow-up examinations over an average period of 5 years did not show significant progression of the lesions, it is concluded that these patients usually do not require surgical treatment. Abdominal ultrasound screening is recommended for patients at risk as a tool to identify potential von Hippel-Lindau syndrome gene carriers with pancreatic manifestations. In all patients with multiple pancreatic cysts, the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis. 
Preventive practices for adult cardiovascular disease in children. BACKGROUND. Differences between family practitioners and pediatricians regarding appropriate interventions for cardiovascular disease prevention in pediatric patients have been described by national surveys of physicians in the two specialties. the purpose of the study reported here was to determine whether similar differences existed in a more complete sample from a confined geographical area in which local standards of care might influence physicians practicing in the locale. METHODS. Members of the Southwestern Ohio Society of Family Physicians and the Cincinnati Pediatric Society were surveyed by questionnaire about their attitudes and practices concerning cardiovascular risk factors in children. The response rate was greater than 70% in each specialty group. RESULTS. Differences in the diagnosis and treatment of hypercholesterolemia were detected: (1) pediatricians screened patients at younger ages and used lower cutoff points for diagnosis (5.0 vs 5.5 mmol/L [192 vs 211 mg/dL]); and (2) family physicians were more likely to treat with medication (57% vs 5%), whereas pediatricians referred hypercholesterolemic patients to specialists more often (71% vs 19%). Both family physicians and pediatricians mislabeled blood pressures at the age-specific 90th percentile as normal (21% and 14%, respectively); this occurred more commonly with younger patients. Blood pressure was the risk factor most often measured, but smoking was the risk factor that received the most counseling by physicians in both specialties. CONCLUSIONS. Both family physicians and pediatricians reported feeling inadequately prepared to counsel lifestyle changes, and ranked obesity, smoking, and cholesterol as topics of greatest interest for continuing medical education courses. Physicians in both specialties did not routinely update family history of cardiovascular disease during well-child visits. 
Prevention of cerebral vasospasm by actinomycin D. The role of endothelin, a newly found vasoconstrictor peptide, is examined in the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the dog. Endothelin immunoreactivity was overexpressed in the endothelium of the vasospastic basilar artery. Because endothelin synthesis is regulated at the messenger ribonucleic acid transcription level, the effect of actinomycin D, a ribonucleic acid synthesis inhibitor, was studied as a means of preventing vasospasm. It was found that treatment with intravenous actinomycin D for 5 days beginning on the day of SAH completely inhibited the development of vasospasm. This novel experimental therapy may lead not only to the elucidation of the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm but also to the availability of a prophylactic adjuvant therapy for patients with SAH. 
Liver involvement in Alpers disease. Alpers disease consists of diffuse cerebral degeneration manifested as developmental delay, seizures, vomiting, and progressive neuromuscular deterioration, with liver disease and death. We report the clinical course of the liver disease, histologic progression of the hepatic lesions, and etiologic investigations in five patients (four girls, three kinships). All had grown and developed normally until seen at 6 to 36 months of age (mean 20 months), with vomiting (n = 5), progressive hypotonia (n = 3), or seizures (n = 2). All had been given anticonvulsants, including valproic acid in three. Liver disease was noted at a mean age of 35 months (range 9 to 67 months), with hepatomegaly (two patients), abnormal hepatic synthetic function (three) or transaminase values (three), and cirrhosis in one. Patients survived for a mean of 4.6 weeks (range 1 to 8 weeks) after the identification of liver disease; all died of hepatic failure. Results of evaluation for infectious and metabolic causes of liver disease and causes of degenerative neuromuscular disease were negative in all patients. Premortem liver biopsy specimens (n = 3) demonstrated an early lesion consisting of lobular disarray, microvesicular steatosis, periportal acute and chronic inflammation, and individual hepatocyte necrosis. Autopsy findings (n = 5) consisted of macrovesicular steatosis, massive hepatocyte dropout, and proliferation of bile ductular elements, with almost complete replacement of hepatocytes by proliferating bile ductular elements in two patients. Brain showed characteristic neuronal degeneration. We conclude that Alpers disease can be a cause of rapidly progressive liver failure in early childhood. Although the cause of this autosomal recessive disease is not known, it does not appear to be related to peroxisomal dysfunction. 
Cardiovascular and antiarrhythmic effects of esmolol in children. This prospective study evaluated the cardiovascular and antiarrhythmic effects of esmolol, an intravenous beta-blocker with an extremely short half-life. Twenty patients (aged 2 to 16 years) underwent diagnostic electrophysiologic studies at rest and during beta-blockade induced with esmolol. An initial dose of 600 micrograms/kg was infused for 2 minutes and followed by an infusion of 200 micrograms/kg per minute. The dosage was increased by 50 to 100 micrograms/kg per minute every 5 to 10 minutes until a reduction of greater than 10% in either heart rate or mean blood pressure was seen. The dosage required to achieve beta-blockade ranged from 300 to 1000 micrograms/kg per minute (mean 550 micrograms/kg per minute). Electrophysiologic effects included a decrease in the rate of sinoatrial node discharge and delay in conduction through the atrioventricular node. There was no effect on His-Purkinje conduction. Atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods were unchanged. In six patients with supraventricular tachycardia, esmolol prevented induction of tachycardia in four and slowed the rate of the tachycardia in two. In four patients with ventricular tachycardia, clinical findings were improved in three and unchanged in one. Heart rate and blood pressure returned to near baseline values 10 minutes after the esmolol infusion was stopped. Adverse ventricular electrophysiologic effects were observed in two patients with biopsy evidence of myocarditis. No other adverse effects were seen. We conclude that the effects of esmolol in children are similar to those of other beta-blockers and that it is useful in the evaluation and management of pediatric tachyarrhythmias. The weight-adjusted dosage required to induce beta-blockade in children is larger than the adult dosage, and the effects of esmolol dissipate rapidly. 
Low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) vs dextran 70. The prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. The Danish Enoxaparin Study Group. A prospective randomized study compared the thromboprophylactic efficacy and safety of a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), enoxaparin (40.6 mg subcutaneously once daily), with a standard regimen of dextran 70 in patients undergoing elective total hip replacement. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by bilateral ascending phlebography 7 to 11 days after operation. Two hundred forty-six patients were included and 219 were eligible for analysis. Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed in seven of 108 patients in the LMWH group and in 24 of 111 patients in the dextran group. Clinical symptoms of pulmonary embolism did not develop in any patients during the study. In the postoperative period, patients receiving LMWH had a lower blood loss in drains and required fewer blood transfusions than patients receiving dextran, although no significant differences were noted between the groups with respect to the total number of blood transfusions required. Bleeding events and adverse events did not differ between the groups. None of the patients died in hospital during the study. One patient in the LMWH group died at home 15 days after the operation. Three patients receiving dextran had development of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis after hospital discharge. In conclusion, enoxaparin was a more effective thromboprophylactic than a standard regimen of dextran in patients undergoing total hip replacement. The two regimens were equally safe under the clinical conditions. 
Radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy for treatment of early stage cervical cancer: clinical experience of 278 cases. This study includes 278 cases of stage I and II cervical cancer subjected to radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy. The clinical experience of 278 cases is reviewed. Of these cases, 215 were in stage I, and 63 were in stage II. Intraoperative complications occurred at a rate of 9.7% and involved injuries to the great vessels, lower urinary tract, nerves, and rectum. Operative mortality was found to be 0.3%. Postoperative complications were observed in 20.1% of patients. Fistulae were observed in 8 (2.8%) patients. The overall survival rate was 83.8%. The 5-year survival rates for stages IA, IB, IIA, and IIB were 100.0%, 87.9%, 71.0%, and 64.0%, respectively. Pelvic lymph node metastases varied from 0% for stage IA to 40.0% for stage IIB and paraaortic involvement varied from 0% for stage IA to 50.0% for stage IIB. Radical surgery seems to be the treatment of choice for patients with early invasive cervical cancer. 
Children with epilepsy: the effect of seizures, syndromes, and etiological factors on cognitive functioning. Overall, children with epilepsy have poorer concentration and mental processing and are less alert than age-matched controls. The relationship between cognitive functioning and epilepsy is complex, however, with widely differing degrees of intellectual impairment--ranging from minimal to severe and progressive--related to diverse types of epileptic seizures, syndromes, and etiological factors. Prolonged and frequently repeated seizures are typically associated with more severe effects on cognitive functioning, particularly if epilepsy is symptomatic, i.e., secondary to a demonstrable brain lesion. A combination of such factors may contribute to the mental deterioration seen in many children suffering from severe epilepsy. 
The Western Washington Myocardial Infarction Registry and Emergency Department Tissue Plasminogen Activator Treatment Trial. This study comprised a registry and an emergency department treatment trial using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. During 1 year, 1,028 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were evaluated for eligibility for thrombolytic therapy. Of these, 221 patients (22%) were eligible for thrombolytic therapy under currently accepted criteria, 175 (79%) of them were correctly identified by emergency department physicians for thrombolytic therapy, and 160 were enrolled in the trial. Only 3 patients (2%) enrolled by emergency department physicians did not subsequently evolve documented AMI. In all, 807 patients (78%) were ineligible for thrombolytic therapy: 335 (33%) because of greater than or equal to 1 contraindications, 364 (36%) because of nondiagnostic electrocardiograms on presentation, and 105 (10%) because of age greater than 75 years, or greater than 6 hours of chest pain at presentation, or both. Mortality in treated patients at 14 days was 5.6%, and survival at 1 year was 92%. The mean time from hospital arrival to thrombolytic treatment was 55 +/- 27 minutes. Initial management of AMI with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the emergency department provided rapid and safe treatment comparable to that reported in trials that started treatment in the coronary care unit. The proportions of eligible patients could be increased from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3, if patients currently excluded only because of age greater than 75 years or because of greater than 6 hours of chest pain were offered treatment. 
Somatosensory and magnetic evoked potentials in a postoperative paraparetic patient: case report. Somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) testing is increasingly being used to test for spinal cord injuries and to monitor spinal surgery to reduce the risk of paraplegia. It is a sensory test, but it is assumed that any process severe enough to affect the motor tracts will also affect the sensory tracts and, therefore, be identified. Increasingly, however, isolated motor-tract involvement has been reported. A new technique, magnetic coil stimulation of the cortex, directly monitors the motor tracts. We report a case where the SSEP was normal although the magnetic motor-evoked potential was abnormal, supporting the hypothesis that direct testing of motor tracts may be advantageous. 
Partial agenesis of the anterior corpus callosum: correlation between appearance, imaging, and neuropathology. Two patients with partial (semilobar) holotelencephaly are reported with apparent partial agenesis of the corpora callosa. These patients are of interest because they appear to possess the posterior portion of the corpus callosum but not its anterior component. Because the corpus callosum develops in the commissural plate rostrally and is elaborated in a rostral-caudal gradient, this apparent lack of the rostral component is embryologically puzzling. The neuropathologic studies of 1 patient resolved the apparent discrepancy between magnetic resonance imaging and embryology of the corpus callosum. With these data, we addressed the embryologic factors that may explain this malformation. 
Nimodipine and bradycardia in acute stroke--drug or disease? A patient who had suffered an acute ischemic stroke experienced bradycardia while being treated with nimodipine 80 mg tid. This became evident after the initiation of nimodipine and progressed, leading to the drug being discontinued after three days of therapy. The bradycardia resolved shortly after the treatment was terminated and normal heart rate was maintained throughout 23 days of hospitalization and in subsequent outpatient follow-up. Although nimodipine-induced bradycardia is possible, hemispheric cerebral infarction may also cause transient bradyarrhythmias in the acute stroke period. There is a need to monitor the heart rate and rhythm of all acute stroke patients, especially those receiving nimodipine. 
Survival and management considerations in postirradiation osteosarcoma and Paget's osteosarcoma. Postirradiation and Paget's osteosarcomas are high-grade malignancies. The five-year survival was only 10% in recent experience at the author's institution. Progressive pain is an important clinical feature in both conditions. Careful roentgenographic studies demonstrate cortical destruction and a soft-tissue mass in virtually all patients. Metastasis was present in 25% of both groups of patients at presentation. In contrast to previous series, more than 80% of the patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma had had irradiation for malignant entities and more than 70% had been treated with modern radiotherapy regimens (cobalt-60 or linear accelerator). Twice as many patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma were evaluated and treated in the 1980s than in the previous decade. The initial indication for irradiation often was carcinoma of the breast, uterus, or cervix, or lymphoma. Two-thirds of the patients had progressive disease that was not controllable within six months after diagnosis. Early detection may be the only effective means of improving survival with postirradiation or Paget's osteosarcoma. These patients require lifelong follow-up evaluations. 
Rupture of the internal elastic lamina and vascular fragility in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied a possible relation between stroke and an enhanced susceptibility to rupture of the arterial internal elastic lamina by comparing stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats with spontaneously hypertensive rats, which have a very low incidence of stroke. We quantified interruptions in the internal elastic lamina in certain arteries and studied the effect of beta-aminopropionitrile, an inhibitor of cross-link formation in collagen and elastic fibers, on rupture of the internal elastic lamina and on mortality in these two substrains. To eliminate any influence of higher blood pressure in the stroke-prone rats on the parameters studied, we used antihypertensive treatment to obtain equivalent blood pressures in the two substrains. Results showed that stroke sensitivity was associated with an enhanced early spontaneous rupture of the internal elastic lamina in the caudal artery, an increased susceptibility to beta-aminopropionitrile-induced rupture of the internal elastic lamina, and earlier mortality, mainly from aortic rupture, under beta-aminopropionitrile treatment. These findings suggest that stroke-prone rats have an enhanced minor connective tissue defect that is expressed by rupture of the internal elastic lamina and may be related, at least in part, to their greater vascular fragility and increased susceptibility to stroke. 
Obstetric accidents: the patient's perspective. Cases from the files of Action for Victims of Medical Accidents which had resulted in stillbirth, perinatal or neonatal death and long term mental or physical handicap were reviewed. In 41 cases there was both a detailed letter from the parents and an independent review by a senior obstetrician. The reviewer's main criticisms were of inadequate fetal heart monitoring, lack of involvement of senior staff and inadequate records. The fetal heart trace was missing in 7 cases and over half of the remaining 34 traces available were misinterpreted or not acted on. In 17 cases junior doctors failed to recognize fetal distress and managed a delivery that they did not have the experience to deal with. In a further 6 cases, senior staff were called but did not come. Records were criticized for being incomplete, illegible or missing. In a few cases unjustified alterations appeared to have been made. Women reported that on some occasions staff ignored their worries, were unsympathetic and gave too little information. Some parents also experienced considerable difficulty in obtaining a clear explanation of the nature and cause of their child's condition. 
Effect of dietary menhaden oil on normal growth and development and on ameliorating mucosal injury in rats. We evaluated the effects of menhaden oil on growth and development of the small intestinal mucosa in growing rats and on the progression and resolution of methotrexate-induced mucosal injury in the rats. One study compared effects of diets containing 10% safflower oil(SO), 9% SO and 1% menhaden oil (MO), 10% MO, or 9% MO and 1% SO on mucosal growth and development for 125 d. In another study, animals fed the 10% MO or the 10% SO diet for 5 wk were subjected to subcutaneous methotrexate injections for 3 consecutive days. Feeding rats a diet containing large amounts of menhaden oil resulted in lower prostaglandin E2 and leukotriene B4 synthesis and lower sucrase activities. Indicators of mucosal mass after methotrexate-induced injury were significantly improved in both the jejunum and ileum at 3 and 10 d after methotrexate administration. Our data suggest that dietary menhaden oil stimulates mucosal regeneration after methotrexate-induced injury. 
Surgical collars: a survey of their prescription and use. We report the results of a questionnaire survey of 124 orthopaedic, rheumatology, medical and accident and emergency outpatients prescribed a surgical collar during a 3-month period. Of these, 99 (80%) returned the questionnaire. Instructions received about when to wear the collar differed widely, especially between specialties. Most patients (76%) found benefit in wearing the collar. Pain was the symptom helped most (78%) whilst dizziness was helped least (40%). Problems with the collars were common, many being too hot (69%) and uncomfortable (48%). A third had difficulty putting the collar on. Despite these problems, compliance was good with 19 patients discontinuing collars for reasons other than recovery or medical advice. We believe this study highlights further areas for research and stimulates a re-evaluation of collar usage. 
Usefulness of severity of myocardial ischemia on exercise testing in predicting the severity of myocardial ischemia during daily activities. To determine the relation between myocardial ischemic indexes on exercise testing and on ambulatory Holter recording, 60 patients with stable coronary artery disease who exhibited an ischemic response to both testing procedures were studied. All patients performed a Bruce protocol exercise test and underwent 24-hour Holter recording within 2 weeks without antianginal medications. Mean exercise duration was 7.4 +/- 2.8 minutes, mean heart rate at 1-mm ST depression was 118 +/- 20 beats/min and mean maximal ST depression during exercise was 2.2 +/- 1 mm. During Holter recording the average number of ischemic episodes was 4.7 +/- 2.6 per patient, mean duration of daily ischemia was 62 +/- 54 minutes, mean maximal ST depression was 3.2 +/- 1.3 mm and average heart rate at 1-mm ST depression was 93 +/- 17 beats/min. Overall, the correlations between ischemic indexes on both testing procedures were very weak (mean r2 = 0.054). The only exercise variable that had a significant correlation (p less than 0.05) with all Holter variables was heart rate at 1-mm ST depression, yet it correlated very weakly (0.064 less than or equal to r2 less than or equal to 0.125) with most Holter covariates and had a better correlation (r2 = 0.256) only with average heart rate at 1-mm ST depression during Holter. Thus, ischemic indexes on exercise testing cannot accurately predict ischemic indexes on ambulatory Holter recording in patients with stable coronary artery disease who exhibit ischemic changes on both tests. 
A molecular genetic study of factor XI deficiency. Factor XI deficiency is a rare bleeding diathesis found predominantly in Ashkenazi Jewish kindreds. A recent study of six Jewish patients identified three distinct mutations (Types I, II, and III) in the factor XI gene that were sufficient to fully define the genotypes of the patients. We have investigated 63 patients with factor XI deficiency and find overall allele frequencies of 44% for the type II mutation, 31% for the type III mutation, and 0% for the type I mutation. Therefore, 25% of the mutant factor XI alleles in our sample remain undefined. However, the distribution of mutant alleles is significantly different between Jewish and non-Jewish populations with hitherto undefined mutations accounting for 84% of the disease alleles in non-Jewish patients. Plasma factor XI:C levels were found to differ significantly between different homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes and the inheritance of the II/III genotype was found to carry an increased risk of the most severe bleeding tendency. 
Surgical treatment and prevention of vasculopathic impotence in conjunction with revascularisation of the lower extremities in Leriche's syndrome. The results are presented of combined revascularization of the lower extremities and the penis in 29 patients with Leriche's syndrome. This was effected by placing an autogenous venous shunt between the branch of a prosthesis or the common femoral artery and one of the dorsal arteries of the penis. Preoperatively lost sexual function was restored in 6 patients, while in 16 the sexual function was maintained at the preoperative level or improved in the late postoperative period. A comparison of the results obtained with the sexual performance of patients who had undergone bifurcated aortofemoral shunting only, prompted the conclusion that this surgical procedure was effective in the prevention and treatment of vasculopathic impotence in Leriche's syndrome. 
Flecainide in the treatment of fetal tachycardias. Fourteen mothers were treated with flecainide for fetal atrial tachycardias associated with intrauterine cardiac failure. Twelve of the 14 fetuses responded by conversion to sinus rhythm. One of the 12 fetuses subsequently died in utero. The remaining fetuses suffered no morbidity and were alive and well 3 months to 2 years after delivery. The two fetuses in whom atrial tachycardia did not convert with flecainide were successfully treated with digoxin. These results compare favourably with previous forms of antiarrhythmic treatment. After recent reports of the side effects of flecainide treatment, however, it has been advised that this drug should be confined to high risk patients and those with life threatening arrhythmias. The use of flecainide for fetal arrhythmias should be limited to patients with severe fetal hydrops and supraventricular tachycardias. It should not be the first drug of choice in atrial flutter. 
Life-sustaining therapy. A model for appropriate use New strategies are needed to curb the proliferation of life-sustaining therapies that rarely benefit patients. We propose a model for appropriate use of such therapies that incorporates effectiveness, utility, and marginal costs. If a therapy is rarely effective and rarely desirable, it is considered medically inappropriate. If the marginal cost-effectiveness ratio is inordinately high, it is considered economically inappropriate. If a therapy is either medically or economically inappropriate, it should not be automatically offered. The model provides an operational definition of futility and is illustrated with an analysis of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation for chronically ill older people. Advance directives, explicit health care rationing, and defining futile therapy based on survival predictions are alternatives to the appropriate care model, but are insufficient strategies to solve the problem of inappropriate life-sustaining care. 
Serial antiarrhythmic drug treatment to maintain sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion for chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The sequential use of different types of antiarrhythmic drugs may improve arrhythmia prognosis in chronic atrial fibrillation or flutter after successful electrical cardioversion. The rationale for serial treatment is that the arrhythmogenic mechanism may vary between patients, leading to different responses to 1 specific drug. To investigate this issue prospectively, 127 patients having chronic fibrillation or flutter exclusively, underwent serial drug treatment with flecainide (stage I) followed by sotalol or, if contraindicated, quinidine (stage II) and eventually amiodarone (stage III). Stages II and III were entered after electrical recardioversion for a recurrence during stages I or II, respectively. Calculated on an actuarial basis, the 2-year cumulative percentage of patients free of the arrhythmia increased from 31% after stage I to 63% at the end of serial treatment. To reach this result, a mean of 1.8 +/- 0.8 cardioversions per patient were needed, with 53 patients progressing to stage II and 34 to stage III. Sixteen patients stopped serial treatment prematurely and 15 patients were considered to have intractable atrial fibrillation at the end of stage III. Incidence of proarrhythmia was low. Multivariate analysis disclosed that an older age, in combination with a large number of previous episodes of arrhythmia, a long previous duration of arrhythmia and presence of mitral valve disease, were predictive for medical refractoriness during serial treatment. It is concluded that serial treatment may improve arrhythmia prognosis in atrial fibrillation or flutter, with an acceptable incidence of proarrhythmic events. 
Binding of kidney bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) isolectins to differentiated human colon carcinoma Caco-2 cells and their effect on cellular metabolism. The binding of Phaseolus vulgaris (PHA) isolectins L4 and E4 to the brush border membrane of differentiated Caco-2 cells was studied and the impact on cellular metabolism and microvilli was assessed. Computer analysis of the data based on binding experiments with peroxidase conjugated isolectins gave mean (SD) values for maximal binding of 2540 (151).10(-9) M for PHA-L4 and 2104 (140).10(-9) M for PHA-E4 per mg of brush border membrane protein. The dissociation constants for L4 and E4 binding were 4.3 (1.4).10(-6) M and 1.1 (0.8).10(-6) M, respectively. Incubation of differentiated Caco-2 cells for 30 minutes with ferritin conjugated PHA isolectins showed that, as indicated by the number of ferritin particles, PHA-E4 bound to the microvilli to a greater extent than PHA-L4. Ferritin particles were also localised intracellularly over endocytotic invaginations and vesicles. After incubation for 48 hours with PHA-L4 or PHA-E4, the relative incorporation of precursors for DNA, RNA, and (glyco)protein synthesis into the trichloroacetic acid insoluble fraction of the Caco-2 cells was determined. Both isolectins stimulated the incorporation of thymidine and glucosamine, but neither PHA-L4 nor PHA-E4 were able to influence the incorporation of uridine. With respect to fucose, methionine, and N-acetyl mannosamine, the stimulatory effect remained confined to PHA-E4. Since PHA-L4 and PHA-E4 were tested at the same concentrations, PHA-E4 is more effective than PHA-L4. The changes in the uptake of radioactive precursors were lost after heat inactivation of PHA-E4. Compared with control and PHA-L4 incubated Caco-2 cells, the microvilli of PHA-E4 incubated cells were shortened significantly (p less than 0.01). 
Linear lupus erythematosus profundus in a child. A 9-year-old Japanese boy had a 6-year history of a linear eruption of the left leg. It was characterized histopathologically by an intense lymphocytic panniculitis, perivascular and periappendageal infiltrates of lymphocytes, and vacuolization of the basal cell layer. This case represents a clinical presentation of linear lupus erythematosus profundus not previously reported. 
Transureteroureterostomy with cutaneous ureterostomy: a 25-year experience. We reviewed 67 patients who underwent transureteroureterostomy with cutaneous ureterostomy for benign (32) and malignant (35) disease in regard to the indications for and complications of the procedure. The most common complications included urine leakage at the ureteroureterostomy, stomal stenosis and calculus formation. Renal function improved or remained stable in 75% of the patients. Transureteroureterostomy with cutaneous ureterostomy is a viable alternative diversion technique in a select group of patients. 
Unruptured intracranial aneurysms: seizures and antiepileptic drug treatment following surgery. Twenty-one patients operated on for unruptured intracranial aneurysms were studied retrospectively in order to identify the incidence of postoperative seizures, factors predictive of seizures, and the response to discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs. The overall risk of postoperative seizures in initially seizure-free patients was 15.7%. Although seizures were not uncommon, antiepileptic drugs were successfully tapered in most of the patients before 12 months. 
Fatigue and depression in brain-injured patients correlated with quadriceps strength and endurance. Many brain-injured (BI) patients complain of persistent fatigue that may alter their lifestyles. In order to assess muscular strength and endurance after brain injury, 22 BI men, greater than 9 months postinjury and aged 20 to 51 years, were separated into two groups based on a complaint of fatigue (fatigue n = 13, nonfatigue n = 9); each performed one maximal isometric knee extension at 60 degrees and 20 maximal isokinetic contractions at 20 rpm using a Cybex II dynamometer. A third group of age-matched, able-bodied men (n = 10) were used as controls. A battery of tests assessing the presence of fatigue (using a symptom checklist and two rating scales), depression, anxiety, and health status were given at the time of isokinetic/isometric testing. The mean fatigue rating, a subjective score, for the fatigue group of BI subjects was significantly worse than the other groups (p less than .01). There was a positive correlation between clinically significant Zung depression scores and fatigue rating (r = .46) and between Zung anxiety scores and fatigue rating. The depression scores for those who complained of fatigue were significantly higher than the other groups (p less than .005). Maximal isometric contractions were no different among the three groups. The mean maximal isokinetic torque during the 20 repetitions was greater in controls than in the BI groups, but did not reach statistical significance (p less than .25). There were no significant declines in isokinetic torque in the 20 repetitions for any of the groups, and the fatigue index was nearly equal for all three groups. 
Repairs of the rotator cuff. Correlation of functional results with integrity of the cuff. We evaluated the results of 105 operative repairs of tears of the rotator cuff of the shoulder in eighty-nine patients at an average of five years postoperatively. We correlated the functional result with the integrity of the cuff, as determined by ultrasonography. Eighty per cent of the repairs of a tear involving only the supraspinatus tendon were intact at the time of the most recent follow-up, while more than 50 per cent of the repairs of a tear involving more than the supraspinatus tendon had a recurrent defect. Older patients and patients in whom a larger tear had been repaired had a greater prevalence of recurrent defects. At the time of the most recent follow-up, most of the patients were more comfortable and were satisfied with the result of the repair, even when they had sonographic evidence of a recurrent defect. The shoulders in which the repaired cuff was intact at the time of follow-up had better function during activities of daily living and a better range of active flexion (129 +/- 20 degrees compared with 71 +/- 41 degrees) compared with the shoulders that had a large recurrent defect. Similar correlations were noted for the range of active external and internal rotation and for strength of flexion, abduction, and internal rotation. In the shoulders in which the cuff was not intact, the degree of functional loss was related to the size of the recurrent defect. 
Cocaine and chest pain: clinical features and outcome of patients hospitalized to rule out myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, electrocardiographic findings, and hospital course in patients admitted with acute chest pain temporally related to cocaine use. DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. SETTING: A 485-bed county hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and one consecutive patients with cocaine-related chest pain admitted to the hospital to rule out myocardial infarction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The quality of the chest pain frequently suggested myocardial ischemia. Dyspnea was common (56%). The onset of chest pain occurred during cocaine use in 21% of patients, within 1 hour of use in 37%, and after 1 hour of use in 42%. Admission electrocardiographic findings were interpreted as normal in 32% of patients; as acute myocardial injury in 8%; as early repolarization variant in 32%; as left ventricular hypertrophy in 16%; and as "other" in 12%. Forty-three percent of patients had ST-segment elevation meeting the electrocardiographic criteria for use of thrombolytic therapy, but such elevation was usually due to the early repolarization variant. The initial total creatine kinase was elevated more than 3.3 mu kat/L (200 U/L) in 43% of patients, and an elevated total creatine kinase was recorded at some time during the hospital course in 47% of patients. The creatine kinase MB fraction was less than 0.02 in all patients. Myocardial infarction was ruled out in all patients. No patient experienced in-hospital cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSION: The quality of acute chest pain related to cocaine use is indistinguishable from that experienced in acute myocardial ischemia. Abnormal or normal variant electrocardiographic findings are common in patients with chest pain related to cocaine use, but nevertheless the incidence of acute myocardial infarction is low. The ST-segment and T-wave changes can mimic acute myocardial injury and are most likely normal findings in young black men that can be readily recognized in the emergency department. Most of these patients do not require admission to an intensive care unit. 
Leiomyosarcoma of renal vein. Leiomyosarcomas arising from the renal vein are rare tumors: only 13 cases are found in the literature. We report a case in a sixty-one-year-old woman who presented with back pain and hematuria. She underwent resection of the tumor and an ipsilateral nephrectomy. The tumor recurred locally, and the patient died thirty months after diagnosis. Review of the cases reported in the literature reveals the aggressive nature of these tumors and the need for a combined therapeutic approach. 
Administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) results in increased plasma concentrations of IL-5 and eosinophilia in patients with cancer. Peripheral eosinophilia is almost invariably observed during the course of interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy and is frequently accompanied by the development of a capillary leak syndrome characterized by edema, weight gain, and oliguria. We studied five patients with advanced malignancy treated with IL-2. Eosinophilia was not present initially but developed in all patients late in the course of therapy, with counts ranging from 2,328/mm3 to 15,958/mm3. In all patients, there was a temporal relationship between the infusion of IL-2 and the appearance of elevated plasma concentrations of IL-5, a growth factor for eosinophils. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor was not detectable in plasma. IL-4 and gamma-interferon plasma levels were variably elevated. Plasma concentrations of major basic protein, a toxic eosinophil granule protein, began increasing before eosinophil counts increased. By the time of the third IL-2 infusion, high concentrations of major basic protein were present in all five patients (up to 5,600 ng/mL) and skin biopsies showed major basic protein deposition in the dermis. Four patients developed significant capillary leak syndrome and all of these patients showed markedly elevated major basic protein levels. The lowest peak plasma concentration of major basic protein (1,751 ng/mL) was observed in the one patient who did not develop edema and weight gain. These results suggest that IL-2 induces IL-5 leading to marked peripheral eosinophilia and extravascular eosinophil degranulation. The release of toxic eosinophil products at extravascular sites and in the circulation may contribute to the pathogenesis of the capillary leak syndrome complicating IL-2 therapy. 
Dramatic response of follicular thyroid carcinoma with superior vena cava syndrome and tracheal obstruction to external-beam radiotherapy. We report a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma progressing to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and tracheal obstruction despite multiple doses of radioactive iodine therapy but subsequently responding dramatically to external-beam radiotherapy (RT). Although RT is not considered to be the treatment of choice for follicular carcinoma, RT in our patient produced unequivocal improvement of SVC syndrome and tracheal obstruction. 
Radiation associated malignant pleural mesothelioma. Malignant pleural mesothelioma of epithelial type developed in a 24 year old woman, 20 years after radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease. This case and a review of published cases indicate that radiation may induce malignant mesothelioma. 
The muscle flap in the treatment of chronic lower extremity osteomyelitis: results in patients over 5 years after treatment. Preliminary reports have indicated that debridement of the bony sequestrum followed by muscle-flap coverage allows successful treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. To determine the long-term effectiveness of this procedure, 34 consecutive patients with chronic osteomyelitis of the distal lower extremity treated with debridement, a 10- to 14-day course of culture-specific antibiotics, and immediate muscle-flap coverage were evaluated. Patients were treated from 1979 through 1984, and long-term (greater than 5 years) follow-up was available for 27 (79 percent). Twenty-three (85 percent) of these patients underwent microvascular muscle transplantation (gracilis or latissimus dorsi), and four underwent local muscle flaps (gastrocnemius or soleus) for immediate wound coverage. Twenty-four patients (89 percent) healed and were without recurrence over long-term (greater than 5 years, mean 7.4 years) follow-up. Of the three with recurrence, two were cured (greater than 5 years follow-up) after additional muscle-flap procedures. Thus the overall success rate was 96 percent, with a minimum 5-year follow-up. Guidelines for muscle-flap selection and treatment techniques in current use are presented. Debridement and immediate muscle-flap coverage provide effective, single-stage treatment of chronic osteomyelitic wounds and allow antibiotics to be restricted to short-term use. Furthermore, muscle flaps covered with skin grafts provide durable coverage while allowing subsequent ancillary procedures (i.e., bone grafts) to be performed under the flaps. 
Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome: findings on chest radiographs in 18 patients. Findings on chest radiographs of 18 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome were compared and correlated with peak eosinophil counts. Nine patients had normal chest radiographs. Of the nine patients with abnormal chest radiographs, three had fine, irregular linear opacities in the lungs (the opacities were most noticeable at the bases); three had similar irregular linear opacities and pleural effusions; and three had pleural effusions and confluent opacities. One patient demonstrated an enlarged heart; no pulmonary edema was seen in this patient or in any others. Although the mean recorded eosinophil cell counts were higher in those patients with abnormal chest radiographs (6,340 vs 5,454/mm3 [6.3 vs 5.4 x 10(9)/L]), the difference was not statistically significant. 
gamma-Hydroxybutyrate: a health-food product producing coma and seizurelike activity. Sixteen cases of adverse effects due to a new health-food product, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), were reported to the San Francisco Bay Area Regional Poison Control Center in the 5-month period from June to October 1990. Cases have also been reported in eight other states. Adverse effects included coma (four patients) and tonic-clonic seizurelike activity (two patients). Doses ranged from 1/4 teaspoon to 4 tablespoons. Acute symptoms resolved within 7 hours. GHB was investigated as an anesthetic agent during the 1960s until seizures and lack of analgesia precluded its use. It was recently introduced in the health-food market as a food supplement for body builders with claims of anabolic effects by stimulating growth hormone release. GHB remains under investigational new drug status with the Food and Drug Administration and is illegal for over the counter sale. The Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services has prohibited further sale of this product in California as have health departments in Florida and South Carolina; however, new cases continue to be reported. Health professionals should be aware of the potential health hazards of GHB. 
Raynaud's phenomenon. An update. The pathogenesis of primary Raynaud's phenomenon remains an enigma. Most evidence favors a local abnormality in the digital arteries as opposed to an increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. The local fault may involve the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, which are most important in reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction. Cooling blood vessels increase the sensitivity of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors, increased levels of alpha 2-adrenergic receptors are present in primary Raynaud's disease, and patients show an increased sensitivity to alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists on finger blood flow. Serotonin has also been implicated, but the evidence is not compelling. In secondary Raynaud's phenomenon, vasospastic attacks can often be explained by a low arterial distending pressure, a thickened vessel wall, or absence of beta-adrenergic receptor activity. Diagnosis of primary Raynaud's disease relies on a typical history and normal physical examination, laboratory studies, and nailfold capillaroscopy. Finger systolic blood pressures during local cooling with ischemia may be helpful to document vasospastic attacks but does not distinguish primary from secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. The treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon is usually conservative. Pavlovian conditioning or biofeedback may be beneficial. When drug therapy is necessary, the calcium channel entry blocker nifedipine or sympatholytic agents have been shown to decrease the frequency and duration of vasospastic attacks in about two thirds of patients, although subjective improvement does not usually correlate with objective testing. Direct-acting vasodilators have not been shown to be of definite benefit. New therapies include prostaglandins, captopril, and the serotonergic antagonist ketanserin. Surgical sympathectomy has not been beneficial. 
Stereographic and stereometric study of sebaceous gland hyperplasia in rabbit pinnas induced by topically applied substances. Tetradecane (TD), testosterone (TS), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were separately inuncted on rabbit pinnas once a day; the pinnas were biopsied on days 1, 3, 7, and 28. Untreated pinnas and squalane-treated pinnas were used as controls. Three-dimensional images of sebaceous glands were reconstructed from their serial histologic sections using a computer-image analysis system. By stereometry, the sebaceous gland volumes gradually increased during the course of treatments with TS and DMSO, whereas the volumes of TD-treated sebaceous glands increased, reached the maximum on day 7, and then decreased. The acinus number was increased by all the substances, the DMSO-treated sebaceous glands on day 28 showing the largest number of acini. The volumes of individual acini increased until day 28 with TS treatment, whereas with TD and DMSO treatments they increased, reached the maximum on day 7, and then decreased. Stereographically, each untreated control sebaceous gland was composed of 20-30 pear-shaped acini. On day 28, acini of TS-treated sebaceous glands were swollen and ovoid in shape, DMSO-treated sebaceous glands resembled a bunch of grapes, and acini of TD-treated sebaceous glands were widely scattered and showed globular swelling arising from an elongated tube. Hyperplastic responses of sebaceous glands are quite different according to substances applied topically. 
Symptom reporting in wanted and unwanted pregnancies. This study examined the association between unwanted pregnancy and the reporting of pregnancy symptoms in a sample of 99 pregnant women drawn from an urban, medical school based family practice residency. Of these women, 51 had unwanted pregnancies, and 48 had wanted pregnancies. Women with wanted pregnancies were more likely than women with unwanted pregnancies to report three pregnancy symptoms (amenorrhea, breast tenderness, and morning sickness). This association of symptoms with a wanted pregnancy persisted after controlling for age, race, marital status, contraceptive use, menstrual irregularity, and days since last menses through multiple logistic regression. Findings suggest that symptoms may be underreported by women with unwanted pregnancies. 
Ethanol-induced gastric injury. Role of submucosal venoconstriction and leukotrienes. Under in vivo microscopic observation, intragastric ethanol instillation has been seen to cause a prompt, marked constriction of submucosal venules, followed by congestion in mucosal capillaries and severe gross mucosal lesion formation. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that the venoconstriction is mediated by leukotrienes and that inhibition of the venoconstriction would protect against ethanol injury. Intragastric application of the leukotriene receptor antagonist MK-571 inhibited both venoconstriction and gross lesion formation. However, although local submucosal application of MK-571 inhibited venoconstriction, it did not protect the overlying gastric mucosa against ethanol injury. We conclude that leukotrienes play a significant pathogenetic role in ethanol-induced gastric mucosal injury, but while the venoconstriction, mediated by leukotrienes, is one of the factors that promote lesion formation, it is not an essential one. 
Non-acid mechanisms of gastric and duodenal ulcer formation. The pathophysiology of gastric and duodenal ulcer disease has two sides: the aggressive attack, principally by the highly corrosive gastric acid; and the defending forces of mucus, mucosal resistance, and other protective substances and functions. This report reviews the roles of both the attacking and defending forces in the pathophysiology of ulcer disease. It also discusses how an early notion of ulcer formation (e.g., the Schwarz dictum of "no acid, no ulcer," first published in 1910) became the slogan by which ulcer disease was understood and from which therapy took its cue. Subsequent work has since found that the Schwarz dictum holds for duodenal ulcer, but not for gastric ulcer. Non-acid mechanisms of ulcer formation--i.e., impairment of at least one of the defending or protective forces--are also described, as are treatment approaches to ulcer disease. Although suppression of acid secretion is a mainstay of treatment, agents that safely and effectively strengthen the defense are being used more frequently. There are signs that the safe limits for acid-suppressing therapy have been reached or passed. On the other hand, the search for therapy that strengthens the defensive factors has only begun. 
Chimeric gamma-delta signal joints. Implications for the mechanism and regulation of T cell receptor gene rearrangement. Rearrangement of Ag receptor genes requires recognition by the lymphocyte recombinase of heptamer-nonamer signal sequences followed by two endonucleolytic cleavages and two DNA ligations to form the coding and signal joints. The phenomenon of trans-rearrangement, in which Ag receptor gene segments located on different chromosomes recombine to yield chimeric products, provides an in vivo system in which to investigate the ability of the recombinase to carry out each of these functions in trans. Trans-rearrangements between TCRG and TCRD loci, similar in structure and frequency to those observed previously in human lymphoid tissues, were demonstrated in normal mouse thymus by PCR with crossed V gamma/J delta and V delta/J gamma primer pairs. A simple mechanistic model for trans-rearrangement was then tested. This model posits an ability of the recombinase to catalyze the formation of both coding and signal joints in trans and therefore predicts that trans-rearrangements will generate chimeric signal joints. In adult thymus, chimeric D delta 2-J gamma 1 and D delta 2-J gamma 2 signal joints, containing fused heptamer-nonamer sequences, could be detected by PCR and were each present at frequencies sufficient to account for a large proportion of the corresponding TCRG/TCRD trans-rearrangements. In agreement with the predictions of the model, chimeric signal joints were found as both linear chromosomal and circular episomal DNA. The results provide a framework for understanding the formation of chromosomal translocations in normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells and support the possibility of a looping mechanism for standard gene rearrangement. To test the form of regulation of TCRG rearrangement, the frequencies of specific signal joints from standard and trans-rearrangements were compared. Although J gamma 1 and J gamma 2 segments participated with equal frequency in trans-rearrangement with D delta 2, only the J gamma 1 segment participated in standard rearrangement with V gamma 5. The results suggest that V-J recombination in the TCRG locus is regulated directly at the DNA level by cis-acting constraints which do not affect the accessibility of individual TCRG gene segments to recombination in trans. 
Otorhinolaryngologic causes of headache. Pain around the face and neck is common. This pain may be referred from a different area. Because patients usually present with pain and discomfort in a specific location such as the ear, nose, face, throat, or neck, this article discusses separately the innervation of each region and the most frequent causes of pain in each of these areas. 
Effect of recombinant alpha 2 interferon with or without prednisone in Chinese HBsAg carrier children. Ninety Chinese hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier children, aged 2-17 years, positive for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and hepatitis B virus DNA on at least three occasions in 6 months, were randomized into 3 groups. Thirty children received syrup vitamin B complex as control, 29 received 6 weeks of placebo syrup followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon [intron A (rIFN2b)], 5 x 10(6) u/m2 subcutaneously thrice weekly; and 31 received 6 weeks of syrup prednisone (0.6 mg/kg tailed to 0.2 mg/kg) followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon as above. The placebo/prednisone syrup was given on a double-blind basis. At 24 months of follow-up, persistent loss of hepatitis B virus DNA occurred in none of the children in the control group, in one child receiving recombinant alpha 2b-interferon alone, who also seroconverted to anti-HBe and anti-HBs and in five children receiving interferon with steroid priming (p = 0.0571 compared with controls), with four seroconverting to anti-HBe and one also seroconverting to anti-HBs. A rise of transaminases to above twice the upper limit of normal levels during the first 7 months of follow-up occurred in one subject in the control group, four in the group receiving alpha 2b-interferon alone and nine in the group receiving recombinant alpha 2b-interferon with steroid priming (p = 0.0144 compared with controls). Side effects of the steroid were negligible; those of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon were transient and acceptable. We conclude that 6 weeks of prednisone followed by 16 weeks of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon is of use in inducing persistent loss of hepatitis B virus DNA (16.1 per cent) and e-seroconversion (12.9 per cent) in a proportion of Chinese HBsAg carrier children: the prednisone probably enhances the immunomodulatory effect of recombinant alpha 2b-interferon. 
Sarcoid neuropathy. In a case of subacute sensory and motor polyneuropathy associated with sarcoidosis, multiple epineurial and endoneurial granulomas were demonstrated in a sural nerve. Neighbouring nerve fibres were displaced by the granulomas and some were undergoing axonal degeneration. Ultrastructural and teased fibre studies showed axonal atrophy and degeneration with secondary demyelination. Histochemical studies indicated the presence of HLA-DR antigen on epithelioid cells in the granulomas. A non-specific inflammatory process in the nerve does not cause significant primary demyelination. 
The impact of tumor size on the efficacy of monoclonal antibody-targeted radiotherapy: studies using a nude mouse model with human renal cell carcinoma xenografts. Monoclonal antibody (Mab)-targeted radiotherapy is a unique approach in cancer therapy. Multiple factors affect the success of treatment. Internal radiation dosimetry and mini-dose Mab-targeted radiotherapy studies reveal that tumor size affects the efficacy of treatment. For tumors with calculated weight greater than 400 mg., intravenous administration of 131I-labeled A6H or A6H-C5H combination delivers significantly less tumor radiation dose (2070 +/- 580 cGy/100 microCi) than those for tumors of weight less than 200 mg. (5260 +/- 2460 cGy/100 microCi). In the mini-dose (an average of 73 to 86 microCi) Mab-targeted radiotherapy study of 109 mice with small tumors (six, 12, or 19 days after implantation), tumors 12 days after implantation (approximately 60 mg. in weight) showed regression in all mice and in 62% of mice gross tumor elimination was observed. In contrast, mini-dose therapy at day 19 (tumor weights approximately 170 mg.) resulted in tumor regression and tumor elimination rates of 33% and 17% respectively. These studies suggest that Mab-targeted radiotherapy is more suitable for treating small tumors. 
Repair of severe anterior vaginal wall prolapse (grade IV cystourethrocele). The classical approach for the repair of severe anterior vaginal wall prolapse is the use of transvaginal colporrhaphy or, more recently, an abdominal paravaginal repair. Severe cystoceles develop from weaknesses of the levator sling and pubocervical fasciae resulting in 2 main anatomical changes: a central defect between the pubocervical fasciae, and a sliding herniation of the bladder and urethra (paravaginal defect). We developed a new transvaginal technique for the repair of large cystoceles (grade IV) extending outside of the introitus at rest, which includes repair of the central defect by anterior colporrhaphy, and repair of the paravaginal herniation of the bladder base and bladder neck by a needle suspension of these structures. We report our experience within a 5-year period in the treatment of 51 cases of severe bladder prolapse (grade IV cystoceles), 46 of which required this combined procedure regardless of preoperative stress urinary incontinence status. Five patients underwent anterior colporrhaphy as the only procedure, since they were continent and demonstrated a well supported bladder neck from a previous suspension operation. Other vaginal abnormalities should be repaired simultaneously to provide adequate pelvic floor support. 
Composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysm of the ascending aorta: results in 100 patients. One hundred consecutive patients with the Marfan syndrome underwent composite graft repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm between September 1976 and June 1989. Twenty-two patients had ascending aortic dissection at the time of composite graft repair; 18 patients also had a mitral valve procedure. There were no hospital deaths among 92 patients undergoing elective repair. One of 8 patients undergoing emergency repair of a ruptured aneurysm died in the operating room. The overall hospital mortality rate was 1%. There have been ten late deaths among the 99 hospital survivors (10.1%). Five deaths occurred among the first 11 patients in this series and five occurred among the last 88 patients (5.7%). Three late deaths resulted from composite graft endocarditis; 3 other patients with endocarditis are alive after aortic root replacement with cryopreserved homografts. Late coronary dehiscence caused death in 1 patient and was successfully repaired in a second. Actuarial survival for the 100 patients was 92.6% at 5 years and 75.8% at 10 years. Currently, composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysms of the ascending aorta can be performed with low hospital and late mortality. Marfan aneurysms with a diameter of 6 cm or greater should be repaired with the Bentall composite graft procedure, even if the patient is asymptomatic. 
Value and limitations of secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene. Secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts are widely regarded to be of questionable value. This has prompted some to abandon all attempts at secondary revascularization with PTFE and others to recommend that primary femoropopliteal bypasses be performed preferentially with PTFE grafts so that vein may be used for secondary procedures. Because we questioned both of these views, we reviewed all femoropopliteal bypasses done at our institution in the past 12 years and identified 73 secondary PTFE femoropopliteal procedures performed after a failed ipsilateral infrainguinal bypass (69 failed femoropopliteal; 4 failed femorodistal). Seventy (96%) secondary bypasses were performed for limb salvage and 3 (4%) for severe disabling claudication. Insertion of grafts to the popliteal artery was above the knee in 26 (36%) and below the knee in 47 (64%). Primary life-table graft patency at 4 years was only 38%. Forty-eight reinterventions in 34 limbs were required to restore or maintain graft patency in thrombosed or failing grafts. For thrombosed grafts, 20 interventions consisted of 9 simple thrombectomies and 11 thrombectomies with additional revision procedures (5 distal or proximal extensions, 6 patch angioplasties). Twenty-eight lesions threatening graft patency were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3, proximal or distal extensions in 20, and patch angioplasty in 5. As a result of these reinterventions, the overall secondary patency rate was 55% at 4 years, and the limb salvage rate was 74% at 4 years. Although aggressive follow-up and reintervention may be required, the use of secondary PTFE conduits in the femoropopliteal position is a viable option in patients undergoing limb salvage procedures who are at high risk. 
Microorganisms and diarrhea in enterally fed intensive care unit patients. Thirty-six intensive care unit patients, receiving aseptic or manually (routine) reconstituted enteral feeding formulas, were evaluated prospectively for the relationship of microbial involvement, gastric pH, and antimicrobial therapy to diarrhea. The routine protocol group had a significantly higher incidence of bacterial contamination than the aseptic protocol group (Fisher's exact test, p less than 0.05). There were no significant direct associations between isolate category (Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative cocci, yeast), gastric pH, or antimicrobials and diarrhea. However, two organisms (Group D Enterococci and yeast) were indirectly implicated in some cases of diarrhea. 
Subcellular characteristics of phospholipase A2 activity in the rat kidney. Enhanced cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal phospholipase A2 enzymatic activity after renal ischemia and reperfusion. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activities in cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal fractions of rat kidneys were characterized under control conditions, after ischemia, and subsequent to ischemia and reperfusion. Two forms of PLA2 activity were present in the cytosolic fraction: a high molecular weight form, active against phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which upon purification has a molecular mass of 110 kD; and smaller form (Mr approximately 14 kD), active against PE. In mitochondrial and microsomal fractions a single form (Mr approximately 14 kD), active against both PC and PE, was dominant. Activities in each fraction were optimal at pH 8.5-9.5. Cytosolic PLA2 activity was enhanced when Ca2+ concentration [( Ca2+]) was increased over the range of 10(-7) to 10(-6) M. Mitochondrial PLA2 activity required higher [Ca2+] for activation (greater than 10(-6) M). After 45 min of ischemia cytosolic PLA2 activity was decreased, whereas mitochondrial and microsomal activities were increased. When ischemia was followed by 1 h of reperfusion, cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal activities were enhanced. Ischemia alone did not change the gel filtration chromatography patterns of PLA2 activity, but ischemia and reperfusion resulted in the appearance of a new peak of activity in cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions (Mr approximately 2-3 kD). Thus, the rat kidney has multiple forms of PLA2 activity, likely representing distinct enzymes, with Ca2+ dependencies suggesting regulation by Ca2+ in vivo. Ischemia and reperfusion result in stable increases of PLA2 activity in each subcellular fraction, perhaps related to covalent modifications of PLA2's, which likely account for membrane phospholipid degradation, and increased tissue levels of unsaturated free fatty acids. 
Polytetrafluoroethylene vs. polypropylene suture for endoscopic bladder neck suspension. Between May 1989 and October 1989, 24 women underwent a prospective, randomized study comparing polypropylene (Prolene) and polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) sutures for endoscopic bladder neck suspension. Polypropylene was associated with significantly more suture pain than polytetrafluoroethylene. Polytetrafluoroethylene was more difficult to tie at a predetermined tension. 
Diltiazem administration after crystalloid resuscitation restores active hepatocellular function and hepatic blood flow after severe hemorrhagic shock. Studies have shown that active hepatocellular function is depressed after hemorrhagic shock, despite crystalloid resuscitation. It is also known that calcium antagonists produce various beneficial effects on cell and organ function after ischemia and shock. However, it remains unknown whether such agents have any salutary effects on the depressed active hepatocellular function and hepatic blood flow in a nonheparinized model of trauma and hemorrhage. To study this, rats underwent a midline laparotomy (trauma-induced) and were bled to and maintained at a mean arterial pressure of 40 mm Hg until 40% of the maximum bleedout was returned in the form of Ringer's lactate. They were then resuscitated with four times the volume of shed blood with Ringer's lactate over 60 minutes, during and after which diltiazem (400 micrograms/kg body weight) was infused intravenously over 95 minutes. Active hepatocellular function (Vmax and Km) was determined with an in vivo indocyanine green clearance technique. Effective hepatic blood flow (EHBF) was determined by Fick principle and corrected by the indocyanine green extraction ratio. Hepatic microvascular blood flow (HMBF) was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. Results indicate that Vmax, Km, EHBF, and HMBF decreased significantly at 1.5 and 4 hours after resuscitation. Diltiazem infusion restored the depressed Vmax, Km, EHBF, and HMBF and prevented the occurrence of hepatic edema. Thus, diltiazem may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of trauma and severe hemorrhage even in the absence of blood resuscitation. 
Bradykinin-stimulated inositol phosphate production in NG108-15 cells is mediated by a small population of binding sites which rapidly desensitize. [3H]Bradykinin (BDK) binds to two distinct binding sites (P less than .01, N = 12) in NG108-15 cell membranes; (site 1: Kd1 = 3.09 x 10(-10) M, Bmax1 = 242 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein) and (site 2: Kd2 = 1.94 x 10(-8) M, Bmax2 = 491 +/- 75 fmol/mg protein). Although site 1 comprises only 33 +/- 4% (N = 12) of the total binding site population, comparison of the binding affinity and functional potency for BDK agonist analogs exhibiting differential selectivity for the two sites reveals that this high affinity site is the receptor mediating inositol monophosphate (IP) production in this cell line. BDK-stimulated IP production undergoes a very rapid (5 min) desensitization that is characterized by both a loss in agonist potency (EC50 = 3.57 x 10(-9) M vs. 1.94 x 10(-10) M in controls; P less than .001, N = 12) and a decrease in amplitude of response (fold stimulation = 1.45 +/- 0.06 vs. 1.80 +/- 0.09 in controls; P less than .01, N = 12). Only the decrease in response amplitude is attenuated by down-regulation of protein kinase C by prior long term treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), indicating an involvement of protein kinase C activation in the desensitization process. Desensitization is accompanied by down-regulation of site 1 only (Bmax1 = 71 +/- 8 fmol/mg (N = 10; P less than .001 vs. controls)); Bmax2 and the Kd for BDK at both sites remain unchanged, further supporting the contention that site 1 is the functionally relevant receptor. In contrast to the functional data, long term TPA treatment does not attenuate the receptor down-regulation, indicating that the rapid desensitization involves both receptor-related and postreceptor mechanisms. The implications of this property of the BDK receptor for analog design and receptor classification are discussed. 
Observations on the Kveim reaction using an animal model of granulomatous bowel disease. Striking differences were observed between the visceral and cutaneous responses after tests with validated Kveim and normal spleen suspensions in a guinea pig model of granulomatous bowel disease. Five of six animals sensitised with BCG showed positive responses at the ileal Kveim test site whereas all six had negative cutaneous Kveim tests. Conversely, two of six animals sensitised with irradiated Mycobacterium leprae showed positive cutaneous Kveim tests and only one a positive response in the ascending colon. All six showed negative responses at the ileal Kveim test site. No positive visceral or cutaneous responses were observed in either group of animals after tests with normal spleen suspension. These findings are discussed in relation to the positive Kveim responses previously reported among patients with Crohn's disease, tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy, and among seemingly healthy BCG vaccinated subjects. The findings provide further evidence in support of a possible mycobacterial aetiology for sarcoidosis and Crohn's disease. 
Effects of vascular runoff on myointimal hyperplasia after mechanical balloon or thermal laser arterial injury in dogs. BACKGROUND. Clinical evidence suggests that poor vascular runoff reduces the long-term success rate of femoral angioplasty procedures. The purpose of this experimental study was to examine myointimal hyperplasia of dog femoral arteries after balloon denudation, thermal laser arterial injury, or sham operation in normal and reduced vascular runoff conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Before mechanical balloon injury or transluminal heated laser probe motion, the peripheral vascular runoff of dogs was reduced by ligating the femoral artery below its three distal side branches, decreasing the femoral flow rate from 114 +/- 9 to 52 +/- 5 ml/min (mean +/- SEM). Endothelial denudation with a predominantly intact elastic internal membrane and circumferential structural changes in the media were noted by light microscopy 1 hour after balloon injury. Focal completely necrotic lesions of intima and media were found 1 hour after thermal laser arterial injury. After 8 weeks, the maximal thickness of neointima plus media of the site of previous intervention was greater after balloon injury (0.45 +/- 0.03 mm) and thermal laser injury (0.54 +/- 0.03 mm) than after sham operation (0.40 +/- 0.01 mm; p less than 0.001) in normal runoff dogs. Reduced vascular runoff augmented myointimal hyperplasia both in the balloon-injured and thermally damaged arteries; the wall thickness increased from 0.45 +/- 0.03 to 0.93 +/- 0.10 mm and from 0.54 +/- 0.03 to 0.65 +/- 0.05 mm, respectively (p less than 0.001). The neointimal and medial wall area of the balloon-injured arteries contributed 48% to the area encompassed by the external elastic membrane compared with an 81% portion when vascular runoff was reduced (p less than 0.01). A 47% neointimal and medial wall area was found in thermally injured arteries with normal runoff compared with 63% after runoff reduction (p less than 0.05). CONCLUSION. This study suggests that hemodynamic factors associated with poor vascular runoff play an important role in extending myointimal hyperplasia independent of method and severity of the arterial injury during angioplasty. 
Human papillomavirus--associated vulvar verrucous carcinoma in a 20-year-old with an intact hymen. A case report. A 20-year-old woman with vulvar verrucous carcinoma, the youngest such patient reported to date, had human papillomavirus DNA 6/11 identified with an in situ hybridization technique. In addition to her youth, the patient was unusual in that she had an intact hymen. Although she denied having engaged in sexual activity, venereal transmission of the virus may have occurred without vaginal penetration. 
DNA/RNA content and proliferative fractions of colorectal carcinomas: a five-year prospective study relating flow cytometry to survival. In our prospective study, flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA and RNA content was performed on unfixed fresh specimens of colorectal adenocarcinoma taken from 176 patients. Of the 176 tumors, 113 (64%) were aneuploid. There was no correlation between aneuploidy and tumor stage, grade, location, or size. After a median follow-up of 5.6 years, no correlation between DNA or RNA content and patient survival was found. DNA content alone was not an independent prognostic factor when the colorectal carcinomas were segregated by curable and incurable stages. However, normal mucosa, diploid tumors, and aneuploid tumors showed progressively higher proliferation and higher RNA and DNA indices. Proliferative fraction--defined as the percentage of cells in S + G2 and M phases of the cell cycle--was significantly related to ploidy and to Dukes' stage. Despite these correlations, we did not detect a significant influence of proliferative fraction on survival when patients were segregated above or below the mean proliferative fraction for all tumors. More accurate methods of identifying the proliferative fraction of tumor cells are currently being pursued. While the role of flow cytometry in the evaluation and management of patients with colorectal carcinoma is still undefined for a number of other cellular parameters, it seems unlikely that DNA index, RNA index, or the proliferative fractions calculated from the DNA histogram, will, of themselves, represent independent prognostic factors. 
Carotid endarterectomy in Great Britain and Ireland: trends and current practice. Of 309 questionnaires on carotid endarterectomy sent to all surgeons in Great Britain and Ireland who might use this technique, 298 (96 per cent) were returned. In all, 110 (37 per cent) of 298 surgeons performed at least one carotid endarterectomy in 1989; 67 performed less than 10 and 43 greater than 10. In total, these 110 surgeons performed 1417 operations in 1989, a situation that has changed little over 5 years since the previous survey. Transient ischaemic attack and minor stroke remain the main indications for carotid endarterectomy; the operation was hardly ever performed for asymptomatic stenosis. By 1989 almost all surgeons initially assessed prospective patients using a technique less invasive than conventional angiography; duplex scanning was used 'always' or 'sometimes' by 70 per cent of surgeons. While 72 per cent of surgeons in 1984 'always' required conventional angiograms before operation, by 1989 only 21 per cent did so, most now relying on less invasive techniques. During operation there was an increasing use of shunts, carotid sinus nerve blockade and patch closure of the arteriotomy. The overall number of carotid endarterectomies performed annually in Great Britain and Ireland has remained steady over the past 5 years and is relatively low for a population of 60 millions. An increase in the number of surgeons performing the operation is almost entirely accounted for by an increase in those performing less than 10 carotid endarterectomies per year. 
Transplantation of kidneys from pediatric cadaver donors to adult recipients. Pediatric donors (less than 12 years old) are a potentially important source of kidneys for adult recipients. Previous reports of decreased graft survival and increased complication rates have made surgeons wary of using such kidneys. In 64 kidneys from younger donors transplanted to adult recipients the delayed graft function rate (41 versus 42%), and 2 and 3-year graft survival rates (67 versus 72% and 61 versus 65%, respectively) were similar to those seen with kidneys from adult donors. Kidneys from donors 24 months old or less experienced an 80% rate of graft loss at 1 year. When these kidneys are excluded the 1-year graft survival rate was similar to kidneys from older and younger donors (70 versus 77%). Mean serum creatinine at 1 year was similar in both groups (155 +/- 21 versus 151 +/- 10). Pediatric kidneys except those obtained from donors 2 years old or less are suitable for adult recipients. However, kidneys from very young donors may be more appropriate to pediatric recipients. 
Use of social science research to improve epidemiologic studies of and interventions for diarrhea and dysentery. The significance of dysentery has not been recognized in community-based programs for the management of diarrhea. Culturally sensitive methods of classification and algorithms for treatment of these diseases must be developed. Considered in this article is the manner in which ethnographic studies of diarrhea can contribute to descriptive epidemiologic data on diarrhea and dysentery and to procedures of health education and evaluation of interventions for the diseases. Indigenous terms for bloody diarrhea exist in many cultures. Local use of such terms must be carefully examined before they are incorporated in health education efforts and epidemiologic surveillance programs. 
Pneumocephalus associated with benign brain tumor: report of two cases. Two cases of spontaneous pneumocephalus, which developed after ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedures for severe hydrocephalus caused by benign brain tumors, are reported. In both cases there was no previous history of cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Operation revealed that both patients had many small defects of the dura mater and the bone in the middle cranial fossa, which were plugged by necrotic brain tissue. These defects were remote from the sites of the original tumors but may have been produced by long-standing raised intracranial pressure, and they presumably allowed air to enter after intracranial pressure was reduced by shunting. Repair of the defects prevented further intracranial air retention. 
Activation of a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily by peroxisome proliferators We have cloned a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. The receptor homologue is activated by a diverse class of rodent hepatocarcinogens that causes proliferation of peroxisomes. Identification of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor should help elucidate the mechanism of the hypolipidaemic effect of these hepatocarcinogens and aid evaluation of their potential carcinogenic risk to man. 
Experimental evaluation of myocardial protective effect of prostacyclin analog (OP-41483) as an adjunct to cardioplegic solution. A stable prostacyclin analog (OP-41483) was evaluated for myocardial protective effect against global ischemia with the use of cardioplegia. Isolated canine hearts (n = 25) were exposed to 60 minutes of warm (37 degrees C) global ischemia after the arrest by crystalloid cardioplegia. Prostaglandin analog was given in three different ways: preadministration (700 ng/kg body weight per minute) before ischemia for 30 minutes (group I, n = 5), given as a component of cardioplegic solution (600 ng/ml, group II, n, = 6), and post-administration (25 ng/kg body weight per minute) during reperfusion for 30 minutes (group III, n = 7). During reperfusion, coronary sinus blood flow, 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha in coronary sinus blood, and myocardial oxygen consumption were measured during reperfusion. As a result, groups II and III showed significantly better global left ventricular function (developed pressure, maximum dP/dt, and diastolic compliance) than the control group (without prostaglandin analog, n = 7) and group I. Myocardial oxygen consumption at reperfusion (1 minute) was significantly larger in group II than in the control group. 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha flux was significantly larger in group II than in the other three groups during reperfusion. The results indicated that prostaglandin analog has a beneficial effect on myocardial protection under global ischemia with cardioplegia, particularly when used as a component of cardioplegic solution and also during reperfusion. The mechanism may relate to the cytoprotective effect (including protection of endothelium with enhanced endogenous prostacyclin production at reperfusion and also to the modulation of reperfusion per se. 
Cortical control of reflexive visually-guided saccades. Reflexive visually-guided saccade triggering may be facilitated or inhibited by the cerebral cortex. To study this control, saccades made towards suddenly appearing visual targets (saccade task) or away from them (antisaccade task) were recorded electro-oculographically in 45 patients with limited unilateral cerebral infarction. Lesions affected (1) the superior part of the angular gyrus (area 39 of Brodmann) in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), (2) the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) (area 46 of Brodmann), (3) the frontal eye field (FEF), or (4) the supplementary motor area (SMA). As these 4 types of lesions were located either in the right or the left cerebral hemisphere, patients were divided into 8 groups. Saccade latency, in the saccade task, and the percentage of errors (misdirected saccades made towards the visual target), in the antisaccade task, were compared in each group of patients with the values of 20 control subjects. In the saccade task, saccade latency was significantly increased bilaterally in the right PPC group. In the left PPC group, the increase in latency was less marked, and significant only for saccades made contralaterally to the lesion. In the different frontal groups, latency was unchanged or only slightly increased. These results confirm that the main area facilitating the triggering of reflexive visually-guided saccades is located in the PPC, in or near the superior part of the angular gyrus. The difference between right and left parietal lesions could be due to the predominance of the right hemisphere in the control of these saccades. In the antisaccade task, the percentage of errors was significantly increased bilaterally in both PFC groups compared with the control group and also to the FEF and SMA groups. These results suggest that the PFC is the main area in the cerebral hemisphere inhibiting reflexive visually-guided saccades. 
An autopsy study of the incidence of lacunes in relation to age, hypertension, and arteriosclerosis. We investigated selected features of lacunes in 1,086 necropsy cases. Lacunes were found in brains from patients above the age of 40 years and were most common in brains from persons in their sixties but decreased in number in brains from older persons. The most common site of lacunes was the frontal lobe white matter, followed by the putamen, pons, parietal lobe white matter, thalamus, and caudate nucleus in descending order of frequency. By dividing the 1,086 cases into three groups according to blood pressure, we found more lacunes in the hypertensive and borderline hypertensive groups than in the normotensive group; the average number of lacunes per brain in each group was 3.61, 2.77, and 1.15, respectively. Diastolic hypertension was more closely related to the number of lacunes than was systolic hypertension. The extent of arteriolosclerosis of the medullary arteries in the frontal lobe white matter was measured and compared with the number of lacunes. There was a close correlation between lacunes and arterioloslerosis in all age groups. 
Treatment of vasospasm with a 480-nm pulsed-dye laser. Laser energy at a wavelength of 480 nm was applied in 1-microseconds pulses of 3 to 10 mJ to two models of vasospasm. Rabbit common carotid arteries (CCA's) were constricted chronically by the application of human blood within a silicone sheath. Peak vasospasm developed 24 to 48 hours later, and persisted for up to 6 days. Endovascular laser treatment was delivered to 40 CCA's via a 200-microns diameter silica quartz fiber introduced through the femoral artery. The CCA caliber increased from 60% of the pre-vasospasm control diameter to a minimum post-laser diameter of 83% of control. No instances of laser-induced perforation or of arterial thrombosis were observed for up to 60 days after treatment. Prophylactic laser application to nine normal vessels was able to attenuate the development of vasospasm if blood was applied immediately thereafter (88% vs. 59% of control diameter, p less than 0.02), but not if blood was applied 7 days later. Studies in 16 normal CCA's established that there was a considerable margin between the laser energy required to induce dilatation and that which caused perforation, providing that the fiber remained relatively central within the artery. Morphological examination demonstrated focal loss of endothelial cells immediately after laser application, followed approximately 7 days later by the development of areas of intimal hyperplasia. Only minimal changes were observed in the medial or adventitial layers. In a second study, the basilar artery of seven dogs was constricted chronically by two intracisternal injections of autologous blood 3 days apart. Five dogs received endovascular laser treatment 7 or 10 days after the first injection, when basilar artery diameter was reduced to a mean of 61% and 77% of control, respectively. Immediately following treatment, basilar artery diameter increased to 104% and 102% of resting diameter, respectively. Both untreated and laser-treated arteries were smaller than the control diameter at 30 days (80% and 82%, respectively), but in each group the vasodilatory response to hypercapnia was preserved. These findings indicate that 1-microsecond laser pulses are well tolerated by systemic and cerebral arteries in two different animal models, and suggest that the 480-nm pulsed-dye laser may have an application for the treatment or prophylaxis of cerebral vasospasm. 
HBxAg in the liver from carrier patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 110 cases of chronic hepatitis and 108 cases of cirrhosis were stained for HBxAg by the avidin-biotin complex technique using specific antisera made against full-length HBxAg polypeptide or derived synthetic peptides. These tissues were also stained for the HBsAg and HBcAg by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method. Among patients with chronic hepatitis, 86% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 60% were surface antigen positive and 32% were core antigen positive. Among patients with cirrhosis, 97% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 72% were surface antigen positive and 17% were positive for core antigen. Staining specificity was demonstrated, in part, by using preimmune sera in the place of primary antibody, by blocking of the primary antibody with the appropriate antigen before assay and by testing uninfected liver controls. The persistence and high frequency of HBxAg in liver cells from patients with chronic liver disease suggest that it may play one or more important roles in the pathogenesis of chronic infection. It is possible that detection of HBxAg in the liver could be an additional new diagnostic marker for hepatitis B virus infection. However, the function(s) of HBxAg in the pathogenesis of the chronic liver disease, if any, remains to be explained. 
Pyomyositis in patients with the human immunodeficiency virus: an unusual form of disseminated bacterial infection. PURPOSE AND PATIENTS: Pyomyositis, a common disease in the tropics, is rare in the continental United States, with approximately 83 cases described in the literature in the past two decades. The occurrence of pyomyositis complicating human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has been reported in 10 patients since 1986. We report six cases of this entity in patients with advanced HIV disease seen in our institution over a 20-month period. A common denominator in all of our patients was muscle injury, induced by either exercise or trauma. Unlike most previous reports of HIV-associated pyomyositis, the clinical picture in our cases was complicated by the development of abscesses in multiple muscle groups, requiring prolonged antimicrobial therapy and repeated drainage procedures for successful management. Interestingly, one patient developed concomitant rhabdomyolysis--an otherwise rare event in classical pyomyositis. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant infecting organism in this as well as all other series. Of note, we also observed and report the first case, to our knowledge, of gram-negative pyomyositis in an HIV-infected individual. The pathogenic implications of this catalase-producing gram-negative isolate are discussed in the context of neutrophil abnormalities in HIV disease. CONCLUSION: Like tropical pyomyositis, its HIV-associated counterpart appears to be multifactorial in origin. Its recent recognition suggests that, in addition to underlying abnormalities of host defense, factors relating to the prolonged survival of patients with late-stage disease, including myopathy, might play an important contributory role. 
Propranolol in the prevention of the first hemorrhage from esophagogastric varices: A multicenter, randomized clinical trial. The Boston-New Haven-Barcelona Portal Hypertension Study Group. To assess the effectiveness of propranolol in the prevention of initial variceal hemorrhage, a double-blind, randomized trial was carried out in three centers. Patients with cirrhosis (78% alcoholic), hepatic venous pressure gradients greater than 12 mm Hg and endoscopically proven esophageal varices were randomly assigned to propranolol (51 patients) or placebo (51 patients). Of the 102 patients, 58% were Child's class A, 34% were Child's class B and 8% were Child's class C. Daily dosage was determined by the administration of progressively increasing doses of propranolol with the hepatic vein catheter in place to achieve a 25% decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient, a decrease in hepatic venous pressure gradient to less than 12 mm Hg or a decrease in resting heart rate to less than 55 beats/min. During a mean follow-up period of 16.3 mo, 11 patients in the placebo group (22%) bled from esophageal varices compared with 2 in the propranolol group (4%) during a mean period of 17.1 mo (p less than 0.01). Three additional patients (6%) in the placebo group bled from portal hypertensive gastropathy compared with none in the propranolol group. Propranolol appeared effective in preventing bleeding from large varices. Eleven deaths (22%) occurred in the placebo group compared with eight deaths (16%) in the propranolol group (NS). The mean dose of propranolol was 132 mg/day, and the median dose was 80 mg/day. Using a compliance index (pill count, clinic attendance, alcohol and propranolol levels and alcohol history), 81% of the propranolol patients and 77% of the placebo patients were considered compliant. Complications severe enough to require cessation of therapy occurred in eight patients (16%) in the propranolol group and four in the placebo group (8%) (NS). We conclude that propranolol effectively prevents the first variceal hemorrhage in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and large esophageal varices but does not improve survival. 
Verapamil and migraine prophylaxis: mechanisms and efficacy. Calcium channel blockers have demonstrated efficacy in investigative use for prophylaxis of migraine and cluster headaches. In particular, verapamil, with its low side-effect profile, appears to be a promising alternative to the currently available agents for prophylactic treatment of chronic recurring headaches. Although its exact mechanisms of action in this application are unknown, verapamil exerts a vasodilatory effect on cerebral arteries and interacts with serotonergic systems involved in migraine pathogenesis. A review of studies from the past decade indicates that verapamil may be as effective as traditional therapies as prophylaxis for the major types of chronic recurring headache. 
Celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery injury associated with left radical nephrectomy for locally advanced renal cell carcinoma. The superior mesenteric artery and celiac axis were inadvertently ligated during left radical nephrectomy for a large upper pole renal carcinoma with massive perihilar and periaortic adenopathy. Computer-generated 3-dimensional illustrations created from the computerized tomography scan demonstrated the close proximity between these visceral branches and the adenopathy mass complex, and showed how this bulky disease may interfere with surgical anatomy. When left radical nephrectomy is performed for locally advanced and/or bulky node-positive renal neoplasms, surgeons must be cognizant of the location of the major visceral arterial branches and possible anatomical distortions. 
Persistence of symptoms after gall bladder clearance with cholecystolithotripsy. Forty six patients rendered stone and fragment free with successful cholecystolithotripsy without the use of oral chemolitholysis were followed by serial ultrasound for a period of two to 25 months (mean 11 months, median 10 months). Seven patients (15%), six of whom remain asymptomatic, developed recurrent calculi. Of the 39 gall stone free patients, 26 were asymptomatic. Six patients complained of persistent abdominal pain similar to that before treatment. One of these had a bile duct stone. Seven patients complained of a variety of non-biliary symptoms. The patient with recurrent gall stones and recurrent symptoms is eligible for further lithotripsy treatment. The overall 30% incidence of persistent abdominal symptoms is similar to that reported after elective cholecystectomy. 
Pathogenesis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Several pathophysiologic abnormalities known to be associated with the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are reviewed. Among them are the contributions of lower esophageal sphincter pressure, length, and relaxation, the role of hiatal hernia, delayed esophageal acid clearance, and impaired esophageal mucosal resistance. Gastric factors--volume, secretion, the character of the refluxant, and the rate of gastric emptying--also play a role in the pathogenesis of GERD. Treatment requires an individualized approach based on the extent of the symptoms, esophagitis, and other reflux complications. Three phases of treatment--lifestyle modifications, pharmacologic manipulation, and surgery--are discussed, as is maintenance therapy and prevention of recurrent disease. 
Cervical anterior spinal artery syndrome associated with cardiopulmonary arrest. Nontraumatic spinal cord ischemia is uncommon, especially when the cervical cord is involved. We present an elderly man who sustained acute occlusion of the anterior spinal artery at a high cervical level. This was followed by a respiratory arrest due to the paralysis of the diaphragm and chest wall muscles. A review of the vascular supply to the cord and of nontraumatic ischemic myelopathy is provided. 
Dobutamine versus dipyridamole echocardiography in coronary artery disease. Dobutamine and dipyridamole echocardiography are gaining popularity as exercise-independent stress tests for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. To compare the feasibility, sensitivity, and specificity of dobutamine echocardiography to dipyridamole echocardiography, we conducted both tests, on different days and in random order, on 35 patients with chest pain and suspected coronary artery disease. Dobutamine was administered in scalar doses up to 40 micrograms/kg per minute and dipyridamole up to 0.84 mg/kg for 10 minutes. Dobutamine echocardiography testing was positive in eight of 16 (50%) patients with single-vessel disease and in 11 of 12 (92%) patients with multivessel disease, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 68% for the presence of coronary artery disease. Dipyridamole echocardiography testing showed the same sensitivity as dobutamine in patients with multivessel disease but a lower sensitivity (31%) in single-vessel disease, resulting in an overall sensitivity of 57%. The specificity of both tests was 100%. An ST segment shift of more than 1 mm compared with baseline was documented in 74% of the positive dobutamine echocardiography tests and in 81% of the positive dipyridamole echocardiography tests. No major complications occurred during both tests. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 11 patients with dobutamine and in none with dipyridamole (31% versus 0%, p less than 0.001). Thus, in our selected population dobutamine echocardiography testing demonstrated a similar overall sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease compared with dipyridamole, with a slightly better sensitivity for single-vessel disease but a greater arrhythmogenic potential. 
Scintigraphic assessment of sympathetic innervation after transmural versus nontransmural myocardial infarction To evaluate the feasibility of detecting denervated myocardium in the infarcted canine heart, the distribution of sympathetic nerve endings using I-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) was compared with the distribution of perfusion using thallium-201, with the aid of color-coded computer functional map in 16 dogs. Twelve dogs underwent myocardial infarction by injection of vinyl latex into the left anterior descending coronary artery (transmural myocardial infarction, n = 6), or ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (nontransmural myocardial infarction, n = 6). Four dogs served as sham-operated controls. Image patterns were compared with tissue norepinephrine content and with histofluorescence microscopic findings in biopsy specimens. Hearts with transmural infarction showed zones of absent MIBG and thallium, indicating scar. Adjacent and distal regions showed reduced MIBG but normal thallium uptake, indicating viable but denervated myocardium. Denervation distal to infarction was confirmed by reduced norepinephrine content and absence of nerve fluorescence. Nontransmural myocardial infarction showed zones of wall thinning with decreased thallium uptake and a greater reduction or absence of MIBG localized to the region of the infarct, with minimal extension of denervation beyond the infarct. Norepinephrine content was significantly reduced in the infarct zone, and nerve fluorescence was absent. These findings suggest that 1) MIBG imaging can detect viable and perfused but denervated myocardium after infarction; and 2) as opposed to the distal denervation produced by transmural infarction, nontransmural infarction may lead to regional ischemic damage of sympathetic nerves, but may spare subepicardial nerve trunks that course through the region of infarction to provide a source of innervation to distal areas of myocardium. 
Vitamin E levels in premenstrual syndrome. To determine whether changes in peripheral vitamin E levels are associated with symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, 10 patients with premenstrual syndrome and 10 control subjects were studied. They gave blood at 2- or 3-day intervals throughout three menstrual cycles. The vitamin E was measured by fluorometry after hexane extraction and luteinizing hormone was measured by radioimmunoassay. In the control group, vitamin E values were 854 +/- 45 micrograms/dl (mean +/- SE) during the luteal phase and 925 +/- 55 micrograms/dl during the follicular phase. No significant changes were noted between the two values. In the patients with premenstrual syndrome, the values were 849 +/- 53 micrograms/dl during the luteal phase, which was not significantly different from 858 +/- 48 micrograms/dl during the follicular phase. No significant changes were noted between the control group and the patients with premenstrual syndrome in either the luteal or the follicular phase. Vitamin E deficiency in patients with premenstrual syndrome was not shown by peripheral vitamin E levels in our study. 
Treatment of pseudotumor cerebri by primary and secondary optic nerve sheath decompression. We performed optic nerve sheath decompression in 53 patients (101 eyes) with pseudotumor cerebri and visual loss. Sixty-nine eyes (85 patients) with acute papilledema uniformly had improved visual function after optic nerve sheath decompression. Of 32 eyes with chronic papilledema (18 patients), only ten had improved visual function after optic nerve sheath decompression. This difference was significant (P = .0001). Thirteen eyes required secondary or tertiary optic nerve sheath decompression after an initial successful result. Eleven of 13 eyes had improved visual function after repeat optic nerve sheath decompression. We believe that patients with acute papilledema and visual loss should be offered optic nerve sheath decompression, and if symptoms recur, repeat optic nerve sheath decompression is a safe and effective treatment option. 
The role of tagged red blood cell imaging in the localization of gastrointestinal bleeding. The records of 162 patients who underwent technetium-99m-tagged red blood cell scans for the localization of gastrointestinal hemorrhage were studied. Ninety-eight scans were read as positive, with bleeding sites determined by a radiologist. Forty-six patients had a definitive diagnosis made by other means. Tagged scans accurately localized the site of bleeding in only 52% of cases. Analysis of the value of these tagged scans in predicting a subsequent positive angiogram indicated that there were 14 positive and 12 negative angiograms of 26 positive scans. Of the nine patients with negative scans who underwent arteriography, the arteriogram was positive in five. These data suggest that tagged red blood cell scanning is a poor diagnostic technique for the localization of gastrointestinal bleeding, and its use as a screening tool before angiography is questionable. 
Double anal canal: complication of rectal fecalith. Fecaliths and stercoraceous ulcerations are well-known complications of chronic constipation. The authors present the case of a double anal canal in an elderly man. This anorectal fistula (complex anal fistula) developed as a complication of an impacted rectal fecalith with resultant stercoraceous ulceration. Eventually, a persistent epithelialized canal developed and was demonstrated at double-contrast barium enema examination. The patient remained continent at all times. 
Antispasmodic effects of flavoxate, MFCA, and REC 15/2053 on smooth muscle of human prostate and urinary bladder. The antispasmodic effects of the flavone compounds flavoxate hydrochloride, 3-methylflavone carboxylic acid (MFCA), and REC 15/2053 (and in the case of the detrusor, oxybutynin), on the human detrusor, prostatic adenoma, prostatic capsule, and bladder neck, were studied by the in vitro isometric method. All the compounds inhibited, in different orders of potency, potassium-induced contractions of the tissues. Flavoxate showed a slightly greater activity than the other two compounds in the prostatic and bladder neck tissues. However, REC 15/2053 displayed greater activity in the detrusor than in the other tissues. The relaxant effect on the prostatic tissues suggests a potential use for these compounds in benign prostatic obstruction. 
Effect of halothane on arrhythmogenic responses induced by sympathomimetic agents in single rat heart cells. The combination of catecholamines and halothane has long been recognized as arrhythmogenic. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the mechanism of this interaction originates at the single cell level. The incidence of spontaneous contractile waves occurring between stimulated beats (interbeat waves), early aftercontractions, and late aftercontractions was measured in rat myocytes exposed to sympathomimetics with and without halothane. Each of these endpoints in single cells has the potential to produce arrhythmias in multicellular preparations. Interbeat waves and late aftercontractions were observed with isoproterenol (1 X 10(-7) M) and norepinephrine (1-3 X 10(-7) M). The incidence of these phenomena was significantly reduced in the presence of 0.30 mM halothane. Early aftercontractions occurred in the presence of isoproterenol (1 X 10(-7) M), norepinephrine (1-3 X 10(-7) M), and phenylephrine (5-10 X 10(-6) M). There was a statistically significant decrease in the incidence of early aftercontractions in the presence of 0.30 mM halothane. These results indicate that the mechanism behind the clinically observed increased arrhythmogenicity of catecholamines with halothane does not arise at the level of single ventricular cells because halothane inhibited sympathomimetic-induced arrhythmogenic activity in this model. The probable mechanisms rather include altered impulse propagation, which might lead to phenomena such as reentry. 
Insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension. Parallels between human disease and rodent models. There is considerable evidence that abnormalities of glucose, insulin, and lipoprotein metabolism occur more frequently in untreated hypertensive patients than in normotensive control subjects. More recently, it has also become apparent that similar metabolic abnormalities occur in rodent models of hypertension. One purpose of this article is to review the experimental data that have led to the above generalizations. The second goal is to address the significance of these findings, which is certainly not clear. For example, it could be argued that the relationship between high blood pressure and the associated metabolic defects is incidental. On the other hand, there is evidence that the changes in glucose, insulin, and lipoprotein metabolism may play a role in the etiology and/or clinical course of patients with high blood pressure. Although it is impossible at this point to definitively choose between these possibilities, an effort is made to marshal the evidence in support of the latter alternative. 
Controlling gastric pH: the impact of newer agents on the critically ill patient. The critically ill patient is at increased risk for developing erosive injury of the stomach, duodenum, and esophagus. To date, the most effective way to prevent and treat this problem is by assuring excellent intensive care support and by reducing gastric acid secretion. The histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are effective in both prevention and treatment of such gastric mucosal injury. Newer agents are available that have potential for use in this setting, although none have been studied as extensively in critically ill patients as have the H2RAs. These new agents include proglumide, pirenzepine, misoprostol, omeprazole, and somatostatin. To date, only the latter has been extensively studied in critically ill patients. Omeprazole, which suppresses acid very effectively, may be problematic in the critically ill, limited by its oral dosage form, acid-labile properties, and potential drug interactions. 
Experimental hepatocellular carcinoma: MR receptor imaging. Relaxation time measurements and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed in three different animal models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After intravenous administration of asialoglycoprotein-directed arabinogalactan-stabilized ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (10 mumol Fe/kg receptor agent), T2 of normal liver decreased from 41.6 msec +/- 1.0 to 19.4 msec +/- 1.7 (P less than .05) in rats. T2 of HCC implanted in normal liver or liver with chronic hepatitis was essentially unchanged. These results were similar to those obtained by administration of a reticuloendothelial cell-directed conventional iron oxide; however, the required dose of receptor agent was lower. MR imaging in a woodchuck model of virally induced HCC confirmed the distribution of the hepatocyte-directed agent to regions of functioning and differentiated hepatocytes but not to malignant tumor tissue. The results suggest that MR receptor imaging may play a role in the differentiation between primary liver tumor and functional liver tissue such as that in normal liver hepatitis or regenerating nodules. 
Longterm followup after treatment of polyarteritis nodosa and Churg-Strauss angiitis with comparison of steroids, plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide to steroids and plasma exchange. A prospective randomized trial of 71 patients. The Cooperative Study Group for Polyarteritis Nodosa We attempted to define the most effective treatment for polyarteritis nodosa and Churg-Strauss angiitis, with a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial of cyclophosphamide in conjunction with corticosteroids and plasma exchanges, compared to corticosteroids and plasma exchanges. A total of 71 patients who fulfilled clinical, histological and/or arteriographic diagnostic criteria were randomly designated to receive either prednisone and plasma exchanges (group A, n = 39) or cyclophosphamide, prednisone and plasma exchanges (group B, n = 32). The end points of the study were control of the disease (recovery and remission) and death. Upon study entry clinical and laboratory features did not differ in the 2 groups. Treatment was stopped in 19 patients because of ineffectiveness in 10 (9 in Group A) and side effects in 9 (8 in Group B). Initial control of the disease was similar in both groups. At 5 years, 27 patients had completely recovered and 14 patients were in clinical remission. The cyclophosphamide-prednisone-plasma exchange association was beneficial in preventing relapses during longterm followup. Nineteen deaths were reported during the followup period. There was no difference between the 10 year cumulative survival rates of the 2 groups (respectively, 72 and 75%). Thus, the association of cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids and plasma exchanges reduced the incidence of relapses and improved the quality of the clinical response to therapy. 
Intensive liver care and management of acute hepatic failure. In describing acute liver failure, the term fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) is used to denote patients with the most rapid progression, normally defined as the onset of encephalopathy within eight weeks of the onset of symptoms. For patients with a slower onset of encephalopathy, ranging from eight weeks to six months after the onset of symptoms, late-onset hepatic failure is the term used to reflect the overlap in clinical features with some patients with FHF. The importance of accurately determining the type of acute liver failure results from increasing evidence of an inverse relationship between the tempo of disease progression and the chances of recovery. Prognosis is also dependent on the underlying etiology. Principles of management are as follows: (1) an accurate recognition of the tempo of the hepatic failure--fulminant, late onset, acute on chronic--and the establishment of a likely etiology; (2) early detection and treatment of complications, particularly metabolic acidosis (early), renal failure, cerebral edema, and infection (late); (3) optimization of conditions for regeneration by maintenance of a near normal metabolic milieu (with removal of toxins by various methods of artificial liver support if necessary); and (4) early consideration of an orthotopic liver transplant for those patients in the poor prognosis group. Variations in the natural history and clinical features of acute liver failure (ALF) have led to a number of different classifications and subgroupings. Knowledge of these is important in relation to the assessment of prognosis and is even more important now that transplantation is a therapeutic option. 
Current management, local management, and survival statistics of high-grade osteosarcoma. Experience in Japan. To report the current management of high-grade osteosarcoma in Japan, the authors studied the results of 55 cases treated in the authors' institutions and data provided by Osaka University (59 cases), Chiba Oncology Group (97), and Sapporo National Hospital (70). Twenty-five of the 55 cases in the authors' series were treated by limb-salvage surgery, 27 by amputation, and the remainder by chemotherapy. In all 226 cases from the three institutes, 106 were treated by amputation and 120 by limb-salvage surgery. Two local recurrences (4%) were found in the authors' series, three in the Osaka series, and eight in the Chiba series. Five-year accumulative survival rates in this study showed some differences, depending upon the institution or upon the protocol employed: in the authors' series it was 60% overall and 68% for a stronger chemotherapy group; in the Osaka series, it was 50% in a mild chemotherapy group and 72% in an intensive chemotherapy group; and in the Sapporo series, it was 36% and 73%, respectively. This study showed that local control of IIB osteosarcoma was successfully achieved by preoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and wide resection, and that an intensive chemotherapeutic combination of high-dose methotrexate, cisplatinum, and doxorubicin is promising. 
Successful epicardial pacing in blunt trauma resuscitation. Epicardial pacing wires were used successfully in the resuscitation of a moribund victim of blunt trauma after fluid resuscitation and chemical measures had failed. Application of these wires to treat the bradycardia of shock should be considered in selected patients when standard measures fail. 
Development of sustained achlorhydria in a patient with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated with omeprazole. Spontaneous remission of gastric acid hypersecretion in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome occurs rarely. This study shows the development of gastric secretory mucosal atrophy resulting in achlorhydria and loss of pepsin secretion in a 63-year-old woman with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Reduced secretion began soon after starting treatment with omeprazole, and achlorhydria became complete 6 months later. The patient remains well with normal endoscopy results and is achlorhydric 4 years after the start of treatment and 34 months after stopping omeprazole. She was not colonized with Helicobacter pylori until 36 months after developing achlorhydria. Serum gastrin has increased from 1000 to between 5000 and 12,500 ng/L (pg/mL), was not suppressible by gastric acidification, and was not associated with G-cell hyperplasia. She also has a normal Schilling test and normal immunoglobulins, and lacks antibodies to parietal cells or H+, K(+)-ATPase. Moderate enterochromaffinlike cell hyperplasia is apparent for the first time on the latest biopsy sample. 
Comparison of oral iodine-131-cellulose and indium-111-DTPA as tracers for colon transit scintigraphy: analysis by colon activity profiles. In 11 normal subjects and 11 patients with a clinical diagnosis of constipation, oral 131I-cellulose and 111In-DTPA were compared simultaneously as tracers for radionuclide colon transit scintigraphy. Visual assessment of the images revealed no differences between tracers. Quantitation was performed using total and segmental percent retention and the derived value of clearance half-time. In addition, profiles of the activity distribution along the length of the colon were generated and the mean position of the activity in the colon calculated. For all indices, the results were similar in both normal subjects and constipated patients when comparing tracers, although marked differences were present between normal subjects and constipated patients for each tracer. Indium-111-DTPA was easy to administer and dosimetry was more acceptable than for 131I-cellulose, especially in constipated patients. It is concluded that 111In-DTPA is the preferred tracer for oral colon transit scintigraphy. 
Quality of life before and after orthotopic hepatic transplantation. Fifty-three nonalcoholic patients were evaluated prior to liver transplantation and again approximately 3 years after surgery using the Sickness Impact Profile and Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule. Test-retest scores reflected significant improvement across all health and psychosocial scales of the Sickness Impact Profile. On the Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule, significant improvement was observed on scales measuring disturbed behavior, social role performance, and burden. Comparisons between groups indicated that the liver transplant patients were still impaired on eight of the Sickness Impact Profile scales after transplant; however, the severity of disturbance was not considered to be clinically significant. No between-group differences were noted on the Social Behavior Adjustment Schedule. These results indicate that liver transplantation is associated with substantial improvement in life quality, although as a group, the patients undergoing this surgery do not recover to the level of functioning demonstrated by normal individuals. 
Legionella myositis. Neuromuscular involvement in patients with legionnaires' disease is common, with serum CK elevations in up to 78% of patients. A few cases have been associated with neuropathy. The mechanism of injury to the neuromuscular system is unknown, but organisms have not previously been found in nerve or muscle. We report the clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic findings in a patient with Legionella myositis and motor neuropathy, the first case to demonstrate direct muscle invasion by the Legionella organism. 
Hemorrhagic venous infarction after excision of an arteriovenous malformation: case report. A case of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in which postoperative hemorrhagic infarction developed, probably because of occlusion of the former draining veins, is reported. The hemorrhage developed in the temporal lobe 3 days after the initial operation and was located in the immediate vicinity of the site of the AVM. The following findings suggest that the postsurgical hemorrhage probably resulted from a venous thrombosis: 1) no evidence of residual AVM; 2) delayed onset of the hemorrhage, inconsistent with the time course of a hemorrhage developing according to the breakthrough theory or with insufficient hemostasis with a high-pressure afterload; 3) good correlation between the location of the hemorrhage and the occlusion of the draining veins; and 4) multifocal hemorrhage affecting both the gray matter and the subcortical white matter. Postoperative hemorrhagic infarction caused by thrombosis in the draining veins is rare, but it should be considered as a distinct postoperative complication after removal of an AVM. 
Isolation of Jamestown Canyon virus from boreal Aedes mosquitoes from the Sierra Nevada of California. More than 28,000 mosquitoes in four genera were collected from high elevation (greater than or equal to 1,000 m) areas of California during 1988-89 and tested for virus by plaque assay in Vero cells. Viruses were serogrouped by enzyme immunoassay and serotyped by cross-neutralization. Six strains of Jamestown Canyon virus in the California serogroup were isolated from three species of boreal Aedes in the Aedes communis group of the subgenus Ochlerotatus. All isolates were from mosquitoes collected in Alpine County at approximately 2,300 m elevation in the Sierra Nevada. These included one virus from a pool of male Aedes cataphylla collected in immature stages, which is evidence for vertical transmission; four viruses from adult female Ae. communis (sens. lat.); and one virus from adult female Aedes hexodontus. These are the first isolations of viruses from boreal Aedes mosquitoes in California and the first reported isolations of Jamestown Canyon virus from Ae. cataphylla or Ae. hexodontus. 
Abnormal perception of visceral pain in response to gastric distension in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia. The irritable stomach syndrome. Sensory and pressure responses to gastric distension were evaluated in 24 consecutive patients suffering from chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and 20 healthy subjects. A latex balloon was placed in the proximal stomach and inflated by increments of 100 ml of air up to a maximal volume of 800 ml. Symptom response and intragastric pressure-volume curve were recorded during the gradual balloon distension. Thirteen of the 24 patients experienced pain at a distension volume less than or equal to 400 ml of air, but only one of the 20 controls (P less than 0.001). Intragastric pressure-volume curves were similar in patients and controls, and in patients with and without abnormal pain threshold, suggesting that a compliance defect was not the cause of the sensory anomaly. Gastric emptying of solids and liquids was measured in 20 of the 24 patients using a dual isotopic technique; psychological status was also evaluated in 18 patients using the Mini-Mult test. The frequency of the sensory anomaly was not different in patients with (7/14) or without (4/6) gastric stasis, but was lower in patients with (5/13) than in those without psychological disturbances (5/5, P less than 0.01). Thus, a primary visceral sensory anomaly, either alone or in conjunction with motility disturbances, can play an important role in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and must be taken in account for further therapeutic research. 
Acquired tracheal stenosis in infants and children. Acquired tracheal stenosis in childhood is frequently difficult to manage because of poor healing, infection, and scarring. In a 10-year period, 62 patients (4 weeks to 14 years of age) were treated for acquired tracheal stenosis. The causes of stenosis were endotracheal intubation (44 patients), caustic aspiration (6 patients), recurrent infection (5 patients), bronchoscopic perforation (4 patients), and gastric aspiration (3 patients). The subglottic or upper trachea was involved in 47 patients, mid portion in 8, and distal or carinal area in 7. Fifty children underwent tracheostomy as part of the therapy, and 12 were managed without tracheostomy. Therapy was individualized, frequently sequentially, utilizing rigid or balloon dilatation (20 patients), bronchoscopic electrocoagulation resection (44 patients), steroid injection (48 patients), T tube stent (8 patients), resection with anastomosis (12 patients), cricoid split (3 patients), and rib cartilage graft (12 patients). Most patients required several techniques and repeated procedures to eventually achieve decannulation. Seven patients (11%) died of unrelated causes. Forty-four of 55 surviving patients (80%) are without tracheostomy, although 14 have required continued endotracheal treatment after tracheostomy removal (dilatation, endotracheal resection). This series demonstrates that acquired tracheal stenosis in childhood is a common, difficult problem, but manageable with the use of a variety of techniques. Resection and grafting procedures should be reserved for cases in which less complex modalities fail. 
Labyrinthine ossification after meningitis: its implications for cochlear implantation. Labyrinthine ossification can be found in a high percentage of patients with profound deafness resulting from bacterial meningitis. Radiographic evidence of ossification can be found as early as 2 months after the acute infection, indicating that the intracochlear process probably begins much earlier. If long, intracochlear cochlear implants are to be most successfully used in these patients, an aggressive approach to clinical management following the meningitis should be taken. Illustrative case reports and suggested guidelines for evaluation and treatment are given. 
Limitations of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction complicated by congestive heart failure and cardiogenic shock. As many as one quarter of patients treated with thrombolytic therapy present with congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock. Although thrombolytic therapy has been shown to limit infarct size, preserve left ventricular ejection fraction and decrease mortality in most subgroups of patients, no apparent benefit has been demonstrated in patients with clinical left ventricular dysfunction. The lack of correlation between ejection fraction and other measurements of left ventricular dysfunction such as exercise time, cardiac output, filling pressures, activation of the neurohumoral system and regional perfusion bed abnormalities may partly explain this paradox. Alternatively, lower perfusion rates, higher reocclusion rates, associated mechanical complications or completed infarction may explain these findings. Preliminary data indicate that emergency coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery improves survival in selected patients with cardiogenic shock. Because these findings suggest that restoration of infarct artery patency is especially important in patients with clinical left ventricular dysfunction, additional studies are needed in these patients to investigate the potential benefit that new thrombolytic strategies, inotropic or vasodilator agents or intraaortic balloon counterpulsation might offer by augmenting coronary blood flow and improving reperfusion rates. Currently, acute mechanical revascularization should be considered for patients who present with congestive heart failure associated with hypotension or tachycardia and for patients with cardiogenic shock. 
Effects of asymptomatic ischemia on long-term prognosis in chronic stable coronary disease. BACKGROUND. Ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring has been shown to adversely affect short-term prognoses in patients with unstable angina, after myocardial infarction, and with chronic stable angina. METHODS AND RESULTS. In this long-term study, we followed 138 patients (mean age, 59 +/- 9 years) with chronic stable angina and positive exercise tests for cardiac events (e.g. death, myocardial infarction, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or coronary artery bypass graft surgery). In 105 patients, ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed after all antianginal medication was withheld for 48 hours. In 26 patients, the diagnostic tests were repeated while on their usual medication. In addition to the 105 patients, 33 patients had their monitoring performed only while on their usual medication. During 37 +/- 17 months of follow-up, there were nine deaths, nine myocardial infarctions, and 35 revascularization procedures. In patients monitored off medication, Cox survival analysis showed that the occurrence of ischemia on electrocardiographic monitoring was the most significant predictor of death and myocardial infarction in the subsequent 2 years (p = 0.02) and all adverse events for 5 years (p = 0.009). Patients who were monitored on medication and did not have ischemia (n = 18) appeared to have more adverse events than patients who had no ischemia while being monitored off medication (n = 43). CONCLUSIONS. Asymptomatic ischemia on ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in patients with stable angina predicts death and myocardial infarction for 2 years and all adverse events for 5 years. Monitoring performed while on medication may show no ischemia; however, this may not indicate low risk of future coronary events. 
Incidence of left ventricular thrombi formation after thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, heparin, and aspirin in patients with acute myocardial infarction. To evaluate the prevalence of left ventricular thrombi after thrombolytic therapy, 144 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were prospectively studied with two-dimensional echocardiography 1 and 8 days after admission. Patients were treated 2.1 +/- 0.8 hours after the onset of symptoms. Thrombolytic protocol included 120 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), 5000 IU of heparin, followed by a continuous infusion of 25,000 IU/24 hours for at least 5 days, and 250 mg of aspirin a day. Seventy-six patients had AMI of the anterior wall; of these, seven (9.2%) developed left ventricular thrombi. The remaining 68 patients had infarctions of the inferior wall; of these, two (2.9%) developed left ventricular thrombi. Since anterior wall infarction not treated with thrombolytic therapy is associated with a 25% to 40% rate of left ventricular thrombi, we conclude that early thrombolytic therapy with rt-PA, heparin, and aspirin reduces the formation of left ventricular thrombus in AMI of the anterior wall. Apical left ventricular thrombi developed more frequently in patients with previous infarctions compared with those without (4 of 17 versus 4 of 127, p = 0.01). During the 12-month follow-up period, no patient in the study had manifestations of peripheral emboli. 
Auriculotemporal syndrome following the preauricular approach to temporomandibular joint surgery. Forty-seven joints in 28 patients were examined 4 months to 10 years after temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery via a modified preauricular approach. Many patients had undergone multiple procedures. None of the patients had any subjective or objective evidence of auriculotemporal syndrome (ATS), although patients in previous studies with more extensive incisions have demonstrated ATS. It was concluded that ATS is an unlikely complication following TMJ surgery. A small incision without an oblique superior extension may further reduce the risk. 
Scanning electron microscopic study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The study has been carried out on biopsies taken from four patients affected by squamous cell carcinoma and four patients affected by undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT). Three healthy volunteers have served as controls. All the specimens have been studied by SEM. The neoplastic conditions cause obvious alterations both in the mucosal surface and in the morphology of the cellular apex. 
Human alveolar macrophage antibacterial activity in the alcoholic lung. Alcoholic individuals are predisposed to respiratory infections. However, mechanisms of perturbations leading to increased susceptibility to lung infections of individuals with alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) are not fully understood. We studied the antibacterial activity and oxidant generation (before and after stimulation by phorbol myristate acetate or opsonized zymosan) of alveolar macrophages from 16 patients with ALC. Our results were compared with those obtained from 12 healthy control subjects, from 8 patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and from 8 alcoholic individuals without cirrhosis. All were nonsmokers, had normal chest X-rays, and did not present evidence of lung infection 3 months before. The total number of cells recovered by bronchoalveolar lavage did not significantly differ between control subjects and patients. The cellular viability of alveolar macrophages (trypan blue exclusion) was greater than 90% in all cases. The antibacterial activity of alveolar macrophages versus Staphylococcus aureus was severely impaired in ALC (-21 +/- 8.2%) whereas it was normal in PBC (52 +/- 4.2%), in alcoholic subjects (44.6 +/- 5.4%), and in control subjects (60 +/- 5.5%). The same pattern of results was observed versus Escherichia coli (-47.7 +/- 10,28 +/- 8,28 +/- 12, and 29 +/- 8.5%, respectively). Previous incubation of normal alveolar macrophages with serum or BAL fluid from ALC patients or with normal serum or normal BAL fluid did not result in a significant decrease in antibacterial activity of normal alveolar macrophages. To distinguish ingested bacteria from adherent extracellular bacteria, cells that had been incubated with bacteria for 90 min were then incubated with lysostaphin (1 microgram/ml). 
The occurrence of epilepsy and febrile seizures in Virginian and Norwegian twins. Twin studies provide an efficient method for examining the importance of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of disorders such as epilepsy. Population-based twin registries are especially valuable for studies of this type since effects of reporting and self-selection biases on the resulting data are minimized. Among 14,352 twin pairs contained in the Virginia and Norwegian twin panels for whom questionnaire information was available, there was a history of epilepsy in one or both members of 286 pairs; febrile seizures were reported in 257 pairs. Analyses of questionnaire data revealed no significant differences in concordance rates between Virginian and Norwegian twins for either epilepsy or febrile seizures. Probandwise concordance rates for epilepsy were 0.19 in monozygotic twins and 0.07 in dizygotic twins. Analogous rates for febrile seizures were 0.33 (monozygotic) and 0.11 (dizygotic). These results provide further evidence that genetic factors do have a role in the expression of epilepsy and febrile seizures. 
Effects of acetylsalicylic acid on renal function in patients with chronic heart failure. PURPOSE: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether the administration of acetylsalicylic acid has adverse effects on renal function in patients with moderate chronic congestive heart failure with and without stimulation of the renin system. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients were randomly assigned to one of the following four groups: Group 1, low sodium diet and placebo; Group 2, low sodium diet and acetylsalicylic acid; Group 3, normal sodium diet and placebo; or Group 4, normal sodium diet and acetylsalicylic acid. Patients were studied over 8 days. After Day 5, patients in Groups 2 and 4 received acetylsalicylic acid (500 mg three times a day). The low sodium diet consisted of 13.6 mmol of sodium per day and the normal sodium diet consisted of 136 mmol of sodium per day. RESULTS: The low sodium diet resulted in a highly significant increase in the plasma renin (2p = 0.0001), aldosterone (2p = 0.0006), and urinary prostaglandin E2 (2p = 0.01) concentrations and the renal potassium excretion (2p = 0.0009), whereas renal sodium excretion was significantly reduced (2p = 0.0001). Severe sodium depletion led to a reduction of the glomerular filtration rate (2p = 0.007), which was independent from cyclooxygenase inhibition. In patients on the low sodium diet, acetylsalicylic acid reduced the elevated urinary prostaglandin E2 levels to normal values without changing the renal sodium excretion rate. In patients with a normal sodium intake, acetylsalicylic acid significantly reduced the renal sodium excretion rate by 29% (2p = 0.04). CONCLUSION: We conclude that severe sodium depletion has adverse effects on kidney function in patients with heart failure due to a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate. Administration of acetylsalicylic acid in doses that reduce the synthesis of renal prostaglandin E2 significantly reduces renal sodium excretion. 
Cardiovascular and catecholamine responses to head-up tilt in the diagnosis of recurrent unexplained syncope in elderly patients. To increase understanding of the mechanisms causing syncope in patients over the age of 60, hemodynamic and hormonal responses to 60 minutes of 60 degree head-up tilt were examined in 10 patients with recurrent syncope of unknown origin and five controls with no history of syncope. Nine of 10 patients and all five controls experienced orthostatic intolerance on the tilt table. Syncope or pre-syncope occurred later in controls than in those syncope patients who had exact reproduction of their clinical symptoms (median time 52 versus 22 minutes, P = 0.05). Three different mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance were identified in the 14 subjects: (1) vasovagal syncope, n = 9 (sudden hypotension +/- bradycardia); (2) dysautonomic syncope, n = 3 (immediate and gradual parallel declines in both systolic and diastolic pressures with blunted increase in heart rate); (3) psychogenic or vestibular reaction, n = 2 (orthostatic intolerance without hemodynamic changes). Vasovagal syncope patients showed a significant increase in plasma norepinephrine from baseline to maximum level during tilt (100 +/- 39% increase, P = 0.03) and a subsequent decrease at the time of syncope (30 +/- 5% decrease, P = 0.01), while plasma epinephrine increased markedly from baseline to the time of syncope (827 +/- 154% increase, P = 0.0003). Dysautonomic syncope patients had lower supine levels of norepinephrine compared to vasovagal syncope patients (182 +/- 30 versus 614 +/- 146 pg/mL, P = 0.008) and no significant change in norepinephrine over time; epinephrine levels increased significantly less than in vasovagal patients (net change 38 +/- 8 versus 189 +/- 56 pg/mL, P = 0.008). 
DuP 753 increases survival in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats fed a high sodium diet. We studied the effects of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753, on blood pressure, body weight, plasma renin activity, sodium excretion, and mortality in male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp) fed a 4% NaCl diet for 12 weeks. The rise in blood pressure, due to high sodium intake, was blunted in the first 8 weeks of the study in the DuP 753-treated group; however, it started slowly to rise in the following weeks. In the untreated group, blood pressure rose steadily and it was significantly higher than that of the treated group during the whole experimental period. DuP 753-treated rats gained weight continuously during the study in contrast to the untreated group, where weight gain was arrested after 4 weeks. Plasma renin activity rose significantly after 4 weeks of treatment with DuP 753; by week 6 its values returned to baseline values and remained at these lower values until week 12. In the untreated group, plasma renin activity was not suppressed by high sodium intake after 4 weeks; it continued to rise and it was significantly elevated by 8 and 12 weeks. Survival at 12 weeks was 84% in DuP 753-treated group and 26% in the untreated group. The data demonstrate that DuP 753 decreased mortality and dramatically blunted the blood pressure rise in SHRsp fed a high sodium diet. 
Cardiac tamponade following coronary arterial rupture during coronary angioplasty. We describe a patient in whom percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was complicated by rupture of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with pericardial tamponade. The outcome was favorable with drastic intervention which included: occlusion of the bleeding vessel with the PTCA balloon, pericardiocentesis, and ligation of the vessel without the need of aortocoronary bypass graft. 
Neurocutaneous melanosis: definition and review of the literature. Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by the presence of large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and benign or malignant pigment cell tumors of the leptomeninges. The syndrome is thought to represent an error in the morphogenesis of the embryonal neuroectoderm. We review 39 reported cases of neurocutaneous melanosis and propose revised criteria for diagnosis. Most patients with neurocutaneous melanosis presented in the first 2 years of life with neurologic manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, or spinal cord compression. Leptomeningeal melanoma was present in 62% of the cases, but even in the absence of melanoma, symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis had an extremely poor prognosis. Useful diagnostic procedures include cerebrospinal fluid cytology and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast. Patients may be aided by palliative measures such as shunt placement to reduce intracranial pressure. Dermatologists in their follow-up of patients with large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi should be aware of this condition, to aid in prompt diagnosis and because the treatment of cutaneous lesions may be altered in the presence of symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis. 
Bilateral central retinal vein occlusion as an initial manifestation of pseudotumor cerebri. Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is known to produce visual symptoms. Central retinal vein occlusion has been linked with pseudotumor cerebri but rarely as an initial manifestation. We describe a 46-year-old patient--who was obese and mildly hypertensive with bilateral central retinal vein occlusions--who was subsequently diagnosed as having pseudotumor cerebri. In patients with simultaneous bilateral central retinal vein occlusions, unusual underlying systemic conditions such as pseudotumor cerebri should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation. 
Primary sclerosing cholangitis: surgical options, prognostic variables and outcome. The natural history of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is poorly defined and its management remains controversial. Forty-eight symptomatic patients (median age 39 years, range 8-67 years; 30 male) with PSC were reviewed retrospectively. Thirty patients had inflammatory bowel disease. Four patients (8 per cent) developed or had an associated malignancy. Twenty-one (44 per cent) died; overall 5 year actuarial survival was 30 per cent. Twenty-three patients had 27 non-transplant related biliary operations (16 patients specifically for PSC) of whom 12 died. Serum bilirubin was the only parameter to improve after biliary surgery. Seventeen patients (35 per cent) underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) of whom nine are currently alive (1 year projected survival of 55 per cent). Previous biliary surgery correlated with a poor outcome (P less than 0.0001) after OLT. Being male, presence of cirrhosis, duration of symptomatic disease (greater than 3 years) and a serum bilirubin level greater than 100 mumol/l at presentation, were independently associated with a poor outcome (P less than 0.05). These data provide evidence that PSC is a progressive disease and conventional surgical options have little influence on the outcome. Previous biliary surgery adversely affects outcome following OLT. For progressive liver disease, liver transplantation should be considered the treatment of choice. 
Total hip arthroplasty. The role of antiinflammatory medications in the prevention of heterotopic ossification. Postoperative prophylaxis with antiinflammatory medications, primarily indomethacin, is extremely effective in preventing the severest degrees of heterotopic ossification (HO) after a total hip arthroplasty (THA) and the recurrence of excised HO developed after a previous hip surgery. Prophylaxis with indomethacin should be given in 25-mg doses three times daily for at least three weeks, starting on the first postoperative morning. However, a shorter treatment period may be equally effective in preventing the severest degrees of HO, and a postoperative delay of five days before the initiation of prophylaxis does not seem to be followed by the development of severe HO. As evaluated one year after surgery, treatment with antiinflammatory medications in the immediate postoperative weeks did not increase the incidence of implant-bone interface radiolucencies, aseptic loosening, or revisions in cemented or cementless THAs when compared with cases that did not have postoperative treatment. However, although no major complications have been reported regarding the use of antiinflammatory medications in the prevention of HO after THA, orthopedic surgeons prescribing such treatment should be aware of their contraindications as well as early and late side effects. Since several antiinflammatory agents are reported to be effective in preventing HO, future reports dealing with HO after THA should always include information about the postoperative antiinflammatory treatment used. 
T-cell receptor tau delta +/CD3+4-8-T- cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias: a distinct subgroup of leukemias in children. A report of five cases. In a 10-year study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) in children, we have identified five cases expressing the T-cell receptor tau delta (TCR tau delta). The incidence (26%) of TCR tau delta+T-cell leukemias in our material was high. Clinically, the TCR tau delta+ leukemias represented a distinct subgroup of T-cell leukemias. Mean age at onset of disease, 1.8 years, was remarkably low for mature T-cell leukemias. White blood cell counts were high, lymph node enlargements were discrete, and no mediastinal tumors were seen. Four of five TCR tau delta+ leukemias carried rearrangements of the C tau 2 gene, and transcribed the T-early alpha genetic element. 
Detection of micrometastatic tumor cells in bone marrow of breast carcinoma patients. To determine the incidence and clinical significance of micrometastases in the bone marrow of breast carcinoma patients, we performed an immunoalkaline phosphatase assay using anticytokeratin (AE1, AE3, MAK-6) and antiepithelial (113F1, 260F9, 317G5) antibodies on the bone marrow aspirates of 71 stage IV disease patients with either recurrent regional or distant metastases. Although we detected tumor cells within the bone marrow of 38% of these patients with this assay, no significant correlation was seen with patient's age, menopausal status, bone scan, bone marrow core histology, response to induction chemotherapy, number of metastatic sites, dominant site of metastasis, or subsequent clinical outcome. The clinical parameters that were associated with improved survival were one dominant site of metastatic disease and regional soft tissue recurrence without distant disease. 
Wegener's granulomatosis with renal involvement: patient survival and correlations between initial renal function, renal histology, therapy and renal outcome. Patient survival and renal outcome were followed in 25 patients with biopsy confirmed Wegener's granulomatosis and renal involvement. Fourteen out of 25 patients required dialysis on admission, 11/25 patients did not. All patients were treated with a novel protocol comprising methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide. The median follow-up observation was 36 months (12-113 months). With the exception of 1 patient (who died from causes not related to Wegener's granulomatosis) all patients are alive. Among the patients initially requiring dialysis (n = 14) 4 are in terminal renal failure after 0, 7, 21 and 38 months respectively. In the nondialysis group (n = 11) only 1 patient subsequently required chronic dialysis 30 months after clinical admission. Renal failure was due to non-compliance with immunosuppressive therapy in at least 2 patients. Percentage of obsolescent glomeruli and the degree of tubulointerstitial lesions, but not active glomerular lesions (crescents, necroses) predicted renal outcome. The major cause of renal functional impairment was relapse of Wegener's granulomatosis usually within 2 years after clinical remission. Therefore prolonged treatment with cyclophosphamide for at least 2 years after clinical remission is recommended. Two patients with initially negative immunohistology had a second renal biopsy which revealed de novo appearance of mesangial IgA deposits. 
Prevention and treatment of pregnancy-associated hypertension: what have we learned in the last 10 years? High blood pressure (BP) complicates approximately 10% of all pregnancies. Hypertension in pregnancy falls into four categories: (1) preeclampsia-eclampsia, (2) chronic hypertension of whatever cause, (3) preeclampsia-eclampsia superimposed to chronic hypertension or renal disease, and (4) transient or late hypertension (gestational hypertension). Preeclampsia, the association of hypertension, proteinuria, and edema, accounts for more than 50% of all the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and is a major cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, distinguishing between preeclampsia and other causes of hypertension on clinical grounds can be difficult because of the lack of specific tests for differential diagnosis. Increased vascular resistance has been claimed as the primary cause of preeclampsia; however, a variable hemodynamic profile with relatively high cardiac outputs, normal filling pressures, and inappropriately high systemic vascular resistances is now reported by most investigators. Imbalance between vasodilator and vasoconstrictor eicosanoids may account for platelet activation and increased responsiveness to pressor peptides. Altered prostacyclin (PGI2) to thromboxane A2 (TxA2) ratio in maternal uteroplacental vascular bed may favor local platelet activation and vasoconstriction contributing to placental insufficiency and fetal distress. Alternatively, recent evidence seems to suggest that fetal umbilical placental circulation may be the site of the primary vascular injury. Whether low-dose aspirin prevents preeclampsia because it inhibits the excessive maternal TxA2 or whether the partial inhibition of fetal TxA2 is also of therapeutic value remains to be established. Treatment of severe hypertension in pregnancy is probably important to prevent cardiac failure or cerebrovascular accidents in the mother. The need for pharmacological therapy of mild to moderate hypertension is still debated, since no formal studies are available to clarify whether pharmacological treatment in such instances effectively reduces maternal or fetal risk. For the treatment of preeclampsia, hydralazine and nifedipine may be used when delivery is not applicable. Labetalol and diazoxide are effective for hypertensive emergencies. Life-threatening hypertension that does not respond to more conventional therapy is an indication for the use of sodium nitroprusside. For chronic hypertension, alpha-methyldopa remains the treatment of choice; if ineffective, hydralazine or beta-blockers are suitable. Effectiveness and safety of other molecules remain elusive. 
Air enema for diagnosis and reduction of intussusception: clinical experience and pressure correlates. Air enema was used for exclusion, diagnosis, initial movement, and complete reduction of intussusception in 186 pediatric patients. Average pressure needed for initial movement of intussusception was 56.5 mm Hg; average maximum pressure of 97.8 mm Hg was required for complete reduction. Average fluoroscopy time required for intussusception reduction was 94.8 seconds; an average of 41.8 seconds was required to exclude intussusception. Intussusception was diagnosed in 75 patients, and reduction was accomplished in 65 (87%). Of 100 consecutive patients that underwent hydrostatic reduction of intussusception at the authors' institution, reduction was successful in 55. Compared with hydrostatic enema, air enema involves shorter fluoroscopy time and lower radiation dose to the patient. Air enema is safe and effective for diagnosis and treatment of intussusception in infants and children and has replaced hydrostatic enema for such procedures at the authors' institution. 
A transformation-incompetent, nuclear antigen 2-deleted Epstein-Barr virus associated with replicative infection. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) obtained directly from the oropharynx was used to detect viral DNA deleted for the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2)-encoding gene that is essential for lymphocyte transformation. By polymerase chain reaction analysis, the deletion was found in virus from 5 of 33 healthy adult donors and 11 of 12 patients with concurrent human immunodeficiency virus infection. Lymphoblastoid cell lines that produce standard transforming EBV also harbored EBNA2-deleted virus in cells permissive of EBV replication. In vitro infectivity studies indicated that the DNA is packaged and transmissible, with biologic properties similar to those of a laboratory mutant, P3HR-1, which also lacks the EBNA2 gene. These findings, obtained from productively infected cell systems, provide evidence for the existence in nature of a transformation-incompetent EBV variant that may facilitate EBV persistence and the emergence of reactivation diseases. 
Quantitative evaluation of parenchymal liver cell volume and total hepatocyte number in cirrhotic patients. A simple morphometrical method was developed using a color image analyzing system, which allowed quantitative evaluation of parenchymal liver cell volume and total hepatocyte number in cirrhotic patients. With this method, we estimated these values in 29 cirrhotic patients who underwent hepatic resection (nine cases) or nonshunting operation (20 cases). Liver volume, calculated from computed tomographic images, was 976 +/- 196 cm3 (range = 602 to 1,376 cm3); the parenchymal cell volume ratio, obtained based on liver histological appearance with silver stain, was 0.665 +/- 0.092 (range = 0.510 to 0.881); and the parenchymal cell volume, calculated by multiplying the liver volume with the parenchymal cell volume ratio, was 645 +/- 140 cm3 (range = 403 to 936 cm3). The total hepatocyte number obtained in a similar manner using hematoxylin-stained specimens was 1.72 +/- 0.56 x 10(11) (range = 0.74 to 2.94 x 10(11)). The validity and applicability of the method is discussed, and the data are compared with those reported in other studies. 
K-edge digital subtraction arthrography of the painful hip prosthesis: a feasibility study. K-edge energy subtraction radiography is a method for detecting the presence of iodinated contrast material by subtracting two digital radiographs produced by X-ray beams with energies above and below the iodine K edge. We performed a feasibility study on the application of K-edge energy digital subtraction arthrography (KEDSA) to painful hip prostheses. During arthrography, loosening of the prosthesis is implied if contrast material is seen dissecting around the prosthesis, an often difficult detection task because of adjacent prosthesis metal or cement. In conventional arthrography a preliminary mask image is thus used from which films obtained after injection of iodinated contrast material are subtracted. Movement by the patient during this process may preclude subsequent subtraction. With KEDSA, since multiple image pairs may be obtained after the injection of contrast material, the problem of patient motion is virtually eliminated. A conventional X-ray tube operating between 55 and 65 kVp was alternately filtered by iodine and cerium filters to produce the KEDSA images. The apparatus was capable of producing a subtracted image within 3 sec. The technique was applied to phantoms and to six patients immediately after hip arthrography that had been positive for prosthesis loosening. Although of lower spatial resolution, the KEDSA images were, in all cases, positive for loosening in a pattern consistent with the conventional arthrographic images. KEDSA was shown to be successful in detecting extraarticular contrast material. During a single study, subtraction in various imaging planes as well as postexercise subtraction imaging can be accomplished-techniques not heretofore possible in routine subtraction arthrography. 
Colorectal ornithine decarboxylase activity in human mucosa and tumors: elevation of enzymatic activity in distal mucosa. To examine the value of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) assay as a biological marker of potential malignancy in large bowel, we harvested 43 colorectal carcinoma, 7 adenoma, 6 polyps, and 77 normal-appearing mucosa at surgery from patients with colorectal carcinoma. In addition, 13 normal rectal mucosa were obtained at biopsy from patients with benign diseases or diseases unrelated to colorectal carcinoma as normal control. ODC activity was significantly higher in polyps and adenocarcinomas than in normal-appearing mucosa from patients with colorectal carcinoma. ODC activity in normal-appearing mucosa varied throughout the large intestine, with significantly higher activities in the distal segment of the large bowel. The higher ODC activity detected in the sigmoid colon and rectum correlates with the larger incidence of tumor development in this region of the large bowel. This observation needs to be taken into consideration when ODC activities of the colorectal mucosa are measured as biological markers of potential malignancies. 
Cerebral hemodynamic effects of fluid resuscitation in the presence of an experimental intracranial mass. We addressed the impact on intracranial pressure (ICP) of posthemorrhage fluid resuscitation with a protocol in which additional fluid was infused to maintain a stable cardiac output after an initial bolus of fluid was infused. Anesthetized, mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs (n = 27) underwent a 30-minute interval of hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure = 55 mm Hg) during which inflation of a subdural balloon maintained ICP at 15 mm Hg. After shock, animals were resuscitated with one of four randomly assigned fluids: (1) slightly hypotonic crystalloid (Na+, 125 mEq.L-1; designated Na-125); (2) hypertonic crystalloid (Na+, 250 mEq.L-1; designated Na-250); (3) slightly hypotonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-125P); or (4) hypertonic crystalloid plus 10% pentastarch (Na-250P). Supplemental fluid was administered as needed to maintain cardiac output comparable to baseline values. ICP increased progressively in all fluid groups during resuscitation. Cerebral blood flow, measured by the cerebral venous outflow method, increased immediately after resuscitation and then declined steadily over time in all groups. Fluids containing pentastarch maintained hemodynamic stability with minimal supplementation throughout most of the postresuscitation period, compared with crystalloid alone, which required substantial additional volume. If decreased intracranial compliance and hemorrhage are combined, ongoing resuscitation is associated with significantly increased ICP and significantly decreased cerebral blood flow, independent of the tonicity and oncotic pressure of the infused fluid. 
Abdominal muscle activity during CO2 rebreathing in sleeping neonates. Comparison of the abdominal muscle response to CO2 rebreathing in rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep was performed in healthy premature infants near full term. Eight subjects were studied at a postconceptional age of 40 +/- 1.6 (SD) wk (range 38-43 wk) during spontaneous sleep. Sleep stages were defined on the basis of electrophysiological and behavioral criteria, and diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle electromyographic activity was recorded by cutaneous electrodes. The responses to CO2 were measured by a modified Read rebreathing technique. The minute ventilation and diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle electromyographic activities were calculated and plotted against end-tidal CO2 partial pressure. Both the ventilatory and diaphragmatic muscle responses to CO2 decreased from NREM to REM sleep (P less than 0.05). Abdominal muscles were forcefully recruited in response to CO2 rebreathing during NREM sleep. In REM sleep, abdominal muscle response to CO2 was virtually absent or decreased compared with NREM sleep (P less than 0.05). We conclude that 1) the abdominal muscles are recruited during NREM sleep in response to CO2 rebreathing in healthy premature infants near full term and 2) the abdominal muscle recruitment is inhibited during REM sleep compared with NREM sleep, and this REM sleep-related inhibition probably contributes to the decrease in the ventilatory response to CO2 rebreathing in REM sleep. 
Solvent-associated olfactory dysfunction: not a predictor of deficits in learning and memory. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate associations between olfactory dysfunction and aberrations in learning and memory after chronic occupational exposure to mixed hydrocarbon solvents. METHOD: This was a cross-sectional, epidemiologic study of 187 paint manufacturing workers. The authors administered quantitative tests of olfactory function (the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) and neurobehavioral function (eight computer- and examiner-administered tests of learning and memory) to workers for whom detailed information was available on lifetime occupational exposure to solvents. RESULTS: Olfactory function test scores were positively correlated with performance on seven of eight of the tests of learning and memory in bivariate analyses. After adjustment for important confounding variables (i.e., age, vocabulary score, and cumulative exposure to hydrocarbon solvents) with multiple linear regression, olfactory function scores predicted performance only on the Wechsler Memory Scale Delayed Logical Memory test. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the data did not reveal that olfactory dysfunction was correlated with decrements in various memory functions. 
Urinary pepsinogen I as a tumor marker of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy. The possibility that urinary pepsinogen I is a tumor marker of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy was examined. To decide the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen I after total gastrectomy, urine samples from 15 patients who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer in the early or advanced stages and had been free from recurrence for more than 5 years were examined by pepsinogen I-specific radioimmunoassay. The mean concentration of urinary pepsinogen I was 17.5 +/- 7.4 ng/ml and the cutoff level of urinary pepsinogen after total gastrectomy was set at 32 ng/ml (mean + 2 SD). Twenty-two of 74 cases who had undergone total gastrectomy for stomach cancer were regarded as positive. And 20 of these 22 positive cases had definite clinical signs of recurrence of stomach cancer. There were only two false-positive cases. These results suggest that urinary pepsinogen I will be an useful tumor marker in detecting the recurrence of stomach cancer after total gastrectomy. 
Management of middle third facial fractures. In the management of fractures of the middle third of the face, it should be apparent to the surgeon that the more sophisticated fixation techniques carry increased liability, and their incorrect and imprecise application mandates identification and correction of any contributing factors if malunion is to be avoided. A less sophisticated stabilization technique that, by convention, generally is reliable, less complicated, less expensive, and less intimidating may be preferred. Given the complexity and diversity of midfacial injuries and the variety of available fixation and stabilization techniques, it is unlikely that any one method precisely suits every situation. 
Radiologic features of closed loop obstruction: analysis of 25 confirmed cases. The obstruction of a segment of bowel at two points results in a closed loop obstruction. Progression to strangulation is not an invariable component of this entity when surgical intervention is delayed. Enteroclysis is increasingly being used to evaluate obstruction of the small intestine. The authors retrospectively analyzed 25 surgically confirmed cases of closed loop obstruction and noted four enteroclysis features suggestive of the diagnosis: (a) crossing defects obstructing two segments of a loop of bowel secondary to dense adhesive bands (14 patients), (b) focal fixation of two limbs or twisting of the folds at the point of obstruction suggestive of volvulus (three patients), (c) abdominal wall herniation with obstruction (six patients), and (d) focal intraperitoneal segregation of a loop of bowel with tight obstruction suggestive of internal herniation (two patients). Recognition of the different patterns allows prompt preoperative radiologic diagnosis prior to strangulation. 
Effect of physiologic hyperinsulinemia on glucose and lipid metabolism in cirrhosis. Insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity were evaluated in eight clinically stable cirrhotic patients and in 12 controls. OGTT was normal in cirrhotics but plasma insulin response was increased approximately twofold compared with controls. Subjects received a three-step (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mU/kg.min) euglycemic insulin clamp with indirect calorimetry, [6-3H]-glucose, and [1-14C]-palmitate. During the two highest insulin infusion steps glucose uptake was impaired (3.33 +/- 0.31 vs. 5.06 +/- 0.40 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01, and 6.09 +/- 0.50 vs. 7.95 +/- 0.52 mg/kg.min, P less than 0.01). Stimulation of glucose oxidation by insulin was normal; in contrast, nonoxidative glucose disposal (i.e., glycogen synthesis) was markedly reduced. Fasting (r = -0.553, P less than 0.01) and glucose-stimulated (r = -0.592, P less than 0.01) plasma insulin concentration correlated inversely with the severity of insulin resistance. Basal hepatic glucose production was normal in cirrhotics and suppressed normally with insulin. In postabsorptive state, plasma FFA conc (933 +/- 42 vs. 711 +/- 44 mumol/liter, P less than 0.01) and FFA turnover (9.08 +/- 1.20 vs. 6.03 +/- 0.53 mumol/kg.min, P less than 0.01) were elevated in cirrhotics despite basal hyperinsulinemia; basal FFA oxidation was similar in cirrhotic and control subjects. With low-dose insulin infusion, plasma FFA oxidation and turnover failed to suppress normally in cirrhotics. During the two higher insulin infusion steps, all parameters of FFA metabolism suppressed normally. In summary, stable cirrhotic patients with normal glucose tolerance exhibit marked insulin resistance secondary to the impaired nonoxidative glucose disposal. Our results suggest that chronic hyperinsulinism may be responsible for the insulin resistance observed in cirrhosis. 
Intravascular stents in the management of superior vena cava syndrome. Superior vena cava syndrome can be effectively palliated with the use of intravascular stents. Adjunctive modalities which may be utilized prior to stent placement are thrombolytic therapy and balloon angioplasty. Six patients with an underlying malignancy were treated with these modalities. Complete resolution of symptoms occurred in five patients, and partial resolution occurred in the sixth. Two of the patients who had initial, complete resolution of symptoms had recurrences. One involved rethrombosis of the superior vena cava which occurred twice and required percutaneous thrombectomy, and the second involved restenosis requiring a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the SVC just distal to the stent. Both of these patients with second procedures, again, had complete resolution of symptoms. Intravascular stents are a valuable additional treatment of superior vena cava syndrome. 
Regional cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in patients with chronic liver disease. Subtle impairments of cognitive function may be an important cause of occupational and psychosocial morbidity in patients with chronic liver disease. Correlation of structural brain abnormalities with cognitive deficits has yielded inconsistent results. 10 patients with cirrhotic liver disease were compared with 10 age, education, and intelligence matched control subjects. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant overall cognitive impairments in cirrhotic patients compared with controls (p = 0.02). Regional cerebral blood flow was measured by single photon emission computed tomography (SPET or SPECT) and showed increased uptake of radiotracer in the right and left posterior parts of the basal ganglia and right occipital lobe, together with reduced uptake in the right anterior cingulate region. The degree of cognitive impairment was directly correlated with functional abnormalities in the basal ganglia and limbic cortex (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that impaired cognitive status may be associated with abnormalities of regional brain function in patients with chronic liver disease. Since these deficits are clinically inapparent, our findings have important implications for identification and management of patients with chronic liver disease. 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with disseminated toxoplasmosis presenting as an acute pulmonary and gastrointestinal illness. Encephalitis due to the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii has emerged as a common cause of central nervous system disease in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Extraneural disease is less common and more difficult to diagnose. We report a case of widely disseminated toxoplasmosis that presented as acute gastrointestinal and pulmonary disease in a patient without a prior diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The diagnosis of toxoplasmosis was made only at autopsy. Antemortem diagnosis of disseminated T gondii infection requires a high degree of clinical suspicion and the prompt utilization of appropriate diagnostic testing. Since toxoplasmosis is a potentially treatable opportunistic infection, diagnosis allows the swift institution of anti-Toxoplasma therapy. 
Recurrent severe traumatic brain injury. Series of six cases. Six of 141 persons treated for severe traumatic brain injury at the Medical College of Virginia were found to have a history of similar previous injury. These cases are presented in the context of the phenomenon of recurrent severe traumatic brain injury, which has received no systematic attention in epidemiologic studies of trauma. 
The incidence of recurrence and hypothyroidism following treatment with antithyroid drugs, surgery or radioiodine in all patients with thyrotoxicosis in Malmo during the period 1970-1974. The incidence of recurrence and of hypothyroidism was determined in all new patients treated for thyrotoxicosis during the period 1970-1974 in an unselected, well-defined urban population. A total of 309 patients were followed up for a median time period of 108 (1-192) months. There was a cumulative incidence of 51% recurrence in patients who were treated with antithyroid drugs for Graves' thyrotoxicosis, whereas after surgery or radioiodine treatment there were few recurrences, but 32% and 78% cumulative incidences of hypothyroidism. There were no recurrences after surgery or radioiodine treatment in patients with toxic multinodular goitre or solitary toxic adenoma, but 29% and 40% cumulative incidences of hypothyroidism following radioiodine treatment. Late hypothyroidism occurred after surgery for Graves' thyrotoxicosis, and in all groups treated with radioiodine. Thus it is advisable that all patients with Graves' thyrotoxicosis, regardless of treatment, and all patients with toxic multinodular goitre or solitary toxic adenoma treated with radioiodine, should be followed up for many years, and probably for life. 
Intraoperative duplex sonography during renal artery reconstruction. To assess renal duplex sonography as an intraoperative study to detect technical defects during repair, 57 renal artery reconstructions in 35 patients were studied. Sixteen men and 19 women (mean age, 62 years) underwent unilateral (13 patients) or bilateral (22 patients) renal artery repair to 57 kidneys. Methods of repair included aortorenal bypass grafting in 29 cases (20 saphenous vein, 5 polytetrafluoroethylene, 4 Dacron), reimplantation in 7, transrenal thromboendarterectomy with patch angioplasty in 13, and transaortic extraction thromboendarterectomy in 8. Branch renal artery repair was required in six cases (five in vivo, one ex vivo). Fourteen patients had combined aortic replacement (11 patients: 8 abdominal aortic aneurysms, 3 aortic occlusions) or visceral artery reconstruction (three patients: three superior mesenteric artery thromboendarterectomies, one inferior mesenteric artery thromboendarterectomy). Intraoperative renal duplex sonography (mean scan time, 4.5 minutes) was complete in 56 of 57 repairs (98%), and renal duplex sonography was normal in 44 repairs (77%). Overall, B-scan defects were present in 13 repairs (23%). Six of these (11%) were defined as major B-scan defects by Doppler spectra with focal increases in peak systolic velocity greater than or equal to 2.0 meters/sec (major defect, mean renal artery peak systolic velocity, 3.1 m/sec), which prompted immediate operative revision. Seven B-scan defects were defined as minor by Doppler spectra (minor defect, mean renal artery, peak systolic velocity, 0.7 m/sec) and were not revised. Postoperative evaluation (range, 1 to 22 months; mean follow-up, 12.4 months) of 55 renal artery repairs in 34 operative survivors (surface renal duplex sonography, 33 patients; renal angiography, 9 patients) demonstrated 42/43 renal artery repairs with normal intraoperative renal duplex sonography, and 6/6 repairs with minor B-scan defects were patent and free of critical stenosis. Of the 6 renal artery revisions prompted by major B-scan defects, 4 remained patent, 1 stenosed, and 1 occluded. Our experience suggests that intraoperative renal duplex sonography during renal artery repair provides valuable anatomic and physiologic information. Renal artery repairs with normal renal duplex sonography and minor B-scan defects without Doppler spectral changes demonstrated 98% patency without critical stenosis at 12.4 months of mean follow-up. However, major B-scan defects defined by a focal increase in renal artery peak systolic velocity should be considered for immediate correction. 
Circumvention of multi-drug resistance in human kidney and kidney carcinoma in vitro. This report investigated whether the calmodulin inhibitor, trifluoperazine, can circumvent multi-drug resistance both in primary tissue cultures of human kidney and kidney carcinoma. For detection of inherent multi-drug resistance, the expression of P-glycoprotein was determined by immunofluorescence and immunocytochemistry using the monoclonal antibody C219. For detection of doxorubicin resistance and reversal of this resistance by trifluoperazine, the incorporation of nucleic acid precursor was measured after addition of doxorubicin and trifluoperazine, respectively. Both P-glycoprotein expressing resistant normal and malignant kidney tissue cultures could be modified by trifluoperazine. However, sensitive normal kidney and kidney carcinoma cultures were little affected by trifluoperazine. Thus, circumvention of primary resistance to doxorubicin is not limited to tumor cells. This might have important implications for the use of resistance modifiers in the clinical setting. 
Noninvasive detection of functionally significant coronary artery stenoses with exercise and positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography has been employed in vivo to assess flow using N-13 (nitrogen-13) ammonia and glucose metabolism, with the glucose analog F-18 (fluorine-18) fluorodeoxyglucose. Flow metabolism mismatches in which glucose metabolism is increased with respect to flow have been used to define ischemic, but viable myocardium. The feasibility of detecting exercise-induced ischemia using this technique was explored. Eleven normal volunteers and 16 patients who had undergone coronary arteriography were studied with N-13 ammonia at rest and with bicycle exercise, and with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose in the postexercise period. Each image was divided into 16 sectors. Comparison of absolute net extractions of N-13 ammonia at rest and with exercise was not sensitive in detecting functionally significant coronary artery lesions. Myocardial uptakes of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose and exercise N-13 ammonia were normalized to the sector with the highest N-13 ammonia uptake (corresponding to the highest flow rate). The differences and ratios of these normalized uptakes were successfully used to objectively define flow metabolism mismatches and to identify functionally significant coronary artery disease. Our data suggest that exercise flow and metabolic imaging are superior to rest and exercise flow imaging, particularly in patients with prior myocardial infarctions. 
Surgical management of diffuse subaortic stenosis: an integrated approach. An integrated approach to the surgical management of diffuse subaortic stenosis has been designed to provide adequate relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction whatever the anatomical features encountered at operation. This approach was used in 22 patients with tunnel subaortic stenosis (19 patients) or diffuse hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (3 patients). The obstructive tissue was resected through an aortoseptal approach. In 18 patients, associated hypoplasia of the aortic orifice necessitated aortic valve replacement using the Konno procedure; in 4 patients with a normal-sized aortic orifice, the native aortic valve was preserved. There were two early deaths and one late death (all after a Konno operation). Long-term adequate relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction was achieved in all survivors. Operation for diffuse subaortic stenosis should be performed with two main goals: (1) to obtain complete relief of the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction by the appropriate procedure and (2) to preserve the native aortic valve whenever possible, particularly in young patients. 
Selective antibiotic prophylaxis in biliary tract operations. A prospective study of 397 patients with primary biliary operations performed for benign disease included a perioperative culture of the bile. Two main groups of patients in whom bacteria in the bile and, thus, probably increased risk postoperative infection was common, are patients undergoing emergency operation (60 per cent bacteria in the bile, as compared with 22 per cent in those with elective operations) and patients with a history of acute cholecystitis or pancreatitis, or both, or jaundice (49 per cent bacteria in the bile with a positive history as compared with 11 per cent without). The rate of infection was 2.8 per cent in high-risk groups, as compared with 0.6 per cent in patients undergoing elective operative procedures with no history of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or jaundice. Thus, antibiotics can probably be reserved for those patients who had emergency surgical treatment and for those with elective operations and a history of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or jaundice. In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis might be indicated for all patients who are 75 years of age or older, as bacteria in the bile seems to be common in this age group even without a history of the aforementioned complications. 
The Sugiura procedure for patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis. The Sugiura procedure (SP) was performed upon 27 patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (EPVT) without associated hepatic disease. There were 14 female and 13 male patients. The mean age was 28 +/- 14 years. The causes of EPVT were protein C deficiency in two; antithrombin III deficiency in one patient, a history of omphalitis in two patients, a history of pancreatitis in one patient and idiopathy in 21 patients. The SP was completed in two surgical stages in 14 patients and in one stage in nine. There was one operative death. One patient had mild postoperative encephalopathy, and two patients rebled at long term follow-up study. Actuarial survival rate was 82 per cent at five and ten years. It is concluded that the SP is a good alternative for the management of hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to EPVT. 
Malignant transformation of a Hurthle cell tumor: case report and survey of the literature. Hurthle cell carcinoma is a relatively uncommon type of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Its diagnosis has been controversial due to the difficulty in separating Hurthle cell adenoma from Hurthle cell carcinoma, thus the term Hurthle cell tumor is often used to describe both lesions. The present case of anaplastic giant-cell carcinoma in an 81-yr-old woman arose in a Hurthle cell tumor. This case illustrates the propensity of Hurthle cell tumor to undergo "malignant transformation" and argues for a more aggressive approach to such tumors. 
Pulmonary nodule: evaluation with spiral volumetric CT. Spiral volumetric computed tomography (CT) was used prospectively in 20 patients with a suspected solitary pulmonary nodule less than 1 cm in diameter on plain chest radiographs. Four additional nodules were detected with spiral CT than were detected with conventional CT. This technique required a 12-second breath hold; patient cooperation was excellent. 
Alterations in influence of granuloma-derived cytokines on fibrogenesis in the course of murine Schistosoma mansoni infection. Schistosomiasis is the main cause of hepatic fibrosis worldwide, yet its pathogenesis remains unknown. We previously reported that conditioned medium from cultures of hepatic egg granulomas (isolated from mice acutely infected with Schistosoma mansoni) can stimulate fibroblast proliferation and matrix production in vitro. We have proposed that initiation of hepatic fibrosis in this infection might be under the control of granuloma-derived cytokines. We now report that conditioned medium from cultures of schistosomal egg granulomas isolated from liver of chronically infected mice has reduced fibrogenic activity compared with medium from cultures of granulomas obtained from more acutely infected mice. In related studies, we adoptively transferred splenocytes from infected mice and examined the fibrogenic activity in culture supernatants of hepatic egg granulomas isolated from the recipients. Those prepared from recipients of splenocytes from chronically infected mice contained substantially less fibrogenic activity than did those from recipients of splenocytes of acutely infected mice. These findings suggest that the fibrogenic influence of schistosomal egg granuloma products decreases during the course of chronic murine S. mansoni infection. Furthermore, our preliminary findings suggest that immunoregulatory cells may be responsible for the down-regulation of this influence. Previous observations indicating that in murine schistosomiasis hepatic collagen and hyaluronate synthesis and deposition are elevated in acute but not chronic infection might be explained on the basis of our observations. 
HBxAg in the liver from carrier patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 110 cases of chronic hepatitis and 108 cases of cirrhosis were stained for HBxAg by the avidin-biotin complex technique using specific antisera made against full-length HBxAg polypeptide or derived synthetic peptides. These tissues were also stained for the HBsAg and HBcAg by the peroxidase-anti-peroxidase method. Among patients with chronic hepatitis, 86% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 60% were surface antigen positive and 32% were core antigen positive. Among patients with cirrhosis, 97% were HBsAg positive in liver cells, 72% were surface antigen positive and 17% were positive for core antigen. Staining specificity was demonstrated, in part, by using preimmune sera in the place of primary antibody, by blocking of the primary antibody with the appropriate antigen before assay and by testing uninfected liver controls. The persistence and high frequency of HBxAg in liver cells from patients with chronic liver disease suggest that it may play one or more important roles in the pathogenesis of chronic infection. It is possible that detection of HBxAg in the liver could be an additional new diagnostic marker for hepatitis B virus infection. However, the function(s) of HBxAg in the pathogenesis of the chronic liver disease, if any, remains to be explained. 
Use of parenteral medium-chain triglyceride emulsion for maintaining seizure control in a 5-year-old girl with intractable diarrhea. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are an important component of an enteral ketogenic diet for seizure control. Previously, it was difficult to maintain ketosis when parenteral (iv) nutrition therapy was necessary. The use of iv MCT in a 5-year-old girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who had diarrhea and dehydration is reported. Conventional 20% iv fat emulsion (long-chain triglycerides, LCT) and dextrose free hyperalimentation (HAL) in a 4:1 ketogenic ratio did not maintain adequate ketosis during bowel rest. Compassionate use of iv MCT (Clintec Nutrition) infused as a 70:30 MCT/LCT ratio plus HAL maintained moderate ketosis. Seizures were well controlled during the iv MCT regimen, which allowed normal daily functioning. Complications included abnormal liver function tests and severe iron deficiency anemia of unknown etiology. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels increased to 1717 mg/dl and 614 mg/dl, respectively, but decreased with a reduction of lipid infusion and use of an antihyperlipemic drug. Nutritional status was maintained. In this case, iv MCT proved to be a relatively safe and effective short-term method of continuing parenteral nutrition while maintaining ketosis for seizure control. 
Differential effects of gallium nitrate on proliferation of brain tumor cells in vitro. Gallium nitrate possesses antineoplastic activity against certain solid tumors; however, no studies exist regarding the effect of this metal on brain tumor cell proliferation. Several human brain tumor and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines were incubated with increasing concentrations of gallium nitrate and cell proliferation was assessed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The growth of medulloblastoma 324, rhabdomyosarcoma TE671, and RD cells was markedly inhibited by gallium nitrate, while glioblastoma cell growth was only moderately inhibited (U373 cells) or actually stimulated (U87 cells). Gallium inhibited the cellular uptake of 59Fe; however, this block in 59Fe uptake was variable and closely paralleled the inhibitory effects of gallium on cell growth. Intracellularly, gallium may interfere with DNA synthesis by inhibiting ribonucleotide reductase. Such effects may be of relevance in the treatment of brain tumors with this metal. 
Mixed cryoglobulinemia associated with chronic Q-fever. A 41-year-old woman who presented with purpura, glomerulonephritis and mixed cryoglobulinemia was found subsequently to have developed chronic Q-fever. Since Q-fever is a frequent cause of culture negative endocarditis in some endemic areas, the diagnosis of Q-fever endocarditis should be considered in patients presenting with mixed cryoglobulinemia of unknown cause. 
Suppressive effect of SUN1165 on supraventricular tachycardia. The electrophysiologic properties of SUN1165 and its suppressive effect on supraventricular tachycardia were assessed in 14 patients, nine with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) and five with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). This new agent prolonged the PR interval and QRS duration but did not alter the QT interval or the corrected QT interval. It did not alter the sinus cycle length or sinus node recovery time. The drug prolonged the AH interval, HV interval, and intraatrial conduction time but did not change the effective refractory periods of the right atrium or right ventricle. SUN1165 prevented the induction of tachycardia in six of nine patients with AVRT by a complete retrograde block of the accessory pathway and prevented AVNRT in four of five patients by a complete retrograde block of the fast atrioventricular nodal pathway as well. We conclude that SUN1165 is very effective in preventing AVRT or AVNRT. Larger studies with more patients are warranted. 
Family history in patients with transient ischemic attacks. To determine the influence of family history on vascular disease, we surveyed hospital patients discharged with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack. Of 117 respondents, 81 knew their family history for myocardial infarction and 81 knew their family history for stroke. Of 83 responding 43 reported a personal history of myocardial infarction, and of 85 responding 66 reported a personal history of stroke. As expected, there was an association between positive family and personal histories of myocardial infarction in younger (aged less than 70 years) patients (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.014). This association was reversed for stroke (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.017). Older (aged greater than or equal to 70 years) patients had a stronger association between positive family and personal histories of stroke; 14 (74%) of 19 older patients with a positive personal history of stroke had a positive family history of stroke. The reason for this reversal in the relation between family and personal histories of stroke compared with myocardial infarction may relate to the older age at onset of most strokes, differing stroke subtypes in older age groups, or lower rates of fatal myocardial infarction. This study suggests that familial factors may be important in some subtypes of cerebrovascular disease. Familial effects may be different in vascular diseases of the heart and brain. 
Interleukin-6 secreting human pituitary adenomas in vitro. Interleukin-6 was found to be secreted from seven out of ten human pituitary tumours cultured in vitro. These tumours included prolactin-secreting, growth hormone-secreting and clinically non-functioning adenomas. The amount of Interleukin-6 secreted was variable from 58 to 10,000 units per ml. in medium removed after a four-day incubation under basal conditions. Four tumours secreted IL-6 in excess of 500U/ml, three of which were clinically non-functioning, but each secreted follicle stimulating hormone in vitro. This is the first report of a cytokine growth factor being released basally by human pituitary tumours. 
Pancreatoduodenal carcinoma: a clinicopathologic study of 304 patients and immunohistochemical observation for CEA and CA19-9. A total of 304 patients with pancreatoduodenal carcinoma were studied clinicopathologically and immunohistochemically in order to clarify features of carcinoma of four different sites of origin; carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater (Am), the distal common bile duct (DCBD), the head of the pancreas (PH), and the extra-ampullary duodenum (Du). The mean greatest diameter of 87 PH was 3.5 cm compared with 2.7 cm of 149 Am and 2.7 cm of DCBD. Histopathologically, 40% of Am were papillary adenocarcinoma, while about half of DCBD, PH and Du were tubular adenocarcinoma. PH invaded lymphatic (85%), vascular (62%), and perineural (95%) spaces and metastasized lymph nodes (72%) more frequently than Am (77%, 35%, 24%, 50%), DCBD (47%, 61%, 65%, 45%), and Du (76%, 29%, 35%, 65%), respectively. More than 50% of PH invaded the resected margins, whereas in only 2% of Am, the surgical margins were affected by malignant cells. Immunohistochemically, PH was more frequently positive for both carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (98%) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 (91%) than Am (83%, 62%), DCBD (94%, 58%), and Du (56%, 11%), respectively. The stromal staining type of CEA and CA 19-9 was more frequently seen in PH (27%, 44%) than in Am (9%, 31%), DCBD (11%, 8%) and Du (0%, 0%), showing a more dedifferentiated nature of PH. The cumulative 3-year survival rate of 87 patients with PH (15%) was worse than that of 149 with Am (42%, P less than 0.001), of 51 with DCBD (25%) and of 17 with Du (58%, P less than 0.001). The survival curve of 87 with PH was worse than that of 51 with DCBD, of 149 with Am (P less than 0.001) and of 17 with Du (P less than 0.001). Cox regression analysis, using eleven profound prognostic variables, revealed that venous invasion, perineural infiltration, surgical margin, and histopathologic type were profound prognostic factors. Pancreatic carcinoma has a more dedifferentiated histopathologic nature, showing a more aggressive growth and fares worse than Am, DCBD, and Du. 
A 21-year experience with major hemorrhage after percutaneous liver biopsy Nine thousand two hundred twelve liver biopsies were performed according to a defined protocol, and data were prospectively recorded to identify risk factors for major bleeding. There were 10 fatal and 22 nonfatal hemorrhages (0.11% and 0.24%, respectively). By comparison with a control group that did not hemorrhage, malignancy, age, sex, and the number of passes were the only predictable risk factors. The risk of fatal hemorrhage in patients with malignancy is estimated to be 0.4%; for nonfatal hemorrhage, 0.57%. In patients undergoing liver biopsy for nonmalignant disease, the risks are 0.04% and 0.16%, respectively. 
Skeletal actin mRNA increases in the human heart during ontogenic development and is the major isoform of control and failing adult hearts. Expression of the two sarcomeric actins, alpha-skeletal and alpha-cardiac, is regulated in the rodent heart in response to developmental, hormonal, and hemodynamic stimuli. Little is known in man, except that both isogenes were found to be coexpressed in three adult ventricles. In this report, we investigated the isoactin mRNA composition in ventricles from 21 control patients (4 fetal, 5 juvenile, 12 adult) and from 15 patients undergoing cardiac transplantation (5 idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathies, 5 ischemic myopathies with myocardial infarcts, 5 diverse etiologies) by two different and complementary techniques: RNA dot blot analysis with specific cDNA probes, and primer extensions with an oligonucleotide common to alpha-cardiac and alpha-skeletal actins. In the case of dot blot analysis, quantification of each isoform was performed by using as standards RNA transcripts obtained from cloned human alpha-actin sequences, and the total amount of sarcomeric actin mRNA was evaluated as a function of total poly(A+)RNA. We found that both isogenes are always coexpressed, and that the isoactin pattern changes during development. In utero and in neonatal hearts, alpha-skeletal actin mRNA represents less than or equal to 20% of sarcomeric actins, it increases to 48 +/- 6% during the first decade after birth and becomes the predominant isoform of adult hearts (60.4 +/- 8.5%). The 15 adult failing hearts exhibited the same isoactin pattern as the control ones (62.84 +/- 11.06%), and there was no difference in expression between patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemic heart disease. These observations demonstrate that cardiac development in man, in contrast to rodent heart, is characterized by an up-regulation of the skeletal actin gene, the expression of which does not change in hypertrophied and failing hearts, and suggest that the actin and myosin heavy chain families are independently regulated in human heart. 
Pregnancy outcome among native Indians in Saskatchewan. OBJECTIVE: To determine the difference in pregnancy outcome between native Indians and the provincial population in Saskatchewan. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data collected from all birth and death registration forms. SETTING: Saskatchewan. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of low birth weight and rates of stillbirth and of neonatal and infant death. RESULTS: The neonatal death rate was higher in the Indian population than in the provincial population during the study period; the difference between the two groups in the rate decreased markedly after 1982. The rates of stillbirth and infant death were also higher among the Indians, and the difference persisted during the study period. The incidence of low birth weight and the rate of stillbirth were highest in the youngest and oldest maternal groups in the provincial population; however, the pattern was markedly different among the Indians, teenaged mothers having the best outcomes. CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to determine the relation between maternal age and fetal outcome among native Indians. 
Possible linkage of the estrogen receptor gene to breast cancer in a family with late-onset disease. The estrogen-receptor locus is a candidate gene for inherited susceptibility to human breast cancer, particularly among families with later onset, primarily estrogen-receptor-positive tumors. For one extended family with eight patients with late-onset disease, one estrogen-receptor haplotype was consistently coinherited with breast cancer, yielding a +1.85 lod score for linkage at zero recombination. Simulation of this pedigree assuming independent inheritance of breast cancer and estrogen-receptor genotypes led to a lod score greater than or equal to 1.85 only once in 2,000 replicates. We suggest testing linkage of this gene to breast cancer in other families with late-onset disease. 
Quantitative coronary arteriographic methods in the interventional catheterization laboratory: an update and perspective. Recent research advances in the area of quantitative coronary arteriography are described with respect to their potential role in assessing the effects of interventional therapy and monitoring the restenosis process. Specific areas emphasized are the importance of quantitative arteriography and absolute measures of arterial dimension in monitoring restenosis, the development of a computerized method for measuring lesion roughness, the potential role of measuring stenosis flow reserve based on component analysis principles, limitations of direct measures of myocardial flow reserve using a digital angiographic method and cautionary notes about clinical applications of videodensitometry. The current use of radiography and quantitative measures in limiting arterial injury are briefly reviewed. Finally, a perspective is put forth on the need to develop complementary roles for endovascular echocardiography and angioscopy with existing radiographic imaging technology. 
Diuretic agents and beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension. Benzothiadiazine diuretic agents and beta-adrenergic receptor-blocking drugs are two of the main groups of drugs used to treat mild hypertension. Recently, questions have been raised about their relative efficacy in preventing morbidity and mortality from vascular disease in addition to their effect on lowering blood pressure. Attention has been focused on the unfavorable metabolic effects of diuretic drugs and the proven value of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. Four randomized controlled trials comparing drugs in these two classes have been published: the Medical Research Council trial, the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial, and the Metoprolol Atherosclerosis Prevention in Hypertension study. These trials, especially that of the Medical Research Council, have raised some questions about the relative efficacy of these two classes of drugs in preventing stroke in smokers and nonsmokers. Overall, there is little evidence of a reduction in morbidity and mortality after myocardial infarction. The predicted advantage of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade over diuretic therapy has not been realized although there are sufficient hints of a differential benefit to encourage the performance of further trials. 
Stenting of coronary arteries: has a modern Pandora's box been opened? Interventional cardiology has recently witnessed the growth of several alternatives to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, including coronary stenting. Although stenting appears to be useful in treating abrupt closure after coronary angioplasty, its effectiveness in limiting the complex processes responsible for late restenosis is much less certain. Pathologic examination of stented human saphenous bypass grafts shows extensive deposits of platelets, fibrin and leukocytes along the stent wires within the 1st week and formation of a neointima of variable thickness after 3 months without evidence of foreign body reaction. The long-term effects of continuous barotrauma induced by the expanded stent remain unknown. It is difficult to assess the relative merits of the new devices, but stenting has several theoretic advantages. It seems less disruptive to the underlying architecture of the vessel wall and enjoys favorable theoretic and effective expansion ratios. Wide-spread clinical acceptance for stenting will depend on demonstrating that its safety, efficacy and cost efficiency are superior to those of balloon angioplasty. 
Magnetic resonance imaging and 31P spectroscopy of an interictal cortical spike focus in the rat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has proven to be an effective noninvasive technique for identifying lesions in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. It has also been suggested that MRI may be sensitive to transient functional or metabolic changes in brain tissue. Increased brain electrical activity as monitored by electroencephalography causes changes in cerebral metabolism that may be responsible for focal or regional alterations in signal in the MRI of some patients. To test this hypotheses, experimental interictal cortical foci were produced in rats by topical application of penicillin to one hemisphere of the brain. In vivo MRI and phosphorous-31 (31P) spectroscopy of the focal and contralateral hemifield were performed in a 30-cm bore 1.89-T Bruker MSL system. 31P spectroscopy revealed no quantifiable differences in pH or in phosphocreatinine and ATP levels between the focal area and the contralateral hemisphere or between experimental and saline-treated control animals. There were also no differences in proton MRI. Similar areas of prolonged T2 were found near the cortex and in the deeper parenchyma in 55% of the experimental animals and 50% of the controls. These results suggest that the electrical activity from an interictal cortical spike focus is not severe enough to perturb cerebral metabolism sufficiently to be detectable by 31P spectroscopy or proton imaging techniques. 
Antisense-mediated reduction in thrombospondin reverses the malignant phenotype of a human squamous carcinoma. Thrombospondin (TSP) is a trimeric glycoprotein which is synthesized and incorporated into the extracellular matrix by a wide variety of cells. TSP is involved in a number of cellular processes which govern tumor cell behavior including mitogenesis, attachment, migration, and differentiation. To directly assess the role of TSP in tumor cell growth and spread, a human squamous carcinoma cell line, with high TSP production and an invasive phenotype, was transfected with a TSP cDNA antisense expression vector. Five unique transfected clones were obtained with reduced TSP production. Expression of the transfected antisense sequence in these clones was verified by a ribonuclease protection assay. These clones demonstrated reduced growth rates in vitro when compared with a vector transfected control. After subcutaneous inoculation into athymic mice, the antisense clones formed either no tumors or tumors that were slow growing and highly differentiated. This contrasted with the vector-transfected clone which produced poorly differentiated, rapidly growing, invasive tumors. Our results argue in favor of a direct role for TSP in determining the malignant phenotype of certain human tumors. 
Cardiac transplantation. How recipients are selected. Your patients with heart disease may ask about transplantation. Those who are potential candidates need a physician who knows enough about the selection system to get them into it. For other patients, an explanation of why the procedure is contraindicated in their case can help them refocus on compliance with recommended therapy. The authors discuss the principles of recipient selection. 
Mucosal dysplasia and DNA content in ulcerative colitis patients with ileorectal anastomosis. Follow-up study in a defined patient group. In a follow-up study of an epidemiologically defined patient group comprising 1,274 patients with ulcerative colitis diagnosed in Stockholm County during 1955-1979, 55 patients had undergone colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis (IRA). Nine of these were found to have Crohn's disease after histopathologic review of the colectomy specimens. Of the 46 patients with ulcerative colitis remaining for evaluation, two died postoperatively. Twenty-five patients were subsequently reoperated with rectal excision owing to intractable inflammatory activity (n = 22, one postoperative death) or owing to dysplasia (n = 3). Of 19 patients with their IRA still intact at time of follow-up, 15 patients (median disease duration 23 years) had a flexible sigmoidoscopy with multiple biopsies performed. The average length of the remaining rectum and sigmoid colon was 26 cm. No patient had findings of dysplasia, carcinoma, or DNA aneuploidy. None of the four remaining patients had developed dysplasia or carcinoma at the time of the latest regular rigid sigmoidoscopy. The risk of malignant transformation in this selected group of patients with ulcerative colitis operated upon with colectomy and IRA derived from an epidemiologically defined population seems to be low. 
Short and long term outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in unstable versus stable angina pectoris: a report of the 1985-1986 NHLBI PTCA Registry. In a cohort of 1,720 consecutive patients from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Registry (August 1985-May 1986), we compared 768 patients (45%) with stable angina and 952 patients (55%) with unstable angina pectoris. Unstable angina patients exhibited at least one of the following characteristics: new onset angina, rapidly progressing angina, angina at rest, angina refractory to medication, variant angina, acute coronary insufficiency, or angina recurring shortly after an acute myocardial infarct. The distribution of single- and multi-vessel disease was similar among stable and unstable angina patients; multi-vessel disease predominated. Average severity of stenosis and incidence of tubular and diffuse stenosis morphology were higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Patient success rates were similar in stable and unstable patients. However, on a per lesion basis, overall angiographic success rate and average reduction of severity of stenosis in successfully dilated lesions were significantly higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Incidence of major patient complications (p less than 0.01) and of emergency coronary bypass surgery (p less than 0.05) were also higher in patients with unstable angina but consistent with their more precarious clinical condition and stenosis morphology. During a two year follow-up, the cumulative distributions of death, myocardial infarct, repeat PTCA, and coronary bypass surgery were not significantly different in patients with stable angina compared to patients with unstable angina. Comparison of the current PTCA Registry cohort with the cases reported in the 1979-1982 Registry revealed a 19% higher success rate for both stable and unstable angina patients. Major complication rates decreased between time periods for stable but not for unstable angina patients. Incidence of emergency bypass surgery decreased more for stable than for unstable angina patients. Coronary angioplasty is indicated in properly selected patients with unstable angina and both single- and multi-vessel coronary disease. 
Reversal of nonresponders and postexposure prophylaxis by intradermal hepatitis B vaccination in Japanese medical personnel. Thirty-one Japanese nonresponders to subcutaneous hepatitis B vaccination and 15 medical personnel who were accidentally exposed to specimens positive for hepatitis B e antigen and were given hepatitis B immunoglobulin were intradermally immunized with 5 micrograms of plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine every 2 weeks until delayed type hypersensitivity skin reaction to hepatitis B surface antigen became positive. Thirty (97%) of the 31 nonresponders developed delayed type hypersensitivity skin reactions to hepatitis B surface antigen after 2.3 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SD) revaccinations. Twenty-nine (94%) of the 31 nonresponders had anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody levels greater than 10 IU/L. The immunoglobulin subclass of the antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen was mainly IgG1. After 1 year, 23 (74%) of the 31 nonresponders continued to have anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibody levels greater than 10 IU/L. Persons accidentally exposed to specimens positive for hepatitis B e antigen developed delayed type hypersensitivity skin reactions to hepatitis B surface antigen following 3.1 +/- 1.1 revaccinations. None developed clinical hepatitis. There was no production of anti-hepatitis B core antigen antibody 1 year after exposure, indicating that protection was 100%. Intradermal hepatitis B vaccination is useful in reversing nonresponsiveness to hepatitis B surface antigen and for prophylaxis after exposure. 
The value of bupivicaine hip injection in the differentiation of coxarthrosis from lower extremity neuropathy. A series of 18 consecutive patients with roentgenographically proven osteoarthrosis (osteoarthritis, OA) of the hip and spine were evaluated because of concomitant lower extremity pain below the knee. To determine whether the leg symptoms were coxalgic or neuropathic, intraarticular hip bupivicaine was injected as a provocative test. This test allowed correct identification of the source of the pain with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 100%, and an efficiency of 88%. This office test also provides significant savings in terms of diagnostic tests and patient discomfort. 
Diagnostic imaging in puerperal febrile morbidity. This retrospective study was conducted to assess the value of imaging in patients with refractory puerperal febrile morbidity. During a 36-month period, 31 patients were referred for ultrasound and/or computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging because of postpartum fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy of at least 72 hours' duration. Hematomas were identified in 11 women. Abscesses were diagnosed in seven patients, ovarian venous thrombosis in two, vesicouterine fistula in one, small-bowel obstruction in one, and a subcutaneous seroma in one. Twenty-one women had endomyometritis, 13 of whom also had other extrauterine abnormalities (abscess in six, hematoma in four, and ovarian venous thrombosis, vesicouterine fistula, and small-bowel obstruction in one each). Retained placental tissue was found in two women with endomyometritis. Only two subjects had negative imaging studies. In most patients, imaging led to definitive diagnosis and specific therapeutic measures resulting in resolution of the febrile morbidity. Our experience suggests that these imaging techniques may be helpful in evaluating puerperal fever. 
Eosinophil-rich, granulomatous inflammatory response to Plasmodium berghei hepatic schizonts in nonimmunized rats is age-related. Inflammatory responses to Plasmodium hepatic schizonts within the livers of non-immunized animals have long been assumed to be initiated only after the parasites have matured and begun to burst. However, recent reports of inflammatory responses around hepatic schizonts suggested a re-examination of this issue. We injected Norway-Brown rats of various ages intravenously with Plasmodium berghei sporozoites and studied subsequent liver histopathology. We found that the ability of these rats to mount an inflammatory response is age-dependent. Young (4 weeks) rats had weak inflammatory responses against hepatic schizonts, whereas older (8-10 weeks) rats mounted a strong response. Older rats had many granulomatous reactions within the liver; eosinophils represented a pioneer component of the cellular infiltrate. There was a reduction in the numbers of surviving hepatic schizonts in the older rats, suggesting that these granulomatous and eosinophilic reactions had effectively destroyed some of the hepatic schizonts. We found clear evidence of inflammatory cells (eosinophils) infiltrating hepatic schizonts as early as 40 hours post-injection with sporozoites, a time well before any hepatic schizonts could have burst within the liver. This presents histological evidence that inflammatory cells can recognize and infiltrate intact hepatocytes containing schizonts in immunologically naive animals. 
A prospective study of maturity-onset diabetes mellitus and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in women. We examined the relationship of maturity-onset clinical diabetes mellitus with the subsequent incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke, total cardiovascular mortality, and all-cause mortality in a cohort of 116,177 US women who were 30 to 55 years of age and free of known coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer in 1976. During 8 years of follow-up (889 255 person-years), we identified 338 nonfatal myocardial infarctions, 111 coronary deaths, 259 strokes, 238 cardiovascular deaths, and 1349 deaths from all causes. Diabetes was associated with a markedly increased risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal coronary heart disease (age-adjusted relative risk [RR] = 6.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.3 to 8.4), ischemic stroke (RR = 5.4; 95% CI, 3.3 to 9.0), total cardiovascular mortality (RR = 6.3; 95% CI, 4.6 to 8.6), and all-cause mortality (RR = 3.0; 95% CI, 2.5 to 3.7). A major independent effect of diabetes persisted in multivariate analyses after simultaneous control for other known coronary risk factors (for these end points, RR [95% CI] = 3.1 [2.3 to 4.2], 3.0 [1.6 to 5.7], 3.0 [1.9 to 4.8], and 1.9 [1.4 to 2.4], respectively). The absolute excess coronary risk due to diabetes was greater in the presence of other risk factors, including cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. These prospective data indicate that maturity-onset clinical diabetes is a strong determinant of coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and cardiovascular mortality among middle-aged women. The adverse effect of diabetes is amplified in the presence of other cardiovascular risk factors, many of which are modifiable. 
Fetal and neonatal effects of treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in pregnancy. We conducted a systematic search of the world literature up to January 1, 1990 on the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for treatment of hypertension during pregnancy. A total of 25 publications reported 85 pregnancies in 81 women, including three twin pregnancies. Captopril had been used in 49, enalapril in 35, and both drugs in one of these pregnancies. The number of unbiased data are too limited to permit firm conclusions on teratogenicity, if any, of these agents. Contrary to earlier suggestions, we found no evidence that the use of these agents increases the likelihood of low weight for gestational age, respiratory distress syndrome, and/or persistent ductus arteriosus. Use of these agents in pregnancy can cause severe disturbance of fetal and neonatal renal function, such as oligohydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, and long-lasting neonatal anuria. Although the true incidence of these perinatal problems cannot be derived from the type of data hitherto available, there are strong suggestions that renal dysfunction is more common with the use of enalapril than with captopril. The frequency of serious perinatal complications is high enough to warrant extreme reluctance in prescribing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors during pregnancy. 
Respiratory symptoms in Indian women using domestic cooking fuels. The effect of domestic cooking fuels producing various respiratory symptoms was studied in 3,701 women. Of these, 3,608 were nonsmoking women who used four different types of cooking fuels: biomass, LPG, kerosene, and mixed fuels. The overall respiratory symptoms were observed in 13 percent of patients. Mixed fuel users experienced more respiratory symptoms (16.7 percent), followed by biomass (12.6 percent), stove (11.4 percent), and LPG (9.9 percent). Chronic bronchitis in chulla users was significantly higher than that in kerosene and LPG users (p less than 0.05). Dyspnea and postnasal drip were significantly higher in the women using mixed fuels. Smoking women who are also exposed to cooking fuels experienced respiratory symptoms more often than nonsmokers (33.3 percent vs 13 percent). 
Thrombolytic therapy in acute MI. Weighing the risks and benefits. The underlying cause of acute myocardial infarction can now be effectively treated with thrombolytic agents, thereby increasing myocardial salvage and reducing mortality. Clinicians should always be aware of the risk-to-benefit ratio in treating patients with thrombolytic agents and treat each patient on an individual basis. 
Specific release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IFN-gamma by human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes after autologous tumor stimulation. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) have been cultured from a variety of human tumors, and some melanoma TIL have demonstrated specific, MHC-restricted recognition of autologous tumor in short term lysis assays. The current study investigates cytokine release by TIL as an indicator of specific tumor recognition. We have identified two of four melanoma and one of seven breast carcinoma TIL cultures that specifically release granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma after autologous tumor stimulation. The other cultures either do not secrete cytokine or secrete cytokine in a nonspecific fashion. The amount of specific cytokine released is directly related to the number of TIL and stimulating tumor cells. Studies of TIL, from two melanoma patients, separated into CD4+ and CD8+ populations revealed that CD8+ cells were responsible for virtually all of the specific cytokine secretion, although both populations released cytokines when activated by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody. Specific cytokine release by CD8+ TIL was inhibited by anti-MHC class I mAb. Specific cytokine release was also detected from a CD4+ breast cancer TIL culture, and this was inhibited by anti-MHC class II mAb. The clinical significance of this specific mode of immune antitumor reactivity is currently under investigation. 
Study of 156 cases of polyhydramnios and congenital malformations in a series of 118,265 consecutive births. Polyhydramnios associated with congenital anomalies was studied over nine years in 118,265 consecutive pregnancies. The prevalence of this association was 1.32% (156 cases). A case-control study allowed the examination of genetic and environmental factors for the origin of polyhydramnios associated with congenital malformations. Diagnosis of polyhydramnios associated with congenital malformations was performed prenatally in 41% of the cases; 16% of the infants were stillborn. Fifty-five percent of the cases had more than one malformation, 13.4% of them had a chromosomal aberration, and 32% had multiple malformations that do not constitute a syndrome. There was an increase of consanguinity in the parents of our patients. The incidence of polyhydramnios and congenital anomalies in first-degree relatives was 3.8%, and first-degree relatives had more malformations than the controls had (8.3% vs 3.2%). Our study demonstrated the low capacity of a general prenatal screening program because the diagnosis of malformations associated with polyhydramnios was made in only 41% of the cases and only six of 21 chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed prenatally. We recommend the use of fetal chromosome analysis and careful ultrasonographic examination in every pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios. 
Mortality in acute cerebral infarction in young adults--a ten-year experience. We reviewed the one-month mortality among 213 patients aged fifteen to forty-five years (mean thirty-five) with acute cerebral infarction (CI) evaluated during the period July 1, 1977, to February 1, 1988. Atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) was diagnosed in 59 (27.7%) patients, 53 (24.9%) had non-atherosclerotic vasculopathies (NAV); 46 (21.6%) had cardioembolic infarcts (CEI). Hematologically related disorders were diagnosed in 30 (14.1%) patients; the cause of CI could not be established in 25 (11.7%) patients. Fourteen patients (9 men, 5 women, mean age 34.8 years), (6.6%) died within thirty days of their CI: 7 had CEI (7/46,15.2%); 4 had ACI (4/59, 6.7%); and 3 had NAV (3/53, 5.6%). Our data suggest that young patients with acute CI have a thirty-day mortality rate lower than older patients. Deaths were most common in patients with CEI. Brain edema and herniation accounted for 6 (43%) of the deaths. 
Effect of cell wall skeleton and monophosphoryl lipid A adjuvant on the immunogenicity of a murine B16 melanoma vaccine. We examined the effect of a new adjuvant consisting of purified mycobacterial cell wall skeleton (CWS) and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) on the immunogenicity of a murine melanoma vaccine. C57BL/6 mice were immunized to partially purified B16 melanoma vaccine given alone or together with different dose levels of adjuvant, or with saline or adjuvant alone. Humoral response, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), in vitro cytotoxicity, and tumor-protective immunity to melanoma were measured following three biweekly immunizations. The adjuvant potentiated the antibody response to some, but not all, melanoma antigens in a dose-dependent fashion. The adjuvant also potentiated cellular immunity as measured by in vitro cytotoxicity assays. No potentiation of tumor-protective immunity was detected. In comparison to Freund's complete adjuvant, cell wall skeleton plus monophosphoryl lipid A (CWS:MPL) induced fewer cutaneous toxic effects and stronger antibody and DTH responses but resulted in no greater in vitro cytotoxicity or tumor-protective immunity. Thus, the adjuvant had a selective and dose-dependent effect on humoral responses to vaccine immunization but did not potentiate a tumor-protective immunity to B16 melanoma. 
Histopathologic comparison between human oral squamous cell carcinomas and their xenografts in nude mice. Tumor portions were obtained from 11 oral squamous cell carcinomas and used to produce tumors in a xenogeneic gnotobiotic nude mouse model system. The tumors that developed were examined histologically. The cellular features and tumor growth patterns were compared between the original oral squamous cell carcinoma (T0) and the tumor that developed in the xenogeneic host (T1). The T1 tumors were more highly differentiated in comparison with the T0 tumors. The T1 tumors exhibited less cellular pleomorphism and a more uniform pattern of stratification. The cells in the T1 tumors exhibited an increased mitotic index but did not contain abnormal mitoses. The T1 tumors usually exhibited nodular growth patterns rather than the infiltrating pattern exhibited by the parenchyma of the T0 tumors. The desmoplastic reaction was markedly reduced in the T1 tumors. The results indicated that the gnotobiotic nude mouse model system either selects for or induces a more differentiated pattern of tumor growth than that found in the original human oral squamous cell carcinomas. 
Potential errors in pulse oximetry. II. Effects of changes in saturation and signal quality. The published studies of pulse oximeter performance under conditions of normal, high and low saturation, exercise, poor signal quality and cardiac arrhythmia are reviewed. Most pulse oximeters have an absolute mean error of less than 2% at normal saturation and perfusion; two-thirds have a standard deviation (SD) of less than 2%, and the remainder an SD of less than 3%. Some pulse oximeters tend to read 100% with fractional saturations of 97-98%. Pulse oximeters may be suitable hyperoxic alarms for neonates if the alarm limit chosen is directly validated for each device. Pulse oximeters are poorly calibrated at low saturations and are generally less accurate and less precise than at normal saturations; nearly 30% of 244 values reviewed were in error by more than 5% at saturations of less than 80%. Ear, nose and forehead probes respond more rapidly to rapid desaturation than finger probes, but are generally less accurate and less precise. Ear oximetry may be inaccurate during exercise. Low signal quality can result in failure to present a saturation reading, but data given with low signal quality warning messages are generally no less accurate than those without. Cardiac arrhythmias do not decrease accuracy of pulse oximeters so long as saturation readings are steady. 
Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of proximal subclavian artery stenosis after left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery bypass surgery. A patient is described who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, through a brachial approach, of a high grade stenosis at the proximal portion of the left subclavian artery 1.5 years after coronary artery bypass grafting including left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery anastomosis. Symptoms of class IV angina, vertebrobasilar insufficiency and occupational arm claudication that developed after bypass surgery were promptly relieved after balloon dilation. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery can be performed safely and provides an alternative to carotid-subclavian or axillary-axillary bypass surgery for treatment of internal mammary artery graft malfunction. 
An analysis of the retrolabyrinthine vs. the retrosigmoid vestibular nerve section. Vestibular neurectomy is gaining widespread acceptance as a primary means of controlling medically refractory vertigo. However, debate continues over the adequacy of vestibular neurectomy within the cerebellopontine angle, long-term control, and the most appropriate surgical approach. To address these issues, we retrospectively reviewed 118 patients who underwent vestibular neurectomy between October 1984 and January 1988. Forty-two patients who underwent a retrolabyrinthine approach and 44 patients who underwent a retrosigmoid approach completed a written questionnaire and provided a recent audiogram. According to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, complete or substantial vertigo control was achieved and maintained in 95% of patients in both surgical groups. Hearing, tinnitus, and fullness results over the long term are variable. The advantages and disadvantages of the various vestibular neurectomy approaches will be detailed. On review of our results and surgical experience, we now prefer the retrosigmoid approach. 
Surgical repair of rectovaginal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease: transvaginal approach. The surgical management of rectovaginal fistulas complicating Crohn's disease has been associated with unacceptably high failure rates. We sought to modify the available surgical techniques to provide a solution to this challenging problem. Between December 1983 and January 1990, 14 patients with Crohn's disease underwent repair of a rectovaginal fistula. A modified transvaginal approach was employed by the authors. A diverting loop ileostomy was performed on all patients, either as the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula. The fistula was completely eradicated in 13 of the 14 women and did not recur during the mean follow-up period of 55.0 months (range, 3-77 months). Intestinal continuity was reestablished in these 13 patients within 6 months after the initial fistula repair. One patient with a very low-lying fistula constituted our only failure. We have found the transvaginal method preferable to the transanal approach because of the relative ease in raising the vaginal flap as compared with a flap of fibrotic and inflamed anorectal mucosa. On the basis of this study, we conclude that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulas secondary to Crohn's disease. 
Effect of ischemia on protein synthesis in the septic liver. The effect of ischemia on hepatic protein synthesis during sepsis is not known, but is of clinical relevance, since hepatic blood flow decreases during the late phase of sepsis. In this study, synthesis of acute-phase proteins was measured in perfused livers of rats 16 hours after sham operation or cecal ligation and puncture. Livers from each group had 45 minutes of complete ischemia or control perfusion. Protein synthesis was measured during two hour perfusion after the ischemia or control period, by determining incorporation of 3H-leucine into total secreted trichloracetic acid precipitated proteins, immunoprecipitated complement component C3 and albumin and phosphotungstenate-precipitated alpha 1-acid glycoprotein. Lactate, glutamine-oxalacetic transaminase (GOT) and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) levels in the perfusate were measured during preischemic and postischemic perfusion. Tissue glutathione levels were measured at the end of the perfusion. Synthesis of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was increased by 100 per cent and albumin synthesis decreased by 46 per cent in septic livers, consistent with an acute-phase response and apparent downregulation of albumin synthesis during early sepsis. Synthesis rates were reduced by 50 to 60 per cent after ischemia in perfused livers from sham operated rats and 70 to 80 per cent in livers from septic rats. Hepatic production of interleukin-1 was not different between the groups during perfusion. GOT and GPT levels increased significantly during ischemia of both nonseptic and septic livers and rapidly returned toward baseline during reperfusion. Lactate levels were higher in perfusate of septic than of nonseptic livers before ischemia and increased further during ischemia. The results suggest that ischemia inhibits production of secreted hepatic proteins similarly in nonseptic and septic livers, but perhaps to a slightly greater extent in septic livers. 
A case of candidal umbilical granuloma. A case is reported of a 14-year-old boy with a mass arising from the umbilicus, which was a large, well-organized candidal granuloma. Cell markers showed normal numbers and distribution of peripheral T and B lymphocytes but there was no reaction to intradermal injection of Candida, suggesting a specific T-cell defect such as occurs in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. 
Invasive treatment of pancreatic fluid collections with surgical and nonsurgical methods. Pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) can be drained surgically or nonsurgically with endoscopic or radiologic techniques. To define subgroups of patients with PFC who would benefit from the new modalities, we reviewed a period (1977 to 1990) during which both surgical and nonsurgical invasive techniques were available. Patients with phlegmon or necrosis at initial diagnosis were excluded. Sixty-five patients (35 male, 30 female) underwent 1 or more drainage procedures. A mean postprocedure follow-up of 10.2 months was available for 59 patients. Initial management was nonsurgical in 80% of patients. Procedures in patients with follow-up comprised invasive nonsurgical drainage (n = 25), invasive nonsurgical drainage plus surgery (n = 22), and surgery only (n = 12). Results for each group, respectively, were: morbidity, 20%, 20%, and 24%; mortality, 8%, 5%, and 0%; and successful drainage, 92%, 82%, and 83%. The choice of management appeared to be based on etiology and radiologic characteristics. Patients with nonalcohol- and nonbiliary-associated pancreatitis without a radiographically defined wall were more common in the invasive nonsurgical group and were successfully treated without surgery. Nonsurgical invasive techniques are efficacious in the treatment of PFC in this subgroup of patients. 
Haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome: false positive reaction with a rotavirus latex agglutination test. A stool sample from a child with haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome gave a positive reaction with the RotaScreen latex agglutination test in the absence of other evidence of rotavirus infection. When this test is performed on bloody specimens, positive reactions should be interpreted with caution and confirmed by other means. 
Chronic streptozotocin diabetes in rats facilitates the acute stress response without altering pituitary or adrenal responsiveness to secretagogues. We have used streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats to determine whether this represents a sustained stimulus to the adrenocortical system and whether STZ-diabetic rats are able to mount an acute stress response. Furthermore, we compared pituitary responsiveness to CRF and/or arginine vasopressin, and adrenal responsiveness to ACTH in STZ- vs. vehicle-treated rats. We also compared the efficacy of dexamethasone inhibitory feedback in STZ-diabetic and control rats. Our results show that STZ-treated rats chronically hypersecrete corticosterone (B) as evidenced by their decreased thymus weights, their increased urinary B excretion, and their elevated mean plasma B levels during the light hours of the day. Despite the evidence for sustained hypersecretion of B, STZ-treated rats showed greater and more prolonged ACTH and B responses to the acute stress of histamine injection. However, when tested separately, neither pituitary nor adrenal responsiveness to their secretagogues were increased in STZ-diabetic compared to control rats. Dexamethasone inhibition of stress-induced B secretion was tested using two different paradigms: pentobarbital-anesthetized rats were given iv injections of acid saline, and awake rats were given ip injections of histamine. In both experiments the STZ-treated rats were relatively resistant to glucocorticoid inhibition of stress responses. This finding, taken together with the exaggerated ACTH and B responses to stress, strongly suggests that the facilitatory effects of chronic STZ-diabetes are a consequence of changes in sensitivity of central neural components of the adrenocortical system to stimulatory and/or inhibitory inputs, in conjunction with changes in glucocorticoid feedback sensitivity. 
Hemolytic-uremic syndrome following bone marrow transplantation in adults for hematologic malignancies. One hundred and sixty eight adult patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and other hematologic malignancies who underwent autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were investigated for the subsequent development of hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). All patients were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation. When examined at 3-month intervals for the first year post-BMT, all patients had uniform measurements of hematocrit (Hct) and serum creatinine. Sixteen patients who initially exhibited Hct and creatinine values that were normal range for the BMT populations developed a sudden decrease in Hct and increase in creatinine between 3 and 11 months post-BMT and fulfilled the clinical and laboratory criteria for HUS. None of these patients had known active cytomegalovirus infection, graft-versus-host disease, or cyclosporine administration. The degree of decrease in Hct and creatinine elevation ranged from solely laboratory abnormalities to a clinically significant syndrome. Twelve of the 16 patients developed acute clinical complications of congestive heart failure, hypertension (HTN), or peripheral edema. Twelve patients required red blood cell support, whereas only four patients required platelet transfusions. Both hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia have resolved in virtually all cases. At a mean follow up of 18 months postdiagnosis, creatinine elevations have persisted along with HTN. All patients have survived without life-threatening long-term sequelae. With the increasing use of BMT as a curative modality for patients with hematologic malignancies, it becomes important to prospectively monitor patients for the development of HUS and its potential long-term impact on renal function. 
Hemorrhagic shock and bacterial translocation in a swine model. Bacterial translocation is proposed as an explanation for sepsis associated with hemorrhagic shock. This study attempted to document these events in a large animal model. Male swine were randomly assigned to control (n = 10) or experimental (n = 10) groups. Animals were anaesthetized, and the bladder, portal vein, and a mesenteric lymphatic vessel cannulated. Experimental animals were bled 40% of blood volume. Over the next six hours maintenance fluids were given, and cultures of portal blood and mesenteric lymph taken. Before the swine were killed, cultures were taken from portal and systemic blood, mesenteric lymph, and lymph nodes, and a portion of terminal ileum was resected for histologic study. Experimental animals experienced significant shock as demonstrated by changes in hemodynamic and biochemical variables. Cultures and histologic examination of the terminal ileum showed no significant difference between control and experimental animals. In an unresuscitated swine model, significant bacterial translocation was not demonstrated within six hours of hemorrhagic shock. 
Beta-Lactam-beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations are active in experimental endocarditis caused by beta-lactamase-producing oxacillin-resistant staphylococci. Optimal therapeutic strategies for serious infections caused by borderline and heterotypic oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (BORSA and ORSA) strains have not been fully characterized. Recent evidence suggests that the dominant penicillin-binding protein of ORSA strains (PBP 2a) shows good affinity for ampicillin and that these strains commonly produce beta-lactamase. Therefore, we compared the in vivo efficacy of the combination of ampicillin plus sulbactam with that of vancomycin against ORSA strains. Also, the moderate resistance of BORSA strains appears to be attributable mainly to the hyperproduction of beta-lactamase. Therefore, we also studied the in vivo efficacy of ampicillin plus sulbactam against such organisms. Experimental aortic endocarditis was induced in rabbits by the following three strains: beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strain VP-986, beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain 67-0, and its beta-lactamase-negative clone. In animals with BORSA endocarditis, ampicillin plus sulbactam and oxacillin were highly effective in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities, with each being significantly better than either ampicillin alone or no therapy. In animals with endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-producing ORSA strain, ampicillin plus sulbactam was significantly better at reducing mean vegetation bacterial densities than the other regimens. For endocarditis caused by the beta-lactamase-negative ORSA clone, ampicillin was better than vancomycin in reducing mean intravegetation bacterial densities. These data show that infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing BORSA strains respond therapeutically in a manner similar to that of infections caused by oxacillin-susceptible strains, with both oxacillin and ampicillin plus sulbactam being highly efficacious. 
Management of solitary pulmonary nodules. The solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN), a single intrapulmonary spherical lesion that is fairly well circumscribed, is a common clinical problem. About half of SPNs seen in clinical practice are malignant, usually bronchogenic carcinomas. Some nodules are primary tumors of other kinds or metastatic. Virtually all benign SPNs are tuberculous or fungal granulomas. The standard management of the SPN of unknown cause is prompt surgical removal unless benignity is established by prior chest roentgenograms showing that the nodule has been stable (i.e., showing no growth) for 2 years or by the presence of a "benign" pattern of calcification. Less universally accepted criteria for benignity include (1) transthoracic needle aspiration biopsy (TNAB) showing a specific benign process, and (2) patient's age under 30 to 35 years. Bronchoscopy has a low diagnostic yield, particularly for benign nodules. SPNs usually grow at constant rates, expressed as the "doubling time" (DT). A nodule with a DT between 20 and 400 days is usually malignant. Benign nodules usually have a DT greater than 400 days. The prospective determination of DT by serial chest roentgenograms (the "wait and watch" strategy) is widely criticized but has clinical utility in special circumstances, particularly if the likelihood of malignancy is low and/or the anticipated surgical mortality is high. The presence and pattern of calcification are best shown by high-resolution thin-section computed tomography (CT). Diffuse, laminated, central or "popcorn" patterns of calcification indicate benignity. An eccentric calcium deposit or a stippled pattern does not rule out malignancy. CT densitometry will often show "occult" calcification in nodules that show no direct visual evidence of calcium deposition. The characteristics of the edge of the nodule correlate with the likelihood of malignancy. Nodules with irregular or spiculated margins are almost always malignant. The probability that the nodule is malignant (pCA) is related to the age of the patient, the diameter of the nodule, the amount of tobacco smoke inhalation, the overall prevalence of malignancy in SPNs, the nature of the edge of the lesion, and the presence or absence of occult calcification. It is possible by Bayesian techniques to combine these factors to calculate a more precise and comprehensive prediction of pCA in any given nodule. The 5-year survival after nodule resection depends on the size of the nodule at the time of surgery; it may be as high as 80% with nodules that are 1 cm in diameter. Lymph node involvement is uncommon with small tumors, and many authorities question the need for CT staging in such cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Stroke from other etiologies masquerading as migraine-stroke. There has been a recent increase in the number of studies dealing with migraine-stroke. I describe five patients in whom migraine-stroke was the clinical diagnosis but in whom the subsequent clinical events or autopsy showed a different mechanism for the cerebral infarction. Three patients had arterial dissection (one proven at autopsy), one had marantic endocarditis that had been missed on two echocardiograms (proven at autopsy), and one had generalized atherosclerosis and diabetes. These patients demonstrate that important and different etiologies may produce what seems to be the migraine-stroke syndrome. The result may be failure to recognize specific therapeutic measures that could have vitally important benefit to the patient. 
Early loss of neurogenic inflammation in the human diabetic foot. 1. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by nociceptor C fibres, is part of the acute neurovascular response to injury producing the axon reflex flare. Laser Doppler flowmetry was used to measure the flare response induced by the electrophoresis, at various current strengths, of a ring of acetylcholine solution into dorsal foot skin. 2. Nineteen control subjects and 52 long-duration insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetic patients of similar age (20 without complications; 19 with laser-treated retinopathy; 13 with reduced vibration perception and retinopathy) were studied in order to investigate the possible attenuation of this defence mechanism in diabetes. 3. The maximal (1 mA) flare response [control median (interquartile range): 1.55 (1.16-2.06) arbitrary units] was reduced greatly in neuropathic patients [0.37 (0.24-0.66) arbitrary units; P less than or equal to 0.001 with respect to all other groups], especially those with a previous history of foot ulceration. The flare was also reduced in some patients with retinopathy alone [1.06 (0.56-1.27) arbitrary units; P less than 0.005 with respect to control subjects]. 4. No rightward shift of the curve of hyperaemic response plotted against current strength was found, suggesting that the abnormal response was due to axonal loss rather than to dysfunction. 5. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by small pain fibres, was markedly impaired in a group of diabetic patients at risk of foot ulceration. Furthermore, impairment of this nociceptor C fibre response can develop before clinical large-fibre neuropathy and could itself predispose to foot complications. 
Sex differences in the perception of noxious heat stimuli. This study compared pain perception in young male and female subjects, using experimental noxious heat stimuli. During 2 sessions, each of 40 subjects rated the magnitude of 120 heat stimuli, ranging from 45 degrees C to 50 degrees C. The study included a comparison of visual analogue and magnitude matching rating procedures, as well as a test of simulated analgesia, in which the range of stimuli presented during the 2 experimental sessions was shifted by 1 degree C. We found that females rated noxious heat stimuli as more intense than did males, independent of the gender of the experimenter or the type of rating scale. In addition, the data suggest that females discriminate among the painful heat intensities better than males. For example, female subjects showed significant between-session discrimination of noxious heat stimuli, while male subjects did not, and females produced steeper within-session stimulus-response functions than did males. These observed differences in nociceptive discrimination between males and females indicate that the sex-related variation in pain perception is probably related to sensory factors rather than differences in attitude or emotional response. 
Ridogrel in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The safety of the combination of heparin and ridogrel therapy and its antiplatelet efficacy was examined in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In 32 patients without known aspirin intake for 10 days before PTCA, therapy with ridogrel (300-mg intravenous bolus) was begun just before PTCA and continued orally at a dose of 300 mg twice daily until discharge. Heparin was administered as a 10,000 IU bolus dose before PTCA and followed by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1,000 IU/hour for 24 hours. Bleeding problems at the arterial entry site occurred in 13 patients, which required a blood transfusion in only 2 patients. One patient underwent emergency bypass surgery without specific problems of hemostasis. Ridogrel virtually eliminated thromboxane B2 from the serum (29,990 +/- 6,555 pg/0.1 ml before vs 63 +/- 7 pg/0.1 ml at 2 hours after ridogrel), with a concomitant increase in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (511 +/- 34 pg/0.1 ml before vs 1,190 +/- 146 pg/0.1 ml at 24 hours after ridogrel). There were no acute reocclusions in the ridogrel-treated patients, whereas acute reocclusions occurred in 5.6% of the patients taking the standard aspirin + heparin regimen during the same period. Furthermore, at 6-month clinical follow-up patients treated with ridogrel compared favorably with those receiving standard treatment. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of white clot syndrome. This study describes our experience with 12 patients with white clot syndrome encountered during a recent 36-month period. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria: (1) development of thrombocytopenia of less than 100,000/mm3 during administration of heparin therapy, (2) normalization of the platelet count after an interruption in heparin therapy, (3) exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia, (4) a positive heparin-induced platelet aggregation test, (5) detection of white clots on pathologic examination, and (6) the presence of thrombotic complications. Of 2,500 patients who received heparin therapy, 12 (0.48%) developed white clot syndrome. Various indications, routes of administration, and types of heparin were implicated. The mean platelet nadir was 26,900/mm3, and the mean time to onset of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was 5 days. Thrombotic complications included arterial occlusions of the legs in 11 patients, deep vein thrombosis of the legs in 9 patients (4 had pulmonary embolism), and combined arterial and venous thrombosis in 8 patients. Treatment strategies included discontinuation of heparin in all patients and intravenous infusion of dextran, followed by arterial thrombectomy in four patients, urokinase therapy in two patients for arterial complications, and insertion of Greenfield filters in six patients. All patients were given warfarin. The mortality rate was 25% and the morbidity rate was 50%. An initial platelet count should be obtained on all patients prior to receiving heparin, followed by repeat platelet counts every 2 to 3 days. Once thrombocytopenia or thrombosis is diagnosed, heparin should be discontinued and other methods of therapy considered. 
Lower urinary tract reconstruction following cystectomy: experience and results in 126 patients using the Kock ileal reservoir with bilateral ureteroileal urethrostomy. Between May 1986 and February 1990, 126 consecutive men underwent lower urinary tract reconstruction by means of bilateral ureteroileal urethrostomy using a Kock ileal reservoir. The early complication rate was 11.1%. Late complications requiring rehospitalization or reoperation have been surprisingly few: 1 for prolapse of the afferent antirefluxing nipple valve, 1 for calculi and 4 for artificial urinary sphincter placement due to unsatisfactory continence. Good continence has been achieved in 94% of the patients during the day and in 84% at night. Tumor recurred in the pelvis in 5 patients, with 4 requiring cutaneous urinary diversion. All patients had progression or died of metastatic disease. Our experience has yielded extraordinary results in terms of patient acceptance with few late complications or need for reoperation. 
Functional results after total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation. Locally advanced tongue cancer is a devastating disease for which there are limited therapeutic options that will result in a high rate of cure while preserving function. To determine the oncologic effectiveness of total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation and the possibility of speech and swallowing rehabilitation following treatment, we reviewed our experience with 27 patients treated between 1982 and 1989. Twenty-four patients were eligible for 2-year follow-up and their disease-specific survival was 51%. Swallowing was achieved initially in 18 patients (67%), while 12 had successful long-term deglutition (44%). Oral communication was accomplished in 25 patients (92%). Significant aspiration occurred in three patients and was severe enough to require interval laryngectomy in two patients. The role of laryngeal suspension, palatal augmentation prosthesis, and videofluoroscopy as rehabilitation adjuncts for the total glossectomy patient are described. 
Retrospective analysis of the incidence of pulmonary disease in hypogammaglobulinemia. To determine the best predictors of chronic pulmonary disease in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, we evaluated the clinical records, chest x-ray films, and pulmonary function tests of 10 patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) followed for a mean of 12.5 years, and 12 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) followed for a mean of 10.5 years. These patients, most of whom were treated with intramuscular gamma globulin and long-term oral antibiotics, had very few pneumonias after diagnosis. The patients with XLA had 0.10 pneumonias per treatment year, and the patients with CVID had 0.18 pneumonias per treatment year. Seven of the 10 patients with XLA had normal chest x-ray films 8 to 15 years after diagnosis, and none had bronchiectasis. Pulmonary disease was more common and more severe in the group with CVID, but five patients in this group also had normal chest x-ray films after long follow-up. In the entire group of 22 patients, nine of the 10 patients with abnormal chest x-ray films on most recent evaluation already had pulmonary disease at the initial visit (p = 0.00002). These studies indicate that the best predictors of good pulmonary function in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia are early diagnosis and good compliance with gamma globulin replacement therapy and oral antibiotics. 
Stage I seminoma of the testis. Adjuvant radiotherapy or surveillance? Lately the role of radiotherapy in stage I seminoma of the testis has been questioned by some authors who reported on a "surveillance" strategy for these patients. Since 1980, 124 patients with seminoma of the testis have been referred to this institution; 97 of 116 patients analysed presented with stage I disease and 10 of these had elevated levels of beta HCG. A total of 64 patients were given radiotherapy after orchiectomy and 33 entered a surveillance protocol. After a median follow-up of 48 months, 3 patients in the surveillance group relapsed after 5, 13 and 49 months and 2 of the irradiated patients did so after 25 and 33 months. Elevation of beta HCG was not significant because none of these patients showed progression. A low rate of progression and excellent survival are associated with standard treatment (orchiectomy and radiotherapy) and good results have been achieved with chemotherapy in cases of relapse. A surveillance policy is not recommended in stage I seminoma because of its slower growth compared with non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT), the absence of a specific tumour marker, the 10% risk of occult metastases and the 3-fold higher progression rate compared with irradiated patients. We suggest the use of a reduced dosage and radiation field. 
Remodeling of ventricular conduction pathways in healed canine infarct border zones. Remodeling of myocyte interconnections may be an important determinant of ventricular tachycardia in regions bordering healed infarcts. We used quantitative electron microscopy to characterize the distribution of gap junctions in 10 canine left ventricles 3-10 wk after coronary occlusion. In three normal canine left ventricles analyzed ultrastructurally, myocardial gap junctions were distributed anisotropically; gap junction profile length was significantly greater in the transverse than in longitudinal planes of section. In infarct border zone tissues, the normal anisotropic distribution was completely abolished and fewer gap junctions per unit intercalated disk length were observed. Analysis of individual gap junction profile length distributions revealed selective disruption of the largest gap junctions that collectively comprised only 9.6% of total junction profiles, but encompassed nearly 40% of aggregate gap junction length in the transverse plane of section. Three-dimensional reconstructions of myocyte interconnections by high resolution quantitative light microscopy of serial sections demonstrated a reduction in the number of cells connected by intercalated disks to a single myocyte from 11.2 +/- 1.0 in normal myocardium to 6.5 +/- 1.3 in border zone tissues (P less than 0.001). Connections of cells in primarily side-to-side apposition were reduced by 75%, whereas primarily end-to-end connections were reduced by only 22% (P less than 0.05). These alterations would disproportionately enhance axial resistivity in the transverse direction, potentially contributing to development of reentrant arrhythmias. 
Bilateral impairment of somesthetically mediated object recognition in humans Thirty adult patients (six in each of five groups--neurologically normal, lacunar infarct-related hemiparesis, unilateral thalamic lacunar infarction, right cortical infarction with mild left hemineglect, and extensive right cortical infarction with severe left hemineglect) were asked to perform various tasks that encompassed basic and intermediate somatosensory functions and tactile and visual object recognition. Patients with thalamic and cortical infarctions had severe impairment of contralateral hand-mediated somatosensory functions in all three categories of somesthetic tasks, although patients with cortical infarction were more impaired on the object recognition task than were patients with thalamic infarction. Patients with extensive damage to the right hemisphere and severe left hemineglect also had impairment of somesthetically mediated object recognition in the ipsilateral hand despite normal basic and intermediate somatosensory function and visually mediated object recognition analogous to unilateral tactile agnosia. All other groups had normal ipsilateral tactile object recognition.
