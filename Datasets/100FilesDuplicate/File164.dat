Childhood haemangiomas of the head and neck. Haemangiomas of the head and neck in children may be of several histological types, the clinical course depending on the group to which the haemangioma belongs. Treatment may be required if the haemangioma interferes with the airway, as in the subglottic group, or if the lesion becomes ulcerated with subsequent haemorrhage, as in capillary cavernous haemangiomas. Most haemangiomas require no immediate treatment as they involute spontaneously, though parental reassurance will be of paramount importance. Those lesions which persist may be amenable to treatment at a later date, the laser probably offering the best long-term results in terms of cosmesis as in the case of port-wine stains. Superselective embolization is becoming the treatment of choice for arterial haemangiomas. This paper is designed to clarify the histological and clinical features of these tumours and their management in view of considerable confusion in the literature encountered in our study. 
Patterns of morbidity and mortality in typhoid fever dependent on age and gender: review of 552 hospitalized patients with diarrhea. Features of typhoid fever were correlated with age and gender through a review of the charts of 552 hospitalized culture-positive patients with diarrhea in Bangladesh. Seizures occurred more frequently in children from birth through 10 years of age (5%-11%) and pneumonia more frequently in children from birth through 5 years of age (8%-15%) than in older age groups (P less than .05), whereas intestinal perforation occurred more frequently in patients greater than or equal to 11 years of age (5%-25%) than in younger age groups (P less than .005). Compared with older age groups, children from birth through 10 years of age were more anemic, those from birth through 5 years of age had a higher mean white blood cell count, and those from birth through 1 year of age had a lower mean blood carbon dioxide content (all P less than .05). Female patients were more severely anemic than male patients (P less than .05). The case-fatality rate was 4.3% overall, with the highest rates for children from birth through 1 year of age (11%) and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age (10%). Female patients had a higher case-fatality rate (6%) than male patients (3%), although the difference was not significant (P greater than .05). Death was independently associated with seizures, intestinal perforation, pneumonia, and delirium or coma. These results indicated that the patients with typhoid fever who were at highest risk of complications and death were children from birth through 1 year of age and adults greater than or equal to 31 years of age. 
An improved method for computerized tomography-planned transperineal 125iodine prostate implants. Transperineal 125iodine implants of the prostate can be performed with ultrasound guidance, a simple technique that has met with widespread acceptance. However, ultrasound does not allow good visualization of the pubic bones in relation to the pelvic outlet, and the pubic bones may interfere with needle placement in the anterior peripheral aspect of the prostate. Adequate irradiation of the entire periphery of the prostate is important to assure tumor control, since most tumors are multicentric and may involve the anterior aspect of the prostate. A computerized tomography-based treatment planning procedure that allows for angulation of transperineal needles to avoid the pubic bones and still reaches the most peripheral aspects of the gland is described. The technique also allows for the use of transrectal ultrasound and fluoroscopy to verify correct needle placement in the prostate at the procedure. Early treatment results, based on prostate specific antigen and regression of palpable tumors, are encouraging. 
Spatial and temporal registration of cardiac SPECT and MR images: methods and evaluation. Image registration may assist in the integration of information from multiple sources by allowing direct point-for-point comparisons of studies. To determine the usefulness of such a technique, a method for the spatial and temporal registration of four-dimensional single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) and magnetic resonance (MR) cardiac images was developed. Automatically detected left ventricular endocardial surfaces were used to determine the best transform between the two sets of surface points, and that transform was applied to the original SPECT image. A fused image created from the MR and the transformed SPECT images combined the information in both. The authors tested the method with seven patient studies. Registration reduced the distance between the MR and SPECT left ventricular endocardial surfaces by 30%, to an average of 2.7 mm. The authors found that, by using the fused images, perfusion abnormalities could be easily localized and correlated to high-resolution endocardial wall motion and systolic wall thickening. 
Intractable partial epilepsy: evaluation and treatment. Partial (focal or localization--related) epilepsy is the most common seizure disorder encountered in patients with epilepsy. These seizures are focal at onset-that is, emanating from a localized region of the brain. Patients with partial epilepsy may have seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drug medication. The financial burden for these patients includes the cost of medical care and often the loss of employment. Psychosocial deterioration may be progressive as long as the seizures are intractable. Management includes confirmation of the type (or types) of seizures, exclusion of an intracranial epileptogenic lesion, and use of appropriate antiepileptic drug therapy. Referral of affected patients to a comprehensive epilepsy center for possible surgical treatment and investigational drug studies should be considered. In the care of the patient with intractable partial epilepsy, the goals should be to render the patient free of seizures and to allow the patient to become a participating and productive member of society. 
The role of echocardiography/Doppler in catheter balloon treatment of adults with aortic and mitral stenosis. Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) have played a major role in the evaluation of patients undergoing catheter balloon treatment of aortic and mitral stenosis. Doppler/2DE has made possible an understanding of the mechanism of increase in valve area. Before the procedure, Doppler/2DE provides a reasonable estimate of the severity of the valvular stenosis and associated cardiac abnormalities. The evaluation of mitral valve morphology by 2DE before catheter balloon treatment has shown that patients with excellent leaflet motion and minimal increase in valve thickness have the greatest increase in mitral valve area. During the procedure, Doppler/2DE can aid in the transseptal puncture, in positioning the balloons across the stenotic orifice, and in the immediate assessment of changes in valve function and complications. The estimate of the aortic and mitral valve gradients and areas by Doppler/2DE before catheter balloon treatment shows a reasonable correlation with hemodynamic measurements. Immediately after the procedure, the Doppler/2DE estimates of aortic valve gradient and area show a fair correlation with data from cardiac catheterization, provided care is taken to avoid technical problems. Doppler/2DE assessment of mitral valve area immediately after catheter balloon commissurotomy (CBC) shows a poor correlation with catheterization data, which has been attributed to rapid changes in left atrial compliance and gradient. However, the correlation of Doppler estimates of mitral valve area with catheterization data improves at 3 months after CBC. Serial evaluations of patients after aortic or mitral catheter balloon dilatation should permit detection of restenosis and valve regurgitation and assessment of ventricular function and may provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of restenosis and changing clinical status. 
Liver tumor promotion: effect of phenobarbital on EGF and protein kinase C signal transduction and transforming growth factor-beta 1 expression. Phenobarbital (PB) added to the medium of cultured rat hepatocytes alters epidermal growth factor (EGF) dependent mitogenesis in a biphasic manner; PB concentrations less than 1.5 mM are growth stimulatory but higher concentrations significantly inhibit normal hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast, the growth of putative preneoplastic cells is inhibited less by high concentrations of PB. Mechanistic studies designed to test the ability of PB to alter the early events of EGF signal transduction demonstrate that PB neither competes with EGF for binding to the EGF receptor nor alters EGF-induced receptor down-regulation. However, pretreatment with PB (greater than 1 mM) results in a transient inhibition of EGF binding to hepatocytes. The kinetics of this effect are similar to those obtained when hepatocytes are exposed to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a skin tumor promoter and activator of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. However, several observations suggest that distinct mechanisms mediate the responses to these two tumor promoters. First, the inhibitory effects of PB and TPA on EGF binding are additive. Also down-regulation of EGF receptors in response to TPA occurs with hepatocytes, A431 epidermal carcinoma cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and rat liver epithelial cells, but only hepatocytes are sensitive to PB. Furthermore, translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane occurs in hepatocytes treated with TPA but not in those treated with PB. The chronic treatment of rats with PB further sensitizes hepatocytes to EGF receptor down-regulation by in vitro PB while desensitizing them to EGF receptor down-regulation by TPA. This latter effect is correlated with a decreased ability of TPA to induce translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane. PB significantly increases the intracellular concentration of TGF-beta 1 in periportal hepatocytes but not in putative preneoplastic cells. TGF-beta 1 may therefore have an important function in regulating early stages of cell cycle progression in proliferating hepatocytes. 
Analysis of reconstruction for anterior mandibular defects using AO plates. The functional and cosmetic outcome of 11 patients who had anterior arch mandibulectomy for stage II-IV oral cavity carcinoma and were reconstructed with AO stainless-steel or titanium plates was retrospectively analyzed. Although the complication rate was high, plate removal was uncommon. Patients were afforded good function and cosmesis. Severity of postoperative infection corresponded to a low preoperative absolute lymphocyte count, which suggests that increased preoperative diet supplementation may decrease the incidence of early infections. Improved mandibular function and esthetics may allow future patients to be offered early reconstruction routinely. 
Persistent extrapyramidal syndrome with dystonia and rigidity caused by combined metoclopramide and prochlorperazine therapy. We have reported the case of a 58-year-old woman with cerebral palsy who experienced a persistent, generalized syndrome of dystonia and rigidity (tardive dystonia-parkinsonism) while being treated for vomiting with metoclopramide in combination with prochlorperazine. This syndrome was more severe than is typically seen in drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes and may have contributed to her death. The extreme severity of this disorder was probably related to the use of a combination of dopamine antagonists in a patient who had premorbid cerebral dysfunction. Although dopamine antagonists should always be used with caution in individuals with cerebral dysfunction, this particular combination of antiemetics should probably be avoided in such patients. 
Cardiac anaesthesia in a patient with myotonic dystrophy. We describe a patient with myotonic dystrophy who required open-heart surgery for an atrial septal defect. He also had a sick sinus syndrome and an abnormal myocardium on histological examination. Anaesthesia using fentanyl, droperidol, nitrous oxide and a low concentration of enflurane was uneventful. Atelectasis of the left lung developed on the first postoperative day after removal of the tracheal tube. This was successfully treated by fibreoptic bronchoscopy. 
Respiratory compliance during sedation, anesthesia, and paralysis in infants and young children. Although total respiratory compliance (Crs) has been shown to fall in adults on induction of halothane anesthesia, no successful paired studies have been reported in children. The multiple occlusion technique was used to measure Crs in 17 infants and young children during sedated sleep (CrsS) and shortly after, following induction of halothane anesthesia (CrsA). Crs fell in all but one infant after induction of anesthesia, with a mean fall of 34.7% (range 0-58%). This was accompanied by a reduction in tidal volume and increase in frequency in every case. In 7 of the 17 children, who were to be paralyzed for surgical purposes, Crs was also measured in this anesthetized-paralyzed state. When tidal volume administered during manual ventilation was similar to that observed during measurement of CrsA, Crs during this low-volume ventilation was similar to CrsA. When tidal volume was increased and Crs remeasured, there was a significant increase in every case, with the high-volume Crs within 10% of CrsS in all but one child, in whom there was a 31.4% increase with respect to CrsS. Changes in tidal volume accounted for approximately 50% of the variability in each state. These results demonstrate a highly significant fall in Crs in infants and young children after induction of halothane anesthesia. In addition it appears that this reduction in Crs can be reversed by paralyzing the child and manually ventilating with tidal volumes approximating those seen during sedation. 
Thrombolytic and pharmacokinetic properties of chimeric tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators. BACKGROUND. Chimeric molecules comprising the A-chain of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and the catalytic domain of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) have intact enzymatic characteristics of u-PA, partial fibrin-binding properties of t-PA, and thrombolytic properties in animal models comparable with but not superior to those of single-chain u-PA (scu-PA). Deletion of the finger and growth factor domains (t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e) in such chimeras further reduces their affinity for fibrin. METHODS AND RESULTS. A detailed investigation of the thrombolytic potency and the pharmacokinetics of t-PA and u-PA chimeras was performed in quantitative animal models for thrombolysis. In hamsters with pulmonary embolism, in rabbits with jugular vein thrombosis, and in baboons with femoral vein thrombosis, the thrombolytic potency (percent lysis per milligram of compound administered per kilogram of body weight) of t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e was significantly higher than that of recombinant scu-PA (rscu-PA, Saruplase) as shown by a maximal rate of 720 +/- 170% versus 45 +/- 5% lysis per milligram of compound per kilogram of body weight (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) in hamsters, 210 +/- 18% versus 49 +/- 3% lysis per milligram of compound per kilogram of body weight (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01) in rabbits, and 310 +/- 73% versus 90 +/- 0.3% lysis per milligram of compound per kilogram of body weight (p less than 0.01) in baboons. However, the specific thrombolytic activity (percent lysis per microgram per milliliter steady-state plasma antigen level) of t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e was not significantly different from that of rscu-PA in hamsters (210 +/- 57% versus 160 +/- 27% lysis per microgram per milliliter antigen level) and was lower than that of rscu-PA in rabbits (37 +/- 4% versus 130 +/- 5% lysis per microgram per milliliter antigen level; p less than 0.01). In dogs with a combined femoral vein blood clot and a platelet-rich femoral arterial eversion graft thrombosis, 0.25 mg/kg body wt bolus injections of t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e produced significantly more venous clot lysis (90 +/- 5%, n = 10) than 0.25 mg/kg rscu-PA (26 +/- 3%, n = 10) (p less than 0.001) and, at the arterial side, more frequent (10 of 10 dogs versus three of 10 dogs) and more persistent (six of 10 dogs versus none of 10 dogs) recanalization (p = 0.002). After bolus injection in hamsters, rabbits, or baboons, t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e had a fourfold to sixfold longer initial half-life than rscu-PA and a slower plasma clearance of sixfold in hamsters, 10-fold in rabbits, and more than 10-fold in baboons. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that t-PA-delta FE/scu-PA-e has a markedly enhanced thrombolytic potency toward venous and arterial thrombi caused by a delayed in vivo clearance with relatively maintained specific thrombolytic activity. These properties suggest that the chimera may be clinically useful for thrombolytic therapy by bolus administration in patients with thromboembolic disease. 
The effect of steroid therapy on recovery from tonsillectomy in children. A prospective, randomized, double-blind study to determine the postoperative effects of steroids in tonsillectomy was performed on 25 children from 4 to 12 years of age. A single intravenous dose of dexamethasone or a placebo was administered at onset of surgery. Other preoperative and postoperative medications, including antibiotics, anesthesia, and surgical techniques were standardized as noted in this article. The ability to return to a full or semifull diet occurred on the third and fourth postoperative days, significantly sooner in the steroid-treated patients than in the control patients. By the fifth and sixth days, the control group were eating as well as those children who received steroids. No significant differences were observed in postoperative pain, nausea, emesis, fever, or in the need for postoperative pain medications. This preliminary article concludes that a single preoperative dose of steroid results in an earlier return to a normal (full) diet in children who had undergone tonsillectomy. 
Heterogeneity of epithelial marker expression in routinely processed, poorly differentiated carcinomas. The application of immunohistochemical markers against epithelial antigens has proved useful for studying tumor differentiation and in aiding tumor diagnosis. However, the reactivity of various epithelial markers with poorly differentiated carcinomas (the situation in which they are most often used) has not been well established. As a result, it is unclear how negative results should be interpreted and how often more than one antibody may be needed to document the epithelial nature of poorly differentiated neoplasms. We studied 98 poorly differentiated epithelial tumors with AE1, CAM 5.2, and EMA to assess the use of these markers in their diagnosis. Both CAM 5.2 and EMA provided support for epithelial differentiation in 71% (70/98) of the cases, while AE1 stained 50% (49/98) of the tumors; CAM 5.2 was the single most useful marker in the subset of poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, staining 20 (77%) of 26 tumors. Use of these markers in pairs increased the recognition of epithelial differentiation (at least one marker showing positive staining) as follows: AE1/CAM 5.2, 80% (78/98); AE1/EMA, 87% (85/98); and CAM 5.2/EMA, 99% (97/98). Thirty carcinomas stained with all three markers, 34 with two markers, and in 34 cases only one antibody supported epithelial differentiation. Twelve (21%) of 58 tumors showed evidence of S100 reactivity. None of the 71 cases to which PD7 was applied showed staining This study indicates that poorly differentiated carcinomas are heterogeneous in their expression of antigens recognized by AE1, CAM 5.2, and EMA. Moreover, these results quantitate the probability of reactivity with poorly differentiated carcinomas for each marker and support the use of one or more antibodies in a "backup" panel when a negative result is obtained with a single antibody and the diagnosis of carcinoma is still suspected. 
Hyperbaric treatment of cerebral air embolism sustained during an open-heart surgical procedure A case of cerebral air embolism sustained during replacement of the mitral valve resulted in postoperative coma and seizures. Hyperbaric treatment, begun 30 hours after the occurrence of the air embolism, resulted in good immediate and long-term recovery. Mild deficits of the left hemisphere were present at follow-up 53 days after the embolus was sustained, and lesser, minimal residua were present at 14-month follow-up. Hyperbaric treatment is the definitive therapy for cerebral air embolism. Although it is most effective when administered early, the outcome may be excellent even with late treatment. 
Echocardiographic detection of coronary artery disease during dobutamine infusion. BACKGROUND. Two-dimensional echocardiography performed during dobutamine infusion has been proposed as a potentially useful method for detecting coronary artery disease. However, the safety and diagnostic value of dobutamine stress echocardiography has not been established. METHODS AND RESULTS. In this study, echocardiograms were recorded during step-wise infusion of dobutamine to a maximum dose of 30 micrograms/kg/min in 103 patients who also underwent quantitative coronary angiography. The echocardiograms were digitally stored and displayed in a format that allowed simultaneous analysis of rest and stress images. Development of a new abnormality in regional function was used as an early end point for the dobutamine infusion. No patient had a symptomatic arrhythmia or complications from stress-induced ischemia. Significant coronary artery disease (greater than or equal to 50% diameter stenosis) was present in 35 of 55 patients who had normal echocardiograms at rest. The sensitivity and specificity of dobutamine-induced wall motion abnormalities for coronary artery disease was 89% (31 of 35) and 85% (17 of 20), respectively. The sensitivity was 81% (17 of 21) in those with one-vessel disease and 100% (14 of 14) in those with multivessel or left main disease. Forty-one of 48 patients with abnormal echocardiograms at baseline had localized rest wall motion abnormalities. Fifteen had coronary artery disease confined to regions that had abnormal rest wall motion, and 26 had disease remote from these regions. Thirteen of 15 patients (87%) without remote disease did not develop remote stress-induced abnormalities, and 21 of 26 (81%) who had remote disease developed corresponding abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS. Echocardiography combined with dobutamine infusion is a safe and accurate method for detecting coronary artery disease and for predicting the extent of disease in those who have localized rest wall motion abnormalities. 
Systemic lupus erythematosus presenting as an intracranial bleed. A previously healthy 12-year-old girl presented with fever and mental status changes without focal neurologic deficit. A CBC and computed tomography scan revealed thrombocytopenia and an intracranial bleed. Further laboratory studies were consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus. This case emphasizes the need to maintain a high index of suspicion for atypical presentations of an uncommon childhood illness. 
Late cardiac tamponade after open-heart surgery. Late cardiac tamponade occurred in 74 patients 5-287 (median 16) days after open-heart surgery and was treated with pericardiocentesis or surgery. The overall incidence of late cardiac tamponade was 1.3%. After valve operations it was 2.6% and after isolated coronary surgery 0.7% (53/2,028 vs. 18/2,661, p less than 0.002). The diagnosis was assessed by echocardiography in 93% of cases. Pericardiocentesis, attempted in 65 cases (88%), was curative in 80% but failed in 20%. Eight of the latter 13 underwent emergency surgery and five were medically treated. Failure of pericardiocentesis was associated with posterior location of fluid, clots, echo-free space less than 20 mm or myocardial insufficiency. The subxiphoid part of the wound was surgically re-entered in ten cases and the entire sternotomy in seven. Four patients (5%) died within 30 days of the primary intervention. All hospital survivors were observed for a median of 44 (range 11-115) months. Three (4%) had recurrent pericardial effusion requiring repeat pericardiocentesis, but none had pericardial constriction. The 5-year survival rate was 73%. 
A community-based study of incidence, risk factors and outcome of transient ischaemic attacks in Umbria, Italy: the SEPIVAC study. The SEPIVAC study is a community-based epidemiological survey of incidence and outcome of transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and strokes in the territory of the 6th Local Health Unit, Umbria, Italy, where 49,218 people live, from 1 September 1986 to 31 August 1989. All cases were registered with the study either by notification from general practitioners (GPs) or by a check of hospital admission within the study area and in the two hospitals of Perugia. There were 94 incident cases of TIAs (45 males, 49 females), thus giving a crude rate of 0.64 per 1000 per year [95% conficence intervals (CI) 0.52/0.78]. The rate adjusted to the European population is 0.42 (CI 0.33/0.54). Mean age was 69.4 years, and females were significantly older than males. The weighted relative risk for males was 1.19 (CI 0.79/1.79). Thirty-one patients were treated at home by their GPs. Females had hypertension more frequently than males, whereas males smoked more frequently; we did not find any other statistically significant difference in the distribution of risk factors. Twelve patients out of 58 who had CT had an infarct, and 29 out of 54 submitted to Doppler ultrasonography had carotid stenosis. At 1 month, 4 patients had suffered an ischaemic stroke, 1 of whom died. At 6 months, 3 further strokes and 2 further deaths (1 due to myocardial infarction) had occurred. 
A dose-response study of nalbuphine for post-thoracotomy epidural analgesia. The analgesic efficacy and side-effects of epidural nalbuphine (0.075-0.3 mg.kg-1) were compared with epidural morphine 0.1 mg.kg-1 in a randomised double-blind study in post-thoracotomy patients. The drugs were administered via a lumbar epidural catheter one hour before the end of surgery. Efficacy was assessed using visual analogue pain scores and supplementary iv fentanyl requirements; respiratory function was studied with an inductive plethysmograph and arterial blood gas analysis; and plasma nalbuphine levels were measured. Pain scores and fentanyl supplementation were lowest in the morphine group (P less than 0.01). No dose-response effect was apparent in the nalbuphine dose-range studied. Respiratory depression was more common in patients receiving morphine (higher mean PaCO2P less than 0.01, more frequent apnoeas greater than 15 sec P less than 0.05, and incidence of PaCO2 greater than 50 mmHg requiring naloxone P less than 0.01). There were no differences in haemodynamic variables, sedation, or other side-effects among the groups. The pharmacokinetic profile of epidural nalbuphine was similar to that seen with rapid iv injection. The results indicate that, relative to morphine, lumbar epidural nalbuphine is an ineffective analgesic after thoracotomy. Despite the lower incidence of respiratory depression its administration by this route cannot be recommended. 
The human hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen (CD34) in vascular neoplasia. The human hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34 is synthesized and expressed by early normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and by many acute leukemias. Anti-CD34 antibodies also have been reported to stain blood vessels in tissue sections, and, more recently, CD34 mRNA has been detected in vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, the authors studied the diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical CD34 antigen detection in tumors of endothelial cell derivation and compared the results with stains for von Willebrand (vW) factor. A wide variety of epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms also were examined to assess the specificity of CD34 for vascular neoplasia. Seven cases of angiosarcoma (seven of seven), five cases of Kaposi's sarcoma (five of five), and eight cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (eight of eight) were moderately to strongly positive for CD34. This reactivity was equally intense in frozen sections, alcohol-fixed tissue, and formalin-fixed specimens. In many cases, the malignant endothelial cells stained more strongly than adjacent benign endothelium. Moreover, in most cases CD34 positivity was quantitatively and qualitatively stronger than staining for vW factor. Two cases of hemangiopericytoma (two of two) were CD34 positive but stained less intensely than the angiosarcomas, Kaposi's sarcomas, or hemangioendotheliomas. Five of six cases of hemangioma also stained positively for CD34; the nonreactive tumor in this group was the only one among 28 vascular neoplasms studied that was not reactive for CD34. In comparison, 9 of the 28 vascular tumors did not stain for vW factor. Three hundred fifty-seven tumors of nonvascular derivation also were examined for CD34 antigen expression. Focal light staining was seen in one pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma; moderate to intense staining was observed in half of the epithelioid sarcomas studied (8 of 16) and in a minority of leiomyosarcomas (3 of 22). These findings indicate that CD34 is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for neoplasms of vascular origin. 
Prevalence of HIV, hepatitis B and associated risk behaviours in clients of a needle-exchange in central London. In order to determine the prevalence of risk behaviour for, and antibodies to HIV and hepatitis B in clients of a needle-exchange scheme in central London we employed an anonymous, self-administered questionnaire along with salivary antibody testing by immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody capture immunoassay. Two hundred and thirty-two subjects (193 men, 39 women; median age 32) participated; a response rate of 89%. Clients were long-term, frequent injectors. Lending used equipment at any time was reported by 55%, and borrowing by 52%. Of those who had shared needles and syringes during the last year, the majority had lent to, or borrowed from, one person only (53 and 55%, respectively). Younger clients (less than 29 years of age) reported more recent sharing than older clients (greater than 30 years of age). Five out of 211 (2.4%) samples tested for anti-HIV were positive. One hundred and eleven out of 199 (56%) samples were positive for anti-hepatitis B core (HBc). In this population of needle-exchange attenders there is no evidence of further spread of HIV, and a low prevalence of HIV infection appears to have been sustained. However, the high prevalence of anti-HBc provides evidence of previous risk behaviour and so constant vigilance is necessary if further viral spread is to be avoided. This study has established an acceptable method for the anonymous surveillance of current risk behaviour and salivary antibodies to HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in a drug-using population. 
Conventional screen/film vs reduced exposure photostimulable phosphor plate imaging in lower extremity venography: an ROC analysis. Half-exposure phosphor plates used in venography substantially reduce the total X-ray exposure to a patient while increasing the chance that all images will be of excellent diagnostic quality. Simultaneous half-exposure phosphor plate and full-exposure conventional screen/film venograms were obtained of 35 patients and compared by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The area under the ROC curve ranged from 0.67 to 0.78 for conventional films and 0.68 to 0.91 for phosphor plates. Group performances on conventional films vs phosphor plates were not statistically different. No statistically significant difference in individual performance with the two techniques was seen in seven of the eight interpreters at the 95% confidence level. The eighth interpreter performed significantly better with phosphor plates than with conventional films. Interpreters with and without specific experience in phosphor plate venography were grouped separately, and performance of the two groups was compared in each technique. No difference in performance was found between the groups when interpreting conventional venograms, but, when interpreting phosphor plate venograms, the group with specific experience performed significantly better than they had with conventional venograms, and significantly better than the other group did at interpreting either conventional or phosphor plate venograms. We conclude that phosphor plate venograms made at a 50% reduction in X-ray exposure are equal to, and may surpass, conventional screen/film venograms for diagnosing acute venous thrombosis of the calf and thigh. We recommend expanding the indications for phosphor plate radiography to include contrast venography of the lower extremities. 
Sulphadiazine desensitization in patients with AIDS and cerebral toxoplasmosis. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of a sulphadiazine desensitization protocol to treat patients with AIDS and cerebral toxoplasmosis (CT) and known sulphonamide allergy, to ensure that an adequate dose of sulphadiazine (2-4 g/day) was achieved rapidly (within 4-5 days), and to assess the effect of concurrent corticosteroid (CS) administration on the success rate of the regimen. Sixteen patients with CT and a past history or current manifestations of sulphonamide allergy were desensitized to sulphadiazine from October 1988 to December 1989. The protocol employed the oral administration of gradually increasing increments of sulphadiazine 3-hourly over 5 days. Success was defined as tolerance of 2-4 g oral sulphadiazine per day for at least 7 days until death or the present time without any allergic reactions. Our success rated overall was 10 out of 16 patients (62%). Seven patients achieved a final dose of 4 g/day and three a dose of 2 g/day. Concurrent CS administration did not appear to affect the outcome in the small number of patients studied. Our sulphadiazine regimen rapidly, successfully and safely desensitized patients with CT and sulphonamide allergy, allowing the optimal first-line treatment to continue. The aetiology of allergy in HIV-infected patients and the mechanisms by which desensitization works are unknown. 
Transureteroureterostomy and terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy in advanced pelvic malignancies. Transureteroureterostomy was combined with terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy, without complications, in 8 patients with advanced pelvic malignancy and a poor prognosis. Urinary diversion was palliative in all patients and followed pelvic exenteration in 4, debulking of pelvic tumor in 2 and radical cystectomy in 1, while 1 had inoperable bladder cancer. All patients had at least unilateral hydroureteronephrosis preoperatively. In each case a postoperative excretory urogram revealed significant improvement of the hydroureteronephrosis and the serum creatinine improved or stabilized. No patient had ureteral stomal stenosis or retraction. Mean survival was 5 months, with the longest survival being 1 year. Transureteroureterostomy in conjunction with terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy is an effective technique of urinary diversion in selected patients with a poor prognosis and advanced pelvic malignancy, decreasing operative time while avoiding the morbidity associated with a ureterointestinal operation or nephrostomy. 
Effect of a new synthetic ascorbic acid derivative as a free radical scavenger on the development of acute pancreatitis in mice. The therapeutic effects of CV 3611, a new synthetic free radical scavenger prepared from an ascorbic acid derivative, on choline deficient, ethionine enriched (CDE) diet induced acute pancreatitis in mice were evaluated and compared with those of superoxide dismutase. Time/course studies after subcutaneous injection of CV 3611 in normal mice showed a peak plasma concentration of mean (SEM) 0.54 (0.09) micrograms/ml at one hour, with a gradual decrease over the next 10 hours, while a peak concentration in pancreatic tissue of mean (SEM) 425 (33) ng/g tissue was achieved at three hours and the drug was undetectable at 12 hours. Survival rates and activities of pancreatic enzymes (amylase, lipase, elastase I) were compared in control mice and animals that received CV 3611 before or at the time of feeding the CDE diet. The survival rate was observed in a no treatment group and mice given pretreatment or treatment with CV 3611 or superoxide dismutase. The survival rate was significantly better in the treatment group given CV 3611 (p less than 0.02), but superoxide dismutase had no significant effect on survival. The increases in the three serum enzyme activities were significantly less at 48 hours in the groups given pretreatment or treatment with CV 3611 than in the no treatment group. These results indicate that CV 3611, which has been proved to pass through the cell membrane and to have a long half life in plasma and tissue, had an important therapeutic effect on the development of acute pancreatitis. They also suggest that oxygen derived free radicals may play an important role in the development of acute pancreatitis. 
Postheparin plasma diamine oxidase values in the follow up of patients with small bowel Crohn's disease. Measurement of postheparin plasma diamine oxidase (PHD) activity has been proposed to assess mucosal integrity in several diseases of the small intestine. In Crohn's disease, PHD values identify a group of patients with predominantly small bowel mucosal damage. To determine the role of mucosal involvement in the progression of small bowel Crohn's disease and whether different PHD values can predict different outcomes the changes in PHD values in 41 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease admitted consecutively to our department were investigated. The test was performed during periods of active disease and after either medical or surgical treatment had resulted in improvement. PHD values were significantly lower than in normal subjects (normal range 3.7-7.7 U/ml). In 35 patients with active disease (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) greater than 150) two groups were identified by choosing a cut off value of 2 U/ml: 93% of the 15 patients with PHD values lower than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 1.36 (0.46) U/ml) relapsed at least once in the following year, while only the 20% of the 20 whose values were higher than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 3.69 (1.50)) relapsed in the same period. The data were statistically significant (Yates's corrected chi 2 = 15.63; p less than 0.0001). The positive and negative predictive values of the test were 93% and 80%, respectively. During relapses, PHD values were consistently lower than previous values, and increased significantly after effective medical or surgical treatment. In the six patients in whom there were no changes in disease activity (CDAI persistently less than 150), there was no change in PHD values. 
Factors influencing outcome of prednisone dose reduction in myasthenia gravis. We reviewed retrospectively 114 prednisone dose reduction attempts in 63 myasthenic patients. Dose reduction was considered successful if a patient remained asymptomatic for more than 1 year on no prednisone or a stable low dose of prednisone. Successful dose reduction attempts were more common in patients taking azathioprine, but thymectomy did not influence taper outcome. Slower rate of dose reduction and higher ending dose of prednisone improved the chance of success. 
Revision osteoarticular allograft transplantation in weight-bearing joints. A clinical review. The early results of revision osteoarticular allografts in weight-bearing joints are reported. Sixteen consecutive patients underwent surgery over a six-year period between 1982 and 1988. At the time of review eight patients (50%) had surviving second allografts with an average follow-up time of 48 months (range 12 to 87). Five patients were graded excellent according to the Mankin scale, one good and two fair. Eight patients (50%) required further surgery, but only two patients came to amputation. 
Controlled clinical trials of drug treatment for hypertension. A review. We reviewed the designs and major results of 17 large-scale, controlled, clinical trials that reported the effects of drug treatment for hypertension on morbidity or mortality. Seven trials conducted in study populations with more-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures 100-120 mm Hg or higher), including the more-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, showed large reductions in stroke, other "hypertensive" events, and, in one trial, total mortality. Of 11 trials in populations with less-severe hypertension (diastolic blood pressures predominantly below 105 mm Hg), including the less-severe stratum of the Veterans Administration Trial, nine met the criteria for pooling of results. Among the aggregate 43,000 patients in the nine trials who were followed up for an average of 5.6 years, mean diastolic blood pressure reduction was 5.8 mm Hg, and a significant 11% reduction in total mortality was observed. This benefit was largely attributable to a 38% reduction in fatal strokes; nonfatal strokes were similarly reduced. Coronary heart disease mortality was 8% lower in drug treatment than in control groups, but this difference was not significant. A similar result was observed for combined coronary mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction. A possible explanation for the inconclusive result regarding coronary end points was an adverse trend, observed in several trials, in a subgroup with baseline resting electrocardiographic abnormalities. Because all the trials except the propranolol arm of the Medical Research Council trial used drug regimens based on thiazide-like diuretic agents, and because there are now several new drug classes proposed as initial therapy, additional large-scale clinical trials may need to be considered. 
Resting energy expenditure in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was determined in 30 patients with newly detected non-small cell lung cancer. Measured values were compared with the values predicted by the Harris-Benedict (HB) formula. Mean REE was 20% higher than predicted. Sixty percent of the patients (18 patients) had an elevated REE (greater than or equal to 115%) compared with this formula. The prevalence of hypermetabolism in a group of patients with gastric and colorectal cancer was only 13% (13 of 104 patients). When corrected for fat-free mass (FFM), REE was still significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in the lung cancer group compared with the gastric and colorectal cancer group. Whereas weight loss in healthy men leads to an adaptational decrease in energy expenditure (EE), weight loss in the patients with lung cancer was accompanied by an increase in REE. Tumor stage, tumor localization, pulmonary function, or smoking behavior could not explain the observed increase in REE in patients with lung cancer. Therefore, these metabolic alterations appear to be tumor mediated. 
Gastric leiomyosarcoma. Prognostic factors and surgical management. Information on gastric leiomyosarcoma, such as important prognostic factors, patterns of disease recurrence, and optimal methods of treatment, are derived from limited patient experience. We address these questions, with specific focus on whether an advantage could be demonstrated for radical resection compared with wide local excision, by retrospectively investigating 53 patients who underwent surgical treatment at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. Abdominal pain and/or gastrointestinal bleeding associated with an intramural or exogastric mass were typical features of this disease. Only tumor size and histologic grade were statistically significant prognostic factors. With analysis of survival curves and patterns of recurrence, neither the addition of lymphadenectomy nor the wider tumor-free margins of a radical gastrectomy seemed superior to the more conservative local excision. Therefore, wide local excision remains the preferred treatment when technically feasible. 
Alveolitis correlates with clinical pulmonary involvement in primary Sjogren's syndrome. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 23 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (1Ss) and ten healthy controls to evaluate alveolitis and correlate it with pulmonary and systemic manifestations. Patients with 1Ss had higher BAL total cell count (9.2 +/- 6.7 millions/ml vs 6.1 +/- 2.9 millions/ml) and higher percentage of lymphocytes 23.3 +/- 15.6 percent vs 6.5 +/- 2.9 percent, p less than 0.001) than controls. Twelve patients (group A) constituted the "high alveolitis" group (lymphocytes greater than 15.2 percent) and ten (group B) constituted the "low alveolitis" group (lymphocytes less than 15.2 percent). Group A had more frequent cough (6/12 vs 2/10, p = 0.07), dyspnea (4/12 vs 1/10), and roentgenologic evidence of interstitial lung disease (5/12 vs 0/10, p less than 0.05). They also had lower total lung capacity (85.6 +/- 14.2 percent pred vs 105.8 +/- 23.3 percent pred, p less than 0.05) and Dco (87.7 +/- 20.6 percent pred vs 103.6 +/- 21.0 percent pred). All patients with +3 or +4 grading or lymphocytic infiltrates in lip biopsy specimen belonged in group A (5/12). Finally, T-helper/T-suppressor ratio was lower in group A than in group B. The intensity of alveolitis was not correlated with clinical or serologic manifestations of systemic disease. 
Comparison of exercise radionuclide angiography with thallium SPECT imaging for detection of significant narrowing of the left circumflex coronary artery. Although quantitation of exercise thallium tomograms has enhanced the noninvasive diagnosis and localization of coronary artery disease, the detection of stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery remains suboptimal. Because posterolateral regional wall motion during exercise is well assessed by radionuclide angiography, this study determined whether regional dysfunction of the posterolateral wall during exercise radionuclide angiography is more sensitive in identifying left circumflex disease than thallium perfusion abnormalities assessed by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). One hundred ten consecutive patients with CAD were studied, of whom 70 had a significant stenosis of the left circumflex coronary artery or a major obtuse marginal branch. Both regional function and segmental thallium activity of the posterolateral wall were assessed using visual and quantitative analysis. Left ventricular regional function was assessed objectively by dividing the left ventricular region of interest into 20 sectors; the 8 sectors corresponding to the posterolateral free wall were used to assess function in the left circumflex artery distribution. Similarly, using circumferential profile analysis of short-axis thallium tomograms, left ventricular myocardial activity was subdivided into 64 sectors; the 16 sectors corresponding to the posterolateral region were used to assess thallium perfusion abnormalities in the left circumflex artery territory. Qualitative posterolateral wall motion analysis detected 76% of patients with left circumflex coronary artery stenosis, with a specificity of 83%, compared with only 44% by qualitative thallium tomography (p less than 0.001) and a specificity of 92%. Whereas quantitation of thallium activity increased the sensitivity for detecting left circumflex coronary artery stenosis to 80% with a specificity of 55%, it did not achieve statistical significance when compared with qualitative wall motion analysis. 
Cerebrovascular hemodynamic changes associated with carotid endarterectomy. To evaluate the effect of carotid surgery on the cerebral circulation, transcranial Doppler sonography and ocular pneumoplethysmography were performed on 36 patients who underwent unilateral carotid endarterectomy. Ocular pneumoplethysmography and transcranial Doppler sonography tests were performed within a week before and after operation, and transcranial Doppler sonography was repeated greater than or equal to 30 days after operation. Middle and anterior cerebral arteries were insonated bilaterally, and flow velocities ipsilateral (iMCAFV or iACAFV) and contralateral (cMCAFV or cACAFV) to the side of surgery were recorded. The iMCAFV and iACAFV increased significantly in the immediate postoperative period, and the iMCAFV remained elevated on the second follow-up study. Patients with greater than or equal to 75% ipsilateral carotid stenosis (N = 23) had increased iMCAFV, iACAFV, and decreased cACAFV after operation, whereas those with less than 75% stenosis (N = 13) had no significant transcranial Doppler sonography changes. Those with greater than or equal to 75% contralateral carotid stenosis (N = 17) had significant increases in iMCAFV, cMCAFV, and iACAFV after operation, whereas those with less than 75% contralateral carotid stenosis had no significant transcranial Doppler sonography changes. A subset of patients (N = 13) did not increase iMCAFV after surgery. The ocular pneumoplethysmography changes were significantly different in both groups when preoperative and postoperative values were compared. We conclude that carotid endarterectomy can cause lasting cerebral hemodynamic changes, but that its effects are not uniform among all patients. 
Ischaemic myelopathy secondary to disseminated intravascular coagulation in AIDS. A 39-year-old patient with AIDS presented with a rapidly progressive myelopathy with a partial Brown-Sequard syndrome. He died, 9 weeks after onset of the first neurological signs, from diffuse encephalopathy. Neuropathological examination revealed multiple, usually small, frequently haemorrhagic, infarcts or various ages and numerous fibrin thrombi in medium and small penetrating vessels and capillaries of the brain and spinal cord, characteristic of disseminated intravascular coagulation. There were no inflammatory changes. Immunohistochemical studies for human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella zoster virus, herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 were negative. Ischaemic spinal cord lesions due to disseminated intravascular coagulation may represent an unusual cause of focal, non-inflammatory, non-tumoral, myelopathic syndrome in AIDS. 
Papaveretum infusions in infants under 6 months of age. The effectiveness of a continuous low dose papaveretum infusion for the relief of postoperative pain was assessed in 29 infants aged 1-6 months nursed on the infant surgical ward following major abdominal surgery. Trained nursing staff were able to adjust the dosage within prescribed guidelines and satisfactory analgesia was obtained with a regimen which delivered up to 0.0375 mg/kg/hour, approximately half the dose recommended in children older than 12 months. There was one case of clinically significant respiratory depression. 
Nonparallel effects of renin inhibitor treatment on plasma renin activity and angiotensins I and II in hypertensive subjects. An assay-related artifact. Nonparallel effects of renin inhibitor treatment on plasma renin activity (PRA) and the plasma levels of angiotensins (ANG), as well as on blood pressure, have been observed in subjects with hypertension. This study addresses the possibility that renin inhibitors may show a high degree of plasma protein binding in vivo and that displacement of protein-bound inhibitor during the assay of PRA in vitro may lead to overestimation of renin inhibition. Indeed, with the ultrafiltration technique it was found that 96% of the novel renin inhibitor Ro 42-5892, when added to EDTA plasma, was bound to protein. The angiotensinase inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 8-hydroxy-quinoline sulfate (8-OHQ), which are currently used in PRA assays, caused a displacement of protein-bound inhibitor, thereby increasing its free concentration. This displacement was sufficient to explain the reduction in IC 50 of Ro 42-5892, which was seen in the PRA assay when PMSF and 8-OHQ were added to plasma. Such reductions in IC 50 were also seen with the renin inhibitors CGP 29-287, CGP 38-560A, and SR 43-845. When Ro 42-5892 was given, 1 mg/kg intravenously in 10 min, to subjects with hypertension, it appeared that plasma ANG I and II returned to baseline after 6-8 h, whereas PRA measured in the presence of PMSF and 8-OHQ was still suppressed. However, when PRA was measured without these angiotensinase inhibitors, the inhibition of PRA was parallel to the suppression of ANG I and II. 
Internal mammary artery to lung parenchyma fistula after aortocoronary bypass grafting. Two unusual cases of internal mammary artery fistulization to lung parenchyma after coronary revascularization are reported. They were incidentally discovered during coronary angiography, and one of them was successfully closed with a percutaneous transvenous coil-spring occluder. The cause is thought to be the direct contact between the dissected mammary artery pedicle and the lung parenchyma. 
Quickscan: Doppler ultrasound emulation of angiography--its value prior to arteriography in peripheral vascular disease. The prevalence of peripheral vascular disease demands a quick, reliable, non-invasive technique for initial assessment. We have devised a new method which combines the two physical principles that (1) Doppler shift is proportional to blood velocity and (2) blood velocity is inversely proportional to arterial cross-section with the ability to track probe position using a non-contacting method. An image of the probe track and any arterial narrowing is shown superimposed on an outline of the patient. Pressure measurement, scan and graphics with final report take about 20 minutes. The accuracy of this system in peripheral vascular disease was evaluated. Thirty-one patients underwent quickscan (QS) and arteriography within an average time of 7 days. Abdominal aorta, common iliac-common femoral, superficial femoral and popliteal artery segments were graded independently as normal, significant stenosis (greater than 50% of diameter) or occluded by both techniques. Of 197 segments, QS correctly assessed 106 normal, 22 stenosed and 28 occluded segments. Four equivocal angiographic stenoses were normal on QS and three severe stenoses were graded occlusion. Fifteen segments on angiography and five on QS were not assessed. For the iliac and superficial femoral artery segments, sensitivity and specificity averaged 77% and 86%, respectively, for all grades. Aortic statistics were invalid (only one significant lesion). Six out of eight popliteal occlusions were correctly diagnosed by QS, but no popliteal stenoses were detected out of six shown on arteriography. Low numbers may contribute to this discrepancy but an improved popliteal scanning method may be necessary. We find initial QS an invaluable aid to direct percutaneous angiography and to indicate potential sites for angioplasty. 
Resection and reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts; operative technique. Preliminary results in 25 procedures and indications. Although carotid endarterectomy is the standard procedure, the purpose of this paper is to describe a new surgical technique and indicate its role in the surgery of cervical cerebrovascular disease. The technique consists of resection of the pathologic carotid artery bifurcation followed by its total replacement with a bifurcated thin-wall polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft constructed by the surgeon. Prosthetic graft reconstruction of the carotid bifurcation (PGRCB) was performed in 21 patients (25 procedures) from November 1984 to May 1987. Many patients were over 70 years old. The indications for surgery were transient ischemic attacks (TIA)'s in 10 patients (high-grade stenosis), established stroke with mild deficit in 3 patients (high-grade stenosis). Eight patients (high-grade stenosis) were asymptomatic and 4 had vertebro-basilar symptoms. In 11 procedures the indications were the same as for standard carotid endarterectomy (significant stenosis and/or ulcerated plaque). In 14 cases, the procedure was justified by extensive lesions involving a long segment of the internal carotid artery (2 restenoses, 12 calcified lesions). In the perioperative period, there were no deaths and no TIA's. The 25 procedures were assessed one month postoperatively by ultrasonic imaging and venous substraction angiography. All the grafts were patent with perfect restoration of the carotid bifurcation anatomy. Systematic follow-up study was carried out in 1987. Three patients had died of non-neurologic causes and one was lost to study. The remaining 19 procedures were evaluated with an average follow-up of 19 months (range 7 to 32 months). The patients were asymptomatic and all the grafts remained patent including one stenosis (greater than 50%) at the common carotid artery anastomosis. Because recent studies have documented a much higher rate of technical defects or recurrent stenosis after carotid endarterectomy, we believe that PGRCB merits consideration, particularly in difficult endarterectomies, and in recurrent carotid stenosis. Furthermore it seems acceptable to advocate PGRCB in aneurysms of the internal carotid artery and in post-irradiation arteritis. 
Structural abnormalities of the craniofacial complex and congenital malformations. This article was meant to be a very cursory survey of the multiple defects that abnormal development can produce in all areas of the craniofacial complex. Careful examination for these abnormalities should lead the clinician to earlier referral of patients for additional examination by a genetics team. This often enables more focused care for the individual and better counseling concerning future pregnancies. Aase points out that "funny looking face" or "syndromic facies" is no longer helpful. Accurate assessment of the face with measurement leads to better diagnosis and ultimately better patient care. All children with facial defects deserve early intervention by a multidisciplined craniofacial team including geneticists, surgeons, dentists, speech pathologists, and other specialists. Part of the process of early referral to this team involves early detection and recognition in the neonatal period. It is hoped that this article stimulates the pediatrician to be aware of these abnormalities, recognize their importance, and seek additional help for patients, no matter what their age. 
Immaturity and aneuploidy in human oocytes after different stimulation protocols. OBJECTIVE: To study immaturity and aneuploidy in human oocytes after two different stimulation protocols. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Outpatient IVF clinic/laboratory. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-three patients of whom 65 were stimulated with clomiphene citrate (CC)/human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and 78 were stimulated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a)/hMG. Only patients with at least one oocyte unfertilized were included in this study. RESULTS: Stimulation with GnRH-a/hMG, as compared with CC/hMG stimulation, resulted in larger numbers of oocytes (P less than 0.00001), a higher fertilization rate (P less than 0.02), and oocyte retrieval at a later average cycle day (P less than 0.000005). Cytogenetic findings of immaturity were observed in 33.9% of unfertilized oocytes after CC/hMG stimulation, compared with only 17.8% after GnRH-a/hMG stimulation (P less than 0.0005). Aneuploidy findings were the same for both groups. CONCLUSION: In GnRH-a/hMG stimulation, oocytes approach the normal day of ovulation more closely. This may allow for better oocyte maturation and higher fertilization and pregnancy rates. 
Comparison of intravenous bolus injection or continuous infusion of recombinant single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (saruplase) for thrombolysis. A canine model of combined coronary arterial and femoral venous thrombosis. The thrombolytic efficacy of recombinant unglycosylated full length single chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA, saruplase), applied either as single intravenous bolus or as a continuous infusion over 60 minutes, was studied in 5 randomized blinded groups of 5 dogs with combined copper coil induced coronary artery thrombosis and 125I-fibrin labeled femoral vein clots. Infusion of 1 mg/kg recu-PA (group I) induced coronary recanalization in 4 of 5 dogs and 98 +/- 1% (mean +/- SEM) venous clot lysis. Bolus injection of 1 mg/kg recu-PA (group II) caused reflow in 3 of 5 dogs and 88 +/- 5 percent venous clot lysis. Infusion of 0.5 mg/kg rescu-PA (group III) achieved reflow in 3 of 5 dogs and 52 +/- 6% venous clot lysis. Bolus injection of 0.5 mg/kg rscu-PA (group IV) induced reflow in 4 of 5 dogs and 48 +/- 12% venous clot lysis. Placebo infusion (group V) was associated with late recanalization in 1 of 5 dogs and 18 +/- 8% venous clot lysis. Coronary artery reocclusion after reflow was not observed in groups I and II, but occurred in 2 of 3 animals in group III and in 3 of 4 animals in group IV (P = .02). The time to reflow in responsive animals was 22 +/- 5 minutes with infusion of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg rscu-PA and 14 +/- 1 minute with bolus injection of 0.5 or 1 mg/kg (P = .14). Depletion of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin to less than 25% of baseline levels was observed in the 5 dogs given 1 mg/kg rscu-PA by bolus and in 3 of the 5 dogs given 1 mg/kg rscu-PA via infusion, but in none of the dogs that received 0.5 mg/kg rscu-PA (P less than .001). Plasma clearance rates were 170 +/- 44 and 230 +/- 30 mL/minute after bolus injection and 190 +/- 47 and 310 +/- 56 mL/minute during infusion of rscu-PA for the 1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg doses respectively. Thus, intravenous bolus injection of rscu-PA (saruplase) appears to be equipotent to an infusion over 60 minutes for both coronary and venous thrombolysis. This animal model of combined arterial and venous thrombolysis may be useful for the evaluation of new thrombolytic strategies. 
Adrenal carcinoma presenting with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. A 63-year-old woman presented with a 3-day history of vaginal bleeding. Pelvic examination and ultrasound revealed bilateral atrophy of the ovaries and a uterus of 8.8 x 3.3 x 4.0 cm. Serum estradiol (E2) was 300 pg/mL. Cushing syndrome was diagnosed biochemically, and computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a 5-cm left adrenal mass and tumors in the liver and lung. A pathologic diagnosis of metastatic adrenal carcinoma was made after surgery. This case demonstrates that adrenal carcinoma can produce high E2 levels in a postmenopausal woman, leading to uterine enlargement and vaginal bleeding. Adrenal carcinoma should therefore be included in the differential diagnosis of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. 
Plasma endothelin in human essential hypertension. Plasma endothelin immunoreactivity was measured in normal controls, in mild essential hypertensive patients with no antihypertensive treatment, in moderate to severe hypertensives whose blood pressure was controlled by treatment, and in moderate to severe hypertensives whose blood pressure was not controlled by treatment. Endothelin immunoreactivity levels in plasma in the four groups were similar, but had a positive correlation with blood pressure in hypertensives although not in normotensives. The concentration in plasma of both C-terminal and N-terminal atrial natriuretic peptide also had a positive correlation with blood pressure in these hypertensive patients. We conclude that if plasma immunoreactive endothelin levels represent the result of endothelial production of endothelin, in absence of changes in catabolism of the peptide, essential hypertensive patients do not appear to have increased production of endothelin. 
Effects of ultrasound and trolamine salicylate phonophoresis on delayed-onset muscle soreness. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of ultrasound and phonophoresis using an anti-inflammatory-analgesic cream (trolamine salicylate) on delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Repeated eccentric contractions were used to induce DOMS in the elbow flexors of 40 college-aged women. Subjects were then assigned randomly to one of four groups: (1) group 1 (n = 10) received sham ultrasound using placebo cream, (2) group 2 (n = 10) received sham ultrasound using trolamine salicylate cream, (3) group 3 (n = 10) received ultrasound using placebo cream, and (4) group 4 (n = 10) received ultrasound using trolamine salicylate cream. Subjects were treated on 3 consecutive days. Muscle soreness and active elbow range of motion were assessed daily prior to each treatment. The subjects in group 3 experienced an increase in DOMS, whereas no increase in soreness was observed in the subjects in group 4. The authors concluded that ultrasound enhanced the development of DOMS but that this enhancement was offset by the anti-inflammatory-analgesic action of salicylate phonophoresis. These findings suggest that salicylate phonophoresis may be useful in clinical situations in which it is desirable to administer ultrasound without increasing inflammation. 
Insulin and glucagon levels in fulminant hepatic failure in man. The behavior of insulin and glucagon and related metabolic substrates was assayed in plasma of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. All 12 subjects were provided the same nutritional support. High levels of insulin and glucagon were present at all times and no difference was observed between surviving patients (four) and those who died (8). Elevated values for branched-chain and aromatic amino acids as well as alanine were present. Statistically significant lower levels of aromatic amino acids and consequently a greater branched chain-aromatic amino acid ratio was found in surviving vs nonsurviving patients. A significantly greater level of alpha-fetoprotein was found in patients who survived as compared to those who died. 
Flecainide in the treatment of fetal tachycardias. Fourteen mothers were treated with flecainide for fetal atrial tachycardias associated with intrauterine cardiac failure. Twelve of the 14 fetuses responded by conversion to sinus rhythm. One of the 12 fetuses subsequently died in utero. The remaining fetuses suffered no morbidity and were alive and well 3 months to 2 years after delivery. The two fetuses in whom atrial tachycardia did not convert with flecainide were successfully treated with digoxin. These results compare favourably with previous forms of antiarrhythmic treatment. After recent reports of the side effects of flecainide treatment, however, it has been advised that this drug should be confined to high risk patients and those with life threatening arrhythmias. The use of flecainide for fetal arrhythmias should be limited to patients with severe fetal hydrops and supraventricular tachycardias. It should not be the first drug of choice in atrial flutter. 
The study of serum apoprotein levels as indicators for the severity of angiographically assessed coronary artery disease. Serum apoprotein A-I (Apo A-I) and B (Apo-B) concentrations were determined in 40 subjects undergoing coronary angiography for past myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, and the authors studied the relationship between the apoprotein concentrations and the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD). During this study, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were determined to control analysis. The results showed that the decrease in serum Apo A-I levels was the best indicator distinguishing CAD from non-coronary artery disease; the Apo B/Apo A-I ratio had the most consistent association with the severity of CAD as assessed by angiography; Apo B/Apo A-I values ranging from 0.98 to 1.00 might be considered critical values for early CAD. 
Cost effectiveness of incremental programmes for lowering serum cholesterol concentration: is individual intervention worth while? OBJECTIVE--To evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of various cholesterol lowering programmes. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis. SETTING--Norwegian cholesterol lowering programme in Norwegian male population aged 40-49 (n = 200,000), whose interventions comprise a population based promotion of healthier eating habits, dietary treatment (subjects with serum cholesterol concentration 6.0-7.9 mmol/l), and dietary and drug treatment combined (serum cholesterol concentration greater than or equal to 8.0 mmol/l). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Marginal cost effectiveness ratios--that is, the ratio of net treatment costs (cost of treatment minus savings in treatment costs for coronary heart disease) to life years gained and to quality of life years (QALYs) saved. RESULTS--The cost per life year gained over 20 years of a population based strategy was projected to be 12 pounds. For an individual strategy based on dietary treatment the cost was about 12,400 pounds per life year gained and 111,600 pounds if drugs were added for 50% of the subjects with serum cholesterol concentrations greater than or equal to 8.0 mmol/l. CONCLUSIONS--The results underline the importance of marginal cost effectiveness analyses for incremental programmes of health care. The calculations of QALYs, though speculative, indicate that individual intervention should be implemented cautiously and within more selected groups than currently recommended. Drugs should be reserved for subjects with genetic hypercholesterolaemia or who are otherwise at very high risk of arteriosclerotic disease. 
Congestive gastropathy and Helicobacter pylori: an endoscopic and morphometric study. Congestive gastropathy is a frequent cause of upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage in patients with portal hypertension. The pathogenesis is thought to involve venous congestion with gastric mucosal capillary dilatation. We studied the relation between gastric mucosal capillary dilatation, measured morphometrically, and endoscopic appearances in 74 patients with portal hypertension and 20 control subjects. We also investigated the frequency of gastric colonisation with Helicobacter pylori. Mucosal capillaries in patients were significantly dilated compared with control subjects (p less than 0.001) but the degree of dilatation was not related to the severity of the endoscopic appearances. H pylori was identified in 19 of 74 (26%) patients but was not related to the severity of the endoscopic appearances. These results suggest that other factors in addition to mucosal venous and capillary congestion are important in the pathogenesis of endoscopic congestive gastropathy and that gastric colonisation with H pylori is unlikely to be one of these factors. 
Carotid and coronary atherosclerosis. What are the connections? In recent years research has revealed an association between carotid atherosclerosis and coronary atherosclerosis that parallels the long-recognized association between clinically manifest cerebrovascular disease and clinically manifest coronary artery disease (CAD). Validation of B-mode ultrasonography as a method for quantitative imaging of the extracranial carotid arteries has made it possible to identify risk factors for extracranial carotid atherosclerosis and its progression and to test pharmacologic agents for their ability to retard that progression. Extent of atherosclerosis in the extracranial carotid arteries has been shown to be a risk factor or "marker" for symptomatic CAD. In addition, CAD has been identified as an important predictor of progression of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis. 
Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis. Neurologic syndromes often complicate the management of infective endocarditis (IE). We retrospectively reviewed 166 episodes of native valve endocarditis to assess the occurrence and implications of nonfocal encephalopathy, meningitis, salient headache, back pain, and brain abscess. Neurologic complications occurred in 35% (58/166) of patients: 41% (54/133) of mitral or aortic valve IE and 12% (4/33) of tricuspid valve IE. Of 133 cases of mitral or aortic valve IE, encephalopathy occurred in 14%, meningitis in 5%, and salient headache in 3%. All neurologic complications occurred more often with Staphylococcus aureus infection (67%) than with viridans streptococci (22%), including encephalopathy (22% versus 7%), meningitis (17% versus 0%), stroke (39% versus 16%), and death (39% versus 9%). Encephalopathy was associated with virulent organisms, increased patient age, and uncontrolled infection. Clinical, radiologic, and neuropathologic data all suggest that infective microemboli are often etiologic in IE-related encephalopathy. There were no macroscopic brain abscesses clinically identified. Meningitis occurred only with virulent organisms. While many clinical aspects of IE have changed in recent years, the frequency and gravity of neurologic complications have not. 
Cytogenetic abnormalities in uterine leiomyomata. Uterine leiomyomata are thought to be monoclonal tumors; however, the factors involved in the neoplastic proliferation of uterine leiomyomata are unknown. The purpose of the present study was to characterize uterine leiomyomata using cytogenetic techniques. Thirteen leiomyoma specimens were obtained by hysterectomy or myomectomy. Short-term cultures were successfully established for all specimens, and metaphase spreads were prepared by conventional techniques. Clonal chromosome rearrangements were detected in seven leiomyoma specimens (54%). These rearrangements involved chromosome bands 12q14-15 in five specimens, including three tumors with a specific translocation, t(12;14)(q14-15;q23-24). Chromosome rearrangements involving chromosome band 7q22 were identified in two specimens. A normal 46,XX karyotype was observed in six specimens. Myometrial specimens from two patients with abnormal leiomyoma karyotypes were normal cytogenetically. These results suggest that spontaneous chromosome rearrangements may be responsible for the initiation and proliferation of leiomyoma growth. 
Composite tissue transfer in limb-salvage surgery. After extensive resection due to extremity sarcoma, the inability to cover the defect for satisfactory healing and limb function has been an indication for amputation rather than limb salvage. We report herein our experience with seven limb-salvage cases in which we closed difficult and complex defects with composite tissue transfers utilizing microvascular techniques. Free-flap transfers were used to cover soft-tissue defects after extensive resection of primary and locally recurrent tumor and to manage radiation-induced complications. The grafts healed well when infected irradiated tissue was covered, and the grafts tolerated postoperative irradiation. Composite tissue transfer also provided soft-tissue coverage around distal joints that would not have been adequately protected with a skin graft. Complications were minimal, and all patients maintained good extremity function. No patient who underwent composite tissue transfer has had a local recurrence. A free-flap composite tissue transfer can extend the indications for limb-salvage surgery and offers an alternative to amputation in selected patients. 
Nitroprusside in preeclampsia. Circulatory distress and paradoxical bradycardia. In severe preeclampsia, short-term peripartum management of hypertension with hydralazine is complicated by relatively prolonged hypotensive episodes, resulting in fetal distress. We hypothesized that nitroprusside's rapid onset and brief antihypertensive action would permit more controlled blood pressure reduction. Nitroprusside was infused into 10 invasively monitored subjects until mean arterial pressure either 1) was gradually reduced 10-20% or 2) fell abruptly. Subjects fell into two groups, defined by whether the hypotensive effect of nitroprusside was accompanied by a fall in heart rate (group A, n = 8) or a rise (group B, n = 2). Group B showed the expected sinoaortic baroreceptor reflex elevations in heart rate (+17 +/- 6 beats/min) in response to moderate falls in mean arterial pressure (-32 +/- 9 mm Hg) elicited by moderate doses (1.03 +/- 0.23 micrograms/kg/min). However in group A, steep reductions in mean arterial pressure (-75 +/- 22 mm Hg, p less than 0.0001), significantly greater than in group B (p less than 0.05), occurred at much lower doses (0.35 +/- 0.23 micrograms/kg/min; p less than 0.05) and were accompanied by falls in heart rate (-21 +/- 7 beats/min). The apparently paradoxical falls in heart rate and extreme hypotensive responses in group A indicate severe circulatory compromise, corresponding to the cardiac and vasomotor depression that characterizes severe hemorrhage and other forms of acute/severe hypovolemic hypotension. This hemodynamic pattern represents a cardiopulmonary baroreceptor reflex presumably related to the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. The appearance of this pattern in the present study probably reflects the imposition of nitroprusside's prominent venous dilator action on the relatively reduced blood volume that generally characterizes severe preeclampsia. 
Captopril protects against myocardial injury induced by magnesium deficiency. We have previously reported that antioxidant drug intervention protects against magnesium deficiency-induced myocardial lesions. In the present study, Golden Syrian male hamsters were fed either a magnesium-deficient diet or a magnesium-supplemented diet. Animals from each group received sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: captopril, epi-captopril (a stereoisomer of captopril), and zofenopril* (arginine blend of zofenopril containing a free SH group); another group of animals received the non-sulfhydryl-containing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat. The animals were killed after 14 days, and their hearts were isolated for morphological and morphometric analyses. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were examined by a computer image analysis system for a morphometric determination of the severity of myocardial injury. Captopril reduced both the density of lesions, from 0.32 to 0.08 lesions/(mm2) (p less than 0.01), and the area fraction of lesions, from 7.42 x 10(-4) to 2.03 x 10(-4) lesion area/(mm2) (p less than 0.01), as well as the degree of inflammatory infiltration around the blood vessels. Epi-captopril and zofenopril* were virtually equipotent to captopril, but enalaprilat afforded only slight (nonsignificant) protection. These results indicate that a significant component of the protective effect of captopril in this model was attributable to its sulfhydryl moiety, rather than solely due to the inhibition of the angiotensin converting enzyme. These data further support our previous findings of possible free radical participation in cardiomyopathy due to magnesium deficiency. 
A prospective randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy with bolus versus continuous infusion of doxorubicin in patients with high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcoma and an analysis of prognostic factors. A prospective randomized trial was conducted to compare the cardiotoxic and therapeutic effects of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks) administered by bolus or 72-hour continuous infusion as adjuvant chemotherapy in 82 eligible patients after resection of high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or superficial trunk. Cardiac toxicity, defined as a 10% or greater decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction as assessed by radionuclide cineangiography, was evaluated in 69 patients. Cardiotoxicity was seen in 61% of patients in the bolus treatment arm with the median doxorubicin dose of 420 mg/m2. Among patients who received continuous infusion, 42% had cardiotoxicity with a median dose of 540 mg/m2. The rate of cardiotoxicity as a function of the cumulative dose of doxorubicin was significantly higher in the bolus treatment arm (P = 0.0017). Two patients in each group had clinical congestive heart failure, with one cardiac death occurring in each. There was a trend toward a lower rate of metastasis (P = 0.19) and a significantly lower rate of death of disease (P = 0.036) for patients treated with the bolus dose. Cox model analysis identified three unfavorable characteristics for the rate of developing a distant metastasis: blood transfusion within 24 hours of operation (P less than 0.00001), tumor deep to the fascia and 5 cm or more in size (P = 0.0043), and a histologic subtype other than liposarcoma (P = 0.0002). The unfavorable effect of continuous infusion was not selected in the model (P = 0.16). Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with soft tissue sarcoma is investigational. Furthermore, the impact of perioperative blood transfusion merits further study. 
Influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on pump function and cardiac contractility in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Eleven patients with coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure were studied before and three months after the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril was added to their frusemide medication. The following were measured: left ventricular pressure and volume with transient occlusion of the inferior vena cava, radionuclide angiography, and hormone concentrations in plasma. As in other reported studies, the clinical condition of the patients improved and their exercise tolerance increased moderately. Addition of enalapril reduced end diastolic and systolic pressure, reduced ventricular volume, and concomitantly increased the ejection fraction. The end systolic pressure-volume relation shifted to the left as it did in a similar animal study. In the animal study unloading by a vasodilator did not induce a leftward shift, so it can be inferred that in the present study unloading combined with a decrease in the angiotensin concentration was instrumental in remodelling the heart. Though unloading was expected to have a beneficial effect on the oxygen supply/demand ratio of the heart, the patients still showed the same drop in the ejection fraction during exercise as they did before treatment with enalapril, and early diastolic filling did not improve. Normally, regression of cardiac dilatation is only found if pump function improves; the present study showed that unloading in combination with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition reshapes the ventricle without improving intrinsic pump function. 
Feeding regimens after pyloromyotomy. In a prospective randomized study three different feeding regimens after operation were compared in 74 babies with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: gradual regarding of feeds over 48 h (regimen 1), rapid regarding of feeds over 16 h (regimen 2), and initial starvation followed by full normal feeds at 24 h (regimen 3). No significant difference between the treatment groups was found either in episodes of vomiting after operation (regimen 1, 2.9 episodes in 21 patients; regimen 2, 3.6 episodes in 28 patients; regimen 3, 3.6 episodes in 25 patients) or in the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay (regimen 1, 59.3 h; regimen 2, 47.8 h; regimen 3, 56.7 h). We conclude that vomiting following pyloromyotomy is self-limiting and independent of the timetable or composition of the postoperative dietary regimen. 
Emergency treatment of headache. Headache is a frequent presenting complaint in the emergency department. Once a diagnosis is established, and significant organic disease can be ruled out, relief of pain must be addressed. Referral for follow-up care and narcotic habituation is a recurrent problem for the emergency physician. This article discusses the differential diagnosis of headache, evaluation of the emergency room patient, and treatment of the patient with headache. 
Neutrophils express the high affinity receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RI, CD64) after in vivo application of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Fc receptors are important effector molecules of neutrophilic granulocytes (polymorphonuclear neutrophils [PMN]), connecting phagocytic cells and the specific immune response. Neutrophils from healthy donors express the low-affinity receptors for IgG Fc gamma RII (CD32) and Fc gamma RIII (CD16), but not the high-affinity receptor Fc gamma RI (CD64). The latter has been found on neutrophils from patients with certain bacterial infections and can be induced in vitro after incubation with interferon-gamma. We show here that neutrophils strongly express Fc gamma RI after in vivo application of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF). PMN from patients receiving rhG-CSF displayed higher cytotoxicity against Daudi lymphoma cells in vitro compared with control patients and with healthy donors. Fab fragments against Fc gamma RII (monoclonal antibody [MoAb] IV.3) inhibited neutrophil-mediated cytotoxicity of healthy donors but not of patients during rhG-CSF therapy. Therefore, expression of Fc receptors by PMN was investigated by flow cytometry and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was compared. After staining with MoAb 32.2 against Fc gamma RL, the median MFI of neutrophils from G-CSF patients (median, 4.78; range, 2.40 to 8.50; n = 5) was significantly higher (P = .002 and P = .001, respectively) than the median MFI of patients not receiving G-CSF (median, 1.23; range, 1.01 to 1.58; n = 6) and the median MFI of healthy donors (median, 1.04; range, 0.67 to 1.12; n = 6). Fc gamma RI disappeared after the discontinuing of the G-CSF injections, but was reinduced during the next treatment cycle with rhG-CSF. The high expression of Fc gamma RI during rhG-CSF therapy correlated with enhanced cytotoxicity. In vitro incubation with rhG-CSF also enhances cytotoxicity, but only minor increments in Fc gamma RI expression were observed. Thus, during in vivo application of rhG-CSF neutrophils acquire an additional potent receptor for mediating tumor cell killing in vitro by induction of the high-affinity receptor for IgG (Fc gamma RI, CD64). 
Management of intraoperative rupture of aneurysm without hypotension. A retrospective analysis was performed on all aneurysms operated on by one of us (SLG) from July 1980 to October 1988 to determine the factors that govern outcome from the intraoperative rupture of aneurysms. A total of 276 consecutive surgical procedures for 317 intracranial aneurysms produced 41 perioperative or intraoperative ruptures for analysis. Five cases were pre-exposure ruptures, 3 of which occurred during anesthetic induction. Four of these patients died, and 1 made a good recovery. Of the remaining 36 cases, outcome was analyzed in terms of the adjuncts used to deal with the intraoperative rupture. There was no statistically significant difference in outcome between those cases in which tamponade was used to control hemorrhage versus temporary clipping; however, those cases in which hypotension was used did less well than those in which it was not used. From October 1986 to October 1988, 108 operations for 132 aneurysms were performed without the use of induced hypotension. There were 16 intraoperative ruptures (14.8%). All 16 of these patients made a good recovery. In the group before 1986, of which there were 20 intraoperative ruptures (of 168 operations, 11.9%), 11 of those 20 patients suffered a permanent deficit or died. We conclude that hypotension may not be a necessary adjunct to the management of intraoperative rupture of aneurysms. 
Vaccination for prevention of CAPD associated staphylococcal infection: results of a prospective multicentre clinical trial. 124 stable CAPD patients from 8 Australian and 3 New Zealand centers were randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to one of two groups to study the effect of vaccination using commercial preparations consisting of a combined staphylococcus toxoid and whole killed staphylococci (SB) or normal saline solution (SS) on the incidence of peritonitis and exit site infection and S. aureus nasal carriage over a 12-month prospective period. In addition, levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 were monitored during the trial period in serum and dialysate; serum levels of anti-alpha hemolysin and dialysate levels of fibronectin and specific antistaphylococcal antibodies were also measured. Over the period, treatment with SB or SS did not affect the incidence of peritonitis, catheter-related infection or S. aureus nasal carriage. However, vaccination with SB elicited a significant increase in the level of serum anti-alpha hemolysin throughout the 12 month duration of the study, although the level of increase was unrelated to the subsequent rate of peritonitis. Vaccination with SB but not SS elicited a significant increase in the dialysate level of specific antibodies against S. aureus. Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and C4 were within the normal range in the CAPD patients studied and remained unaffected by vaccination with SB. In addition, dialysate levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and C4 were 50-100 times lower than corresponding serum levels and remained unaffected by vaccination. In summary, immunisation with an anti-staphylococcal agent was not successful in reducing peritonitis or exit site infection in CAPD patients. 
Transfusion-related chronic liver disease in sickle cell anemia. The medical records and liver biopsies of nine sickle cell patients with chronically elevated liver function tests were retrospectively reviewed to determine the etiology of chronic liver disease. There were eight women and one man with a mean age of 30 yr. All patients had hemoglobin SS. Eight patients were referred for elevated aminotransferases and one for an elevated alkaline phosphatase. Hemosiderosis was present in all of the biopsies. Two patients had cirrhosis. Chronic hepatitis was noted in two patients, and five patients had cholestasis. Two patients had serologic markers demonstrating HBV exposure but no patients were HBsAg positive. Erythrophagocytosis, sinusoidal dilatation, and Kupffer cell hyperplasia were present in all of the liver biopsies. Transfusion-related causes were the most common significant pathologic findings in our patients, and appeared to be the etiologies of chronic liver disease in sickle cell patients. 
The effects of L-dopa on excessive daytime sleepiness in narcolepsy. We examined the effects of L-dopa on the excessive daytime sleepiness of six narcoleptic patients while using a double-blind design and objective measurements of vigilance. The two treatment periods, L-dopa or placebo, lasted for 2 weeks each, separated by a 1-week washout period. In addition to the standard Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), two different tests assessed the daytime vigilance: the Analogue Vigilance Scale (AVS) and the Four Choice Reaction Time Test (FCRTT). L-dopa improved vigilance and performance as evaluated by the AVS and the FCRTT, while the capacity to fall asleep rapidly remained unchanged as evaluated by the MSLT. Results of the present study suggest that L-dopa is effective in improving the vigilance level of narcoleptic patients and raises the hypothesis that dopamine may play a role in the physiopathology of excessive daytime sleepiness of this condition. 
Extremely high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels at second-trimester screening. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening is widely used for the detection of open neural tube defects (NTDs) and a variety of other anomalies and complications. We examined the outcomes of 44 pregnancies with MSAFP elevations of 8 or more multiples of the median (MoM) from among 40,676 screened pregnancies. At the initial evaluation by ultrasound, 82% of the patients had at least one finding that may have accounted for the elevation. Approximately 45% of the fetuses had a major fetal anomaly, 25% died, 16% had an identifiable placental abnormality, and 5% had an underestimation of gestational age; 18% of the elevations remained unexplained after ultrasound. In follow-up of the pregnancies, all of those with an unexplained elevation after initial ultrasound had at least one obstetric complication or placental abnormality. The overall positive predictive value of an MSAFP value of 8 or more MoM for NTDs was 22.7%. The proportion of infants born alive in the overall group was low, with only 16 live births among 46 fetuses. The majority of the nonviable outcomes were associated with a fetus with a major anomaly that was terminated or died before 20 weeks. Of the live-born infants, 31% had a major anomaly, 19% had intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and an anomaly, 12.5% had IUGR without an anomaly, and 25% were preterm. Eighty-eight percent of those pregnancies with a live-born infant had at least one obstetric complication. Among pregnancies with MSAFP of 8 or more MoM, the majority are associated with large structural fetal anomalies or fetal death before 20 weeks. 
Bone marrow dosimetry in rats using direct tissue counting after injection of radio-iodinated intact monoclonal antibodies or F(ab')2 fragments. Normal rats were injected intravenously with 131I- and 125I-labeled intact murine and chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibodies directed against carcinoembryonic antigen or with the corresponding F(ab')2 fragments. At different times after injection, individual animals were killed and radioactivity of blood and major organs, including bones and bone marrow, was determined. Ratios comparing radioactivity concentration in different tissues with that of bone marrow were calculated and found to remain stable during several effective half-lives of the antibodies. Mean bone marrow radioactivity was 35% (range, 29%-40%) of that of blood and 126% (range, 108%-147%) of that of liver after injection of intact Mabs or F(ab')2 fragments. In nude rats bearing human colon carcinoma xenografts producing carcinoembryonic antigen, relative bone marrow radioactivity was slightly lower than that in normal rats. 
A comparative trial of the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Outcome in 3- to 8-month-old infants, 9- to 23-month-old infants and children, and 24- to 30-month-old children. The reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids were compared in 139 infants aged 3 to 8 months, 60 infants and children aged 9 to 23 months, and 99 children aged 24 to 30 months. Good antibody responses to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and agglutinogens occurred in all age groups after both the third and fourth doses. After the fourth (booster) dose, the mean antibody values in initially seronegative infants vaccinated at 3 to 8 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 67.8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU) per milliliter; anti-FHA, 149.5 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 125.6. The values in initially seronegative children vaccinated at 24 to 30 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 92.9 EU/mL; anti-FHA, 251.7 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 275.8. Reactions following immunization were minimal. Except for drowsiness after the first dose in infants, there were no clinically significant differences in reactions between infants and older children. The findings in this study coupled with the recent demonstration of efficacy of this vaccine in 2-year-old children supports the recent Japanese recommendation to lower the age of immunization with acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids to 3 months. 
Interleukin-2 induces early multisystem organ edema mediated by neutrophils. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), an agent known to activate neutrophils (PMN) with thromboxane (Tx)B2 release, produces pulmonary edema within 6 hours of intravenous infusion. This study tests the role of PMN in mediating the edema. Anesthetized rats received 10(6)U recombinant human IL-2 (n = 15) or vehicle (n = 14) as a constant intravenous infusion during a period of 1 hour. At this time there was leukopenia 3.63 +/- 0.43 (x10(3)/mm3) relative to vehicle-infused control rats 6.12 +/- 0.86 and a decline in PMN, 2.19 +/- 0.14 relative to control value of 3.33 +/- 0.05 (both p less than 0.05). After 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in the wet to dry weight (W/d) ratio, was present in the lungs (4.93 +/- 0.20 relative to control 4.06 +/- 0.10), heart (4.09 +/- 0.11 versus 3.76 +/- 0.08), liver (3.50 +/- 0.10 versus 3.18 +/- 0.10), and kidney (4.25 +/- 0.07 versus 4.00 +/- 0.07) (all p less than 0.05). There was increased lung permeability demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to control 460 +/- 90 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). Interleukin-2 resulted in lung PMN sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma TxB2 levels to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL relative to control 481 +/- 93 pg/mL (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment of other rats (n = 8) with selective anti-rat neutrophil antiserum 18 hours before the experiment led to a peripheral PMN count 10% of baseline and prevented edema in the lungs (W/d ratio 4.20 +/- 0.16) and heart (3.67 +/- 0.07) (both p less than 0.05) but not liver or kidney. Protein in lung lavage was reduced to 760 +/- 220 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). The protection afforded by leukopenia was associated with lack of PMN sequestration and prevention of the increase in plasma Tx levels (484 +/- 120 pg/mL, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the rapid induction of lung and heart edema with a 1-hour infusion of IL-2 in the rat is mediated, in large part, by activated PMNs. 
Prevalences of diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk factors in Hindu Indian subcommunities in Tanzania. OBJECTIVES--To seek differences in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and other coronary heart disease risk factors, and to identify factors associated with these differences within a Hindu Indian community. DESIGN--Population based cross sectional survey. SETTING--Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania. SUBJECTS--Of 20 Hindu subcommunities categorised by caste in Dar-es-Salaam, seven were randomly selected. 1147 (76.7%) of 1495 subjects aged 15 or over participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood glucose concentrations (fasting and two hours after oral glucose loading), serum total cholesterol and serum triglyceride concentrations, blood pressure, and height and weight. RESULTS--The subcommunities differed substantially in socioeconomic characteristics and lifestyle. Overall, 9.8% of subjects (109/1113) had diabetes, 17.0% (189/1113) impaired glucose tolerance, 14.5% (166/1143) hypertension, and 13.3% (151/1138) were obese. The mean fasting blood glucose concentration was 4.9 mmol/l, the blood glucose concentration two hours after oral loading (75 g) 6.0 mmol/l, the total cholesterol concentration 4.9 mmol/l, the serum triglyceride concentration 1.4 mmol/l, and body mass index (weight/height: kg/m2) 24.3. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures were 121 and 77 mm Hg respectively. There were important intercommunity differences even after standardisation for age, sex, and body mass index--for example, in mean fasting blood glucose concentration (range 4.5 (Jains) to 5.9 mmol/l (Patels)), serum total cholesterol concentration (range 4.5 (Jains) to 6.2 mmol/l (Suthars)), systolic blood pressure (range 110 (Limbachias) to 127 mm Hg (Bhatias)), and prevalences of diabetes (range 3.4% (3/87 Limbachias) to 18% (20/111 Navnats)) and hypertension (range 5.7% (5/87 Limbachias) to 19.4% (43/222 Bhatias). Variables which showed significant linear correlation with subcommunity variations were entered into a multiple regression model. Intercommunity variations persisted. The Limbachia and Jain communities had the lowest prevalence of and mean values for coronary heart disease risk factors and the Bhatia and Patel communities had the highest. CONCLUSIONS--In this series intercommunity variations in disease and risk factors might have been related to genetic, dietary, socioeconomic, and lifestyle differences but could not be explained by the characteristics studied. Studies of Indian subcommunities are warranted to confirm and extend these descriptive findings and explore the genetic basis of diabetes. Communities of Indian origin should not be perceived as homogeneous. 
Differing patterns of striatal 18F-dopa uptake in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we studied regional striatal 18F-dopa uptake in 16 patients with L-dopa-responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), 18 patients with multiple system atrophy, and 10 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. Results were compared with those of 30 age-matched normal volunteers. The patients with PD showed significantly reduced mean uptake of 18F-dopa in the caudate and putamen compared to controls, but while function in the posterior part of the putamen was severely impaired (45% of normal), function in the anterior part of the putamen and in the caudate was relatively spared (62% and 84% of normal). Mean 18F-dopa uptake in the posterior putamen was depressed to similar levels in all patients. Unlike patients with PD, the patients with progressive supranuclear palsy showed equally severe impairment of mean 18F-dopa uptake in the anterior and posterior putamen. Caudate 18F-dopa uptake was also significantly lower in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy than in patients with PD, being depressed to the same level as that in the putamen. Mean 18F-dopa uptake values in the anterior putamen and caudate in patients with multiple system atrophy lay between PD and progressive supranuclear palsy levels. Locomotor disability of individual patients with PD or multiple system atrophy correlated with decline in striatal 18F-dopa uptake, but this was not the case for the patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We conclude that patients with PD have selective nigral pathological features with relative preservation of the dopaminergic function in the anterior putamen and caudate, whereas there is progressively more extensive nigral involvement in multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. 
Common complaints with cardiac implications in children. Chest pain, palpitations, and dizziness are not infrequent complaints in the office of a primary care physician. Historical events and physical findings can lead to a more accurate determination of cardiac causes of these symptoms. Electrocardiogram and chest radiographs are two additional tests most often helpful in determining cardiac causes of symptoms. 
Telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma of the extremities. Results in 17 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventeen patients with telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma (TOS) of the extremities were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to two different protocols. Preoperatively, the patients received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cisplatinum (CPD) (HD-MTX/CPD) and doxorubicin. CPD was delivered intraarterially, the other drugs intravenously. Limb-salvage surgery was performed in 12 instances, and five patients were treated with amputation. Postoperative chemotherapy was tailored according to the grade of chemotherapy-induced necrosis. In 13 cases (86%), the resultant grade of necrosis was greater than 90% (good responders). The mean follow-up interval was 3.5 years with a range of 18 to 78 months. Fourteen patients (82%) remained continuously disease-free, while three patients developed lung metastases. Two of these died because of uncontrolled disease, whereas the third patient is alive and disease-free after metastasectomy. No local recurrences were observed. These results are better than those observed in 215 contemporary cases of conventional osteosarcoma treated with the same protocols. This study confirms that TOS is not a uniformly lethal tumor as suggested by prior reports. By employing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a high percentage of patients with TOS can be cured, and in most of them, a limb-sparing surgery is possible and safe. 
Significance of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia on prostate needle biopsy. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) is a putative premalignant change in the human prostate. Previously, the spatial association of PIN with invasive carcinoma has been described in the study of total prostatectomies. PIN is frequently recognized in prostate needle biopsy specimens in which no carcinoma is apparent. To further define the potential significance of PIN, we performed repeat ultrasound-guided prostate needle biopsy in 21 men who had PIN identified on prostate biopsy performed because of an abnormal finding on digital rectal examination. Twelve patients (57%) had carcinoma identified on their second procedure including all who had intermediate- and high-grade PIN on the initial procedure. Prostate-specific antigen correlated with PIN grade and carcinoma on the secondary procedure, although this did not achieve statistical significance. Men with PIN on prostate needle biopsy should undergo repeat sampling to exclude missed carcinoma. 
Smoking and hypertension: risk factors for carotid stenosis. The prevalence of smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus was assessed in 221 patients suffering from internal carotid stenosis and compared with the prevalences in two sex- and age-matched control groups composed of subjects having normal Doppler findings and from non-neurological outpatients. Of the subjects with carotid stenosis 27.6% were hypertensive smokers in comparison with 9.5% and 17.2% in the two control groups. The difference of the stenosis cohort from the two control groups was significant (P less than 0.01 and P = 0.016 respectively). There was no statistically significant differences between the occurrence of diabetes and hypertension in non-smokers and patients who smoked. In 394 investigated patients suffering from carotid stenosis or occlusion an obstruction index, based on the Doppler shift frequency, was calculated. This index was lowest in the normotentive non-smokers. It was only insignificantly higher in the hypertensive non-smokers but significantly so in the normotensive smokers. The index was highest in the hypertensive non-smokers. It was concluded that cigarette smoking, especially if associated with hypertension, is a determinant risk factor for carotid stenosis and occlusion. 
Complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy. A prospective series with emphasis on the increased risk associated with sphincter of Oddi dysfunction and nondilated bile ducts. Mostly retrospective series with limited use of sphincter of Oddi manometry have indicated that early complications are more common when endoscopic sphincterotomy is performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction than for common duct stones. The current study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the frequency and type of complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction compared with endoscopic sphincterotomy performed for other conditions. Four hundred twenty-three patients underwent sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (166), common duct stone(s) (163), tumor (60), and miscellaneous reasons (34). Patients were observed in the hospital for at least 24 hours after the procedure, and 30-day follow-up data were obtained. The overall complication rate was 6.9%, but complications were more frequent when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction than for all other indications (10.8% vs. 4.3%; P = 0.009). Precut sphincterotomy was more frequently required in the sphincter of Oddi dysfunction group (21.1% vs. 11.7%, P = 0.009) but was no more likely to result in a complication (6.2%) than standard sphincterotomy. The risk of a complication was considerable for a small-diameter common bile duct (less than or equal to 5 mm), particularly when sphincterotomy was performed for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (37.5%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 1.7%, but the procedure-related mortality rate was believed to be 0.2%. It is concluded that endoscopic sphincterotomy for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction is more hazardous than for other conditions, particularly when a small common bile duct is present. 
Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in hepatolithiasis: A frequently overlooked disease. Five cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were found among 101 cases of hepatolithiasis. There was no definite sign of cholangiocarcinoma in ERCP and image studies of four cases. The possibility of the existence of occult cholangiocarcinoma should be kept in mind, especially when unusual presentations, such as body weight loss, anemia, palpable abdominal mass, and intractable pain, appear. An intraoperative frozen-section examination should be considered under the following circumstances: (1) whitish nodular mass over liver, (2) mucinous substance within bile duct, and (3) enlarged, firm lymph nodes clustered along the hepatic arteries and/or celiac arteries. 
Injury to the pre-pubertal vas deferens. I. Histological analysis of pre-pubertal human vas. There is very little information in the literature on the development of the human vas deferens. Therefore, the age at which the pre- or para-pubertal vas deferens becomes large enough for a vasovasostomy to be technically feasible is unknown. To determine the age or degree of sexual maturity at which a microscopic vasovasostomy is technically feasible, we collected surgical or autopsy vasa from 34 young males over a three year period, and correlated vasal size to age and Tanner stage (degree of sexual maturity ranging from 1-childhood to 5-adult). The specimens were embedded and sectioned transversely in glycol methacrylate. Using image analysis, the total transverse area and diameter, and luminal area and diameter was determined for each specimen. Surprisingly, there was no change in vasal size from birth up through 11 years. From age 15 years and on, the vas was adult in size. The vas develops to adult size between Tanner stages 2 and 3. The average external and luminal diameters of pre-midpuberty specimens (Tanner stages 1 and 2) were 1.0 and 0.19 (mm.) and the diameters of post-midpuberty specimens were 2.1 and 0.43 (mm.), respectively. These results suggest that, in the event of a recognized iatrogenic injury to the vas deferens after midpuberty, a repair by a traditional microsurgical vasovasostomy is possible. If the vas is injured before midpuberty it may be technically difficult to repair by traditional microsurgical methods. 
Functional, biochemical, and histopathologic consequences of high-dose interleukin-2 administration in rats. A variety of side effects have been reported with the use of interleukin-2 alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with disseminated neoplasms. The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of high-dose interleukin-2 administration in normal rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with intravenous recombinant interleukin-2 (900,000 IU/kg/day) for 9 consecutive days. Animals were placed in individual metabolic cages, and arterial blood pressure, food intake, body weight, and urine output were monitored. On day 10, animals were killed by exsanguination, various tissues were harvested, and a variety of hematologic and chemical assays were performed. The results were compared with those of placebo-injected normal control and pair-fed groups. The interleukin-2-treated group exhibited anorexia, weight loss, hypotension, anemia, leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, and a marked urinary concentration defect. Histologic examination of various tissues revealed widespread infiltration with mono-nuclear cells and eosinophils in most organs, especially in the lungs and liver of interleukin-2-treated animals. Other abnormalities included severe panlobular hepatitis, hepatocellular necrosis, and thymic involution. Renal involvement was mild and consisted of focal interstitial infiltration by mononuclear cells. According to these observations, administration of high-dose interleukin-2 in normal rats results in a score of significant functional, biochemical, and histologic abnormalities. 
Frequency of the hypercalcemia-leukocytosis syndrome in oral malignancies. There have been a number of reports over the last 15 years of patients with cancer who develop both leukocytosis and hypercalcemia, particularly in patients with cancers of the oral cavity. In this study, the authors report the frequency of hypercalcemia and leukocytosis in 225 patients with oral malignancies. Ten patients (4.4%) had hypercalcemia, 11 patients (4.9%) had leukocytosis, and five (2.2%) had both hypercalcemia and leukocytosis. The occurrence of these two distinct paraneoplastic syndromes in the same patients was greater than could have been expected from chance alone (chi-square = 45.8, P less than 0.0001). This study demonstrates that although hypercalcemia and leukocytosis are relatively uncommon in oral cancers, when they do occur they are frequently associated. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first report in which the frequency of the association hypercalcemia and leukocytosis is studied in detail in large numbers of patients with oral cancer. 
Lack of correlation between P pulmonale and right atrial overload in chronic obstructive airways disease. The correlation between P pulmonale and right atrial overload in chronic lung disease was studied. Right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and cardiac output were measured with a Swan-Ganz catheter in nine patients with chronic lung disease and P pulmonale on the electrocardiogram (P wave amplitude of greater than or equal to 2.5 mm (0.25 mV) in leads II, III, and a VF. The results were compared with those in six patients with an atrial septal defect (left to right shunt greater than or equal to 50%) and six patients with pulmonary hypertension (mean pressure greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg without left sided heart disease). Right atrial volume and wall thickness were measured in 10 cases of P pulmonale among 1000 necropsy cases and compared with 141 normal hearts from the same series. The patients with P pulmonale did not show a significant increase in right atrial or pulmonary artery pressures. None of the patients with an atrial septal defect or pulmonary hypertension had P pulmonale on the electrocardiogram. In the necropsy cases of P pulmonale mean (1 SD) in right atrial volume (32 (12) ml) and wall thickness (1.5 (0.7) mm) were not significantly increased (40 (14) ml and 1.4 (0.5) mm in the normal hearts). There was a significant inverse relation between the presence of P pulmonale and the cardiothoracic ratio. In all the patients with P pulmonale chest x ray showed a low cardiothoracic ratio, a considerably depressed diaphragm, and a pendulous heart. This study showed no correlation between P pulmonale and right atrial overload in chronic lung disease. 
Alteration of whole-body protein kinetics according to severity of surgical trauma in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition. This study was conducted to clarify the mechanisms of body nitrogen losses according to the severity of surgical trauma. Thirteen male patients who underwent operation for esophageal cancer (group E), and 11 men (who underwent gastric or colorectal surgeries (group GC) were studied. The measurement of whole-body protein turnover, synthesis, and breakdown were made preoperatively on the 3rd and 10th postoperative day with constant infusion of [15N]glycine during isocaloric and isonitrogenous total parenteral nutrition. Significant increases in the rates of whole-body protein turnover (flux) and breakdown were seen in group E on the 3rd postoperative day (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively), whereas the increases were not significant in group GC. The rates of whole-body protein flux and breakdown were significantly greater in group E than group GC (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively). The rate of protein synthesis significantly increased in group E (p less than 0.05), but did not alter or slightly decreased in group GC. The rates of whole-body protein flux and breakdown in group E were still significantly greater on the 10th postoperative day than preoperatively. It was concluded that unchanged or slightly decreased rates of whole-body protein synthesis with slightly increased breakdown were seen in the group of patients who underwent gastric or colorectal surgery, whereas synthesis increased significantly with a greater increase of breakdown in patients receiving severe surgical procedures, esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. 
Benefits of implantable defibrillators are overestimated by sudden death rates and better represented by the total arrhythmic death rate Benefits of the implantable defibrillator on survival were studied in 56 consecutive patients (concomitant coronary bypass or arrythmia surgery in 15) during an 8 year period between 1982 and 1990. During a follow-up period of 29 +/- 25 months, six patients had a sudden death and eight patients had a nonsudden cardiac death. Nonsudden cardiac deaths included three surgical deaths (death within 30 days after the surgery; two in patients without and one in a patient with concomitant cardiac surgery), one arrhythmia-related nonsudden death (death within 24 h after an arrhythmic event despite initial termination of the arrhythmia by the implantable defibrillators) and four nonarrhythmic cardiac deaths. The actuarial survival rate free of events at 1, 2 and 3 years was 96%, 96% and 92%, respectively, for sudden death, 91%, 91% and 87% for sudden death and surgical mortality and 89%, 89% and 85% for total arrhythmic death (sudden death, surgical mortality and arrhythmia-related nonsudden death). Thus, in patients treated with an implantable defibrillator, 1) the rate of sudden death is low (8% at 3 years); 2) 50% of nonsudden cardiac deaths are causally related to arrhythmia (surgical mortality or arrhythmia-related nonsudden death); 3) the total arrhythmic death rate is substantially higher than the sudden death rate; and 4) benefits of an implantable defibrillator are overestimated by reported sudden death and nonsudden cardiac death rates. The benefits may be better represented by the total arrhythmic death and nonarrhythmic cardiac death rates. 
Stroke from other etiologies masquerading as migraine-stroke. There has been a recent increase in the number of studies dealing with migraine-stroke. I describe five patients in whom migraine-stroke was the clinical diagnosis but in whom the subsequent clinical events or autopsy showed a different mechanism for the cerebral infarction. Three patients had arterial dissection (one proven at autopsy), one had marantic endocarditis that had been missed on two echocardiograms (proven at autopsy), and one had generalized atherosclerosis and diabetes. These patients demonstrate that important and different etiologies may produce what seems to be the migraine-stroke syndrome. The result may be failure to recognize specific therapeutic measures that could have vitally important benefit to the patient. 
Low peptic ulcer and high gastric cancer prevalence in a developing country with a high prevalence of infection by Helicobacter pylori. We compared the prevalence rates of peptic ulcer (duodenal and gastric) and gastric cancer in 1,796 dyspeptic Peruvian patients with those reported in 2,883 similar patients from developed countries. The prevalence of total peptic ulcer was significantly lower, and that of gastric cancer significantly higher, in the Peruvian patients. The prevalence of gastric ulcer was lower but not significantly so. We deduced that the significantly lower prevalence of total peptic ulcer was directly related to the low prevalence rate of duodenal ulcer. We hypothesize that the reason for these differences was probably a higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic atrophic gastritis with hypochlorhydria in the Peruvian patients. Hypochlorhydria decreases the predisposition to peptic ulcer (especially duodenal ulcer), and chronic atrophic gastritis may predispose an individual to gastric cancer. 
Clinical implications of late proven patency after successful coronary angioplasty. BACKGROUND. The introduction of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) has changed the pattern of intervention in coronary artery disease. However, the long-term results in patients undergoing successful, elective, native-vessel PTCA are not yet fully characterized. Because the healing and subsequent proliferative response after angioplasty are time related, it was the purpose of the present study to determine the long-term outcome in patients whose dilated arteries have been demonstrated to be patent 4-12 months after successful, uncomplicated PTCA. METHODS AND RESULTS. The patients were grouped on the basis of the 4-12 month catheterization into those whose vessels were angiographically "normal" or had luminal irregularities only at the PTCA sites (396 patients), those whose vessels also had luminal irregularities elsewhere with or without PTCA site luminal irregularities (680 patients), and those with significant obstructive disease (more than 50% diameter narrowing) at sites other than the PTCA sites (426 patients). Of 1,502 such patients, long-term follow-up was available in 1,491. At the time of the original angioplasty, the normal patients had a 1.8% incidence of multivessel disease; luminal irregularity patients, 9.4%; and obstructive disease patients, 58.7%. At angiographic restudy, 16.4% of the obstructive disease patients continued to have multivessel disease. The patients were followed for the events of death, myocardial infarction, coronary surgery, and repeat PTCA. The 6-year survival rate was 95%; cardiac survival, 96%; and freedom from all events, 65%. The strongest correlate of events during follow-up was the angiographic status of the undilated segments. At 6 years, freedom from cardiac events was noted in 77% of the normal group, 61% of the luminal irregularity group, and 55% of the obstructive disease group. Diabetes and hypertension were also independent correlates of events. CONCLUSIONS. Results from the present study show that associated disease in undilated segments is a strong predictor of late events in patients after successful, uncomplicated, reatenosis-free PTCA. However, the need for further revascularization was frequent even in patients without obstructive disease. Completeness of revascularization is appropriate when possible, and limiting progression of coronary disease at sites remote from those dilated should improve on these late results. 
Pressure therapy for the control of hypertrophic scar formation after burn injury. A history and review. Devastating functional problems can result from the formation of hypertrophic scar tissue after burn injury. Although a patient with burns may have several medical problems to contend with because of the injury, most ongoing rehabilitation difficulties are a consequence of the continual wound contraction that occurs in immature burn scars. Treatment of hypertrophic burn scar consists of several surgical options and of pressure therapy, which traditionally involves wearing garments made from elasticized fabric. This article reviews the treatment of hypertrophic scar tissue, with emphasis on its history and on nonsurgical methods of managing the burn scar. 
Repolarization inhomogeneities in ventricular myocardium change dynamically with abrupt cycle length shortening. BACKGROUND. In single heart cells, abrupt changes in stimulation rate elicit complex alterations in repolarization. The effects of rate change on dispersion of repolarization, however, have not been well characterized. METHODS AND RESULTS. To determine the effects of abrupt cycle length (CL) shortening on spatial inhomogeneity of repolarization in a syncytium of ventricular cells, 124 action potentials were simultaneously recorded from Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts using high-resolution optical mapping with voltage-sensitive dye. The distribution of ventricular action potential durations (APDs) mapped during each cardiac cycle was used to calculate mean APD and repolarization dispersion index (DI), defined as the variance of the distribution. After abruptly shortening CL from 500 to 300 msec, mean APD declined exponentially in normoxic controls (by 23 +/- 3 msec, p less than 0.0001). This response was characterized by beat-to-beat oscillations of APD that were synchronized at all ventricular sites. After 30 minutes of hypoxia, mean APD decreased from 175.0 +/- 13.3 to 76 +/- 25.7 msec. However, during hypoxia, abrupt CL shortening lowered mean APD by only an additional 6 +/- 6 msec, and APD oscillations were no longer synchronized throughout the ventricle. In controls, beat-to-beat DI decreased significantly (-51.0 +/- 6.8%, p less than 0.01) by the sixth post-CL shortening beat and then recovered (by 15-20 beats). In contrast, DI failed to decrease during hypoxia (+7.1 +/- 23%). Two mechanisms for the transient decline of DI in controls were identified: synchronous APD oscillations and transient diminution of the apical-to-basal ventricular APD gradient. CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that inhomogeneity of ventricular repolarization, as measured by DI, changes dynamically with CL shortening. Furthermore, the hypoxic ventricle does not attenuate DI after abrupt CL shortening and thereby lacks a physiological response expected to diminish vulnerability to arrhythmias. 
Physical activity on the job and cancer in Missouri. We conducted a series of case-control studies to investigate the risks of 16 cancer types in relation to occupational physical activity. These studies were based on Missouri Cancer Registry data for 17,147 White male cancer patients registered between 1984 and 1989. Colon cancer risk was increased for both the moderate (odds ratio (OR) = 1.1; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0, 1.3) and low (OR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.5) activity levels. Similar elevations were observed for prostate cancer at the moderate (OR = 1.1; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.3) and low (OR = 1.5; 95% CI = 1.2, 1.8) levels of activity, and for cancer of the testis at the low activity level (OR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.3, 3.7). An opposite trend (p less than 0.01) was noted for lung cancer, which showed decreased risk at the moderate (OR = 0.9; 95% CI = 0.8, 1.0) and low (OR = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.6, 0.9) activity levels. These associations suggest that further study of the relationship between physical activity and site-specific cancer risk is warranted. 
Interaction between free radicals and excitatory amino acids in the formation of ischemic brain edema in rats. Both oxygen free radicals and excitatory amino acids have been implicated as important cellular toxins in ischemic brain. Recent in vitro studies suggest that there may be a mutual interaction between these two mediators. We explored the relation between oxygen free radicals and excitatory amino acids in the development of ischemic brain edema in vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with the free radical scavenger dimethylthiourea 1 hour before ischemia or with the excitotoxin antagonist MK-801 30 minutes before ischemia produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Groups of seven or eight animals were treated with vehicle, low-dose (375 mg/kg) dimethylthiourea, high-dose (750 mg/kg) dimethylthiourea, low-dose (0.5 mg/kg) MK-801, high-dose (2.0 mg/kg) MK-801, or both high-dose dimethylthiourea and low-dose MK-801. After 4 hours of ischemia, brain water content was determined. In eight vehicle-treated controls, mean +/- SEM water content of tissue in the center of the ischemic zone was 83.29 +/- 0.18%. A significant reduction of brain edema was observed in all drug-treated groups: for example, 50.2% (p less than 0.001) in the high-dose dimethylthiourea group, 53.7% (p less than 0.001) in the low-dose MK-801 group, and 66.4% (p less than 0.001) in the combined dimethylthiourea and MK-801 group. Combined treatment with dimethylthiourea and MK-801 provided no significant additive effect over that resulting from treatment with MK-801 alone. 
Heart transplantation in children: an international survey. A survey of cardiac transplantation in children provided data from 381 transplantations in 362 patients from 32 centers in the United States and ten international centers. The number of transplantations continues to increase, in part because of transplantations in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and patients with congenital defects. The immunosuppression regimens were more uniform than in the 1985 survey, and triple therapy was most common. Actuarial survival rates were 85% at 1 month, 72% at 1 year, 64% at 3 years, and 60% at 5 years. However, these improved rates are still not equal to the survival of the overall cardiac transplant population, in part because of lower survival rates in neonates. Ventricular dysfunction and rejection, rather than infection, were the leading causes of death. Rejection and infection were the most frequent complications. Also common were hypertension (39%) and seizures (25%), whereas coronary artery disease (8%) was unusual. Functional results were excellent in 85%, and only 7% were disabled. Questions concerning growth rates and many other aspects cannot yet be answered. However, it is apparent that cardiac transplantation in the pediatric population is a very worthwhile endeavor. 
A mathematical computer stimulation model for the development of colonic polyps and colon cancer. Currently known information about the development and progression of colon polyps and cancer is summarized and organized into a mathematical computer simulation model that successfully predicts the natural history of colon polyp and cancer development for an average patient with (1) familial polyposis coli (2) genetic susceptibility as measured by a positive family history, and (3) negative family history with a high fat diet. The mathematical model uses four distinct types of cells (normal, transformed, polypoid, and cancerous) and two kinetic processes (mutation and promotion). Arachidonic acid metabolites play a role in the model in the promotion of cancer from polyps, and account for that promotion through: (1) their effect on encouraging more polypoid cells in mitosis to move toward cancer; and (2) their immunosuppressive effect over time. The model also shows that one defect in allowing more cells to mutate to the transformed state is sufficient to account for the chain of events leading to the clinical sequelae of familial polyposis coli. A second genetic effect at another point in the process is unnecessary. The mechanism of action of Sulindac on colon polyps is explained by the model through inhibition of production of arachidonic acid metabolites, most notably prostaglandin E. 
Antibodies against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes: presence in alcoholic, non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects. Several studies have recently shown the presence of antibodies against acetaldehyde-modifications in the sera of alcoholic patients. To assess the specificity of this immune response, plasma immunoreactivity with proteins modified in vitro by acetaldehyde was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 97 alcoholic patients with varying degrees of alcoholic liver disease, in 35 patients with non-alcoholic liver diseases and in 33 control subjects who were social drinkers. All three groups showed some response against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes. The highest plasma reactivities were found in alcoholics, especially those with steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Plasma from patients with non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects also reacted with the acetaldehyde conjugates, but to a lesser extent than plasma from alcoholics. The reliability of these antibodies as markers of either alcohol abuse or alcoholic liver disease therefore appears to be low. However, further studies using more precisely modified proteins or elucidation of the classes of immunoglobulin involved in the immune response against the modified proteins may give clearer differences between the three groups. 
Activation of cardiac sympathetic afferents during coronary occlusion. Evidence for reflex activation of sympathetic nervous system during transmural myocardial ischemia in the dog. BACKGROUND. Left ventricular sympathetic afferent nerves are located mainly in superficial epicardial layers. Reflex excitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferent nerves have been observed during myocardial ischemia in cats and humans but not in dogs. Previous canine studies have induced ischemia by occlusion of a coronary artery. Extensive collateral circulation in the canine heart may limit ischemia of epicardial layers during simple coronary occlusion, resulting in little stimulation of sympathetic afferent nerves and minimal reflex excitatory responses. METHODS AND RESULTS. In anesthetized dogs with sinoaortic and vagal deafferentation, we determined whether reflex sympathoexcitatory responses mediated by sympathetic afferents occurred during transmural myocardial ischemia. Reflex sympathoexcitation was quantitated by direct recording from either efferent renal (n = 20) or cardiac (n = 5) sympathetic nerves. Responses of arterial pressure and efferent sympathetic nerve activity were measured during simple occlusion of the anterior descending artery (LAD alone) and during LAD occlusion with a circumflex stenosis (LAD + CIRC). This circumflex stenosis was adjusted to abolish coronary vasodilator reserve without reducing basal flow. We observed significantly greater reflex increases in renal (32 +/- 5%) and cardiac (58 +/- 15%) nerve activity during LAD + CIRC than during LAD alone (14 +/- 6% and 8 +/- 7%, respectively). Reflex changes in renal nerve activity during LAD + CIRC were abolished by interruption of cardiac sympathetic afferent pathways (n = 5). In eight experiments, myocardial blood flow was measured during the two coronary occlusions. These experiments confirmed that LAD + CIRC elicited more transmural ischemia in the LAD distribution than did LAD alone. However, these experiments also revealed that LAD + CIRC elicited endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution. In five additional experiments, regional sympathetic deafferentation of the posterior left ventricle by epicardial application of 88% phenol along the atrioventricular groove had no significant effect on renal nerve responses to LAD + CIRC (36 +/- 5% increase before phenol versus 31 +/- 3% increase after phenol). These results indicate that endocardial ischemia in the circumflex distribution did not contribute to the reflex increases in nerve activity that were noted during LAD + CIRC. CONCLUSIONS. Reflex sympathoexcitation mediated by cardiac sympathetic afferents can be elicited in dogs. However, these responses are significant only during ischemia that is transmural and involves the superficial epicardial layers of the left ventricle. 
DNA sequence analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing of the HLA-DQw2 alleles associated with dermatitis herpetiformis. Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a blistering autoimmune skin disease associated with a 95-100% incidence of the HLA class II antigen HLA-DQw2. Although the precise role of this antigen in the pathogenesis of DH is unclear, one theory proposes that patients with DH possess a molecularly unique subtype of the HLA-DQw2 antigen that causes immune abnormalities eventuating in the clinical manifestations of DH. To test this hypothesis, we performed DNA sequence analysis on the highly polymorphic HLA-DQB1 and HLA-DQA1 loci of eight patients with dermatitis herpetiformis. All DQB1 alleles sequenced were identical to the previously described HLA-DQB*0201 allele from HLA-DQw2 normal subjects. In addition, DQA1 alleles sequenced were identical to those alleles previously associated with HLA-DQw2 (DQA*0201, DQA*0501). These data document that although HLA-DQw2 appears to be a necessary element in the pathogenesis of DH, the development of DH is not dependent on the presence of a unique HLA-DQw2 antigen. HLA-DQ allelic typing by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of PCR-amplified HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 fragments was also performed in ten patients with DH to determine the allelic distribution among both HLA-DR3 (eight patients) and non-DR3 (two patients) DH patients. At the HLA-DQ beta chain locus, all patients possessed the DQB1*0201 allele. At the HLA-DQ alpha chain locus, all HLA-DR3 patients and one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0501 allele, whereas one non-DR3 patient displayed a pattern consistent with the DQA1*0201 allele. These data document that patients with DH do not express a unique HLA-DQw2 heterodimer, that the HLA-DQw2 molecules present in patients with DH have no DNA sequence differences from those found in normal HLA-DQw2 subjects and therefore that susceptibility to DH is not due to a unique HLA-DQw2 molecule. 
Gallium-SPECT in the detection of prosthetic valve endocarditis and aortic ring abscess. A 52-yr-old man who had a bioprosthetic aortic valve developed Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Despite antibiotic therapy he had persistent pyrexia and developed new conduction system disturbances. Echocardiography did not demonstrate vegetations on the valve or an abscess, but gallium scintigraphy using SPECT clearly identified a focus of intense activity in the region of the aortic valve. The presence of valvular vegetations and a septal abscess was confirmed at autopsy. Gallium scintigraphy, using SPECT, provided a useful noninvasive method for the demonstration of endocarditis and the associated valve ring abscess. 
The pathophysiology of chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis in the Lewis rat. Electrophysiological studies were performed in Lewis rats with chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced by inoculation with guinea-pig spinal cord and adjuvants and treatment with low dose cyclosporin A. During clinical episodes there was conduction failure in the central nervous system (CNS), namely the spinal cord dorsal columns, and in the afferent fibres in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The following observations indicated that the conduction failure was mainly due to demyelination-induced conduction block: (1) rate-dependent conduction block in the CNS and PNS; (2) temporal dispersion due to slowing of PNS conduction; (3) restoration of PNS conduction by cooling; (4) restoration of CNS conduction by ouabain; (5) previously demonstrated histological evidence of primary demyelination in the dorsal columns, dorsal root ganglia and dorsal roots; and (6) the temporal association of restoration of conduction with remyelination. However, it is likely that CNS and PNS axonal degeneration, which occurs in this disease, also contributed to the conduction failure. In clinical remissions there was restoration of conduction in the CNS and PNS which can be explained by ensheathment/remyelination by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells, respectively. In most rats during clinical episodes the cerebral somatosensory evoked potential was reduced in amplitude and prolonged in latency, which can be accounted for by demyelination and axonal degeneration in the CNS and PNS components of the afferent pathway. In 2 rats with episodes of EAE, however, this potential was markedly increased in amplitude, which might have been due to demyelination-induced conduction block of descending pathways that normally inhibit synaptic transmission in the afferent pathway. In well-established remission there was residual conduction failure in the CNS and PNS which can be mainly accounted for by axonal degeneration. 
Low-dose co-trimoxazole for prevention of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in human immunodeficiency virus disease The efficacy and tolerability of low, intermittent doses of co-trimoxazole (160 mg trimethoprim and 800 mg sulfamethoxazole given Monday, Wednesday, Friday) for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was assessed retrospectively in 116 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex at high risk of PCP. 92% were receiving concomitant zidovudine. 71 with previous episode(s) of PCP were followed a mean of 18.5 months (range 3-42). 45 without past PCP but with depletion of CD4 cells to less than 200/microliters were observed for a mean of 24.2 months (range 9-40). PCP did not develop in any patient on co-trimoxazole. 33 (28%) had side-effects, mainly rash, pruritus, and nausea. 15 discontinued co-trimoxazole, but only 11 (9%), who withdrew in the first month, were clearly drug-intolerant. Thus, low-dose, thrice weekly co-trimoxazole completely prevents AIDS-associated PCP, is cost-effective, and well tolerated by more than 85% of patients. Controlled comparisons of this regimen with other prophylactic agents are warranted. 
Automated pupil perimetry. Pupil field mapping in patients and normal subjects. The authors developed an automated method of pupil perimetry by linking an infrared video pupillometer to a Humphrey Field Analyzer. Software was developed to automatically analyze the pupil responses to focal light stimuli and display the results graphically. All 76 locations of Humphrey program 30-2 could be tested twice within 5.5 minutes and the relative sensitivity of the field was determined by comparing the amplitude of pupil constriction or latency time at each stimulus location. The mean pupil responses within annular areas at 3 degrees, 9 degrees, 15 degrees, 21 degrees, and 27 degrees were shown to be linearly related to log stimulus intensity over a 15 dB range under low level mesopic conditions (3.15 asb bowl background). In normal subjects, the superior temporal quadrant usually had the greatest mean pupillomotor response and the inferior nasal quadrant had the least. Pupil responses in the temporal field were larger than corresponding locations in the nasal field. Patients with visual field defects who underwent testing by pupil perimetry showed pupillary deficits in the same location within the field, providing evidence that pupil perimetry may be a useful, objective means of assessing visual field function. 
Diltiazem-induced psychosis and a possible diltiazem-lithium interaction. Calcium channel blockers are being used increasingly for a variety of cardiovascular problems. Diltiazem hydrochloride, a benzothiazepine derivative, has been reported to have a low incidence of adverse side effects. We report a case of acute psychosis associated with the use of diltiazem in a patient receiving lithium carbonate therapy. Both diltiazem hydrochloride and lithium carbonate have calcium antagonist effects in the central nervous system, and we review their mechanisms of action. A possible synergistic drug interaction between diltiazem and lithium is reported. 
Effects of 30-h sleep loss on cardiorespiratory functions at rest and in exercise. The effects of 30-h sleep deprivation on cardiorespiratory function either at rest or in exercise were studied in 15 young healthy male volunteers. All subjects performed 1-min incremental exercise tests on a bicycle ergometer until exhaustion and endurance exercise tests at 3/4 of their maximal work rates. Arterialized venous blood samples were withdrawn at rest and during exercise tests to investigate the influence of sleep loss on blood gases. In addition, resting plasma catecholamine levels were also measured in ten subjects. The results showed that 1) resting heart rate, plasma catecholamine levels, and blood pH were decreased while minute ventilation (VI) and CO2 production (VCO2) were increased after 30 h of sleep loss (P less than 0.05), and 2) the maximal exercise performance was reduced by sleeplessness, as indicated by the decreases in the maximal heart rate, peak VI, peak VCO2, peak O2 consumption, and time to exhaustion (P less than 0.05). However, no significant changes in exercise endurance, arterialized venous pH, and PCO2 were found in exercise after sleep deprivation either. We therefore conclude that 30-h sleep loss alters cardiorespiratory function at rest and the ability to perform maximal exercise but not exercise endurance. 
Autoantigen recognition by thyroid-infiltrating T cells in Graves disease. Graves disease is a common form of human autoimmune thyroiditis. It shares many pathological features and HLA associations with other, less easily studied, organ-specific autoimmune conditions such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and hence it is also a useful model for understanding these other diseases. We have previously shown that thyroid-infiltrating T cells in Graves disease that have been recently activated in vivo specifically recognize autologous thyroid epithelial cells. However, the autoantigens involved were not defined. In this study, we have made use of antigen-independent T-cell cloning techniques to show that at least three different thyroid antigens, three different epitopes on a single antigen, and two HLA class II elements are involved in this recognition process in a single individual. This demonstrates that T cells that are present and activated at the site of a human autoimmune disease may show considerable heterogeneity in their recognition of autoantigen on the target tissue. This contrasts with the limited heterogeneity recently reported in some animal models and has potentially important implications for both our understanding of the autoimmune process in humans and the design of immunotherapies to reverse it. 
Solitary expression of CD7 among T-cell antigens in acute myeloid leukemia: identification of a group of patients with similar T-cell receptor beta and delta rearrangements and course of disease suggestive of poor prognosis. In a series of 100 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients defined by cytochemistry and immunophenotyping, 20 expressed T-lymphocyte associated antigens on the surface of their blasts. While 15 expressed two or more T-cell antigens, five were found to express only CD7. All patients belonged to the French-American-British type M4, and four were under the age of 40. Despite intensive chemotherapy, four never obtained a complete remission and the fifth died of relapse after an allogenic bone marrow transplantation. While 12 randomly selected T-cell antigen negative AML patients showed only few rearrangements in Ig- or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, such genetic alterations were demonstrated in four of five patients for the TCR delta gene and in all patients for the TCR beta gene. Interestingly, DNA fragments of similar size were demonstrated in three of five patients for both the beta and delta genes. These data suggest that the solitary presence of CD7 among T-cell antigens in otherwise clearcut AML cases identifies a group of patients with similarities in antigen receptor gene configuration as well as outcome. 
Smoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost--United States, 1988. Smoking is a leading cause of diseases associated with premature mortality in the United States; in 1985, these diseases accounted for an estimated 390,000 premature deaths. In this report, mortality data and estimates of smoking prevalence for 1988 are used to calculate smoking-attributable mortality (SAM), years of potential life lost (YPLL), and age-adjusted SAM and YPLL rates for the United States. Calculations were performed using Smoking-Attributable Mortality, Morbidity, and Economic Cost (SAMMEC II) software, which includes relative risk estimates for 22 adult (i.e., greater than or equal to 35 years of age) smoking-related diseases and relative risk estimates for four perinatal (i.e., less than 1 year of age) conditions. Age-, sex-, and race-specific mortality data for 1988 were obtained from CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Data on burn deaths caused by cigarettes were obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The estimated number of deaths among nonsmokers from lung cancer attributable to passive smoking was obtained from a report of the National Academy of Sciences. Age-, sex-, and race-specific current and former smoking prevalence rates in 1988 for adults aged greater than or equal to 35 years and for women aged 18-44 years were estimated by linear extrapolation using National Health Interview Survey data for 1974-1987. 
Tumor necrosis factor receptors in lymphoid tissues and lymphomas. Source and site of action of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), which is produced by germinal center dendritic reticulum cells (DRC) in lymphoid tissue, plays a regulatory role in a local immune response. However no information is available on the nature and location of cells responding to this cytokine. Thus TNF receptor distribution was investigated in situ by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against the p75 and p55 receptor proteins. Receptor expression was unique and restricted to the lymphoreticular tissue. The p75 receptor was found on activated lymphocytes and interdigitating reticulum cells of the T-cell area, whereas the p55 receptor was confined to the germinal center DRCs, which are the main site of TNF alpha production. The two receptor proteins were expressed on distinct cell populations of the lymphoid system and no coexpression was observed. Preliminary results indicate that TNF receptor (TNFR) expression is regulated; Upregulation of TNFR proteins was found in reactive hyperplasia together with increased TNF alpha expression. In lymphoproliferative disorders, expression of the p75 receptor and TNF alpha was found mainly in high-grade malignant non-Hodgkin lymphomas. In summary, TNF alpha produced by germinal center DRCs might regulate an in vivo immune response through autocrine and paracrine pathways. Thus TNF alpha might signal, through the distinct TNFR proteins, the p55 and p75 receptor, which are expressed on different cell types in lymphoid tissue. 
Diagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct: usefulness of lymphangiography and CT. The usefulness of lymphangiography and CT in the diagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct was evaluated in 12 patients with chylothorax or chylous ascites after surgery. Bipedal lymphangiography was performed in all 12 patients. The last four patients studied also had CT after lymphangiography. Seven patients had abnormal findings on lymphangiograms; five with leaks from the thoracic duct, one with a lymphocele in a nephrectomy bed, and one with obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels after thoracotomy. Five patients had no evidence of lymphatic leakage. CT in one patient with evidence of a leak on lymphangiography showed extravasation of contrast medium into the mediastinum and pleural space. CT in three patients with no abnormalities on lymphangiography also showed no abnormalities. Four of the five thoracic duct lacerations and the lymphocele were confirmed surgically. The diagnosis of obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels was supported clinically. Four of the five patients with normal findings on lymphangiograms had resolution of their pleural effusions and no evidence of recurrence during a follow-up period of 1-27 months. One patient with normal findings on lymphangiography had an alternative diagnosis established at surgery. Laceration of the thoracic duct was accurately diagnosed and localized with lymphangiography, which allowed definitive surgical repair. CT was of little additional value in diagnosing these injuries. 
Bilateral diaphragm paralysis after cardiac surgery with topical hypothermia. Bilateral diaphragm paralysis is a rare but important complication of open heart surgery. Two cases were found among 360 prospectively studied patients undergoing open heart surgery during one year. Both patients had insulin dependent diabetes with peripheral neuropathy and this may have contributed to their diaphragm paralysis. The patients were studied postoperatively for one year with measurements of lung function, nocturnal oximetry, diaphragmatic function, and phrenic nerve conduction. Treatment with intermittent positive airway pressure ventilation by nasal mask was effective in both patients. After nine months one patient had recovered completely with normal phrenic nerve conduction and diaphragmatic function; the other continues most of his normal daytime activities, but still requires nasal positive airway pressure ventilation for six hours at night. 
Physiological and anatomical evidence for a magnocellular defect in developmental dyslexia. Several behavioral studies have shown that developmental dyslexics do poorly in tests requiring rapid visual processing. In primates fast, low-contrast visual information is carried by the magnocellular subdivision of the visual pathway, and slow, high-contrast information is carried by the parvocellular division. In this study, we found that dyslexic subjects showed diminished visually evoked potentials to rapid, low-contrast stimuli but normal responses to slow or high-contrast stimuli. The abnormalities in the dyslexic subjects' evoked potentials were consistent with a defect in the magnocellular pathway at the level of visual area 1 or earlier. We then compared the lateral geniculate nuclei from five dyslexic brains to five control brains and found abnormalities in the magnocellular, but not the parvocellular, layers. Studies using auditory and somatosensory tests have shown that dyslexics do poorly in these modalities only when the tests require rapid discriminations. We therefore hypothesize that many cortical systems are similarly divided into a fast and a slow subdivision and that dyslexia specifically affects the fast subdivisions. 
High expression of the DNA methyltransferase gene characterizes human neoplastic cells and progression stages of colon cancer. DNA methylation abnormalities occur consistently in human neoplasia including widespread hypomethylation and more recently recognized local increases in DNA methylation that hold potential for gene inactivation events. To study this imbalance further, we have cloned and localized to chromosome 19 a portion of the human DNA methyltransferase gene that codes for the enzyme catalyzing DNA methylation. Expression of this gene is low in normal human cells, significantly increased (30- to 50-fold by PCR analysis) in virally transformed cells, and strikingly elevated in human cancer cells (several hundredfold). In comparison to colon mucosa from patients without neoplasia, median levels of DNA methyltransferase transcripts are 15-fold increased in histologically normal mucosa from patients with cancers or the benign polyps that can precede cancers, 60-fold increased in the premalignant polyps, and greater than 200-fold increased in the cancers. Thus, increases in DNA methyltransferase gene expression precede development of colonic neoplasia and continue during progression of colonic neoplasms. These increases may play a role in the genetic instability of cancer and mark early events in cell transformation. 
Arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are increased in human colorectal cancer. Increased arachidonic acid concentrations in experimental rodent colonic cancer have been described recently. In humans, a reduced erythrocyte stearic acid to oleic acid ratio has been reported in patients with colorectal cancer and it has been proposed that similar changes exist in the cancer tissue. The long chain fatty acids in the cancers of 15 patients with colorectal cancer were measured and compared with values in the unaffected mucosa. The values were expressed as mean (SD) mg fatty acid/g tissue and compared by analysis of variance. In the cancer tissue arachidonic acid was increased (0.703 (0.109) mg/g v 0.603 (0.127) mg/g, p less than 0.05) as was docosahexaenoic acid (0.211 (0.066) mg/g v 0.148 (0.039) mg/g, p less than 0.001). In contrast, the stearic acid to oleic acid ratio in the cancer tissue was increased rather than decreased, as previously suggested (0.36 (0.05) v 0.29 (0.7), p less than 0.01). Increased arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid concentrations may be related to reduced lipid peroxidation, which is a feature of rapidly growing cells. Alternatively, the increased arachidonic acid values could be due to enhanced desaturase activity upon linoleic and linolenic acid, leading perhaps to increased formation of prostaglandins and other lipoxygenase products. 
bcl-1 rearrangement. Frequency and clinical significance among B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The authors investigated the structural organization of the bcl-1 locus, a putative oncogene associated with reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(11;14), by Southern blot hybridization analysis and its frequency, distribution, and prognostic significance in a panel of 156 clinically and pathologically well-defined B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). The authors detected bcl-1 rearrangements in only 2 of 42 CLLs and 4 of 114 NHLs, specifically 3 of 29 diffuse small lymphocytic and 1 of 10 diffuse small cleaved cell and none of 5 diffuse intermediate lymphocytic, 13 follicular predominantly small cleaved, 17 follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell, 4 diffuse mixed small and large cell, 26 diffuse large cell, and 10 diffuse small noncleaved cell lymphomas. None of seven cases of Rai stage III or IV CLL or seven diffuse large cell lymphomas occurring as Richter's syndrome exhibited bcl-1 rearrangements. In conclusion, the bcl-1 locus rearranges in only about 4% of B-cell CLLs and NHLs, is predominantly rearranged in low-grade B-cell neoplasms, and does not appear to be preferentially associated with those occasional CLLs and low-grade NHLs displaying clinical aggressiveness, advanced clinical stage, or large cell transformation (Richter's syndrome). Therefore the demonstration of bcl-1 rearrangement does not appear to have clinically useful prognostic significance. 
Long-term spinal administration of morphine in cancer and non-cancer pain: a retrospective study. Records of 313 patients who had been treated with spinal morphine via an implanted Port-A-Cath were reviewed. In 284 cases the Port-A-Cath was implanted for epidural delivery of morphine in patients with cancer-related pain. These patients were treated for a mean of 96 (range 1-1215) days. There was a wide variation in dose requirements, minimum daily dose ranging from 0.5 to 200 mg and maximum daily dose from 1 to 3072 mg. However, there was no clear trend to increasing dose as period of epidural morphine administration increased. The most frequent complications were pain on injection (12.0% incidence), occlusion of the portal system (10.9%), infection (8.1%) and leakage of administered morphine such that it did not all reach the epidural space (2.1%). In all but 1 case infections were limited to the area around the portal or along the catheter track. All infections resolved without sequelae following removal of the portal and/or administration of antibiotics. In 17 patients Port-A-Caths were implanted for the intrathecal delivery of morphine to control cancer-related pain. These patients also exhibited wide variations in morphine dose requirements. Port-A-Caths were also implanted for delivery of spinal morphine in 12 patients with chronic pain which was not related to cancer and which failed to respond to other therapies. These patients were treated for a mean of 155 (range 2-575) days. Port-A-Caths were removed from 7 of these patients, primarily due to infection (2 cases) and inadequate pain relief and pain on injection (2 cases). 
Naloxone reverses pattern of obstruction of the distal common bile duct induced by analgesic narcotics in hepatobiliary imaging. It is widely known that narcotics, such as morphine, cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, increasing pressure in the common bile duct. This pharmacologic effect has been applied to hepatobiliary scintigraphy in patients with chronic cholecystitis or cholestasis to reducing the time required for a diagnostic study. However, this feature of narcotics could result in delayed or nonvisualization of the small bowel, simulating a distal common bile duct obstruction, in patients requiring parenteral narcotic analgesics who must undergo hepatobiliary scintigraphy. We report on three patients where administration of intravenous naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan), a narcotic antagonist, was helpful in distinguishing narcotic-induced spasm of the sphincter of Oddi from true obstruction of the common bile duct. 
Intrarectal sonography. A new technique for the assessment of rectal tumors. Preoperative staging of rectal tumors provides a selective therapeutic approach. Twenty-three patients were evaluated with prospective intrarectal sonography. Endosonography identified all 21 rectal lesions. Two patients with previous rectal carcinoma had no evidence of recurrence. Thirteen of 17 patients (76%) with rectal carcinoma were correctly staged by endosonography. A submucosal leiomyosarcoma and pararectal arachnoid cyst were correctly identified. Preoperative assessment of lymph node status was accurate in five of ten patients (50%). Results of preoperative digital rectal examination predicting rectal wall involvement correlated with pathologic findings in 11 of 15 patients (73%). Intrarectal sonography is an important staging technique for preoperative evaluation of rectal wall invasion and guides appropriate surgical intervention. 
Anatomic consideration for sacral screw placement. Instrumentation of the lumbosacral spine increasingly involves screw fixation to the sacrum. Recommended locations and techniques for screw placement vary, particularly when bicortical purchase of the sacrum is performed. The purpose of this study was to describe the critical anatomy and potential injuries to neurovascular and visceral structures anterior to the sacrum. Lack of awareness can lead to life-threatening complications. The study included 22 fresh human cadavers with no prior spinal surgery. Specimens were placed in a prone position, and the lumbosacral spine was exposed. Two 6.5-mm screws were inserted using one of two techniques, respectively: Starting just inferior to the S1 facet one screw was angled 25 degrees caudally and 30 degrees laterally; in the second technique, lateral inclination was increased to 45 degrees. In addition, all specimens had screws placed in the S2 pedicles. An anterior dissection was performed to allow evaluation of the neurovascular and visceral structures at risk for injury by, or adjacent to, the screw tips. All significant neurovascular structures in the area of concern were constant in position. The internal iliac vein and the lumbosacral nerve trunk were most at risk for injury by the 30 and 45 degrees laterally directed screws. The sigmoid colon, though close to the S2 screw, was protected by its mesentery. Screws placed in the S1 pedicle were least likely to injure the neurovascular bundle. A lateral and a midline safe zone were identified. 
Plasma sodium-potassium ATPase inhibition activity in low- and normal-renin hypertension. Thirty-seven subjects with low- and normal-renin hypertension (plasma renin activity less than 0.45 ng/L/sec on a 100 mmol Na diet) were studied on a 10 and 100 mmol sodium diet (100 mmol K and 25 mmol Ca) to examine the effect of varied sodium intake on plasma Na,K-ATPase inhibitory activity (NKAIA) (% inhibition). On the 10 mmol Na diet, plasma NKAIA correlated with mean arterial pressure (MAP) (r = 0.384, P = .019). On the 100 mmol Na diet, plasma NKAIA correlated with daily urinary sodium excretion (r = 0.384, P = .019). With the increase in sodium intake, the mean change in MAP was 0.5 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (range -12.7 to 16.3) and the mean change in plasma NKAIA was -4.2 +/- 11.2% inhibition (range -37.5 to 16). The change in MAP was correlated to the change in plasma NKAIA (r = 0.384, P = .019). Plasma NKAIA is related to mean arterial pressure or urinary sodium excretion depending on the dietary sodium intake, and is related to sodium-induced changes in MAP in low and normal renin hypertensive patients. 
Prevention of stroke by antihypertensive drug treatment in older persons with isolated systolic hypertension. Final results of the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP). SHEP Cooperative Research Group OBJECTIVE.--To assess the ability of antihypertensive drug treatment to reduce the risk of nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke in isolated systolic hypertension. DESIGN.--Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled. SETTING.--Community-based ambulatory population in tertiary care centers. PARTICIPANTS.--4736 persons (1.06%) from 447,921 screenees aged 60 years and above were randomized (2365 to active treatment, 2371 to placebo). Systolic blood pressure ranged from 160 to 219 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure was less than 90 mm Hg. Of the participants, 3161 were not receiving antihypertensive medication at initial contact, and 1575 were. The average systolic blood pressure was 170 mm Hg; average diastolic blood pressure, 77 mm Hg. The mean age was 72 years, 57% were women, and 14% were black. INTERVENTIONS.--Participants were stratified by clinical center and by antihypertensive medication status at initial contact. For step 1 of the trial, dose 1 was chlorthalidone, 12.5 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 25 mg/d. For step 2, dose 1 was atenolol, 25 mg/d, or matching placebo; dose 2 was 50 mg/d. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Primary.--Nonfatal and fatal (total) stroke. Secondary.--Cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause mortality, and quality of life measures. RESULTS.--Average follow-up was 4.5 years. The 5-year average systolic blood pressure was 155 mm Hg for the placebo group and 143 mm Hg for the active treatment group, and the 5-year average diastolic blood pressure was 72 and 68 mm Hg, respectively. The 5-year incidence of total stroke was 5.2 per 100 participants for active treatment and 8.2 per 100 for placebo. The relative risk by proportional hazards regression analysis was 0.64 (P = .0003). For the secondary end point of clinical nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death, the relative risk was 0.73. Major cardiovascular events were reduced (relative risk, 0.68). For deaths from all causes, the relative risk was 0.87. CONCLUSION.--In persons aged 60 years and over with isolated systolic hypertension, antihypertensive stepped-care drug treatment with low-dose chlorthalidone as step 1 medication reduced the incidence of total stroke by 36%, with 5-year absolute benefit of 30 events per 1000 participants. Major cardiovascular events were reduced, with 5-year absolute benefit of 55 events per 1000. 
Ataxic hemiparesis associated with ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome caused by a paracentral gyrus lesion. The authors report a case of ataxic hemiparesis and an ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome in relation to a glioblastoma of the paracentral gyrus region. The physiopathology of this clinical presentation caused by compression of the corticopontine tract is discussed. 
Early angioplasty in patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by hypotension. Emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed in 62 patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by hypotension. All patients were treated within 12 hours of the onset of chest pain. Angioplasty was completely successful (residual lesion less than or equal to 50%) in 48 patients, partially successful (patent vessel greater than 50% residual lesion) in four patients, and unsuccessful in 10 patients. Patients in whom angioplasty was successful had a hospital mortality rate of 19%; those in whom angioplasty was unsuccessful or only partially successful had hospital mortality rates of 60% and 50%, respectively, (p = 0.012). Patients with occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending vessel had the highest failure rate (42%) and the highest mortality rate (67%). Other univariate predictors of hospital mortality were older age and elevated end-diastolic pressure. Successful emergency angioplasty improves mortality in patients with acute infarction complicated by hypotension. 
Protection by 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 and dibutyryl cyclic AMP against complement-mediated hepatic necrosis in rats. 16,16-Dimethyl prostaglandin E2, a known cytoprotective agent, was examined for its ability to protect the liver against complement-mediated necrosis induced by an intravenous injection of a monoclonal antibody against a rat liver-specific antigen in rats. The hepatic injury induced by the antibody was characterized by (a) rapid development of numerous massive hemorrhagic foci of necrotic liver cells, (b) marked increases in serum liver enzyme activities and (c) pronounced reduction in the CH50 level, presumably as a result of complement consumption in the liver. Pretreatment with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 at intraperitoneal doses of 20 and 100 micrograms/kg suppressed the hepatic injury, as evidenced by markedly mitigated liver-cell necrosis and much smaller increases in the serum-enzyme activities compared with the values in diseased control animals. The prostaglandin analogue failed to prevent serum complement consumption in response to the antibody injection or affect the CH50 level at the preinjury stage, indicating that neither complement inactivation nor interference with the antigen-antibody reaction was involved in the hepatic protection. The hepatoprotective doses of 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 produced a significant increase in liver cyclic AMP content in a dose-related manner. In addition, intravenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP at 3 and 10 mg/kg dose-dependently prevented histological and biochemical changes in the hepatic damage without altering the rate of reduction in serum complement activity. Like 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2, dibutyryl cyclic AMP did not affect the preinjury CH50 level. 
Iron chelation therapy and lung transplantation. Effects of deferoxamine on lung preservation in canine single lung transplantation. Reperfusion injury is a limiting factor in lung transplantation. Deferoxamine is an iron chelator that inhibits the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals. We investigated the effects of deferoxamine on posttransplantation lung function in a canine model of single lung transplantation. Twelve dogs underwent left lung transplantation after 20- to 24-hour hypothermic storage in a modified Euro-Collins solution. In six experiments donor and recipient received a 10 mg/kg dose of deferoxamine before harvest and transplantation, and 10 mg/kg was added to the preservation solution. Arterial oxygen tension, alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, pulmonary vascular resistance, and dynamic lung compliance were measured. Data were recorded for 6 hours after ligation of the native pulmonary artery. At the end of the study the mean arterial oxygen tension was 175.1 mm Hg for the deferoxamine treated group versus 71.1 mm Hg for the control group (p less than 0.001), and the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference was less in the deferoxamine-treated group: 502.3 versus 606.0 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The mean pulmonary vascular resistance was lower throughout the study, and after 6 hours it was 455.1 dynes/sec/cm(-5) in the deferoxamine-treated group versus 663.7 dynes/sec/cm(-5) in the control group (p less than 0.035). Compliance was similar in both groups. We conclude that deferoxamine improves lung preservation and early posttransplantation function in canine single lung transplantation. 
Comparative efficacy and safety of bepridil and diltiazem in chronic stable angina pectoris refractory to diltiazem. The Bepridil Collaborative Study Group. The efficacy and safety of bepridil hydrochloride (200 to 400 mg/day) were evaluated in patients with chronic stable angina refractory to maximal tolerated doses of diltiazem (median 360 mg/day) in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, parallel study. Baseline diltiazem data were obtained during a 2-week period, after which 86 patients were randomized to bepridil (n = 46) or diltiazem (n = 40). Angina frequency, nitroglycerin consumption and ischemic manifestations induced by exercise treadmill testing were evaluated over 8 weeks. Bepridil significantly (p less than 0.05) increased time to angina onset, time to 1 and 2 mm of ST-segment depression, total exercise time and total work over baseline values. Changes in time to angina onset and time to 1 mm of ST-segment depression were significantly (p less than 0.05) greater for bepridil than for diltiazem. Angina frequency and nitroglycerin consumption did not differ significantly between groups. Compared with baseline, bepridil significantly (p less than 0.001) decreased heart rate (mean 4 beats/min) and prolonged QTc (mean 35 ms). The most frequent adverse effects in both groups were nausea, asthenia, dizziness, headache and diarrhea. Four patients taking bepridil and 1 taking diltiazem withdrew from the study because of adverse reactions. No sudden deaths, myocardial infarctions or instances of sustained ventricular tachycardia or torsades de pointes occurred in either group. The data indicate that bepridil provided safe and effective antianginal and antiischemic therapy in patients with chronic stable angina who exhibited less than optimal response to maximal tolerated doses of diltiazem. 
Combined vitrectomy, cataract extraction, and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in diabetic patients. Combined extracapsular cataract extraction, pars plana vitrectomy, and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed in six eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. These eyes all had minimal iris vascular changes and were at reasonably low risk for developing intraoperative and postoperative complications. The surgery must be relatively brief and the endophotocoagulation accurate. Initial visual acuities ranged from light perception to 4/200. With an average follow-up of 9.7 months, final acuities ranged from 4/200 to 20/40. 
Inefficacy and proarrhythmic effects of flecainide and encainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of encainide and flecainide in treating patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: Patients were treated with encainide or flecainide. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the results of programmed ventricular stimulation while patients received therapy with the results while they were drug free. SETTING: The electrophysiology laboratory of the University of California at San Francisco. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients with spontaneous or inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation for whom treatment with at least one class IA antiarrhythmic agent had failed. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with encainide, 35 to 50 mg three or four times daily, or flecainide, 100 to 200 mg twice daily. RESULTS: Arrhythmia worsened early in 5 of 16 patients receiving encainide and 3 of 33 patients receiving flecainide. Patients with poor left ventricular function were more likely to exhibit proarrhythmia (P = 0.02). Nine of eleven patients receiving encainide and 23 of 28 patients receiving flecainide who had repeat programmed ventricular stimulation while receiving drug therapy still had inducible, poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: Encainide and flecainide have a low efficacy rate and a high incidence of worsening of arrhythmia in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias, particularly when this condition is associated with poor left ventricular function. 
Serial angiography in a spontaneous dissecting anterior cerebral artery aneurysm. Intracranial dissecting aneurysms are uncommon, and little is known concerning the natural history of these lesions. In this paper we present a rare case of dissecting aneurysm of the anterior cerebral artery in which a true diagnostic sign of "double lumen" was demonstrated. Sequential changes in angiographic features shown on serial angiographic studies are described, and diagnosis is briefly discussed. 
Pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory infections in the developing world: respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are the most frequently isolated pathogens in infants and children with acute lower respiratory infection (LRI) in the developed world. Less information is available about their importance in LRI in the developing world, but they are probably important there also. The pathogenesis of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia involves inoculation and early replication in the upper respiratory tract, followed by aspiration into the lower respiratory tract when both the mucosal and systemic immune systems are involved in a specific response. Both disease and recovery reflect processes of viral replication (with attendant cellular destruction) and of immune response (with attendant direct cellular destruction and release of pathogenic, along with beneficial, mediators). Factors predisposing to bacterial superinfection are poorly understood except in animal models. Conditions leading to heightened susceptibility to severe disease in the developed world are particularly common in the developing world. Increasing information on RSV and PIV infections in the developing world will likely point to their importance. Strategies for prevention of severe illnesses due to these viruses will follow from concepts elucidated through animal models and studies of infants in the developed world. 
Magnetic resonance imaging in the staging of renal cell carcinoma. A prospective study has been carried out to examine the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the investigation of renal cell carcinoma in 24 patients. In all cases the inferior vena cava (IVC) was well demonstrated with MRI. In 14 out of 15 patients where surgical correlation was available, the MRI and operative staging were in agreement. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic (CT) staging were in agreement in 16 out of the 17 patients where both were performed. In one case, CT suggested hepatic invasion but this was found not to be present on MRI and at operation. Magnetic resonance imaging also provided substantial additional information in three patients, including two cases where MRI demonstrated a patent IVC that appeared occluded on CT (one of which also had vertebral metastases seen on MRI but missed on CT) and one case where CT failed to demonstrate minimal involvement of the IVC. Magnetic resonance imaging is an accurate means of staging renal cell carcinoma with clear advantages over CT. In no case in this series was inferior vena cavography found to be necessary. 
Monitoring of irrigating fluid absorption during transurethral prostatectomy. A study in anaesthetised patients using a 1% ethanol tag solution. A simple, reliable method to detect absorption of irrigating fluid during transurethral prostatectomy is to tag irrigating fluids with 1% ethanol and monitor expired breath ethanol concentrations. This method correlated well (n = 0.79) with other existing methods of absorption monitoring in 20 anaesthetised patients. Ethanol (1%) tagging does not alter the optical quality of the irrigating fluid and is harmless to the patient. The technique is non-invasive, repeatable, cheap and gives instant results. It can be used in anaesthetised or awake patients and can detect absorption of as little as 100-150 ml in any 10-minute period. 
Cholelithiasis after treatment for childhood cancer. The authors evaluated the risk of development of cholelithiasis in 6050 patients treated at a single hospital for various childhood cancers with different therapeutic modalities, including chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation, from 1963 to 1989. Patients with underlying chronic hemolytic anemia or preexisting gallstones were excluded. Nine female and seven male patients with a median age of 12.4 years (range, 1.2 to 22.8 years) at diagnosis of primary cancer had gallstones develop 3 months to 17.3 years (median, 3.1 years) after therapy was initiated. Cumulative risks of 0.42% at 10 years and 1.03% at 18 years after diagnosis substantially exceed those reported for the general population of this age group. Treatment-related factors significantly associated with an increased risk of cholelithiasis were ileal conduit, parenteral nutrition, abdominal surgery, and abdominal radiation therapy (relative risks and 95% confidence intervals = 61.6 [27.9-135.9], 23.0 [9.8-54.1], 15.1 [7.1-32.2], and 7.4 [3.2-17.0], respectively). There was no correlation with the type of cancer, nor was the frequency of conventional predisposing features (e.g., family history, obesity, use of oral contraceptives, and pregnancy) any higher among the affected patients in this study than in the general population. Patients with cancer who have risk factors identified here should be monitored for the development of gallstones. 
Long-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction. To assess the long-term effect of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular (LV) systolic function, 222 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator within 4 hours of symptom onset underwent assessment of LV ejection fraction (EF) by radionuclide equilibrium angiography at hospital discharge and 1 year later. Mean EF at hospital discharge (46 +/- 12) was similar to that at 1 year (45 +/- 13). Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis identified EF at discharge and patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge as independent predictors of EF change at 1 year (p = 0.0002 and 0.003, respectively). Random assignments to invasive versus conservative treatment strategies or to early versus delayed beta-blocker therapy did not affect EF change during follow-up. No significant deterioration of EF was observed in patients with larger infarcts. However, EF decreased from 45 +/- 10 at hospital discharge to 39 +/- 12 (p = 0.005) at 1-year follow-up in a subgroup of patients with history of prior infarction. Thus, patients with acute myocardial infarction, treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator early after onset of symptoms, appear to have stable LV function between hospital discharge and 1 year follow-up. The change in EF between hospital discharge and 1 year can be predicted from the EF value at discharge, patency of the infarct-related artery before discharge and history of previous myocardial infarction. 
Effect of insulin and plasma amino acid concentration on leucine metabolism in cirrhosis. Clinically stable patients with cirrhosis demonstrate insulin resistance with regard to glucose metabolism. However, much less is known about the two major factors, insulin and plasma amino acid concentration, that regulate protein metabolism in cirrhotic patients. To examine this question, we performed paired euglycemic insulin clamp studies in combination with 14C-leucine and indirect calorimetry. In the first study insulin alone was infused, and the plasma amino acid concentration was allowed to decline. During the second study a balanced amino acid solution was infused with insulin to increase the total plasma amino acid concentration approximately twofold. Insulin-mediated glucose disposal (4.68 vs. 6.45 mg/kg-min, p less than 0.01) was significantly impaired by 30% in cirrhotic patients during both insulin clamp studies. In the postabsorptive state, cirrhotic patients manifested low plasma leucine (76 vs. 102 mumol/L) and alpha-ketoisocaproate (19 vs. 30 mumol/L) concentrations, but all parameters of leucine turnover were normal. When insulin alone was infused, the endogenous leucine flux (an index of protein degradation) declined similarly in cirrhotic patients (30.8 mumol/m2-min) and control (26.9) subjects, and this was accompanied by a similar decrease in plasma leucine concentration (31% vs. 33%). The decline in circulating leucine concentration was accompanied by a parallel decline in leucine oxidation (5.1 vs. 4.6 mumol/m2-min) and nonoxidative (28.9 vs. 26.0 mumol/m2-min) leucine disposal, which were of similar magnitude in cirrhotic patients and control subjects, respectively. In both cirrhotic patients and control subjects, combined hyperinsulinemia/hyperaminoacidemia elicited a similar stimulation of nonoxidative leucine disposal (an index of protein synthesis) and leucine oxidation while causing a greater suppression of endogenous leucine flux than observed with insulin alone. Thus the suppressive effect of insulin on protein degradation and the stimulatory effect of insulin/amino acid infusion on protein synthesis are not impaired in cirrhotic patients, demonstrating a clear-cut dissociation between the effects of insulin on protein and glucose metabolism. 
Novel approach to iatrogenic bile peritonitis. Bile peritonitis after injury to the biliary tree is a serious complication that requires exploratory laparotomy. Our patient had an obstructing ampullary carcinoma, and generalized bile peritonitis developed from attempted percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. The patient's condition was managed by peritoneal lavage and endoscopic transampullary stenting, with immediate relief of pain and toxicity. Exploratory laparotomy was avoided, and an eventual pylorus-sparing Whipple resection was the definitive treatment. We believe this to be the first report of successful nonoperative treatment of a patient with bile peritonitis with obstructive jaundice. 
Comparative efficacy of cimetidine, famotidine, ranitidine, and mylanta in postoperative stress ulcers. Gastric pH control and ulcer prevention in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery. To determine the comparative efficacy of several histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists (cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine) and the antacid Mylanta-II (Stuart Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE) in gastric pH control and the prevention of postoperative stress ulceration, a prospective, randomized study was performed in a homogeneous population of patients with elective coronary artery bypass. None of the 57 patients in the study population had a documented history of ulcer disease. There were four treatment groups, each with similar demographics (age and sex). Cimetidine-treated group consisted of 15, famotidine-treated group of 18, ranitidine-treated group of 19, and antacid-treated group of 5 patients. There was no hemodynamically significant postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding in any of the patients. When the agents were compared for efficacy of gastric pH control, statistically better pH control was found in the famotidine- and ranitidine-treated groups (P less than 0.003) than in the cimetidine-treated group (pH less than or equal to 4.0) during the 20-hour observation period. Side effects (hematologic and neurological) were noted only in the cimetidine-treated group. The results of this study indicate that in patients in postoperative intensive care, better gastric pH control, and thus prevention of gastric stress ulcers, is achieved with either famotidine or ranitidine rather than cimetidine or antacid. 
Abnormal permeability precedes the development of a gluten sensitive enteropathy in Irish setter dogs. Intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA was examined during the development of gluten sensitive enteropathy in dogs bred from affected Irish setters and reared on a normal wheat containing diet. Comparisons were made with litter mates reared on a gluten free diet and with a control group of age matched, clinically healthy Irish setters reared on the normal diet. Studies at 4, 6, 8, and 12 months of age were correlated with morphometric and biochemical examinations of peroral jejunal biopsy specimens. Permeability was increased at all ages in the group fed gluten free diet compared with control dogs, although there were no differences in villus height, intraepithelial lymphocyte density, and alkaline phosphatase activity. At four months, permeability in the normal diet group was greater than in controls, although comparable with that in the gluten free diet group. Permeability in the normal diet group increased further in conjunction with the development of partial villus atrophy and reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, and by 12 months permeability was significantly greater than in their gluten free diet litter mates and the control dogs. The findings suggest that an underlying permeability abnormality may be involved in the pathogenesis of gluten sensitive enteropathy in Irish setter dogs. 
Acute inflammation: the underlying mechanism in delayed onset muscle soreness? It is well documented in animal and human research that unaccustomed eccentric muscle action of sufficient intensity and/or duration causes disruption of connective and/or contractile tissue. In humans, this appears to be associated with the sensation of delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). During the late 1970's, it was proposed that this sensation of soreness might be associated with the acute inflammatory response. However, subsequent research failed to substantiate this theory. The present article suggests that the results of much of the research concerning DOMS reflect events typically seen in acute inflammation. Similarities between the two events include: the cardinal symptoms of pain, swelling, and loss of function; evidence of cellular infiltrates, especially the macrophage; biochemical markers such as increased lysosomal activity and increased circulating levels of some of the acute phase proteins; and histological changes during the initial 72 h. In the final section of this paper, a theoretical sequence of events is proposed, based on research involving acute inflammation and DOMS. 
alpha Fetoprotein producing early gastric cancer with liver metastasis: report of three cases. Three cases of alpha fetoprotein producing early gastric cancer are presented. Liver metastases occurred in all patients shortly after curative gastrectomy and all died within two years. The incidence of liver metastasis was significantly higher than that in alpha fetoprotein negative early gastric carcinoma (p less than 0.001). The incidences of lymph node metastasis and invasion in lymph vessels and veins were also substantially higher in this group of patients. Two radical hepatic resections, including extended right lobectomy, were performed on one patient but the tumour recurred immediately. 
Abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling in eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy of obesity. Left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling pattern of obese subjects with eccentric LV hypertrophy was studied. Findings were compared with those of normal control subjects and hypertensive patients with concentric LV hypertrophy. M-mode, 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiograms were recorded in 11 obese (body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2) normotensive patients with eccentric LV hypertrophy, 10 normal control subjects, and 18 nonobese, hypertensive patients with concentric LV hypertrophy whose antihypertensive medications were discontinued 2 weeks before study. LV hypertrophy was defined as LV mass/height greater than 143 g/m. Hypertrophy in the obese patients was eccentric: Their LV internal dimension (61 +/- 3 mm) was greater than that of hypertensive patients (55 +/- 5 mm, p less than 0.001) and normal control subjects (55 +/- 2 mm, p less than 0.01); their septal (10.7 +/- 0.7 mm) and posterior (10.9 +/- 0.6 mm) wall thicknesses were smaller than those of the hypertensive patients (12.2 +/- 1.7 mm, p less than 0.05 and 11.7 +/- 1.2 mm, respectively, difference not significant). Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiographic filling indexes were used to evaluate LV diastolic filling. Obese patients had a higher peak velocity of atrial filling (69 +/- 14 vs 54 +/- 15 cm/s, p less than 0.05), lower early/atrial filling velocity ratio (1.0 +/- 0.26 vs 1.32 +/- 0.21, p less than 0.05), prolonged deceleration half-time (108 +/- 9 vs 86 +/- 15 ms, p less than 0.01) and lower peak filling rate corrected to stroke volume (4.08 +/- 0.68 vs 4.96 +/- 0.88 stroke volume/s, p less than 0.05) than normal control subjects. 
Coexistent hemangioblastoma and arteriovenous malformation of the cerebellum. Case report. A case of cerebellar hemangioblastoma and coexistent arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is presented. Angiography displayed the AVM, but histological examination revealed a coexisting hemangioblastoma. Various theories concerning the etiology of this condition are discussed. 
Branched-chain-enriched amino acid solutions in patients with liver failure: an early example of nutritional pharmacology. The use of BCAA in the treatment of hepatic failure has been controversial. Even in retrospect, it is difficult to know why this controversy existed and why it has been so emotional, except for the fact that such a treatment modality has flown in the face of conventional therapy of hepatic encephalopathy, and also, probably more importantly, directly attacked some of the cherished notions of the nature of hepatic encephalopathy. Time and distance have allowed some of the controversy to die down, and as time has elapsed it has become clear that at least in the area of nutritional support of patients with hepatic failure, BCAA are the preferred alternative to treat patients who are otherwise protein intolerant. A recent unbiased review using the techniques of meta-analysis has concluded that the BCAA are efficacious for the treatment of patients with hepatic encephalopathy. Since this manuscript was completed another study has been reported. In this study, it was notable that those patients treated with oral BCAA became neurologically normal, a finding which the authors found very striking. 
Effect of epidural clonidine on analgesia and pharmacokinetics of epidural fentanyl in postoperative patients. Epidural clonidine produces postoperative analgesia in patients and potentiates opioid analgesia in animals. The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of epidural clonidine on the plasma concentrations and analgesic effect of fentanyl after epidural administration. Twenty ASA physical status 2 or 3 patients recovering from abdominal surgery were allocated randomly to receive either epidural fentanyl (100 micrograms in 10 ml isotonic saline; EF group) or epidural fentanyl (same dose) plus epidural clonidine (150 micrograms; EF + C group) in isotonic saline solution. Analgesia was assessed over a period of 12 h after epidural injection. Venous samples were obtained until 360 min after epidural injection for radioimmunoassay determination of plasma fentanyl concentration. Onset of analgesia was similar in the two groups of patients (13 +/- 6 and 13 +/- 3 min, respectively, after injection), but duration was more than doubled in the patients receiving clonidine (543 +/- 183 vs. 250 +/- 64 min). Peak plasma fentanyl concentrations (Fmax) and the time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were comparable in the two groups (0.29 +/- 0.15 ng.ml-1 at 16.2 +/- 14.8 min in the EF group and 0.27 +/- 0.11 ng.ml-1 at 8.3 +/- 5.5 min in the EF + C group), as were plasma concentrations at each definite time of measurement. Drowsiness and hypotension were noticed in the EF + C group. Thus, epidural clonidine appears to prolong epidural fentanyl analgesia without affecting its plasma concentration. 
Tissue-specific activation of cardiac angiotensin converting enzyme in experimental heart failure. In addition to the circulating renin-angiotensin system, recent data demonstrate the existence of tissue renin-angiotensin systems that may be important in cardiovascular homeostasis. However, the relative activities of the circulating and tissue renin-angiotensin systems have not been examined previously in pathophysiological states, such as congestive heart failure. The present study was performed to examine the status of plasma and tissue angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activities in compensated experimental heart failure induced by coronary artery ligation in the rat. Three groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats were examined: 1) nonoperated rats (NO, n = 5), 2) sham-operated rats (SO, n = 5), and 3) heart failure rats (HF, n = 11). Rats were studied an averaged of 85 days postoperatively. In HF animals, plasma renin concentration and serum ACE activities were not different compared with NO and SO control animals. Cardiac ACE activity was 50% greater in the right ventricle than the interventricular septum in NO and SO rats. Both right ventricular and interventricular septal ACE activity increased approximately twofold in HF animals as compared with NO and SO groups (p less than 0.05). In contrast, pulmonary, aortic, and renal ACE activities were not altered in HF rats compared with control animals. A positive correlation existed between the histopathological size of myocardial infarction and the level of right ventricular ACE activity (r = 0.75, p less than or equal to 0.05). Such a relation between infarct size and either serum or noncardiac tissue ACE activities was not observed. 
Safety and possible efficacy of fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage in the management of refractory asthma with mucous impaction. Mucous impaction may be suspected in asthmatic exacerbation when, despite aggressive medical management, patients continue to produce sputum containing mucous plugs and exhibit prominent rhonchi and/or wheezes on chest auscultation. Spirometric measurements in this setting corroborate lack of improvement and reveal significant impairment in indices that may reflect small airways function (FEF25-75). We hypothesized that clearance of inspissated secretions by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with lavage (FOBwL) may promote or hasten the clinical improvement of such patients. Fifty-one therapeutic FOBwL were accomplished in 19 patients during 20 episodes of stabilized yet refractory asthma with mucous impaction. No significant complications were encountered. After FOBwL, spirometric measurements of FEV1, FEF25-75, and FVC increased significantly (P less than .01, paired t test), and correlated with relief of dyspnea and mobilization of secretions with cough. FOBwL can be safely performed in stabilized, refractory asthma, and with apparent efficacy. Further investigation is needed to document the therapeutic utility of FOBwL in refractory asthma. 
Ultrasonic evaluation of gallbladder function prior to non-surgical treatment of gallstones. A comparative analysis of ultrasonic and oral cholecystographic assessment of gallbladder function in symptomatic patients with cholelithiasis is presented. Ultrasonic evaluation demonstrated non-contractile gallbladders in all but one patient with non-opacification during oral cholecystography, whereas all those opacifying on oral cholecystography contracted on ultrasonography. Both techniques showed similar abilities to quantify the size and number of biliary calculi within the limits necessary to determine suitability for treatment. Although computed tomography remains necessary to quantify gallstone density prior to non-surgical treatment, ultrasonography is a safe, acceptable, cheap and preferable alternative to oral cholecystography in assessing gallbladder function. 
Emergence of a B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma in a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia: evidence for the single-cell origin of the two tumors. A patient is described who presented with a chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and later developed a lymphoblastic lymphoma. The cells from the CLL were typical mature B lymphocytes as could be assessed by morphologic, cytochemical, and surface marker analyses. The cells from the lymphoblastic lymphoma were immature B cells that expressed CD10, CD20, and HLA-DR markers, but not surface Ig or cytoplasmic mu chains, and were negative for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). The cells of two continuous cell lines, obtained from the bone marrow and the peripheral blood of the patient, had the same phenotype as the lymphoblastic lymphoma cells, did not contain the Epstein-Barr virus genome, and displayed malignant features in vitro, including the capacity to form colonies in agar. The two cell lines also shared identical chromosomal abnormalities, a finding which suggests that they derived from the same malignant cell already present in vivo. Such chromosomal abnormalities were not seen in the karyotype of the peripheral blood cells at the onset of the disease. Analysis of the Ig heavy chain genes using a DJ-specific probe showed the very same monoclonal rearrangement in the cells from the B-CLL, the lymphoblastic lymphoma and the two cell lines, thus demonstrating their common clonal origin. By contrast, a monoclonal rearrangement of the lambda chain gene locus was found in the B-CLL cells only, a finding consistent with their exclusive capacity to express surface IgM lambda. This patient represents a rare case in whom a chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with mature malignant cells transforms into a lymphoblastic lymphoma characterized by cells frozen at a very early maturational stage. The possible mechanisms leading to such transformation within the same cell clone are discussed. 
Wildervanck or cervico-oculo-acoustic syndrome and MRI findings. In 1952, Wildervanck described the first case of what he styled the cervico-oculo-acoustic (COA) syndrome. This comprises Klippel Feil's (KF) anomaly (congenitally fused cervical vertebrae), congenital sensorineural deafness and Duane's retraction syndrome (deficient abduction with retraction on adduction). Since that original paper, there have been further reports describing this triad, either completely or incompletely. A further case of this syndrome is reported and the first report of MRI head scan findings in this condition is presented. In addition, the origin of mirror movements observed as part of the KF syndrome are discussed. 
Hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection mimicking metastatic cancer to the liver. A cholestatic syndrome caused by sclerosing cholangitis and papillary stenosis has been described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection. The case of a 41-year-old homosexual man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and cholestasis is reported. A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram showed that the extrahepatic and right-sided intrahepatic ducts were normal. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver. Guided needle biopsies of several of these lesions showed severe confluent necrotizing pericholangitis with cytomegalovirus-infected cells. Numerous cryptosporidia were seen attached to biliary epithelium. The unique histopathologic and radiographic features of this case should be added to the spectrum of hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. 
Multiple miliary osteoma cutis. We describe the clinical, radiographic, histologic, and metabolic features of an unusual case of multiple miliary osteoma cutis in an otherwise healthy 57-year-old woman. Although the pathogenesis of this rarely reported entity is not fully understood, the novel application of a dynamic bone study revealed a high rate of internal bone remodeling within the lesion. This finding prompted a brief therapeutic trial of a diphosphonate, not previously reported in the treatment of this condition. 
A prospective study of respiratory failure after high-risk surgery on the thoracoabdominal aorta. From June 1960 to September 1990, 1414 patients underwent repair of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, of whom 112 (8%) had pulmonary complications requiring respiratory support with tracheostomy; subsequently 45 (40%) died in the hospital. We determined by stepwise logistic regression analysis, in a prospective study of high-risk type I and II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms repairs, the independent predictors of respiratory failure, defined as respiratory ventilation exceeding 48 hours after operation. In 98 patients studied, 38 (39%) were women, 60 (61%) were men, 54 (55%) had type II thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 34 (35%) had aortic dissection, 19 (19%) were nonsmokers, 40 (41%) exsmokers, and 39 (40%) active smokers. Before operation, 55 (56%) had chronic pulmonary disease with respiratory failure developing in 58% (p = 0.0005 versus no chronic pulmonary disease, 10/43, 23%), and of the 26 patients in the lower quarter of forced expiratory volume (1 sec) (FEV1 less than or equal to 1.45 L) respiratory failure developed in 61% (p = 0.035). In-hospital survival was 98% and 83% (p = 0.008), respectively, and cumulative survival at 6 months by Kaplan-Meier analysis was 96% and 80% (p = 0.004, log-rank test), respectively, for patients without respiratory failure (N = 56/98, 57%) and with respiratory failure (N = 42/98, 43%). On univariate analysis, the following were associated with respiratory failure (p less than 0.05): FEV1, FEV1% predicted, FVC, FEF25, FEF25% predicted, FEF25-75, FEF25-75% predicted, PaCO2 Pao2, symptoms, smoking history, chronic pulmonary disease, cryoprecipitate volume, postoperative neuromuscular deficit, cardiac complications, reoperation for bleeding, renal complication, stress ulceration, postoperative creatinine level, postoperative dialysis, and postoperative encephalopathy. The independent predictors of respiratory failure were (p less than 0.05): chronic pulmonary disease, smoking history, cardiac and renal complications. In patients with chronic pulmonary disease, the only independent predictor was FEF25 (p = 0.030). These observations may be of value in selecting patients for elective operation. 
Preventive therapy for malaria. The incidence of malaria in travelers returning to the United States has been increasing. Persons visiting areas where malaria is endemic should use insect repellent, wear clothing that covers the arms and legs, and remain in screened areas between dusk and dawn. Chemoprophylaxis for travelers consists of weekly doses of chloroquine; a new drug, mefloquine, should be used in the increasing number of countries where chloroquine-resistant malaria is found. Travelers to these areas should carry three tablets of pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine, which should be taken for presumptive treatment of malaria at the onset of chills and fever. It is essential that chemoprophylaxis be continued for four to five weeks after departure from endemic areas. In travelers who develop symptoms of malaria after returning from an endemic area, it is imperative that treatment be started even if blood smears are negative. 
Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander syndrome: serum creatine kinase and functional outcome. The medical records of 31 patients (19 male and 12 female) with clinical and electrophysiologic features of Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander syndrome were reviewed. The reported age at onset ranged from less than one year to 46 years, and the age at diagnosis ranged from three to 66 years. Proximal muscle weakness, especially of the lower extremities, and muscular atrophy were the predominant clinical features. Elevated serum creatine kinase levels were noted in four female and 12 male patients, and the degree of elevation was higher in the male patients (up to 32 times the upper limit of normal) than in the female patients. On initial evaluation, two patients were wheelchair-bound, whereas the others were ambulatory. On follow-up evaluation three to 32 years later (mean, 15.5 years), 11 patients used wheelchairs, although only three were wheelchair-bound. The disease followed a steady, slowly progressive course. The outcome of ambulatory status did not correlate with the initial creatine kinase determination. 
Characterization of fibronectin attachment by a human transitional cell carcinoma line, T24. The ability of transitional cell carcinoma cells to adhere to and invade the extracellular matrix is important in invasion and metastasis. The glycoprotein fibronectin is associated with laminin and Type IV collagen in the bladder basement membrane. We characterized the interaction between T-24 cells, a cell line derived from an invasive transitional cell tumor, and fibronectin. The cells use the alpha 5 beta 1 heterodimeric integrin receptor complex to mediate adherence via the classical (RGDS) fibronectin binding site. The importance of the alpha 5 beta 1 receptor to T-24 function is unknown and under investigation. 
Human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 in adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. Many reports have shown a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical squamous neoplasia. However, the association of HPV with cervical adenocarcinoma has been studied less extensively. The authors evaluated the presence of HPV-DNA in 106 patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix by in situ hybridization, using 35S-labeled probes for HPV 16 DNA and HPV 18 DNA. The overall prevalence of HPV-DNA was 18% (19 of 106). HPV 16 was present in 2 (2%) cases, HPV 18 was observed in 15 (14%) cases, and both HPV 16 and HPV 18 were found in 2 (2%) cases. There was a correlation between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor stage (P less than 0.01) and tumor size (P less than 0.05), but there was no relationship between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor differentiation, proliferation (S-phase fraction), ploidy, lymph node metastases, or five-year survival rate. These results suggest that HPV 18 DNA is associated with cervical adenocarcinoma but the presence of HPV 18 has no influence on overall survival. 
Acute health effects in a community after a release of hydrofluoric acid. Approximately 3,000 persons were evacuated from a Texas community after 24,036 kg (53,000 lb) of caustic hydrofluoric acid (HF) were released from a nearby petrochemical plant. Emergency room and hospital records of 939 persons who were seen at two area hospitals were reviewed. Most persons who presented at the emergency rooms were female (56%) or black (60%), and their mean age was 33.9 y. The most frequently reported symptoms were eye irritation (41.5%), burning throat (21%), headache (20.6%), and shortness of breath (19.4%). Physical examination results were normal for 49% of the cases; however, irritation of the eyes, nose, throat, skin, and lungs were noted on other exams. Decreased pulmonary function was demonstrated by pulmonary function tests (forced expiratory volume in the first second, less than 80% of predicted value, 42.3%); hypoxemia (pO2 less than 80 mm Hg, 17.4%) and hypocalcemia (less than 8.5 mg/dl, 16.3%) were also noted. Ninety-four (10%) of the cases were hospitalized, and more than 83% of all cases were discharged with a primary diagnosis of "HF exposure." There are several reports of individuals who are acutely and chronically exposed to HF; however, we are unaware of other published reports that describe exposure of a community to HF. This incident represented a unique opportunity to study the immediate health impact on a community of residents who were exposed to a hazardous materials release. Results of this analysis suggest that (a) initial health problems should be followed up, (b) any long-term health effects of HF exposure must be assessed, and (c) the health impact on the population at risk should be determined. 
Nocturnal sleep in Huntington's disease. Nocturnal sleep was studied in 16 inpatients with Huntington's disease. In comparison with healthy controls, patients exhibited a disturbed sleep pattern with increased sleep onset latency, reduced sleep efficiency, frequent nocturnal awakenings, more time spent awake and less slow wave sleep. These abnormalities correlated in part with duration of illness, severity of clinical symptoms, and degree of atrophy of the caudate nucleus. Patients showed an increased density of sleep spindles. 
Persistent diarrhea and fecal shedding of retroviral nucleic acids in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Gastrointestinal dysfunction is a serious problem in many children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the etiology of which has not been clearly defined. Quantitative nucleic acid amplification was used to study the correlation between shedding of HIV nucleic acids and gastrointestinal symptoms in HIV-infected infants and children. Many with HIV infection and persistent diarrheal disease shed HIV nucleic acids in their feces, as did an HIV-infected patient without apparent diarrheal disease. HIV nucleic acids were not found in feces of non-HIV-infected individuals. Intestinal infection with HIV appears to be important in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal dysfunction in infants and children with HIV infection. Furthermore, the fecal shedding of HIV may play a role in HIV transmission in environments prone to high levels of fecal-oral contamination. 
Early orthopedic intervention in burn patients with major fractures. Surgical treatment of concurrent orthopedic trauma in burn patients is controversial. During a 10-year period, 101 patients were treated for major fractures and burn injuries. Twenty-eight patients with 34 fractures were treated with early operative fixation. The mean TBSA burned was 20%. Ten fractures were open (4 grade I, 5 grade II, and 1 grade III) and 24 were closed. Seventy-five percent of patients had a definitive orthopedic procedure within 24 hours of burn. Intramedullary nails were used in 13, ORIF in 15, external fixation in 3, and percutaneous fixation in 4. Ten patients had burns overlying the fracture site and the surgical incision was made through burned tissue. Four were associated with open fractures. Two orthopedic complications occurred: nonunion of a femoral neck fracture and angulation of a tibial plateau fracture. The goal of orthopedic management in the polytrauma burn patient is to achieve early reduction to allow optimal wound care and early patient mobility. A team approach to patient selection and management is mandatory. 
Deletion of mitochondrial DNA in patients with combined features of Kearns-Sayre and MELAS syndromes. A 9-year-old girl and an 11-year-old boy had ptosis, progressive external ophthalmoplegia, pigmentary retinopathy, and sensorineural hearing loss. The girl had diabetes mellitus and the boy had hypoparathyroidism. Both children also developed recurrent vomiting and cerebral infarcts with lactic acidosis. Muscle biopsy specimens showed ragged-red fibers and Southern analysis demonstrated a distinct heteroplasmic deletion of muscle mitochondrial DNA in each patient but no evidence of the point mutation in the transfer RNALeu(UUR) gene recently identified in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). These 2 children had combined features of Kearns-Sayre syndrome and MELAS, suggesting that mitochondrial DNA deletions occasionally can have pleomorphic clinical expression. 
Verbal dyspraxia in treated galactosemia. Galactosemia is an inborn error of metabolism that causes life-threatening illness a few days after galactose-containing milk is fed to a newborn. Early treatment with a strict lactose-free diet results in rapid improvement, and, until recently, it was thought that the long-term prognosis in such infants was usually good. The speech characteristics of 24 patients treated for galactosemia were examined. Fifty-four percent had the specific speech disorder, verbal dyspraxia. This finding was not related to age at diagnosis, severity of symptoms in the newborn period, or to biochemical control. There may be, however, a relation between dyspraxia and diminished IQ scores observed in the group of patients with dyspraxia judged as "severe." The findings indicate the association of a specific and unusual speech defect with a specific and rare metabolic disorder. 
Endoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology in the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal and colorectal malignancies. In a prospective study we compared the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic fine needle aspiration cytology with that of brush cytology and forceps biopsy in relation to gross tumour pattern and site in 265 confirmed consecutive cases of malignancy of the oesophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum. Aspiration cytology gave the highest diagnostic accuracy (94%), which was significantly better than that of brush cytology (84.9%) and biopsy (87.2%) (p less than 0.005). The difference was mainly related to tumour pattern. When compared to brush cytology and biopsy aspiration cytology was significantly better in submucosal tumours (92.9% v 7.1% and 14.3%, p less than 0.001); in infiltrative malignancies (95.8% v 90.1% and 78.9%, p less than 0.01), and in ulceronecrotic malignancies (90.9% v 36.4% and 45.4%, p less than 0.05). In polypoid malignancies there was a significant trend (p less than 0.05) in favour of forceps biopsy, with a diagnostic yield of 100% compared with 95% for aspiration cytology and 93.3% for brush cytology. The accuracy of the different techniques was not significantly related to the site of the tumour. The cumulative accuracy of aspiration cytology and biopsy was significantly better than that of biopsy and brush cytology (98.5% v 90.9%, p less than 0.005). Aspiration cytology was diagnostic in 21 of 24 lesions that were negative with both brush cytology and biopsy. There were no false positive cytology or histology results. We conclude that aspiration cytology is a simple, safe, and reliable technique with a high diagnostic yield and is of particular value in submucosal, infiltrative, and ulceronecrotic tumours. 
Variation in intravaginal pressure measurements. The wide variation in intravaginal pressure measurements of the circumvaginal muscles (CVM) was studied in five subjects under well-controlled conditions. Previous research and clinical observations have indicated that fluctuations in the measurement of intravaginal pressure may be associated with time of day, day of testing, and existing stress factors. Subjects were assessed four times per day, on four consecutive days, for a total of 16 assessments. At each of the 16 conditions for a given subject, 10 CVM contractions lasting 12 seconds each were recorded and the variables, maximum pressure (MP10), peak maximum pressure (PMP), and abdominal pressure were analyzed. The within-subject variance was 15.5 (SD = 3.9); the between-subject variance was 132.4 (SD = 11.5). The effects of day, time, and stressor were analyzed by ANOVA specifically designed for variance estimates; no significant differences were found. The clinical observations that led to the study were not supported when systematically investigated. However, consistent data collection procedures appeared to reduce within-subject variance. 
Partial lamellar sclerouvectomy for ciliary body and choroidal tumors. The authors reviewed the postoperative course, visual results, histopathologic findings, and mortality data on 95 consecutive patients with tumors of the ciliary body and/or choroid who were managed by a partial lamellar sclerouvectomy. This surgical procedure is designed to remove the uveal tumor and leave intact the outer sclera and sensory retina. In this group of 95 patients, vitreous hemorrhage occurred in 79 (83%) cases, intraretinal or subretinal hemorrhage in 33 (35%), retinal detachment in 26 (28%), and cataract in 32 (34%). Most of the vitreous and retinal hemorrhages resolved spontaneously, sometimes leaving subretinal or preretinal fibrosis. A number of the postoperative retinal detachments resolved spontaneously, but retinal detachment surgery was necessary in 16 patients (17%), mostly in the earlier years of the survey. Most of the cataracts were mild and did not require surgery. The eventual postoperative visual acuity was equal to or better than the preoperative visual acuity in 23 cases (24%) over a mean follow-up period of 5 years. Enucleation was eventually necessary in 15 cases (16%), usually because of residual or recurrent tumor. Histopathologic diagnosis was uveal melanoma in 81 cases (85%) and other tumors in 14 cases (15%). There were no orbital recurrences, but distant metastases developed in five patients (5%), all of whom had undergone enucleation for recurrence of the intraocular melanoma. Although the surgical technique is difficult, partial lamellar sclerouvectomy appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option in selected cases of posterior uveal tumors. 
Telecanthal approach for meningiomas in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. In three cases involving meningiomas in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, transbasal spreading of the interocular distance (telecanthal approach) was used for tumor removal and reconstruction of the skull base. This telecanthal approach involves 1) bilateral en bloc removal of the superior lateral rim of the orbit, the nasal bone, and the posterior lateral wall of the orbit; 2) detachment of the medial canthal ligaments; and 3) spreading of the interocular distance. This approach provides a wide working space beneath the anterior half of the midline skull base, and needs neither a facial incision nor significant retraction of the brain. The surgical technique and its modification are described. The discussion focuses not only on comparisons with other techniques, but on the indications for this approach. Meningiomas originating in the paranasal sinuses are rare; a brief review of the literature concerning the clinicopathological features and pathogenesis is also given. 
National outcomes of cataract extraction. Endophthalmitis following inpatient surgery. We analyzed the likelihood of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis in 338,141 Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 years who were admitted to US hospitals for cataract extraction in 1984. This cohort represents approximately one half of all persons who underwent cataract extraction under the Medicare program in 1984. Extracapsular extraction was performed in 195,587 (58%) of cases, intracapsular cataract extraction in 99,971 (30%), and phacoemulsification in 28,474 (8%). The risk of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis in the year following surgery was 0.17% for intracapsular cataract extraction compared with 0.12% for extracapsular extraction or phacoemulsification (P less than .002). The risk of endophthalmitis at 1 month was higher for intracapsular cataract extraction than for extracapsular extraction or phacoemulsification (0.11% vs 0.085%), although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Cataract surgery accompanied by anterior vitrectomy increased the 1-month risk of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis to 0.41%, more than a four-fold increase over that for cataract surgery alone (0.09%; P less than .05). The rates of endophthalmitis at 1 year were 0.58% and 0.13%, respectively, for cataract surgery with anterior vitrectomy and cataract surgery alone (P less than .0001). No significant differences in the rate of rehospitalization for endophthalmitis were observed based on the use of an intraocular lens, age, or race. Endophthalmitis within 1 year of surgery was 1.2 times more frequent in men than in women (0.16% vs 0.13%; P = .03). Overall, the likelihood of postoperative endophthalmitis from a national sample is consistent with case series previously reported. 
Plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1 in experimental malignant hypertension. We measured plasma concentrations of immunoreactive endothelin-1 (irET-1) in the prehypertensive and hypertensive phases in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in malignant hypertension caused by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt administration in SHR. We also measured concentrations of this peptide in another model of malignant hypertension, the two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) renovascular hypertensive rats chronically given caffeine. Plasma irET-1 concentrations in young (6-week-old) and mature (18-week-old) SHR did not differ from those of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Four weeks of treatment with DOCA-salt increased blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and plasma irET-1 in SHR but not in WKY rats. Eight weeks of DOCA-salt treatment further increased these values in SHR. Plasma irET-1 concentrations were not increased in the 2K1C rats. Six weeks of caffeine administration increased blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, plasma renin activity, and plasma irET-1 in the 2K1C rats but not in the sham-operated rats. High-performance liquid chromatographic profiles of plasma extracts pooled from these rats with malignant hypertension showed that a major component of irET-1 eluted in the position of synthetic ET-1 (1-21). Furthermore, acute hypertension induced by angiotensin II or phenylephrine did not affect the plasma irET-1 concentration in rats. The results suggested that the plasma ET-1 concentration is increased in rat models of malignant hypertension and that the high blood pressure itself is not the main factor involved in the increase of plasma ET-1. 
Stage B adenocarcinoma of the prostate: transrectal US and pathologic correlation of nonmalignant hypoechoic peripheral zone lesions. Various benign conditions have been found to cause hypoechoic lesions in the prostate gland, thus mimicking the sonographic appearance of early prostatic cancer. Transrectal sonograms in a large series of patients with biopsy-proved clinical stage B prostatic cancer were retrospectively reviewed to determine the pathologic correlate to benign hypoechoic peripheral zone lesions. Transrectal sonograms demonstrated hypoechoic lesions that did not represent cancer in 25 of 160 patients examined. All lesions were contralateral to the carcinoma. Pathologic correlation was found in 24 of the 25 lesions. The results of this study show that contralateral hypoechoic lesions in patients with pathologically proved prostatic cancer do not necessarily imply bilateral tumor involvement; they accounted for benign lesions that mimicked the sonographic appearance of malignant tumors and thus produced a false-positive rate for cancer in the contralateral lobe of 16% of patients (25 of 160) with clinical stage B cancer. 
Comparison of efficacy of automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients older and younger than 65 years of age. PURPOSE: The efficacy of the automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) was compared in elderly patients and younger patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Clinical characteristics, surgical complications, and long-term survival rates were compared between the two age groups. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted of 54 elderly patients (greater than 65 years) and 79 younger patients (less than 65 years) who had had AICDs implanted for recurrent symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation. RESULTS: In 85% of elderly patients and 78% of younger patients, coronary artery disease was the underlying disease (NS). The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 31.4 +/- 14.3% in the elderly patients and 35.7 +/- 17.6% in the younger patients (NS). Concomitant myocardial revascularization was performed in 37% of elderly patients and 29% of younger patients (NS); however, only 4% of elderly patients had concomitant left ventricular resection or cryoablation, compared with 15% of younger patients (p less than 0.001). Two patients in each age group died perioperatively (4% versus 3%, NS), and no significant difference in surgical morbidity or length of hospital stay following AICD implantation was noted between the age groups. In conjunction with AICD, elderly patients more commonly received antiarrhythmic drugs, with 54% of elderly patients taking amiodarone at the time of hospital discharge compared with 29% of the younger patients (p less than 0.008). In contrast, beta-blockers were more commonly used in younger patients (16% versus 2%, p less than 0.03). At a mean follow-up of 25 months, 11 (20%) elderly patients and 16 (20%) younger patients had died. Six deaths in elderly patients and five deaths in younger patients were classified as arrhythmic deaths (NS); however, only one younger patient and three elderly patients died suddenly (NS). Calculated survival curves demonstrated similar survival rates in the two age groups with approximately 90%, 87%, and 80% of the patients alive at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Theoretic survival curves calculated from appropriate AICD shocks demonstrated significantly lower survival compared with actual survival. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that AICD is a very effective treatment for life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and this benefit applies to elderly patients as well as younger patients. 
High incidence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus in alcoholic cirrhosis: fact or fiction? An enzyme immunoassay (Ortho-HCV ELISA) for antibodies against the hepatitis C virus was used to test serum samples from 39 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and 34 patients with alcoholic hepatitis or fatty liver. The frequency of a positive result in the cirrhotics was significantly higher than in the alcoholics without cirrhosis (38.5% vs 8.8%, P less than 0.01). However, the positive results in the cirrhotics were associated with high gammaglobulin concentrations, and optical density values in the assay correlated closely with serum globulin (r = 0.73, P less than 0.01). The findings suggest that serum from patients with alcoholic cirrhosis may contain a component that give false-positive results in the assay. 
Paraesophageal hernia causing colonic obstruction. In a paraesophageal hernia, the esophagogastric junction remains below the hiatus while portions of the fundus or other parts of the stomach herniate in front and to the left of the esophagogastric junction through the hiatus into the thorax. We describe an unusual presentation of a paraesophageal hernia, in which herniation of the splenic flexure of the colon led to colonic obstruction. 
Psychophysiological parameters of migraine and muscle-contraction headaches. Previous headache studies have been unable to verify the presumed presence of headache. Attempting to correct this design fault, the present study assessed four psychophysiological measures (frontalis EMG, temporal BVP, temporal and finger skin temperature) and salient subjective measures in 13 migraineurs, eight muscle-contraction headache sufferers, and 13 age-matched normals. All subjects submitted to two 30-minute sessions of quiet monitoring, and for the headache subjects, one of the sessions was headache active. A bogus, but convincing preliminary "assessment" revealed insufficient headache activity in the headache active session, forcing subjects to reschedule that session in the future when a strong headache was present. A parallel manipulation was employed with the normal subjects. A MANOVA failed to discriminate within- or between-group differences on the psychophysiological measures. Self-reported pain was uncorrelated with the psychophysiological indices. These results cast further doubt on the validity of the psychophysiological measures employed in this study, the same ones routinely endorsed by headache researchers and therapists. We discuss problems of recruitment, compliance, and attrition in basic headache research. 
Effects of dietary calcium on blood pressure, vascular reactivity and vascular smooth muscle calcium efflux rate in Zucker rats. Previous data from this laboratory indicate that hypertension in insulin resistant Zucker obese rats is accompanied by an impairment in vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ efflux. Since insulin resistant states are also generally salt-sensitive and dietary Ca2+ reduces blood pressure in some salt-sensitive states, we evaluated the effects of dietary Ca2+ on blood pressure and vascular reactivity and examined whether these effects are due to increased vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ efflux. We assigned 16 obese and 16 lean rats to a normal (0.5%) or high (1.5%) Ca2+ diet for 28 days, following which intraarterial blood pressure and in vitro vascular smooth muscle 45Ca efflux and vascular reactivity responses to phenylephrine and serotonin were measured. Blood pressure was elevated in the obese rats on both diets (P less than 0.2), and the high calcium diet lowered both systolic and diastolic pressure in both the lean and obese rats (P less than 0.5). Vascular reactivity was higher in the obese rats (P less than 0.2), but dietary Ca2+ exerted opposite effects on vascular reactivity to the agonists. High Ca2+ reduced sensitivity to serotonin in the obese rats by 54% (P less than .05) without affecting sensitivity in the lean rats. In contrast, the high Ca2+ diet increased sensitivity to phenylephrine by 31% in both groups (P less than .01). 45Ca efflux was lower in the obese rats compared to the lean rats (P less than .05), and the high Ca2+ diet increased this rate by 23% in the lean, but not the obese, rats (P less than .05). 
Using anticoagulants safely. Guidelines for therapeutic and prophylactic regimens [published erratum appears in Postgrad Med 1991 Sep 1;90(3):48] Heparin and warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) are used most often to treat acute and recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, arterial disease, valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation. These agents along with dextran, pneumatic compression devices, and gradient stockings are also used to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients at high risk (eg, those with venous stasis, lower limb or spinal cord trauma, clotting abnormalities). Anticoagulation therapy is monitored by maintaining the activated partial thromboplastin time and the prothrombin time in the therapeutic range. 
Clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangement in the infarcted lymph node syndrome. The authors report a case of complete lymph node infarction in which a specific etiology could not be determined by morphologic or immunophenotypic studies; however, clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin gene was demonstrated by Southern blot hybridization of DNA extracted from the necrotic tissue. A subsequent lymph node biopsy later was diagnosed as malignant lymphoma, using morphologic, immunophenotypic and genotypic criteria. Identical clonally rearranged bands were present in DNA from both the infarcted nodal and the subsequent tissue biopsies. In the setting of lymph node necrosis, gene rearrangement studies may provide diagnostic information concerning clonality, even if morphologic and immunophenotypic studies are indeterminate for a lymphoproliferative process. 
Cerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children. Using magnetic resonance imaging 20 language- and learning-impaired children were compared with 12 normal control subjects. Gross brain structure was remarkably normal in the language- and learning-impaired group. Semiautomated morphometry was used to measure hemispheric volumes and cerebral asymmetries in six cerebral regions. The volume of the left posterior perisylvian region was significantly reduced in language- and learning-impaired children. Asymmetries in inferoanterior and superoposterior cerebral regions were also significantly different in this group. Results of descriptive group comparisons of estimated volumes of other cerebral gray-matter structures raise the possibility that some language- and learning-impaired children may have additional volume reductions in cortical and subcortical structures. The results suggest that hemispheric specialization of function may be anomalous in this population. 
Intraovarian abscess treated with laparoscopic aspiration and povidone-iodine lavage. A case report. Intraovarian abscess is an unusual form of pelvic inflammatory disease usually managed with laparotomy. A patient with prolonged morbidity from an intraovarian abscess following pelvic inflammatory disease associated with an intrauterine contraceptive device was managed with laparoscopically guided needle aspiration of the abscess and povidone-iodine lavage. Laparoscopy should play a greater role in the management of pelvic inflammatory disease. 
Hemifacial spasm. Occurrence in multiple sclerosis. We present six patients with hemifacial spasm and multiple sclerosis. To our knowledge, this association has not been described previously in the North American literature. Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all the patients and plaques consistent with multiple sclerosis were identified. In two patients the plaques were seen in the area of the facial nucleus on the involved side. We suggest that hemifacial spasm can be a manifestation of multiple sclerosis. These cases illustrate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging in the investigation of hemifacial spasm. Our findings also support a central (nuclear) origin in multiple sclerosis associated with hemifacial spasm. 
Venous thromboembolism after brain tumor surgery: a retrospective review. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of clinical postoperative deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in 1703 patients undergoing initial craniotomy for meningioma, glioma, or cerebral metastasis. The incidence rate of clinical thromboembolic complications was 1.59% for all tumor groups within the first 4 weeks of surgery. Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups. The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively. Whether this difference was a result of increased surgical time or an inherent property of meningiomas could not be ascertained. 
Elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressures in patients with cryptococcal meningitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Increased intracranial pressure has been a noteworthy problem in some of our patients with cryptococcal meningitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and this appears to be a feature observed in patients with cryptococcal meningitis reported in the literature. Whereas most attention of clinicians is presently focused on optimizing the antifungal regimen, so as to improve on high failure rates in cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS, little attention has been paid to the problem of intracranial hypertension. We argue that visual loss and some of the cases of death early after the onset of chemotherapy may be related to high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, regardless of antifungal therapy. The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed, and we postulate that the mechanism is reduced CSF outflow possibly due to increased outflow resistance, not necessarily accompanied by prominent cerebral edema. Optimal therapy of this complication is not yet established, but some measures that may be helpful are ventricular shunting, frequent high-volume lumbar punctures, and possibly glucocorticoids. 
Barriers to cholesterol testing in a rural community. BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that determine whether residents in a rural community have their cholesterol tested. METHODS. A population-based survey was conducted in 1987 as part of a community-oriented primary care project that sought to define and address the causes of and burden caused by increased cardiovascular disease in an economically depressed agricultural region of New York. All of the residents living in two towns in the region who were over 16 years of age and who lived in their homes year-round were surveyed. Demographic information was obtained from the participants, as well as information about previous cholesterol testing and their cardiovascular-risk knowledge and behaviors. The serum cholesterol of each participant was measured. RESULTS. Of the 557 households contacted, 508 (91%) households participated. A total of 1063 persons over 16 years of age were surveyed, and 973 (92%) were screened for cholesterol. Overall, 24% reported prior cholesterol testing. Logistic regression analysis identified several independent factors that were associated with a reduced likelihood of ever having had a cholesterol test. These factors included: (1) age under 45 years, (2) having less than 12 years of education, (3) having an income of less than $10,000, (4) not having health insurance, (5) not having visited a physician within the previous year, and (6) practicing three or more high-risk cardiovascular behaviors. The participants' cardiovascular knowledge made no independent contribution to having had their cholesterol levels tested. CONCLUSIONS. Many of the factors that prevent cholesterol testing are socially determined. The results of this study suggest that financial and social barriers are two of the major obstacles to residents of rural communities having their cholesterol levels tested. 
Lymphocytic gastritis in nonulcer dyspepsia. The prevalence of lymphocytic gastritis, a specific form of chronic gastritis characterized by infiltration of gastric superficial epithelium with T lymphocytes, has been established in nonulcer dyspepsia. Among a population sample of 586 patients at risk for gastric carcinoma, 0.83% of patients with nonulcer dyspepsia and 1.63% of patients with chronic active gastritis showed lymphocytic gastritis. Among routine gastric biopsies from 5130 patients, only five cases met histological and immunohistochemical criteria of lymphocytic gastritis. 
Sleep apnea in infants who succumb to the sudden infant death syndrome. Previous studies have shown the frequency of respiratory pauses to be altered in groups of infants at risk for the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). In this study, we assess the frequency of apneic pauses during quiet sleep and rapid eye movement sleep in control infants and infants who subsequently died of SIDS. Sleep states were identified in 12-hour physiological recordings of SIDS victims and matched control infants, and the number of respiratory pauses from 4 to 30 seconds in duration was computed for quiet sleep and rapid eye movement sleep. SIDS victims 40 to 65 days of age showed significantly fewer apneic pauses than did age-matched control infants across the two sleep states. Fewer short respiratory pauses accounted for most of the reduction in number of apneic events in the SIDS victims during both sleep states. During the first month of life, SIDS victims did not differ significantly from control neonates on this measure. The finding that this respiratory difference exists during the second month of life, just before the period of maximal risk for SIDS, but not earlier, may have implications for the etiology of SIDS deaths. 
Myeloablative therapy and unpurged autologous bone marrow transplantation for poor-prognosis neuroblastoma: report of 34 cases. From October 1984 to November 1987, 34 patients aged from 1 year 1 month to 7 years 7 months with resistant or relapsed neuroblastoma (NB) (group 1, 10 patients), unselected disseminated NB (group 2, 14 patients), or selected disseminated NB (group 3, 10 patients) received myeloablative therapy (MAT) followed by unpurged autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) at the end of an intensive protocol, which included high-dose chemotherapy and surgery to the primary tumor. Median time from diagnosis to MAT and ABMT was 6 months (5 months from last relapse to MAT and ABMT in the relapsed patients). The MAT regimen included vincristine, fractionated total body irradiation (TBI), and melphalan. Seventeen patients were grafted in complete remission (CR), five in very good partial remission (VGPR), 10 in partial remission (PR), and two in progressive disease (PD). The acute toxic death rate was 2.9%. The overall progression-free survival was 29%. The median progression-free survival was 20 months for the 17 patients grafted in CR, 6 months for the five patients grafted in VGPR, and 12 months for the 10 patients grafted in PR. 
Variation of initial serum bilirubin rise in newborn infants with type of illness. Hyperbilirubinaemia in newborn infants is generally regarded as a problem, and bilirubin itself as toxic metabolic waste, but the high frequency in newborn infants suggests that the excess of neonatal bilirubin may have a positive function. To investigate the hypothesis that bilirubin has a role as a free-radical scavenger, the rate of rise in serum bilirubin in the first few days of life was measured in 44 infants with five illnesses thought to enhance free-radical production and in 58 control infants. The infants were selected from 2700 consecutive births by exclusion of those with factors known to affect bilirubin metabolism, including enteral feeding. The control infants were those who seemed to be ill and received treatment, including restriction of enteral feeds, but in whom no illness, or disorders not related to free-radical production, were found. The mean serum bilirubin rise was significantly lower in the combined illness group than in the control group (36.1 [95% Cl 26.9-45.3] vs 66.7 [55.9-77.5] mumol.l-1.day-1; p less than 0.0001). In subgroup analyses the mean rises in infants with circulatory failure, neonatal depression/asphyxia, aspiration syndromes, and proven sepsis were significantly lower than in controls matched for gestational age and birthweight, but rises in infants with respiratory distress and their matched controls did not differ. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that bilirubin is consumed in vivo as an antioxidant. Such consumption may operate in vivo in addition to the standard pathways for bilirubin metabolism (production, isomerisation, and excretion). 
Stereopsis after unilateral anterior temporal lobectomy. Dissociation between local and global measures. In man, an impairment in stereopsis may occur following damage outside the occipital lobes. If local and global stereopsis can be dissociated, this may imply that different mechanisms mediate these functions. We tested 44 patients with unilateral anterior temporal lobe excisions and 23 normal control subjects on two tasks. In the local stereopsis task, subjects indicated which of two pins varying in disparity between 4 and 512 s of arc was closer. Results showed no threshold impairment in any group. In the global stereopsis task, random-dot stereograms varying in binocular correlation were presented in random order, and subjects indicated if the squares perceived in depth were in front of or behind the screen. At binocular correlations between 50% and 70%, left and right temporal lobectomy resulted in a deficit, which was more marked following right-sided excisions. These results are concordant with earlier work (Ptito and Zatorre, 1988), and with other evidence of a right hemisphere superiority in treating binocular depth information. Moreover, the fact that global stereopsis is impaired in the presence of intact local stereopsis suggests that closely related but not identical mechanisms are involved, and fits the notion that there is a hierarchical organization of the visual pathways originating in the striate cortex leading into temporal cortex. Global stereopsis would thus be mediated in temporal lobe areas that receive information about local disparities from more posterior regions. 
A randomized controlled trial of a 12-month course of recombinant human interferon-alpha in chronic delta (type D) hepatitis: a multicenter Italian study. To determine whether long-term therapy with recombinant interferon-alpha can improve the course of chronic delta hepatitis, 61 Italian patients with this disease were randomly assigned to receive either interferon-alpha-2b three times a week (5 MU/m2 for 4 mo and then 3 MU/m2 for another 8 mo) or no treatment. At the end of the 12-mo study, all patients were followed-up for 12 additional months. Normalization or decrease of more than 50% from baseline of serum ALT levels occurred in 42% of treated patients the fourth month of therapy, 26% the twelfth month and 3% the twenty-fourth month vs. 7%, 7% and 0%, respectively, in the control group. However, relapses occurred in 7 of 8 (87.5%) responders 1 to 10 mo (mean = 3.5 mo) after cessation of therapy. Liver biopsies were carried out at baseline and during the twelfth month of treatment. Histological improvement, mostly caused by decrease of portal inflammation, was observed in 57% of treated and 36% of untreated patients. Measures of antiviral activity (serum hepatitis delta virus RNA and intrahepatic hepatitis delta antigen) showed similar levels in treated and control patients. In treated patients the percentage of patients who were negative for HDV RNA never exceeded that of baseline. Although interferon-alpha in the dosage given in this study had no antiviral effect on patients with chronic hepatitis D, it reduced hepatic inflammation as measured by ALT levels. Whether a longer duration or reinstitution of interferon-alpha therapy would achieve long-term control of ALT levels and prevent chronic liver damage is not known. 
Beriberi heart disease in a schizophrenic with an unusual diet. A 37-year-old male presented with peripheral edema of sudden onset. Other signs of heart failure were absent. Subsequent evaluation revealed that the patient was a schizophrenic whose diet consisted almost entirely of carbohydrates. A clinical diagnosis of beriberi heart disease was made and the patient improved dramatically within several days of thiamine supplementation. The presentation of beriberi heart disease in developed countries is discussed. Emphasis is placed on food faddists and psychiatric patients in whom clinical findings may be subtle or absent. 
Microscopic activity in ulcerative colitis: what does it mean? To determine the prognostic importance of microscopic rectal inflammation we followed up 82 patients (aged 21 to 78 years, 44 men) with chronic quiescent ulcerative colitis over 12 months. At trial entry each patient underwent a rectal biopsy and sections were graded independently by two histopathologists. A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of varying severity was present in all biopsy specimens, and 58% had crypt architectural irregularities. In addition, 32% had evidence of acute inflammatory activity: 28% acute inflammatory cell infiltrate, 11% crypt abscesses, and 22% mucin depletion. Agreement between the two histopathologists for the presence of each of these features was 94% (90-98%). During the 12 month follow up 27 patients (33%) relapsed after a mean interval of 18 weeks (range 3-44 weeks). Relapse rates were unrelated to duration or extent of disease or to the type of maintenance drug treatment. In patients with an acute inflammatory cell infiltrate 52% relapsed, whereas in the absence of such an infiltrate only 25% relapsed (p = 0.02). Similarly, relapse rates were higher in the presence of crypt abscesses (78% v 27%, p less than 0.005), mucin depletion (56% v p less than 0.02), and breaches in the surface epithelium (75% v 31%, p = 0.1). The presence of a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate or crypt architectural irregularities, however, bore no relation to the frequency of colitis relapse. 
The incidence and relationship of cervical spine anomalies in patients with cleft lip and/or palate. The relationship, incidence, and distribution of cervical spine anomalies were assessed in 468 patients with cleft lip and/or palate. The patients were placed into four groups: lip and/or alveolar; complete unilateral or bilateral; isolated palatal; and soft palate or submucous clefts. Cervical anomalies were observed in 22% of the cleft patients and in 7% of the noncleft group. Patients with soft palate and submucous clefts had the highest incidence of vertebral anomalies (45%), whereas patients with cleft lip and/or alveolus had an incidence similar to the noncleft group. Patients with complete unilateral and bilateral clefts also had a higher incidence (15.6% to 19.0%) of anomalies than the noncleft group. Cervical anomalies occurred primarily in the occipital-C1-C2 region. The possible implications of these findings are discussed. 
The use of direct mail to increase clinician knowledge: an intervention study. A probability sample of American general practitioner dentists, 40 years of age or older, in solo private practice, was the target of two direct mail interventions offered at two different times, to test whether knowledge regarding prophylaxis of patients at risk for infective endocarditis could be improved. Tests of knowledge were responses in a mail questionnaire to clinical vignettes, designed to elicit the content of antibiotic regimens used for patients at risk. The research design enabled detection of (1) the effect of the interventions; (2) the differences in their effect; (3) the attenuation of their effect; and (4) the effect of time. Where baseline knowledge was low, it was improved and did not rapidly disappear. Both mail interventions were equally effective, in most instances, and there was no attenuation of the interventions' effect and no effect of time on the control groups' knowledge over a 4 1/2 month period. The results suggest that it is possible to improve clinicians' knowledge of expert recommendations through direct mail intervention. 
Budd-Chiari syndrome in association with Behcet's disease. Budd-Chiari syndrome developed in 3 patients with preexisting Behcet's disease. Benign intracranial hypertension was the chief presenting complaint in one patient, who later suffered extensive inferior vena caval and hepatic vein thrombosis, with manifestations of Budd-Chiari syndrome. She did not respond to treatment and subsequently died of hepatic coma. In the other 2 patients, Budd-Chiari syndrome was confirmed by liver biopsy. Both patients made a good recovery and remain well at the time of this report. 
Biplane transesophageal echocardiography: clinical applications of the long-axis plane. Tomography of the heart and great vessels is limited during conventional transesophageal echocardiography by the inability to rotate the transducer at the end of the transesophageal echocardiographic endoscope. A biplane transesophageal echocardiographic probe has been developed recently with a second transducer capable of long-axis imaging that yields long-axis views in addition to the familiar short-axis views. We describe our experience with 37 patients with a variety of cardiovascular diseases. In 17 patients new diagnostic information was obtained, although management was not changed. Long-axis scanning was particularly useful in the assessment of diseases of the thoracic aorta, valvular morphology and regurgitation, and congenital heart disease. Important limitations of the biplane imaging system include reduced image quality and a continued inability to rotate the transducer to obtain any desired plane of imaging. Nonetheless, biplane imaging enhances the versatility of transesophageal echocardiography and improves three-dimensional conceptualization of cardiac disease. 
Arachnoid cyst of the cerebellopontine angle manifesting as contralateral trigeminal neuralgia: case report. A case of an arachnoid cyst in the cerebellopontine angle manifesting as contralateral trigeminal neuralgia is presented. Decompression and excision of the lesion resulted in total relief of symptoms. The possible causes of contralateral trigeminal neuralgia are briefly reviewed, and the surgical treatment of this entity is discussed. 
Alpha 2-macroglobulin-kallikrein complexes detect contact system activation in hereditary angioedema and human sepsis. Activation of the contact system has been documented in severe sepsis and hereditary angioedema, but a sensitive, specific, and quantitative assay for assessing the degree of involvement of this proteolytic enzyme cascade is not yet available. We have developed a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the alpha 2-macroglobulin-kallikrein (alpha 2M-Kal) complex using an F(ab')2 derivative of a monospecific polyclonal antibody against alpha 2 M as the capture antibody and a unique murine monoclonal antibody, 13G11, against the heavy chain of kallikrein as the detector antibody. The assay does not detect complexes in normal plasma but reacts with complexes generated by activating normal plasma with dextran sulfate at 4 degrees C in a range of 5 to 375 nmol/L. A close correlation of the ELISA with an amidolytic assay for alpha 2M-Kal was documented. Patients with sepsis syndrome but negative bacterial blood cultures did not show elevated plasma complexes, whereas a majority of those with positive blood cultures did show modest elevation and a single patient with septic shock showed a very high level of alpha 2M-Kal complex. Similarly, a patient with classic hereditary angioedema (HAE) showed increased concentration of complexes on three separate occasions during attacks but normal levels between attacks. Two other HAE patients did not show elevated levels at quiescent periods. The ELISA for alpha 2M-Kal appears to be sensitive, specific, and quantitative, and it can be used to reflect the degree of contact system activation in human sepsis and in HAE attacks. 
Progressive loss of speech output and orofacial dyspraxia associated with frontal lobe hypometabolism. Three patients are described with slowly progressive loss of speech and dysarthria associated with orofacial dyspraxia, initially with intact written language, who subsequently developed more widespread cognitive abnormalities. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed bifrontal hypometabolism in all of the patients, most marked in the inferior and lateral portions of both frontal lobes, with some extension into the parietal and temporal cortices in one case. These patients may represent a further example of focal progressive cortical degeneration. 
Mucocutaneous disease in pediatric human immunodeficiency virus infection. Children with HIV infection may develop a wide variety of infectious and inflammatory diseases of the skin. These disorders are often more severe and more difficult to treat than in the healthy child. In some cases, disorders of the skin or mucous membranes may provide an early clue to the presence of pediatric HIV infection. 
Overwhelming necrotizing tracheobronchitis due to inadequate humidification during high-frequency jet ventilation. Necrotizing tracheobronchitis (NT) associated with conventional mechanical ventilation or high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is a lesion reported most often in neonates. In most cases, a specific cause is not identified. We describe a case of NT in an adult that occurred during HFJV and was attributable to inadequate humidification. 
Helicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer. PURPOSE PATIENTS AND METHODS: Helicobacter pylori (HP) is present in more than 90% of duodenal ulcers (DUs). To investigate the pathophysiology in those patients with DU who are HP-negative compared with those who are HP-positive, we interviewed consecutive patients prior to endoscopy regarding factors often associated with ulcer disease. At esophagogastroduodenoscopy, antral biopsy specimens were obtained for urease test, culture, and Warthin Starry staining for HP in all patients with DU who did not have active bleeding. RESULTS: Compared with HP-positive patients who had DU, HP-negative patients with DU were more likely to be aspirin users and less likely to have had prior ulcers. HP-positive patients with DU had more severe antral inflammation than HP-negative patients. Whites were more likely to be HP-negative than blacks. HP-negative patients with DU most commonly presented with bleeding, whereas HP-positive patients with DU presented with pain. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a different mechanism for DUs in patients who are HP-positive versus those who are HP-negative, and this difference might have a bearing on treatment. The absence of HP should lead to a more thorough search for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug/aspirin use, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and other potential causes of DUs. 
Increased MR signal intensity due to cervical myelopathy. Analysis of 29 surgical cases. The cases of 29 patients with cervical myelopathy, who had been treated by anterior spine fusion, were reviewed. The relationship between pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images was investigated with special reference to increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on the T2-weighted images and the relevance of this finding to clinical conditions. Preoperatively, there were areas of increased signal intensity in 12 patients whereas there were no areas of increased signal intensity in the other 17. The lesions were not clearly demonstrated on T1-weighted images. The pre- and postoperative clinical condition of the patients whose preoperative MR images showed areas of increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on T2-weighted images was worse than that of the patients who did not have areas of increased signal intensity. Of the 12 patients with regions of increased signal intensity preoperatively, five showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively compared to the preoperative levels and seven had no change. The postoperative recovery of the five patients who showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively was better than that of the seven patients who exhibited no change. The areas of increased MR signal in the spinal cord might be due to edema, cord gliosis, demyelination, or microcavities. 
Intraosseous vascular malformations of the orbit. Intraosseous vascular malformations are rare benign tumors involving the bones of the orbit. The diagnosis should be considered when a patient presents with an enlarging mass fixed to bone in the upper face, and the characteristic x-ray appearance should be looked for on plain films. Treatment is local excision of the bone containing the tumor and immediate reconstruction with autogenous bone. 
Impedance plethysmography: a new method for continuous muscle perfusion monitoring. Vigilant postoperative monitoring of the buried muscle flap is critical after free transfer because early diagnosis of vascular insufficiency is essential to allow prompt correction. We have identified a monitoring method utilizing needle electrodes and impedance plethysmography that gives a beat-to-beat representation of muscular perfusion. In 25 New Zealand White rabbits the gastrocnemius muscle was isolated on its vascular pedicle, and two intramuscular needle electrodes were placed. The instantaneous impedance changes of the muscle (corresponding to the pulsatile volume changes of perfusion) were measured and recorded. Using this representation of perfusion, an independent judge was able to correctly diagnose muscular ischemia 100 percent of the time (n = 25). Further, the judge was able to correctly distinguish the ischemia as arterial (n = 10) or venous (n = 10) in origin 100 percent of the time. Additionally, we monitored muscle perfusion transcutaneously in five free muscle flaps and demonstrated a reliable impedance signal that correlated with perfusion. 
Importance of antithrombin therapy during coronary angioplasty. Angioplasty procedures with balloons, cutters or lasers all may greatly enlarge the arterial lumen, but luminal diameter may decrease because of mural thrombus in 70% to 80%, smooth muscle proliferation, vasoconstriction or recoil. Thrombin binds to arterial wall matrix and fibrin within a thrombus. Heparin dose-dependently decreases platelet and thrombus deposition but does not eliminate these even at high doses. Specific thrombin inhibition started before angioplasty experimentally prevents mural thrombus and limits platelet deposition to a single layer or less. Experimentally, anticoagulant and antifibrin effects occur at lower antithrombin blood levels and lower activated partial thromboplastin times (1.7 times control). Because platelets are so sensitive to thrombin, the higher level of thrombin inhibition required may occur at a specific level (activated partial thromboplastin time greater than or equal to 2 times control); this is not defined in humans. The duration of therapy is not defined in animals or humans. Thrombus and thrombin may be related to cellular proliferation. 
A pathophysiological interpretation of unresponsiveness to spironolactone in a stepped-care approach to the diuretic treatment of ascites in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients. It has been hypothesized that the magnitude of proximal sodium reabsorption affects the response to aldosterone antagonists in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites. To verify this hypothesis, we evaluated intrarenal sodium handling by lithium clearance in 51 nonazotemic ascitic cirrhotic patients and in 23 controls who were maintained on the same low-sodium diet (80 mmol/day). Seven of 51 cirrhotic patients underwent spontaneous diuresis, whereas 44 required diuretic treatment. Treatment was started with spironolactone at a dose of 150 mg once daily. The dose was increased to 300 mg and then to 500 mg once daily if no response ensued. Cirrhotic patients who did not experience ascites mobilization with 500 mg spironolactone were then treated with a combined diuretic regimen that included spironolactone at a fixed dose (500 mg once daily) and furosemide at an initial dose of 50 mg once daily. The dose was increased to 100, 150 and 200 mg once daily if no response was noticed. Response to diuretic treatment was defined as body weight loss greater than 700 gm every 3 days until ascites became clinically undetectable. Nonresponders (43%) to spironolactone showed lower sodium fractional excretion (0.34% +/- 0.28% vs. 0.80% +/- 0.50%; p less than 0.001) because of a lower fractional sodium delivery to the distal tubule (18.2% +/- 5.8% vs. 23.4% +/- 7.2%; p less than 0.025) than responders. 
Correction of non-24-hour sleep/wake cycle by melatonin in a blind retarded boy. A 9-year-old, blind boy with severe mental retardation with a chronic sleep/wake disturbance had a circadian rhythm of 24.75 hours and an internal desynchronization of the endogenous rhythms. Treatment with oral melatonin given at 6 PM induced a regular sleep/wake pattern. Melatonin, in this patient, convincingly entrained the endogenous rhythm to the appropriate chronological 24-hour day. 
Symptomatic hyponatraemia due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion following minor surgery. A rare case of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion occurring after minor surgery is presented. A ten-year-old, previously healthy boy underwent general anaesthesia for detorsion and right orchiopexy. Throughout the operations, which lasted for one hour, he received 120 ml Ringer's lactate solution. The immediate postoperative period was uneventful. Twenty-two hours postoperatively he was found unconscious with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Simultaneously obtained serum sodium concentration (121 mEq.L-1) serum osmolarity (265 mEq.L-1), urine sodium concentration (87 mEq.L-1) and urine osmolarity (525 mEq.L-1) suggested inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion which was confirmed by an elevated serum arginine-vasopressin (AVP) level of 14.5 pcg.ml-1 (normal 1-5 pcg.ml-1) measured by radioimmune assay. He was treated with a single iv dose of 30 mg furosemide and fluid restriction, which produced a gradual increase of his serum sodium concentration to normal within two days. He was well during the remainder of his hospitalization. 
Epidemiology of colonic symptoms and the irritable bowel syndrome. Functional gastrointestinal disease is believed to be very common, but reports of its prevalence have not usually evaluated random community samples, and validated questionnaires have not been used to elicit symptoms. The prevalence of specific colonic symptoms and the irritable bowel syndrome among representative middle-aged whites was determined from a defined population, and the impact of these symptoms on presentation for medical care was measured. An age- and sex-stratified random sample of 1021 residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, aged 30-64 years, was obtained. All subjects were mailed a valid self-report questionnaire that identified gastrointestinal symptoms and functional gastrointestinal disorders. The response rate was 82% (n = 835). The age- and sex-adjusted prevalence of abdominal pain (more than six times in the prior year) was 26.2 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 23.1-29.2). The prevalence of chronic constipation (hard stools and straining and/or less than 3 stools per week greater than 25% of the time) was 17.4 (95% confidence interval, 14.8-20.0), whereas the prevalence of chronic diarrhea (loose watery stools, and/or greater than 3 stools per day greater than 25% of the time) was 17.9 (95% confidence interval, 15.3-20.5). The prevalence of abdominal pain and disturbed defecation was similar in women and men, except that infrequent defecation and straining at stool were more common in women. Using the Manning symptom criteria to identify irritable bowel syndrome (greater than or equal to 2 of 6 symptoms in those with abdominal pain more than six times in the prior year), the prevalence of irritable bowel syndrome was 17.0 per 100 (95% confidence interval, 14.4-19.6). Overall, 71 persons (9%) reported visiting a physician for abdominal pain or disturbed defecation in the prior year; a subset of variables related to pain severity were the best predictors of health care seeking after adjustment for age and gender. However, these accounted for only 22% of the log likelihood. In conclusion, more than one third of an unselected middle-aged population reported chronic abdominal pain or disturbed defecation, and more than one in six had symptoms compatible with the irritable bowel syndrome. Only a minority had presented for medical evaluation; moreover, the characteristics of the abdominal complaints did not explain the seeking of health care in most cases. 
Hypoprothrombinemia and hemorrhage in a surgical patient treated with cefotetan. For 4 days before surgical repair of a diverticulitic colovesical fistula and for 6 days after, a 63-year-old man was treated with 2 g of intravenous cefotetan disodium every 12 hours for associated urosepsis with bacteremia. Postoperatively, the patient followed a diet of intravenous nutrition only. Uneventful convalescence was interrupted by signs of sudden major blood loss, accompanied by prolonged prothrombin time. After stabilization with packed red blood cells, fresh plasma, crystalloids, and parenteral vitamin K, laparotomy revealed a huge intra-abdominal clot, which was evacuated. This case illustrates the risk of unexpected hypoprothrombinemia and hemorrhage in a cefotetan-treated surgical patient who demonstrated none of the usual comorbid conditions generally described in patients with antibiotic-induced hypoprothrombinemia. Like cefamandole nafate, cefoperazone sodium, moxalactam disodium, and other cephalosporins containing the methylthiotetrazole side chain, cefotetan appears to pose an unusual risk of major bleeding. 
Sticks and stones may break my bones ... reasoning about illness causality and body functioning in children who have a chronic illness. Children's concepts about illness causality and bodily functioning change in a predictable way with advancing age. Differences in the understanding of these concepts in healthy children vs children with a chronic illness have not been clearly delineated. This study included 49 children with a seizure disorder, 47 children with an orthopaedic condition, and 96 healthy children, all with normal intelligence and ranging in age from 5 to 16 years. It demonstrates systematic differences in children's general reasoning skills and in their understanding of concepts about illness causality and bodily functioning, as a function of their age and experience of illness. At all ages, children who had a condition with orthopaedic involvement reported less sophisticated general reasoning and concepts about illness than did healthy children; children with a seizure disorder reported similar general reasoning skills to those of healthy children, but considerably less sophisticated concepts about illness. Children's concepts about body functioning did not differ as a function of the presence of a chronic illness. When their different levels of general cognitive reasoning were statistically controlled, children with a chronic illness had somewhat more sophisticated concepts about bodily functioning than did healthy children. Differences in conceptual development among children with different types of illnesses lead to interesting speculations with regard to the effects of particular illness characteristics on children's cognitive development. 
Wolf blade plate ankle arthrodesis. Fifteen patients, each of whom had a Wolf blade plate ankle arthrodesis, were followed for a mean of 56 months. The mean age at the time of operation was 46.7 years. The preoperative diagnosis was posttraumatic arthritis in 16 cases and one each of degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and avascular necrosis of the talus. Eighteen of the 19 cases fused for a fusion rate of 94.7%. The average fusion position was 2.9 degrees of plantar flexion and 5 degrees of valgus. All patients whose ankle fused were satisfied with their results. The average Mazur postoperative score was 75 (range, 33-91). Five patients had delayed wound healing. The Wolf blade plate is a simple and easy method to fuse the ankle. Minimal dissection is required and a fusion rate of 95% is obtainable. 
Epiglottic laryngoplasty after hemilaryngectomy for glottic cancer. Epiglottic laryngoplasty is technically feasible as a one-stage procedure with excellent functional results. Although the Kambic-Sedlacek-Tucker (K-S-T) technique of glottic reconstruction offers early extubation with an adequate airway, a subsequent wide neoglottis may increase the chance of aspiration and a poor voice. To better restore the laryngeal functions of closure and phonation, we made some modifications on the original K-S-T technique as follows: (1) One of the lateral margins of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic fold is sutured to the arytenoid region of the cricoid rather than a thyroid cartilage remnant. A neo-arytenoid is formed. (2) The other lateral margin of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic fold is sutured to the cut edge of the false and true cord instead of a thyroid ala remnant. Therefore both margins of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic folds are lowered as much as possible to the level of the glottis. A new pseudocord is formed. (3) A cartilage cut is made at the anterior aspect of the epiglottis, leaving its laryngeal surface of mucoperichondrial intact. A new anterior commissure with a sharp angle is shaped by this maneuver. Nineteen hemilaryngectomies with modified epiglottic laryngoplasty have been performed by members of the Department of Otolaryngology of Guangxi Medical College since 1984. Results in this series are fairly good and indicate that the modified epiglottic laryngoplasty is effective in enhancing functional results in terms of respiration, deglutition, and phonation. 
Selective chemical vestibulectomy: preliminary results with human application. The involved membranous labyrinth of patients with medically intractable Meniere's disease is being accessed by means of a fenestration of the bony horizontal semicircular canal in preparation for the application of a 125 or 250 mcg flake of solid streptomycin. Sensory information originating in the affected vestibular end organ is selectively blocked from reaching the central nervous system. This uniformly results in the rapid elimination of vertiginous symptoms, and at these calculated doses yields preservation of (or in some cases improvement in) preoperative cochlear thresholds. The rationale for this procedure, as detailed in earlier investigations of animals, will be briefly reviewed before highlighting our preliminary results in adult clinical trials. 
Acute twin-twin transfusion: a possible mechanism for brain-damaged survivors after intrauterine death of a monochorionic twin. Intrauterine death of one twin in monochorionic pregnancies is associated with increased mortality and morbidity for the survivor. This has been attributed to the consequences of intrauterine disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) initiated by the dead twin. We describe a case in which the fetal cerebral and renal lesions typically found in survivors occurred without any derangement in coagulation. Instead, acute twin-twin transfusion was suggested by the presence of severe anemia in the surviving fetus at delivery. We suggest that the lesions frequently found in the survivors are often due to acute hemodynamic and ischemic changes resulting from acute twin-twin transfusion at the time of intrauterine death, rather than to late-onset DIC. This hypothesis has an important implication for future management: Intervention must occur before intrauterine death if neurologic sequelae in the survivor are to be prevented. 
Priming by platelet-activating factor of endotoxin-induced lung injury and cardiovascular shock. Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a glycerophospholipid known for its unusual potent vasoactive and proinflammatory activities. The present study examined whether PAF might serve as a priming factor in endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) synthesis, cardiovascular shock, and lung injury in anesthetized rats. Intravenous infusion of PAF (1 pmol/kg/min for 60 minutes, n = 5) alone or endotoxin (0.1 micrograms/kg i.v. bolus, n = 5) failed to alter blood pressure, serum TNF alpha and thromboxane B2, platelet and leukocyte count, and hematocrit, nor was lung histology, myeloperoxidase activity, and water content changed. In contrast, the combined administration of PAF and endotoxin markedly elevated serum TNF alpha (1,359 +/- 362 pg/ml, n = 5, p less than 0.01) and thromboxane B2 (43 +/- 5 pg/100 microliters, n = 8, p less than 0.01) along with hypotension, hemoconcentration, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Most notably, the combined regimen caused neutrophil aggregation, adhesion, and accumulation into the lung parenchyma along with platelet-fibrin deposits in postcapillary venules, pulmonary edema, and increased lung myeloperoxidase activity. The role of PAF in this process was confirmed by 1) the prevention of the priming effect by pretreatment with the PAF antagonist BN 50739 (n = 5), and 2) the failure of lyso-PAF, the cardinal nonactive PAF-metabolite, to prime for endotoxin-induced production of TNF alpha (n = 4). These data suggest that PAF could serve as a key mediator in priming for endotoxin-induced tissue injury, especially the typical pulmonary pathophysiology of adult respiratory distress syndrome, a severe pathological outcome of septic shock, burns, and multiple organ injury. 
Alterations in proteoglycan synthesis common to healing wounds and tumors. Wound healing and tumor stroma generation share several important properties, including hyperpermeable blood vessels, extravasation of fibrinogen, and extravascular clotting. In both, the deposits of fibrin gel serve initially as provisional stroma and later are replaced by granulation tissue. Proteoglycans (PG) are also important constituents of the extracellular matrix, but their composition and role in healing wounds and tumor stroma generation are poorly understood. The authors used immunohistochemical and biochemical methods to investigate the dermatan sulfate proteoglycan (DSPG) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) composition of healing skin wounds and solid tumors. By immunohistochemistry, the great majority of normal guinea pig and human dermis stained weakly for CSPG and strongly for decorin. In contrast, the granulation tissue of healing skin wounds and scars stained intensely for CSPG and weakly or not at all for decorin; however decorin staining was restored to normal intensity after digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase, suggesting that decorin antigenic sites had been masked by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Like wounds, the stroma of several carcinomas (line 1 guinea pig, human breast, colon, basal cell, and squamous) stained strongly for CSPG and weakly or not at all for decorin, but decorin staining developed after chondroitin ABC lyase digestion. Thus healing wounds and tumor stroma express a common pattern of altered PG staining, adding another to the properties these pathologic entities share. Proteoglycans extracted from healing wounds after in situ labelling with [35S] Na sulfate contained more CSPG than normal dermis with significantly longer GAG chains. Granulation tissue also synthesized more DSPG than normal skin, with greater heterogeneity and longer GAG chains. These alterations in PG synthesis correlate with the cell proliferation, migration, and collagen synthesis that accompany wound healing and may provide clues to the mechanisms responsible for both wound healing and tumor stroma generation. 
Incidence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis. We conducted a longitudinal follow-up of 72 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) in order to assess gallstone (GS) incidence. The period of survey was 24.5 +/- 12.2 months. Patients were divided into two groups: group I--26 patients with ascites at the start or appearing during follow-up, and Group II--46 patients with compensated LC (no ascites) throughout the survey. During follow-up, 12 of 72 (16.6%) patients developed GS. The global cumulative incidence of GS was 5.5 cases/100 people/year. Age and sex had no influence on the incidence of GS in LC; neither had etiology or cirrhosis. On the contrary, the study revealed a significant increase in the incidence of GS in decompensated cirrhosis. In group I patients, GS appeared more frequently (34.6%) than in group II patients (6.5%) (chi 2 9.479; p less than 0.002). The cumulative incidence of GS was five times higher in decompensated versus compensated LC. 
Mycosis fungoides: cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [published erratum appears in Am Fam Physician 1991 Jun;43(6):1954] Most patients with mycosis fungoides are between 40 and 60 years of age. The disease has three clinical stages: (1) the premycotic, or patch, stage, consisting of macular, scaling, faint pink to red pruritic patches, usually on unexposed surfaces; (2) the mycotic, or plaque, stage, consisting of reddish, purple-brown plaques, often annular in shape and symmetric in distribution, and (3) the tumor stage, consisting of red-brown to violaceous, dome-shaped, firm tumors with a predilection for the face and body folds. The Sezary syndrome is a leukemic variant. Treatment depends on the extent of disease and includes topical or systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy and psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet light therapy. 
Fatal rupture of the intracranial carotid artery during transluminal angioplasty for vasospasm induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage. Case report. The authors report the clinical course, radiographic findings, and gross and microscopic pathology of a patient with fatal rupture of the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery during transluminal angioplasty for subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm. The rupture most likely resulted from a small portion of aneurysm neck which remained unclipped, thereby leaving an area of structural weakness in the arterial wall at the site of clipping. The area of structural weakness predisposed the artery to rupture upon the addition of transmural pressure induced by balloon inflation during transluminal angioplasty. Caution is advised when performing transluminal angioplasty in the region of aneurysm clipping since the vessel lumen "recreated" during the clipping procedure may contain some residual and structurally incomplete aneurysm neck in the vessel wall. 
Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization Obstruction of the uterine (proximal) end of the fallopian tube is noted on up to 20% of hysterosalpingograms and has a variety of underlying causes. Definitive diagnosis and treatment in the past have required laparoscopy or laparotomy with tubal resection. Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization with fluoroscopically guided catheters has emerged as an improved method both for diagnosis and treatment in these patients. Technical success rates for overcoming the obstruction and visualizing distal tubal anatomy range from 76% to 95%. Pregnancy rates after the procedure vary depending on the patient populations studied; however, early results indicate a greater than 50% intrauterine pregnancy rate by 1 year. The rate of ectopic pregnancy is approximately 10% and that of early tubal reocclusion is less than 30%. Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization is recommended as the first intervention in patients with obstruction of the proximal fallopian tube. 
Distribution of BCA-225 in adenocarcinomas. An immunohistochemical study of 446 cases. BCA-225 is a glycoprotein identified in human breast carcinoma cells that has been reported to show a restricted distribution in other human tissues. To further define the presence of BCA-225 in human carcinomas, the authors performed an immunohistochemical study, applying a commercially available monoclonal antibody to BCA-225 to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 446 adenocarcinomas from a variety of sites. BCA-225 expression was found to be common in adenocarcinomas of the breast (98%), kidney (94%), ovary (80%), and lung (74%) but was infrequent in adenocarcinomas of the gastrointestinal tract (10-16%). Adenocarcinomas of the prostate, bile ducts, thyroid, endometrium, endocervix, and pancreas showed an intermediate frequency of BCA-225 expression (36-68%). Although rare tumor cells in three hepatocellular carcinomas showed reactivity for BCA-225, staining of more than 10% of the tumor cells was not seen in any of the 23 hepatocellular carcinomas that were studied. The authors conclude that BCA-225 is expressed commonly in human adenocarcinomas and that it is not a breast-specific antigen. Antibodies to BCA-225 may have utility in helping one to exclude hepatocellular carcinoma in certain clinical settings. 
Carotid endarterectomy in a community hospital: a change in physicians' practice patterns. A total of 243 consecutive carotid endarterectomies (CEA) performed at Providence Medical Center in Portland, Oregon, were retrospectively reviewed over a 22-month period. Of these, 137 patients (56%) underwent CEA for asymptomatic disease, 52 (37%) of whom had stenotic lesions of 79% or less. There were 6 deaths (3%) and 12 strokes (5%). Four strokes were in asymptomatic patients. These data prompted development of criteria for CEA: (1) hemisphere-specific transient ischemic attacks, reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, or amaurosis fugax with an appropriate carotid lesion; (2) completed stroke with major recovery and significant carotid stenosis; (3) asymptomatic lesion with greater than 80% stenosis (D+) either by carotid arteriogram or non-invasive lab evaluation; and (4) other indications only with a supporting second opinion from a disinterested vascular surgeon, neurosurgeon or neurologist. A prospective review followed institution of the guidelines. In 21 months, 148 operations were performed, a 36% reduction over the initial study period. Of these, 46 (31%) were for asymptomatic lesions. Two patients (4%) did not fulfill the guideline criteria. There were six strokes (4%) and no deaths. The reduction of CEAs appears to be related to a significant decrease in "inappropriate" operations being performed. Surgeons' familiarity with the data rather than external pressures seems to be the major factor in changing practice patterns. The decrease in stroke/death rate is not statistically significant. 
Transcutaneous oxygen tensions in assessing the treatment of healed venous ulcers Transcutaneous oxygen tension (Ptc,O2) was assessed as an indicator of risk of reulceration in 68 limbs with healed venous ulcers. Ptc,O2 was also used to assess two methods of ulcer prophylaxis. Measurements were made over the gaiter skin, the healed ulcer and the upper arm. The results were expressed as a ratio of the lower limb readings over those taken from the arm. Patients were randomized, after the ulcer had healed, to elastic stockings and stanozolol, or elastic stockings and surgical ligation of incompetent superficial veins. Patients who declined to participate in the study were prescribed elastic stockings only. Those limbs remaining healed at 12 months had Ptc,O2 ratios remeasured. The Ptc,O2 ratios from limbs that reulcerated were not significantly lower than those from limbs remaining healed. The Ptc,O2 ratio was significantly increased in limbs treated by stanozolol and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05) and by surgery and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05). There was no significant increase in Ptc,O2 in limbs treated by elastic stockings alone. In those treated by surgery and elastic stockings, there was a significant improvement in limbs with normal deep veins (P less than 0.01), but not in limbs with post-thrombotic changes on ascending phlebography. Although these two methods of ulcer prophylaxis improve the Ptc,O2 ratio, a high ratio has not been shown to be beneficial in preventing ulcer recurrence. 
Improving compliance in an inner-city hypertensive patient population. Because hypertension is a "silent" disease process, compliance with therapy is always a problem. In the inner city, where socioeconomic factors such as poverty, illiteracy, and substance abuse raise additional barriers to effective health care, poor compliance with antihypertensive regimens can reach epidemic proportions--as it did in our clinic in the early 1970s. After identifying the major causes of poor compliance in our patients, we instituted measures that led directly to greatly improved compliance and control, among them the expansion of clinic hours, the expediting of laboratory services, and the training of nurse-therapists to assume many of the responsibilities of running the clinic. In recent years a number of new antihypertensive agents have been introduced, and these new drugs have afforded patients better blood pressure control through less complex drug regimens with fewer serious side effects. Indeed, we observed a strong correlation between patient compliance and the administration of agents with longer dosing intervals and improved side effects profiles. This observation led us to consider whether transdermal clonidine--which requires weekly, rather than daily, administration--might not be an especially effective means of controlling blood pressure in inner-city patients. To test this hypothesis, we enrolled 20 patients, all of them blacks, in a pilot study of this unique delivery system. Blood pressure was adequately controlled in all 18 patients who completed the study, and patients were uniformly enthusiastic about this alternative to daily dosing. As a result, compliance with this mode of therapy was excellent. 
Cardioreparative effects of lisinopril in rats with genetic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. BACKGROUND. In genetic and acquired hypertension, a structural remodeling of the nonmyocyte compartment of the myocardium, including the accumulation of fibrillar collagen within the interstitium and adventitia of intramyocardial coronary arteries and a medial thickening of these vessels, represents a determinant of pathological hypertrophy that leads to ventricular dysfunction. METHODS AND RESULTS. To evaluate the benefit of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition in reversing this interstitial and vascular remodeling in the rat with genetic spontaneous hypertension (SHR) and established left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), we treated 14-week-old male SHR with oral lisinopril (average dose, 15 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Myocardial stiffness and coronary vascular reserve to adenosine (800 micrograms/min) were examined in the isolated heart; myocardial collagen and intramural coronary artery architecture were analyzed morphometrically. In lisinopril-treated SHR compared with 14-week-old baseline or 26-week-old untreated SHR and age- and sex-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls, we found 1) a regression in LVH and normalization of blood pressure, 2) a complete regression of interstitial fibrosis, represented by a decrease of interstitial collagen volume fraction from 7.0 +/- 1.3% to 3.2 +/- 0.3% (p less than 0.025; WKY, 2.8 +/- 0.5%), 3) normalization of myocardial stiffness constant from 19.5 +/- 0.9 to 13.7 +/- 1.3 (p less than 0.025; WKY, 13.8 +/- 2.2), 4) a reversal of intramural coronary artery remodeling, including a decrease in the ratio of perivascular fibrosis to vessel lumen size from 1.4 +/- 0.2 to 0.4 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.025; WKY, 0.6 +/- 0.1) and medial thickening from 12.3 +/- 0.6 to 7.4 +/- 0.5 microns (p less than 0.005; WKY, 7.4 +/- 0.4 microns), and 4) a restoration of coronary vasodilator response to adenosine from 12.3 +/- 0.9 to 26.0 +/- 1.4 ml/min/g (p less than 0.005; WKY, 21.8 +/- 2.2 ml/min/g). Thus, in SHR with LVH and adverse structural remodeling of the cardiac interstitium, lisinopril reversed fibrous tissue accumulation and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries and restored myocardial stiffness and coronary vascular reserve to normal. CONCLUSIONS. These cardioreparative properties of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may be valuable in reversing left ventricular dysfunction in hypertensive heart disease. 
Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (Pena-Shokeir phenotype) associated with acquired intrauterine brain damage. An infant with Pena-Shokeir phenotype was born to a cocaine-using mother. The pathologic findings included polyhydramnios, facial anomalies, arthrogryposis, camptodactyly, pulmonary hypoplasia, and tetralogy of Fallot. The neuropathologic findings were diffuse brainstem and spinal cord neuronal degeneration and focal cerebral infarction, consistent with acquired intrauterine ischemic damage. 
Diagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct: usefulness of lymphangiography and CT. The usefulness of lymphangiography and CT in the diagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct was evaluated in 12 patients with chylothorax or chylous ascites after surgery. Bipedal lymphangiography was performed in all 12 patients. The last four patients studied also had CT after lymphangiography. Seven patients had abnormal findings on lymphangiograms; five with leaks from the thoracic duct, one with a lymphocele in a nephrectomy bed, and one with obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels after thoracotomy. Five patients had no evidence of lymphatic leakage. CT in one patient with evidence of a leak on lymphangiography showed extravasation of contrast medium into the mediastinum and pleural space. CT in three patients with no abnormalities on lymphangiography also showed no abnormalities. Four of the five thoracic duct lacerations and the lymphocele were confirmed surgically. The diagnosis of obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels was supported clinically. Four of the five patients with normal findings on lymphangiograms had resolution of their pleural effusions and no evidence of recurrence during a follow-up period of 1-27 months. One patient with normal findings on lymphangiography had an alternative diagnosis established at surgery. Laceration of the thoracic duct was accurately diagnosed and localized with lymphangiography, which allowed definitive surgical repair. CT was of little additional value in diagnosing these injuries. 
Bacterial infection and peripheral vascular disease. Whole blood filterability was monitored in 16 nondiabetic peripheral vascular disease (PVD) patients within forty-eight hours of onset of bacterial infection, after ten to seventeen days antibiotic therapy and again, ten days later, after convalescence. The whole blood filterability rate was constantly disturbed before infection in these patients; the impairment worsened significantly (as was expected during infection), but after convalescence the whole blood filterability rate did not return to preinfection levels. This further significant impairment in whole blood filterability was inversely correlated with a reduction in the patients' pain-free walking time as determined by a standard treadmell test performed after convalescence and compared with their average times before infection. 
Intra-ocular pressure variations during extracorporeal circulation and some influencing factors. Intra-ocular pressure (IOP) variations during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) and some influencing factors were studied prospectively in 38 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. IOPs were measured pre-operatively, during ECC (after 5 min, 10 min, 25 min and every 15 min thereafter), and on the 1st, 2nd and 3rd postoperative days. IOP, haematocrit, arterial perfusion pressure, partial O2 pressure, partial CO2 pressure, pH and blood bicarbonate levels were measured simultaneously. After the beginning of ECC, arterial perfusion pressure and haematocrit values decreased suddenly, while IOP raised immediately. Sudden increase of blood volume in the beginning of ECC can be the probable cause of IOP elevation. Afterwards, IOP levels decreased to pre-ECC levels. We think that the drop is due to the effect of mannitol in the priming solution and hyposecretion of aqueous humour due to insufficient nutrition-oxygenation of corpus ciliaris after haemodynamic stabilization. 
Cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis in total hip replacement. A theoretical analysis was performed regarding the cost-effectiveness in terms of lives saved (reduction of fatal pulmonary embolism [PE]) and in terms of money (dollars spent for prevention and treatment) of seven strategies in the management of venous thromboembolic disease in patients over 39 years of age undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR). Strikingly, this theoretical analysis suggests that low-dose warfarin combined with clinical surveillance of deep vein thrombosis would reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 20 per 1,000 patients to 4 per 1,000 patients and simultaneously reduce the charges for venous thromboembolic disease from $550,000 to about $400,000 per 1,000 patients. Based on this analysis, we strongly recommend this measure on a routine basis. Adding venography or duplex sonography routinely to this prophylactic regimen would, in this theoretical analysis, reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 4 per 1,000 patients to 0.15 per 1,000, but adds charges of $200,000 per extra life saved in the case of routine venography and $50,000 in the case of routine sonography. Low-dose warfarin prophylaxis combined with routine sonography does not generate more charges than no prophylaxis with no screening while drastically reducing the incidence of fatal PE from 20 to 0.3 per 1,000 patients. Where duplex sonography is not easily available, a 12-week postoperative course of low-dose warfarin for every patient with no routine screening will be efficacious in reducing fatal PE and as cost-effective. 
Treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts with octreotide. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common and painful complication of chronic pancreatitis. Seven patients (six male, one female; mean age 49.9 years) with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts and persistent pain were treated with the pancreatic anti-secretory drug octreotide for 2 weeks. Octreotide caused no notable changes in the size of the pseudocysts of three patients. In the remaining four patients, the pseudocysts decreased in size by a mean of 42% (range 29-52%), and pain disappeared completely. These findings suggest a role for octreotide in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. 
A simple radiologic method to estimate the quantity of bowel gas. Patients with functional bowel disorders frequently complain of bloating and abdominal pain, but no practical method is available to measure intestinal gas objectively. To evaluate a new technique, we evaluated 54 abdominal radiographs from 19 patients. A gastroenterologist and a radiologist independently outlined the intestinal gas bubbles in these films. Areas of gas bubbles were measured with a computer digitizing board. Bowel gas was also measured in 24 healthy controls, and in five emergency room patients, supine and erect radiographs were compared to evaluate the effects of position on bowel gas patterns. The two evaluators agreed well on the measured areas of bowel gas (r = 0.96), showing that this is a reliable method. Bowel gas was significantly greater in patients than in controls but did not correlate with symptoms. Bowel gas was significantly greater in supine than upright films, showing that the position of the patient must be standardized. 
Primary angiosarcoma of adrenal gland presenting as paraneoplastic syndrome: case report. Angiosarcoma is an uncommon neoplasm that rarely involves the adrenal gland. We report on a patient with primary angiosarcoma of the adrenal gland who presented with symptoms best characterized as a paraneoplastic syndrome. 
Reversal of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive lung disease by inspiratory assistance with a face mask. BACKGROUND. Patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may require endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation. We designed, and here report on the efficacy of, a noninvasive ventilatory-assistance apparatus to provide inspiratory-pressure support by means of a face mask. METHODS. We assessed the short-term (45-minute) physiologic effects of the apparatus in 11 patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy in 13 such patients (including 3 of the 11 in the physiologic study) who were treated for several days and compared with 13 matched historical-control patients. RESULTS. In the physiologic study, after 45 minutes of inspiratory positive airway pressure by face mask, the mean (+/- SD) arterial pH rose from 7.31 +/- 0.08 to 7.38 +/- 0.07 (P less than 0.01), the partial pressure of carbon dioxide fell from 68 +/- 17 mm Hg to 55 +/- 15 mm Hg (P less than 0.01), and the partial pressure of oxygen rose from 52 +/- 12 mm Hg to 69 +/- 16 mm Hg (P less than 0.05). These changes were accompanied by marked reductions in respiratory rate (from 31 +/- 7 to 21 +/- 9 breaths per minute, P less than 0.01). Only 1 of the 13 patients treated with inspiratory positive airway pressure needed tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation, as compared with 11 of the 13 historical controls (P less than 0.001). Two patients in each group died. As compared with the controls, the treated patients had a more transient need for ventilatory assistance (3 +/- 1 vs. 12 +/- 11 days, P less than 0.01) and a shorter stay in the intensive care unit (7 +/- 3 vs. 19 +/- 13 days, P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS. Inspiratory positive airway pressure delivered by a face mask can obviate the need for conventional mechanical ventilation in patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Occlusive peripheral vascular disease: a multicenter trial of fluorescence-guided, pulsed dye laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Fluorescence-guided, laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was performed in 129 patients with iliac and femoropopliteal artery chronic occlusions (range, 0.5-50.0 cm; mean length, 9.9 cm) after failure of recanalization with standard guide-wire techniques. Laser recanalization and short-term angiographic success were achieved in 101 (72%) and 95 (68%) of 140 occlusions, respectively. Laser and balloon angioplasty failures were encountered in heavily calcified plaques or after perforations and dissections. Complications included perforations (19%), hematomas (5%), thromboses (4%), and distal embolizations (4%). Real-time fluorescence spectroscopy identified thrombus, white fibrous plaque, and media but could not avoid perforations in many cases because laser wire advancement outdistanced fluorescence sensing. Disruption of tissue by means of pressure transients and/or mechanical advancement occurred in at least 36% of lesions where the laser energy was insufficient (less than 0.4 J/cm) to ablate significant tissue. Integration of fluorescence guidance with pulsed dye laser ablation is feasible, but additional refinements are necessary to increase safety and efficacy. 
Predicting chemically induced duodenal ulcer and adrenal necrosis with classification trees. Binary tree-structured statistical classification algorithms and properties of 56 model alkyl nucleophiles were brought to bear on two problems of experimental pharmacology and toxicology. Each rat of a learning sample of 745 was administered one compound and autopsied to determine the presence of duodenal ulcer or adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis. The cited statistical classification schemes were then applied to these outcomes and 67 features of the compounds to ascertain those characteristics that are associated with biologic activity. For predicting duodenal ulceration, dipole moment, melting point, and solubility in octanol are particularly important, while for predicting adrenal necrosis, important features include the number of sulfhydryl groups and double bonds. These methods may constitute inexpensive but powerful ways to screen untested compounds for possible organ-specific toxicity. Mechanisms for the etiology and pathogenesis of the duodenal and adrenal lesions are suggested, as are additional avenues for drug design. 
Therapeutic defibrination with ancrod does not protect canine myocardium from reperfusion injury. The purpose of this study was to determine whether normal fibrinogen contributes to the development of myocardial reperfusion injury by acting as a substrate in vivo for neutrophil adhesion. This was tested in a dog model of acute myocardial infarction that used pentobarbital anesthetized dogs subjected to 90 min regional myocardial ischemia and 5 h reperfusion. Dogs were treated with 1 unit/kg Ancrod (venom from the Malayan pit viper, Agkistrodon rhodostoma) or vehicle i.v. 60 min after left circumflex coronary artery occlusion. Therapeutic defibrination was verified in Ancrod-treated dogs by measurements of clottable fibrinogen, alpha-2 antiplasmin and plasminogen, by the activated partial thromboplastin time and by immunoelectrophoresis. Fibrinogen was depleted to below detectable limits of the assay (less than 0.05 mg/ml) after treatment with Ancrod. The defibrination effect was accomplished by the expected activation of the fibrinolytic system: alpha-2 antiplasmin was decreased by 10% and plasminogen activity was decreased by 30% with Ancrod treatment. There were no measureable differences between the two treatment groups in heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, rate pressure product or circumflex coronary blood flow throughout the 90 min of regional ischemia or during the 5 h of reperfusion. The relative severity of ischemia between the two treatment groups was similar when assessed with radiolabeled microsphere measurement of myocardial blood flow. The accumulation of neutrophils (measured by myeloperoxidase activity) within the myocardium after reperfusion was not reduced by prior depletion of fibrinogen. 
Foreign body in the gastrointestinal tract: intraluminal migration of laparotomy sponge. We have reported a case of complete transluminal migration of a retained laparotomy sponge that caused repeated partial small bowel obstruction. Diagnosis was made when roentgenograms showed multiple positions of the laparotomy marker. The sponge was surgically removed. This is the 69th reported case of complete transluminal migration and distal movement of a laparotomy sponge. 
Ceftazidime as monotherapy or combined with teicoplanin for initial empiric treatment of presumed bacteremia in febrile granulocytopenic patients. In a prospective randomized study, 120 febrile, granulocytopenic patients received as initial therapy ceftazidime with or without teicoplanin. At the onset of fever, patients had no obvious infectious focus. For 103 assessable episodes, initial bacteremias were detected in 18 of 51 patients (35%) given ceftazidime and 20 of 52 patients (38%) given the combination; 13 and 17 bacteremias caused by gram-positive bacteria occurred in these groups, respectively. There was no difference in terms of the final response (25 of 51 patients [49%] treated with ceftazidime alone versus 33 of 52 patients [63%] given the combination), and the morbidity was comparable for both treatment groups. The duration of fever and of total antibiotic therapy were similar in both groups. Initial therapy was modified in 26 patients (51%) treated with ceftazidime, with 20 surviving the infection, and in 19 patients (37%) treated with the combination, with 15 surviving. Persistent fever was the main reason for changing treatment, and no patient died of a gram-positive infection. Subsequent infective events occurred in 16 patients (31%) given ceftazidime and in 25 patients (48%) given the combination. Lung infiltrates developed in 12 and 13 patients, respectively, but more new infections occurred in the combination group. Allergic skin reactions were also more frequent in this group. Thus, while teicoplanin provides simple, reliable, and safe treatment of patients with presumed gram-positive infections, it is not useful when given empirically to this patient population, and treatment may result in more infective complications and adverse events. 
Pulmonary mass and air meniscus sign in a 19-year-old man. Sacrococcygeal teratoma is rarely diagnosed in adults. Pulmonary mass as the presenting clinical form of the malignant variety of this germ-cell tumor is exceptional. We report herein such a case with the noticeable peculiarity of showing the air meniscus sign on chest roentgenographic examination. 
Occult papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid--a potential pitfall of fine needle aspiration cytology? The use of fine needle aspiration cytology detected papillary carcinoma in two patients with multinodular goitre measuring 0.7 cm and 0.9 cm in diameter, respectively. Like most of the cases from previous large series, the tumours progressed slowly as shown by absence of enlarged glands on surgical exploration and no clinical signs of metastasis after two and five years of follow up. This study shows that aspiration cytology can detect a virtually harmless occult papillary carcinoma that will oblige patients to have surgery. This very occasional "pitfall" of fine needle aspiration should not preclude this well known beneficial method from being used in the management of thyroid disease. 
The risk of axillofemoral bypass grafting for acute vascular occlusion. The hypothesis of the present study is that axillofemoral bypass grafting for acute vascular occlusion has results significantly inferior to an elective procedure. We reviewed 53 patients undergoing primary axillofemoral bypass grafting at the University of Virginia from 1984 to 1989. We found that patients who were admitted with acute vascular occlusion had a higher incidence of perioperative complications (63% vs 26%, p = 0.001), perioperative mortality (26% vs 3%, p less than 0.05), lower graft patency at 1 year (60% vs 90%, p less than 0.05), lower rate of freedom from reoperation in first year (50% vs 82%, p less than 0.01), and lower rates of limb salvage (76% vs 94%, p less than 0.05) than patients undergoing axillofemoral bypass grafting for chronic symptoms or conditions. These two groups did not differ in any of the other risk factors or perioperative characteristics examined. We conclude axillofemoral bypass grafting performed for indications other than acute vascular occlusion is associated with acceptable morbidity, mortality, graft patency, and limb salvage rates. 
Thermographic observations on rats with experimental neuropathic pain. Infrared thermographic images were obtained from the plantar hind paws of rats with an experimental nerve injury that produces signs of neuropathic pain. Thermograms confirmed that the experimental neuropathy produces signs resembling those of patients with neuropathic pain. The hind paws on the nerve-damaged side were abnormally hot, abnormally cold, or apparently normal 8-16 days post injury, a variability that is seen clinically in neuropathic pain patients. Abnormally cold hind paws became warm as soon as the injured sciatic nerve was transected, indicating that the underlying vasoconstriction was mediated by neural impulse activity. Xylazine (Rompun), a sympatho-inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist that normally increases cutaneous temperature, caused the hind paw on the control side to warm, as anticipated, while causing paradoxical cooling of abnormally hot hind paws, and even of 'normal temperature' paws on the nerve-injured side. These findings shed light on possible mechanisms underlying abnormal deviations of skin temperature as a symptom of nerve injury. The findings also attest to the usefulness of the experimental animal model of neuropathic pain and of the thermographic method. 
DuP 753 increases survival in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats fed a high sodium diet. We studied the effects of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist, DuP 753, on blood pressure, body weight, plasma renin activity, sodium excretion, and mortality in male stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRsp) fed a 4% NaCl diet for 12 weeks. The rise in blood pressure, due to high sodium intake, was blunted in the first 8 weeks of the study in the DuP 753-treated group; however, it started slowly to rise in the following weeks. In the untreated group, blood pressure rose steadily and it was significantly higher than that of the treated group during the whole experimental period. DuP 753-treated rats gained weight continuously during the study in contrast to the untreated group, where weight gain was arrested after 4 weeks. Plasma renin activity rose significantly after 4 weeks of treatment with DuP 753; by week 6 its values returned to baseline values and remained at these lower values until week 12. In the untreated group, plasma renin activity was not suppressed by high sodium intake after 4 weeks; it continued to rise and it was significantly elevated by 8 and 12 weeks. Survival at 12 weeks was 84% in DuP 753-treated group and 26% in the untreated group. The data demonstrate that DuP 753 decreased mortality and dramatically blunted the blood pressure rise in SHRsp fed a high sodium diet. 
Cystic cerebellar schwannoma: case report. We report a case of cerebellar schwannoma in a 64-year-old woman. The tumor was defined on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans and confirmed on surgery. The solid part of the tumor appeared to be derived from the inferior vermis of the cerebellum, the cystic part extending toward the medulla oblongata and the foramen magnum. The problem of preoperative diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging findings is discussed. 
The value of portable chest roentgenography in adult respiratory distress syndrome. Comparison with computed tomography. In 17 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome, we used data derived from computed tomographic (CT) scan densitometric analysis to validate the value of portable chest roentgenograms in objectively estimating the amount of pulmonary edema. Chest roentgenograms and CT scans were taken in the same ventilatory conditions (apnea at 10 cm H2O of positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP]); blood gas samples and hemodynamic parameters were collected at the same time. Roentgenographic analysis was undertaken by independent observers using two standardized scoring systems proposed in the literature. CT scan analysis was performed using the CT number frequency distribution and the gas lung volume (measured by helium dilution technique) to estimate quantitatively the lung density, the lung weight, and the percentage of normally aerated and nonaerated tissue. Knowing the mean CT number of the pulmonary parenchyma in a group of normal subjects, we also inferred the ideal lung weight expected in the study population and computed the excess tissue mass as the difference between actual and ideal lung weight. Both the roentgenographic scoring systems showed direct correlation with the pulmonary impairment as detected by CT scan densitometric analysis (CT number, percentage of nonaerated tissue, lung weight, and excess tissue mass; p less than 0.01) and inverse relation with the percentage of normally aerated tissue (p less than 0.01). We also found a relationship between roentgenographic scores and the impairment in gas exchange as detected by shunt fraction (p less than 0.05). We conclude that standardized reading of portable chest roentgenograms by means of scoring tables is a valuable tool in estimating the amount of pulmonary edema in a patient with adult respiratory distress syndrome. 
Which asymptomatic patients should undergo routine screening carotid duplex scan? The benefits of obtaining a routine screening carotid duplex scan have not been established for patients with peripheral vascular disease but no signs or symptoms of carotid artery disease. We retrospectively reviewed all carotid duplex scans (4,000) performed at our institution between 1985 through 1989 and found for analysis 91 scans in 78 patients who underwent a screening duplex scan because of the presence of peripheral vascular disease. Patients with carotid bruits, abnormal carotid pulses, and focal or nonspecific neurologic symptoms were excluded. Thirty-three percent of these patients had carotid stenosis of 16% to 50%, 14% had carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, and 5% had stenosis greater than or equal to 75%. Individual risk factors for atherosclerosis, including elderly age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and a recent or past history of cardiac or vascular surgery, did not predict the detection of high-grade carotid stenosis. However, all 11 of the patients with carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50% were 68 years of age and older, and this age range, in combination with the various risk factors, increased the incidence of significant carotid artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 50%) to as high as 45%. We conclude that routine screening carotid duplex scan is indicated in elderly patients (age greater than or equal to 68 years) with peripheral vascular disease, even in the absence of any signs or symptoms of carotid artery disease, when other atherosclerotic risk factors are present. 
Inhibitory effects of the gastrin receptor antagonist (L-365,260) on gastrointestinal tumor cells. A selective gastrin receptor (GR) antagonist, L-365,260 is bound to the GR on AR42J cells with a potency 7.5-fold less than G17 (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] G17, 6 x 10(-9) mol/l; IC50 L365-260, 4.5 x 10(-8) mol/l). G17 is mitogenic for AR42J cells, as assessed by 75Se-selenomethionine uptake and L-365,260 at concentrations of 2.5 x 10(-6) mol/l and 2.5 x 10(-7) mol/l, (55X and 5.5 X the dose required to displace 50% 125I G17, respectively), and reduced optimal G17 stimulated mitogenesis in 75% of experiments. The basal growth of two human colon cancer cell lines, LoVo and C146 was reduced by L-365,260 (2.5 x 10(-7) mol/l) after 5 days of treatment to 44% and 64% of the control, respectively. However, inhibition was followed by a rebound of growth to control levels. The growth of AR42J xenografts in nude mice was increased by administration of G17 (10 micrograms/mouse/d, P less than 0.027). This increase was blocked by coadministration of oral L-365,260 (5 mg/kg/d, P less than 0.034). L-365,260 could be an important therapeutic agent in slowing the growth of GR-positive, G17-sensitive gastrointestinal tumors. 
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis. A quantitative analysis of motion, gait, and femoral remodeling after in situ fixation. A prospective clinical study was done for quantitative examination of motion of the hip, gait, and proximal femoral remodeling after in situ fixation of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis. In situ fixation was performed in forty-five consecutively treated patients (fifty-six hips). Thirty-nine (87 per cent) of the patients returned for examination two years after treatment. The greatest percentage of motion of the hip returned within six months after treatment. Despite loss of internal rotation of the hip, the mean foot-progression angle was 10.8 degrees. Radiography and computerized tomographic scanning revealed minimum change in the relationship of the femoral head to the femoral shaft and no change in the neck-shaft angle. Motion returned despite minimum osseous remodeling. The early return of motion (in the first three months) may have been due to relief of pain, spasm, and synovitis, while soft-tissue stretching and resorption of bone in the anterolateral part of the femoral neck may have accounted for the remainder of the increase in internal rotation. 
Dissection of the protein kinase cascade by which nerve growth factor activates MAP kinases. Mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinases (MAPKs) are a family of protein-serine/threonine kinases activated as an early intracellular response to a variety of hormones and growth factors. They are unique in requiring both serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation to become active and are the only examples of protein-serine/threonine kinases activated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Nerve growth factor (NGF) promotes differentiation of phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells, which respond by conversion within hours from a chromaffin-like to a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype. NGF stimulation of PC12 cells increases the activity of two protein kinases by greater than 20-fold within minutes, both strikingly similar to MAPKs. They are inactivated by either protein-tyrosine phosphatases or the protein-serine/threonine phosphatase termed protein phosphatase 2A (ref. 8), they activate protein S6 kinase-II (refs 9, 10), and they phosphorylate identical threonine residues on myelin basic protein (our unpublished results) to those phosphorylated by other MAPKs. Immunological data indicate that these protein kinases, termed peak-I and peak-II (Fig. 1a) are probably ERK2 and ERK1, respectively, two widely expressed MAPK isoforms. Here we identify the 'MAP kinase kinases' (MAPKKs) in PC12 cells which are activated by NGF and report that MAPKKs are dependent on serine/threonine phosphorylation for activity and promote phosphorylation of serine/threonine and tyrosine residues on MAPKs. 
Assessment of a daily combined preparation of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide in a controlled trial of three 6-month regimens for smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Singapore Tuberculosis Service/British Medical Research Council In a study in Singapore 310 patients with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were allocated at random to daily chemotherapy with streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide (1) for 2 months (2SHRZ), (2) for 1 month (1SHRZ), or (3) for 2 months without streptomycin (2HRZ). This was followed for all patients by three times weekly isoniazid and rifampin to a total duration of 6 months. During the initial period of daily chemotherapy the patients were also allocated at random to be given their HRZ either as a combined formulation (Rifater), each tablet containing 50 mg isoniazid, 120 mg rifampin, and 300 mg pyrazinamide, or as three separate drugs. During the Rifater versus separate drugs comparison the most common spontaneous complaints were of nausea and vomiting, reported by 8% of 155 patients receiving Rifater and 7% of 155 separate drugs. Other adverse effects were also reported in similar proportions in the two series. Among 271 patients with drug-susceptible strains of tubercle bacilli pretreatment there were no bacteriologic failures during chemotherapy. During 18 months of subsequent follow-up bacteriologic relapse occurred in 3 (7%) of 46 2SHRZ, 2 (5%) of 42 1SHRZ, and 3 (8%) of 40 2HRZ patients allocated to Rifater and in 0 of 47 2SHRZ, 1 (2%) of 46 1SHRZ, and 1 (2%) of 44 2HRZ patients allocated to separate drugs. There was no evidence of therapeutic benefit from continuing SHRZ administration beyond 1 month or from adding streptomycin to HRZ. The relapse rates were slightly higher in the Rifater series (p = 0.04). Further follow-up and results from other studies are therefore needed fully to assess the combined preparation. 
Heart rate response during exercise testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring in patients with syndrome X. The response of the heart rate during exercise testing and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring performed with patients not receiving antianginal treatment was assessed in 26 patients (9 men and 17 women; mean age 51 +/- 8 years) with syndrome X (angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries), in 27 patients with coronary artery disease (10 men and 17 women; mean age 55 +/- 9 years), and in 21 healthy subjects (8 men and 13 women; mean age 47 +/- 11 years). In patients with syndrome X the slope of the regression line of heart rate versus time (heart rate/time slope) during exercise testing was similar to that of patients with coronary artery disease (3.3 +/- 0.8 versus 3.1 +/- 1.2 beats/min), but significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (4.2 +/- 1.1 beats/min; p less than 0.003). In patients with syndrome X the intercept of the heart rate/time slope was significantly higher than that in coronary artery disease patients and healthy subjects (102 +/- 15, 86 +/- 18, and 90 +/- 16 beats/min, respectively; p less than 0.015). Resting preexercise heart rate was also significantly higher in syndrome X, compared with coronary artery disease patients and healthy subjects (91 +/- 16, 79 +/- 16, and 80 +/- 14 beats/min, respectively). During ambulatory ECG monitoring, mean diurnal heart rate (from 6 AM to 6 PM) was higher in patients with syndrome X (83 +/- 8 beats/min) than in patients with coronary artery disease (75 +/- 8 beats/min) and healthy subjects (74 +/- 11 beats/min) (p less than 0.02). 
Human immunodeficiency virus infection among homeless men in a New York City shelter. Association with Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seroprevalence among a selected sample of 169 high-risk homeless men residing in a congregate shelter in New York City, NY, was 62%. Seropositivity for HIV correlated significantly with intravenous drug use (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 4.4) and active tuberculosis (odds ratio, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.4 to 13.5). Most cases of active tuberculosis were among homeless men with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex; and significant CD4 lymphocyte depletion was associated with active tuberculosis. Total time homeless correlated positively with active and latent tuberculosis infection. Compliance rates with return for HIV antibody test results, medications, and follow-up visits were 70%, suggesting a significant degree of knowledge, awareness, and personal concern regarding HIV infection among homeless men; yet 28% of homeless intravenous drug users continue active drug injection, despite HIV infection. Cohabitation in overcrowded congregate dormitories creates a risk of airborne transmission of tuberculosis, which is a common reactivation infection in HIV-seropositive homeless men. Medically appropriate housing should be provided to such homeless persons, and expanded HIV antibody testing, counseling, and medical services on site should be offered to residents of shelters. 
An eyelash nidus for dacryoliths of the lacrimal excretory and secretory systems. We treated two patients with dacryolithiasis secondary to an eyelash. The first patient underwent dacryocystorhinostomy for a stone within the lacrimal sac. In the second patient the dacryolith was removed from a lacrimal gland ductule. Eyelashes found in the tear film or conjunctival fornices during routine examination should be removed to prevent the possible occurrence of dacryolithiasis. 
Catecholamine responses to histamine infusion in man. To evaluate the effects of histamine-induced hypotension on plasma catecholamine levels, eight normal men, aged 20 to 40 years, were infused with incremental doses of histamine starting at 0.2 microgram/kg/min at a 30 degree tilt position with monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate. Histamine dosage was increased every 5 minutes by 0.1 to 0.2 microgram/kg/min until mean BP fell greater than 15 mm Hg or a dosage of 1.6 micrograms/kg/min was reached. Plasma catecholamine samples were taken between the fourth and fifth minute of each histamine dosage. Identical measurements were made during nitroglycerin-induced hypotension in these subjects. Histamine produced threefold greater increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels than did nitroglycerin for comparable decreases in BP. Although NE levels increased twofold to fivefold from baseline with histamine infusion, epinephrine levels increased minimally at the highest doses or not at all. Our data demonstrate that histamine selectively releases NE from adrenergic nerve terminals without significant adrenal catecholamine release. We suggest that neural NE release plays an important role in the cardiac effects of histamine. 
Radiotherapy of advanced laryngeal cancer using three small fractions daily. Since 1983, we have treated advanced (UICC stages III and IV) squamous carcinomas of the larynx by primary radiotherapy, using three small fractions a day, 3-4 h interfraction interval, 5 days per week. The early patients received doses per fraction of 1.5 Gy, and a total dose of approximately 70 Gy, given as a split-course over 6 to 7 weeks. While overall tumor control and laryngeal preservation was good, a number of severe late radiation reactions were seen. The schedule was then modified, with a reduction in the fraction size to 1.1 Gy, the total dose to 60 Gy, and the overall time to 4 weeks, with omission of the mid-treatment "split." Since 1986, we have treated 26 patients in this way. Acute reactions are brisk, but rapidly healing. Loco-regional control was achieved in 22 patients, only one of whom has relapsed to date, in a solitary node, salvaged by radical neck dissection. Four have died of uncontrolled loco-regional malignancy, and three of intercurrent disease while in clinical remission. No serious late morbidity has been observed in surviving patients, and vocal quality is good in the majority. These results suggest that this hyperfractionated and accelerated radiotherapy schedule may offer an acceptable nonsurgical, voice-preserving treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma; it can be used in a normally working radiotherapy department. 
Double-blind randomized multicenter study comparing Maalox TC tablets and ranitidine in healing of duodenal ulcers. The efficacy of ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and Maalox TC three tablets four times daily were compared in patients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer. Seventy-nine patients were randomly allocated to double-blind, double-dummy treatment, stratified for smokers. Endoscopy was repeated after four weeks. Those unhealed continued treatment for a further two weeks before final endoscopy. Per protocol analysis in 53 patients showed ulcer healing rates at week 4 and at weeks 4 and 6 combined of 78 and 89% on Maalox TC, and of 81 and 91% on ranitidine, respectively. The same analysis gave overall healing rates of 81% in smokers and 100% in nonsmokers, irrespective of treatment. Both treatments provided early ulcer pain relief. Diarrhea was a commoner side effect in patients on Maalox TC. The study showed Maalox TC and ranitidine were equally effective in healing duodenal ulceration. 
Multicenter trial of prophylaxis with clindamycin plus aztreonam or cefotaxime in gynecologic surgery. A prospective, randomized, multicenter study was conducted on the efficacy and safety of two prophylactic antibiotic regimens in both abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy. Patients received three intravenous doses of clindamycin (900 mg) plus either aztreonam (1 g) or cefotaxime (1 g); the doses were given at the induction of anesthesia and 8 and 16 hours later. A total of 170 patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and 142 patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy completed the trial and were evaluated. Following abdominal hysterectomy infections occurred at the operative site in 1.2% of patients given a regimen including aztreonam and in 4.7% of those given a regimen including cefotaxime; the difference between the two groups was not significant. Neither were significant differences observed in the incidence of fever, the incidence of bacteriuria, the need for postoperative antibiotics, or the duration of postoperative hospitalization, although results were slightly better for patients receiving clindamycin plus aztreonam. Following vaginal hysterectomy, slightly but not significantly better results for the same parameters were obtained in the group given clindamycin plus cefotaxime. Diarrhea was the only adverse reaction attributable to antibiotic treatment and occurred more frequently in patients given cefotaxime. It was concluded that the two regimens were similarly effective and safe in preventing infections following hysterectomy. 
Post-sclerotherapy bacterial peritonitis. Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy has been associated with a number of complications. Peritonitis after sclerotherapy has rarely been reported. In this retrospective review of 213 consecutive sclerotherapy procedures among 65 patients over a 3-yr period, we found that six cases of peritonitis occurred, for an incidence of approximately 3%. All patients developing post-sclerotherapy peritonitis had low ascitic fluid protein. However, this did not differ from patients who did not develop peritonitis. No patient on antibiotics at the time of sclerotherapy developed peritonitis. Peritonitis should be considered in the diagnosis of post-sclerotherapy fever. The role of prophylactic antibiotics to prevent this complication is uncertain. 
Renal atrophy or infarction in children with neuroblastoma. Twelve children with adrenal or upper abdominal paraaortic neuroblastoma developed unilateral or bilateral renal atrophy or infarction. At presentation, the children ranged in age from 2 weeks to 9.7 years. Neuroblastomas were stage II (n = 1), III (n = 2), IV-S (n = 2), and IV (n = 7). Treatment varied but included surgery, chemotherapy, localized abdominal irradiation, and/or bone marrow transplantation. Six children developed ipsilateral renal atrophy, five experienced ipsilateral or bilateral acute perioperative renal infarction, and one developed contralateral renal infarction unrelated to surgery. During treatment, two patients required hemodialysis; both subsequently died. Creatinine concentrations in eight patients have been in the normal range. Two patients have had mildly but persistently elevated creatinine levels. Renal damage from primary effects of the tumor can develop in children with adrenal or upper abdominal neuroblastoma. Treatment, especially surgical resection of the primary tumor, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, can compound such damage. 
Prognostic factors in childhood acute encephalitis. We have studied the prognostic factors in 462 children, from 1 month to 16 years old, with acute encephalitis. Death occurred in 2.8% patients, 6.7% were severely damaged and 90.5% were cured with no or only minor sequelae. The risk of death or severe damage in patients less than 1 year of age was 5.0-fold (95% confidence limits, 2.2 to 11.6; P less than 0.001) greater than that of older children. When compared with those children whose level of consciousness had been normal before admission, children who had been disoriented before admission had a 3.9-fold (1.1 to 14.3, P less than 0.05) risk and those who had been unconscious had a 25.4-fold (7.3 to 88.1, P less than 0.001) greater risk of death or severe damage. The risk of death or severe damage in patients with herpes simplex virus encephalitis was 11.7-fold (3.8 to 35.8, P less than 0.001) and in patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae encephalitis it was 7.0-fold (2.6 to 18.7, P less than 0.001) that of other children. All patients with none of the above mentioned risk factors were cured without any major sequelae. We conclude that specific attention should be paid to the youngest patients, especially to those with an impaired level of consciousness, and all available measures should be focused on early detection of herpes simplex virus or M. pneumoniae infection. 
Metastases of a gastric adenocarcinoma presenting as colonic polyposis. Report of a case. The authors report a case of multiple colonic metastases of a gastric signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, presenting as colonic polyposis revealed by diarrhea, iron deficiency anemia, and left supraclavicular lymph node. 
The induction and maintenance of central sensitization is dependent on N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor activation; implications for the treatment of post-injury pain hypersensitivity states. Repetitive stimulation of small diameter primary afferent fibres produces a progressive increase in action potential discharge (windup) and a prolonged increase in the excitability of neurones in the spinal cord following the stimulus. Previous studies have demonstrated that windup is the consequence of the temporal summation of slow synaptic potentials and that the slow potentials and windup are reduced by pretreatment with N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonists. We have now examined whether primary afferent induced hypersensitivity states in flexor motoneurones are also dependent on the activation of NMDA receptors and whether windup is a possible trigger for the production of the central hypersensitivity. Both a non-competitive (MK-801) and a competitive (D-CPP) NMDA antagonist, at doses that did not modify the baseline reflex, reduced the facilitation of the flexor reflex produced by either brief electrical stimulation of the sural nerve (1 Hz for 20 sec at C-fibre strength), or by the cutaneous application of the chemical irritant mustard oil. These antagonists also prevented windup from occurring in the motoneurones. When the the MK-801 and the D-CPP were administered once a state of central facilitation had been induced by prior treatment with mustard oil, they returned the facilitated reflex to its pretreatment level. These results indicate that NMDA receptors are involved in the induction and maintenance of the central sensitization produced by high threshold primary afferent inputs. Because central sensitization is likely to contribute to the post-injury pain hypersensitivity states in man, these data have a bearing both on the potential role of NMDA antagonists for pre-emptive analgesia and for treating established pain states. 
C terminus of the small GTP-binding protein smg p25A contains two geranylgeranylated cysteine residues and a methyl ester. smg p25A, also known as the rab3A protein, is a small GTP-binding protein that has been implicated in intracellular vesicle transport and the secretion of neurotransmitters. It has been shown to bind reversibly to membranes, though its cDNA-predicted sequence contains no obvious membrane-binding domains. However, smg p25A does contain a cDNA-predicted C-terminal Cys-Ala-Cys sequence at positions 218 through 220, which suggests that it may be posttranslationally modified. In the present study we used two different approaches to investigate this possibility. First, we incubated pheochromocytoma cells with [3H]mevalonolactone, examined the proteins that became labeled by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and demonstrated that two of these proteins exactly corresponded to smg p25A. Second, we purified smg p25A from bovine brain membranes and analyzed both the full-length protein and a proteolytically derived C-terminal peptide by a combination of high performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. This approach revealed that the protein's C-terminal region is methyl-esterified and contains two geranylgeranyl groups linked via thioether bonds to Cys-218 and Cys-220. Since smg p25A is one of several small GTP-binding proteins that share a C-terminal Cys-Xaa-Cys consensus sequence (where Xaa is an unspecified amino acid), our results suggest that these proteins may be similarly geranylgeranylated and methyl-esterified. 
Pericardial haemorrhage causing right atrial compression after cardiac surgery: role of transoesophageal echocardiography. After cardiac surgery transoesophageal echocardiography showed a large thrombus compressing the right atrium in three hypotensive patients. No satisfactory images were obtained by transthoracic imaging, which is often difficult in ventilated patients after cardiac surgery. Transoesophageal echocardiography, however, provided rapid diagnostic information and permitted prompt surgical intervention. 
Impact of diagnosis-related groups on the quality of postoperative care of patients with neck dissections. Two hundred eighty patients underwent neck dissection over a 10-year period: 138 during the 5-year period before the institution of Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) reimbursement and 142 during the 5 years after DRG regulations. A comparison of these two groups by site of tumor, stage of disease, histopathology, previous treatment, type of neck dissection, whether neck dissection was carried out alone or in combination with another procedure, presence of preexisting disease, postoperative complications, and mortality revealed no significant differences. A 35% reduction in the length of hospital stay from 16 to 10 days was identified in the post-DRG group with no detrimental effects on patient care. The variables found to have the greatest impact on length of hospital stay were the extent of operation and postoperative complications. 
Monomorphous histiocytoma in a child. Report of a case with ultrastructural features suggestive of dendritic cell differentiation. The authors describe a rapidly growing soft tissue tumor of predominantly histiocytic composition in an 8-year-old child. The tumor cells were identified as elements of the mononuclear phagocyte system by histologic, histochemical, immunologic, and electron microscopic study. Despite the presence of a minor fibroblastic component, the tumor did not conform to established criteria for a diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. Formation of frequent desmosome-like intercellular junctions raised the possibility of dendritic reticulum cell differentiation, since the latter cells seem to be the only elements of the mononuclear phagocyte system that display such specialized cell junctions. The results of immunostaining were discrepant with those reported for normal dendritic reticulum cells, but the currently available information makes it doubtful that the entire neoplastic spectrum of dendritic cell differentiation can currently be diagnosed in surgical pathology. 
Effects of a meal on hemodynamic function at rest and during exercise in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy experience postprandial exacerbation of their symptoms. The vasodilation associated with eating may be deleterious in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, especially during exercise. To examine the hemodynamic effects of a meal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 11 patients were studied with invasive hemodynamic monitoring during exercise testing in the fasting state and 45 min after a 740 kcal (3,100 J) meal. The meal induced a decrease in systemic vascular resistance index at rest (mean +/- SD, -17 +/- 14%), increases in mean right atrial (31 +/- 21%), mean pulmonary artery (14 +/- 14%) and mean pulmonary capillary wedge (17 +/- 14%) pressures and an increase in cardiac index (18 +/- 10%) due to an increased heart rate without any significant change in stroke volume. During postprandial exercise, heart rate, rate-pressure product, cardiac index and cardiac filling pressures were higher than during fasting exercise and one patient had a decrease in exercise blood pressure compared with the fasting test. Five patients with postprandial exacerbation of symptoms in everyday life had a lesser increase in systemic arterial pressure and stroke volume during both exercise tests and a smaller increase in cardiac index after the meal than did the six patients without postprandial symptom exacerbation, suggesting more severe cardiac disease. It is concluded that patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have an abnormal hemodynamic response to food, in which stroke volume fails to increase and pulmonary capillary wedge and pulmonary artery pressures increase. These adverse changes persist during postprandial exercise and may predispose to exertional collapse in certain patients. 
Optimum concentration of bupivacaine for combined caudal--general anesthesia in children. Caudal epidural anesthesia has become widely accepted as a means of providing postoperative pain relief and intraoperative supplementation to general anesthesia for children. To determine the best concentration of bupivacaine for combined general-caudal anesthesia in children, 122 children aged 1-8 yr scheduled for outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy were randomized to receive, in a double-blind fashion, caudal anesthesia with bupivacaine in one of six concentrations (0.125, 0.15, 0.175, 0.2, 0.225, or 0.25%). After incision, a programmed reduction in inspired halothane resulted, if tolerated by the subject, in an inspired halothane concentration of 0.5% 10 min after incision. End-tidal halothane concentration at hernia sac ligation for subjects receiving 0.175% bupivacaine (0.55 +/- 0.03%) was less than that for subjects receiving 0.15% bupivacaine (0.75 +/- 0.05%; P less than 0.05). Subjects receiving 0.175% bupivacaine also were discharged earlier from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (27 +/- 1 min) than were subjects receiving 0.15% bupivacaine (38 +/- 5 min; P = 0.05). Children receiving greater than or equal to 0.2% bupivacaine tended to complain more of leg weakness after surgery; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (39 of 67 vs. 16 of 47; P = 0.057). The incidence of complaints of leg weakness and paresthesia was positively correlated with bupivacaine concentration (r = 0.706; P = 0.05). Subjects receiving 0.125% bupivacaine had higher pain scores on arrival to the PACU than did those receiving 0.2% bupivacaine (P = 0.05); there were no other differences in pain scores. 
Functional and urodynamic characteristics of bladder substitution with detubularised right colonic segment. A total of 19 patients underwent bladder replacement with a detubularised right colonic segment; 14 males underwent complete substitution after cystoprostatectomy and 5 females had augmentation after subtotal cystectomy. The mean follow-up time was 20 months. Urodynamic evaluation showed a low pressure reservoir with a mean capacity of 580 ml and normal closure pressure. Sensitivity of the bladder to cold was normal in the augmentation group but was lacking in all patients in the total substitution group. In all except 1 patient the neobladder emptied effectively upon straining without significant residual urine. Seventeen patients were completely continent by day and 10 by night; 1 patient developed hyperchloraemic acidosis requiring treatment. Bladder substitution is superior to the standard ileal or colonic conduits with regard to quality of life, and the use of a right colonic segment is functionally comparable with neobladders composed of the ileum or a combination of the right colon and ileum. The latter are more difficult to fabricate and so may have more complications. 
Effect of cisapride on delayed gastric emptying in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Some patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease have delayed gastric emptying. This study investigates the effect of cisapride on gastric emptying in 34 patients with proved reflux and delayed gastric emptying of solids. They were enrolled in a double blind controlled crossover study. Placebo or cisapride (10 mg) tablets were given three times a day for three days followed by further assessment of gastric emptying. The protocol was repeated with the crossover tablet. Gastric emptying was assessed by a dual radionuclide technique. The percentage of a solid meal remaining in the stomach at 100 minutes (% R100 minutes) and the time taken for 50% of the liquid to empty (T50 minutes) were calculated and analysed by the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed ranks test and expressed as medians (ranges). For gastric emptying of solids the initial % R100 minutes (70 (60-100)%) was not significantly different from placebo (71 (35-100)%). After cisapride treatment a significant acceleration (p less than 0.001) in gastric emptying occurred (% R100 minutes, 50.5 (28-93)%). Similarly with gastric emptying of liquids, the initial T50 minute value was 26.5 (12-82) minutes, after placebo the value was 28 (11-81) minutes, but this was significantly accelerated with cisapride (p less than 0.03) to 22.5 (6-61) minutes. The acceleration in gastric emptying occurred in the proximal portion of the stomach for gastric emptying of both solids and liquids suggesting that this is the principal site of action of cisapride. We conclude that cisapride significantly accelerates gastric emptying of both solids and liquids in patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and delayed gastric emptying. 
Myelin splitting in the spongy lesion in Leigh encephalopathy. A spongy lesion consists of numerous vacuoles, mainly in the central gray matter, and is a characteristic finding in subacute necrotizing encephalopathy (Leigh encephalopathy); the cause of this lesion is unknown. An ultrastructural study on the vacuolated lesions in the left putamen of a patient with subacute necrotizing encephalopathy due to a deficiency of mitochondrial enzyme complexes I and IV revealed that the vacuoles were formed through the splitting of myelin. Because myelin splitting is commonly caused by toxic or metabolic diseases in humans and experimental animals, we believe that the vacuolation was due to the splitting of myelin which was caused by abnormal mitochondrial metabolism, even though this lesion is most commonly found in the white matter. We do not know whether the spongy lesion is formed only through myelin splitting in patients with subacute necrotizing encephalopathy; however, myelin splitting must play an important role in the formation of the spongy lesion. 
Depression and fatigue in the primary care physician. Fatigue is a symptom that is found in a variety of psychiatric disorders. The nature of a physician's life may foster such symptoms that can be either a reaction to work or a sign of an emotional disorder. This article summarizes various developmental stages that can lead to such problems. These difficulties may also be found in the physician's family and can be easily overlooked. 
Prolonged QT interval and risk of sudden death in South-East Asian men. Sudden death in sleep occurs in substantial numbers among young men in South-East Asia. The frequencies of electrocardiographic abnormalities were measured in groups with varying risks of such sudden death. The mean heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater among 123 Laotian refugees in Thailand at high risk (405 [95% confidence interval 397-413] ms) than in 77 Laotian refugees in the United States at lower risk (364 [359-369] ms) and 199 non-Asian US residents at negligible risk (358 [354-362] ms). Among refugees in Thailand, prolonged QTc interval was associated with poor thiamine status and a history of seizure-like episodes in sleep. Thiamine deficiency may be a cause of prolonged QT interval and sudden death in this region. 
MR imaging in hydatid disease. Hydatid cysts may develop anywhere in the body as a result of the presence of a viable parasite (Echinococcus granulosus). Depending on the condition of the parasite, the host reaction, and therapy, the hydatid cyst will degenerate and may eventually collapse, leaving an area of calcification in the host tissue. The purpose of this pictorial essay is to demonstrate the use of MR imaging in the diagnosis of the various stages of hydatid disease and in monitoring response to therapy. 
Nucleokinesis: distinct pattern of cell translocation in response to an autocrine motility factor-like substance or fibronectin [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Aug 15;88(16):7456] Human lung adenocarcinoma cells develop bipolar shape with prominent pseudopodia (greater than or equal to 200 microns) when cultured in the presence of autocrine motility factor (AMF)-like substance or on fibronectin-coated substrata. AMF was partially purified from a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line and has a peak biological activity at a molecular mass of 67 kDa. Using time-lapse photography, we observed that during AMF- or fibronectin-induced cell translocation, the nuclei of some bipolar cells are transported to the opposite end of the cell, while gross cell shape and position remain unchanged. Following this nuclear movement, which we call "nucleokinesis," the posterior pseudopodium is retracted behind the nucleus. Thus, extension of a pseudopodium followed by nucleokinesis in the same direction and retraction of the cell body behind the nucleus is a normal motile sequence in translocating bipolar cells. This suggests that nucleokinesis is a distinct step in whole-cell translocation of bipolar cells on biological substrata and that pseudopodia can be used as nuclear transport organs. In contrast, adenocarcinoma cells cultured on artificial substrata and in the absence of AMF display a fibroblast-like motility pattern with the nucleus centrally located within the migrating cell. 
Clinical and electrodiagnostic features of X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy. We describe four men from two kinships affected with X-linked recessive bulbospinal neuronopathy, and one sporadic case. All developed postural tremor, weakness, and fasciculations, with onset from age 25 to 39 years. Weakness began in the pelvic girdle or hands, with dysphagia or dysarthria occurring years later in two. Sensory symptoms were present in only one, who also had diabetes mellitus. In contrast, sural nerve action potentials were small or absent in all. Needle EMG showed widespread chronic partial denervation with reinnervation. The characteristic twitching of the chin produced by pursing of the lips consisted of repetitive or grouped motor unit discharges, rather than fasciculations. Broader awareness of the distinctive features of bulbospinal neuronopathy will probably increase the frequency of its recognition. Diagnosis is important for purposes of providing a prognosis for affected men and genetic counseling for affected families. 
Use of albumin as a volume expander. In some hospitals, albumin products account for 10% of the pharmaceutical budget. As much as 60% of these prescriptions are empiric, and from 40 to 70% of albumin that is administered is given for inappropriate reasons. Although the reasons for albumin administration vary, prevention or reversal of hypovolemia is part of the reason in the majority of cases. 
Venous obstruction: an analysis of one hundred thirty-seven cases with hemodynamic, venographic, and clinical correlations. One hundred thirty-seven limbs with venous obstruction were analyzed. The arm/foot venous pressure differential and reactive hyperemia tests were found to be useful techniques to diagnose and grade venous obstruction. Traditional techniques including venography and ambulatory venous pressure are inferior in this regard. The newer techniques have provided newer insights in venous obstruction which are detailed herein. The hand-held Doppler was surprisingly very sensitive in grade I as well as in more severe forms of obstruction. Neither anatomic locale of obstruction nor its extent determined hemodynamic severity. Extensive proximal lesions could be hemodynamically mild, and conversely distal crural obstructions and single segment lesions could be hemodynamically severe. Phlebographic appearance was a poor index of collateralization. The paradoxical venous pressure response to the reactive hyperemia test in grade IV obstruction was found to be due to suppression or delay of the reactive hyperemia response itself in the presence of severe venous obstruction. The pain of venous claudication may be related to this phenomenon. Skin ulceration in the presence of venous obstruction was related to the associated reflux rather than the hemodynamic severity of the obstruction itself. The Linton procedure was found to be useful in treating such skin ulcerations. After perforator disruption, obstruction did not become hemodynamically worse, but reflux as measured by the Valsalva test improved with ulcer healing. The improvement in reflux related to Valsalva offers for the first time a hemodynamic rationale for the Linton procedure. 
Epidemiology of acute respiratory infections in children of developing countries. Acute respiratory infections cause four and a half million deaths among children every year, the overwhelming majority occurring in developing countries. Pneumonia unassociated with measles causes 70% of these deaths; post-measles pneumonia, 15%; pertussis, 10%; and bronchiolitis and croup syndromes, 5%. Both bacterial and viral pathogens are responsible for these deaths. The most important bacterial agents are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The data on bacterial etiology of pneumonia during the first 3 months of life are limited, and almost no information on the role of chlamydia and pertussis in this age period is available. The distribution of viral pathogens in developing countries can be summarized as follows: respiratory syncytial virus, 15%-20%; parainfluenza viruses, 7%-10%; and influenza A and B viruses and adenovirus, 2%-4%. Mixed viral and bacterial infections occur frequently. Risk factors that increase the incidence and severity of lower respiratory infection in developing countries include large family size, lateness in the birth order, crowding, low birth weight, malnutrition, vitamin A deficiency, lack of breast feeding, pollution, and young age. Effective interventions for prevention and medical case management are urgently needed to save the lives of many children predisposed to severe disease. 
Prevention of anastomosis leakage: an artificial connective tissue. Anastomosis leakage still causes considerable morbidity and mortality after digestive tract surgery. We report here our experience of the use of reconstituted connective tissue created from elastin, fibronectin and collagen in preventing anastomosis leakage and closing intestinal fistulas. In animal studies (56 rats), this connective tissue was used as a patch applied with fibrin sealant to the edges of a 1 cm diameter colonic defect. In a clinical evaluation, eight patients had an intestinal fistula closed by a simple sewn suture reinforced by a sealed patch and seven patients had a high risk anastomosis reinforced by a sealed patch, in most cases as an alternative to staged surgery. In animal studies, complete reconstitution of the three colonic layers was obtained without retraction and without inflammatory reaction within 40 days, while the patch was slowly resorbed. In clinical trials all 15 defects and anastomoses healed without complication. Three patients died from other causes and, at autopsy, the patch was found to have remained in place covering the suture line. If these results are confirmed by a prospective clinical trial, such biomaterial offers the possibility of reducing the occurrence of anastomosis leakage, especially in high risk circumstances. 
Elective versus emergency cesarean hysterectomy cases in a residency program setting: a review of 129 cases from 1984 to 1988. A retrospective study was performed to compare elective versus emergency cesarean hysterectomy in a residency program. We noted the following statistically significant differences between emergency and elective cases: (1) Estimated blood loss (mean +/- SD) for emergency and elective cases was significantly different at 1495 +/- 772 and 875 +/- 396 ml (p = 0.001). (2) Operative time in emergency cases was significantly longer than in elective cases (105 +/- 38 vs 83 +/- 27 minutes, p = 0.003). (3) The incidence of transfusion was 68% in our emergency cases and 14.6% in the elective series (p less than 0.05). (4) Febrile morbidity in our series was 40% in emergency cases and 18.3% in elective cases (p less than 0.05). Our series was comparable to previous series reported. Our experience suggests that cesarean hysterectomy can be performed safely in a residency training program when done as an elective procedure in the well-prepared patient. 
Cardiovascular effects of volatile anesthesia in rabbits: influence of chronic heart failure and enalaprilat treatment. Circulatory responses to isoflurane and halothane anesthesia were studied in eight rabbits with biventricular cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (Adriamycin, 14 mg/kg IV over 7 wk) and in eight controls (saline injections). In preliminary operations pulsed-Doppler flow probes were placed on the ascending aorta, left renal artery, and lower abdominal aorta. Each group was studied after 4, 6, and 7 wk of treatment. The development of congestive heart failure (CHF) was associated with decreases in mean arterial pressure and cardiac output (CO) of 14% and 16%, respectively, (P less than 0.05) and an increase in heart rate. In controls, each anesthetic agent produced dose-related decreases in mean arterial pressure and increases in heart rate, but not significant changes in CO. Renal blood flow was reduced to a similar degree by 1.3 MAC halothane (24% decrease) and 1.3 MAC isoflurane (21% decrease); hindlimb blood flow was reduced only by halothane. As CHF developed there was an attenuation of the heart rate response to anesthesia. Halothane, but not isoflurane, significantly reduced CO in more advanced stages of CHF. The changes in renal blood flow and hindlimb blood flow with each anesthetic in the CHF group were similar to those observed in controls and did not vary with week of treatment. Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (0.2 mg/kg IV) reversed the CO and renal blood flow effects of halothane except after 7 wk of treatment in the CHF group, when the combination of halothane and enalaprilat resulted in severe circulatory depression. 
Dilatation of ascending aorta in patients with repaired coarctation. The long-term outcome following repair of typical aortic coarctation in adulthood may be complicated by disorders of the ascending aorta. Follow-up averaging 15 years revealed a 3.8% incidence of dilatation of the ascending aorta after such late repair. Hypertension and concomitant aortic valvular disease were common in these patients. Aortic dilatation can appear years after coarctation repair, irrespective of the operative technique and its success, and can lead to death from aortic dissection or rupture of an aortic aneurysm. Careful follow-up after coarctation repair in adulthood is advisable to detect late aortic complications. 
Multicenter study of superficial bladder cancer treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin or adriamycin. Results of long-term follow-up. We evaluated 158 cases of patients with superficial bladder cancers (Stages Ta, T1, and Tis). These cases were treated with either intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Tice strain) or Adriamycin (ADR), in a multicenter, nonrandomized study. One hundred thirty-one of these patients were followed up; the results continue to show a higher percentage of initial complete remissions with BCG (68%) than with ADR (57%). With additional therapy, both BCG and ADR achieved complete remission in 83 percent of the patients. When 7 failures with patients taking ADR were switched to BCG and the disease cleared, the rate of complete remission for BCG rose to 85 percent. The recurrence rate per 100 patient-months was only slightly different for BCG (0.9) and ADR (0.8). The percentage of progressions continued to be higher for BCG (8%) than for ADR (5%). Cystectomies were performed in 2.5 percent of the BCG patients. Using the Cox regression model with covariates, we found drug treatment, tumor grade, and sex to be statistically significant in determining failures throughout the protocol. Although both BCG and ADR were effective over the course of the study, BCG is the drug of choice for residual tumor (Stages T1 and Tis). 
Chronic morphine therapy for cancer pain: plasma and cerebrospinal fluid morphine and morphine-6-glucuronide concentrations. Morphine-6-glucuronide (M-6-G) is an active metabolite that may contribute to the clinical effects produced by systemic administration of morphine. To help clarify the extent to which M-6-G may cross the blood-brain barrier and exert effects, we employed high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection to measure the concentrations of M-6-G and morphine in the plasma and either ventricular (three patients) or lumbar (eight patients) CSF of cancer patients receiving chronic morphine therapy. The mean ratio of morphine in ventricular CSF:morphine in plasma was 0.71; the same ratio for M-6-G was only 0.077. The average molar ratio of M-6-G: morphine in ventricular CSF was 0.207, and the average molar ratio in plasma was 1.89. Although sampling problems render the lumbar CSF results less reliable, they were very similar. Thus, plasma contained approximately twice as much M-6-G as morphine, whereas CSF contained only one-fifth to one-third as much. These data confirm that M-6-G in plasma is distributed into CSF, but to a far lesser extent than morphine. They help explain animal data demonstrating much higher potency of M-6-G on administration into CSF than systemic administration and indicate that the degree to which M-6-G contributes to morphine effects in humans remains an unresolved question. 
Ascitic fluid pH and lactate: insensitive and nonspecific tests in detecting ascitic fluid infection. Ascitic fluid pH and lactate concentration have been proposed as useful tests for the detection of ascitic fluid infection. However, past studies involved small numbers of infected patients, and all did not use optimal culture techniques. This large study was performed using highly sensitive culture methods and sought (a) to compare the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of pH and lactate to that of the ascitic fluid neutrophil count and (b) to determine whether evaluation of ascitic fluid pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid pH or lactate gradient) would result in improved decision-making regarding empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Analysis of 206 ascitic fluid specimens obtained in 175 patients, including 101 infected specimens, revealed that ascitic fluid (or arterial-ascitic fluid) pH and lactate were less than 50% sensitive in detecting bacterial peritonitis and that these tests did not improve clinical decision-making about empirical treatment of suspected ascitic fluid infection. Although statistically significant differences in ascitic fluid pH were detected between infected samples and control samples, these differences did not appear to be clinically helpful. The ascitic fluid pH was 0% sensitive in detecting the presence of bacteria in the absence of neutrophils (i.e., no such specimens had a pH lower than 7.35). Ascitic fluid pH correlated well with neutrophil count and appears to be, at least in part, an indirect measure of the presence of neutrophils in ascitic fluid. Measurement of pH or lactate (or arterial-ascitic fluid gradients) is not helpful in the clinical management of infected ascitic fluid. 
Klinefelter's syndrome and liver adenoma. We describe the occurrence of a liver adenoma in a young patient with Klinefelter's syndrome, diagnosed by classic 47,XXY karyotype in all investigated cells and a sex hormone imbalance. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such an association, which might suggest a simple coincidence. However, a pathogenetic link between Klinefelter's syndrome and liver adenoma can be suggested in view of the following facts: Liver adenoma mostly affects women of child-bearing age using oral contraceptives. It is very rare in men, and affected men frequently have been treated with androgens. Both groups are characterized by a sex hormone imbalance. Also, the risk of breast cancer, another hormone-sensitive tumor, is greatly elevated in men with Klinefelter's syndrome, possibly due to sex hormone imbalance. 
Heart rate response during exercise testing and ambulatory ECG monitoring in patients with syndrome X. The response of the heart rate during exercise testing and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring performed with patients not receiving antianginal treatment was assessed in 26 patients (9 men and 17 women; mean age 51 +/- 8 years) with syndrome X (angina pectoris with normal coronary arteries), in 27 patients with coronary artery disease (10 men and 17 women; mean age 55 +/- 9 years), and in 21 healthy subjects (8 men and 13 women; mean age 47 +/- 11 years). In patients with syndrome X the slope of the regression line of heart rate versus time (heart rate/time slope) during exercise testing was similar to that of patients with coronary artery disease (3.3 +/- 0.8 versus 3.1 +/- 1.2 beats/min), but significantly lower than that in healthy subjects (4.2 +/- 1.1 beats/min; p less than 0.003). In patients with syndrome X the intercept of the heart rate/time slope was significantly higher than that in coronary artery disease patients and healthy subjects (102 +/- 15, 86 +/- 18, and 90 +/- 16 beats/min, respectively; p less than 0.015). Resting preexercise heart rate was also significantly higher in syndrome X, compared with coronary artery disease patients and healthy subjects (91 +/- 16, 79 +/- 16, and 80 +/- 14 beats/min, respectively). During ambulatory ECG monitoring, mean diurnal heart rate (from 6 AM to 6 PM) was higher in patients with syndrome X (83 +/- 8 beats/min) than in patients with coronary artery disease (75 +/- 8 beats/min) and healthy subjects (74 +/- 11 beats/min) (p less than 0.02). 
Association of immunoreactive eosinophil major basic protein with placental septa and cysts. A protein that is immunochemically indistinguishable from the major basic protein of the eosinophil granule is present at elevated concentrations in the plasma of pregnant women. Major basic protein has been localized to placental trophoblasts known as X cells. Because X cells are located in placental septa and septal cysts, we tested whether the numbers of these structures are correlated with plasma levels of major basic protein. Data analysis revealed strong positive correlations between maternal plasma major basic protein concentrations and the number of placental septa, septal cysts, and subchorial cysts and the presence of subchorial fibrin deposits. No significant correlation was found between plasma major basic protein levels and other variables examined, such as placental weight. Thus major basic protein is a specific marker for septa and cysts, presumably because it is an X-cell product. The study of major basic protein may aid in delineating the function and ontogeny of X cells, as well as their role in fibrin deposition and in septa and cyst formation.
