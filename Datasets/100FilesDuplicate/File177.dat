Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis: a report of two severe cases. Two unrelated children with a severe form of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis are described. In addition to painful flexion contractures of all of the large joints, oral and skin lesions, and typical radiologic appearance of osteolytic defects, both girls had marked growth retardation and recurrent infections. Both children died in early infancy of overwhelming infection. 
The erythrocyte-type glucose transporter in blood vessels of primary and metastatic brain tumors. We previously demonstrated that brain microvessels have a high density of the erythrocyte-type glucose transporter and suggested this could be used as a marker of cells with "occluding" junctions. Now, we have studied by immunocytochemistry the tissue distribution of the glucose transporter in a variety of primary and metastatic human brain tumors with a monoclonal antibody to the glucose transporter of human erythrocytes. Microvessels in normal brain tissue distant from the tumor, and in brain surrounding the tumor, immunostained strongly for the glucose transporter. Microvessels in primary and metastatic tumors, however, lacked glucose transporter immunoreactivity. Only in the relatively benign juvenile cerebellar astrocytomas was glucose transporter immunoreactivity retained in some of the tumor microvessels. Because a high glucose transporter density is a marker of vessels with barrier properties, our results indicate that the vast majority of brain tumor microvessels do nc, have an intact blood-brain barrier. 
Necrotizing myopathy with pipestem capillaries, microvascular deposition of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC), and minimal cellular infiltration. Three adult patients, two with undifferentiated connective tissue disease and one with carcinoma, had a distinctive pathologic reaction pattern consisting of necrotizing myopathy, minimal cellular infiltration, and a microangiopathy with thick "pipestem" vessels and microvascular deposits of complement membrane attack complex. Quantitative analysis revealed focal capillary depletion. This pattern represents an immune-mediated microangiopathy and is distinct from that observed in other inflammatory myopathies. 
Primary meningeal B lymphoma presenting as a subacute ascending polyradiculoneuropathy. A subacute ascending polyradiculoneuropathy was the main feature of a primary meningeal B lymphoma in two patients. Tumour cells appeared in the CSF eight and six months respectively after the onset of the disease. Treatment by intrathecal methotrexate resulted in transient improvement. 
Stripping out pus in lactational mastitis: a means of preventing breast abscess. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether manual stripping of pus from the breasts of women with lactational mastitis is effective in preventing the formation of breast abscesses. DESIGN: Case series (chart review). SETTING: Family practice in Montreal. PATIENTS: All (475) charts of patients with lactational mastitis were reviewed; 61 women were excluded because they already had a breast abscess. Most of the patients had been referred. OUTCOME MEASURES: Abscess formation, length of illness after treatment, rate of recurrence of mastitis, illness in the mother or infant within the 6 weeks after the mastitis and continuance of breast-feeding. MAIN RESULTS: The duration of symptoms before treatment was 1 to 56 (mean 5.3) days. In 9% of the cases both breasts were affected, and in 23% at least one episode of mastitis had previously occurred. The stripping technique was applied to all the patients. Pus was removed in 210 women; the remaining women were considered to have cellulitis. Only four patients (less than 1%) had breast abscesses. The mean length of illness after treatment was 7.2 days. The rate of recurrence was 14%. In all, 6% of the mothers and 9% of the infants became ill in the 6 weeks after the mastitis. Most (92%) of the patients continued to breast-feed. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of abscess formation was considerably lower than the rates reported in the literature. Therefore, manual stripping of pus from the infected breasts of lactating women appears to be effective in preventing breast abscesses. 
Familial enteric neuropathy with pseudoobstruction. We report a case of autosomal dominant chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction secondary to a familial enteric neuropathy. Esophagogastrointestinal manometry studies in the index case showed decreased postprandial contractile frequency with normal amplitude of pressure activity in the stomach and small bowel. Pupillary function and autonomic reflexes were all normal, excluding an extrinsic autonomic neuropathy of the viscera. Histologic examination of the small intestine by hematoxylin and eosin stains revealed normal smooth muscles but a reduced number of neurons in the myenteric plexus without inflammatory cells or neuroNal intranuclear inclusions. Histologic examination of the myenteric plexus using the sections taken along the longitudinal axis of the intestine, stained with silver by the Smith technique, disclosed decreased numbers of argyrophilic neurons and degeneration of neurons and axons; however, there was no reactive increase in the number of glial cell nuclei. The patient's mother had suffered from chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction, which did not abate following extensive small bowel resection. This is the third family reported with an autosomal dominant enteric neuropathy unassociated with evidence of extrinsic autonomic or peripheral neuropathy. Subtotal resection of the small bowel was followed by recurrence of the pseudoobstruction syndrome in both affected members of the family. 
Negative inotropic activity of the calcium antagonists isradipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil in diseased human myocardium. The use of calcium antagonists in the treatment of cardiac failure is limited by the negative inotropic effects they exert. The comparative inotropic activity of four calcium antagonists was therefore investigated, using electrically driven human papillary muscle strips and human atrial trabeculae. These inotropic effects were studied with cumulative concentration-response curves. The four calcium antagonists included in this study were all found to significantly (P less than or equal to .05) diminish the force of contraction above 0.01 mumol/L, but with different potencies. On the basis of the relationship between therapeutic vasoactive plasma concentrations and the negative inotropic effective concentrations in our system in vitro, the ranking order of potential negative inotropism in the treatment of cardiac failure with calcium antagonists was verapamil greater than nifedipine greater than diltiazem greater than isradipine. Thus, to minimize cardiodepressant risk, the use of calcium antagonists with weak negative inotropic effects at relevant concentrations should be preferred, especially in the case of patients with compromised cardiac function. 
Cholesterol: a useful parameter for distinguishing between pleural exudates and transudates. Previously established criteria were used to classify 253 pleural effusions as transudates (65 cases), neoplastic exudates (67 cases), tuberculous exudates (65 cases), or miscellaneous exudate (56 cases). The parameters pleural LDH (PLDH), pleural LDH/serum LDH ratio (P/SLDH), and pleural protein/serum protein ratio (P/SPROT) were compared with pleural cholesterol (PCHOL) and the pleural cholesterol/serum cholesterol ratio (P/SCHOL) with regard to their usefulness for distinguishing between pleural exudates and transudates. The PCHOL values determined were 28.5 +/- 12.8 mg/dl for transudates, 88.1 +/- 30 mg/dl for neoplastic exudates, 96.5 +/- 28 mg/dl for tuberculous exudates, and 88 +/- 35.9 mg/dl for the miscellaneous group; the differences between the transudate group and the others are statistically significant (p less than 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity of P/SPROT for diagnosis of exudates were both 89 percent; the sensitivity of PLDH was 67 percent and its specificity was 95 percent; the sensitivity and specificity of P/SLDH were both 84.6 percent. Using Light's three criteria as a battery, the sensitivity was 94.6 percent and its specificity was 78.4 percent. All the transudates and 17 (9 percent) of the 188 exudates had PCHOL values below 55 mg/dl, so that with this threshold, PCHOL had a sensitivity of 91 percent and a specificity of 100 percent for diagnosis of exudates. With a threshold of 0.3, P/SCHOL had a sensitivity of 92.5 percent and a specificity of 87.6 percent. The number of misclassifications by PCHOL was less than with any other of the parameters, with statistically significant differences with respect to PLDH (p less than 0.001) and P/SLDH (p less than 0.01). We conclude that determination of PCHOL and P/SCHOL is of great value for distinguishing between pleural exudates and transudates, and should be included in routine laboratory analysis of pleural effusions. 
Pathogenetic mechanism of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: follow-up of stroke patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Stroke patients with brain infarction and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF, n = 88) or sinus rhythm (SR, n = 188), treated at a population-based stroke unit, were studied for 5 years. Within 1 month, 13% of NVAF and 2% of SR patients (P less than 0.01) had either a stroke recurrence or systemic embolism. After 5 years, the corresponding figures were 26 and 25%, respectively. The 1-month and 5-year mortality values were 35 and 78% in the NVAF group vs. 7 and 52% in the SR group (P less than 0.01). Age, ischaemic heart disease and function group on arrival at the hospital were independent risk factors for death. The main cause of death was ischaemic heart disease in the NVAF group, and complications to the initial stroke or a stroke recurrence in the SR group. Thus a higher risk of death, stroke recurrence and peripheral embolism was evident only during the first month after stroke. 
Mefloquine-resistant falciparum malaria on the Thai-Burmese border Mefloquine is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated multiresistant falciparum malaria, and in combination with sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine (MSP) at a single dose of 15/30/1.5 mg/kg, respectively, has been used in Thailand for the past 6 years. In 1985-86, MSP cured over 98% of 5192 patients with falciparum malaria on the Thai-Burmese border. 4 years later we studied the efficacy of MSP in 395 patients at the same location. The cure rate at 28 days was 70.8% (95% Cl 67-77.2%). The proportion of early treatment failures (in whom parasitaemia did not clear) had risen from 0.27 to 3.7% (p less than 0.0001). Failure rates were 50% in children under 6 years old, 29% in the 6-15 age group, and 19% in adults (p less than 0.001). Patients with early treatment failure were retreated with 25 mg/kg mefloquine, but 27% had a further recrudescence of infection within 28 days. The mean (95% Cl) serum mefloquine concentration at the time of first recrudescence was 638 (546-730) ng/ml, a value previously associated with successful treatment. Mefloquine concentrations were no lower in those with recrudescent infections than in age-matched successfully treated patients, suggesting that pharmacokinetic factors were not responsible for the high treatment-failure rate. Plasmodium falciparum has developed resistance to mefloquine rapidly, despite the addition of sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine and strict control of drug administration. The MSP combination should now be abandoned. 
DNA damage in cultured human skin fibroblasts exposed to excimer laser radiation. Ultraviolet excimer lasers are being considered for use in a variety of refractive and therapeutic procedures, the long-term biologic consequences of which are unknown. The effect of sublethal doses of 193-nm laser radiation on cellular DNA was examined in cultured human skin fibroblasts. In contrast to 248 nm, treatments with the 193-nm laser radiation below 70 J/m2 did not cause significant pyrimidine dimer formation in the skin cells. This was indicated by the lack of excision repair activities (unscheduled DNA synthesis assay), and further demonstrated by direct analysis of pyrimidine dimers in DNA from irradiated cells. However, a low level of unscheduled DNA synthesis could be detected following irradiation at 193 nm with 70 J/m2. Both the 193-nm and 248-nm radiation were able to induce chromosomal aberrations, as indicated by a micronucleus assay. A dose-dependent increase in micronuclei frequency was observed 48 and 72 h after laser irradiation. These results indicate that exposure of actively replicating human skin fibroblasts to sublethal doses of either 193- or 248-nm laser radiation can result in genotoxicity. 
Alcohol craving in rehabilitation: assessment of nutrition therapy. If untreated, alcohol abuse, which often results from alcohol craving, causes major metabolic abnormalities, altered life-styles, lost productivity, and eventually death. Biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to alcohol craving include the stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, the endogenous opiate beta-endorphin system, neurotransmitter synthesis and release, hypoglycemia, and nutrient deficiencies. The macronutrient ratio of meals, the resulting insulin response, and nutrient blood levels can affect amino acid and nutrient transport across the blood-brain barrier. Researchers have reported that animals increase alcohol intake when fed nutrient-deficient diets or after stressful experience. A pilot study was designed to assess the effects of nutrition therapy added to a traditional rehabilitation program based on the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous. One study group received traditional therapy; the other study group received traditional therapy and nutrition therapy consisting of modified menus and individualized nutrition counseling. Patients who received nutrition therapy reported significantly fewer hypoglycemic symptoms, lower sugar intake, less alcohol craving as well as significantly greater nutrient intakes; a greater number abstained from alcohol. These findings indicate that nutrition therapy can aid in the recovery from alcoholism. 
Successful combined operation for Takayasu's arteritis. We report a case of Takayasu's arteritis complicated with aortic regurgitation and severe stenosis of the left coronary ostium and the innominate artery. Simultaneous surgical treatment of aortic valve replacement, coronary ostium endarterectomy, and aortosubclavian artery bypass using saphenous vein were performed. We discuss the choice of simultaneous operation and the option of surgical treatment for coronary ostium lesion due to Takayasu's arteritis. 
Health implications of obesity in American Indians and Alaska Natives. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are experiencing an epidemic of diabetes, increasing rates of coronary artery disease and hypertension, and poor survival rates for breast cancer that are likely partially attributable to the increasing prevalence of obesity over the past generation. Obesity may also contribute to the high rates of gallstones and to adverse outcomes of pregnancy in AI/ANs. Although overall mortality was not associated with obesity in Pima Indians (except in the most obese men), the relationship of obesity to longevity in other AI/AN groups is not known. Further study of the specific health effects of obesity in various groups of AI/ANs are needed. In the meantime, community-based programs to prevent obesity and its sequelae should be implemented in all AI/AN communities. 
Nongynecologic somatic pathology in women with chronic pelvic pain and negative laparoscopy. One hundred eighty-three women with chronic pelvic pain were referred to a multidisciplinary chronic pelvic pain clinic after negative laparoscopy. One hundred twenty-two of them completed a thorough medical and psychologic evaluation and were followed for a minimum of six months after completion of therapy. Occult somatic pathology was diagnosed in 57 women (47%), including 19 in whom coexistent psychopathology was diagnosed. Myofascial pain was the most common somatic diagnosis, followed by atypical cyclic pain (dysmenorrhea or mittelschmerz); gastroenterologic, urologic and infectious diseases; and pelvic vascular congestion. No plausible somatic etiology was apparent in the remaining 65 (53%) of the 122 referrals. Nongynecologic somatic pathology accounted for 34 (29%) and gynecologic pathology for 23 (19%) of the referrals, only 6 (5%) of whom ultimately required hysterectomy. Women with a somatic diagnosis were found to be significantly older than the remainder of the referral population. Long-term symptomatic improvement or resolution of pain was obtained in 43 (75%) of the 57 patients with somatic diagnoses. Coexistent psychopathology was found to correlate with a poorer long-term prognosis. Our findings underscore the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to evaluating and treating chronic pelvic pain in women and confirm that hysterectomy is indicated in this setting only rarely. 
Standards for evaluating and reporting the results of surgical and percutaneous therapy for peripheral arterial disease. By adopting precise definitions of essential terms, developing objective criteria by which the various measures of success or failure can be judged, and establishing a standardized scheme by which severity of disease, degrees of improvement or deterioration, and risk factors that affect outcome can be graded, the quality of published reports of revascularization procedures for lower extremity ischemia can be greatly improved, allowing comparative evaluation of treatment modalities. 
Histamine H2-receptor antagonists. In summary, histamine initiates acid secretion by stimulating the H2 subtype histamine receptor on parietal cells. Cimetidine, rantidine, famotidine, and nizantidine are histamine H2-receptor antagonists that block this action of histamine, reducing gastric acid output and concentration under both basal and stimulated conditions. These agents are used for treatment and prevention of peptic and stress ulcers as well as for hypersecretory states. Because of their effectiveness and low incidence of side effects, H2-antagonists have largely replaced more traditional antiulcer regimens. 
Verrucous carcinoma of the bladder. Verrucous carcinoma of the bladder unassociated with bilharzial cystitis is an exceedingly rare entity, with only 3 cases reported in the literature. We describe a patient and review the literature concerning verrucous carcinoma. 
Grafting of perfused adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease. Clinica Puerta de Hierro Neural Transplantation Group. The authors report results obtained in 20 severely affected patients with Parkinson's disease (Grade IV or V) who received an autotransplant of perfused adrenal medullary tissue. This study seems to indicate that these autoimplants can improve the parkinsonian symptomatology and induce amelioration in the patients' performance of routine activities. All the symptoms analyzed showed improvement, although it differed in intensity and time of onset. Moreover, this improvement was accompanied by a reduction in the daily intake of L-dopa, with discontinuance of dopamine agonists and amantadine. A number of medical complications were encountered, including three deaths, probably related to performing abdominal surgery in seriously affected parkinsonian patients who were unable to tolerate the discontinuance of their medication. The transient psychiatric disorders observed appeared to be related to the postoperative dose of L-dopa and/or anticholinergic agents administered, and diminished or disappeared when the doses were reduced. The reasons for improvement, which was bilateral, remain unknown, although one cause may be the surgical trauma (minicaudotomy) together with the implantation of adrenal medullary tissue, which may promote the sprouting of surviving dopaminergic fibers. Moreover, in this series, perfusion of adrenal medulla increased the capacity for revascularization of the tissue and may have reduced the damaging effects of warm ischemia on the cells. This, together with the existence of fenestrated vessels, could hypothetically have served as an access point for drugs, and if the implanted cells were viable, they might have served to store and manufacture different factors and/or transmitters. These results as well as those of other groups justify the development of a controlled international clinical trial. 
Principal causes of mechanical bowel obstruction in surgically treated adults in western Turkey. A retrospective study of the principal causes of mechanical bowel obstruction occurring in Western Turkey between 1979 and 1989 was undertaken. The records of 14,777 operations performed in the general surgery departments of two hospitals were reviewed. Mechanical bowel obstruction occurred in 582 patients. Among the causes of mechanical bowel obstruction, adhesions were most common (44.0 per cent), followed by strangulated hernia (23.9 per cent), volvuli (12.7 per cent) and colonic carcinomas (10.1 per cent). A previous appendicectomy appeared to be the most important cause of adhesions causing mechanical bowel obstruction. 
Undifferentiated carcinoma of parotid gland. Two cases of undifferentiated carcinomas of the major salivary glands were studied using immunohistochemical techniques. Results showed that this entity was a high grade malignant neoplasm arising from the excretory duct. Despite the undifferentiated appearance multiple immunophenotypes were evident in both cases. 
Functional properties of the beta-globin locus control region in K562 erythroleukemia cells. In this report, we compare the function of the human beta-globin locus control region (LCR) in three K562 erythroleukemia cell assays, including (1) a transient transfection assay for "classical" enhancer activity, (2) a colony assay that detects "productive integration events," and (3) an assay that detects the ability of LCR fragments to confer hemin inducibility on linked, stably integrated gamma-globin promoters. Various LCR fragments were inserted into an expression vector consisting of an A gamma-globin promoter driving the neomycin phosphotransferase gene (gamma-neo). Using these vectors, we determined that a 2.5-kb DNA fragment containing LCR sites I through IV (previously named mu locus activation region [mu LAR]) had activity in all three assays; of the individual LCR sites, only site II was highly active in all three assays. One region within site II, consisting of tandem AP-1/NF-E2 consensus elements, had approximately 10% as much colony assay activity as the entire mu LAR. However, this region did not have detectable activity in a transient enhancer assay in uninduced K562 cells, nor was it capable of conferring hemin inducibility on linked gamma-globin promoters in stably transfected cells. Finally, we tested the ability of the mu LAR to activate promoters (beta-globin and cathepsin G) that are not normally expressed in K562 cells. beta-neo was minimally activated by the mu LAR in transient transfection experiments. The mu LAR increased the number of stably transfected colonies produced by beta-neo, but the absolute number of beta-neo colonies, with or without the mu LAR, was approximately 10% to 20% that of gamma-neo. In contrast, a minimal cathepsin G promoter was activated by the mu LAR in K562 cells. Our results suggest that LCR functions are dependent in part on the environments and the promoters with which the LCR is tested. 
Effects of urokinase and heparin on minimal cross-sectional area of the culprit narrowing in unstable angina pectoris. The immediate and delayed effects of urokinase and heparin on minimal cross-sectional area of a patent ischemia-producing coronary artery were prospectively investigated in 43 patients with unstable angina. After baseline angiography, patients were randomized to 3 different treatment groups: group I--urokinase (1,000,000 U intravenous bolus dose), followed by heparin infusion 3 hours later; group II--heparin (10,000 U intravenous bolus, followed by continuous infusion); and group III--conventional therapy only (intravenous nitroglycerin, beta blockers and calcium antagonists). Angiography was repeated at 1 hour and at 8 days of treatment and minimal cross-sectional area was determined in the 35 patients who completed the study. In group I, minimal cross-sectional area increased from 0.84 +/- 0.48 mm2 at baseline to 0.94 +/- 0.49 mm2 at 1 hour (p less than 0.05), and to 1.00 +/- 0.51 mm2 at 8 days (p less than 0.01 vs baseline). In group II, a significant increase in minimal cross-sectional area was observed only at the 8-day angiography (0.64 +/- 0.39 mm2 at baseline; 0.67 +/- 0.37 mm2 at 1 hour [p = not significant]; and 0.79 +/- 0.48 mm2 at 8 days [p less than 0.01] vs baseline). In group III, no significant changes in minimal cross-sectional area occurred either at 1 hour or at 8 days. Thus, both urokinase and heparin improved lesion geometry in patients with unstable angina, although a large individual variation was noticed. The effect occurred earlier with urokinase than with heparin. 
Predominant expression of lambda light chain in adult cases with non-T-cell acute lymphocytic and chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis. The authors investigated cytoplasmic immunoglobulins of the leukemic cells from 20 adult cases with non-T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and from three cases with chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis using immunoelectron microscopy. They also studied these cases using various monoclonal antibodies. Of the 23 examined cases, nine were negative for both heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins; the authors defined these as common ALL. Two cases were positive for the mu chain but were negative for light chains; the authors defined these as pre-B-cell ALL. The remaining 12 cases were positive for either kappa or lambda light chains; these were defined as B-cell ALL. Of the 12 cases positive for light chains, 11 were positive for the lambda chain. Seven cases of the 11 positive cases for the lambda chain were negative for heavy chains. Eleven cases were positive either for both My4 and My9 or for one of the two antibodies. From these results, the authors conclude the following: (1) the ratio of pre-B-cell ALL among non-T-cell ALL cases (two of 23 cases) was lower in adults than in children; (2) of the light chain-positive cases, the lambda light chain-positive cases predominated (11 of 12 cases); (3) heavy chain-negative, lambda chain-positive cases (seven cases) were observed; and (4) one half of the leukemia cases showed dual phenotypes of B-cell and myeloid cell lineages. 
Cytokine gene expression in the islets of the diabetic Biobreeding/Worcester rat. The Biobreeding Worcester rat provides one of the best models of autoimmune diabetes. Immunopathologic studies of acute diabetes show that the islets are infiltrated by T cells and macrophages. It has been hypothesized that the islets are damaged by the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha and that their function may be altered by IL-6. In this study, we utilized in situ hybridization to determine the expression of the IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 genes within the pancreas of the acute diabetic Biobreeding Worcester rat. These studies showed that cells expressing IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 were present within the islets and in the exocrine pancreas surrounding islets, ducts, and vessels and in an interstitial location. Cells expressing TNF and IL-1 mRNA were present in about 20% of the islets, whereas cells expressing IL-6 were present in about 4% of the islets. Islets containing TNF- or IL-1-positive cells contained about three positive cells per islet whereas only about one IL-6-positive cell was present per islet. In 26% of the islets peri-insular TNF-positive cells were found. Peri-insular IL-1 positive cells were seen in 14% of the islets and 8% showed peri-insular IL-6 positive cells. In nondiabetic 30-day old DP or 90-day-old DR rats intra-islet cytokine gene expression was not seen. Our studies support the view that cytokines are important in beta cell destruction. 
Cerebrovascular accident complicating acute myocardial infarction: incidence, clinical significance and short- and long-term mortality rates. The SPRINT Study Group. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report the incidence, the antecedents, and the clinical significance of clinically recognized cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks (CVA-TIA) complicating acute myocardial infarction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 1981 to 1983, a secondary prevention study with nifedipine (SPRINT) was conducted in 14 hospitals in Israel among 2,276 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the study, demographic, historical, and medical data were collected on special forms for all patients with diagnosed acute myocardial infarction in 13 of these 14 hospitals (the SPRINT registry, n = 5,839). Mortality follow-up was completed for 99% of hospital survivors for a mean follow-up of 5.5 years (range: 4.5 to 7 years). RESULTS: The incidence of CVA-TIA was 0.9% (54 of 5,839). The latter rate increased significantly only with age, from 0.4% among patients up to 59 years old to 1.6% among those aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Multivariate analysis identified age, congestive heart failure, and history of stroke as predictors of CVA-TIA during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Patients with CVA-TIA exhibited a complicated hospital course, with a 15-day mortality rate of 41%. Subsequent mortality rates in survivors at 1 and 5 years were 34% and 59%, respectively. Rates at the same time points in patients without CVA-TIA were 16%, 11%, and 29% (p less than 0.01). In a multivariate analysis that included age, gender, congestive heart failure, history of previous myocardial infarction, and hypertension, CVA-TIA was independently associated with increased 15-day mortality (covariate-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.62; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.59 to 4.32), as well as subsequent 1-year (OR = 3.29; 90% CI, 1.70 to 6.36) and long-term (mean follow-up = 5.5 years) mortality (OR = 2.46; 90% CI, 1.30 to 4.69). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of consecutive patients with myocardial infarction, CVA-TIA was a relatively infrequent complication of acute myocardial infarction. Factors independently favoring the occurrence of CVA-TIA were old age, previous CVA, and congestive heart failure. CVA-TIA occurring during acute myocardial infarction independently increased the risk of early death threefold as well as the risk of long-term mortality in early-phase survivors. (2.5-fold). 
Low-back pain and disk degeneration in children: a case-control MR imaging study. Thirty-nine 15-year-old children with low-back pain (LBP) and 39 asymptomatic control children were selected from a population of 1,503 children of the same age for a magnetic resonance imaging study of the lumbar spine. Subjects with LBP were matched with control subjects by age, sex, and school class. Disk degeneration (DD) was present in 15 (38%) of the children with LBP and in 10 (26%) of the control subjects. Lumbar degeneration was most frequently associated with disk protrusion and Scheuermann-type changes. Of assessed structural abnormalities (disk protrusion, Scheuermann-type changes, transitional vertebra, and disk space narrowing), only disk protrusion was more common in children of the LBP group than in control subjects. The authors conclude that DD is a frequent finding among children with LBP at the age of 15 years. Asymptomatic (possibly physiologic) DD also is frequently found in children of this age. Whether DD associated with structural changes predisposes to low-back disorders can be confirmed only by means of a longitudinal follow-up study. 
Motor responses after transcranial electrical stimulation of cerebral hemispheres with a degenerated pyramidal tract. Motor responses were evoked in the thenar muscles by transcranial electrical cortex stimulation in 5 stroke patients with an isolated lacuna in the internal capsule, in whom wallerian degeneration of the pyramidal tract was demonstrated in vivo. Suprathreshold stimulation of the affected hemisphere elicited bilateral motor responses; whereas, stimulation at identical intensities of the undamaged hemisphere yielded strictly unilateral responses in the contralateral hand, like the responses of all normal control subjects. Focused magnetic brain stimulation was performed in 1 patient and gave identical results. Because muscular excitability to cortical stimulation is preserved in spite of pyramidal tract disruption, other pathways must bypass the lesion. Because of the bilaterality of responses, we suggest polysynaptic corticoreticulospinal connections. 
The Libyan Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease focus in Israel: an epidemiologic evaluation. In a country-wide study of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in Israel, we diagnosed 114 cases, among them 49 Libyan-born, with onset of their disease during the years 1963-1987. After age adjustment, the mean annual incidence rate per million population was 43 among Libyan-born and 0.9 in the rest of the population. Among Jews born in Egypt and Tunisia, neighboring countries of Libya, the adjusted rates were higher than in the other Israelis (3.5 and 2.3 per million, respectively). Among Libyan Jews, there was no association between incidence rate of CJD and age at immigration, ie, duration of exposure to hypothetical infectious factor in Libya. The percent of familial cases among Libyan Jews (41 to 47%) is one of the highest ever published. Genetic factors seem to be important for the high incidence of CJD among Libyan Jews. 
Paradoxical vocal cord motion: an unusual cause of stridor. Stridor due to obstructive causes is relatively common. Functional airway obstruction with paradoxical vocal cord motion is uncommon. Only 12 cases have been reported in the literature in the past 15 years. The majority were young female patients. We have recently encountered two cases. Lack of awareness of this condition caused several problems in management. 
Cystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis in Coats' disease. A 28-year-old man with unilateral Coats' disease and cystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis underwent successful juxtafoveolar argon green laser photocoagulation therapy with resolution of the edema and improvement in metamorphopsia and visual acuity. Despite this success, the effect of laser therapy in these patients remains uncertain. It should be considered only after detailed discussion with the patient about the possibility of posttreatment paracentral scotomata and the alternative of a reasonable period of observation for possible spontaneous resolution of the edema. 
Seasonality of disease in Kuwait. To compare the seasonal variation in total mortality and deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, and malignant disease, data were collected from North-East Scotland (Grampian region) and Kuwait. Seasonal differences were similar, in both timing and degree, for total mortality and deaths from circulatory disease, but were greater in Kuwait for respiratory disease. Peak mortality was during winter in both areas: in Grampian, when the climate is most uncomfortable, and in Kuwait, when the climate is at its most comfortable. Socioeconomic changes in Kuwait have been accompanied by a rapid fall in the degree of seasonality (deseasonality) for both total and infant mortality. These findings suggest that mortality peaks in winter, not because of a seasonally low temperature, but because of a seasonal fall in mean temperature irrespective of the annual mean temperature. 
Limited heterogeneity of the HLA class II contribution to susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis is suggested by positive associations with HLA-DR4, DR1 and DRw10. Most patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) exhibit an HLA class II epitope found on most DR4 and DR1 molecules. We have investigated the possibility of other associations being present in the minority of patients lacking these antigens. One hundred and eighty patients with classical or definite RA and 100 controls were assigned HLA-DR, DQ and DP types by a DNA-based system using sequence-specific oligonucleotides to probe amplified class II alleles amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The expected associations with DR4 (relative risk 10, P less than 0.0001) and DR1 (relative risk 2.3, P less than 0.001) were observed and only 13% of individuals lacked both of these alleles compared with 54% of age- and race-matched controls. A significant association with DRw10 (P = 0.02) was also observed in the DR4/DR1-negative RA group (3/23 patients compared with 0/54 DR4/DR1-negative controls). No novel associations with other DR, DQ, or DP alleles were evident in contrast to some previous studies. The third allelic hypervariable region of the DR beta chain of DRw10 contains a similar amino acid sequence to that found in many DR4 and DR1 molecules. These results extend this correlation and suggest that this susceptibility determinant may account for the HLA-linked susceptibility in 89% of our cases of RA. 
Von Hippel-Lindau disease and erythrocytosis: radioimmunoassay of erythropoietin in cyst fluid from a brainstem hemangioblastoma. A 59-year-old woman with von Hippel-Lindau disease developed erythrocytosis and a recurrent intracranial hemangioblastoma. Radioimmunoassay showed an elevated level of erythropoietin in her serum. Cyst fluid from the tumor also contained erythropoietin, concentrated a thousandfold relative to the serum level. Production of erythropoietin by hemangioblastomas may explain the erythrocytosis present in some patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. 
Plasticity of central motor pathways in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. To obtain neurophysiologic evidence for a reorganization of central motor pathways in children who had suffered a cerebral lesion at birth, we performed cross-correlation analyses of multiunit EMG recordings obtained from children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and marked mirror movements. We found that the motoneuron pools of homologous left and right hand muscles received common synaptic input from abnormally branched presynaptic axons. The results of electromagnetic brain stimulation, cutaneomuscular, and tendon reflex testing suggested that these common inputs are provided by abnormally branched corticospinal tract fibers whose origin is the undamaged motor cortex. 
Serotonin antagonists: a new class of antiemetic agents. Despite a number of significant advances over the past decade, prevention and treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis remain formidable problems, particularly with cisplatin-containing regimens. Nearly one third of patients receiving high-dose cisplatin still experience substantial emesis despite the best available conventional antiemetics, and the toxic effects of these agents remain quite troublesome. In recent years, a new class of agents, the serotonin antagonists, has been identified. These agents hold promise for clinical utility in a wide range of areas. Selective antagonists of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 3 (5-HT3) receptor have proven in early clinical trials to be potent antiemetic agents in patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, with efficacy comparable to or superior to that of conventional antiemetics. Toxic effects to date with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists have been modest. The current state of knowledge with respect to these agents as antiemetics for patients receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy is summarized. 
Recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after autologous bone marrow transplantation for relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: blood and bone marrow progenitor growth studies. A phase II Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial. Sixteen patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation and infusion of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF). Treatment consisted of involved-field radiotherapy, cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/d intravenously (IV) for 2 days, and fractionated total body irradiation (1,200 cGy). Autologous bone marrow was thawed and infused IV, followed 3 hours later by the first infusion of IV rhGM-CSF 11 micrograms/kg/d over 4 hours. Infusions of rhGM-CSF were continued daily until either both neutrophil count exceeded 1,500/microL and platelet count exceeded 50,000/microL, or until 30 days after marrow re-infusion. Toxicities encountered were mild and included fever, chills, hypertension, alopecia, rash, diarrhea, stomatitis, myalgias, and synovial (knee) effusions. Neutrophil recovery greater than 500/microL occurred a median of 14 days (range, 9 to 30 days) after marrow infusion, significantly earlier than in a comparable group of historic controls who recovered counts at a median time of 20 days (range, 12 to 51 days) (P = .00002). Median time to self-sustaining platelet counts greater than 20,000/microL was 23.5 days (range, 12 to 100 days), comparable with the historic group (P = .38). One bacteremia (central venous catheter exit site infection with Staphylococcus epidermidis) and one local infection (Giardia lamblia in stool) occurred. Patients received a median of 11.4 (range, 4.4 to 20.2) x 10(4) colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitors per kg. Stem cell progenitors CFU-GM, CFU-granulocyte, erythroid, monocyte, megakaryocyte (CFU-GEMM), and burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) were detected in the bone marrow as early as 7 days after marrow re-infusion, and increased in proportion to peripheral blood counts, but by 30 to 60 days still remained much lower than before transplant. Neutrophils transiently decreased in 13 of 16 patients (median decrease, 42%) within 24 to 72 hours of discontinuing rhGM-CSF infusions. These data suggest that rhGM-CSF therapy enhances neutrophil recovery by forcing stem cells to produce mature elements at an enhanced rate but may not affect marrow stem cell and early progenitor population sizes. 
Hemodynamics in the prone jackknife position during surgery. We examined the hemodynamic changes occurring with prone jackknife positioning during colorectal surgery. The operative procedure was restorative proctocolectomy with ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis in five patients with adenomatosis coli and six patients with ulcerative colitis and anoabdominal resection of the rectum with colonic J-pouch anal anastomosis in eight patients with rectal cancer. Nineteen patients (10 men and 9 women aged 41 +/- 19 years) were monitored with arterial and Swan-Ganz catheters during positioning. Measurements were obtained in the supine and prone positions (1 minute, 3 minutes), and the jackknife position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes), as well as before and after adoption of the Lloyd-Davies position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes). Turning the patient from the supine position to the prone position resulted in a significant decrease in the cardiac index (CI). However, following head-down rotation, the CI increased and returned to the value seen in the supine position (p less than 0.05). Heart rate (HR) slowed and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased in the prone jackknife position. We concluded that the extent of the changes in cardiac function presented no serious problems. 
Impassable ureteral strictures: management with percutaneous ureteroneocystostomy. Sixteen of 227 patients referred for percutaneous placement of a ureteral stent had impassable stenoses. Stenoses were benign (n = 8) or attributed to malignant retroperitoneal neoplasm (n = 8). Electrocautery was used to create a neotract between the stenosed ureter and the bladder or ileal loop. A double-J stent was placed after dilation of the tract by use of angioplasty. Neotracts were established and stents were placed in all patients. Complications (digestive tract fistulas) developed in two patients. This technique is safe if the electrode is placed close to the bladder or ileal loop. The procedure can be used as an alternative to surgery or permanent nephrostomy or in initial treatment of benign anastomotic stenosis. 
Effect of granulocytopenia on oral microbial relationships in patients with acute leukemia. Risk for acute infection increases as granulocyte levels decrease secondary to myelosuppressive chemotherapy in patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). Acute exacerbations of concomitant inflammatory periodontal diseases can result in systemic infections in these patients. However, host-oral bacterial relationships in the periodontium in patients with ANLL are not well understood. Twenty-one adult patients with ANLL with periodontal disease ranging from gingivitis to severe periodontitis were studied. Supragingival and subgingival plaque specimens were collected before chemotherapy (prechemotherapy), and at a defined midpoint of myelosuppression (midchemotherapy; day 14). All specimens were extensively cultured both aerobically and anaerobically. Data were submitted to a partial correlational analysis, controlling for covariation relation to oral hygiene intervention and antibiotic administration. Levels of total yeast exhibited a significant association with Staphylococcus sp. at supragingival sites midchemotherapy (r = 0.68, p less than or equal to 0.05). Levels of total yeast also correlated positively with Pseudomonas aeruginosa at subgingival sites both prechemotherapy (r = 0.70, p less than or equal to 0.01) and midchemotherapy (r = 0.61, p less than or equal to 0.05). Significant correlations of levels of Veillonella sp. with Neisseria sp. and gram-negative enteric bacilli were observed in both supragingival (r = 0.95, 0.77, p values less than or equal to 0.01) and subgingival (r = 0.69, 0.61, p values less than or equal to 0.05) plaque specimens midchemotherapy but not prechemotherapy. These data suggest that potentially pathogenic bacteria occur in plaque simultaneous with granulocytopenia in these patients. Multiple mechanisms, including intergeneric coaggregation and other symbiotic relationships, may influence infectivity of the mixed plaque flora and thus contribute to the oral ecology observed in these patients. 
The effect of nicardipine on vasospasm in rabbit basilar artery after subarachnoid hemorrhage. This study was performed to examine the effect of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, nicardipine, on vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the rabbit. The study was carried out in two parts: 1) effect of intravenous nicardipine (n = 45) and 2) effect of intracisternal nicardipine (n = 21). SAH was induced by injecting 5 ml of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna. In the intravenous study, there were five groups: 1) SAH without treatment; 2) SAH with vehicle (saline); 3) SAH and intravenous infusion of low-dose nicardipine (0.01 mg/kg/h); 4) SAH and intravenous infusion of high-dose nicardipine (0.15 mg/kg/h); and 5) controls without SAH. The intravenous infusions were started immediately after SAH and continued for 48 hours until death. In the intracisternal study, there were three groups: 1) SAH without treatment; 2) SAH with intracisternal administration of nicardipine (0.37 mg/h); and 3) controls without SAH. Intracisternal infusions were begun 70 hours after SAH and continued for 2 hours until death. After perfusion-fixation, the basilar artery was removed and processed for morphometric analysis. In the intravenous study, vessels from animals subjected to SAH were significantly narrowed when compared with controls, although after high-dose nicardipine vessel caliber was slightly larger than in the other SAH groups. Animals given intracisternal nicardipine showed a nonsignificant reduction of caliber as compared with controls: only 12% decrease in diameter and 22% decrease in luminal area. In the rabbit SAH model, nicardipine had a very modest effect on vasospasm at the doses tested. 
Regression of carotid plaques during low density lipoprotein cholesterol elimination. We performed serial prospective ultrasound examinations of four flat and 17 soft carotid plaques during an average of 17 months in seven patients with heterozygous hypercholesterolemia during heparin-induced extracorporeal low density lipoprotein elimination on precipitation from plasma. By means of a specially designed quantitative three-dimensional ultrasound analysis, significant plaque volume reduction could be evaluated in all subjects, along with a marked reduction of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and fibrinogen serum levels. 
Dipyridamole thallium scanning in the evaluation of coronary artery disease in elective abdominal aortic surgery. Dipyridamole thallium scanning was routinely performed on 68 consecutive patients who presented for elective aortic surgery. All 68 patients were judged by clinical assessment to be at low risk for perioperative cardiac complications. In addition, 42 of 68 patients had a history of myocardial infarction, stable angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 1). Twenty-six of 68 patients did not have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings (group 2). In group 1, 34 of 4 patients had positive results on dipyridamole thallium scanning, and 15 of these patients were found to have critical coronary artery disease on subsequent cardiac catheterization; nine underwent immediate coronary artery bypass grafting, and six had their coronary artery disease treated medically and their vascular operations cancelled. The remaining 27 patients in group 1 underwent elective operations, with six (22%) of 27 sustaining postoperative cardiac complications. None of the group 2 patients was found to have critical coronary artery disease. All patients in group 2 underwent aortic operation without cardiac complication. Routine dipyridamole thallium scanning detected a 22% (15 of 68) incidence of critical coronary artery disease overall. There was a 36% (15 of 42) incidence of critical coronary artery disease in group 1 patients vs 0% in group 2 patients (95% confidence interval, 21% to 50%). We conclude that the use of dipyridamole thallium scanning in low-risk patients for cardiac screening prior to elective aortic operations is beneficial in selected patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, angina, or abnormal echocardiographic findings, but is not necessary in patients with no history of coronary artery disease. 
Results of the Duhamel operation in the treatment of idiopathic megarectum and megacolon. The results of the Duhamel operation in patients with idiopathic megarectum and megacolon have been reviewed. Twenty patients (14 males, six females) underwent the Duhamel operation over a 17-year period for this condition. The mean age at operation was 25 years; the mean age of onset of constipation was 3 years; and the mean follow-up period was 4.5 years. All the resected colons were of enlarged diameter. There was agreement between the preoperative radiographs and the operative specimens with regard to which parts of the rectum and colon were dilated. Subjective feelings of well-being were generally improved by surgery, as was bowel frequency in ten patients. Soiling, straining, abdominal pain and distension were, however, common after operation. Early complications were also common and five patients required further surgery for constipation. The Duhamel operation for megarectum and megacolon is characterized by an improved sense of well-being and improved bowel frequency, but it is associated with the persistence of many symptoms and further surgery is often required. 
Renal pelvic explosion during conservative management of upper tract urothelial cancer. Ureteroscopic fulguration of a renal pelvic papillary transitional cell carcinoma is a relatively new and limited procedure. We present a case of intrarenal explosion during ureteroscopic fulguration. 
Effect of hyaluronic acid on postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation in the rat model. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid solution in preventing intraperitoneal (IP) adhesions. DESIGN AND SETTING: The study design was prospective, randomized and blinded and involved 83 rats. INTERVENTIONS: Measured serosal injury was inflicted using a CO2 laser on the right uterine horn of the rat. Animals randomized to groups 1 and 2 received either 0.4% hyaluronic acid or its diluent phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) intraperitoneally before and after the injury. In groups 3 and 4, the same solutions were used only after the injury. Postoperative adhesions were assessed at second-look laparotomy. Histologic assessment of the fresh laser injury was carried out on uteri pretreated with hyaluronic acid, PBS, or nothing. MAIN OUTCOME: Pretreatment with hyaluronic acid was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative adhesions and a significantly decreased crater depth. CONCLUSIONS: Hyaluronic acid appears to reduce postoperative IP adhesion formation by coating the serosal surfaces and decreasing the extent of initial tissue injury. 
Adrenal hemangioma: an unusual adrenal mass delineated with magnetic resonance imaging. Adrenal hemangioma should be included in the differential diagnosis of any large calcified adrenal mass. We report to our knowledge the eighth surgically removed lesion and describe its appearance on magnetic resonance imaging. This imaging includes features seen in hemangiomas elsewhere, in particular a heterogeneous mass with enhancing peripheral high intensity foci on T1 images. 
Effects of a moderate dose of alcohol on blood lipids and lipoproteins postprandially and in the fasting state. Effects of a moderate dose of alcohol on blood lipids and lipoproteins were studied in volunteers of two age groups (20-30 and 45-55 years), each consisting of eight healthy men. The alcohol (30 g in red port and wine) was consumed during a standard dinner. Two blood samples were drawn: one in the postprandial phase, and one the next morning after fasting overnight. In the postprandial phase, one hour after intake, alcohol increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) by 11.5%, triglycerides (TG) by 15.3% and apolipoprotein A2 (Apo-A2) by 7.3% (P = 0.002, P = 0.044 and P = 0.024, respectively). The increase in HDL-C appeared to be mainly attributed to the HDL2-C subfraction which increased by 15.3% (P = 0.066). Furthermore, the increases in HDL-C, HDL2-C and TG were more pronounced in the middle-aged men then in the young men. After fasting overnight the effects of alcohol had disappeared. 
Subdiaphragmatic extralobar pulmonary sequestration. A 21-day-old girl presented with a left subdiaphragmatic retroperitoneal mass discovered on maternal ultrasound at 23 weeks' gestation. The clinical impression was neuroblastoma, and preoperative workup showed no for metastatic disease. Histologically, the lesion proved to be an extralobar pulmonary sequestration. We present this case to remind pathologists of the occurrence of subdiaphragmatic pulmonary sequestration and its potential clinical confusion with other more familiar lesions that may occur in this location in a neonate. 
Primary ocular malignant lymphoma associated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A 42-year-old man who was human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive complained of floaters in his right eye, which had existed for 1 week, followed by loss of central vision. Results of ophthalmoscopic examination disclosed confluent yellowish-white retinochoroidal infiltrates with perivascular sheathing, which were more prominent superiorly in the right eye. Approximately 10 small, white, intraretinal and choroidal lesions were observed in the nasal periphery of the left eye. Results of cytologic examination of the vitreous of the right eye showed neoplastic cells characteristic of large cell type malignant lymphoma. Shortly thereafter, cytologic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid also showed large cell malignant lymphoma. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass involving the left cerebellar hemisphere. After bilateral whole-eye radiation therapy, there was complete resolution of the lymphomatous retinochoroidal infiltrates in both eyes. The ophthalmologic and neurologic manifestations of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are discussed. The authors believe this is the first report of ocular malignant lymphoma occurring in a patient with AIDS. 
Facial nerve monitoring in acoustic tumor surgery. Anatomic and functional preservation of the facial nerve during acoustic tumor surgery remains a primary goal. Intraoperative electromyographic facial nerve monitoring with auditory feedback has enabled the surgeon to more readily achieve this goal. We compared a group of monitored translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removals (N = 89) to a similar unmonitored group (N = 155) in regard to facial nerve function. Function was assessed immediately postoperatively, at time of discharge, and at 1 year postoperatively using the House six-point scale. Results were grouped as satisfactory, intermediate, or poor and were analyzed by tumor size. Facial nerve results were better at all time intervals in the monitored groups, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 1-year interval. There was no difference between monitored and unmonitored patients in the subgroups with tumors smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter. This study supports the usefulness of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in improving facial nerve results, particularly in larger tumors. 
Ultrasonographical investigation of periportal fibrosis in children with Schistosoma mansoni infection: reversibility of morbidity seven months after treatment with praziquantel. Five hundred thirty six Sudanese schoolchildren with Schistosoma mansoni infection were treated at random with either 20 mg or 40 mg/kg praziquantel. Seven months later 420 children could be reinvestigated by ultrasonography. Reduction of egg excretion and reversibility of sonographically-proven periportal fibrosis (PF) was not significantly different in the two groups. Schistosoma mansoni-induced PF grade II decreased from 22.9% to 6.7% and grade III from 5.2% to 1.6%. An increased prevalence of PF grade I, from 10% to 29.8% of the investigated patients, was observed. This increase was caused partly by a downshifting of patients who had PF II (n = 45) and PF III (n = 8) before therapy, but also by patients who developed PF I in the seven months after therapy (n = 56). The overall percentage of patients with PF before and after treatment was 38.1%. Of 420 children, 17.4% increased in their PF grade, 55% remained at the same level and 27.6% improved. Children younger than 11 years of age had a higher rate of complete reversibility than older ones. The percentage of patients with hepatomegaly decreased significantly (11.6% to 6.9%; p = 0.001). The rate of splenomegaly remained unchanged. It was concluded that within seven months therapy with praziquantel resulted in a considerable qualitative improvement of PF in Sudanese schoolchildren with S. mansoni infection. 
Cancer mortality in Cuba and among the Cuban-born in the United States: 1979-81. The Cuban-born population of the United States, enumerated at 608,000 in the 1980 census, has been little studied with regard to cancer mortality. Being older and rarely migrating back to Cuba, Cuban Americans present a good subject for comparative cancer mortality. Age-adjusted death rates for selected causes of cancer are compared in this paper for Cubans in Cuba, the Cuban-born in the United States, and all whites in the United States. Two forms of cancer have been of particular concern in Cuba, cancer of the lung and cancer of the prostate, because of their relatively high death rates. The age-adjusted death rates for both of these cancers are lower among the Cuban-born in the United States than they are among Cubans in Cuba and whites in the United States. Death rates for cancer of the cervix and cancer of the rectum among the Cuban-born in this country are also low relative to Cubans in Cuba and whites in the United States. Stomach cancer mortality among Cuban-born men in the United States is lower than for men in Cuba or for white men in the United States, but Cuban-born women in this country have rates that are slightly higher than those of U.S white women. Mortality rates from colon cancer in both sexes and breast cancer among women are intermediate between the lower rates in Cuba and the higher rates among U.S. whites. Finally, the Cuban-born in the United States have higher death rates from cancer of the liver than do Cubans in Cuba or whites in the United States. 
SPECT, MRI and cognitive functions in multiple sclerosis. Seventeen patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) and mild physical disability had neuropsychological testing, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) using technetium 99m (99mTc) hexamethyl-propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO). Performance in verbal fluency, naming and memory testing appeared to be impaired in MS patients compared with 17 age-sex and education matched normal controls. Weighted periventricular and confluent lesion scores and the width of the third ventricle, proved to be the most sensitive MRI measures in differentiating more cognitively impaired patients from those who were relatively unimpaired. Ratios of regional to whole brain activity, measured by SPECT, showed significant reduction in the frontal lobes and in the left temporal lobe of MS patients. A relationship was found between left temporal abnormality in 99mTc-HMPAO uptake and deficit in verbal fluency and verbal memory. Finally, asymmetrical lobar activity indicated a predominant left rather than right temporo-parietal involvement. 
Antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of enalapril and slow-release verapamil in essential hypertension: a double-blind, cross-over study. The antihypertensive efficacy and tolerability of enalapril (E) and slow-release verapamil (V) were compared in a 2-month double-blind cross-over study in 22 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension. After 1 month, significantly lower systolic (P less than 0.01) and diastolic (P less than 0.02) blood pressures (BP) were achieved with E, 20 mg d-1, compared with V, 240 mg d-1. After 2 months of treatment, BP reductions were similar after E, 40 mg d-1, and V, 240 mg twice a day. The fall in supine mean BP after 2 months of treatment with V was significantly greater in patients aged greater than or equal to 50 years of age (P = 0.02) (median 18 mmHg) than in patients aged less than 50 years (10 mmHg). E showed similar effectiveness in both age groups. Statistical group analysis of a quality-of-life questionnaire showed no significant differences between the active drugs and the placebo. It is concluded that E and V are equally effective as antihypertensive agents, and that both drugs are well tolerated. 
Thermal laser-assisted balloon angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery: a multicenter review of 602 cases. A multicenter review of 602 procedures was performed to evaluate the effects of thermal laser-assisted balloon angioplasty on the superficial femoral artery. Four hundred thirty-nine (73%) patients underwent laser-assisted balloon angioplasty for claudication, and 163 (27%) underwent the procedure for limb salvage. Two hundred ninety-two laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures were performed for multifocal stenotic disease (greater than 80%) diameter reduction), 258 for total occlusion, and 52 procedures for both superficial femoral artery stenosis and occlusion. The initial recanalization rate was 89% (538/602) depending on the length of the lesion. Success of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was verified by angioscopy or arteriography, and all patients underwent segmental Doppler studies before discharge and during midterm follow-up extending to 30 months (mean, 11.3 months). Complications occurred in 62 (10%) patients, but only one limb amputation occurred because of a complication related to a laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Overall, 60% of initially successful procedures have remained patent, but long segment (greater than 7 cm) occlusions have fared poorly (25% patency at 30 months). This minimally invasive technology affords the opportunity to treat short segment (less than 7 cm) symptomatic superficial femoral artery occlusive disease with minimal risk. Initial success and midterm patency rates for appropriate lesions appear to make laser-assisted balloon angioplasty a viable adjunct in the treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease. 
Smoking-attributable cancer mortality in 1991: is lung cancer now the leading cause of death among smokers in the United States? Findings from the new American Cancer Society prospective study of 1.2 million men and women indicate that mortality risks among smokers have increased substantially for most of the eight major cancer sites causally associated with cigarette smoking. Lung cancer risk for male smokers doubled, while the risk for females increased more than fourfold. On the basis of the new American Cancer Society relative risks, we project that cigarette smoking alone will contribute to slightly more than 157,000 of the 514,000 total cancer deaths expected to occur in the United States in 1991. Overall, smoking directly contributes to 21.5% of all cancer deaths in women but 45% of all cancer deaths in men. It would also appear that lung cancer has now displaced coronary heart disease as the single leading cause of excess mortality among smokers in the United States. 
Reentrant excitation around a fixed obstacle in uniform anisotropic ventricular myocardium BACKGROUND. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of tissue anisotropy and dispersion of refractoriness on initiation of reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT). METHODS AND RESULTS. A ring of perfused uniform anisotropic ventricular epicardium in Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts was created by an endocardial freezing technique. High-resolution mapping (248 channels) was used to analyze epicardial activation of the left ventricle. One to three premature beats were induced at a total of 272 points in 17 experiments (16 different points around the ring in each experiment). Reentrant VT could be initiated at 43 of the 272 points tested. The cycle length of VT was stable and ranged from 128 to 198 msec (mean, 161 +/- 19 msec). Correlation between conduction velocity and the angle between the circulating activation wave and epicardial fiber orientation showed that in segments of the ring where conduction was perpendicular to the fiber axis, mean conduction velocity was 25 +/- 5 cm/sec compared with 60 +/- 7 cm/sec when conduction was parallel to the fiber orientation. Analysis of the site of unidirectional conduction block showed that in 41 of 43 cases, block occurred while the impulse was propagating parallel to the fiber orientation. Measurement of the refractory periods at either side of the line of unidirectional block showed that only in 12 of 43 cases did block occur while the impulse was propagating into an area with a longer (more than 10 msec) refractory period. CONCLUSIONS. In uniform anisotropic ventricular myocardium, reentrant VT is initiated because lowering the stimulating efficacy of the depolarization wave by premature beats leads to preferential conduction block parallel to the fiber orientation. 
Pharmacologic treatment of heart failure. An increased understanding of the pathophysiologic changes underlying CHF, advanced monitoring technology, and a wider array of drug therapy have improved the prognosis of patients with this disorder. These advances allow for greater individualization of therapy, improve patient compliance, and lower the incidence of undesirable side effects. Of course, with the increase in complexity of treatment choices comes the need for more knowledgeable practitioners who can select the most appropriate therapeutic approach. All practitioners also must make every effort to educate the patients about their disease, treatments, and necessary lifestyle changes so that optimal benefits can be realized. 
Subglottic cyst in a newborn. Subglottic laryngeal cysts in the newborn are extremely rare. It is difficult to establish if the cyst is acquired or congenital because respiratory distress requires intubation in the I.C.U. generally without prior endoscopy. A case report is presented, followed by a discussion of possible aetiology and management protocol; the advantages of the CO2 laser make excision of the cystic sac possible without tracheotomy. 
Seroepidemiology of Helicobacter pylori infection in India. Comparison of developing and developed countries. Helicobacter pylori (previously Campylobacter pylori) is now accepted as the major cause of type B gastritis and thus what is known about the epidemiology of type B gastritis can reasonably be transferred to H. pylori. We used a specific ELISA for anti-H. pylori IgG to study the prevalence of H. pylori infection in a population of lower socioeconomic class from Hyderabad, India. The results from India were compared to studies from other parts of the world. Two hundred thirty-eight individuals ages 3 to 70 participated. The frequency of H. pylori infection increased with age (P less than 0.01) and was greater than 80% by age 20. H. pylori infection was present in 79% of the population studied; there was no gender-related difference in prevalence of H. pylori infection. IgG antibody against hepatitis A (HAV) was rapidly acquired in Hyderabad; in a subset of 58 children between the ages of 3 and 21 tested, the frequency of anti-HAV was 98.2%. The prevalence of H. pylori infection increases with age in both developed and developing countries. The high age-specific prevalence of H. pylori infection in developing countries is probably a reflection of the lower socioeconomic level of those areas. 
Systemic and splanchnic hemodynamic effects of molsidomine in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis. Molsidomine, a long-acting vasodilator mainly used as an antianginal agent, was reported to decrease the portohepatic venous pressure gradient in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. This study investigated the effects of linsidomine, the active metabolite of molsidomine, on systemic and splanchnic hemodynamics in rats with CCl4-induced cirrhosis using the microsphere technique. Compared with placebo-treated rats, linsidomine-treated animals were found to have a significant decrease in portal venous pressure (-18%, p less than 0.01) and in mean arterial pressure (-16%, p less than 0.01), smaller peripheral resistances (p less than 0.01), greater portal venous inflow (p less than 0.05), smaller splanchnic arteriolar resistances (p less than 0.01) and smaller protocol-lateral resistances (p less than 0.05). Cardiac output, hepatic arterial blood flow, portal blood flow and estimated hepatic blood flow were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. Linsidomine-treated rats exhibited a trend toward greater collateral blood flow compared with controls, but this difference was not significant. We conclude that linsidomine decreases portal venous pressure by reducing portocollateral resistances without affecting liver blood flow. These effects should be beneficial for patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. 
Cervical anterior spinal artery syndrome associated with cardiopulmonary arrest. Nontraumatic spinal cord ischemia is uncommon, especially when the cervical cord is involved. We present an elderly man who sustained acute occlusion of the anterior spinal artery at a high cervical level. This was followed by a respiratory arrest due to the paralysis of the diaphragm and chest wall muscles. A review of the vascular supply to the cord and of nontraumatic ischemic myelopathy is provided. 
Intermediate procedures after first-stage Norwood operation facilitate subsequent repair. Actuarial analysis of survival after first-stage palliative reconstructive operation for hypoplastic left heart syndrome has revealed a high out-of-hospital attrition rate over the first 18 months to 2 years postoperatively. Some of this mortality is related to development of anatomical problems such as restrictive atrial septal defect, neoaortic arch obstruction, and pulmonary artery distortion. The bidirectional Glenn shunt has proved to be an ideal adjunctive procedure for high-risk patients at the time of operation to correct such intermediate-term problems. The fenestrated Fontan procedure, which involves fenestration of the interatrial baffle placed as part of our current standard Fontan procedure, is applied for patients considered to be at moderate risk for a Fontan procedure. The decision regarding closure of the fenestration is made by hemodynamic study including temporary balloon occlusion of the fenestration. The fenestration is closed with the double-clamshell device, which is placed percutaneously in the catheterization laboratory and which is currently used for secundum atrial septal defect closure. Appropriate selection of patients for the bidirectional Glenn shunt or fenestrated Fontan procedure with or without fenestration closure has resulted in a dramatic decrease in mortality and morbidity for patients with all forms of single ventricle and for patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. 
Supratentorial dermoid cysts. Supratentorial dermoid cysts are rare lesions. In eight cases presented here, the lack of recurrence after subtotal removal of the capsule and the good long-term prognosis are emphasized. This finding is in agreement with the literature. The frequent relationship of these lesions with the cavernous sinus suggests a vascular genesis in the development of intracranial dermoid cysts. 
Epilepsy and employment. A community based survey in an area of high unemployment. A community based survey was undertaken to assess the work record of patients with epilepsy in an area of high unemployment. One hundred and thirty seven epileptic patients were identified from a population of 23,837 persons of employable age registered with three urban group practices in North East England. The unemployment rate for economically active patients with epilepsy was 46% compared with 19% for an age and sex matched control population (p less than 0.01). Fifty nine per cent of patients with active epilepsy were unemployed. In those with an associated neurological or psychiatric handicap and those who were unskilled manual workers the unemployment rates were 79% and 77%, respectively. Patients with epilepsy were less likely to leave school with qualifications or undergo subsequent training or apprenticeships. They were more likely to be unskilled manual workers, single and living in rented accommodation. In an area of high unemployment patients with epilepsy have disproportionately greater difficulty finding work. High unemployment rates among patients with epilepsy are only one aspect of a spectrum of social and economic disadvantage. 
p53 mutations in human lymphoid malignancies: association with Burkitt lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We have investigated the frequency of p53 mutations in B- and T-cell human lymphoid malignancies, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the major subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. p53 exons 5-9 were studied by using genomic DNA from 197 primary tumors and 27 cell lines by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis and by direct sequencing of PCR-amplified fragments. Mutations were found associated with (i) Burkitt lymphoma (9/27 biopsies; 17/27 cell lines) and its leukemic counterpart L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (5/9), both of which also carry activated c-myc oncogenes, and (ii) B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (6/40) and, in particular, its stage of progression known as Richter's transformation (3/7). Mutations were not found at any significant frequency in other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In many cases, only the mutated allele was detectable, implying loss of the normal allele. These results suggest that (i) significant differences in the frequency of p53 mutations are present among subtypes of neoplasms derived from the same tissue; (ii) p53 may play a role in tumor progression in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia; (iii) the presence of both p53 loss/inactivation and c-myc oncogene activation may be important in the pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma and its leukemic form L3-type B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
Renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement. Renal cell carcinoma extends into the lumen of the inferior vena cava in approximately 4% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of the intracaval tumor thrombus with radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for this malignancy. From January 1977 to June 1990, 31 such patients were examined for combined problems of renal carcinoma and intracaval tumor extension. Twenty-six of these patients underwent radical nephrectomy and vena caval thrombectomy. Ten patients had tumor thrombus confined to the infrahepatic vena cava, 11 had retrohepatic caval involvement, and 5 had extension to the level of the diaphragm or into the right atrium. Surgical approach was dictated by the level of caval involvement. Control of the suprahepatic vena cava plus temporary occlusion of hepatic arterial and portal venous inflow were necessary in some cases; cardiopulmonary bypass was required for transatrial removal of more extensive tumors. Five of the 26 patients had evidence before operation of distant metastatic disease; none of these survived beyond 12 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of the 21 patients without known preoperative metastatic disease was 57%. Complete surgical excision of all gross tumor appears to be critical for long-term survival in these patients. 
Eosinophil activation and T lymphocyte infiltration in allergen-induced late phase skin reactions and classical delayed-type hypersensitivity. T lymphocyte infiltration is a well documented feature of classical delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions. Recently, we have shown that T lymphocytes and activated (EG2+) eosinophils accumulate in the allergen-induced late phase skin reaction (LPR). To compare the kinetics and phenotypic composition of these T lymphocyte responses, LPR and DTH reactions of comparable induration size were induced in atopic subjects. In addition, DTH and LPR were compared between atopic and nonatopic subjects. In atopic individuals, allergen challenge elicited a perivascular influx of T lymphocytes that was predominantly CD4+. Eosinophil accumulation and activation were also prominent. There was no cellular response to allergen challenge in the nonatropic group. In both groups, DTH responses showed an intense T cell infiltrate which was more dense and dispersed than in the LPR. CD4+ T cells predominated but at 48 h CD8+ numbers were also significantly increased. In DTH, total leukocyte numbers (CD45+) were increasing at 48 h, whereas in the LPR, cell numbers reached a plateau between 24 and 48 h. T cell activation (shown by expression of IL-2R) was more prominent in DTH. Endothelial expression of HLA-DR was increased in both LPR and DTH, implying the local release of inflammatory cytokines in both reactions. Small but significant numbers of activated eosinophils (EG2+) were detected in atopics and non-atopics at 24 h in DTH but not at 48 h. These findings suggest that the allergen-induced LPR induced in atopic subjects is, at least in part, a form of cell-mediated hypersensitivity but with T cell kinetics that differ from classical DTH. 
Double-blind comparison of perindopril and captopril in hypertension. Effects on left ventricular morphology and function. Using digitized M-mode echocardiograms, we compared, in a double-blind study, the effects of 4 to 8 mg perindopril given once daily and 25 to 50 mg captopril given twice daily on the left ventricle (LV) in 20 hypertensive patients. Both treatments significantly (P less than .001) lowered blood pressure, reducing systemic vascular resistances. After 3 months both drugs induced a comparable percentage of reduction in LV mass, with an increase in the peak rate of LV relaxation and no changes in the peak rate of LV contraction. Our results demonstrate that perindopril once daily is an effective antihypertensive agent; it is also able, like captopril, to induce regression of LV hypertrophy, with improvement in diastolic performance and no deterioration in ventricular systolic function. 
Optic neuropathy and central nervous system disease secondary to Sjogren's syndrome in a child. The authors describe a 10-year-old girl in whom optic neuropathy and central nervous system (CNS) disease developed in association with primary Sjogren's syndrome. There was angiographic evidence of cerebral vasculitis and multiple infarcts present on neuroimaging. Results of parotid biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid, and serologic analyses showed abnormalities that were consistent with the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome. Although the patient had optic disc pallor on initial evaluation, her color vision and acuity improved with immunosuppressive therapy, as did her other neurologic symptoms. The authors believe this represents the first reported case of optic neuropathy and CNS disease associated with primary Sjogren's syndrome in the pediatric population. The possibility of improvement in visual function with early institution of immunosuppressive therapy makes prompt diagnosis essential. 
Posthypoxic myoclonus (the Lance-Adams syndrome) in the intensive care unit. The neurological assessment of patients admitted to the intensive care unit after successful resuscitation from cardiopulmonary arrest may be difficult. We describe the cases of two patients who developed myoclonus within 24 hours of hypoxic respiratory and cardiac arrest. Initially, the clonic movements were thought to be generalised convulsions and were treated as such, until it became evident that the patients were aware and distressed. Posthypoxic myoclonus is a rare complication of successful cardiopulmonary resusitation. Recognition depends on the awareness that the syndrome exists, and is important so that correct therapy can be instituted. There may be important prognostic implications. Both our patients had normal intellectual recovery with moderate residual neurological disability from their movement disorder. 
Trauma-precipitated migrainous hemiparesis. Migraine is a pleomorphic condition in which neurologic manifestations may be absent or a minor or a major feature. Similarly, head injury may range from trivial to lethal with regard to neurologic morbidity. Migraine may be precipitated by a variety of stimuli, including head trauma, significant or trivial. Presented is the case of a patient with migrainous hemiparesis precipitated by minor head injury. The clinical features and laboratory and radiological findings of trauma-precipitated migraine are reviewed. 
The development of a Norwegian pain questionnaire. The study was undertaken to develop a multidimensional measuring instrument for pain in the Norwegian language. The McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) was used as a model as it is a valid and reliable tool for pain measurement in English speaking countries. A series of steps were taken to develop a Norwegian pain questionnaire: (1) words describing pain were derived from 95 subjects (patients, students and health personnel); (2) 10 subjects allocated pain descriptors into groups; (3) 36 college student validated the word groupings; (4) 72 patients graded the words contained in each group according to intensity; and (5) the reliability of group items was tested. The study demonstrated that there are many descriptors of pain in the Norwegian language. The final version of the Norwegian pain questionnaire consisted of 106 pain descriptors divided into 18 groups. Validity of the classifications as well as reliability of the words was demonstrated. The actual value of the Norwegian pain questionnaire as a measuring instrument has not yet been documented. 
Ventricular arrhythmias. When should they be suppressed? Patients with asymptomatic ventricular premature complexes who do not have evidence of heart disease should not be treated with either class I or class III (Vaughan Williams) antiarrhythmic drugs. Patients who are symptomatic may be given beta blockers. In patients who have heart disease, a number of risk factors may play a part, and the decision regarding therapy is more difficult. However, symptomatic patients with either sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia must be treated with antiarrhythmic agents. In some patients, implantation of an automatic defibrillator may be necessary. 
Effect of atenolol on myocardial infarct expansion in a nonreperfused rat model. Acute myocardial infarct expansion is associated with a poor prognosis. This study was performed to assess potential beneficial effects of beta-blockers on inhibiting expansion. A pilot study showed that atenolol (10 mg/kg) achieved sustained beta-blockade in rats. In the main study, following left coronary ligation, 36 rats received atenolol and 18 rats received placebo daily for 7 days. Infarct size was similar in treated and control rats (25 +/- 13% versus 28 +/- 11%). Expansion grades and a quantitative index of expansion were similar for both groups. Infarct size and expansion index were significantly related, but linear regression lines were similar for treated and control rats. We conclude that atenolol has no significant effect on infarct expansion in this nonreperfused rat model. 
Rubber-specific IgE in children with spina bifida. We attempted to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of rubber-specific IgE in a prospective case control study of 32 preoperative children with spina bifida, compared with 45 outpatient controls and 35 age-matched preoperative controls without spina bifida. A latex-specific radioallergosorbent test was positive in 11 of the 32 spina bifida patients (34%), compared with 1 (2%) and 4 (11%) of the respective controls (p less than 0.05). Within the spina bifida group 5 of 11 antibody-positive patients had a history of rubber-associated, intraoperative or otherwise idiopathic allergic episodes and 1 of 21 antibody-negative patients gave such a history (p = 0.012). Children with spina bifida have a significantly greater likelihood than controls of having IgE specific for rubber antigens. In addition, the presence of rubber-specific IgE is associated with a higher frequency of rubber-associated, intraoperative or idiopathic allergic reactions. 
Thrombolytic and pharmacokinetic properties of a conjugate of recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator with a monoclonal antibody specific for cross-linked fibrin in a baboon venous thrombosis model Chemical conjugates between recombinant single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (rscu-PA) and a murine monoclonal antibody directed against fragment D-dimer of cross-linked human fibrin (MA-15C5), rscu-PA/MA-15C5, and between rscu-PA and a control monoclonal antibody (MA-1C8), rscu-PA/MA-1C8, were produced by cross-linking with N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP). In an in vitro system composed of a [125 I]fibrin-labeled baboon plasma clot immersed in autologous citrated plasma, dose- and time-dependent lysis was obtained with a ratio of the potencies of free and conjugated rscu-PA similar to that in human plasma: 50% lysis in 2 hours required 4.3 micrograms/ml rscu-PA, 1.0 microgram/ml urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) equivalent rscu-PA/MA-15C5, or 15 micrograms/ml u-PA equivalent rscu-PA/MA-1C8. The thrombolytic and pharmacokinetic properties of rscu-PA and of rscu-PA/MA-15C5 were compared in baboons with a 0.8-1.0 ml [125 I]fibrin-labeled autologous blood clot produced in a femoral vein. Continuous intravenous infusion of these compounds during a 2-hour period resulted in dose- and time-dependent lysis. The thrombolytic potency of rscu-PA/MA-15C5 was 3.0 +/- 0.5 times higher (50% lysis with 0.3 +/- 0.02 mg u-PA equivalent/kg body wt) than that of rscu-PA measured by ex vivo isotope recovery from the femoral vein segment (p less than 0.001) and was 2.7 +/- 0.5 times higher (50% lysis with 0.35 +/- 0.02 mg/kg rscu-PA/MA-15C5) by external radioisotope counting (p less than 0.001). A dose of 0.5 mg/kg of rscu-PA/MA-1C8 was much less active than rscu-PA. After the end of the infusion, u-PA-related antigen disappeared from plasma in a biphasic manner with an initial half-time of 2.7 +/- 0.5 for rscu-PA, 24 +/- 1.2 for rscu-PA/MA-15C5, and 21 +/- 0.5 minutes for rscu-PA/MA-1C8 with corresponding plasma clearances of 340 +/- 40, 20 +/- 3, and 24 +/- 2 ml/min, respectively. In conclusion, the increased thrombolytic potency of rscu-PA/MA-15C5 is the result of a reduction of the thrombolytic potency due to coupling of rscu-PA to the antibody molecule, which is counter-balanced by an enhancement of the thrombolytic potency due to fibrin targeting by the specific idiotype. 
Effect of acute hypoxia on respiration and brain stem blood flow in the piglet. Changes in local brain stem perfusion that alter extracellular fluid Pco2 and/or [H+] near central chemoreceptors may contribute to the decrease in respiration observed during hypoxia after peripheral chemoreceptor denervation and to the delayed decrease observed during hypoxia in the newborn. In this study, we measured the changes in respiration and brain stem blood flow (BBF) during 2-4 min of hypoxic hypoxia in both intact and denervated piglets and calculated the changes in brain stem Pco2 and [H+] that would be expected to occur as a result of the changes in BBF. All animals were anesthetized, spontaneously breathing, and between 2 and 7 days of age. Respiratory and other variables were measured before and during hypoxia in all animals, and BBF (microspheres) was measured in a subgroup of intact and denervated animals at 0, 30, and 260 s and at 0 and 80 s, respectively. During hypoxia, minute ventilation increased and then decreased (biphasic response) in the intact animals but decreased only in the denervated animals. BBF increased in a near linear fashion, and calculated brain stem extracellular fluid Pco2 and [H+] decreased over the first 80 s both before and after denervation. We speculate that a rapid increase in BBF during acute hypoxia decreases brain stem extracellular fluid Pco2 and [H+], which, in turn, negatively modulate the increase in respiratory drive produced by peripheral chemoreceptor input to the central respiratory generator. 
Embolic abscesses in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is an inherited disorder in which patients may have multiple telangiectases and arteriovenous fistulas in the skin and internal organs. Patients can suffer from a variety of serious clinical complications, including abscess formation. We report two patients in whom neurologic symptoms developed from embolic abscesses, one for whom this complication was fatal. The reported incidence and microbiologic features of this complication are similar to that of endocarditis in patients with valvular heart disease. We believe that patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia should receive similar antibacterial prophylaxis for procedures placing them at risk for bacteremia. 
Tumor necrosis factor (cachectin) in human visceral leishmaniasis. High tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) levels were present in the serum of 24 of 28 active visceral leishmaniasis (VL) patients (142.9 +/- 113.9 pg/ml, mean +/- SD), whereas levels were not elevated in 26 of 30 patients with cryptic leishmanial infection (16 asymptomatic, 4 with self-healing subclinical infection, and 10 posttreatment VL cases). Serum TNF alpha levels were also not elevated in 15 normal volunteers (11.3 +/- 15.6 pg/ml) and in 10 patients with tegumentary leishmaniasis (19.1 +/- 10.8 pg/ml). Leishmanial infection of human monocyte-derived macrophages enhanced the basal TNF alpha production by these cells, and this effect was further potentiated by treatment with recombinant interferon-gamma. After effective treatment of VL patients, serum TNF alpha levels dropped rapidly (129 +/- 112 vs. 9 +/- 13 pg/ml in 10 days), even before clinical parameters such as spleen size or parasitism, white blood cell count, or levels of hemoglobin returned to normal values. On the other hand, patients unresponsive to treatment remained with elevated levels (276 +/- 69 vs. 155 +/- 71 pg/ml in 10 days). Thus, serum TNF alpha levels in VL patients are a good parameter to monitor in determining host response to therapy. 
Intracranial arteriovenous fistula manifesting as progressive neurological deterioration in an infant: case report. This 1-year-old male infant had been diagnosed with cerebral degenerative disease because he developed psychomotor regression, and brain atrophy was demonstrated on computed tomography. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which suggested a cerebrovascular malformation. Cerebral angiography disclosed an arteriovenous fistula, fed by an anterior cerebral artery and directly draining into a cortical vein. The occlusion of the feeding artery was followed by a satisfactory recovery. The mechanism of the neurological symptoms in this patient is thought to be caused by a steal phenomenon and compression of the brain stem by venous engorgement in the posterior fossa. 
Use of the Souter-Strathclyde total elbow prosthesis in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty-three patients had thirty-four consecutive primary arthroplasties, with use of the Souter-Strathclyde cemented unconstrained prosthesis, for severe rheumatoid arthritis of the elbow. The minimum duration of follow-up for inclusion in the study was two years. Three patients died. Four arthroplasties were revised: three, because of irreducible dislocation immediately after the operation and one, because of loosening without infection. One prosthesis was removed because of a late deep infection. In most of the remaining twenty-five patients (twenty-six arthroplasties), who had an average duration of follow-up of four years (range, two to eight years), pain was markedly less or had resolved completely, and the function of the elbow was greatly improved. 
Utility of a transdermal delivery system for antihypertensive therapy. Part 1. A retrospective evaluation of patient-level Medicaid claims data from two states was undertaken to discern the fiscal utility of transdermally delivered clonidine versus both the oral formulation of clonidine and oral formulations of eight other antihypertensive agents. In the first phase of our two-part study, we compared paid claims data (n = 1,135) from Florida for transdermal and oral clonidine. Multivariate regression analysis was used to evaluate the incremental impact of six variables on health-care expenditures in the first year after patients were given a diagnosis of hypertension. These variables were: age, gender, prior utilization of medical services, regimen complexity, and dosage formulation. Patients prescribed transdermal clonidine experienced a significant (p less than or equal to 0.001) increase in prescription expenditures and significant reductions in the use of physician (p less than or equal to 0.05), laboratory (p less than or equal to 0.10), and hospital (p less than or equal to 0.05) services. Moreover, savings were maximized (p less than or equal to 0.001) where multi-drug regimens incorporated the transdermal delivery system. In the second phase of our study we compared paid claims data (n = 8,894) from South Carolina for transdermal clonidine and for nine oral antihypertensive agents: atenolol, captopril, clonidine, diltiazem, enalapril, metoprolol, prazosin, terazosin, and verapamil-SR. Once again, regression analysis was used, this time to evaluate the incremental impact of five variables on health-care expenditures in the first year post diagnosis: age, gender, prior utilization of medical services, regimen complexity, and Medication Possession Ratio (MPR), an index of compliance. The data from part 2 of our study revealed that patients assigned a b.i.d. oral antihypertensive agent experienced a significant reduction (p less than or equal to 0.05) in MPR and a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in health-care expenditures when compared to patients prescribed the transdermal delivery system and to patients prescribed once-daily oral medications. These data confirm previous findings concerning the impact of complicated dosing regimens on compliance in hypertensive patients. In this two-part paper we report the data from both phases of our study. 
The role of intraluminal radiotherapy and concurrent 5-fluorouracil infusion in the management of carcinoma esophagus: a pilot study. Fifty patients with carcinoma of the esophagus were entered in a randomized pilot study to test the efficacy of intraluminal radiotherapy (ILRT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion. The median age was 65 years, with 80% having middle third lesions; in 62%, the lesions were longer than 5 cm. After external beam therapy of 50 Gy in 5 weeks, patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy. Significant improvement in dysphagia was recorded in 76% patients with complete response in 47 cases ranging from 6 to 27 months. The overall survival at 2 years was 15% with ILRT alone versus 22% with ILRT plus 5-FU infusion. 
High-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of experimental liver cancer. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) was used to treat Morris rat hepatoma 3924A implanted in the liver. Treatment was administered with a lens-focused 4-MHz transducer that created a focused beam of 550 W/cm2 at peak intensity. One hundred twelve rats with liver tumors were divided into two groups of 56 each. Group 1 received HIFU therapy while group 2 (the control group) did not. All rats were killed immediately or 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days after treatment. Eight rats in each group were killed at each interval for pathologic and biochemical studies. Significant inhibition of the tumor growth was seen in the HIFU-treated group, with tumor growth inhibition rates of 65.4% to 93.1% from the third to the 28th day after treatment. Ultrasound-treated tumors showed direct thermal cytotoxic necrosis and fibrosis. An additional 56 ACl rats with liver tumors were divided into four groups of 14 each. Group 1 received doxorubicin hydrochloride intraperitoneally and HIFU therapy; group 2, HIFU therapy; group 3, doxorubicin hydrochloride; and group 4 (the control group), neither HIFU nor doxorubicin hydrochloride. Significantly improved survival rates were noted in HIFU-treated animals (groups 1 and 2) compared with those of groups 3 and 4. These data suggest that HIFU may be a useful method for local treatment of hepatic tumors. 
Liver tumor promotion: effect of phenobarbital on EGF and protein kinase C signal transduction and transforming growth factor-beta 1 expression. Phenobarbital (PB) added to the medium of cultured rat hepatocytes alters epidermal growth factor (EGF) dependent mitogenesis in a biphasic manner; PB concentrations less than 1.5 mM are growth stimulatory but higher concentrations significantly inhibit normal hepatocyte proliferation. In contrast, the growth of putative preneoplastic cells is inhibited less by high concentrations of PB. Mechanistic studies designed to test the ability of PB to alter the early events of EGF signal transduction demonstrate that PB neither competes with EGF for binding to the EGF receptor nor alters EGF-induced receptor down-regulation. However, pretreatment with PB (greater than 1 mM) results in a transient inhibition of EGF binding to hepatocytes. The kinetics of this effect are similar to those obtained when hepatocytes are exposed to the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), a skin tumor promoter and activator of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C. However, several observations suggest that distinct mechanisms mediate the responses to these two tumor promoters. First, the inhibitory effects of PB and TPA on EGF binding are additive. Also down-regulation of EGF receptors in response to TPA occurs with hepatocytes, A431 epidermal carcinoma cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and rat liver epithelial cells, but only hepatocytes are sensitive to PB. Furthermore, translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane occurs in hepatocytes treated with TPA but not in those treated with PB. The chronic treatment of rats with PB further sensitizes hepatocytes to EGF receptor down-regulation by in vitro PB while desensitizing them to EGF receptor down-regulation by TPA. This latter effect is correlated with a decreased ability of TPA to induce translocation of protein kinase C to the membrane. PB significantly increases the intracellular concentration of TGF-beta 1 in periportal hepatocytes but not in putative preneoplastic cells. TGF-beta 1 may therefore have an important function in regulating early stages of cell cycle progression in proliferating hepatocytes. 
Otologic sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis: a survey of 164 consecutive cases with a follow-up of 94 survivors. As part of a comprehensive study on sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis, 94 of 111 consecutive survivors were re-examined 4 to 16 years after discharge. Twenty-three patients had otological sequelae after pneumococcal meningitis. In these patients, 17 had hearing losses, 7 had tinnitus, 9 had vertigo, 13 had vestibular areflexia, 4 had loss of smell, and 3 had loss of taste. Among the patients with hearing loss, 4 were bilaterally deaf, 6 were unilaterally deaf, and 2 had mild and 5 had slight hearing losses. From correlations with extensive data from the medical records, preadmission antibiotic treatment appeared to protect from acousticovestibular damage. Purulent otitis media and otosurgical intervention did not correlate to the fatality rate or the development of sequelae. Acute purulent otitis media appeared as a concomitant manifestation, rather than the focus of pneumococcal meningitis. 
Large cysts of the pineal gland: report of two cases. Two cases of large, nontumorous cysts of the pineal gland are reported, the histopathology of which was confirmed using surgically resected specimens. Both patients were middle-aged, and the pineal cysts were found incidentally. The histopathological findings in the two cases were strikingly similar to each other and were characterized by the following points: 1) the cyst wall typically consisted of three layers, namely, collagenous fibers, glia-like cells, and normal pineal cells; 2) the cyst wall was relatively thin, approximately 100 to 300 microns in thickness; and 3) deposits of calcification almost always existed on the side of the layer of collagenous fiber. Because these findings are clearly different from those previously reported, large benign cysts of the pineal gland, or at least some of them, may constitute a new pathological entity. It is important to consider this possible pathological diagnosis when dealing with pineal cysts. 
Value of ultrasound in differentiating causes of persistent vomiting in infants. A prospective study of abdominal ultrasound was undertaken in 100 consecutive infants who presented with a history of persistent vomiting aged 5 to 90 days. Each infant had a 'test feed' followed by an ultrasonographic scan of the pylorus at the cotside. On test feeding a palpable tumour was evident in 38 infants. On real time ultrasound using the criteria for diagnosing pyloric stenosis, these 38 infants as well as six others were documented as having pyloric stenosis. In the other 56 patients the vomiting settled in six and a barium examination was performed on the remaining 50. This confirmed gastro-oesophageal reflux in 46, two of whom had an associated hiatus hernia, one with a duodenal malrotation, and three were reported as normal. Ultrasound of the abdomen is an accurate, reliable, and rapid screening method to differentiate the causes of severe vomiting in infancy. 
Use of intravenous immunoglobulin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A brief review. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disorder with multiple defects leading to an increased susceptibility to infection. Hypogammaglobulinemia is present in about 20% to 70% of patients with CLL. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) supplementation (400 mg/kg body weight every 3 weeks) prevented bacterial infections in these patients. An ongoing study is being conducted to compare doses of 250 mg/kg/mo with those of 500 mg/kg/mo in 36 patients included so far. As of this writing, the rate of infection in the two treatment groups was not significantly different, and no substantial loss of protection against bacterial infection was found in the lower-dose group. It seems likely that the lower dose is almost as effective as the standard therapy. If this is so, cost savings would be substantial. 
The role of the pathologist in the management of breast cancer. The pathologist is a consultant in breast cancer management whose responsibility is to establish the histologic diagnosis of cancer as well as its anatomic extent once sufficient tissue has been provided. The consultation also provides data that may be used to aid in selecting primary or adjuvant therapy, evaluating new therapies, estimating prognosis, and assessing outcome. Examples of such data are the TNM histopathologic classification of the anatomic extent of the cancer used for the stage grouping (T = the extent of the primary tumor, N = the absence or presence and extent of regional lymph node metastasis, and M = the absence or presence of distant metastasis); tumor size, histologic type, and histologic and/or nuclear grade; assessment of blood vessel and lymphatic vessel invasion; analysis of steroid receptors, and other special studies as appropriate. 
Perinatal mycoplasmal infections. Maternal infections are known to play a major role in perinatal morbidity and mortality. Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma hominis are sexually transmissible microorganisms associated with a number of pathologic conditions in the pregnant woman including chorioamnionitis and postpartum fever. They are rapidly gaining recognition as significant causes of perinatal infection, especially in infants born prematurely. This review summarizes current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, pathology, disease spectrum, and clinical manifestations of mycoplasmal and ureaplasmal perinatal infections and presents guidelines for proper diagnosis and treatment. 
Dying of cancer: a patient's recollection of her illness and of her doctors. A personal account of a patient's long ordeal with cancer of the tongue is presented. The explicit journal begins at the time that a lesion was first detected and ends approximately 4 1/2 years later, just 8 1/2 months before the patient's death from local disease. Important principles of clinical diagnosis and patient management, vividly underscored by this case, are reviewed and discussed. 
Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic neoplasms. In closing, it is important to note that the indications for liver transplantation are not static but rather are remarkably dynamic and capable of change over time. Thus yesterday's major indications can become relative contraindications, while yesterday's absolute contraindications have become today's nuisances. The goal for physicians who care for individuals with problems such as alcoholic liver disease, viral hepatitis, and hepatic cancer should be to develop new strategies of care that will ultimately eliminate these diseases as problems, rather than eliminating individuals with such health problems from currently available health options. In other words, physicians who accept the responsibility for a patient's life should be searching for the best form of therapy available for their patient rather than examining the reasons that exist for limiting one's choice in health care. 
Chorea-acanthocytosis: abnormal composition of covalently bound fatty acids of erythrocyte membrane proteins. Phospholipid class, peak profile of each phospholipid class, loosely bound fatty acids, covalently (tightly) bound fatty acids of the erythrocyte membranes, and plasma fatty acids were investigated using high-performance liquid chromatography in six patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and 14 age- and sex-matched normal control subjects. Additionally, six patients with Huntington's disease were included as disease control subjects in the study of covalently bound fatty acids. Study of covalently (tightly) bound fatty acids in erythrocyte membrane proteins after alkaline hydrolysis, hitherto undescribed in chorea-acanthocytosis, revealed that palmitic acid (C16:0) was significantly increased and stearic acid (C18:0) was decreased in the patients with chorea-acanthocytosis. Analyses for total covalently bound fatty acids disclosed that palmitic and docosahexaenoic (C22:6) acids were increased and stearic acid was decreased in chorea-acanthocytosis. Phospholipid class (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylserine) and peak profile of each phospholipid class from the erythrocyte membranes did not differ between the patients with chorea-acanthocytosis and the control subjects. Of the loosely bound fatty acids, linoleic acid (C18:2) was significantly decreased in those with chorea-acanthocytosis, which seemed to be nonspecific. 
Observations on massive retrieved human allografts. Radiographic and histological studies of sixteen massive retrieved human allografts were carried out after the allografts had been in situ for four to sixty-five months. The studies demonstrated that union between the allograft and the host took place slowly at cortical-cortical junctions by the formation of an external callus derived from the cortex of the host, and it took place more rapidly at cancellous-cancellous junctions by internal callus advancing from the host into the allograft. Internal repair took place very slowly, was confined to the superficial surface and the ends of the graft, and had involved only 20 per cent of the graft by five years. The deep unrepaired portions of the graft retained their architecture, and where bone cement had been used to fix a prosthetic stem or an intramedullary rod to the allograft, there was no evidence of resorption of bone or loosening of the device. Soft tissues of the host became attached to the graft by deposition of a thin seam of new bone on the surface of the graft. A previous fracture of two grafts had healed before the time of retrieval. Analysis of the articular cartilage revealed no evidence that any chondrocytes had survived, even when the graft had been cryoprotected before it was preserved by freezing. The necrotic cartilage functioned well for as long as five years, and as it degenerated, it was covered by a pannus of fibrovascular reparative tissue. Two allografts that had been removed because of rejection were surrounded by an envelope of chronic inflammatory tissue that prevented union, adherence of soft tissue, and internal repair. Internal repair was more advanced about sites of fracture and adjacent to recurrent tumors than in other portions of the graft. These findings suggest that large frozen allografts in humans are osteoconductive rather than osteoinductive. 
Improved speed and accuracy of calculations with a programmable calculator in pediatric emergency scenarios. Both mathematical and selection errors may occur when ordering drug or fluid therapy in a busy emergency department. In an attempt to improve the speed and accuracy of such calculations, we programmed a hand-held calculator to assist in drug and intravenous fluid therapy dosages and rates for three emergency situations: diabetic ketoacidosis, asthma, and asystole. Performance by 58 subjects at various levels of training was compared when using either the programmable calculator or standard materials and methods. When standard methods were used, an average of 30.6 minutes was needed to complete the three scenarios, with an accuracy of 73%; by contrast, use of programmable calculator resulted in a significant decline in time needed to calculate doses (an average of only 8.5 minutes), with an improved accuracy of 98%. The use of a programmable calculator can result in a significant improvement in both speed and accuracy of drug and fluid selection and dosage and rate calculations, regardless of the level of the subject's medical training. 
Antiarrhythmic actions of tocainide in canine models of previous myocardial infarction. The antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory efficacies of the class IB antiarrhythmic agent tocainide were characterized in conscious dogs in the early subacute phase of anterior myocardial infarction (48 hours after infarction) and in anesthetized dogs with ventricular tachyarrhythmias that were inducible by programmed stimulation more chronically (10.8 +/- 1.0 days) after anterior myocardial infarction. The frequency of spontaneous premature ventricular complexes in the early subacute postinfarction phase was reduced significantly from 48.4% +/- 10.5% to 8.2% +/- 5.0% of total complexes (p less than 0.01) by the cumulative intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg tocainide. In the late postinfarction setting, the intravenous administration of tocainide (6 mg/kg intravenous loading dose + 100 micrograms/kg/min intravenous maintenance infusion) suppressed the initiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias by programmed stimulation in 5 of 12 animals that were tested and slowed the rate of tachycardia in 3 additional animals. However, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation and of the total number of arrhythmia-related deaths that resulted from the occurrence of a secondary ischemic insult in the presence of previous infarction did not differ significantly between tocainide (75% [9 of 12] incidence of both ventricular fibrillation and of total number of arrhythmia-related deaths) and saline-vehicle control groups (80% [12 of 15] incidence of ventricular fibrillation; 93.3% [14 of 15] incidence of total number of arrhythmia-related deaths). These findings suggest that although class I agents such as tocainide may be efficacious in the suppression of spontaneous premature ventricular complexes and ventricular arrhythmias immediately after myocardial infarction, they may be of limited value in the prevention of malignant ischemic arrhythmias that occur later after myocardial infarction. 
Colonic fermentation of dietary fibre to short chain fatty acids in patients with adenomatous polyps and colonic cancer. Short chain (C2-C6) fatty acids are produced in the colon through bacterial fermentation of mainly dietary fibre. Butyrate (C4) possesses antineoplastic effects on human colon carcinoma cells, and epidemiological studies indicate that high fibre diets may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. The role of dietary fibre during colorectal carcinogenesis might therefore be related to its fermentation to butyrate. Faecal concentrations of total short chain fatty acids and concentrations and ratios of the individual C2-C6 fatty acids did not differ between 16 healthy controls, 17 patients with colonic adenomas, and 17 patients with colonic cancer. Comparison of the molar production velocities (mmol/l.hour) of total and individual short chain fatty acids from glucose, ispagula, wheat bran, and albumin in six and 24 hour faecal incubations showed no differences. The ratio of butyrate production to total short chain fatty acid production from fibre, however, was reduced in patients with colonic cancer and adenomas compared with healthy controls (ispagula, six hours: 6.4, 7.6, and 11.5% respectively, p = 0.005 and 24 hour: 9.1, 9.9, and 15.4%, p = 0.002; wheat bran, six hours: 9.9, 10.2, and 14.7% respectively, p = 0.06 and 24 hours: 15.1, 16.8, and 21.0%, p = 0.01). It may be that the low ratios of colonic butyrate formation combined with low fibre diets increase the risk of colonic neoplasia. 
Left ventricular function and wall thickness in long-term insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: an echocardiographic study. Left ventricular function and wall thickness were evaluated in 111 type I diabetic subjects (mean age 25.5 +/- 9 years, mean duration of diabetes 13.4 +/- 6.2 years), using 2-D-derived M-mode echocardiography. Patients were carefully selected for the absence of major coronary risk factors or manifest cardiac disorders, and compared with 91 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Fractional shortening and the maximal velocity of cirumferential fibre shortening did not differ significantly between the two groups. Furthermore, no differences were found in the diastolic functional parameter of velocity of circumferential fibre extension. Posterior wall thickness was significantly increased in the diabetic patients compared to the controls (9.5 +/- 1.8 mm vs. 8.4 +/- 1.3 mm. P less than 0.01). As the thickness of the interventricular septum was also moderately increased (9.2 +/- 2.2 mm vs. 8.9 +/- 1.7 mm, NS), these findings provide evidence for an early structural change of the myocardium in young diabetic patients without clinically relevant functional consequences. 
Human high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen mimicry by mouse antiidiotypic monoclonal antibody MK2-23. Characterization of the immunogenicity in syngeneic hosts. Previous studies have shown that the mouse antiidiotypic mAb MK2-23 elicited with the syngeneic anti-human high molecular weight melanoma-associated Ag (HMW-MAA) mAb 763.74 elicits anti-HMW-MAA antibodies in syngeneic hosts and in patients with melanoma. The present investigation has characterized the fine specificity of antibodies elicited by mAb MK2-23, tested its ability to induce delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells and analyzed the variables that influence the immunogenicity of mAb MK2-23. The anti-HMW-MAA antibodies elicited by mAb MK2-23 recognize the same population of molecules recognized by mAb 763.74, react with the same (or spatially close) determinant(s) and express the idiotopes recognized by mAb MK2-23 in their Ag-combining sites. The antiidiotypic antibodies that bind to HMW-MAA have a lower titer than those that do not. These results in conjunction with those obtained in mice using a suboptimal immunization schedule suggest that the idiotope(s) that mimic(s) the mAb 763.74-defined determinant of the HMW-MAA is less immunogenic than those that do not. mAb MK2-23 induces a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to HMW-MAA-bearing melanoma cells. Therefore, mAb MK2-23 represents the first example of mouse antiidiotypic mAb that induces a cellular and humoral immunity to a human tumor-associated Ag (TAA), because the previously described mouse antiidiotypic mAb that bear the mirror image of TAA have been shown to induce only humoral anti-TAA immunity. The immunogenicity of mAb MK2-23 is markedly enhanced by its conjugation to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and its administration with FA. Furthermore, the number of immunizations and the doses of mAb MK2-23 injected influence its immunogenicity, although to a lower extent than conjugation to a carrier and mixing with an adjuvant. The information derived from the present investigation represents a useful background to optimize the immunization schedule with mAb MK2-23 in patients with melanoma. 
Patterns of postictal cerebral blood flow in temporal lobe epilepsy: qualitative and quantitative analysis. We used single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) to study postictal cerebral blood flow (CBF) in 51 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. There were 78 seizures studied, 77 by early postictal injection of Tc-99m HMPAO (delay from seizure onset = 4.3 +/- 4.5 min) and one by ictal injection. Increased focal temporal lobe uptake, predominantly confined to the anteromesial region, was present in 83% and declined rapidly over 5 minutes. Reduced activity in the lateral temporal lobe accompanied the mesial increase in 80% of studies, extending over much of the ipsilateral hemisphere and closely associated with the degree and extent of postictal EEG slow waves. These patterns enabled correct seizure localization by blinded analysis in 69% (31/45) of the patients with a unilateral EEG focus. The remainder showed bilateral or no changes. One of six patients with bitemporal EEG foci had unilateral perfusion changes. The positive predictive value for the correct localization of a unilateral focus by postictal SPECT was 97% (31/32). Postictal CBF imaging with SPECT can be used to support noninvasive electrographic localization and may decrease the need for invasive electrode studies. 
Serum-erythropoietin concentration during acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Reduced oxygen tension is regarded as the primary physiologic signal for the production of erythropoietin (EPO). There is little information available about early changes of EPO production in man due to severe hypoxia. The purpose of the present study was to examine the time course of EPO in serum of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE). In 29 patients (seventy-five +/- six years, mean age +/- SEM) who were hospitalized within two hours after onset of symptoms of ACPE, serum EPO concentrations were monitored for up to seventy-two hours. At the moment of admission all patients showed significantly increased EPO concentrations of 121 +/- 64 mU/mL (mean +/- SEM) compared with a healthy population (15-35 mU/mL). Twenty-three patients who recovered within thirty minutes (group A) exhibited a quick return of their EPO serum levels to normal. The remaining 6 patients (group B) had a protracted clinical course and their EPO concentration showed a further increase up to the end of the observation period. The comparative monitoring of concentrations of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin III, C-reactive protein, fibronectin, hapotoglobin, and transerrin in serum and plasma revealed no significant changes. Thus a major contribution of fluid shifts into or from the intravascular compartment to the observed changes in EPO concentration seems to be unlikely. The data suggest that the production and release of EPO in the kidneys due to altered oxygen delivery is a fast-responding mechanism. 
Coronary angioplasty using new 6 French guiding catheters. Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was performed with specially constructed 6-French guiding catheters with an internal lumen of 0.051 inches. In 154 patients these guiding catheters were used in a variety of configurations in conjunction with miniature balloon-on-a-wire dilatation catheters in 1.5 to 3.5 mm sizes to perform PTCA. Overall patient success was 94%. PTCA was attempted in 24 totally occluded arteries with a success rate of 83% and 174 stenoses with a success rate of 97%. 6 French guiding catheters can be used to successfully perform PTCA. 
Validity of diurnal sleep recording in the diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome. Two polysomnographic studies were performed in 35 subjects who had a clinical suspicion of sleep apnea syndrome: one study was done at night (N) (from 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.) and the other during the day (D) starting after lunch (from noon to 5:00 p.m.). N and D sleep studies were performed in random order at a minimal interval of 36 h. No treatment (drug, CPAP) was initiated between the two studies. Both studies included the recording of sleep stages (EEG, EOG, EMG), nasal and mouth flows, thoracoabdominal movements, electrocardiogram, and SaO2 (ear oximetry). D sleep was present in all but one subject. As expected, the total sleep time (TST) was significantly shorter during the D than during the N study (2.6 +/- 0.2 and 6.2 +/- 0.2 h, respectively, mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.001, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test). Stages III-IV and REM were significantly less represented during the D (13.1 +/- 2.4 and 7.7 +/- 1.3%, respectively) than during the N study (18.5 +/- 1.7 and 15.3 +/- 0.8%, p less than or equal to 0.005). From the results of the N study, the diagnosis of sleep apnea syndrome (apnea index greater than 5 and/or apnea + hypopnea index greater than 10) was made in 25 patients, and it was confirmed by the same criteria in 22 by the D sleep recording. There was a significant correlation between the N and D values for these indices (r greater than or equal to 0.9, p less than 0.0001). 
Role of sinus node artery disease in sick sinus syndrome in inferior wall acute myocardial infarction. This study was undertaken to evaluate a possible role of sinus node (SN) artery disease in the pathogenesis of sick sinus syndrome (SSS) in patients with an inferior wall acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Coronary angiography and electrophysiologic studies of the SN, both in the basal state and after pharmacologic autonomic blockade, were performed in 23 study patients (mean age 60 years) with SSS and a previous inferior wall AMI and in another 23 control patients (mean age 57 years) with normal sinus rate and a previous inferior AMI. Stenosis of the SN artery (or that proximal to its origin) greater than 50% was present in 13 study patients (56%) and in 8 control patients (34%) (p less than 0.05). In the study group, the intrinsic heart rate was abnormal in 5 of the 6 patients (83%) with severe SN artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 75% narrowing), in 3 of the 7 (43%) with moderate stenosis (50 to 75% narrowing) and in 3 of the 10 (30%) with insignificant stenosis (less than 50% narrowing). In the study group, the correlation between the SN measures (heart rate, corrected SN recovery time and sinoatrial conduction time) and the severity of SN artery stenosis was good after autonomic blockade (r between 0.59 and 0.64) and poor in the basal state. These data provide evidence for a role of SN artery disease in the pathogenesis of SSS in patients with an inferior wall AMI. 
Peripheral neuropathy in cold agglutinin disease. Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) characteristically presents as anemia and cold-induced rash. We report a man with purpura, anemia, cold agglutinins, and a sensory-autonomic polyneuropathy. Treatment with corticosteroids and plasma exchange resulted in resolution of the anemia and polyneuropathy. We propose that CAD may be associated with a reversible sensory-autonomic neuropathy in the absence of cryoglobulinemia. Although unsupported by pathologic findings, pathogenetic hypotheses for the neuropathy in CAD are similar to those proposed for cryoglobulinemic neuropathy. 
Inverted papilloma of the nose and paranasal sinuses: a study of 67 patients. Retrospectively, 67 patients with inverted nasal papillomas were studied. In 12, the lesions were localized exclusively on the nasal septum. In 55, the lesion involved the lateral wall and/or the paranasal sinuses. There was a male predominance of 3:1. After histological revision the most dominating epithelial type was found to be transitional. Inverted papilloma was in one patient associated with squamous cell carcinoma. Ten per cent suffered recurrences from 6 to 37 months after the primary surgical procedure. We found that limited septal lesions could be managed by an intranasal procedure but lateral rhinotomy is recommended as the procedure of choice in the treatment of inverted papilloma of the lateral wall. 
Interferon-induced chronic active hepatitis? A 54-year-old man with chronic B hepatitis was treated with interferon alfa. Despite resolution of the hepatitis B viral infection, he experienced severe jaundice, ascites, and encephalopathy. Further work-up showed hyperglobulinemia, chiefly immunoglobulin G, and positive smooth muscle and anti-nuclear antibodies. Because of these "autoimmune" features, the patient was treated with prednisone. One month later, a significant clinical and biochemical improvement was observed. A possible autoimmune mechanism induced by interferon alfa is proposed as the cause for the perpetuation of the necroinflammatory activity. 
Microvascular angina. Cardiovascular investigations regarding pathophysiology and management. A significant minority of patients with chest pain who undergo cardiac catheterization are found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries. Over the past 25 years, several studies have shown that a subset have demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow and cardiac function; however, only a minority of these patients have convincing evidence for myocardial ischemia during stress, and alternative mechanisms have been explored to explain the frequent and debilitating symptoms of pain experienced by the majority of these patients undergoing study. Abnormal visceral nociception appears to be a fundamental abnormality in this population, whether or not demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow or cardiac function can be demonstrated. 
Neobladder construction using completely detubularized sigmoid colon after radical cystoprostatectomy. To improve the quality of life of the patient we used completely detubularized sigmoid colon for bladder reconstruction along with radical cystoprostatectomy in 6 men with invasive bladder cancer. Followup was 8 to 20 months. Postoperatively, all of the patients were continent during the day but only 4 (66.7%) were continent at night, although they had to awaken twice to remain dry. Neocystourethroscopy in 4 of the 6 patients revealed no tumor and no stricture at the urethrocolonic anastomosis. However, a stone in the neobladder was found in 1 patients. Urodynamic study of the neobladder showed a low pressure (mean 16.7 cm. water) at the filling phase of water cystometry and an adequate maximal urethral closure pressure (mean 52.0 cm. water) and functional profile length (mean 3.8 cm.). The uroflow rate in all patients was good (1 patient even had a maximal uroflow rate of 31 ml. per second). There was no reflux in any patient. One patient had intestinal obstruction 5 months postoperatively and died 5 months later of widespread metastasis. The remaining 5 patients are alive with a satisfactory quality of life. In conclusion, use of completely detubularized sigmoid colon may be an ideal operation for neobladder construction after radical cystoprostatectomy. 
Hemodynamic and clinical benefits with intravenous milrinone in severe chronic heart failure: results of a multicenter study in the United States. The response of patients with chronic severe heart failure to extended infusions (greater than or equal to 48 hours) of milrinone was evaluated in a multicenter, baseline-controlled, phase III efficacy and safety trial in 189 patients in the United States. Milrinone was given as loading and maintenance infusions according to one of four dose regimens. An effective response was defined as greater than or equal to 20% increases in cardiac index or decreases in pulmonary wedge pressure. All loading doses (range, 37.5 to 75 micrograms/kg/10 min) were effective short term, and maximum response occurred at 15 minutes. For the three effective regimens, cardiac index increased initially (at 15 minutes) by 24% to 42%, and pulmonary wedge pressure decreased by 24% to 33%. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 15% to 31%. The maximal acute response was effective in 99% of individual patients. During maintenance therapy, effective responses were seen at infusion doses of 0.375, 0.50, and 0.75 micrograms/kg/min, whereas an infusion of 0.25 micrograms/kg/min was ineffective. During 2 days of maintenance therapy, cardiac index remained augmented by 34% to 39% for the low and intermediate doses and by 44% to 73% for the high-dose infusion regimen. Pulmonary wedge pressure decreased an average of 18% on day 1 and 30% on day 2. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 20% to 25%, and stroke work index was augmented by 21% to 58%. Symptomatic improvement was common during intravenous milrinone therapy for symptoms of dyspnea (61% response), orthopnea (63%), edema (62%), and fatigue (40%). Improvement occurred more frequently in those with worse baseline functional indexes and in those with greater hemodynamic responses to therapy. Safety and tolerance were exceptionally good for these patients with advanced heart failure. 
Indicators of prognosis after hepatic resection for colorectal secondaries. From 1960 to 1988, 266 patients underwent resection of colorectal secondaries to the liver with curative intent. All patients were followed until April 1, 1990, or death, with a median follow-up time of 52 months. Nine patients with minimal macroscopic residual disease and 38 patients with all gross tumor removed but positive margins showed a poor prognosis with a median survival time of 13.3 months, the longest being 42 months. Of the 219 patients having potentially curative resection, 12 patients died postoperatively (5.5%). Actuarial 5, 10 and 20-year survival for the remaining 207 patients was 39%, 28%, and 18%, respectively. At April 1, 1990, 77 patients were alive with no evidence of disease for up to 24 years, and 12 patients had died without recurrence. The following factors were associated with less favorable crude survival: presence and extent of mesenteric lymph node involvement (p = 0.0003), grade III/IV primary tumor (p = 0.035), synchronous diagnosis of metastases (p = 0.017), satellite metastases (p = 0.0003), limited resection margins (p = 0.019), and nonanatomic procedures (p = 0.013). With respect to disease-free survival, grading of the primary (p = 0.055) and the extent of clear margins (p = 0.019) failed to achieve statistical significance. Two other criteria are commonly recommended as absolute contraindications to hepatic resection: extrahepatic disease and the presence of four or more independent metastases. A radical excision of all detectable disease may rarely be possible in these circumstances. Nevertheless, within the curative settings, no significant predictive value regarding either overall or disease-free survival was found in this series. Three corresponding "high risk" patients are alive without disease at 5 to 11 years from hepatic resection. These patients with more advanced intrahepatic or concomitant limited extrahepatic disease require a particularly thorough diagnostic work up. As no superior therapeutic alternative is currently available, an aggressive surgical approach may occasionally be justified, and may, in a small portion, result in definite tumor control. 
Dysplasia epiphysealis capitis femoris. Meyer's dysplasia. We made a prospective longitudinal clinical and radiological study of 18 children diagnosed as having dysplasia epiphysealis capitis femoris. Half the cases were bilateral. Boys were affected five times more often than girls. There were no symptoms or clinical signs in most but some of the bilateral cases had an inconsistent waddling gait. The imaging studies suggest that the cartilaginous proximal femoral epiphysis is hypoplastic, with delayed appearance of single or multiple ossification centres. Progressive improvement occurred and at an average age of five years and six months, there was complete fusion of all the ossific nuclei and normal density and texture of the epiphyseal bone. The end result was a round epiphysis with a slightly diminished height. The dysplasia is attributed to focal hypoplasia of the proximal femoral epiphysis. 
Cardiovascular disease, motor-vehicle-related injury, and use of clinical preventive services--behavioral risk factor surveillance system, 1989. CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a state-based method for risk factor surveillance, was implemented in 1984. By 1989, 39 states and the District of Columbia participated in monthly random-digit-dialed telephone interviews of adults greater than or equal to 18 years of age (1). A total of 66,867 interviews were conducted in 1989; state-specific sample sizes ranged from 1171 to 3415 (mean: 1672). This report summarizes results of the 1989 survey and compares them with 1988 for risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, motor-vehicle-related injury, and use of clinical preventive services. 
Platelet-activating effect of low-density lipoprotein and its reversal by isradipine. The effect of the calcium antagonist isradipine on platelet aggregation (induced ex vivo by serotonin and low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) was studied in 17 nonsmoking patients with essential hypertension. Platelet aggregation was measured after a four-week placebo period, and after four and 12 weeks of treatment with isradipine. Both the serotonin-induced and the LDL plus serotonin-induced platelet aggregation were significantly decreased after four weeks of isradipine treatment compared with placebo. The amplifying effect of LDL on the serotonin-induced aggregation was significant both after placebo and after active treatment with isradipine. A further decrease in platelet aggregation induced by LDL plus serotonin was observed after 12 weeks of isradipine treatment so that no amplification of serotonin-induced aggregation by LDL could be detected. In conclusion, it appears that treatment with isradipine restores the impaired platelet response to serotonin and LDL in hypertensive patients. The inhibition of this response may represent a cellular mechanism of thrombovascular protection. 
Treatment of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure caused by chlorine exposure [published erratum appears in Pediatr Emerg Care 1991 Jun;7(3):151] Chlorine inhalation may rapidly cause pulmonary edema, leading to acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. We report a 12 year old with acute respiratory failure from inhalation injury after he accidentally dropped chlorine tablets into a swimming pool. Supplemental oxygen alone failed to provide adequate arterial oxygenation. We administered positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) in the emergency department, resulting in markedly improved oxygenation. Early institution of PEEP should be considered in patients with chlorine poisoning when supplemental oxygen alone is insufficient. 
Abnormally high level of C4b binding protein and deficiency of free fraction of protein S in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and recurrent thromboses. A patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and numerous thrombotic accidents was found to have a deficiency of the free fraction of protein S, most likely due to an abnormally high level of C4b binding protein. These abnormalities, unique in comparison to 4 other patients with hypercoagulation states, were partially corrected with cyclophosphamide. There was no evidence of a consumption of complement components. The interactions between the hemostasis system and the complement cascade are discussed. 
Binding of the adenovirus VAI RNA to the interferon-induced 68-kDa protein kinase correlates with function. In human cells infected with adenovirus, the virus-associated RNA VAI blocks the activation of the interferon-induced double-stranded-RNA-dependent 68-kDa protein kinase (p68) and maintains normal levels of protein synthesis at late times after infection. VAI antagonizes the kinase activity by binding to p68. The structure of VAI consists of two long, base-paired stems connected by a complex short stem-loop structure. Previous work using a series of adenovirus mutants showed that the structural determinants of the VAI RNA that are essential for function reside in the central complex short stem-loop structure and adjacent base-paired regions (functional domain); the long duplex regions were found to be dispensable for function. To determine whether binding of VAI to p68 correlates with function and whether the structural determinants that are essential for function are also essential for binding, we studied the interaction of wild-type and several mutant VAI RNAs with p68 in whole cells. The p68-VAI complexes from mutant- and wild-type-infected cells were immunoprecipitated by an anti-p68 monoclonal antibody. The mutant RNAs that functioned efficiently in the cells bound to p68 efficiently in the cells, whereas functionally impaired mutants failed to bind to p68, indicating that the binding of the VAI RNA to p68 correlates well with function. In vitro binding assays with immunopurified p68 confirmed these observations. Secondary-structure analysis of several mutant VAI RNAs suggests that the binding does not depend on the long duplex regions but requires all the elements of the functional domain. We propose that the functional domain and the p68-binding domain of the VAI RNA are identical. 
Insulin action and metabolism in patients with head and neck cancer. Cachexia is a phenomenon commonly observed in patients with cancer, but its etiology is poorly understood. Abnormalities of insulin action and metabolism that have been hypothesized to promote cancer cachexia were investigated in this study using a computerized euglycemic clamp and modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) in a group of malnourished patients with localized head and neck cancer, and in healthy, well-nourished, age- and, sex-matched controls. Glucose disposal rates, determined by the euglycemic clamp at three different rates of insulin infusion did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, mean plasma insulin concentrations at each level of insulin infused were significantly lower in the patients with cancer than in the control subjects resulting in unexpectedly higher calculated insulin metabolic clearance rate in the patients with cancer. Peripheral insulin sensitivity calculated from the slope of glucose disposal versus plasma insulin concentration did not differ between the two groups. Results from the FSIGT demonstrated no difference in insulin sensitivity or insulin-independent glucose disappearance between the two groups. However, whole body glucose appearance was significantly elevated in the patients with cancer. Thus, increased whole body glucose utilization in the absence of insulin resistance or increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal was observed. These data are consistent with the concept of a localized tumor acting as a glucose drain in which case increased glucose appearance and increased insulin clearance would defend against hypoglycemia. 
Focal myositis, a benign inflammatory pseudotumour: CT appearances. Focal myositis is a rare benign pseudotumour of skeletal muscle, of unknown cause. Clinically it presents as an enlarging mass within muscle, usually of an extremity, and is often mistaken for a soft tissue neoplasm. The diagnosis is made by biopsy which reveals characteristic histological changes of inflammation, focal degeneration and regeneration, and some evidence of denervation. The CT findings include irregularity and enlargement of the muscles involved, with diffuse, poorly defined fatty infiltration of the muscle planes, but no evidence of an associated mass. We present two cases of focal myositis of the calf, both of which mimicked a soft tissue neoplasm, and in which CT was helpful in determining the nature and extent of the abnormality, for needle biopsy, and follow-up. 
Role of radiation after operative palliation in cancer of the proximal bile ducts. Cancer of the proximal bile ducts continues to pose a formidable problem to even the most experienced biliary surgeon. From 1977 through 1985, 51 patients with histologically confirmed proximal bile duct cancers underwent surgical treatment. The lesion was confined to the hilar region in 30 patients; there was extensive hepatic infiltration or distant metastatic disease in 21 patients. One patient underwent resection. Biopsy only was performed in six patients. In the remaining 44 patients, transtumoral dilation and intubation were performed. These 44 patients were further analyzed with regard to how survival was affected by the presence of metastatic disease and by the adjunctive use of radiation therapy. Mean survival in those patients with metastatic disease (n = 16) was 6.1 months, and survival was not improved by the use of postoperative radiation. In the absence of metastatic or advanced local disease, however, the addition of external beam radiation did significantly extend the mean survival from 4.5 to 12.2 months and the median survival from 2.2 to 12.2 months. The operative mortality for the series was 14% and postoperative complications occurred in 18 patients. These findings suggest that the addition of external beam radiation improves survival in patients undergoing palliative treatment of hilar tumors. Further confirmation of the value of radiation awaits prospective investigation. 
Hemodynamic and electrophysiological actions of cocaine. Effects of sodium bicarbonate as an antidote in dogs. BACKGROUND. Cocaine abuse has been implicated as a cause of death due to sudden cardiac arrest. METHODS AND RESULTS. We examined the hemodynamic and electrophysiological effects of cocaine administered as a series of 5-mg/kg i.v. boluses coupled with a continuous infusion in anesthetized dogs. Sodium bicarbonate (50 meq i.v.) was administered as a potential antidote in 11 of 15 dogs, and intravenous 5% dextrose was given in the remaining four. In a dose-dependent fashion, cocaine significantly decreased blood pressure, coronary blood flow, and cardiac output; increased PR, QRS, QT, and QTc intervals and sinus cycle length; and increased ventricular effective refractory period and dispersion of ventricular refractoriness. No afterdepolarizations were noted in the monophasic action potential recording. Nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred spontaneously in two dogs, and sustained ventricular tachycardia could be induced by programmed stimulation at the end of the dosing protocol in five of 11 animals. Sodium bicarbonate promptly decreased cocaine-induced QRS prolongation to nearly that measured at baseline but had no effect on the other electrocardiographic or hemodynamic variables. In one dog, sodium bicarbonate administration was associated with reversion of ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that high-dose cocaine possesses negative inotropic and potent type I electrophysiological effects. Sodium bicarbonate selectively reversed cocaine-induced QRS prolongation and may be a useful treatment of ventricular arrhythmias associated with slowed ventricular conduction in the setting of cocaine overdose. 
Hospitalisation of prostatic cancer patients undergoing orchiectomy. We report our experience with 100 orchiectomies for advanced prostatic cancer in hospitalised patients. Approximately 60% of the patients required hospitalisation for additional treatment and investigation of complications due to their disease at the time of orchiectomy. In 51 cases the orchiectomy was combined with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP); 37 patients had pathological levels of serum creatinine and 17 had pathological dilatation of the upper urinary tract, 6 of whom required a nephrostomy catheter. Because of anaemia on admission, 21 patients received a peri-operative blood transfusion. Two patients had significant post-operative bleeding, 2 developed a wound infection and 1 had a deep thrombophlebitis. The patients' mean age was 76.4 years and the period of hospitalisation ranged from 3 to 150 days with peaks at 3 and 8 days. The most important reason for prolonged hospitalisation was social problems. It was concluded that many patients who were hospitalised as a direct consequence of their prostatic carcinoma would have been in hospital for a similar period regardless of the method of hormonal manipulation used. Because so many patients have other reasons for hospitalisation, or require additional surgical procedures such as TURP, the true average cost of orchiectomy for advanced prostatic cancer is difficult to determine. 
Low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) reduces restenosis after iliac angioplasty in the hypercholesterolemic rabbit. Smooth muscle cell proliferation is central to the process of restenosis. Attempts to inhibit the events leading to this proliferation have met with little success. In addition to its known antithrombotic effects, heparin also has inhibitory effects on smooth muscle cell proliferation. These effects appear to be unrelated to its anticoagulant properties and are retained in low molecular weight heparin derivatives. Although the use of heparin for as long as 18 to 24 h after coronary angioplasty in humans has not prevented restenosis, longer treatment periods have not been assessed. This study examines the effect of treatment with a low molecular weight heparin (enoxaparin) in a hypercholesterolemic rabbit iliac artery model. Control rabbits had a mean iliac artery diameter of 0.70 +/- 0.06 mm, which increased to 1.73 +/- 0.09 mm after balloon angioplasty. At follow-up angiography 4 weeks later, the mean vessel diameter was 0.56 +/- 0.12 mm. Animals treated with low dose enoxaparin (1 mg/kg per day) for 4 weeks and high dose enoxaparin (10 mg/kg per day) for either 2 or 4 weeks had similar mean luminal diameters before and immediately after angioplasty. At follow-up angiography, the mean luminal diameter was 0.82 +/- 0.17 mm for low dose enoxaparin, 1.04 +/- 0.20 mm for 2 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.03 versus control) and 1.19 +/- 0.09 mm for 4 week high dose enoxaparin (p = 0.001 versus control). When defined as loss of 50% of the initial gain achieved with angioplasty, restenosis was found in all control vessels. 
Intratumoral cytogenetic heterogeneity in a benign neoplasm. Cytogenetic findings are reported in a 64-year-old man who had a history of rapid growth of a mass in the left groin area. The histopathologic diagnosis of the tumor was consistent with that of a lipoma with atypia. Cytogenetic analysis was done on an incisional biopsy specimen. The initial biopsy specimen revealed, in addition to normal cells, three different clones: 46,XY,t(12;21)(q13;q21), 46,XY, t(2;12)(q11.2'1.2), t(19;20)(q13.1'3), and 47.XY,+ r. The subsequently excised specimen showed a normal male karyotype (46,XY) and a predominant clone with the karyotype, 47,XY,t(2;12)(q11.2'1.2),t(3;11)(p24'5), + r. One cell with 47,XY, + r was present. In addition, polyploid cells with large markers, rings, and a high frequency of telomeric associations were also observed. 
Short-bowel syndrome: a review of the role of nutrition support. Advances in long-term venous access devices and in parenteral nutrition solutions have made it possible for patients with severe short bowel syndrome to survive and to live in our society. The spectrum of this disease is such that some patients may be able to lessen their dependence or even become free from parenteral therapy. This review will discuss the role of nutrition support in the patient with short bowel syndrome. 
A prospective evaluation of arterial intimal injuries in an experimental model. The management of arterial intimal defects remains controversial because of uncertainty concerning their natural history. We developed an experimental canine model to prospectively evaluate posterior wall intimal flaps in the superficial femoral artery. Arterial intimal flaps were constructed in 20 anesthetized dogs (40 arteries) and evaluated by arteriography, and angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound. Postoperative patency rates at 1 (n = 20) and 3 weeks (n = 20) were compared with a control group of ten animals (n = 20, arteriotomy without intimal flap). Acute thromboses occurred in five experimental arteries with thromboses of eight additional experimental arteries at followup. Control patency was 100%, while experimental group patencies were 75% (p less than 0.05) at 1 week and 60% (p less than 0.009) at 3 weeks. All thrombosed arteries had intimal flaps with greater than 75% luminal stenosis. We conclude that intimal injuries cause arterial thromboses acutely and during subsequent followup. Intimal flaps with stenosis greater than 75% as determined arteriographically are at greatest risk for thrombosis. Angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound characterize arterial intimal defects and may delineate injuries requiring surgical or endovascular repair. 
Successful treatment of primary amebic meningoencephalitis. The fourth documented survivor of primary amebic meningoencephalitis, a young man with a history of waterskiing in a stagnant freshwater lake in northeastern Pennsylvania, is presented. Early consideration of this unusual diagnosis, based on historical factors (recent contact with warm fresh water), coupled with prompt aggressive therapy with high-dose amphotericin B is emphasized in achieving a successful outcome. 
Secretory IgA- and IgG-coated bacteria in chronically discharging ears. SIgA- and IgG-coated bacteria obtained from 17 discharging middle ears (14 patients, 9 male, 5 female, age range from 1 to 79 years) were evaluated using an immunofluorescence assay. Simultaneously, quantitative and qualitative bacteriological analyses of the middle ear effusions (MEEs) were performed. MEEs containing Staphylococcus aureus harboured bacteria which were intensely coated with both SIgA and IgG antibodies. In contrast, MEEs containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed minimal, if any, SIgA- and IgG-coated bacteria. Two young patients harboured bacteria (Haemophilus influenzae and S. aureus/Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively) which were heavily coated with IgG, but not with SIgA. Immunoglobulin-coating of bacteria involved in otitis media is of the utmost importance in eradication of the infection. 
A case of granulomatous hepatitis after intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin administration. A 61-year-old man received intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as treatment for superficial bladder carcinoma. High spiking relapsing fevers began 39 days after the initial treatment. A liver biopsy revealed noncaseating granuloma. Deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization of the bone marrow was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Pressure exerted to instill the BCG may have favored dissemination. 
Effects of pulsed Nd:YAG laser on the surface of rabbit retina. Six albino rabbits were subjected to pulsed Nd:YAG laser irradiation to the retinal surface to determine whether such treatment would lead to proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Choroidal, retinal, and preretinal hemorrhages, noted at the time of treatment, resolved after 7 to 10 days. Histological examination showed no signs of anterior segment damage or proliferative vitreoretinopathy. These preliminary findings suggest that more extensive experimentation is warranted to determine if pulsed Nd:YAG laser may in fact safely be used to separate vitreoretinal adhesions in the treatment of retinal detachment. 
Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa and ulcerative colitis. Vasculitis in many forms has been reported rarely in association with ulcerative colitis. We report the occurrence of necrotizing vasculitis in a 48-year-old man 19 years after the onset of ulcerative colitis and 5 years after total colectomy with rectal preservation. The disease was limited to small arteries of skin and muscle consistent with the syndrome of cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa that has been reported with regional enteritis but not previously with ulcerative colitis. 
Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis. Neurologic syndromes often complicate the management of infective endocarditis (IE). We retrospectively reviewed 166 episodes of native valve endocarditis to assess the occurrence and implications of nonfocal encephalopathy, meningitis, salient headache, back pain, and brain abscess. Neurologic complications occurred in 35% (58/166) of patients: 41% (54/133) of mitral or aortic valve IE and 12% (4/33) of tricuspid valve IE. Of 133 cases of mitral or aortic valve IE, encephalopathy occurred in 14%, meningitis in 5%, and salient headache in 3%. All neurologic complications occurred more often with Staphylococcus aureus infection (67%) than with viridans streptococci (22%), including encephalopathy (22% versus 7%), meningitis (17% versus 0%), stroke (39% versus 16%), and death (39% versus 9%). Encephalopathy was associated with virulent organisms, increased patient age, and uncontrolled infection. Clinical, radiologic, and neuropathologic data all suggest that infective microemboli are often etiologic in IE-related encephalopathy. There were no macroscopic brain abscesses clinically identified. Meningitis occurred only with virulent organisms. While many clinical aspects of IE have changed in recent years, the frequency and gravity of neurologic complications have not. 
p53 in chronic myelogenous leukemia in acute phase. All patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) undergo clinical transition from chronic to acute phase. This transition is often associated with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 in the form of the i(17q) aberration. Since the p53 gene is a suppressor gene and is located on 17p13, we examined the possibility that it is inactivated during progression of CML. Therefore, we studied the structure and expression of p53 in the leukemic cells of a large number of CML patients in acute phase. We found that although the gene is rarely rearranged, one p53 allele is completely deleted in patients with the i(17q) aberration as well as in some patients who do not show karyotypic changes. In all of these patients the remaining allele is inactivated through loss of expression, rearrangement, or point mutation. Detailed analysis of some patients who carry both p53 alleles indicated neither loss of expression nor structural alterations. It appears that p53 loss of function is associated with progression of around 25% of CML patients. 
Early postoperative sternal approximation after ITA harvesting: computed tomographic evaluation. Between November 1989 and February 1990, 66 randomized sternotomized patients underwent aortocoronary bypass and were subjected to a sternal scanner in the early postoperative period. Each examination included a manubrial and a sternal body print. At each level, we studied the occurrence of spacing or misalignment of the sternal layers. The 66 patients were subdivided into four groups according to the type of conduit harvested (single left internal thoracic artery or saphenous vein) and the type of material used for the sternal closure (steel wires or nylon yarns). In all cases, adequate early sternal approximation, which is represented by a good alignment as well as by an excellent contact of the sternal layers, was infrequently demonstrated. Moreover, the two abnormalities most often observed were manubrial spacing and sternal body misalignment. The sternal closure technique and internal thoracic artery harvesting had no significant effect on the sternal approximation. To minimize manubrial spacing and sternal body misalignment, we propose that the surgeon should apply three threads through the manubrium, withdraw the shoulder roll beforehand, elevate both of the patient's shoulders, and maintain the two xyphoid layers in the same plane and in fairly close contact during the tightening of the wires. 
Exophytic signet-ring cell carcinoma of the colorectum Previous studies have assessed colorectal signet-ring cell carcinomas of the linitis plastica variant but not of the exophytic subtype. We retrospectively reviewed 20 cases of colorectal signet-ring cell carcinoma of the exophytic subtype (greater than 50% signet-ring cells). The patients ranged in age from 14 to 79 years (mean, 51.8 years); 10 were male; 17 were white; and three were black. Ten tumors were colonic (eight, right sided; two, left sided) and 10 were rectal; seven were stage B and 12 were stage C. One patient presented with distant metastases. Eleven of 16 tumors assessed by flow cytometry were diploid. Parenchymal hepatic metastases developed in only two patients. The overall 5-year survival rate was 36%, and matched cases did not vary significantly in survival from typical nonmucinous adenocarcinomas. There was a trend toward poorer survival for patients with advanced-stage tumor. Survival was not affected by primary site, ploidy, presence of vascular/lymphatic invasion or residual adenoma, or percentage of extracellular mucin or signet-ring cells. Our cases were somewhat lower stage than literature cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the lintis plastica variant. 
Improvement of estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide cholestasis by intravenous administration of dimethylethanolamine in the rat. The intravenous administration of dimethylethanolamine in the rat promotes a selective enrichment of liver membranes with polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines. The effect of dimethylethanolamine pretreatment on cholestasis induced by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide, a potent cholestatic agent, was assessed in this study. Dimethylethanolamine, dissolved in sodium-taurocholate was infused intravenously (0.3 mg/kg/min) for 15 hr. One group of control rats (estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls) received the bile salt only. An estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide bolus was then injected intravenously (10.4 mg/kg) into dimethylethanolamine-pretreated and estradiol 17 beta-D-control rats, and its effect on bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was compared for 3 hr. The estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide inhibitory effect on bile flow and biliary lipid secretion was significantly antagonized by dimethylethanolamine pretreatment. The maximum inhibition of bile flow was found 30 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration, when it decreased from 3.5 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/100 gm (basal) to 0.9 +/- 0.3 microliters/min/100 gm in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls, whereas in dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats this decreased only from 3.2 +/- 0.4 (basal) to 2.3 +/- 0.4 microliters/min/100 gm. Bile flow and the biliary secretion of cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine and bile salts were significantly higher in the dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats than in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls (p less than 0.02) during the cholestatic phase. The inhibitory effect of estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide on bile flow was associated with a marked decrease of membrane fluidity (p less than 0.001) assessed by 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy and with a cholesterol enrichment of microsomes, sinusoidal and canalicular liver plasma membranes and inhibition of sinusoidal Na+,K(+)-ATPase activity (p less than 0.05). These membrane alterations persisted 180 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration despite complete normalization of bile flow. Dimethylethanolamine pretreatment significantly counteracted the reduction of membrane fluidity (p less than 0.001), the cholesterol enrichment and the inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase (p less than 0.05) promoted by estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration in all membrane subfractions 30 and 180 min after administration. In addition, dimethylethanolamine-pretreated rats had more polyunsaturated fatty acids in membrane phosphatidylcholine with respect to the control groups. Dilatation of canaliculi and loss of microvilli were evident in estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide controls 180 min after estradiol 17 beta-D-glucuronide administration.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Failure to awaken after general anaesthesia secondary to paradoxical venous embolus. A patient is presented who failed to regain consciousness after an apparently uneventful nine-hour revision of a total hip replacement. There were no clinically important haemodynamic changes during the operation, and oxygen saturation, capnography and acid base balance were normal throughout. Postop CT of the head showed a large left MCA infarct with midline shift. At autopsy, the patient was found to have a previously unsuspected patent foramen ovale, and a venous embolus in the left internal carotid artery, which probably had originated from the periprostatic venous plexus with a large infarct in the distribution of the left anterior and middle cerebral arteries. The authors conclude that massive paradoxical venous emboli can occur during surgery with minimal haemodynamic changes. 
Radiographically occult endobronchial obstruction in bronchogenic carcinoma. PURPOSE: While central endobronchial tumors may become radiographically detectable when they cause significant endobronchial obstruction, the incidence of radiographically undetectable obstruction is not known. This study prospectively examined the incidence of radiographically undetectable completely obstructing lesions encountered during routine diagnostic bronchoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients referred for bronchoscopy at the San Diego Veterans Administration Medical Center because of suspected bronchogenic carcinoma formed the population base. Chest radiographs were interpreted routinely 24 hours prior to bronchoscopy. Patients found to have complete endobronchial obstruction during bronchoscopy were included in the analysis. RESULTS: Eighty-one completely obstructing lesions were found in 77 patients. No radiographic signs of obstruction were found in 36 (44%) completely obstructing endobronchial lesions. There was no difference in the rate of radiographically occult tumors based on cell type. Obstruction of segmental bronchi was more likely to be undetectable than obstruction of more proximal airways. Chest radiographs were normal in 13 (16%). All 13 had risk factors for and symptoms suggestive of bronchogenic carcinoma. CONCLUSION: Complete endobronchial obstruction due to bronchogenic carcinoma can occur frequently in patients at risk for lung cancer. The significant incidence of radiographically undetectable complete obstruction has implications for the diagnosis, staging, and assessment of treatment of lung cancer. 
Curative potential of primary whole-abdomen irradiation in ovarian carcinoma. Ovarian carcinoma remains a leading cause of cancer mortality in American women. The identification of active chemotherapy drugs and regimens has resulted in much less frequent use of radiation therapy at a time when technical and conceptual advances have been made. Unfortunately, the shift from radiotherapy to chemotherapy has not produced a discernible improvement in patient survival. Retrospective and prospective data suggest that whole-abdomen irradiation offers curative potential in patients with nonbulky residual disease after surgical cytoreduction. Its use should therefore be reconsidered as a primary adjuvant therapy in properly selected patients. 
Differences in release of tumor necrosis factor from THP-1 cells stimulated by filtrates of antibiotic-killed Escherichia coli. Bacterial products, such as endotoxin, activate mononuclear cells to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and other monokines capable of producing host cell injury. THP-1 cell TNF release in response to bacterial products generated during antibiotic killing of Escherichia coli (ATCC 12014) was evaluated. THP-1 is a mature monocytic leukemia cell line that produces TNF in a dose-dependent fashion in response to purified endotoxin. E. coli were incubated in the presence of amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, aztreonam, or imipenem at concentrations that killed greater than 99.9% of the organisms. Aliquots of these antibiotic-bacterial cultures were added to THP-1 cells, and TNF concentrations were determined by specific immunoassay. Amikacin and imipenem produced rapid bacterial killing and were associated with low TNF levels. Ceftazidime, aztreonam, and cefotaxime killed E. coli at a slower rate and were associated with significant increases in mononuclear cell TNF responses. Ciprofloxacin produced intermediate TNF levels. Differences exist among bactericidal antibodies in their ability to generate products capable of stimulating mononuclear cell TNF release. 
Cyclic AMP mediates the direct antiproliferative action of mismatched double-stranded RNA. Previous experiments have demonstrated that double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) can exert an antiproliferative effect on human tumor cells, independent of interferon (IFN) induction. However, the mechanism by which dsRNAs inhibit tumor growth has not been elucidated. As a first step in determining the molecular events responsible for growth arrest, we have explored the role of signal transduction through the cAMP system in the antiproliferative effect of the mismatched dsRNA, r(I)n.r(C12,U)n (Ampligen). These studies utilized the human glioma cell line A1235, which does not produce detectable levels of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma in response to mismatched dsRNA treatment. Treatment of A1235 cells with mismatched dsRNA in combination with either 1-(5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H-7), which inhibits cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C, or N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide (HA1004), which preferentially inhibits the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, yielded an antagonism of the mismatched dsRNA-induced antiproliferative effect. Measurement of adenylate cyclase activation showed a dose-dependent increase in activity at antiproliferative mismatched dsRNA concentrations, but not at lower, nonantiproliferative doses. This increase in activity was rapid, seen as early as 30 sec after initiation of treatment, and it was sustained at peak levels for 1-2 hr. Analysis of the intracellular cAMP concentration gave similar kinetics of induction. Exposure of cells to the stable cAMP analogue dibutyryl cAMP yielded dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine also inhibited proliferation. In contrast, neither H-7 nor HA1004 had an effect on growth inhibition induced by human natural IFN-alpha treatment. In addition, antiproliferative doses of IFN-alpha did not increase cAMP concentrations. These results indicate that the cAMP system is utilized by mismatched dsRNA as an early signal transduction mechanism for growth control. Furthermore, the antiproliferative effects induced by mismatched dsRNA and IFN can occur by different mechanisms of action. 
Parental origin of the extra chromosome in trisomy 18. The parental origin of the supernumerary chromosome 18 was investigated by RFLP analysis in 23 individuals with Edwards syndrome. All families were studied with the DNA probe pERT-25, which recognizes a locus of highly polymorphic tandemly repeated DNA sequences on chromosome 18. The extra chromosome was found to be of maternal origin in 19 patients (95%), of paternal origin in one patient (5%), and indeterminate in three patients. In one of the three indeterminate cases, a mosaic, an apparent recombination event had taken place within the pERT-25 locus. The overall high degree of informativeness of pERT-25 illustrates the power of a chromosome-specific variable-number tandem repeat probe (VNTR) in parental origin studies of aneuploidy. 
Metabolic disturbance as a cause of recurrent hematuria in children. Metabolic disturbance as a cause of recurrent hematuria in children. To evaluate metabolic disturbance as a cause of hematuria, 250 children, aged eight months to fourteen years, with recurrent hematuria were studied. In the present series, metabolic disturbance was mainly due to idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH), the most common etiology of hematuria without proteinuria in childhood. Sixty-seven (27%) of the children had IH, ten children (4%) had hyperuricosuria, and 27 (11%) had nephrolithiasis. To better characterize the IH into renal (RH) or absorptive hypercalciuria (AH) subtypes, 45 of the 67 children (ranging age from six to twelve years) were further submitted to an oral calcium load test. Eighteen patients (40%) had AH, 7 (15.5%) RH and 20 (44.4%) could not be classified as having AH or RH [indeterminant (ID) idiopathic hypercalciuria group]. Intravenous pyelography or ultrasound were normal in all children. The oral calcium load test may be useful in characterizing the subtype of IH in some children; however, a great number of the IH children were characterized as indeterminant. Also hyperuricosuria, recently described as another metabolic disturbance associated with hematuria, may be an important cause of recurrent hematuria in children. 
The nature of the naming deficit in Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. A comparison of naming performance, on the Boston Naming Test, of 52 patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT), 16 patients with Huntington's disease (HD) and 52 normal control subjects was performed using a comprehensive classification of error types. Spontaneous and cued naming scores were significantly impaired both in the DAT and HD groups, but performance in the DAT patients was significantly worse than that of the HD patients. Normal controls made predominantly semantic-category and circumlocutory errors. The HD group differed from normal only in the proportion of visually based errors, which was greater in the patient group. By contrast, the DAT patients made a significantly greater proportion of semantic-superordinate and semantic-associative errors. The same pattern of naming errors was found when a group of DAT and HD patients matched for overall naming ability was compared. A subgroup of 22 DAT patients was followed longitudinally over 3 y. Their deterioration in overall naming performance was accompanied by a consistent change in the profile of naming errors: the proportion of semantic-associative errors increased significantly as did the proportion of visual errors. These results are considered in the light of current cognitive models of naming. They suggest that in HD, naming deficits initially involve disruption of perceptual analysis, whereas in DAT such impairments in the early stages reflect a breakdown in semantic processes. However, as DAT progresses, perceptual problems also begin to contribute to the patients' naming difficulties. Postlexical (phonemic) processes remain relatively intact throughout in both diseases. 
Prostate specific antigen values after radical retropubic prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate: impact of adjuvant treatment (hormonal and radiation). Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were obtained before and after radical retropubic prostatectomy in 192 patients: 78 (41%) had pathological stage B2 cancer or less, 83 (43%) had stage C or C+ and 31 (16%) had stage D1 disease. Of those with stages B2 or less, C, C+ and D1 disease 82, 86, 65 and 90%, respectively, had postoperative PSA values of 0.2 ng./ml. or less (when first evaluated 30 or more days postoperatively). At 1 year postoperatively 94% of the stages C and C+ cancer patients treated with adjuvant radiation had PSA levels of 0.2 ng./ml. or less, which was significantly different from those not treated adjuvantly (p = 0.02). This effect of adjuvant radiation on PSA was temporary in the small number of patients with longer followup. Adjuvant orchiectomy for stage D1 lesions resulted in female PSA levels in virtually all cases. This decrease may be misleading and may reflect a direct hormonal effect rather than a decrease in tumor volume. Positive surgical margins did not significantly affect postoperative PSA levels, possibly because of the frequent use of adjuvant treatment. 
Plasma prostanoids in neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Influence of meconium aspiration. Thromboxane B2 may be a mediator of neonatal persistent pulmonary hypertension. Elevated levels of plasma thromboxane and prostacyclin have been described previously in hypoxic newborn infants with neonatal pulmonary hypertension. We measured serial plasma levels of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (stable metabolite of prostacyclin) in 21 newborn infants with severe respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. We sought to study (1) the evolution of plasma prostanoids in pulmonary hypertensive infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and (2) whether different pulmonary hypertensive diagnostic subgroups have distinctive prostanoid profiles. Our data indicated that infants with meconium aspiration had significantly lower levels of plasma thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha while receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than did infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension but no meconium aspiration. Levels of all infants decreased progressively as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support continued. 
Left ventricular diastolic filling abnormalities identified by Doppler echocardiography in asymptomatic patients with sickle cell anemia. To determine whether left ventricular diastolic abnormalities are an early feature of sickle cell anemia, indexes of diastolic filling were obtained with pulsed Doppler echocardiography in 30 consecutive patients with this disease (mean age 29 years; range 19 to 39) who had not experienced symptoms of heart failure and had normal left ventricular systolic function. Data were compared with those in 30 normal control subjects of similar ages. Seventeen (57%) of the 30 patients with sickle cell anemia had evidence of abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling. Six of these 17 patients had a Doppler pattern consistent with "restrictive" filling, characterized by reduced early diastolic deceleration time (less than 110 ms) or an increased rate of decline of early flow velocity (EF slope greater than 7.4 m/s2), or both, as well as decreased late diastolic velocity-time integral (2.6 +/- 0.7 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.8 cm in normal subjects; p less than 0.05). Another 11 patients showed a Doppler waveform consistent with impaired relaxation, characterized by prolonged deceleration time (greater than 166 ms) or reduced EF slope (less than 3.8 m/s2), as well as increased late diastolic velocity-time integral (4.0 +/- 0.5 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.8 cm in normal subjects; p = 0.03). This Doppler echocardiographic analysis demonstrates that left ventricular diastolic filling patterns are altered in patients with sickle cell anemia and that these diastolic abnormalities may be present in the absence of symptoms of heart failure. These abnormal patterns suggest an intrinsic myocardial abnormality in patients with sickle anemia and may prove to be early markers of cardiac disease. 
Serum cholesterol and mortality among Japanese-American men. The Honolulu (Hawaii) Heart Program. Hawaiian men of Japanese ancestry followed up for 18 or more years after a baseline examination showed a quadratic distribution of death rates at different levels of serum cholesterol. Mortality from cancer progressively decreased and mortality from coronary heart disease progressively increased with rising levels of serum cholesterol. There was a positive association between baseline serum cholesterol levels and deaths from coronary heart disease at 0 to 6 years, 7 to 12 years, and 13 years and longer after examination. The inverse relationship between cancer and serum cholesterol levels was stronger in the first 6 years than in the next 6 years and, although still inverse, lost statistical significance after 13 years. Cancers of the colon and lung showed the strongest association with low baseline serum cholesterol levels, while gastric or rectal cancer failed to show this association. Organ specificity and persistence of the inverse association beyond 6 years suggest that the nutritional demands of cancers may not entirely explain the inverse association with some cancers. The quadratic distribution of deaths in this cohort remained after coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer were removed from the analysis. For the entire period of observation, the lowest mortalities were found in men with serum cholesterol levels between 4.65 and 6.18 mmol/L (between 180 and 239 mg/dL). Manipulation of serum cholesterol levels below this level would not be desirable if this were to result in increased risk of death from cancer or other disease. This study does not rule out this possibility. 
The effect of elemental diet on intestinal permeability and inflammation in Crohn's disease. This study examines whether treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet improves intestinal integrity and inflammation as assessed by a 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetatic acid (EDTA) permeability test and the fecal excretion of 111In-labeled autologous leukocytes, respectively. Thirty-four patients with active Crohn's disease completed a 4-week treatment course with an elemental diet. Active disease was characterized by increased intestinal permeability [24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA, 6.4% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- SE); normal, less than 3.0%] and by high fecal excretion of 111In-labeled leukocytes (14.2% +/- 1.1%; normal, less than 1.0%). Twenty-seven (80%) went into clinical remission, usually within a week of starting treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in both the urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA (to 3.4% +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.01) and the fecal excretion of 111In (to 5.7% +/- 1.0%; P less than 0.001), indicating that such treatment is not just symptomatic. A framework for the mechanism by which elemental diet works, centering around the importance of the integrity of the intestinal barrier function, is proposed, and also appears to provide a logical explanation for some relapses of the disease. 
The acetylcholine-induced flare response in evaluation of small fiber dysfunction. We iontophoresed acetylcholine on the dorsum of the foot and simultaneously measured flare and sweat responses using laser Doppler and sudorometric techniques, respectively. We compared these responses with those induced by histamine. Both acetylcholine and histamine produced dose-dependent flare, but only acetylcholine produced sweat responses. Responses to acetylcholine and histamine were blocked by hexamethonium chloride and pyrilamine maleate, respectively (p less than 0.01). We compared flare and sweat responses in 26 control subjects, 21 asymptomatic diabetic patients and 41 patients (17 diabetic, 24 nondiabetic) with pain symptoms suggestive of small fiber neuropathy and normal sensation (n = 15) or mild to moderate (n = 19) or severe (n = 7) sensory loss. No patient had trophic foot lesions. Basal skin blood flow and maximal flare responses were not significantly different among the various subgroups (Control subjects, 49 +/- 7.4; asymptomatic diabetic patients, 29 +/- 4; patients with small fiber neuropathy and normal sensation, 34 +/- 6; with neuropathy and mild to moderate sensory loss, 29 +/- 4.8; and with neuropathy and severe sensory loss, 35 +/- 5 ml/100 gm, for flare response, respectively). Flare responses lower than the lowest found in control subjects occurred in 5 of 21 asymptomatic diabetic patients, 4 of 15 patients with small fiber neuropathy and normal sensation, 5 of 19 with neuropathy and mild to moderate sensory loss, and 1 of 7 with neuropathy and severe sensory loss. 
The sleep apnoea syndrome in obesity: risk of sudden death. A total of 34 severely obese men with a history of heavy snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness indicative of obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome (OSAS) were studied prospectively. Their mean age was 46 years, and mean body mass index was 41.6 kg m-2. During a 4-year follow-up, 15% (5/34) of these subjects died (three cases of acute myocardial infarction and two cases of pulmonary oedema), all of them suddenly and unexpectedly, outside hospital. On autopsy the degree of atherosclerosis was found to be moderate in all cases. In 68% (15/22) of the men a pathological apnoea index (mean value 46 +/- 20) confirmed the OSAS diagnosis. Exercise tests and neurological examinations did not reveal any other causes of daytime sleepiness. Mean blood pressure at rest and during exercise was normal, and mean serum lipid and blood glucose levels were normal. Spirometry revealed intrapulmonary restrictive changes that could not be attributed to the heavy thoracic wall. Compliance was reduced to about 50% of reference values, and the mean pCO2 level (5.8 kPa) was close to the upper reference limit. Blood tests suggested that high alcohol consumption may be an important factor contributing to OSAS. These results demonstrate that morbidly obese men with a history of OSAS have a high risk of sudden cardiovascular death, despite the absence of other conventional risk factors. 
Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis: an immunohistochemical study. Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is a rare inflammatory disorder of the anterior pituitary gland. In some cases, there is evidence of concurrent autoimmune disease. We present the case of a 39-year-old woman who developed visual disturbance during the early postpartum period. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intrasellar mass with suprasellar extension. Study of the tumor tissue showed diffuse infiltration of the entire pituitary gland by lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes were T cells that might have modulated the immunoreaction to the anterior pituitary gland. We suggest that the disorder is related to cell-mediated immunity as well as humoral immunity. 
Alcoholic cirrhosis and osteoporosis in men: a light and scanning electron microscopy study. Subjects with chronic alcoholism are associated with a higher prevalence of bone fractures, compared with age-matched controls. However, the pathogenesis of alcoholic osteopathy remains poorly understood. In this study, the bone cells activities and the bone matrix were studied using different techniques such as bone morphometry, scanning electron microscopy and computer reconstruction. Male patients (N = 20), aged 59.1 +/- 10.1 years, presenting a chronic decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, were admitted into this study. A histomorphometric analysis of a transiliac bone biopsy was done after a double tetracycline labeling of the bone. A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study was performed on eight out of the 20 patients on an additional biopsy. The bone mass was significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients. A marked defect in the osteoblastic function was observed with reduced osteoid parameters, lower mean wall thickness, and slower bone formation rate leading to a thinning of bone trabeculae. Conversely, trabecular resorption surfaces were markedly increased. SEM examination of bone biopsies was also consistent with delayed and impaired osteoblastic activity leading to extended and scalloped resorption surfaces covered by unusually thin layers of calcified collagen fibers. The reduced osteoblastic activity associated with normal osteoclastic function appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic osteoporosis leading to decreased bone mass with thinner trabeculae. 
Quantification of ST-segment changes during coronary angioplasty in patients with left bundle branch block. Electrocardiographic manifestations of ischemia are difficult to interpret in the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Recently developed techniques allow continuous computerized digital analysis of ST segments that can be zeroed to the patient's own baseline electrocardiogram even if that baseline is abnormal conduction. With use of this technology, ST-segment changes during balloon coronary occlusion were compared in 10 patients with LBBB versus an age-, sex-, and coronary anatomy-matched population of 20 control subjects with normal baseline conduction. ST-segment deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm from baseline was present in 80% of patients with LBBB and in 75% of control patients (difference not significant). There was no significant difference between patients with LBBB versus control patients in maximal ST-segment deviation (2.6 +/- 1.7 vs 2.0 +/- 1.0 mm) or in ST-segment deviation measured after 60 seconds of occlusion (2.4 +/- 1.3 vs 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm). ST-segment deviation reached 1 mm more quickly in patients with LBBB (33 +/- 11 seconds) than in control subjects (60 +/- 36 seconds) (p = 0.003). It is concluded that ST-segment analysis is feasible in patients with LBBB using digital self-referenced ST analysis and may provide important clinical information regarding the presence of myocardial ischemia. 
The role of echocardiography in the evaluation of mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. With the introduction of the coronary care unit and more effective therapy for primary life-threatening arrhythmias, cardiogenic shock and the mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction are now responsible for the majority of in-hospital deaths. These mechanical complications, which include myocardial rupture of the left ventricular free wall, rupture of the ventricular septum, and rupture of the papillary muscle, are estimated to account for 25,000 fatalities yearly in the United States. Although the mechanism of myocardial rupture has not been clearly defined, there is increasing evidence that infarct expansion, which can be readily detected by two-dimensional echocardiography, may be an important pathophysiologic factor. The ready availability of echocardiography in the coronary care unit has made a major impact on the immediate diagnosis of mechanical complications in the hemodynamically compromised patient with acute myocardial infarction. In particular, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic techniques have been extremely useful in the identification and localization of ventricular septal rupture. In addition, papillary muscle rupture can be readily diagnosed by Doppler approaches and is easily distinguished from ventricular septal rupture. In view of increasing evidence that early surgical intervention is indicated in these patients, these echocardiographic approaches offer the surgeon prompt diagnostic and anatomic information. Unfortunately, rupture of the free wall of the left ventricle often results in sudden death within minutes before echocardiographic evaluation can be attempted. Nevertheless, rapid echocardiographic diagnosis provides the patient with the possibility of potential life-saving resuscitative interventions before immediate surgery. Thus, over the past decade, echocardiography has become a vital tool in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction. The development of Doppler techniques, color flow Doppler, and esophageal approaches should further enhance our diagnostic abilities and allow careful monitoring of patients before, during, and after surgical repair. It is hoped that with the improvements in echocardiographic evaluation of mechanical rupture and more rapid surgical intervention, future studies will demonstrate better surgical results with good long-term survival in patients with myocardial rupture. 
Treatment of Parkinson's disease with proglumide, a CCK antagonist. Proglumide, a cholecystokinin antagonist, did not improve Parkinson's disease in a preliminary drug treatment trial. 
Leukoaraiosis correlates with cerebral hypoperfusion in vascular dementia. Leukoaraiosis quantified by computerized densitometric measurements of reduced Hounsfield numbers was correlated with local cerebral blood flow on the same computed tomographic images of 35 patients with multi-infarct dementia and 16 age-matched elderly normal volunteers. The ratio for area of frontal leukoaraiosis to total area of parenchyma among the patients was significantly greater than that among the normal volunteers (5.8 +/- 2.3% compared with 3.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.001). Severity of leukoaraiosis around the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles correlated significantly with severity of leukoaraiosis of the centrum semiovale adjacent to the bodies of the lateral ventricles. Cerebral blood flow values for all representative cerebral regions except the parietal white matter were reduced among the patients compared with the normal volunteers. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that reduced cerebral perfusion in the putamen and thalamus correlated significantly with the severity of leukoaraiosis. Cerebral hypoperfusion in territories supplied by deep penetrating arteries may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukoaraiosis. 
Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and cutaneous vasculitis. Report of a case with exacerbation of a cutaneous neoplasm during immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a patient with both Muir-Torre syndrome and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. A keratoacanthoma developed after immunosuppressive therapy for necrotizing vasculitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. 
Perioperative morbidity and mortality of gynecologic brachytherapy. The incidence and nature of perioperative complications associated with gynecologic brachytherapy applications were determined in 462 implants performed on 327 patients with cervical, endometrial, or vaginal cancer from 1986 to 1988. Twenty-one patients (6.4%) had life-threatening complications, including cardiac (16 patients), thromboembolic (4 patients), and pulmonary (1 patient) events. Three complications (0.9%) were fatal within the first 30 days, and two patients died of delayed sequelae of perioperative complications; thus, there was an overall 1.5% mortality rate. Patients experiencing life-threatening complications tended to be older (P = 0.0002), and to have a history of cardiac disease (P = 0.0002) and an increased American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) score (P = 0.003). Logistic analysis demonstrated that a history of cardiac disease and increased age were independent predictors of life-threatening complications (P = 0.01). Careful patient selection and intensive perioperative care of the high-risk patient may prove to substantially diminish these complications. 
Demonstration of viraemia patterns in haemophiliacs treated with hepatitis-C-virus-contaminated factor VIII concentrates. Sequential serum samples from previously untreated haemophiliacs in whom non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) developed after they received factor VIII concentrate contaminated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) were tested by a commercial assay for the presence of antibodies to the C100 protein of HCV (anti-C100) and by "nested" PCR for the presence of HCV RNA sequences. Three temporal patterns of viraemia were observed: transient viraemia in acute resolving NANBH; viraemia lasting for several years in chronic NANBH; and intermittent viraemia in chronic NANBH, with an initial transient phase followed by recurrence after many months. In three of five cases the initial detection of serum HCV RNA was made before the onset of liver function test abnormality, many weeks or months before anti-C100 seroconversion. Diagnosis of acute HCV infection may therefore be possible much earlier by PCR than by existing serological techniques, but the timing of samples may be critical. 
Twenty-four-hour activity of felodipine extended release in chronic stable angina pectoris. To investigate the antiischemic efficacy and duration of action of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine, 15 patients with stable exertional angina were enrolled in a double-blind, crossover study comparing 2 doses (5 and 10 mg) of felodipine extended release (ER) and placebo given once daily for 1 week. Bicycle exercise tests were repeated at the end of each treatment period 4 and 24 hours after dosing. Four hours after dosing with both felodipine doses, only 5 patients discontinued the exercise test because of greater than 2 mm of ST-segment depression, whereas 10 continued until exhaustion (p less than 0.01 vs placebo). Compared with placebo, total exercise time was increased by 19% (p less than 0.001), with no difference between doses. After 24 hours, exercise duration was prolonged up to physical exhaustion in 6 patients taking felodipine 10 mg (p less than 0.05 vs both placebo and felodipine 5 mg); moreover, 11 patients taking 10 mg and 5 taking 5 mg increased time to 1 mm of ST depression greater than or equal to 15% compared with exercise time during the placebo test. Mean time to 1 mm of ST depression at 24 hours was increased by 8% with 5 mg and by 18% with 10 mg (p less than 0.001 vs placebo; p less than 0.01 between doses). Total exercise time at 24 hours was increased with both doses (p less than 0.001), with greater efficacy with the 10-mg dose (p less than 0.05 vs 5 mg). 
Administration of thyroxine in treated Graves' disease. Effects on the level of antibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone receptors and on the risk of recurrence of hyperthyroidism BACKGROUND. Antibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptors that stimulate the thyroid gland cause hyperthyroidism in patients with Graves' disease, and their production during antithyroid drug treatment is an important determinant of the course of the disease. One factor that might contribute to the persistent production of antibodies to TSH receptors is stimulation of the release of thyroid antigens by TSH during antithyroid drug therapy. We therefore studied the effect of the suppression of TSH secretion by thyroxine on the levels of antibodies to TSH receptors after thyroid hormone secretion had been normalized by methimazole. METHODS AND RESULTS. The levels of antibodies to TSH receptors were measured during treatment with methimazole, either alone or in combination with thyroxine, in 109 patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease. The patients first received 30 mg of methimazole daily for six months. All were euthyroid after six months, and their mean (+/- SD) level of antibodies to TSH receptors decreased from 64 +/- 9 percent to 25 +/- 15 percent (P less than 0.01; normal, 2.9 +/- 1.4 percent). Sixty patients then received 100 micrograms of thyroxine and 10 mg of methimazole and 49 received placebo and 10 mg of methimazole daily for one year. In the thyroxine-treated group, the mean serum thyroxine concentration increased from 108 +/- 16 nmol per liter to 145 +/- 11 nmol per liter (P less than 0.01), and the level of antibodies to TSH receptors decreased from 28 +/- 10 percent to 10 +/- 3 percent after one month of combination therapy. In the patients who received placebo and methimazole, the mean serum thyroxine concentration decreased and the level of antibodies to TSH receptors did not change. Methimazole, but not thyroxine or placebo, was discontinued in each group 1 1/2 years after the beginning of treatment. The level of antibodies to TSH receptors further decreased (from 6.6 +/- 3.2 percent at the time methimazole was discontinued to 2.1 +/- 1.2 percent one year later) in the patients who continued to receive thyroxine, but it increased (from 9.1 +/- 4.8 percent to 17.3 +/- 5.8 percent during the same period) in the patients who received placebo. One patient in the thyroxine-treated group (1.7 percent) and 17 patients in the placebo group (34.7 percent) had recurrences of hyperthyroidism within three years after the discontinuation of methimazole. CONCLUSIONS. The administration of thyroxine during antithyroid drug treatment decreases both the production of antibodies to TSH receptors and the frequency of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. 
Vessel associated adhesion molecules in normal skin and acute graft-versus-host disease. Immunohistological staining of skin from normal donors and bone marrow transplant recipients was undertaken using antibodies to two vessel associated adhesion molecules, endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1). In normal skin ELAM-1 staining was restricted to a variable but generally small number of endothelial cells which were significantly increased in graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), but only when the fully developed histological picture of epidermal basal damage and leucocytic infiltration was present. All other biopsy specimens from marrow recipients taken before or after transplantation were similar to those of normal controls even in the presence of a clinical rash consistent with early GvHD. Although VCAM-1 positivity was seen on a few endothelial cells in normal skin, staining was mainly observed on dermal dendritic cells surrounding blood vessels and adnexal structures. In specimens with histological evidence of GvHD, positive perivascular dendritic cells were increased and were accompanied by the appearance of large numbers of similar cells dispersed throughout the upper dermis. Biopsy specimens from marrow recipients before and after transplantation resembled those from normal donors except for the presence of a rash after transplantation when some specimens, which lacked the leucocytic infiltrate diagnostic of GvHD, showed an increase in VCAM-1 positive cells, particularly in the upper dermis. The identification of these cells may therefore be useful in diagnosing early GvHD. 
Intensive chemotherapy induction followed by interferon-alpha maintenance in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia. In a pilot study, 32 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia were treated with intensive chemotherapy induction followed by interferon-alpha (IFN-A) maintenance. Intensive chemotherapy consisted of three cycles of daunorubicin 120 mg/m2 on day 1, cytarabine 80 mg/m2 daily for 10 days, vincristine 2 mg on day 1, and prednisone 100 mg daily for 5 days (DOAP). Maintenance therapy with IFN-A at a doses of 3 x 10(6) to 5 x 10(6) units/m2 daily was adjusted according to counts and toxicity. The outcome of patients was compared with a matched historic population of 64 patients treated with IFN-A alone. Overall, 60% of patients had a cytogenetic response (partial or complete) with induction chemotherapy, but only eight (25%) had a sustained cytogenetic response with IFN-A maintenance. After a median follow-up of 67 months, the 6-year survival rate of the 32 patients was 58%, compared with 36% for the matched historic group (P = 0.084). The incidence of lymphoid blastic transformation in the two groups was 25% and 48%, respectively (P = 0.10) and durable cytogenetic responses, 25% and 19%, respectively (P = 0.48). In summary, the addition of intensive chemotherapy induction to IFN-A maintenance does not improve the survival rate, incidence of lymphoid blastic transformation, or incidence of durable cytogenetic response compared with the results achieved with IFN-A therapy alone. 
Determinants of perinatal outcome in pregnancy-induced hypertension with absence of umbilical artery end-diastolic frequencies. Forty-three pregnancies that were complicated by pregnancy-induced hypertension and either absence of umbilical artery end-diastolic frequencies (n = 32) or reversal of umbilical artery end-diastolic frequencies (n = 11) were reviewed. The incidence of perinatal mortality and morbidity was similar for the two Doppler patterns. Perinatal survival was highly dependent on the gestational age when hypertension first appeared. Presentation at greater than or equal to 30 weeks' gestation was associated with a perinatal survival rate of 86%. Presentation at less than 30 weeks' gestation was associated with a perinatal survival rate of 38% (p less than 0.005). Pregnancy-induced hypertension that presented before 30 weeks was more often associated with a 5-minute Apgar score less than 7 (p less than 0.005) and a nonreactive nonstress test (p less than 0.05) compared with pregnancy-induced hypertension that presented at or beyond 30 weeks. For pregnancies that presented before 30 weeks, the only difference between perinatal survivors (n = 11) and perinatal deaths (n = 18) was a higher incidence of birth weight at or below the 10th percentile among deaths (p = 0.02). 
Sudden death and paroxysmal autonomic dysfunction in stiff-man syndrome. Two women with typical stiff-man syndrome (SMS) developed increasingly frequent attacks of muscle spasms with severe paroxysmal autonomic dysfunctions such as transient hyperpyrexia, diaphoresis, tachypnea, tachycardia, pupillary dilation, and arterial hypertension. Autoantibodies to GABA-ergic neurons were identified in the serum of both patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of one. Both died suddenly and unexpectedly. General autopsy did not reveal the cause of death. Neuropathological studies revealed perivascular gliosis in the spinal cord and brain stem of one patient and lymphocytic perivascular infiltration in the spinal cord, brain stem, and basal ganglia of the other. The occurrence of a chronic inflammatory reaction in one of the two patients supports the idea that an autoimmune disease against GABA-ergic neurons may be involved in SMS. A review of the literature indicates that functional impairment in SMS is severe and prognosis is unpredictable because of the potential for sudden and unexpected death. Both muscular abnormalities and autonomic dysfunctions may result from autoimmunity directed against GABA-ergic neurons. 
A new point mutation in the 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine-binding domain of the c-erbA beta thyroid hormone receptor is tightly linked to generalized thyroid hormone resistance. Two different mutations in the c-erbA beta thyroid hormone receptor have recently been reported as genetic abnormalities responsible for the syndrome of generalized thyroid hormone resistance (GTHR). We have now found in a third kindred, D, in which GTHR is inherited as a dominant disease, a new point mutation in the T3-binding domain of c-erbA beta. A guanine to cytosine base substitution at nucleotide position 1305, which altered codon-335 from glutamine (CAG) to histidine (CAC), was found in one allele of 10 affected members and was not found in 6 unaffected members. This C-1305 sequence was not present in 106 random alleles, indicating that it was a mutation in c-erbA beta, and it was tightly linked to GTHR in kindred D, with a maximum logarithm of the odds score of 4.19 at a recombination fraction of 0. The tight linkage result confirms that GTHR maps to the c-erbA beta locus in multiple kindreds. In view of the tight linkage between the C-1305 mutation and GTHR, and that this mutation is a nonconservative alteration in a crucial region of the T3-binding domain, it is probably the genetic defect in kindred D responsible for GTHR. The kindred D receptor appears to result in a different phenotype of tissue resistance compared to the previously reported kindred. A receptor with a mutation in the carboxy-terminus of c-erbA beta. 
Relationship between the timing of aneurysm surgery and the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. A consecutive series of 145 patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were operated on within 7 days of SAH and were prospectively evaluated over a 4-year period to determine if the timing of aneurysm surgery influenced the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. All patients were managed with a standardized policy of urgent surgical clipping and treatment with aggressive prophylactic postoperative volume expansion. Patients with delayed ischemic symptoms were additionally treated with induced hypertension. Forty-nine patients underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 (Group 1) post-SAH, 60 patients on Day 2 or 3 (Group 2), and 36 patients on Days 4 through 7 (Group 3). Postoperative delayed cerebral ischemia developed in 16% of (Group 1) patients, in 22% of Group 2 patients, and in 28% of Group 3 patients. Cerebral infarction resulting from delayed cerebral ischemia developed in only 4% of Group 1 patients, 10% of Group 2 patients, and 11% of Group 3 patients. A bad clinical outcome as a result of delayed cerebral ischemia occurred in one Group 1 patient (2%), two Group 2 patients (3%), and one Group 3 patient (3%). Preoperative grade was not significantly correlated with the incidence or severity of delayed cerebral ischemia at any time interval except that patients in modified Hunt and Hess Grade I or II who underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 after SAH had no strokes or bad outcomes from delayed cerebral ischemia. This study demonstrates that there is no rationale for delaying aneurysm surgery based on the time interval between SAH and patient evaluation. 
Special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in elderly patients with upper gastrointestinal disease. Special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations apply to older patients with upper gastrointestinal disease. Age-related anatomical and physiologic changes occur in the major organ systems, affecting functions as diverse as swallowing and hepatic and renal clearance of therapeutic drugs. Because of these factors, and because older patients are more likely to be receiving multiple drugs for concomitant illness, they are more prone to drug-drug interactions and to medication-induced injury of the esophagus and stomach. In addition, several gastrointestinal disorders, notably gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease, are commonly seen in the elderly. This report reviews those age-related system changes that affect the gastrointestinal tract, and also reviews the esophageal and gastric disorders that are common and/or particularly problematic in the elderly. Diagnostic techniques to evaluate gastrointestinal disease in older patients and approaches to therapy for this population are described as well. 
Bedside diagnosis of preserved versus impaired left ventricular systolic function in heart failure. The importance of recognizing symptomatic heart failure with preserved left ventricular (LV) systolic function has only recently been appreciated. To determine its frequency and identify clinical features that make the bedside diagnosis likely, 82 patients admitted for decompensated heart failure were classified into 2 groups based on their LV systolic performance, as defined by fractional shortening (FS): group I (n = 59), with impaired systolic function (fractional shortening less than 24%), and group II (n = 23) with preserved systolic function (fractional shortening greater than or equal to 24%). Mean fractional shortening was 15 +/- 5% and 39 +/- 1% for groups I and II, respectively. Female gender (p less than 0.05), obesity (p less than 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) predominated in group II. Jugular venous distention was identified more frequently in group I (p less than 0.05). No statistically significant difference between the 2 groups was noted among various demographic variables (age, duration of symptoms, history of hypertension, ischemic heart disease and heavy alcohol drinking) or physical findings (S3 gallop, edema, cardiomegaly, pulmonary congestion and pulmonary edema). Echocardiographic mean left ventricular dimension measured 6.6 +/- 1 versus 5.0 +/- 1 cm (p less than 0.01) and mean posterior wall thickness 1.1 +/- 0.3 versus 1.4 +/- 0.4 cm (p less than 0.01) in group I and II, respectively. The combination of diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 105 mm Hg and an absence of jugular venous distention had a high specificity and positive predictive value (100%) for identifying group II patients. 
Tolerance and safety of pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with adenosine in association with thallium-201 scintigraphy in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Adenosine thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy is a promising test for coronary artery disease detection, but its safety has not been reported in large patient cohorts. Accordingly, the tolerance and safety profile of adenosine infusion were analyzed in 607 patients (351 men, 256 women, mean age 63 +/- 11 years) undergoing this test either because of suspected coronary artery disease (Group I, n = 482) or for risk stratification early (5.2 +/- 2.8 days) after myocardial infarction (Group II, n = 125). Adenosine increased the heart rate from 74.5 +/- 14.0 to 91.8 +/- 15.9 beats/min (p less than 0.001) and decreased systolic blood pressure from 137.8 +/- 26.8 to 120.7 +/- 26.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Side effects were frequent and similar in both groups. Flushing occurred in 35%, chest pain in 34%, headache in 21% and dyspnea in 19% of patients. Only 35.6% of Group I patients with chest pain during adenosine infusion had concomitant transient perfusion abnormalities, compared with 60.7% of Group II patients (p less than 0.05). First- and second-degree AV block occurred in 9.6% and 3.6% of patients, respectively, and ischemic ST changes in 12.5% of cases. Concomitance of chest pain and ischemic ST depression was uncommon (6%) but, when present, predicted perfusion abnormalities in 73% of patients. Most side effects ceased rapidly after stopping the adenosine infusion. The side effects were severe in only 1.6% of patients and in only six patients (1%) was it necessary to discontinue the infusion. No serious adverse reactions such as acute myocardial infarction or death occurred. 
Pituitary microcirculation: physiological aspects and clinical implications. A laser-Doppler flow study during transsphenoidal adenomectomy. The anterior and posterior pituitary lobes (AL and PL, respectively) are assumed to differ in the type of vascular supply and structure of their microvascular networks. Animal experiments have shown that the pituitary microvascular flow differs between the two lobes, being extremely high in the PL and low in the AL. For technical reasons, it has hitherto not been possible to study pituitary microflow in humans. Laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is now a well-established method for real-time monitoring of microcirculation, applicable also in humans. In a prospective clinical study, the microflow in the AL and PL was measured during transsphenoidal microsurgery in 52 patients with adenomas of different size, growth characteristics, and endocrinological activity. The mean microflow in the PL (177.7 +/- 12.6 [flux]) was found to be about six times higher than that in the AL (27.4 +/- 2.7 [flux]). No difference in the laser-Doppler fractional volume of the lobes could be detected (0.73 +/- 0.06 [] vs. 0.77 +/- 0.07 [], where [] designates the ratio of the alternating current output to the direct current output signals). Microflow within the pituitary lobes was influenced neither by the histological type nor the size of the adenoma. Additionally, LDF signal-averaging triggered by the electrocardiogram allowed detection of different characteristic pulsatile microvascular flow patterns in the AL and PL. Our findings provide strong physiological support for the idea that the angioarchitecture of the pituitary lobes differs. With this method, the AL and PL can be identified objectively during surgery. LDF might provide useful information concerning intraoperative surgical approach. 
The dorsal rat flap: a discussion of the model and the salutary effect of cimetidine on flap survival. Failure of skin flaps remains a significant clinical problem. The dorsal rat flap, a reliable experimental model, was used to test the efficacy of cimetidine in treating a failing flap. Flaps were elevated in 45 rats divided into three equal groups. Group 1 was a saline control group, Group 2 received cimetidine 250 mg/kg three times a day for 7 days postoperatively, and Group 3 received cimetidine for 1 day before surgery, and then as in Group 2. Necrosis was assessed on the seventh postoperative day. Group 2 had 31.1 +/- 1.3 (mean % +/- SEM) necrosis, significantly better than saline control animals (p less than 0.01) and pretreated animals (p less than 0.05). These results suggest the usefulness of cimetidine in ischemic flap surgery. 
Microvascular permeability increases early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury. To test the hypothesis that microvascular injury is involved in the pathophysiology of acid-induced esophagitis, the effect of acid perfusion on intraluminal plasma protein loss was studied in relation to histological changes. Four groups of opossums (n = 6 in each) were perfused with either normal saline control) or 10, 20, or 100 mmol/L isoosmolar hydrochloric acid at 2 mL/min for 90 minutes using a midesophageal catheter. The distal esophagus was cannulated via a gastrostomy, and the effluent was collected and measured for intraluminal loss of IV injected 125I-bovine serum albumin. Plasma protein loss in the control group was constant with a total loss of 3.40 +/- 0.69 mg/g dry wt. Perfusion of 10, 20, and 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid increased total protein loss to 8.06 +/- 2.62, 13.94 +/- 2.72, and 27.34 +/- 4.34 mg/g dry wt, respectively. The protein loss was not associated with intraluminal blood loss, as measured by previously injected 51Cr-labeled autologous red blood cells. Histological changes, scored by a blinded observer, were significant only between control animals and those perfused with 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid. Separate studies using the vascular tracer monastral blue B demonstrated an increase in labeling of lamina propria blood vessels that varied directly with the concentration of acid perfusate, thereby providing direct morphological evidence of microvascular injury. These studies suggest that increased microvascular permeability occurs early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury. 
Acute familial myositis with a common autoimmune response. In 1986, we diagnosed and treated 4 patients, all members of 1 rural family, who presented simultaneously with a polymyositis-like syndrome, anticytoplasmic antibodies (on HEp-2 cells), and precipitating antibodies of anti-Jo-1 and anti-PM-Scl specificities. Serum samples from these patients reacted by immunodiffusion against serum from a rodent that had been caught in the patients' house. The precipitin line showed complete immunologic identity with anti-Jo-1. To study the specificity of this serum-serum reaction, 2 mice (Mus musculus) and 1 rat (Rattus rattus) from the neighboring areas of the patients' house were caught and killed. Sections of the liver, kidney, spleen, and skeletal muscle were processed for histopathologic examination and for direct and indirect immunofluorescence studies of the patients' sera. The rodents' sera were tested by immunodiffusion against serum samples from 25 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 11 with rheumatoid arthritis, 6 with mixed connective tissue disease, and 11 with various other rheumatic diseases, as well as 16 healthy controls. A serum-serum precipitin reaction was noted between the rodents' sera and sera from 2 of the patients with polymyositis-like syndrome. A distinct, but weaker, reaction was found with 2 lupus patients' sera (8%), and with 1 healthy control serum (6%). The rodents' sera were antinuclear antibody positive by indirect immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells. These results, suggest that some rodents could be carriers of an as-yet-unknown transmissible agent that, in susceptible individuals, induces clinical and serologic manifestations similar to those of polymyositis. 
Osteoradionecrosis of sphenoid and temporal bones in a patient with maxillary sinus carcinoma: a case report. A case of radionecrosis of sphenoid and temporal bones is reported. The patient received a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for his left maxillary sinus carcinoma. After the combined therapy, necrosis accompanying inflammation developed in the maxillary and temporal regions. Excision of the necrotic tissues was done, and the left ascending ramus of the mandible was resected because of persistent tumor mass at the left infratemporal fossa. Although the excision wound of the maxilla healed by epithelialization, an area of nonvital bone remained exposed in the temporal region, where progressive osteonecrosis with infection led to breakdown of the skin. The necrotic bones of the zygomatic arch and the sphenotemporal sutural region became visible through the skin defect, and computerized tomography scan revealed bone necrosis involving the inferolateral area and the base of the skull. Excision of the necrotic bone and reconstruction with sternocleidomastoid myocutaneous flap were performed. 
Neonatal schizencephaly: comparison of brain imaging. Schizencephaly is a regional disturbance of cerebral hemisphere formation occurring at 3-5 months gestation; neonatal presentation is uncommon. Three neonates with schizencephaly were evaluated with cranial ultrasonography (US), unenhanced computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations. Common findings in US, CT, and MRI include parasylvian and midline clefts, size asymmetries of the basal ganglia and thalamus, cerebral parenchymal volume loss, ventriculomegaly, ventricular diverticula, and absence of the septum pellucidum. MRI and CT were superior to US in detecting calcification, gyral and sulcal abnormalities, and parasylvian clefts. MRI alone demonstrated homolateral absence of the sylvian vasculature, small medullary pyramids, low position of the fornix, and the thinning of the corpus callosum. Although US appears adequate as a screening test, MRI best defines the precise pathoanatomic findings of neonatal schizencephaly and allows for the prediction of neurologic outcomes in affected newborns. 
Use of photodynamic therapy in the palliation of massive advanced rectal cancer. Phase I/II study. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively new form of cancer therapy utilizing a photosensitizer such as hematoporphyrin derivative. We conducted a pilot study to determine the efficacy of its use in palliating advanced rectal cancer, to determine toxicity, and to establish objective outcome criteria. Six patients with very advanced, usually recurrent rectal cancer were treated with PDT after being photosensitized with Photofrin II. A protocol was established to measure clinical and radiologic response to therapy. A new intraluminal delivery system was incorporated. Five patients had both clinical and radiologic responses to therapy. In two patients we observed such significant responses that they cannot be accounted for on a photobiologic basis alone. One patient developed a significant sunburn after discharge. There was no major toxicity of bleeding or sepsis even at maximum doses (200 J/cm2). We are confident that PDT has a role to play in rectal cancer and speculate as to future applications. 
Results of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty as a palliative procedure in tetralogy of Fallot Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was attempted in 67 patients with tetralogy of Fallot at a median age of 5 months (range 0.03 to 52 months) for relief of cyanosis. In three patients, the valve could not be crossed and an aortopulmonary shunt was performed. In 35 patients, follow-up angiography was performed 3 to 30 months (average 12) after valvuloplasty. In 24 of these 35 patients (group A), the stenosis had been adequately palliated by valvuloplasty; the other 11 patients (group B) had required an aortopulmonary shunt 1 month (range 0 to 3 months) after valvuloplasty. The two groups were similar (p greater than 0.1) with respect to age at valvuloplasty, pulmonary anulus diameter, ratio of pulmonary artery to descending aorta diameter before valvuloplasty and interval to follow-up angiography. In contrast to patients in group B, patients in group A had a significant immediate improvement in systemic arterial oxygen saturation (p less than 0.01) and a significant increase in pulmonary anulus diameter at follow-up angiography (p less than 0.001). The growth of the branch pulmonary arteries was similar (p greater than 0.1) in the two groups. Among 42 patients who have had surgical correction, a transannular patch for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction was used in 27 (64%); there was no difference between groups A and B with respect to its use. Eight patients died (three after repair) and death could not be directly attributed to valvuloplasty in any. Balloon valvuloplasty promotes growth of the pulmonary valve anulus and pulmonary arteries and is a useful alternative to an aortopulmonary shunt in patients with small pulmonary arteries or associated complex intracardiac defects. 
Metastatic properties of the human prostatic cell line, PPC-1, in athymic nude mice. Limitation in the number of human prostatic cell lines has created a gap in knowledge regarding the in-vivo progression of this common cancer. The recently isolated primary prostatic carcinoma cell line, PPC-1, has been shown to be tumorigenic in athymic nude mice. These cells are now shown to form metastases to secondary sites in 10 of 12 animals in this initial study. Metastases were localized to lung and lymph nodes, and the tumor histology closely resembled that of the undifferentiated, rapidly dividing primary tumors. This is the first report describing the metastatic properties of a primary prostatic cancer cell line. PPC-1 cells are therefore likely to represent a good model system for the study of human prostate cancer progression. 
Myocardial calcifications in neonates and infants: a unique tissue reaction. The deposit of calcium salts into myocardial cells represents the process of dystrophic calcification. Once it causes alterations in cellular calcium hemostasis, it can initiate deleterious events leading to ischemic myocardial injury and cell death. Myocardial calcifications in infants are markedly different from those in adults; calcifications are significantly more frequent in cases of myocardial necrosis in the young, and can be demonstrated microscopically without removal of necrotic fibers and scar formation, which are the adult's usual stages of response to myocardial necrosis. Important functional and clinical implications in myocardial calcification, other than serving as a marker for necrosis, relate to accelerated myocardial calcification after cardiac surgery in infants. 
Prospective randomized trial comparing anal function after hand sewn ileoanal anastomosis with mucosectomy versus stapled ileoanal anastomosis without mucosectomy in restorative proctocolectomy. A prospective randomized trial was performed to compare complications and function after hand sewn ileoanal anastomosis with mucosectomy (group A) with stapled ileoanal anastomosis without mucosectomy (group B) during restorative proctocolectomy. Thirty-two age- and sex-matched consecutive patients under the care of one surgeon were randomized. The median duration of anal dilatation while making the anastomosis was 19 min (range 14-33 min) and 1 min (range 0-39 min) in groups A and B respectively (P less than 0.005). The median level of the anastomosis was at the dentate line (range 0-0.5 cm) in group A and 2 cm above the dentate line (range 0.2-4.0 cm) in group B (P less than 0.005). Seven patients in group A and 11 in group B had at least one postoperative complication (n.s.). One patient in group A and four in group B developed an anastomotic stricture requiring dilatation (n.s.). One patient in group B had the reservoir removed. Function was assessed at a median of 11 months (range 7-15 months) after ileostomy closure in 14 patients in group A, and at a median of 12 months (range 5-17 months) in 14 patients in group B. Median frequency of defaecation per 24 h was 4 in both groups (group A, range 2-7; group B, range 2-10). Night evacuation (greater than once per week) occurred in seven patients in each group. All patients in both groups could delay the desire to defaecate by more than 30 min. Eleven patients in group A and 12 in group B had normal continence. Evidence to date favours a full mucosectomy. Function is not vitiated by this technique and surgical removal of the disease is more complete. 
Effect of mild hyperthermia on the ischemic infarct volume after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. We investigated the effect of mild whole-body hyperthermia (40 degrees C) on a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model in Fisher rats by subjecting them to MCAo under the following conditions: (1) normothermia (n = 20); (2) hyperthermia (n = 14) before (1 hour), during, and after (1 hour) MCAo; and (3) post-MCAo hyperthermia (n = 14) for 1 hour. We measured brain and body temperatures during the experiment using micro-thermocouples and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability using Evans blue staining of the brain. We measured the volume of the infarcted brain tissue 4 days after MCAo. We detected no differences in BBB permeability among three groups. The volume of infarcted tissue was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) for the two groups of hyperthermic animals than the normothermic animals. Our data suggest that mild hyperthermia, both during and after induction of ischemia, has a detrimental effect on the ischemic infarct volume in this model. 
Inner ear deafness in Wegener's granulomatosis. Autoimmune deafness represents a heterogeneous group of disorders in which there is though to be inner ear and/or middle ear damage mediated by various immunological abnormalities. We describe a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis in whom there was evidence of significant inner ear damage caused by vasculitis, which was completely reversed by cyclophosphamide and prednisolone. We propose that Wegener's granulomatosis is a cause of autoimmune deafness. 
Epidemiology of nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia during the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic. To assess the impact of the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic on nontyphoidal Salmonella septicemia and to identify risk factors for this infection, national laboratory-based Salmonella surveillance data and AIDS case reports were analyzed. Among 25- to 49-year-old men in states with a high incidence of AIDS, the proportion of Salmonella isolates reported from blood increased from 2.8% in 1978-1982 to 14.2% in 1983-1987, with substantial increases for serotypes enteritidis and typhimurium. Of adolescents and adults reported with AIDS from September 1987 through March 1990, 337 (0.48%) had recurrent Salmonella septicemia, with higher proportions among those who resided in the Northeast (0.86%), had a history of intravenous drug use (0.79%), or were black (0.74%) or Hispanic (0.57%). These data suggest that the risk of Salmonella septicemia in persons with AIDS is affected by geographic prevalence of Salmonella species, host characteristics, and invasiveness of infecting strains. 
Usefulness of a writing device in writer's cramp. Fifteen of 20 patients with writer's cramp treated with a writing device noted an improvement in their writing ability, some quite marked. Despite this benefit, nine patients preferred to use alternate methods. In the absence of adverse effects, we suggest that trials of writing devices be the first recourse for all patients with writer's cramp requiring treatment. 
Renal transplant arterial thrombosis: association with cyclosporine. Of 136 patients who received a renal transplant between January 1984 and August 1988, there were six cases (4.4%) of allograft arterial thrombosis (AAT) occurring a mean of 23 days after transplantation. All were maintained on cyclosporine A(CsA) in addition to prednisone and azathioprine. All transplants were performed by the same transplant surgeon. Five of the six episodes (83%) were in allografts that had multiple renal arteries (MRA), giving an incidence of AAT in that group of 36%. Only one of 122 (0.8%) allografts with a single renal artery experienced thrombosis. CsA was started a mean of 9 days after transplantation (range, 16 to 33 days). There was no correlation of AAT to CsA levels. AAT appears to be an early complication of allografts with MRA in patients maintained on CsA. 
The effect of intravenous flumazenil on interictal electroencephalographic epileptic activity: results of a placebo-controlled study. The effect on interictal electroencephalographic epileptic activity of intravenous flumazenil (Ro 15-1788), a benzodiazepine antagonist and potential antiepileptic drug, was studied in 10 patients. Comparison was made with intravenous diazepam (10 mg) and placebo using a single-blind, single-dose, cross-over design. A dose of 3 mg flumazenil was well tolerated and produced a significantly greater reduction in the number of epileptic transients during the first 40 minutes after injection than did placebo (p less than 0.05). This effect was similar to that of diazepam in magnitude and duration. When flumazenil (3 mg) was administered immediately after intravenous diazepam (10 mg), the reduction in interictal epileptic activity was not significantly different from that produced by diazepam alone. The results suggest that either flumazenil has intrinsic antiepileptic activity and in this respect acts as a partial agonist at the benzodiazepine receptor, or that it is antagonising an endogenous proconvulsant ligand in these patients. 
Efficacy and safety of intravenous and oral propafenone in pediatric cardiac dysrhythmias. Propafenone was administered to 58 patients with a mean age of 3.2 years (range 0.1 to 16). Mean intravenous dose was 1.2 mg/kg body weight (range 0.3 to 1.5 mg). The final mean oral maintenance dose was 308 mg/m2 body surface area (range 200 to 600 mg/m2, 16.8 mg/kg body weight). After intravenous application, propafenone was effective in 21 of 36 patients; atrial flutter was converted in 1 of 5 patients, and reentry supraventricular tachycardia was controlled in 15 of 25 patients. Propafenone was partially or completely effective in 3 of 4 patients with chaotic atrial tachycardia. Junctional ectopic tachycardia was suppressed in 2 infants. Thirty-seven patients had oral treatment with a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. Propafenone was effective in 33 of 37 patients (89%); atrial flutter was controlled in 2 patients, ventricular ectopy was suppressed in 1 of 2 patients. In reentry supraventricular tachycardia, propafenone was effective in 25 of 28 patients. Chaotic atrial tachycardia (n = 3) and junctional ectopic tachycardia (n = 2) were controlled after successful intravenous therapy. Systemic side effects were rare. Two patients developed a proarrhythmic effect, and 1 patient with ventricular ectopy after repair of tetralogy of Fallot died suddenly during propafenone maintenance therapy. 
Squamous cell carcinoma of the umbilicus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A variety of malignancies, including hematologic malignancies, Kaposi's sarcoma, as well as adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinoma have been reported in association with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Tumors of the umbilical area are unusual and can represent lesions of urachal origin. These may require extensive resection and are associated with a poor prognosis. We describe here a case of a young woman with AIDS who developed a squamous cell carcinoma of the umbilicus which suggests more than a casual relationship between these two conditions. 
Outcome of extensive coronary artery dissection during coronary angioplasty. A total of 32 (3.6%) patients of 880 undergoing coronary angioplasty during a nine year period at one hospital had extensive dissection (defined as a dissection extending beyond the limits of the dilated angioplasty balloon) in the coronary artery in which the angioplasty procedure was performed. Two (6.25%) of the 32 patients (both of whom were undergoing angioplasty because of unstable angina that was refractory to medical treatment) died as a consequence of the coronary artery dissection. Twelve (38%) needed immediate coronary artery bypass surgery and 11 (34%) had a myocardial infarction, which in four was minor in extent. During follow up, 20 of the 32 patients were successfully managed by medical treatment; only two needed further angioplasty procedures. There were no late deaths. Extensive coronary artery dissection is a serious complication of coronary angioplasty, with a high early mortality and a high incidence of infarction and requirement for bypass surgery. None the less, patients with extensive dissection who are free from the manifestations of acute ischaemia at the end of the procedure can be managed conservatively and have a good immediate and medium term outlook. Attempts should be made to stabilise extensive dissection during coronary angioplasty so that surgical intervention can be delayed or avoided altogether if possible. 
Early gold weight eyelid implantation for facial paralysis. Facial paralysis can result in serious keratopathy because of corneal exposure and inadequate lacrimation. Thirty-seven patients underwent thirty-eight gold weight upper lid implants to rehabilitate paralysis of the eyelid from various causes. When indicated, implantation was combined with lower lid ectropion repair, medial canthoplasty or brow lift. Because of encouraging results in patients with longstanding facial paralysis, "early" implantation (within 1 month of paralysis) was offered to patients with severe lagophthalmos in whom (1) a severe neural injury was documented at the time of transtemporal surgery or (2) delayed, incomplete return of function was expected. Gold weight implantation resulted in excellent eyelid closure, protection, and cosmesis. There were no infections or extrusions. Lagophthalmos and exposure keratitis resolved or were significantly improved in all patients, and most were able to dispense with eyedrops and salves. Visual acuity improved in 95% of patients--a benefit even those without preoperative keratitis often achieved. A mild worsening of one patient's pre-existing astigmatism developed, which resolved after reimplantation with a lighter weight. The implant is easily removed from those patients who, having undergone early implantation, eventually recover adequate function. Gold weight loading has become our procedure of choice for eyelid rehabilitation. 
Low-dose aspirin therapy for chronic stable angina. A randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of low-dose aspirin in the primary prevention of myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina. DESIGN: A randomized, double-blind, trial. PATIENTS: The study included 333 men with baseline chronic stable angina but with no previous history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or transient ischemic attack who were enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study, a trial of aspirin among 22,071 male physicians. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive alternate-day aspirin therapy (325 mg) or placebo and were followed for an average of 60.2 months for the occurrence of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death. RESULTS: During follow-up, 27 patients had confirmed myocardial infarctions; 7 were among the 178 patients with chronic stable angina who received aspirin therapy and 20 were among the 155 patients who received placebo (relative risk, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.63; P = 0.003). While simultaneously controlling for other cardiovascular risk factors in a proportional hazards model, an overall 87% risk reduction was calculated (relative risk, 0.13; CI, 0.04 to 0.42; P less than 0.001). For the subgroup of patients with chronic stable angina but no previous coronary bypass surgery or coronary angioplasty, an almost identical reduction in the risk for myocardial infarction was found (relative risk, 0.14; CI, 0.04 to 0.56; P = 0.006). Of 13 strokes, 11 occurred in the aspirin group and 2 in the placebo group (relative risk, 5.4; CI, 1.3 to 22.1; P = 0.02). No stroke was fatal, but 4 produced some long-term impairment of function. One stroke, in the aspirin group, was hemorrhagic. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that alternate-day aspirin therapy greatly reduced the risk for first myocardial infarction among patients with chronic stable angina, a group of patients at high risk for cardiovascular death (P less than 0.001). Although our results for stroke were based on small numbers, they suggested an apparent increase in frequency of stroke with aspirin therapy; this finding requires confirmation in randomized trials of adequate sample size. 
Hemodynamic determinants of exercise capacity in chronic heart failure. PURPOSE: To synthesize information on hemodynamic determinants of exercise capacity in patients with chronic heart failure. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Relevant studies published from the mid-1960s to the present were identified by a manual search of the English-language literature and by bibliographic review of pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION: Both controlled and observational studies that reported measures of either exercise time or oxygen uptake and hemodynamic variables in patients with heart failure were reviewed for quality and included when relevant to the discussion. DATA EXTRACTION: Key conclusions or data, or both, were extracted from each article and described. DATA SYNTHESIS: Exercise intolerance is a hallmark of chronic congestive heart failure. Studies have emphasized central factors and indices of systolic ventricular function, but poor relations have been consistently found between these measurements and exercise capacity. Recent data suggest that diastolic function (that is, ventricular filling and compliance) is an important factor affecting the ability to increase cardiac output and determining exercise capacity, but this issue needs further study. A clearer picture of histologic and biochemical abnormalities in skeletal muscle has recently emerged; patients with heart failure show greater glycolysis, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, and reduced oxidative enzyme activity. Vasodilatory abnormalities in heart failure were first described more than 20 years ago, and such abnormalities may underlie recently reported reductions in skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise. Relative hyperventilation is commonly observed during exercise in patients with heart failure and is related to ventilation-perfusion mismatching in the lung due to a higher-than-normal fraction of physiologic dead space. Neurohumoral abnormalities include reductions in beta-receptor density and sensitivity and contribute to reduced inotropic and chronotropic responses to exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Systolic function and exercise capacity are unrelated in patients with chronic heart failure, but many hemodynamic abnormalities (including those in the heart, lung, and skeletal muscle) overlap, which leads to exercise intolerance in these patients. 
Massive ST-segment elevation without myocardial injury in a patient with fulminant hepatic failure and cerebral edema. A 49-year-old woman presented in fulminant hepatic failure. The ECG showed dramatic ST-segment elevation, suggesting diffuse myocardial injury. However, echocardiography, creatine phosphokinase enzyme determinations, and examination of the heart at autopsy (six days later) failed to demonstrate any physiologic, anatomic, or histologic evidence of abnormality. The appearance of ST-segment elevation in this setting should not prompt treatment for cardiac disease or limit the candidacy for liver transplantation of such critically ill patients. 
Oral Kaposi's sarcoma in a woman as a first indication of HIV infection. Although Kaposi's sarcoma has been well described in homosexual men at risk for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, there have been fewer reports of KS in women, and most of these have been in women who became infected with HIV through intravenous drug use. This report describes a woman who had no history of intravenous drug use in whom intraoral KS and hairy leukoplakia were the first indication of her infection with HIV. 
Tumor cytokinetic response to total parenteral nutrition in patients with head and neck cancers. Refeeding of patients with malignant tumors may induce tumor-cell DNA synthesis. The present study was aimed at evaluating whether induction of altered cell-cycle kinetics could be induced by intravenous total parenteral nutrition (TPN) in tumor biopsies from head and neck cancers. Nine malnourished patients with squamous cell carcinoma in the head-and-neck area were investigated before and after 5-7 d of continuous TPN. Tumor biopsies were taken in both fasted and fed states for determination of 1) ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity, which is rate limiting for polyamine synthesis; 2) flow-cytometric-DNA-distribution measurements; and 3) the fraction of proliferating cells expressed as immunohistochemical reactivity with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. The histopathological differentiation, the fraction of aneuploidic cells, ODC activity, and Ki-67 reactivity were not significantly related to each other, although the number of aneuploidic cells in replicative phases correlated with the number of cells expressing the Ki-67 antigen (r = 0.86, P less than 0.01). Tumor cytokinetics showed no evidence of being changed by TPN administration. 
Molecular biology of hypertension. Hypertension results from abnormalities of the control systems that normally regulate blood pressure. These control systems include vascular, cardiogenic, renal, neurogenic, and endocrine mechanisms that interact in a complex but integrated manner to achieve blood pressure homeostasis. Multiple endogenous biologically active substances participate in the regulation of these control systems. Evidence suggests that abnormalities of these regulatory mechanisms resulting from altered genetic and environmental interactions play an important role in the pathogenesis of primary hypertension. Once hypertension develops, it tends to be self-perpetuating via amplifying mechanisms mediated by secondary structural changes in the blood vessels, heart, and kidney. These adaptative structural changes amplify and perpetuate hypertension by increasing systemic vascular resistance, enhancing cardiac output, and impairing renal sodium and water excretion. The long-term sequelae of hypertensive structural changes in these end organs are complications of atherosclerotic vascular disease, cardiac hypertrophy and failure, stroke, and renal failure. With the tools of molecular biology, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these abnormalities has increased enormously and continues to grow at a rapid pace, as illustrated by the discussion that follows. Our review of the molecular biology of hypertension will address systematically four key areas: 1) molecular biology of the control systems, 2) molecular mechanisms of cardiovascular structural changes, 3) genetics of hypertension, and 4) application of transgenic technology in studies of hypertension. 
Hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia: specific findings at dynamic contrast-enhanced US with carbon dioxide microbubbles. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) with intraarterial infusion of carbon dioxide microbubbles was performed for four cases of histologically proved focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in four patients and for 167 cases of various hepatic nodules in 144 patients. No complications due to dynamic US were observed in any of the 148 patients. All FNH nodules were less than 3 cm in diameter. Consistent specific findings of FNH were not obtained with US, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiocolloid scanning, or angiography in the four cases of FNH. In contrast, the characteristic vascular pattern (ie, early central hypervascular supply with centrifugal filling to the periphery at the arterial phase and a uniform or lobulated dense stain at the capillary phase) was observed in all four cases of FNH with dynamic US. This vascular pattern demonstrated in FNH with dynamic US was not seen in any of the 167 hepatic nodules, including 44 small hepatocellular carcinomas less than 3 cm in diameter. Therefore, the newly developed, dynamic contrast-enhanced US technique seems to be extremely sensitive and specific for diagnosing FNH and is useful in the differentiation of FNH from other hepatic tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Global T wave inversion. Because global T wave inversion has not been specifically characterized, 100 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with this pattern (frontal plane T vector -100 degrees to -170 degrees with precordial T inversion) were prospectively collected from approximately 30,000 consecutively interpreted ECGs and analyzed blindly. There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs. 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions. There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs. -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034). The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36). Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization. Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion. Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries. 
Twenty-four-hour activity of felodipine extended release in chronic stable angina pectoris. To investigate the antiischemic efficacy and duration of action of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine, 15 patients with stable exertional angina were enrolled in a double-blind, crossover study comparing 2 doses (5 and 10 mg) of felodipine extended release (ER) and placebo given once daily for 1 week. Bicycle exercise tests were repeated at the end of each treatment period 4 and 24 hours after dosing. Four hours after dosing with both felodipine doses, only 5 patients discontinued the exercise test because of greater than 2 mm of ST-segment depression, whereas 10 continued until exhaustion (p less than 0.01 vs placebo). Compared with placebo, total exercise time was increased by 19% (p less than 0.001), with no difference between doses. After 24 hours, exercise duration was prolonged up to physical exhaustion in 6 patients taking felodipine 10 mg (p less than 0.05 vs both placebo and felodipine 5 mg); moreover, 11 patients taking 10 mg and 5 taking 5 mg increased time to 1 mm of ST depression greater than or equal to 15% compared with exercise time during the placebo test. Mean time to 1 mm of ST depression at 24 hours was increased by 8% with 5 mg and by 18% with 10 mg (p less than 0.001 vs placebo; p less than 0.01 between doses). Total exercise time at 24 hours was increased with both doses (p less than 0.001), with greater efficacy with the 10-mg dose (p less than 0.05 vs 5 mg). 
Comparison of patient-controlled analgesia and epidural morphine for postcesarean pain and recovery. A greater awareness of the advantages and limitations of new methods of administering postcesarean analgesia would help the obstetrician care for the recovering patient. Patient-controlled analgesia and epidural morphine are two new modalities for postoperative pain relief. The purpose of this prospective investigation was to compare their effectiveness, safety, side effects, patient satisfaction and cost. During an eight-month period, 161 women undergoing cesarean delivery were assigned to receive narcotics by either epidural morphine (76 patients) or patient-controlled analgesia (85 patients) using a combined continuous infusion and demand dosing of meperidine. The demographic characteristics of the two groups were similar. Mild or no pain was reported with similar frequencies in both groups. No reduced respiration or undesired sedation was seen in either group. The postoperative times before sitting at the bedside, ambulating, tolerating clear liquids and leaving the hospital were also comparable. No complications were encountered with patient-controlled analgesia, but pruritus and alarms from apnea monitors occurred commonly in the epidural morphine group. The costs to the patient were similar for the two groups. Patient-controlled analgesia using a combined continuous infusion and demand dosing is an acceptable alternative to epidural morphine after cesarean delivery. 
Prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting using ondansetron, a new, selective, 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The effect of ondansetron, a 5-HT3 antagonist, in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting was investigated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 84 patients undergoing gynecologic operation and receiving the same general anesthetic. The patients received premedication with either 16 mg oral ondansetron, or a matching placebo. The same medication was given postoperatively 8 h after the first dose. During the first hour after recovery from anesthesia, the frequencies of nausea and vomiting were 52% and 40%, respectively, in patients given placebos. In the ondansetron group nausea and vomiting developed in 17% and 12%, respectively, values significantly different from those with placebos (P less than 0.005). Similar differences were observed throughout the entire 24-h period after recovery, the incidence of nausea and vomiting being 67% and 60%, respectively, in the placebo group and 29% and 26% in the ondansetron treatment group. Ondansetron appears to be a promising antiemetic for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. 
Detection of intraoperative laser injury to the facial nerve by electromyographic monitoring of facial muscles. Injury to the facial nerve is a significant risk during resection of cerebellopontine angle tumors. To minimize the risk of facial nerve injury, intraoperative electromyographic monitoring of facial musculature is frequently used. However, the reliability of such monitoring systems for detection of thermal nerve injury resulting from the use of carbon dioxide lasers has not been systematically evaluated. We determined the sensitivity of a computerized electromyographic monitor for detection of laser facial nerve injury in an anesthetized rat model. The mandibular and buccal branches of the facial nerve were isolated in 12 rats. A carbon dioxide laser was used to create controlled sites of thermal injury to both nerves over a 3-hour period. When a laser injury was created distal to previous injury sites, electromyographic discharge was noted in 72% to 82% of injuries. Laser injury proximal to previous injury sites was detected with 33% efficiency. These detection rates did not change significantly over a 3-hour period. This preliminary data suggests that electromyographic monitoring of facial musculature allows detection of facial nerve injury caused by carbon dioxide lasers. 
Bacteriology of the appendix and the ileum in health and in appendicitis. The bacteriology of the ileum and the appendix in appendicitis patients with or without perforation and compared with patients who had "incidental appendectomy" was studied. Of 42 appendicitis patients, 24 (57%) of them had anaerobic bacteria in the appendix compared with two of eight (25%) with normal appendix. Anaerobes were found in the ileal aspirates of 20 of 42 (47.6%) appendicitis patients and two of eight (25%) in normal persons. This suggests that anaerobic bacteria increasingly colonize the appendix and the ileum in cases of appendicitis. 
Possible mechanism of vascular reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. We studied the effects of urokinase (UK), pro-urokinase (pro-UK), and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on platelet aggregation and the production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) in vitro. Both UK and pro-UK inhibited the platelet aggregation induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), collagen, or thrombin in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, although a low dose of rt-PA (5 to 10 x 10(4) U/ml) blunted platelet aggregability, a high dose (40 to 60 x 10(4) U/ml) led to platelet hyperaggregation. UK and pro-UK markedly inhibited TXA2 synthesis during ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Despite the significant reduction of TXA2 synthesis by 10 x 10(4) U/ml rt-PA, a concentration of 60 x 10(4) U/ml rt-PA had no effect on synthesis. These results indicate that UK and pro-UK each inhibit platelet function, but a high concentration of rt-PA enhances platelet aggregability. This finding may at least in part contribute to the high incidence of reocclusion after initially successful thrombolysis with rt-PA. 
Treatment of bone, joint, and vascular-access-associated gram-positive bacterial infections with teicoplanin. Teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, was evaluated for safety and efficacy in the treatment of vascular-access-associated bacteremias and of bone and joint infections due to susceptible gram-positive organisms. Of 35 patients enrolled, 26 had osteomyelitis, 8 had vascular-access-associated bacteremias, and 1 had a joint infection. A total of 38 gram-positive isolates were identified: 23 Staphylococcus aureus and 6 coagulase-negative staphylococcus and 9 streptococcus isolates. After at least 6 months of follow-up, 17 patients were evaluable for efficacy: 10 of 14 (71%) with osteomyelitis and 3 of 3 with vascular-access-associated bacteremias had full resolution of their infections. Inadequate debridement, the presence of metal, and inadequate dosing were likely causes of two failures and two relapses in patients with osteomyelitis. For all but two organisms, teicoplanin MICs were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. Patients who responded had median peak and trough serum bactericidal levels at serum dilutions of 1:64 and 1:16; trough levels of teicoplanin in serum were greater than 30 micrograms/ml. Patients did not respond as expected to daily doses of 4 mg/kg of body weight, which consequently were increased to greater than or equal to 15 mg/kg. Audiology testing of 20 patients found 2 with a mild loss of high-frequency hearing; 1 patient complained of tinnitus. Patients tolerated peak levels in serum as high as 127 micrograms/ml and trough levels of 49 micrograms/ml. However, 5 of 18 patients (28%) whose daily dose was greater than or equal to 12 mg/kg developed drug fever and rash and had teicoplanin discontinued. Further study of the antibiotic at such higher doses is needed. 
The clinical spectrum of hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases. Malignancy-related hypocalcaemia has received less attention in the literature than the opposite perturbation, hypercalcaemia. Only, scarce and contradictory data exist about hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases (BMH). We have reviewed the clinical records of 155 patients with bone metastases of solid tumours, 122 of which were followed during the whole course of the disease until death. The frequency of hypocalcaemia ranged from 5 to 13%, depending on the formula used to correct calcium values for protein concentration. BMH was almost exclusively limited to patients with osteoblastic metastases. The frequency of BMH among patients with prostate carcinoma was 13-27%, depending on the formula used. Only two of 60 patients with lytic bone lesions presented hypocalcaemia, and in both cases it was rather mild. The development of hypocalcaemia did not seem to imply a worse prognosis, at least in patients with carcinoma of the prostate. Thus, the prevalence of BMH appears to be higher than is usually considered. Adequate attention should be given to this disorder because of the potentially deleterious effects on several organ systems. 
Update on esophageal radiology. This article reviews the current status of double-contrast radiography in diagnosing pharyngeal tumors and opportunistic esophagitis and the radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility disorders in patients with chest pain. Double-contrast pharyngography is a valuable technique for detecting pharyngeal tumors. These lesions may be manifested by an intraluminal mass, mucosal irregularity, or asymmetric distensibility. Furthermore, barium studies may demonstrate lesions involving the valleculae, tongue base, lower hypopharynx, and pharyngoesophageal segment that are difficult to visualize at endoscopy. Double-contrast radiography is also a valuable technique for detecting opportunistic esophagitis and for differentiating the underlying causes. Mucosal plaques should suggest Candida esophagitis, whereas discrete ulcers should suggest herpes esophagitis, and one or more large, relatively flat ulcers should suggest cytomegalovirus esophagitis. Finally, in evaluating patients with chest pain, in only a small percentage are esophageal motility disorders found to be a possible cause of their pain. Instead, the majority are found to have cardiac disease, structural esophageal lesions, or gastroesophageal reflux, so that barium studies are more useful in documenting normal motility or structural abnormalities in these patients. 
Diagnosis of segmental necrosis in a pancreas transplant by thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy. Thallium-201 was used to image a patient with a pancreatic transplant. Incomplete visualization of the graft on the 201Tl scan, compared to CT, led to the diagnosis of segmental necrosis of the tail of the graft. Due to the low background and favorable target-to-non-target ratio, 201Tl pancreas scintigraphy may be useful in the follow-up of pancreatic transplants. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of intractable complex partial seizures: pathologic and electroencephalographic correlation. Prior studies indicate variable usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of patients with complex partial seizures (CPS), but sensitivities as low as 12% have been reported. We analyzed the MRI examinations of 20 patients with medically refractory CPS who later underwent resection of the seizure focus proven by electroencephalography (EEG). MRI studies were correlated with surgical pathology in all patients. Eleven of the 20 CPS patients had mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS). Seven of the 11 (64%) exhibited an MRI abnormality at the site of the EEG-demonstrated histopathologic focus. MRI abnormalities included temporal lobe hypoplasia or atrophy (four patients), and increased signal intensity on long repetition time (TR) sequences (three patients). Four patients had no MRI abnormalities corresponding to the histopathologic focus. Nine of the 20 CPS patients had other abnormalities responsible for the seizures, including astrocytoma, cryptic vascular malformation, hamartoma, polymicrogyria, tuberous sclerosis (forme fruste), arachnoid cyst, and congenital hemiatrophy. No patient had normal MRI studies. Our single most useful MRI sequence was the coronal long TR/dual echo sequence, using cardiac gating and first-order gradient moment nulling to diminish flow-related artifacts that could hinder evaluation of medial temporal lobe structures. 
Electromyographic activity of selected leg musculature in subjects with normal and chronically sprained ankles performing on a BAPS board. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the magnitude and temporal features of tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and gastrocnemius muscle activity during exercises performed on a Biomechanical Ankle Platform System (BAPS) board by subjects with normal and chronically sprained ankles. Fourteen participants in each of the two groups rotated the platform in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions at self-selected velocities. Trials were completed with both medium- and large-sized hemispheres under the platform while electromyographic surface recordings were made from the three muscles of interest. Electromyographic values, normalized within individuals as a percentage of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), ranged from 20% to 80% of MVIC. An analysis of variance for the average myoelectric signals from all three muscles revealed no differences between the two groups. Effects of direction and hemisphere size were shown for all muscles. The large hemisphere produced significantly greater average activity and a more pronounced effect on the tibialis anterior muscle. The data provide information on the level of muscle activity required for conditions used in this study and may assist the physical therapist with making judgments about the use of this device in rehabilitation programs. 
Pancreatic-portal vein fistula with disseminated fat necrosis treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy. I have reported the case of a 62-year-old man with chronic alcoholic pancreatitis and a rare pseudocyst-portal vein fistula. Even though he experienced no abdominal symptoms, he had severe metastatic fat necrosis manifested as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, medullary bone necrosis, and mental status changes. Remote tissue destruction continued until relief was gained by pancreaticoduodenectomy and repair of the necrotic portal vein. Disseminated fat necrosis is a rare syndrome that can be the only presenting feature in patients with pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. Early recognition and treatment of the underlying pancreatic disease may decrease the high morality rate associated with this syndrome. 
Histopathological studies of a new liquid embolization method using estrogen-alcohol and polyvinyl acetate. Experimental evaluations with a model of cortical arterial cannulation in the canine brain. This experimental report evaluates the histopathological effects of a new embolization method using estrogen-alcohol (E-A) and polyvinyl acetate solution (PVac) as tested on 21 mongrel dogs. Three other animals treated with normal saline served as controls. All agents were introduced through an isolated cortical artery. Estrogen-alcohol induced immediate occlusion of small vessels (less than 20 microns), and then progressive obstruction of larger ones (200-300 microns) within several days. Animals treated with PVac showed vascular obliteration (greater than 100 microns) and moderate chronic fibrosis. The effects of embolization using E-A followed by PVac were found to have the combined advantages of both materials, showing diffuse occlusion of the vascular network with less tissue reaction. Hyalinization of embolized vessels with extensive fibrosis occurred afterward. For 6 weeks there was no evidence of recanalization or foreign body giant cell reaction. This study shows that E-A and PVac are capable of producing vascular occlusions with only mild tissue reaction. Because they are easily controllable and have no adverse effects, they may be suitable for intravascular application in the central nervous system. 
ACE inhibitors in the elderly. As the population with hypertension becomes older, it is important to determine the properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the elderly. The pharmacokinetics and efficacy of captopril, enalapril, and a new once-daily ACE inhibitor, quinapril for the treatment of hypertension in young and elderly patients are reviewed, and the safety profiles of these agents in young and elderly patients are discussed. Although the safely profile of all three drugs is very favorable, quinapril tended to be better tolerated by patients of all ages in comparative clinical trials. 
Ultrasonic decalcification of the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement. Aortic valve replacement for calcifica aortic stenosis requires meticulous debridement of the aortic annulus to effect optimal valve seating. Since 1987, we have used ultrasonic energy to debride the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement in 56 patients. In our experience, ultrasonic debridement of the annulus is superior to traditional methods of debridement, affords improved seating of the valve, and may allow placement of a larger valve. Our follow-up ranges from 2 to 32 months (mean follow-up, 13 +/- 9 months) with 0% incidence of paravalvular leak or valve failure. We advocate the use of ultrasonic debridement as an adjunctive tool in aortic valve replacement. 
Fundus photographic risk factors for progression of diabetic retinopathy. ETDRS report number 12. Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study Research Group. In the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study, a randomized clinical trial sponsored by the National Eye Institute, one eye of each patient was assigned to early photocoagulation and the other to deferral of photocoagulation (i.e., careful follow-up and initiation of photocoagulation only if high-risk proliferative retinopathy developed). This design allowed observation of the natural course of diabetic retinopathy in the initially untreated eye. Gradings of baseline stereoscopic fundus photographs of eyes with nonproliferative retinopathy assigned to deferral of photocoagulation were used to examine the power of various abnormalities and combinations of abnormalities to predict progression to proliferative retinopathy in photographs taken at the 1-, 3-, and 5-year follow-up visits. Severity of intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, hemorrhages and/or microaneurysms, and venous beading were found to be the most important factors in predicting progression. On the basis of these analyses and other considerations, a retinopathy severity scale was developed. This scale, which divides diabetic retinopathy into 13 levels ranging from absence of retinopathy to severe vitreous hemorrhage, can be used to describe overall retinopathy severity and change in severity over time. 
Effectiveness of histopathological diagnoses in dysfunction of hepatic transplantation. Review of 146 histopathological studies from 53 transplants. In 47 patients who underwent 53 liver transplantations and immunosuppression with cyclosporine (cyclosporin A), methylprednisolone sodium succinate, and antithymocyte globulin, 146 histopathological studies were performed (138 biopsies, six hepatectomies, and two autopsies). The following microscopical diagnoses were made: 43 acute rejections (29.4%), six chronic rejections (4.1%), 18 liver blood perfusion changes (12.3%), 15 biliary changes (10.2%), 10 cases of functional cholestasis (6.8%), two drug reactions (1.3%), two hepatitis B virus recurrences (1.3%), 11 opportunistic viral infections (7.5%), 18 minimal changes (12.3%), two nonclassifiable changes (1.3%), and 19 plurietiological changes (13%). A histopathological diagnosis of acute rejection was made in 31 transplants (58.4%). In 22 (71%) of them, acute rejection was diagnosed with the protocol biopsy specimen that was obtained during the second posttransplant week. Leukocyte counts and serum bilirubin and enzyme levels were obtained on the same day that the hepatic biopsy specimens were taken. There was no significant statistical difference between the mean serum data that accompanied each histopathological diagnosis, allowing identification of a characteristic biochemical profile for the causes of graft dysfunction. We report a detailed description of the microscopical findings of each diagnosis and the following conclusions: (1) Acute rejection is the most frequent cause of hepatic dysfunction and has an early appearance during the posttransplant period. (2) Histopathological findings can identify the causes of the dysfunction. (3) There is no specific biochemical pattern to differentiate these causes. This may be due to the frequent combination of etiological factors in every dysfunction episode. 
Safety of surgical procedures performed by residents. The outcome of surgical procedures on the gallbladder performed by surgical residents in a university hospital was compared with the outcome of those performed by the attending staff. More than 60% of the operations (643/1084) were done by residents under the direct supervision of the attending surgeon. We found no differences in the rate of technical complications, postoperative morbidity and mortality, or length of hospitalization between the two groups. Thus, resident surgery under appropriate guidance is safe and does not compromise the quality of patient care or operative outcome. 
Low-dose chemotherapy with central nervous system prophylaxis and zidovudine maintenance in AIDS-related lymphoma. A prospective multi-institutional trial. OBJECTIVE.--To ascertain if low-dose multiagent chemotherapy, with central nervous system prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy, might be associated with increased efficacy and decreased risk of intercurrent infection in patients with malignant lymphoma related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN.--A phase II prospective clinical trial, with median follow-up of 33 months. SETTING.--Eight university hospitals, within the context of the AIDS Clinical Trials Units, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. PATIENTS.--Forty-two patients with AIDS-related malignant lymphoma. All were evaluable for toxicity assessment, and 35 for response. INTERVENTION.--A low-dose modification of the M-BACOD regimen (day 1): cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2 intravenously (IV); doxorubicin, 25 mg/m2 IV; vincristine sulfate, 1.4 mg/m2 IV; bleomycin, 4 mg/m2 IV; dexamethasone, 3 mg/m2 orally on days 1 through 5; methotrexate, 500 mg/m2 IV on day 15, with leucovorin rescue. Intrathecal cytosine arabinoside (50 mg) to all on days 1, 8, 21, and 28, with radiation therapy to a helmet field to those with central nervous system involvement. Zidovudine for 12 months after completion of four to six cycles of chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Response rate and number of opportunistic infections. RESULTS.--Response rate was 51% with a complete response of 46%. Of 16 complete responses, relapse occurred in four, none isolated to the central nervous system. Opportunistic infections occurred in 21% of those receiving treatment. Median duration of survival among all 42 patients is 5.6 months, 6.5 months in 35 patients evaluable for response, and 15 months in patients with complete response. Lower concentration of CD4 cells, history of prior AIDS, bone marrow involvement, and stage IV disease were independently associated with decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS.--Low-dose chemotherapy with central nervous system prophylaxis and zidovudine maintenance may be associated with durable remissions in AIDS-related lymphoma with fewer opportunistic infections than noted in prior reports. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and subdural hematoma after acute myocardial infarction and thrombolytic therapy in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II, pilot and clinical trial. In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II pilot and clinical trial, 908 patients [326 (35.9%) in the pilot study and 582 (64.0%) in the randomized study] were treated with 150 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen (rt-PA) activator in combination with heparin and aspirin, and 3,016 patients [64 (2.1%) in the pilot study and 2,952 (97.9%) in the randomized study] were treated with 100 mg rt-PA in combination with heparin and aspirin. Adverse neurological events occurred in 23 patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (2.5%) [nine cerebral infarctions (1.0%), 12 intracerebral hemorrhages (1.3%), and two subdural hematomas (0.2%)] and in 33 patients treated with 100 mg rt-PA (1.1%) [20 cerebral infarctions (0.7%), 11 intracerebral hemorrhages (0.4%), and two subdural hematomas (0.1%)]. The difference in adverse neurological events observed comparing the two rt-PA regimens was primarily due to a higher frequency of intracerebral bleeding among patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (1.3% versus 0.4%, p less than 0.01). Patients with recent (within 6 months) histories of stroke were not eligible for the study, and patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease were declared ineligible early in the study. The small number of patients (89, or 2.3%) with any history of neurological disease, intermittent cerebral ischemic attacks, or stroke who were enrolled before the stricter eligibility criteria were imposed or on the basis of incomplete baseline information experienced an increased frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage compared with patients without such histories (3.4% versus 0.5%). Mortality at 6 weeks after presentation among 23 patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage was 47.8%. Intracerebral hemorrhage is a severe but infrequent complication of rt-PA therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The combined frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral infarction after treatment with 100 mg rt-PA is comparable to that observed in other trials with thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction. 
Annular colon lipoma: a case report and review of the literature. Colonic lipomas are generally mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic pedunculated or sessile polyps, although they have been reported to cause intussusception or significant bleeding. The difficulty in differentiation is primarily with adenomatous polyps. We describe the unique case of a symptomatic annular colon lipoma simulating an annular colon carcinoma. 
An investigation into the etiology of irritable hip. A prospective review has been made of 111 children who presented with acute hip pain to determine it's etiology and assess the need for multiple investigations at presentation. There was no clinical hematological, serological or bacteriological evidence to identify positively patients with an irritable hip, neither was there good correlation with a history of infection. An effusion was diagnosed by ultrasound in 71% but there were no factors, either clinically or by investigation, to differentiate between patients with or without an effusion. We conclude that multiple investigations to find a source of infection in patients with irritable hip are not warranted as they are rarely positive, seldom affect management and are of no help in investigating the etiology of irritable hip. 
National surveillance of dialysis-associated diseases in the United States, 1989. To determine trends in a variety of dialysis-associated diseases and practices, the Centers for Disease Control surveyed 1,867 chronic hemodialysis centers in the United States in 1989 in conjunction with the annual facility survey performed by the Health Care Financing Administration. The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 92%. These 1,726 centers represented 122,734 patients and 32,486 staff members. The following results were found. 1) During the last 14 years, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection decreased from 3.0 to 0.1% among patients, and from 2.6 to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity declined from 7.8 to 1.4% among patients and from 0.9 to 0.3% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 92% of the centers. By the end of 1989, 19% of susceptible patients and 55% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1989, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) increased from 12 to 19% among patients and from 18 to 54% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1989 was reported to be 0.7% among patients and 0.1% among staff members. 2) Twenty-two percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia among their patients, and 51% reported septicemia. 3) The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 23%. 4) In 1989, 68% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers; these centers treated 73% of the dialysis patient population. Among centers that reused disposable dialyzers, the average number of reuses ranged from 1 to 50 (mean, 12) and the maximum number of times a disposable dialyzer was ever reused ranged from 3 to 150 (mean, 28). Chemical germicides used for reprocessing dialyzers included formaldehyde, Renalin (a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based germicide), and glutaraldehyde-based germicides. Reuse of disposable dialyzers was not associated with any increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. However, pyrogenic reactions occurring in clusters were reported more frequently in centers that reused conventional dialyzer membranes compared with centers that did not. This increased risk was associated only with centers that used Renalin or glutaraldehyde for reprocessing (not formaldehyde) and occurred with both automated and manual reprocessing systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Cutaneous lymphomas of phenotypically undetermined lineage: contribution of genotypic analysis. Genotypic analyses were performed in six primary cutaneous lymphomas whose lineage could not be assessed on the basis of histologic and phenotypic data. By immunophenotyping, these neoplasms expressed leukocyte common antigen and HLA-DR but did not show consistent immunostaining for B-cell or T-cell differentiation antigens. Expression of nonspecific histiocytic markers such as lysozyme and alpha 1-antitrypsin was found in three cases. By genotyping, three cases retained a germline configuration and immunoglobulin gene rearrangement was observed in one case, T-cell receptor gene rearrangement was found in one case, and both types of rearrangements in one case. Of the three patients in whom gene rearrangements were noted, two rapidly died and the other patient, with a dual genotype, is still alive 15 years after diagnosis. The three patients without gene rearrangements are alive and well after a mean follow-up of 2.5 years. It appears that cutaneous lymphomas with an uncertain phenotype include at least some cases of authentic B-cell or T-cell lymphomas. The germline configuration that we observed in cases with a chronic course remains difficult to explain. It may be related to a low malignancy form of histiocytic lymphoma, an atypical polyclonal hyperplasia, or even a low-grade lymphoma arising from a primitive cell without established commitment to either B- or T-cell lineage. 
Decreased oxyhemoglobin affinity in patients with sleep apnea syndrome. Oxyhemogloblin affinity (P50 at pH 7.4, PaCO2 = 40 mm Hg, temperature = 37 degrees C) and 2,3-DPG concentration were assessed in 15 nonsmokers (14 men and one woman 46 to 63 yr of age) with sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) and in 10 normal subjects (eight men and two women 22 to 48 yr of age). In patients with SAS, mean nocturnal apnea index was 46 +/- 20/h, and mean nocturnal SO2 was 86 +/- 6% versus 94.6 +/- 1.8% during the daytime. Daytime mean P50 of the patients was 28.5 +/- 1.2 mm Hg versus 27.1 +/- 0.3 mm Hg in the normal subjects (p less than 0.05). Daytime mean 2.3-DPG was 1.23 +/- 0.25 moles DPG/mole hemoglobin versus 0.80 +/- 0.15 (p less than 0.05). Significant correlations were found in patients between P50 and mean nocturnal SO2 (r = -0.62, p less than 0.01) and between P50 and 2,3-DPG (r = 0.68, p less than 0.01). The measurements were repeated in five patients after surgical or positive-pressure treatment. P50 and 2,3-DPG both decreased and returned to normal values. In conclusion, the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve is shifted to the right in patients with SAS and there is an increase in 2,3-DPG. These could be protective mechanisms against the development of polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, and cor pulmonale. 
Quantitative determination of acid-labile DNA in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Using a modified Feulgen hydrolysis procedure and integrating microdensitometry, the acid-labile nuclear DNA in exfoliated cervical epithelial cells was quantified in a range of histologically confirmed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), invasive cancer, and normal controls. The mean relative optical densities obtained for each sample group showed an increase from normal epithelium, through CIN grades, to invasive cancer. Although there was some overlap between groups, the difference in the overall mean values between the adjacent groups was statistically significant. The sensitivity of the test was 87.1% with a specificity of 99.2% and a predictive value of 99.5%, with no false negatives in the severe dysplasia and cancer groups. Quantitative data allows the threshold value to be altered to vary the sensitivity and specificity according to prevailing requirements. This suggests the possibility of using quantitative acid-labile DNA measurements to improve existing screening for cervical precancer. 
Selective spinal panangiography: use of a 4-F braided catheter with a soft-tip configuration. A 4-F braided catheter with a soft radiopaque tip was used in selective spinal panangiographic procedures. Results obtained with the catheter were compared with those obtained in procedures with conventional catheters. The catheter was used in the intercostal, lumbar, and sacral arteries. Advantages of using this catheter include excellent maneuverability, reduced patient exposure to contrast medium, and reduced fluoroscopy duration. 
Cerebrospinal fluid atrial natriuretic factor in intracranial disease. We tested the hypothesis that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is an indicator of brain injury in patients with intracranial disease. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was measured in 72 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 28 patients with intraventricular drains and in nine samples from outpatient controls undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture. Levels were correlated with diagnosis; systemic fluid administration; concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma; intracranial pressure; sodium, glucose, and protein concentrations, osmolality, and cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid; sodium concentration in the serum; and hemodynamics. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was highest in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with intracerebral hematoma, followed by those with obstructive hydrocephalus and subarachnoid hemorrhage (19 +/- 2, 13 +/- 3, and 8 +/- 2 pg/ml, respectively); atrial natriuretic factor concentration was less than 4 pg/ml in the controls. Patients treated with fluid restriction had significantly higher atrial natriuretic factor levels than those receiving maintenance or high-volume fluids (16 +/- 3, 8 +/- 2, 10 +/- 1 pg/ml, respectively). The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma was significantly elevated in patients with intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage (155 +/- 38 and 92 +/- 20 pg/ml, respectively) and did not correlate with fluid administration or the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid. Neither cerebrospinal fluid nor plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor correlated with intracranial pressure; cerebrospinal fluid sodium, glucose, or protein concentrations, osmolality, or cell count; serum sodium concentration; or hemodynamics. We conclude that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is a nonspecific indicator of brain injury. 
Axillosubclavian vein thrombosis: case report. Deep-vein thrombosis of the upper extremity, that is, axillosubclavian vein thrombosis, is a relatively rare and potentially overlooked diagnosis in the emergency department (ED). It can be the cause of significant morbidity and it may be life-threatening. Reported here is the case of a 23-year-old man who presented to the ED with left upper extremity pain and swelling. Venography confirmed the diagnosis of axillosubclavian vein thrombosis. Hospitalization and treatment with intravenous heparin led to a satisfactory recovery. The clinical presentation, predisposing factors, diagnosis, treatment, and complications of this rare entity are discussed. 
Quantitative sensory testing before and after regional guanethidine block in patients with neuralgia in the hand. Using reference values from healthy volunteers, thermal and vibration-induced pain thresholds and the sensibility for warm and cold were studied in 18 patients with neuralgia in one hand following a traumatic injury or surgery. All patients had spontaneous pain and allodynia to vibration. They were treated with intravenous regional guanethidine block (RGB). Quantitative sensory testing was performed on both hands before and 1-3 days after treatment. Eleven patients benefitted considerably from the block, with pain relief for 2 weeks or more. Ten of these 11 patients had mild nerve injuries caused by compressive trauma to the nerve. Before RGB they showed a moderate loss in temperature discrimination capacity; their heat pain thresholds were reduced and they exhibited allodynia to cold and vibration on the injured side. After RGB, the pain thresholds were normalised both to thermal and vibratory stimuli. These patients were classified as having sympathetically maintained pain (SMP). Seven patients reported no or only minor pain-relieving effect of RGB lasting 1-5 days. Severe nerve injuries were most frequent in this group of patients. On the injured side, before RGB, their ability to discriminate between warm and cold was markedly impaired, thermal pain thresholds were normal, and they showed allodynia to vibration. After RGB, there was no change in thermal pain thresholds and the allodynia to vibration persisted. These patients were classified as having sympathetically independent pain (SIP). The results indicate that quantitative thermal sensory tests, together with clinical evaluation of the nerve trauma, can help to predict which patients will have long-lasting pain alleviation after RGB treatment. 
Diagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct: usefulness of lymphangiography and CT. The usefulness of lymphangiography and CT in the diagnosis and localization of laceration of the thoracic duct was evaluated in 12 patients with chylothorax or chylous ascites after surgery. Bipedal lymphangiography was performed in all 12 patients. The last four patients studied also had CT after lymphangiography. Seven patients had abnormal findings on lymphangiograms; five with leaks from the thoracic duct, one with a lymphocele in a nephrectomy bed, and one with obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels after thoracotomy. Five patients had no evidence of lymphatic leakage. CT in one patient with evidence of a leak on lymphangiography showed extravasation of contrast medium into the mediastinum and pleural space. CT in three patients with no abnormalities on lymphangiography also showed no abnormalities. Four of the five thoracic duct lacerations and the lymphocele were confirmed surgically. The diagnosis of obstructed intestinal lymphatic vessels was supported clinically. Four of the five patients with normal findings on lymphangiograms had resolution of their pleural effusions and no evidence of recurrence during a follow-up period of 1-27 months. One patient with normal findings on lymphangiography had an alternative diagnosis established at surgery. Laceration of the thoracic duct was accurately diagnosed and localized with lymphangiography, which allowed definitive surgical repair. CT was of little additional value in diagnosing these injuries. 
A comparative trial of LC9018 plus doxorubicin and doxorubicin alone for the treatment of malignant pleural effusion secondary to lung cancer. The efficacy and safety of intrapleural LC9018 (Yakult Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) with or without doxorubicin (Adriamycin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) were evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial performed in 95 patients with malignant pleural effusions secondary to lung cancer. Seventy-six patients were eligible for the assessment of efficacy. The response rate for treatment with intrapleural doxorubicin plus LC9018 (38 patients) was 73.7%, which was significantly higher than the response rate of 39.5% for the control group treated with doxorubicin alone (38 patients) (P less than 0.01). The LC9018 group also showed a significantly greater improvement in performance status (PS) and symptoms (chest pain, chest discomfort, and anorexia) than the control group (P less than 0.05). A significant prolongation of survival was noticed in the LC9018 group (P less than 0.05). The main side effects of LC9018 were fever and transient hepatic dysfunction, but there were no serious adverse reactions. These results suggest that the intrapleural instillation of LC9018 can be recommended for the treatment of malignant pleural effusions. 
Impact of intensified therapy on clinical outcome in infants and children with neuroblastoma: the St Jude Children's Research Hospital experience, 1962 to 1988. To gauge the impact of intensified therapy on the survival of infants (younger than 1 year, n = 129) and children (greater than or equal to 1 year of age, n = 275) with neuroblastoma, we analyzed the results of eight successive clinical trials comparing various combinations of antineoplastic drugs, surgery, and radiotherapy. Changes in treatment did not affect the survival of children with involved noncontiguous lymph nodes or distant metastatic disease until the combination of cisplatin and teniposide (CDDP/VM26) was added to a basic regimen of cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin (CTX/DOX). The resulting 4-year survival was 28% +/- 5% (SE) compared with 7% +/- 2% for previous treatments (P less than .001 by the log-rank test). The 4-year survival of infants with metastatic disease was improved by administering CTX/DOX to all patients, reserving CDDP/VM26 for those whose disease was resistant to the former combination: 82% +/- 6% versus 45% +/- 8% in earlier studies; P less than .001. In the subset of infants whose tumors had disseminated to bone or bone marrow at diagnosis, this therapeutic approach increased the probability of long-term survival from 48% +/- 10% to 85% +/- 9% (P = .01). The small group of children over 1 year of age with localized unresectable tumors also fared significantly better with the switch to CTX/DOX chemotherapy (4-year survival, 93% +/- 7% v 42% +/- 13%; P = .02). Multivariate analysis indicated that young age, limited-disease stage, nonadrenal primary site, and intensified treatment were independent predictors of a more favorable outcome. We conclude that substantial advances in the treatment of neuroblastoma have occurred over the past 25 years at this institution. The current overall 4-year survival probability of 57% +/- 4% compares favorably with estimates for most other common solid tumors of childhood. 
Mycotic aneurysms of the carotid arteries--case report and review of the literature. Mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries are rare. We report a new case with a mycotic aneurysm of the carotid bifurcation associated with acute bacterial endocarditis of the aortic valve. A concomitant treatment of both lesions was performed. Twenty-six cases of mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries have been reported in the literature. We present a review of all these cases. 
Endoprosthetic replacement for stage IIB osteosarcoma. Over an eight-year period, 100 patients with IIB osteosarcoma have been managed. Eighty-one were treated with limb-salvage procedures, 78 of which involved reconstruction utilizing endoprostheses. Only 19 patients received amputation as the primary treatment for local control. Since 1984, all patients received preoperative and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. Those patients who received chemotherapy had a statistically significant improvement in five-year survival over those who did not (57% and 32%, respectively, p = 0.014). The functional results were good overall, with excellent results seen in distal femoral reconstruction. Twenty-eight of the 78 patients treated with endoprosthetic reconstruction experienced 30 complications (36%). Mechanical failure was the most common complication (10%) but was generally correctable. The local recurrence rate was 5% and the infection rate was 3%. Local complications were manageable. A statistical analysis revealed that the relative risk of patient death was 2.5 times higher than prosthesis failure for the 78 patients with endoprosthetic reconstruction. The intermediate-term results, with a median follow-up period of 43 months, remains encouraging. 
Regional myocardial function after repetitive brief episodes of ischemia: effect of altering the duration of the reperfusion period. How recovery of regional contractile function in myocardium is influenced by alterations in the duration of reperfusion after repetitive brief coronary artery occlusions was investigated in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs. All animals underwent five 5 minute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusions with a final 5-hour reperfusion period. Dogs were randomly assigned to one of three groups determined by the duration of reperfusion (5, 10, or 15 minutes) between successive 5-minute occlusion periods. A shortening of the duration of the reperfusion period between occlusions led to reduced recovery and progressive deterioration in systolic shortening after multiple occlusion-reperfusion sequences. With 15-minute reperfusion periods, the percentage of segment shortening (%SS) during the first through fourth reperfusion periods ranged from 17.1 +/- 2.6% to 18.2 +/- 1.8% and did not differ from the preocclusion control value (18.8 +/- 1.7%) by the end of the final reperfusion period. In contrast, in those dogs with 5-minute reperfusion periods, %SS was significantly reduced from the preocclusion control value (20.2 +/- 2.2%) at the completion of the final 5-hour reperfusion period (11.4 +/- 1.5%). Results of the present study indicate that after only a few brief periods of coronary artery occlusion, rapid and cumulative deterioration in regional contractile function can occur when the duration of intermittent reperfusion is sufficiently brief. 
Distribution of dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (E2) in the liver and portal lymph nodes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis: an immunohistochemical study. The reason for the close association between primary biliary cirrhosis and the appearance of antibodies that recognize the E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex is not understood. The distribution of the three pyruvate dehydrogenase complex subunits was examined in the liver and lymph nodes of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, patients with other liver diseases and normal subjects by immunohistochemistry using affinity-purified antibodies. Intensity of staining was assessed semiquantitatively and validated by scanning laser confocal microscopy. In primary biliary cirrhosis tissue, the E2 staining pattern did not parallel the reported distribution of mitochondria. E2 staining in biliary epithelial cells was consistently stronger than in hepatocytes. In primary biliary cirrhotic liver, staining of biliary epithelium was significantly stronger than in normal or other liver disease controls; many bile ducts in primary biliary cirrhotic liver demonstrated very high intensity, diffuse distribution of stain. No differences in staining intensity were seen between perivenular hepatocytes in primary biliary cirrhotic liver and those in controls; periportal hepatocytes in primary biliary cirrhotic liver were, however, more intensely stained than perivenular cells. In primary biliary cirrhotic portal lymph nodes, a subset of macrophages showed high-intensity, diffuse distribution of stain. By contrast, staining with antibodies to E1 and E3 (other components of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) produced uniform-intensity, mitochondrial distribution both in primary biliary cirrhosis and control tissue. The increased intensity of E2 in primary biliary cirrhotic tissue could be explained in terms of abnormal metabolism of E2 by biliary epithelial cells. 
Cardiovascular collapse following orthoclone OKT3 administration: a case report. Orthoclone OKT3 has been described to have significant adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, including pulmonary edema, angina, dysrhythmias, hypertension, and hypotension, usually following the first or second doses of the drug. We describe a case of cardiopulmonary arrest in a patient 1 minute after the initial injection of OKT3. Two subsequent doses were successfully administered with the guidance of hemodynamic monitoring, which showed profound, immediate effects of OKT3 on the cardiovascular system. Potential mechanisms of these effects are discussed. 
Long-term follow-up of children with testicular tumours: surgical issues. Testicular tumours are rare in childhood. The clinical, pathological and follow-up details of 48 children are presented. The combined approach of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy is confirmed as being extremely effective. Transcrotal orchiectomy is not an appropriate surgical procedure. Testicular biopsy is detrimental to prognosis. 
Impaired heart rate variability in patients with chronic Chagas' disease. Spectral analysis of heart rate variability was used to investigate the possible alteration in sympathovagal control of heart rate in patients with Chagas' disease. The study included 31 subjects, divided into three groups: controls, Chagas' 1 (subjects with only positive serology for Chagas' disease) and Chagas' 2 (subjects with positive serology and electrocardiographic abnormalities that are usually found in this disease). The subjects were studied during rest, while standing, and during handgrip exercise. With this approach, the low frequency (approximately 0.1 Hz) spectral component of R-R interval variability is considered to be a marker primarily of sympathetic activity, whereas the high frequency (approximately 0.25 Hz) component, which is related to respiration, seems mainly to reflect vagal activity. We observed significant (p less than 0.05) differences among the three groups during standing: although in the control subjects the low-frequency component increased (delta = 30 +/- 5 normalized units, nu), there was no increase in Chagas' 1 (delta = -1 +/- 8 nu) and Chagas' 2 (delta = -2 +/- 8 nu) patients. During handgrip exercise, another test that is capable of exciting sympathetic outflow, there was an increase of low frequency only in control subjects. These results confirm the occurrence of quantitative and assessable abnormalities in the neural control of heart rate variability in Argentinian patients with chronic Chagas' disease, even in the absence of heart failure. 
Clinical outcome and health care costs in renal revascularization--percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty versus reconstructive surgery. Clinical outcome and health care costs related to investigation, treatment with either percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) or reconstructive surgery, and follow-up of patients with renovascular hypertension with or without uraemia were analysed in 21 PTRA-treated and 16 operated patients. Most renal artery stenoses were atherosclerotic. Nineteen PTRAs were successful or partly successful and two failed; the patients were operated on without delay. All surgical reconstructions were successful. In the PTRA group six restenoses occurred after 4-24 months. Four were treated with re-PTRA and two were operated on. No recurrence occurred in the operated group. At the end of follow-up (median 48, range 9-84 months) primary patency in the PTRA group was 69 per cent and in the operated group 100 per cent. Secondary patency in the PTRA group was 100 per cent. With regard to hypertension, including primary and secondary results, 19 out of 21 (90 per cent) patients were improved in the PTRA group and 13 out of 16 (81 per cent) in the operated group. The diagnostic and preprocedure costs were the same in both groups, whereas the procedure and postprocedure costs were lower in the PTRA group. However, the follow-up costs were considerably higher because of recurrences and their treatment in the PTRA group. The total median cost of reconstructive surgery was 12 per cent higher than for PTRA, a non-significant difference. 
Kinetics of T cell activation in acute and chronic forms of murine graft-versus-host disease. Induction of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in the parent-into-F1 model is dependent on the presence of T cells in the donor inoculum. Although in vivo activation of donor T cells in response to F1 alloantigens is thought to be critical to GVHD induction, direct evidence of activated donor T cells has been lacking in this model. In the present study, spleen cells from acute or chronic GVHD mice were studied for evidence of T cell activation at multiple intervals early after GVHD induction. Spleen cells from both acute and chronic GVHD mice exhibited striking elevations in spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production, which were maximal 24 to 48 h after GVHD induction. Persistent lower levels of spontaneous in vitro activity were observed for spleen cells from mice tested 7 to 9 days after GVHD induction. In both forms of GVHD, increased spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production were dependent on the presence of donor CD4+ T cells. These results strongly support the presence of activated donor T cells in vivo. Furthermore, these data imply that despite the significant differences in outcome, acute and chronic GVHD share a common early event. 
Cerebrovascular disease in hypertensive blacks. There is convincing evidence that all grades of persistent diastolic hypertension, especially in blacks, should be treated in order to prevent stroke and other cardiovascular complications. Studies are now in progress to gather additional information concerning isolated systolic hypertension, especially in the aged. Inasmuch as at least one half or more of stroke deaths in blacks develop as the result of hypertension, lowering blood pressure offers the perfect opportunity to reduce considerably the frequency of this devastating illness. The recent dramatic fall in U.S. stroke mortality, greatest in the black female, is a commendable achievement, but the flattening of the declining mortality curve over the past several years should be a cause for alarm and intensive investigation. 
Mycobacterium fortuitum presenting as an asymptomatic enlarging pulmonary nodule. A case of Mycobacterium fortuitum presenting as an asymptomatic enlarging pulmonary nodule is described. This case is unusual because the patient was female, did not have underlying pulmonary disease, was not immunocompromised, had no evidence of dissemination, and had no history of aspiration or diabetes mellitus. The patient underwent thoractomy for resection of the pulmonary nodule, which led to the diagnosis. She recovered fully and is doing well without chemotherapy. 
Inverted papillomas and associated squamous cell carcinomas. Inverted papillomas of the nose and paranasal sinuses are found to be associated with squamous cell carcinomas in a small percentage of cases. The records of forty-six patients treated for inverted papillomas in these areas over a 10-year period were reviewed. Eleven patients (24%) were found to have squamous cell carcinoma, and one carcinoma in situ, in relationship to the inverted papillomas. This is a much higher percentage than generally reported. Four of these patients were found to have inverted papillomas coincidentally in surgical specimens resected for squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma were found to be in older age groups, were more likely to manifest epistaxis than the more common unilateral nasal obstructive symptoms, and had less time between the onset of symptoms and presentation than those with inverted papillomas alone. The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of inverted papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas in association with inverted papillomas are discussed. 
Computed tomographic scan confirmation of paraprosthetic enteric fistula. Aortoenteric anastomotic fistulae and paraprosthetic graft infections are rare but devastating complications following aortic graft surgery. Although the incidence of these complications is reported to be less than 2%, the difficulty in diagnosis and management has led to high mortality rates and extensive morbidity. The majority of patients present with either groin infection or significant gastrointestinal tract bleeding. There is, however, a subset of patients with nonspecific clinical findings in whom routine studies are not diagnostic. Computed tomography was a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of retroperitoneal infection in these patients by demonstrating small collections of periaortic gas or "black dots." The presence of periaortic gas in each instance proved to be a specific sign of a paraprosthetic-enteric fistula, as opposed to a graft infection without intestinal communication. 
Influence of hepatitis B virus infection and age on mode of growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. According to the extent of hepatic involvement of the tumor and that of portal vein invasion at the time of initial diagnosis, patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were grouped into three or four groups. Correlations among the extent of hepatic involvement, extent of portal vein invasion, and prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and age distribution were examined. The extent of hepatic involvement of the tumor and that of portal vein invasion were significantly greater in patients with positive HBsAg compared with findings in the negative patients (P less than 0.001). For cases of both positive and negative HBsAg, patients with a more extensive HCC were significantly younger. Results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that hepatitis B antigenemia and younger age were statistically significant and independent positive predictors of extensive HCC. These results strongly suggest that hepatitis B surface antigenemia and age play an important role in the growth mode and the kinetics of HCC in Japanese patients. 
Hydroureteronephrosis secondary to perforated Meckel's diverticulum. Complications related to Meckel's diverticulum are not unusual. However, involvement of the urinary tract is extremely rare. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of ureteral obstruction due to perforation of Meckel's diverticulum. 
Neutropenia-wise and pound-foolish: safe and effective chemotherapy in massively obese patients. The massively obese patients had an increased risk of cancer and complications from therapy. Chemotherapy in massively obese patients may be complicated by difficulty in calculating body surface area. No guidelines exist for calculating doses by either actual or ideal weight, and the calculated doses may vary by as much as 25%. The pharmacokinetics of antineoplastic drugs in obese patients are poorly understood and are not sufficient to create standards for rational dosing. We propose that patients being treated with curative intent receive full-dose intensity, using body surface area calculated on actual body weight or on ideal body weight with dose escalations if tolerated. Patients who are treated for short-term palliation may be more safely given doses based on ideal body weight. 
Reperitonealization of the lesser curve in proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer. Ninety-six consecutive patients were operated upon with proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer at our department during the two year period 1976 to 1978. These patients were prospectively randomized into two groups, one of which (45 patients) had reperitonealization of the lesser curve. These two groups are compared herein. Reperitonealization of the lesser curve was without benefit on long term clinical results, ulcer recurrence rate and gastric acid secretion. None of the patients had perforation of the lesser curve. 
Endoscopic ultrasound in pancreatic tumor diagnosis. In a prospective study from 1988 to 1990, 132 patients with suspected pancreatic tumor were examined with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), transabdominal ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and ERCP. The final diagnosis of 102 pancreatic tumors of different origin (76 malignant and 26 inflammatory tumors) and the exclusion of a pancreatic tumor in 30 patients was made by operation (N = 47), puncture (N = 36), autopsy (N = 3), or follow-up of a mean of 51 weeks (N = 46). Sensitivity and specificity in pancreatic tumor diagnosis were significantly higher for EUS (99% and 100%) than for US (67%/40%) and CT (77%/53%) and equal to ERCP (sensitivity 90%). This was even more obvious in small pancreatic tumors of 3 cm and less. However, as with the other imaging procedures, EUS was not able to differentiate reliably malignant from inflammatory pancreatic masses (accuracy 76% for malignancy and 46% for focal inflammation). From analysis of the endosonographic pattern of pancreatic tumors, no consistent morphologic features were identified which could have been specifically attributed to malignant or inflammatory masses. Our results show that EUS is superior to US and CT and equal to ERCP in pancreatic tumor diagnosis. In contrast to the indirect evidence obtained by ERCP, EUS provides direct visualization of tumor size and shape in almost all patients examined. Thus, EUS should be considered early in the evaluation of patients with suspected pancreatic tumors. 
Serum lactate dehydrogenase-3 isoenzyme in chronic granulocytic leukemia. Abnormal levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase-3 (LD-3) activity were observed in 92% of patients (35 of 38) with active chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL), in 40% of patients (4 of 10) in partial remission, and in 13% of patients (1 of 8) in complete remission. In evaluating the electrophoretic LD isoenzyme patterns of these patients, three criteria were used. In criterion-1 elevations, the LD-3/total LD ratio, expressed as a fraction of serum total LD, and LD-3 value, expressed in absolute units, were greater than the upper limit of the reference range. In criterion-2 elevations, only the LD-3/total LD ratio was greater than the upper limit of the reference range. In criterion-3 elevations, only the absolute LD-3 activity exceeded the upper limit of the reference range, and these specimens showed isomorphic elevation of all five LD isoenzymes. Use of the last of these criteria increased the clinical sensitivity of serum LD-3 elevations in active CGL from 82% to 92%. The mean serum LD-3 absolute value and serum total LD activity usually showed statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) among patients with active CGL, those in partial remission, and those in complete remission, but did not distinguish between subgroups of individuals with active CGL. Elevation of the serum LD-5/total LD ratio in 16 of 58 patients was due to hepatic injury or methodologic imprecision, showing analytically insignificant, borderline abnormalities in all cases of active CGL. In 10 of 62 patients in complete remission or partial remission, however, such elevation was unexplained. Our results indicate that the evaluation of serum LD-3 values in both absolute and relative terms slightly increases the clinical sensitivity of LD-3, and, therefore, suggest that LD-3 might be a useful marker for CGL. 
Rapid orocecal transit in chronically active persons with high energy intake. Although chronic physical activity by humans can raise energy requirements and energy intake severalfold above sedentary levels, whether these increases alter digestive strategy remains unknown. To investigate this possibility, food passage rate (mouth-to-large intestinal lactulose transit) and absorption (xylose) were compared in a cross section of young men chosen to represent a wide range of daily physical activity and food intake. In 20 men (energy intake 1,272-5,342 kcal/day), resting mouth-to-cecum transit was faster in high caloric consumers (r = -0.69, P less than 0.01). In contrast, xylose absorption (n = 26; measured either as urinary xylose excretion or integrated breath H2 production from the sugar) was unrelated to food intake. Dietary fiber intake was uncorrelated with energy intake. This apparent human digestive strategy of rapid transit across the gut absorptive surface, without a sacrifice in absorption, parallels the adaptations made by several animal species similarly faced with increased energy demand at constant fiber intake. We therefore conclude that the hyperphagia of chronic exercise in humans may be linked with significant gastrointestinal adaptations. 
Local eradication of rat colon cancer with photodynamic therapy: correlation of distribution of photosensitiser with biological effects in normal and tumour tissue. Photodynamic therapy is a photochemical technique for the local destruction of tumours, entailing the interaction of light with an administered photosensitiser to produce a cytotoxic effect. We investigated the tissue distribution of the photosensitiser aluminium sulphonated phthalocyanine (AlSPc) in dimethylhydrazine induced colonic tumours and adjacent normal colon in rats. Forty eight hours after intravenous injection, most tumours contained twice as much AlSPc as normal colon. Tumour size and position in the colon did not affect AlSPc concentration. Microscopic fluorescence localisation of AlSPc showed significant photosensitiser accumulation in tumour stroma, whereas tumour and normal mucosa contained similar amounts. Thus, some normal tissue damage, where malignant cells invade normal areas, would inevitably accompany eradication of tumours. Tumour destruction and healing of colon after tumour eradication were examined histologically. There was sharp demarcation between necrotic areas (tumour or normal) and adjacent tissue and, whether the treated area was tumour or normal, healing occurred by regeneration of normal tissue. Some incompletely eradicated large tumours showed evidence of delayed bleeding. The possibility of selective uptake or preferential retention of the photosensitiser in tumours formed the initial basis for investigation of photodynamic therapy, but it is now clear that this is seldom the most important factor for tumour eradication. Of far greater importance is the nature of the biological effect of photodynamic therapy as necrosis of small tumours involving the full thickness of the bowel wall can be achieved with safe healing by regeneration of normal colon. The maximum depth of necrosis produced was only a few millimetres, so this technique is unlikely to be of value as the primary treatment for large colonic tumours but may prove of value for eradicating small lesions or as adjunctive therapy for eradication of small nests of tumour remaining or recurring in the tumour bed after conventional surgery. 
Unruptured intracranial aneurysms: seizures and antiepileptic drug treatment following surgery. Twenty-one patients operated on for unruptured intracranial aneurysms were studied retrospectively in order to identify the incidence of postoperative seizures, factors predictive of seizures, and the response to discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs. The overall risk of postoperative seizures in initially seizure-free patients was 15.7%. Although seizures were not uncommon, antiepileptic drugs were successfully tapered in most of the patients before 12 months. 
Correlation of the amnestic effects of nicotinic antagonists with inhibition of regional brain acetylcholine synthesis in rats. Acetylcholine (ACh) is considered to play a primary role in normal mnemonic functioning. Although most research has centered on the central muscarinic cholinergic system, of recent interest in normal and pathologic cognitive processing is the role of the nicotinic cholinergic system. The purpose of this research was to further characterize the role of the nicotinic system in learning and memory processing in a classical passive avoidance task by rats. The centrally acting nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine produced a dose-dependent impairment of performance in the passive avoidance task, however, the peripherally acting nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium was ineffective in this test. To elucidate the potential neurochemical mechanisms underlying mecamylamine's amnestic effect, we examined the ability of the drug to alter specific dynamic components of rat brain cholinergic systems in five brain regions. Mecamylamine produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the synthesis of [3H]ACh from pulse-injected [3H]choline in all regions examined, but was without effect on endogenous, steady-state levels of ACh. As with the behavioral study, administration of hexamethonium was without effect on [3H]ACh synthesis. Calculation of the turnover rates of ACh allowed a correlation between the inhibition of the behavioral task and the inhibition of central cholinergic function. The high degree of correlation obtained (as well as earlier studies in nonhuman primates) underlined the possibility that presynaptically located nicotinic receptors on brain cholinergic neurons are tonically active and mediate a positive feedback mechanism for controlling cholinergic neuronal activity. These receptors may be the neurochemical substrate which underlie the behavioral changes after administration of nicotinic agonists and antagonists. 
Cervical bruits: clinical correlates of stenosis. To analyze the relationship among characteristics of buits, degree of underlying stenosis, and neurologic symptom complexes, the authors studied 157 patients with bruits undergoing digital subtraction angiography. Symptom status assignment (definite lateralizing, possible lateralizing, vertebrobasilar, diffuse, and asymptomatic) and cervical auscultation for location, duration, and other bruit characteristics were performed independently. Bruit occurrence was associated with stenosis of greater than or equal to 50% of the underlying vessel with the association being no stronger at higher levels of stenosis (greater than or equal to 80%). No relationship existed between the side of bruit and side of symptoms in those with lateralized symptoms. The authors found more severe degrees of carotid stenosis in two symptomatic groups (vertebrobasilar insufficiency [VBI] and definite lateralized) compared with asymptomatic patients. Those with VBI had more high-grade stenosis, whereas those with lateralized symptoms had more occlusions, which tended to be ipsilateral to the symptoms. 
Presynaptic regulation of cardiac sympathetic function in hypoxic guinea pigs. In the normal heart, presynaptic cholinergic muscarinic and alpha 2-adrenergic mechanisms modify the fractional rate constant for norepinephrine (NE) synthesis (kNE), an index of sympathetic neural function. To evaluate presynaptic regulation of kNE, conscious guinea pigs subjected to normoxia and then hypoxia (n = 7-8 in each group) were pretreated with 1) vehicle; 2) a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, methyl atropine; 3) an alpha 2-antagonist, yohimbine; or 4) a combination of the two. An increase of kNE was determined from incorporation of radiolabeled tyrosine into NE in a control period (arterial PO2 130 +/- 1.7 Torr, PCO2 36 +/- 0.5 Torr) and during a hypoxic state (PO2 49.6 +/- 1.0 Torr, PCO2 36 +/- 0.5 Torr). Hypoxia activated kNE in the atrioventricular node and right ventricular moderator band in vehicle-treated animals (P less than 0.05). Sympathetic activation was more general, however, because alpha 2-presynaptic influence acted to limit kNE in all tissues tested (P less than 0.05) except muscle, spleen, and posterior left ventricle. Cholinergic muscarinic presynaptic restraint on kNE was detected during hypoxia only in the left atrial appendage and lung (P less than 0.05). These data indicate that hypoxia increases kNE in the heart, but restraint by cholinergic muscarinic and alpha 2-adrenergic presynaptic mechanisms limits increases in neurotransmitter synthesis and noradrenergic activation regionally. 
Lingual thyroid: the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging. Lingual thyroid is an uncommon developmental aberration of embryogenesis. It may present as a mid-line, non-tender, painless, reddish appearing swelling in the throat. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a relatively new diagnostic method for this condition. Two cases of lingual thyroid are reviewed with their MRI's and surgical results. 
Local application of somatostatin in the rat ventrolateral brain medulla induces apnea. Local injections of the tetradecapeptide somatostatin (SOM) into the brain stem region were performed in anesthetized and decerebrate rats. SOM administration (0.6-1.8 nmol) into the nucleus paragigantocellularis and the nucleus reticularis lateralis of the ventrolateral medulla oblongata induced ventilatory depression and apnea. The occurrence of apnea was dose dependent and attributed to the anesthetic depth, and it was seen within 60-240 s after injection. In anesthetized rats the apnea was seen as a termination or a continuous decrease in tidal volume while respiratory frequency remained unaltered. SOM-induced apnea was caused by depression of central inspiratory drive. SOM injections into the dorsal medulla were ineffective in eliciting apnea, although a ventilatory depression but no apnea was induced in the awake unanesthetized state. In addition to its effect on basal ventilation, SOM administration in the ventrolateral medulla resulted in a blunted ventilatory response to hypoxic and hypercapnic stimuli in anesthetized rats. We conclude that SOM has potent inhibitory effects on respiration that are specifically located in the nucleus paragigantocellularis and the nucleus reticularis lateralis. 
Wrist movements in able-bodied and brain injured individuals. The purpose of this study was to compare movement velocity characteristics during targeted wrist movements between able-bodied individuals and a sample of individuals with spasticity secondary to closed head injury. Two amplitudes (30 degrees and 60 degrees) of movement were performed at slow and fast velocities, with the forearm either passively supported or actively supported by elbow extension and shoulder flexion. Variables measured were the following: (1) average velocity of entire movement, (2) velocity for 10 degrees increments of a movement, and (3) ratio of average peak 10 degrees increment velocity to average velocity. In addition, qualitative examination of velocity profiles was performed. Slow movements were performed in a discontinuous manner by both groups; however, observable differences in peak/average velocity were noted between groups in the unsupported position during slow and fast movements. Able-bodied individuals performed seven of eight fast movements with greater velocity (p less than .05) than brain injured individuals, and the fast movements of the able-bodied subjects were continuous. 
Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: current management of resectable and locally advanced disease. Surgical resection alone for patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas has rarely resulted in cure, and long-term survival is uncommon. The magnitude of the operation has historically prevented many patients from receiving multimodality therapy with systemic chemotherapy or radiation (external beam and intraoperative). Improved rates of operative morbidity and mortality, technical advances in intraoperative radiotherapy, and encouraging results from studies combining radiation and chemotherapy have renewed interest in innovative treatments for this disease. We review the rationale for the current management of patients with resectable and locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and the current trial at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. 
Hypertonic nasogastric tube feedings: do they cause diarrhea? Hypertonic NG tube feeding in hospitalized patients, whether on the hospital ward or in the ICU, is considered a common etiology of diarrhea. To evaluate the accuracy of this assumption, five normal volunteers, ten hospitalized postoperative patients with head and neck cancer, and 24 ICU patients were given hypertonic (690 mosm), low residue, lactose-free tube feedings starting at 30 kcal/kg.day. There was no prior history of diarrhea in any of the groups studied. There was a significant difference in albumin levels between the three groups, with an average albumin of 2.8 g/dl in the ICU patient group; different from 4.5 g/dl present in both the normal volunteer and non-ICU hospitalized patient groups (general linear models procedure from SAS, p less than .05) (Duncan test). Diarrhea was not present in the normal volunteers or non-ICU patients during the feedings, but did occur in 3/24 ICU patients. This difference was not significant. The three patients with diarrhea had an average albumin level of 3.0 g/dl, while the other ICU patients had an average albumin of 2.7 g/dl. We conclude that hypertonic NG tube feedings do not cause diarrhea in normal volunteers or postoperative head and neck cancer patients. However, in a small statistically insignificant percent of mechanically ventilated ICU patients, this regimen may cause diarrhea although no risk factors can be identified. 
Acute necrotizing pancreatitis: management by planned, staged pancreatic necrosectomy/debridement and delayed primary wound closure over drains. We reviewed our recent experience with management of 23 consecutive patients with acute necrotizing pancreatitis. All patients had documented necrotizing pancreatitis with parenchymal or peripancreatic necrosis. Our method of treatment has evolved from our previous approach of controlled open lesser sac drainage (marsupialization) to staged necrosectomy/debridement with delayed primary closure over drains. With this latter approach, hospital mortality was 4 of 23 patients (17 per cent), but significant morbidity still occurred in 12 of 23 patients (52 per cent). However, recurrent intra-abdominal abscess before discharge occurred in only one patient. We believe that this operative approach toward the severely ill patient with acute necrotizing pancreatitis who requires operative intervention will minimize the occurrence of intra-abdominal sepsis. 
Primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the iris. We describe herein a 4-year-old girl with primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the right iris. Malignant cells were aspirated from the aqueous humor, and the eye was enucleated 7 months after the tumor appeared. To our knowledge, only two cases of primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the iris have been reported. Both of these patients received radiation therapy prior to enucleation. 
Dietary effects on breast-cancer risk in Singapore. It is suspected that diet influences the risk of getting breast cancer. A study of diet and breast cancer was done among 200 Singapore Chinese women with histologically confirmed disease and 420 matched controls. A quantitative food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess intakes of selected nutrients and foods 1 year before interview. Daily intakes were computed and risk analysed after adjustment for concomitant risk factors. In premenopausal women, high intakes of animal proteins and red meat were associated with increased risk. Decreased risk was associated with high intakes of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), beta-carotene, soya proteins, total soya products, a high PUFA to saturated fatty acid ratio, and a high proportion of soya to total protein. In multiple analysis, the variables which were significant after adjustment for each other were red meat (p less than 0.001) as a predisposing factor, and PUFA (p = 0.02), beta-carotene (p = 0.003), and soya protein (p = 0.02) as protective factors. The analysis of dietary variables in postmenopausal women gave uniformly non-significant results. Our finding that soya products may protect against breast cancer in younger women is of interest since these foods are rich in phyto-oestrogens. 
Comparison of indium-111 antimyosin antibody and technetium-99m pyrophosphate localization in reperfused and nonreperfused myocardial infarction Recent imaging studies suggest that technetium-99m (Tc-99m) pyrophosphate yields a considerably larger estimate of myocardial infarct size than does indium-111 (In-111) monoclonal antimyosin antibody. To determine whether Tc-99m pyrophosphate may be taken up by reversibly injured myocytes, particularly in the setting of coronary reperfusion, the tissue localization of Tc-99m pyrophosphate and antimyosin antibody was compared in 11 dogs 24 to 68 h after anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (4 dogs with permanent occlusion, 7 with reperfusion). Technetium-99m pyrophosphate and In-111 antimyosin antibody content was determined in serial 2 to 3 mm wide endocardial and epicardial samples taken through the infarct zone in multiple short-axis left ventricular slices. The number of samples with increased In-111 antimyosin antibody (defined as greater than or equal to mean + 2 SD of normal) was not significantly different from that with increased Tc-99m pyrophosphate. This was true in both reperfused and nonreperfused infarcts. However, the intensity of uptake of Tc-99m pyrophosphate exceeded that of In-111 antimyosin antibody, particularly in the border zones of reperfused infarcts, and the area with moderate to marked increase in tracer uptake (greater than or equal to 2 times normal) was significantly larger with Tc-99m pyrophosphate than In-111 antimyosin antibody (p less than 0.001). A specific zone of abnormal Tc-99m pyrophosphate with normal In-111 antimyosin antibody content could not be identified. Histologic evidence of myocardial necrosis was found in virtually every sample with increased In-111 antimyosin antibody, Tc-99m pyrophosphate, or both. 
Comparison of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone in acute myocardial infarction. Urochinasi per via Sistemica nell'Infarto Miocardico (USIM) Collaborative Group. In a randomized trial of the effects on in-hospital mortality of intravenous urokinase plus heparin versus heparin alone, 2,531 patients with acute myocardial infarction in 89 coronary care units were enrolled for greater than 30 months. Patients admitted within 4 hours of the onset of pain were randomized to receive either intravenous urokinase (a bolus dose of 1 million U repeated after 60 minutes) plus heparin (a bolus dose of 10,000 U followed by 1,000 IU/hour for 48 hours) or heparin alone (infused at the same rate). Complete data were obtained in 2,201 patients (1,128 taking urokinase and 1,073 taking heparin). At 16 days, overall hospital mortality was 8% in the urokinase and 8.3% in the heparin group (p = not significant). Among patients with anterior infarction, mortality was 10.3% in the urokinase and 13.9% in the heparin group (p = 0.09; relative risk = 0.73). The incidence of major bleeding (urokinase 0.44%, heparin 0.37%) as well as the overall incidence of stroke (urokinase 0.35%, heparin 0.20%) was similar in the 2 groups. The rates of major in-hospital cardiac complications (reinfarction, postinfarction angina) were also similar. 
Effects of antiplatelet agents alone or in combinations on platelet aggregation and on liver metastases from a human pancreatic adenocarcinoma in the nude mouse. There is ample evidence to suggest that hematogenous metastasis may be related to the ability of tumor cells to promote aggregation of host platelets. Arachidonic acid metabolism in platelets and vessel walls may also contribute to the metastatic process. Several preliminary trials of platelet inhibitory agents have been performed. Ketoconazole (inhibitor of lipoxygenase and thromboxane synthetase), verapamil (calcium antagonist), forskolin (stimulator of platelet adenylate cyclase), and indomethacin (inhibitor of cyclooxygenase) were examined, alone and in combination, to investigate their effects on platelet aggregation and on hepatic metastases from human pancreatic tumor cells (RWP-2) in nude mice. The tumor cells were injected intrasplenically, and the animals were divided into control, single-drug and combination treatment groups. The agents were administered intraperitoneally 1 hr before and every 24 hr after the tumor cell injections for 6 days. Statistically significant differences were observed between the control and single-treatment groups on the reduction of liver tumor nodules (range P less than 0.001-0.032) and in the liver surface areas occupied by tumor (range P less than 0.001-0.013). Furthermore, when these agents were combined, similar reductions in liver tumor nodules were noted (range P less than 0.001-0.008), while even greater inhibitory effects were seen in the liver surface areas occupied by tumor (P less than 0.001) compared with the single-treatment groups. Also, the combination studies strongly inhibited RWP-2-induced platelet aggregation in human platelet-rich plasma. 
Natural history of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis associated with aortic disease. The natural history of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis has not been well defined, particularly when discovered in conjunction with aortic disease requiring correction. To better define the natural history of such lesions, 194 sequential aortograms in 48 patients were studied to define predictive criteria for stenoses at risk for progression. Sixty-six unsuspected atherosclerotic renal arterial stenoses were identified on the initial aortograms. Disease progressed in 42 arteries (53%), 14 bilateral and 28 unilateral. Seven arteries developed occlusion. All had stenoses averaging 80% (range 61% to 94%) noted on the most recent aortogram preceding occlusion. Risk factors including smoking, diabetes mellitus, elevated serum lipids, coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, or change in blood pressure or creatinine, did not correlate with degree or rate of progression of the renal artery stenosis. A difference in kidney size, although varying inversely with degree of stenosis, was not a statistically significant marker of disease progression. This analysis suggests that identification of renal arterial stenoses that will progress is best determined by sequential aortography. Highly stenotic vessels are more prone to occlude than those less stenotic. Consequently, individuals with preocclusive lesions should benefit from prophylactic renal revascularization during aortic reconstruction. 
Long-term results of keratoepithelioplasty in Mooren's ulcer. A consecutive series of 20 eyes with Mooren's ulcer was treated by a new surgical approach: keratoepithelioplasty alone or in combination with corneoscleral lamellar graft. Eighteen (90%) eyes showed complete remission promptly after surgery; the other two also healed with the administration of additional systemic and topical steroids. During the follow-up periods (mean, 3.1 years), minor recurrence was found in 5 (25%) eyes for the first 6 months, in none (0%) for the second 6 months, in 2 (12%) for the third 6 months, and none thereafter. All seven eyes with recurrence were cured by additional steroid treatment, alone or with conjunctival excision and/or keratoepithelioplasty. In the 18 (90%) eyes, the lenticules, constantly observed, remained silent on the scleras, which were free from conjunctival invasion. These results strongly support the authors' theory that keratoepithelioplasty using donor corneal lenticules can heal Mooren's ulcer via blockage of infiltrated conjunctival invasion. 
Surgical manipulation of primate cerebral arteries in established vasospasm. It is generally believed that surgery in the face of angiographic vasospasm is dangerous due to an increased incidence of postoperative cerebral ischemia. One theory is that arterial narrowing is exacerbated by surgical manipulation of vasospastic vessels during aneurysm dissection and clipping. This theory was tested in a primate model of cerebral vasospasm and the results reported. Six monkeys underwent baseline cerebral angiography, followed by induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on both sides of the circle of Willis. An equal amount of fresh autologous blood clot was placed around each internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral artery. Six days later, angiography was repeated and the right craniectomy was reopened for clot evacuation and surgical manipulation of the right cerebral arteries, including placement of a temporary aneurysm clip on the right middle cerebral artery. The left cerebral arteries were not exposed or manipulated, and served as controls. Twenty-four hours later angiography was repeated, then the animals were killed. Equal and significant vasospasm (greater than 40% reduction in vessel caliber compared to baseline, p less than 0.05) was seen in the middle cerebral arteries on both sides of the circle of Willis in all animals 6 and 7 days after SAH. There was no significant change in the severity of vasospasm on Day 7 compared with Day 6 in the right cerebral arteries. Increased risk of postoperative cerebral ischemia for surgery in the peak vasospasm period may be due to mechanisms other than increased arterial narrowing precipitated by surgical manipulation. 
Recurrent spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrhage from peliosis hepatis. Peliosis hepatis is a rare and highly lethal liver lesion in which numerous blood-filled cavities or cystic spaces are dispersed throughout the hepatic parenchyma. The cause is unknown, although the condition is associated with several disease states and medications. Patients may present with hemorrhage, liver failure, the hepatorenal syndrome, cholestasis, or portal hypertension. We treated a patient who survived two separate hemorrhages from peliosis hepatis. The surgical intervention used, hepatic dearterialization, has allowed this patient to remain asymptomatic for 5 years. 
The influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection on the development of the hepatitis B virus carrier state. To assess the influence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection on the natural history of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, a study was undertaken of the clinical records of all 77 homosexual men with documented seroconversion to anti-hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) between visits to either of two Sydney clinics between 1985 and 1989. HIV-1-seropositive subjects developed chronic HBV infection (positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] greater than 6 months) more frequently (7/31, 23%) than HIV-1-seronegative ones (2/46, 4%; P = .026). HIV-positive subjects who cleared HBsAg had significantly more circulating CD4+ lymphocytes (mean, 547 x 10(6)/l) than those who did not (352 x 10(6)/l, P less than .005). A subset of subjects who acquired both viruses between visits had an even higher rate of chronic infection (4/10, 40%). Icteric illnesses were reported more frequently by HIV-1-seronegative (11/46, 24%) than -seropositive subjects (3/31, 10%; P = .20). These findings indicate a potential for an increased reservoir of HBV infection in the community as a consequence of the HIV-1 epidemic. 
Detection of intracoronary fibrin degradation after coronary balloon angioplasty. Intracoronary thrombus formation may be involved in the pathogenesis of arterial closure after coronary angioplasty and may contribute to restenosis. It is hypothesized that, unlike markers of platelet activation and fibrin formation, D-dimer, a product of plasmin-mediated proteolysis of cross-linked fibrin, is not subject to significant catheter-induced artifact and could be used to study intracoronary fibrin degradation during angioplasty. No significant difference in D-dimer levels was noted in serial plasma samples obtained from an 8Fr arterial sheath and the wire lumen of an angioplasty balloon catheter, indicating that sampling through the catheter lumen did not induce artifactual D-dimer elevations. Translesion (proximal and distal to the lesion) coronary blood samples were collected in 31 patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty pretreated with aspirin, dipyridamole and heparin. In 20 of those in whom translesion coronary samples for plasma D-dimer levels (mean +/- standard deviation) were collected before balloon dilation, there was no evidence of ongoing intracoronary fibrinolysis (proximal D-dimer levels, 289 +/- 145 ng/ml; distal, 299 +/- 156 ng/ml; difference not significant). After coronary angioplasty (n = 31), there was a relatively small, but significant (p less than 0.001) increase (45 +/- 71 ng/ml) in translesional D-dimer levels (proximal, 396 +/- 223 ng/ml; distal, 441 +/- 257 ng/ml). The results from this study suggest (1) D-dimer levels are not subject to significant catheter-induced artifact and may be useful for assessment of intracoronary fibrin metabolism, and (2) intracoronary degradation of fibrin can be detected after (but not before) routine coronary angioplasty despite pretreatment with antithrombotic therapy, presumably in response to balloon-induced arterial injury and fibrin formation. 
Chronic urticaria and cancer: an epidemiological study of 1155 patients. To evaluate the possible association of malignant disease with chronic urticaria 1155 consecutive cases with chronic urticaria were reviewed. The Swedish Cancer Registry, Stockholm, was searched for records reporting malignancies in the study population (1958-84), and the expected number of malignancies was calculated on the basis of age- and sex-standardized incidence data. A malignancy was diagnosed in 36 patients with urticaria and the expected number of malignancies was 41. In 23 patients the malignancy appeared during the same year as the onset of urticaria or later. The expected number was 25.6. We conclude that chronic urticaria is not statistically associated with malignancy in general. 
The effects of dorsal column stimulation on measures of clinical and experimental pain in man. Despite the extensive use of dorsal column stimulation (DCS) for the control of various chronic pain conditions, most clinicians report only modest success rates. Surprisingly, there has been little placebo-controlled investigation of its efficacy for altering either clinical or experimental pain perception. The current study compared the effects of DCS to placebo stimulation on clinical pain perception, perceived intensity of painful heat stimuli and visual stimuli, and the discrimination of small changes in noxious heat intensity and in light intensity. We found that DCS, but not placebo stimulation, significantly altered ratings of spontaneous clinical pain as well as those of painful cutaneous heat. In addition, heat discrimination thresholds were increased by DCS, but not placebo. On the other hand, DCS had no effect on ratings of visual stimulus intensity nor on visual discrimination, suggesting that the DCS modulation of pain perception was not due to a general change in attention. These data indicate that DCS significantly alters pain transmission in humans. Nevertheless, the relatively small reduction in clinical pain (less than 30%) must be weighed against the invasive nature of electrode implantation. 
Molecular basis of sequestration in severe and uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria: differential adhesion of infected erythrocytes to CD36 and ICAM-1. The CD36 and ICAM-1 glycoproteins on vascular endothelial cells have been implicated as cytoadherence receptors for Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IRBC). Adhesion of IRBC from Thai patients with uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria to purified CD36 or ICAM-1 and to C32 melanoma cells was compared. All malaria isolates bound to solid phase-adsorbed CD36 and to fluid-phase 125I-labeled CD36. IRBC adhesion to purified ICAM-1 varied widely, and no correlation with clinical severity of disease was observed. The cytoadherent phenotype of IRBC was modulated by selective panning on plates coated with purified CD36 or ICAM-1. IRBC selected by panning on CD36+, ICAM-1+ melanoma cells bound to cells that express surface CD36 but not to CD36-deficient cells, indicating that CD36 exerts a strong selective pressure on the IRBC cytoadherent phenotype. IRBC adhesion to CD36 and ICAM-1 suggests that P. falciparum parasites may use these receptors in vivo to promote parasite survival and immune evasion. 
Cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum. A report of three cases. Three cases of peritoneal cystic mesothelioma are reported. All patients were women who had undergone previous abdominal surgery for unrelated conditions. Tumors consisted of solitary and multiple cystic masses involving the abdominal and pelvic peritoneum. The cysts focally infiltrated the muscularis externa of the small intestine in case 1, the outer muscular layer of the uterus in case 2, and the omental tissue in case 3. These findings give morphologic support to the borderline clinical behavior of this tumor that often recurs and support the hypothesis that previous surgery may play a role in its pathogenesis. 
Chronic diarrhea. A practical approach for the pediatrician. Despite the high prevalence of chronic diarrhea there is no universal approach to its diagnosis and treatment. This article summarizes the pathophysiologic processes that result in chronic diarrhea and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this often distressing problem. 
Cardiopulmonary arrest following an infusion of calcium 2-amino ethanol phosphate. The intravenous infusion of calcium 2-amino ethanol phosphate was coincidental with cardiopulmonary arrest in a 53-year-old woman with a history of multiple sclerosis. Resuscitation was followed by massive hemolysis, renal failure, adult respiratory distress syndrome, shock liver, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. This agent, in use by at least one practitioner in West Germany for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders is not FDA approved for use in the United States, nor is clinical investigation underway. It is currently thought to be in use by about 200 practitioners throughout this country as treatment for multiple sclerosis. It is apparently obtained in West Germany and brought illegally into the United States. This is the first known report of an adverse drug reaction associated with the use of this product. 
Determination of erythrocyte-bound acetylcholinesterase activity for monitoring pyridostigmine therapy in myasthenia gravis. Monitoring of pyridostigmine therapy in patients with myasthenia gravis is not routinely performed, since the daily pyridostigmine doses are adjusted to the patient's actual clinical status rather than to pyridostigmine plasma concentrations (PPC). Moreover, PPC determination is time-consuming and needs much technical equipment. Since pyridostigmine reversible blocks acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at the neuromuscular junction, we studied the correlation between the enzyme's blood activity (erythrocyte-bound AChE) and PPC, on the one hand, and between blood AChE activity and the clinical status of the individual patient, on the other. In five previously untreated patients with myasthenia gravis blood AChE activity decreased in accordance with the actual PPC after a single oral dose of 60 mg pyridostigmine (group A). Amelioration of the clinical status corresponded to the decrease of AChE activity in the same way. In another five patients, who were on stable pyridostigmine medication for at least 1 week, AChE activity and PPC were constant during the day (group B). Since it is easier to perform than PPC, our results suggest that the determination of AChE activity may be superior to measuring PPC for monitoring cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in selected cases. 
Striatopallidonigral degeneration in Pick's disease: a clinicopathological study of 41 cases. The frequency and degree of stiatopallidonigral (SPN) degeneration were examined in 41 autopsy cases of Pick's disease. Based on the degree of SPN degeneration, these cases were arranged into four groups: 1) group I (severely degenerate; 19.5%), 2) group II (moderately degenerate; 22.0%), 3) group III (mildly degenerate; 36.5%), and 4) group IV (non-degenerate; 22.0%). 17 of the 41 cases had a definite (moderate to severe) SPN degeneration. The striatum, especially the caudate nucleus, was most frequently and most severely affected, while the internal segment of the globus pallidus was least frequently and least severely affected. In general, the oral portions of the SPN nuclei were more severely involved. In addition, in the putamen and globus pallidus the dorsomedial portions adjacent to the internal capsule were apt to be affected more markedly than the other portions. In the substantia nigra the degeneration tended to be more predominant in the pars reticulata than in the pars compacta, although both were usually involved. In addition, the medial to central portions of the substantia nigra were more vulnerable. In comparing the severely and moderately degenerate groups (groups I and II) with the mildly and non degenerate groups (groups III and IV), the former had more female cases, longer duration of illness, and more third-stage cases. In addition, the former contained more cases with lower brain weight and (predominant) frontal atrophy type, and more atypical cases without Pick bodies, or with symmetrical pyramidal tract degeneration or with combined traumatic lesions. It is notable that in all cases with definite SPN degeneration no extrapyramidal involuntary movements had been detected. 
Seasonality of disease in Kuwait. To compare the seasonal variation in total mortality and deaths from cardiovascular, respiratory, and malignant disease, data were collected from North-East Scotland (Grampian region) and Kuwait. Seasonal differences were similar, in both timing and degree, for total mortality and deaths from circulatory disease, but were greater in Kuwait for respiratory disease. Peak mortality was during winter in both areas: in Grampian, when the climate is most uncomfortable, and in Kuwait, when the climate is at its most comfortable. Socioeconomic changes in Kuwait have been accompanied by a rapid fall in the degree of seasonality (deseasonality) for both total and infant mortality. These findings suggest that mortality peaks in winter, not because of a seasonally low temperature, but because of a seasonal fall in mean temperature irrespective of the annual mean temperature.
