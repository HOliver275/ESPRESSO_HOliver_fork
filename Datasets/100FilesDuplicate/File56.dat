Nutritional supplementation, psychosocial stimulation, and growth of stunted children: the Jamaican study. The benefits of nutritional supplementation, with or without psychosocial stimulation, on the growth of stunted children were evaluated. Children aged 9-24 mo with lengths less than -2 SD of the National Center for Health Statistics references (n = 129) were randomly assigned to four groups: control, nutritional supplementation, stimulation, and both interventions. A fifth group with lengths greater than -1 SD was also enrolled. Length, weight, head and arm circumferences, and triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses were measured on enrollment and 6 and 12 mo later. Multiple-regression analysis was used to determine the effects of the interventions in which age, sex, initial status, initial dietary intake, and several socioeconomic variables were controlled for. Stimulation had no effect on growth and there was no interaction between the interventions. After 12 mo supplemented children had significantly increased length, weight, and head circumference (all P less than 0.01). The effects of supplementation were not cumulative but occurred in the first 6 mo. 
Gastric carcinoma presenting as an exacerbation of ulcers during pregnancy. A case report. Gastric cancer is unusual during pregnancy. Also, because of the physiologic changes that occur with pregnancy, it is rare to see a worsening of peptic ulcers during pregnancy. A patient with an exacerbation of peptic ulcers presented with gastric carcinoma during pregnancy. 
Stress fractures in athletes. How to spot this underdiagnosed injury. Stress fractures are an increasingly common injury in competitive athletes, especially runners. Amenorrheic athletes are at particularly high risk. A radionuclide bone scan should be considered when the index of suspicion for stress fracture is high. Plain radiographs are of little use in establishing the diagnosis in the early stages of the injury. Early diagnosis and prompt institution of conservative therapy allow for a favorable outcome in most cases. Avoidance of or reduced participation in the inciting activity is important for pain control. Certain stress fractures, such as those involving the femoral neck, should be monitored closely and treated aggressively with internal fixation when conservative measures fail. Runners who have exercise-induced amenorrhea should be advised to decrease their training intensity to a level where menses resume. Cyclic therapy with conjugated estrogens and progesterone should also be considered, as should daily calcium supplementation. 
Mortality, neoplasia, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone in the United Kingdom OBJECTIVE--To determine the cause of death and incidence of neoplasia in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone. DESIGN--A long term cohort study established to receive details of death certification and tumour registrations through the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and NHS central register. PATIENTS--All patients (1246 male, 662 female) treated for short stature with pituitary growth hormone under the Medical Research Council working party and health services human growth hormone committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death or development of neoplasia. RESULTS--110 patients died (68 male, 42 female; aged 0.9-57 years) from 1972 to 1990. Fifty three death were from neoplasia responsible for growth hormone deficiency (27 craniopharyngioma, 24 other intracranial tumour, two leukaemia); two from histiocytosis X; and 13 from pituitary insufficiency. Six patients died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, six of other neurological disorders, and eight of acute infection. Other deaths were apparently unrelated to growth hormone deficiency or its treatment. Seventeen tumours (in 16 patients) were identified during or after growth hormone treatment. Four were in patients with previous intracranial neoplasia and two were after cranial irradiation. Thirteen were intracranial, the others being Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoma of colon, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS--Recurrence or progression of intracranial tumours and potentially avoidable metabolic consequences of hypopituitarism were the main causes of death. Growth hormone treatment probably did not contribute to new tumour development. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after pituitary growth hormone treatment continues to occur in the United Kingdom. This cohort must remain under long term review. 
Neutralizing antibodies to interferon-alpha: relative frequency in patients treated with different interferon preparations. The frequencies of antibody development so far reported in patients treated with different interferons (IFNs) are not readily comparable because of differences in treatment regimens and assay methods. Thus the frequency of neutralizing antibody development was analyzed in a large sample of sera derived from a relatively homogeneous group of patients treated with different IFN-alpha preparations. The frequency of developing neutralizing antibody to IFN varied according to the IFN given. Particularly, the seroconversion frequency was significantly higher in patients treated with recombinant IFN-alpha 2a (20.2%) than in patients treated with either recombinant IFN-alpha 2b (6.9%) or IFN-alpha N1 (1.2%), a lymphoblastoid IFN-alpha. Furthermore, sera obtained from patients treated with either recombinant IFN neutralized both types of recombinant IFNs but failed to neutralize IFN-alpha N1. 
Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in pleomorphic adenoma, chordoma, and astrocytoma. A comparison of three antibodies. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a major constituent of glial cytoplasmic intermediate filaments. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression has been accepted as a marker of astroglial differentiation or origin. However, GFAP expression has been demonstrated in a variety of normal and neoplastic tissues outside the central nervous system, including pleomorphic adenomas, chordomas, bone, and cartilage. It has been postulated that coexpression of GFAP and vimentin in neoplastic myoepithelial cells in pleomorphic adenomas reflects early chondroid differentiation. Glial fibrillary acidic protein expression in chondromyxoid and chordoid tumors was studied in formaldehyde solution-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 20 pleomorphic adenomas and 10 chordomas by the immunoperoxidase method with the use of commercially available monoclonal (n = 2) and polyclonal (n = 1) antibodies. All pleomorphic adenomas and chordomas demonstrated expression of GFAP with the use of the polyclonal antibody (Biomeda Corp [Foster City, Calif]). Variable expression of GFAP was present in 90% (18/20) and 70% (14/20) of pleomorphic adenomas, and in 20% (2/10) and 0% of chordomas, with the use of the two monoclonal preparations (Dakopatts [Glostrup, Denmark] and BioGenex Laboratories [San Ramon, Calif]), respectively. Normal brain tissue and eight astrocytomas were used as "controls" to compare staining intensity and quality between the polyclonal and monoclonal anti-GFAP antibodies. Glial fibrillary acidic protein positivity with the polyclonal antibody was more intense than that with either monoclonal antibody despite similar (congruent) distributions of tumor cell types that were stained in control brain and astrocytoma tissues. The GFAP polyclonal antibody was more frequently immunoreactive than the monoclonal antibodies, particularly in cells that exhibited chondroid differentiation. These findings may have practical application in surgical pathology. 
Use of endovascular stents in congenital heart disease. BACKGROUND. Balloon expandable intravascular stents have been used to support vessel walls in coronary and peripheral arteries in adults. The purpose of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of these stents in the treatment of congenital heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS. Forty-five stents were placed in 30 patients, who were 0.2-30.2 years old (weight, 3.5-76 kg). Patients with areas of stenosis that were difficult to approach surgically were chosen. Stents were mounted over balloons and placed by standard catheterization techniques. Twenty-three patients had branch pulmonary artery stenosis. Thirty-six stents were placed successfully and had reduced pressure gradients from 50.6 +/- 24 to 15.9 +/- 13.4 mm Hg. Five patients had stents placed after atrial surgery: three in obstructed Fontan repairs, one at the superior vena cava-right atrial junction after sinus venous defect repair, and one at the site of a Glenn shunt. Atrial stents reduced pressure gradients from 9.8 +/- 8.2 to 2.0 +/- 2.6 mm Hg. One patient had a stent placed in the descending aorta after coarctation dilation, and the pressure gradient was reduced from 50 to 25 mm Hg. One patient had pulmonary vein dilation with stent placement. Two stents migrated at the time of placement; one required surgical removal, and one was anchored in place by balloon dilation. One patient died within 24 hours of catheterization because of thrombus obstruction of the Fontan repair. Nine patients have undergone recatheterization. All stented vessels have remained at the same caliber as at original stent placement. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that balloon expandable stents are useful in selected postoperative stenoses in congenital heart disease. 
Intracerebral hemorrhage related to cerebral amyloid angiopathy and t-PA treatment. Tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) has been approved as thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction, but this agent can cause serious bleeding complications including intracerebral hemorrhages. Mechanisms underlying the development of these hemorrhages have not been clarified. We report a patient who developed two intracerebral hemorrhages shortly after receiving t-PA for the treatment of an acute myocardial infarction, and who was found to have cerebral amyloid angiopathy at autopsy. Staining of cortical sections with Congo red and an antibody directed against beta amyloid protein (A4 peptide) disclosed specific involvement of most of the subarachnoid and superficial cortical vessels in the region of the two hemorrhages. Based on the findings in this patient and in 6 additional patients reported recently, it is likely that cerebral amyloid angiopathy plays a pathogenic role in some intracerebral hemorrhages associated with the administration of t-PA. The cautious use of t-PA with heparin in patients who are elderly or demented may be advisable. 
Radical prostatectomy for stage A adenocarcinoma of the prostate: staging errors and their implications for treatment recommendations and disease outcome. Of 148 patients with clinical stage A1 (32) or A2 (116) disease who had radical prostatectomy only 63% and 62%, respectively, had pathological stage A disease. Although 25% of those with clinical stage A1 and 9% of those with clinical stage A2 disease had no cancer at radical prostatectomy, 12% and 29%, respectively, had pathological stage C disease or higher. Clinical Mayo grade 1 was never associated with extracapsular disease but 60% of those with grade 3 or higher tumor did have extracapsular disease. Over-all survival was comparable to the expected survival. Clinical stage A2 cancer was associated with a significantly higher progression rate (when prostate specific antigen values were considered, p = 0.0011) and cancer death rate (p less than 0.045) than stage A1 disease, whereas pathological stage was not significantly related to disease outcome, possibly because of the use of adjuvant treatment (hormonal or radiation) for some patients with pathological stage C or higher disease. The vagaries of clinical staging associated with stage A disease, as well as the previously documented progression on long-term followup (8 to 10 years) in younger (60 years old or less) patients with stage A1 prostate cancer make radical prostatectomy with its limited morbidity an acceptable treatment choice. 
Group B streptococcal endocarditis of tricuspid valve. We report three cases of group B streptococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve. Two patients were intravenous drug abusers. In the literature review, and including our cases, ten patients had group B streptococcal endocarditis of the tricuspid valve. Half of the patients were intravenous drug abusers. Four of the other patients had underlying conditions. All patients were treated with a penicillin with or without an aminoglycoside. Three patients underwent tricuspid valve surgery. The overall mortality was 20 percent. Both patients who died received medical therapy only. 
Coronary artery narrowing due to extrinsic compression by myocardial abscess. A case of aortic valve endocarditis complicated by perivalvular abscess extending into myocardium is presented. Echocardiography and aortography failed to detect the abscess, but coronary angiography revealed its presence by extrinsic compression of left anterior descending and diagonal arteries. Morphological features of this rare cause for coronary narrowing are described. 
Surgical treatment of concomitant urethral diverticulum and stress incontinence. Urinary incontinence is frequently associated with a urethral diverticulum in female patients. Preoperative evaluation including a thorough history and physical examination, voiding cystourethrogram, urethroscopy, and urodynamic studies can diagnose both the urethral diverticulum and any concomitant bladder-urethral dysfunction. Preoperative recognition of stress urinary incontinence or patients at risk for this problem postoperatively permits effective treatment with concomitant transvaginal bladder neck suspension and urethral diverticulectomy. 
Treatment of chronic infected hip arthroplasty wounds by radical debridement and obliteration with pedicled and free muscle flaps. Nine patients with extensive wounds of the hip joint due to chronic infection following total hip arthroplasty or internal fixation of fractures of the femoral head and neck have been treated by serial radical debridements to remove infected bone, contaminated remnants of bone cement, and the surrounding fibrotic soft tissues. The resultant deep cavity extending down to the acetabulum has then been obliterated with either pedicled muscle flaps or free muscle flaps. Subcutaneous or transpelvic transposition of rectus abdominis muscle flaps is preferred for smaller defects, but only the free latissimus dorsi muscle flap provides sufficient volume of tissue to obliterate the more extensive hip defects. Systemic antibiotics have been continued only for a short-term course of 14 days postoperatively. There has been no recurrence of infection, with follow-up ranging between 6 months and 3 1/4 years. One patient has undergone reimplantation of a second custom hip prosthesis into the vascularized bed of a free latissimus dorsi muscle flap. 
A modified technique for obliteration of large bony defects after cystectomy. Thirteen cysts treated by enucleation followed by collapsing an osteoperiosteal flap to eliminate dead space are presented. Four of the cysts were dentigerous and nine were radicular. The bony defects ranged in size from 3 to 7 cm in greatest dimension. Healing by primary intention occurred in all cases. This method has been found to be successful in the obliteration of large bony defects after cystectomy. 
A comparative trial of the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Outcome in 3- to 8-month-old infants, 9- to 23-month-old infants and children, and 24- to 30-month-old children. The reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids were compared in 139 infants aged 3 to 8 months, 60 infants and children aged 9 to 23 months, and 99 children aged 24 to 30 months. Good antibody responses to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and agglutinogens occurred in all age groups after both the third and fourth doses. After the fourth (booster) dose, the mean antibody values in initially seronegative infants vaccinated at 3 to 8 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 67.8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU) per milliliter; anti-FHA, 149.5 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 125.6. The values in initially seronegative children vaccinated at 24 to 30 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 92.9 EU/mL; anti-FHA, 251.7 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 275.8. Reactions following immunization were minimal. Except for drowsiness after the first dose in infants, there were no clinically significant differences in reactions between infants and older children. The findings in this study coupled with the recent demonstration of efficacy of this vaccine in 2-year-old children supports the recent Japanese recommendation to lower the age of immunization with acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids to 3 months. 
Hemifacial spasm in an infant due to fourth ventricular ganglioglioma. Case report. The case of an infant is reported in which hemifacial spasm due to a ganglioglioma of the fourth ventricle was relieved by surgery. Previously described causes of hemifacial spasm are summarized, and the relevance of this case to theories on the pathogenesis of the condition is discussed. 
The influence of severity of spinal cord ischemia in the etiology of delayed-onset paraplegia. To clarify the cause of delayed-onset paraplegia, the authors evaluated the neurologic outcome after temporary (10 to 30 minutes) spinal cord ischemia in the awake rabbit. Loss of motor function occurred in less than 2 minutes in all animals. Restoration of flow within 16 minutes always resulted in full return of function, whereas with occlusion times of greater than 27 minutes all animals remained paralyzed. After temporary occlusion of 20 to 21 minutes, however, 71% of animals returned to normal neurologic function but developed delayed-onset paraplegia 14 to 48 hours later. This appears to be a reliable method for the creation of a model of delayed-onset paraplegia in the awake animal, and will facilitate more detailed studies of the pathophysiology of ischemia-induced paraplegia. 
Long-term results after lateral cranial base surgery. The surgical management of patients with slow-growing benign temporal bone neoplasms has been criticized because of its significant morbidity and mortality compared with results after radiation therapy, but long-term control by irradiation remains unproved. Long-term surgical results have not been studied previously. One hundred twenty-nine skull base operations were performed in 126 patients at the Otology Group, Nashville, Tenn., from January 1970 through May 1987. Fifty-eight patients responded to questionnaires focusing on recovery from loss of cranial nerves. All patients regained some degree of facial function (class V or better), no alimentary tubes or tracheotomies were in use, and no patients had debilitating aspiration. Long-term compensation from the cranial nerve deficits of lateral skull base surgery can be expected in most patients and should not be used as an argument for irradiation in patients with a long life expectancy at time of diagnosis. 
Gastric mucosal pH as a prognostic index of mortality in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine if measurements of gastric intramucosal pH have prognostic implications regarding ICU mortality. DESIGN: Prospective comparison of outcome. SETTING: General adult ICUs in two teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Eighty consecutive patients age 18 to 84 yrs (mean 63.4), 50 men and 30 women, 55% in the medical and 45% in the surgical services. METHODS: Gastric intramucosal pH was measured on ICU admission and again 12 hrs later. A value of greater than or equal to 7.35 was used to differentiate between normal and low gastric intramucosal pH. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-four patients had a normal gastric intramucosal pH and 26 patients had a low gastric intramucosal pH on ICU admission. The mortality rate was greater in the low gastric intramucosal pH group (65.4% vs. 43.6%; p less than .04). The frequency of sepsis and the presence of multisystem organ failure also were greater in the low gastric intramucosal pH group (p less than .01). Further stratification of patients according to gastric intramucosal pH measured 12 hrs after admission showed a greater mortality rate in patients with persistently low gastric intramucosal pH when compared with patients with normal gastric intramucosal pH during the first 12 hrs (86.7% vs. 26.8%; p less than .001). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements of gastric intramucosal pH on ICU admission, and again 12 hrs later, have a high specificity for predicting patient survival in this ICU patient population (77.8% to 80.6%). Furthermore, given its relative noninvasive nature, tonometrically measured gastric intramucosal pH may be a useful addition to patient monitoring in the ICU. 
Allele loss at the retinoblastoma locus in human ovarian cancer. To gain a broad spectrum on allelic loss of specific loci in ovarian tumors, we initially examined DNA from 23 pairs of ovarian tumors and matched peripheral blood lymphocyte samples from the same patients, using 27 polymorphic DNA markers distributed on 13 chromosomes. Significant high frequency of allelic deletion (22%-44%) at chromosome 13 loci (D13S31, D13S32, D13S33, and D13S34) at bands q12-q34 was observed in tumor tissues. These results led us to investigate the loss of heterozygosity at the retinoblastoma (RB) locus in ovarian tumors, because the RB gene is a tumor-suppressor gene located at 13q14. Analysis of the variable number of tandem repeat sequence polymorphism in intron 20 in the RB gene revealed that 6 (30%) of 20 patients with informative samples showed allelic loss at the RB locus in their tumor tissues. This loss, of relatively high frequency, suggests that the RB gene, or a closely linked gene, seems to be involved in the development of ovarian cancer. 
Exertional sudden death in soldiers. To address the problem of a significant rise in the incidence of exertional sudden death worldwide, the medical records and necropsy reports of all deaths that occurred in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) during 1974-1986 were scrutinized. Twenty male soldiers, aged 18-29 yr, died suddenly and unexpectedly within 24 h of strenuous exercise. Necropsy results, available for 90% of the subjects, included underlying cardiac disease in 50% and noncardiac causes of death in 33.3%; the cause of death was unidentifiable in 16.7% of the subjects. Prodromal symptoms in 70% of the subjects are presented as a main focus of this investigation. The most frequently reported symptom was exertional or nonexertional syncope in 40% of the subjects. Chest pain, acute gastrointestinal symptoms, or febrile disease were reported in 30% of the cases. The findings of this research suggest that syncope is a major antecedent symptom of exertional sudden death. An attack of syncope in young conditioned individuals should be followed by thorough medical surveillance, and strenuous exercise should be avoided until this procedure is completed. Sports and military officials have the obligation to promote awareness that strenuous exercise should not be performed in the presence of acute gastrointestinal symptoms or febrile illness. 
Prevention of portal hypertension and portosystemic shunts by early chronic administration of clonidine in conscious portal vein-stenosed rats. The hemodynamic effects, including mesenteric-systemic shunts of early chronic administration of clonidine, were studied in conscious, unrestrained, portal vein-stenosed rats. In rats receiving early chronic clonidine (600 micrograms.kg-1.day-1 by gavage), begun 3 days before portal vein stenosis and then administered continuously for 10 consecutive days, portal pressure (10.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) and degree of mesenteric-systemic shunts (58% +/- 25%) were significantly lower than in the placebo group (15.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg and 83% +/- 7%, respectively). The effects were observed either 2 to 3 hr or 18 to 24 hr after the last dose of clonidine. In rats receiving clonidine continuously for 5 days, starting 5 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) was significantly lower than in the placebo group, but mesenteric-systemic shunts (82% +/- 8%) were not significantly different. In rats receiving a single oral dose of clonidine (600 micrograms/kg) 10 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg), measured 2 to 3 hr after clonidine administration, was significantly lower than in the placebo group. Mesenteric-systemic shunts (83% +/- 8%), however, were not significantly different from the placebo group. In addition, 18 to 24 hr after a single dose of clonidine, hemodynamic values returned to basal conditions. We also demonstrated that chronic clonidine administration begun before portal vein stenosis can reduce the initial increase in portal pressure after this procedure. We concluded that early chronic clonidine administration reduces the severity of portal hypertension and the development of portosystemic shunts in portal vein-stenosed rats. 
Cerebrospinal fluid atrial natriuretic factor in intracranial disease. We tested the hypothesis that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is an indicator of brain injury in patients with intracranial disease. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was measured in 72 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from 28 patients with intraventricular drains and in nine samples from outpatient controls undergoing diagnostic lumbar puncture. Levels were correlated with diagnosis; systemic fluid administration; concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma; intracranial pressure; sodium, glucose, and protein concentrations, osmolality, and cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid; sodium concentration in the serum; and hemodynamics. Atrial natriuretic factor concentration was highest in cerebrospinal fluid from patients with intracerebral hematoma, followed by those with obstructive hydrocephalus and subarachnoid hemorrhage (19 +/- 2, 13 +/- 3, and 8 +/- 2 pg/ml, respectively); atrial natriuretic factor concentration was less than 4 pg/ml in the controls. Patients treated with fluid restriction had significantly higher atrial natriuretic factor levels than those receiving maintenance or high-volume fluids (16 +/- 3, 8 +/- 2, 10 +/- 1 pg/ml, respectively). The concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the plasma was significantly elevated in patients with intracerebral hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage (155 +/- 38 and 92 +/- 20 pg/ml, respectively) and did not correlate with fluid administration or the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid. Neither cerebrospinal fluid nor plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor correlated with intracranial pressure; cerebrospinal fluid sodium, glucose, or protein concentrations, osmolality, or cell count; serum sodium concentration; or hemodynamics. We conclude that the concentration of atrial natriuretic factor in the cerebrospinal fluid is a nonspecific indicator of brain injury. 
Influence of exercise-induced myocardial ischemia on the pattern of left ventricular diastolic filling: a Doppler echocardiographic study Previous studies using Doppler echocardiography to evaluate left ventricular diastolic filling have shown that myocardial ischemia induced by coronary balloon angioplasty or atrial pacing results in a decrease in the left ventricular inflow peak early (E) to peak atrial (A) velocity ratio. To investigate the effects of exercise-induced ischemia on Doppler-derived filling variables, 20 patients with coronary artery disease and exercise-induced electrocardiographic changes and regional wall motion abnormalities determined by two-dimensional echocardiography were evaluated and compared with 20 patients without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. Doppler echocardiography was performed at rest and immediately after exercise before the resolution of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities. Peak E and A velocities increased from rest to postexercise in both the ischemic and nonischemic groups, although the ischemic group demonstrated a greater increase in peak E velocity (from 68 +/- 15 cm/s at rest to 88 +/- 22 cm/s after exercise) than the nonischemic group (70 +/- 13 to 77 +/- 18 cm/s) (p less than 0.05 for the difference in response between groups). Accompanying these changes was a slight increase in the peak E/A velocity ratio in the ischemic group (1.04 +/- 0.28 at rest to 1.13 +/- 0.42 after exercise) versus a decrease in the nonischemic group (1.07 +/- 0.30 to 0.90 +/- 0.28) (p less than 0.05 intergroup difference). 
Long-term consequences of CNS treatment for childhood cancer, Part I: Pathologic consequences and potential for oncogenesis. The pathologic changes associated with the treatment of cancer of the nervous system are reviewed. Computed tomographic, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomographic findings of these abnormalities are described, followed by discussion of the known histopathologic features. For the most part, pathologic effects are primary vascular and/or demyelinating. We review each of these effects at all levels of the neural axis. This review concludes with a discussion of the risk of developing second malignancies. Although this complication is infrequent, the likelihood that survivors of childhood cancer will develop a second malignancy is 10 times that of age-matched controls. This phenomenon in part relates to genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and host susceptibility. These qualifications not withstanding, most studies implicate central nervous system radiation with and without chemotherapy as the primary etiology for second malignancies. 
Lymphomatous presentation of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A subgroup at high risk of early treatment failure. Multivariate analyses of the clinical course of 1537 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) identified a subgroup which experienced short remission duration and a high incidence of extramedullary relapse. The patients differed from other ALL patients by the presence at diagnosis of two or more of a constellation of clinical and laboratory features: organomegaly or mass disease, E-rosette positivity, hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dl, leukocyte count greater than 50,000/microliters, male predominance, and older age. This type of presentation of ALL is referred to as the "lymphoma syndrome" (LS) since such patients exhibit a pattern of several clinical and laboratory features which were observed repeatedly but in differing combinations, and some of which clinically resemble lymphoma. A subsequent database from 2231 patients was analyzed. Patients with a mediastinal mass, massive splenomegaly, or massive adenopathy, alone or in combination, had a worse outcome when the patient also had either leukocytosis, E-rosette-positive lymphoblasts, or a normal or near normal hemoglobin (Hb) level at diagnosis. Similarly, the above three laboratory features alone or in combination did not predict less than 40% disease-free survival (DFS) unless they were accompanied by at least one of the clinical features of mass disease. When at least one clinical feature and at least one laboratory feature were present, the overall DFS was 36% 6 years after diagnosis versus 64% for all other patients. The association of these features with poor prognosis remained significant after adjusting for the level of leukocyte count at diagnosis, age at diagnosis, and sex of the patients. Patients with this recurrent syndrome of features do not represent a homogeneous biologic entity but they constitute a subgroup of patients with ALL having a high risk of treatment failure using current therapies, including failure to achieve remission, early relapse, and increased frequency of relapse in extramedullary sites. They deserve early recognition at diagnosis and selection of treatment strategies appropriate for very high risk ALL. 
Intraoperative use of a 2-mm choledochoscope for the exploration of small bile ducts and the pancreatic duct. Intraoperative visualization of the biliary and pancreatic ducts can be difficult in a nondilated system. Very small extra- and intrahepatic bile ducts occasionally require visualization but do not admit the traditional 6.5-mm intraoperative flexible choledochoscope. We have prospectively examined the use of a 2-mm choledochoscope for the intraoperative evaluation of the biliary and pancreatic ducts in 36 patients. In 27 patients, the choledochoscope was advanced through the cystic duct stump for examination of the common bile duct following cholangiography. The scope was successfully passed into the cystic duct stump and into the common bile duct in 76 per cent of patients. Inability to pass the scope through the cystic duct was usually due to acute angulation of the cystic duct/common duct junction. In an additional five patients, intraoperative cholangiography revealed a filling defect in a very small duct. A choledochotomy was made and the 2-mm choledochoscope was used to exclude the presence of stones in a small bile duct. In four patients the choledochoscope was used during a Puestow procedure to visualize and help extract stones in the tail and head of the gland. No complications occurred in these patients due to the use of the choledochoscope. We conclude that the 2-mm choledochoscope aids in internal visualization of small intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts and the pancreatic duct. It may be useful as an adjunct to cholangiography in determining the nature of filling defects. 
AAEM case report #21: hemifacial spasm: preoperative diagnosis and intraoperative management. A 75-year-old man developed progressive involuntary hemifacial spasm. Electrophysiologic evidence of abnormal cross-transmission between neurons of the facial nerve was demonstrated. Electrodiagnostic studies were used to confirm the diagnosis preoperatively and determine the adequacy of vascular decompression of the facial nerve intraoperatively. 
Generation and cloning of stable human IgE-secreting cells that have rearranged the C epsilon gene. Although the secretion of Ig isotypes other than IgM is generally accompanied by a DNA rearrangement that deletes C mu (and the other IgCH genes located between VDJ and the expressed CH gene), a system has recently been described that generates a high frequency of IgE-secreting cells that have failed to delete IgCH genes or to rearrange their C epsilon genes. These cells, derived from EBV-transformed human PBMC, secrete IgM and IgD as well as IgE. To determine whether the absence of C epsilon rearrangement and CH gene deletion is a general phenomenon for human IgE-secreting cells, we have characterized IgE-secreting cells that are generated by culturing purified human B cells with EBV plus IL-4 in the presence of irradiated human PBMC. In contrast to the earlier observation, we have not been able to detect any cells that demonstrate cytoplasmic staining for IgE and concurrently stain for a second Ig isotype. Stable IgE-secreting cell lines and clones produced by this method have rearranged one of their C epsilon genes and have deleted both C mu genes. These observations demonstrate that the generation of human IgE-secreting cells can involve the same gene rearrangement and deletional mechanisms that lead to the generation of cells that secrete other isotypes. 
Lower-extremity vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease: prospective evaluation with duplex Doppler sonography. Eighty-five men with 92 vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity underwent a total of 264 examinations with duplex Doppler over a 2.5-year period. In 64 patients who underwent more than one examination, the total follow-up encompassed 740 months. In 220 native femoral arteries (96.0%) the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was higher than that in the graft. Arteriovenous shunting was associated with a normal PSV and a markedly elevated diastolic component at spectral analysis. Focal fluid collections were common initially near the graft and usually disappeared uneventfully. An average PSV of 32 cm/sec or less was always associated with impending occlusion. The sensitivity of an average PSV of 40 cm/sec or less to indicate impending graft occlusion by the next visit was only 33%; the specificity, 94%. At initial examination, stenoses were associated with high PSV focally in the graft or low PSV with absent diastolic flow. 
The role of family structure, functioning, and pain modeling in headache. In an initial attempt to examine relationships between family functioning and chronic headache disorders, the present study examined: a) family structure characteristics, b) family functioning, and c) family pain modeling. Subjects completed an assessment battery consisting of several measures of family functioning. Analyses showed that migraine sufferers (N = 42) as compared to headache-free controls (N = 59) were more likely to describe their families as emphasizing clear organization, structure, rules, and overall control, but less likely to encourage emotional expression. No differences were found between tension headache subjects (N = 43) and headache-free controls. While only an initial exploration of the importance of family characteristics in chronic headache, these results suggest that there are important differences in headache subjects' (particularly migraine) reports of family environment and functioning. 
Community cancer programs as strategic alliances: challenges and guidelines for action. This paper assesses the utility of strategic alliances as a way of expanding and improving the quality of cancer care provided in communities with limited access to major treatment centres. Alliances provide an organizational model for future community-based cancer programs by accommodating a growing need for interdependence among organizations and providers while permitting substantial independence and autonomy. Five managerial challenges to ensuring effective and efficient delivery of cancer services are identified: to secure mutually reinforcing exchanges between and within all levels of cancer care, to develop protocols and programs relevant to the unique characteristics of patients and providers, to provide treatment and cancer control services, to involve interdisciplinary teams of providers at all levels of care and to achieve quality assurance, improvement and evaluation. In addition, the paper includes a set of guidelines to facilitate the implementation of community cancer programs as strategic alliances: reaffirm the role of community oncologists, primary care physicians and nurses as partners in the program; define the structure and culture necessary for commitment rather than simply compliance; redefine the role of management; establish data-monitoring systems; modify reward systems; and set realistic time frames and expectations. 
Abdominal CT findings after liver transplantation in 66 patients. CT scanning is used frequently to assess the condition of patients after liver transplantation. The CT records of 174 adult patients who underwent liver transplantation were studied retrospectively to determine the number and timing of CT studies as well as the frequency and significance of the findings. One-hundred seventy CT scans were obtained in 66 (38%) of the 174 patients, with a mean of 2.6 scans/patient. The interval between transplantation and scanning was 1 day to 24 months; in 59 (89%) of 66 patients, the first CT scan was obtained within 30 days. The acute indications for CT scanning were fever or leukocytosis in 54 (92%) of 59 patients and abnormal liver function tests in five (8%) of 59 patients. CT scans obtained more than 30 days after transplantation were repeat scans in all but seven patients. Indications in this latter group were the same as for the acute group, plus evaluation of hepatic neoplasia in three patients. CT findings included periportal low attenuation in 41 (62%) of 66 patients; ascites in 25 (38%); splenomegaly in 19 (29%); loculated intraperitoneal noninfected fluid collections in 13 (20%); intrahepatic, splenic, pancreatic, or perihepatic abscesses in seven (11%); hepatic infarction in six (9%); splenic infarction in three (4%); and hepatic calcification in two (3%). Other major abnormalities included inferior vena caval thrombosis (one patient), pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery with rupture (one patient), and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (one patient). CT scanning after liver transplantation is used predominantly in the acute setting to evaluate for liver infarction or intraabdominal abscess. In this setting, CT showed these abnormalities, in addition to tumor recurrence or vascular abnormalities, in 15 (23%) of 66 patients. 
Comparison of allografts and prosthetic valves when used for emergency aortic valve replacement for active infective endocarditis. Aortic valve replacement (AVR) using allografts is an established method of treating aortic valve disease. It is uncertain, however, whether the increased technical demands of allograft AVR can be justified in emergency operations. This study reports 15 patients treated between 1987 and 1990 for acute bacterial or fungal endocarditis involving the aortic valve. Patients underwent emergency AVR because of severe congestive failure, overwhelming sepsis or cerebral emboli. Eight patients received prosthetic valves (group I: 4 mechanical, 4 porcine) and 7 received human allografts (group II: 5 aortic and 2 pulmonary). The groups were comparable in age (group I, 55 years; group II, 51 years), intravenous drug abuse (group I, 1; group II, 3), and previous AVR (group I, 3; group II, 2). One group I and 4 group II patients had septal abscesses. Additional procedures in group I included mitral valve replacement (2), tricuspid valve replacement (1) and aortic root replacement (1). Additional procedures in group II were mitral valve repair (1), root replacement (1), atrial septal defect closure (1) and aortocoronary bypass (1). Mean bypass times (group I, 189 minutes; group II, 204 minutes) and cross-clamp times (group I; 108 minutes; group II, 121 minutes) were similar. Operative deaths occurred in 4 of 8 group I and 1 of 7 group II patients. All surviving patients have been successfully followed (group I, 28 months; group II, 18 months). No group I patient has required reoperation. One group II patients required reoperation for recurrent infection affecting the allograft, and another group II patient died 10 months postoperatively from noncardiac causes. 
Hearing aid prescribing: is the specialist opinion necessary? A restructuring of the service for provision of hearing aids has been proposed by the Royal National Institute for the Deaf. This is based on the assumption that very few patients referred for hearing aids have significant ear disease and it is not necessary for them to see an ENT specialist. The case notes of 200 consecutive patients referred to the Hearing Aid clinic were reviewed. In only half of these would a hearing aid have been prescribed without a specialist opinion. The remainder either did not need a hearing aid or required further investigation and surgical or medical treatment. In addition there was significant evidence of lack of expertise amongst General Practitioners in recognizing ear disorders. It is imperative that any patient requiring a hearing aid be seen by someone experienced in otology rather than be dealt with by the General Practitioner alone. 
Flow cytometric determination of the multidrug resistant phenotype in transitional cell cancer of the bladder: implications and applications. We detail our experience with a monoclonal antibody to detect the cell surface P-glycoprotein product of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1) in the human bladder. A total of 32 patients had 44 different specimens analyzed. The samples consisted of 8 normal bladders, 21 transitional cell carcinomas, 1 mucinous adenocarcinoma, 3 P-0 bladder wall specimens and 10 nonmalignant urothelial samples from cystectomies. P-glycoprotein was not detected in the normal adult or pediatric bladder. Bladder specimens from 3 children with a neurogenic bladder revealed enhanced expression (21%, 14% and 4% positivity). Transitional cell carcinoma usually demonstrates low expression at diagnosis (less than 6%), although 3 patients had enhanced initial expression (11%, 12% and 31%). Three patients treated with chemotherapy demonstrated 56%, 76% and 50% expression of MDR-1. Nonmalignant tissue from cystectomy specimens had low expression of MDR-1. The specificity of this system was confirmed with human bladder cell lines. The ability of flow cytometry to detect and quantify the expression of MDR-1 may allow for the early detection of chemotherapy resistance in patients with transitional cell carcinoma treated with systemic and intravesical therapy. 
Administration of sucralfate prolongs survival of animals with experimental peptic ulceration. Ligation of the pig bile duct (BDL) results in 100% incidence of pars esophageal ulceration within 48 hours of the procedure. Usually such ulceration is uniformly fatal unless a highly selective vagotomy is performed simultaneously with the BDL. The administration of sucralfate to pigs with BDL prolonged their survival for up to 7 days, with evidence of healing of the ulcer on macroscopic and histologic observations. An increase in cell proliferation in the squamous epithelium of the ulcerated area was also seen in this sucralfate group. These features were not seen in controls, pigs with BDL only, or pigs with BDL and with magaldrate (Riopone), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (DeNol), or carbenoxolone. Analysis by Sepharose 2B gel filtration showed that there was no significant difference in the amounts of polymeric mucin in any group, with a wide scatter of the data seen especially for pigs in the untreated BDL-only group. This study suggests that sucralfate may enhance healing in this experimental pig ulcer model via a mechanism independent of the stimulation of mucus secretion. We propose that coating the mucosa with sucralfate provides a temporary substitute barrier that creates a microenvironment conducive to wound repair by mucosal proliferation. 
Impact of variability among surgeons on postoperative morbidity and mortality and ultimate survival. OBJECTIVE--To assess the differences among surgeons in postoperative complications, postoperative mortality, and survival in patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. DESIGN--Prospective study of patients with colorectal cancer managed by one of 13 consultant surgeons, none of whom had a special interest in colorectal surgery. SETTING--Royal Infirmary, Glasgow. PATIENTS--645 sequential patients with colorectal cancer presenting over the six years from 1974 to 1979. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Postoperative complications, postoperative mortality (within 30 days), and survival (up to 10 years); predictive factors for postoperative mortality and survival; and relative hazard rate ratios for individual surgeons. RESULTS--The proportion of patients undergoing apparently curative resection varied among surgeons from 40% to 76%; overall postoperative mortality varied from 8% to 30%. After curative resection postoperative mortality varied from 0% to 20%, local recurrence from 0% to 21%, and the rate of anastomotic leak from 0% to 25%. Survival at 10 years in patients who underwent curative resection varied from 20% to 63%, two year survival in those who underwent palliative resection varied from 7% to 32%, and median survival in those who underwent palliative diversion varied from one to eight months. The hazard rate ratios among individual surgeons, taking into account the identified risk factors, varied from 0.56 to 2.03, from 0.17 to 1.92, and from 0.57 to 1.50 for curative resection, palliative resection, and palliative diversion, respectively. CONCLUSION--There were significant variations in patient outcome among surgeons after surgery for colorectal cancer; such differences compromise survival. A considerable improvement in overall survival might be achieved if such surgery were undertaken by surgeons with a special interest in colorectal surgery or surgical oncology. 
Coronary occlusion following diagnostic angiography: salvage by intracoronary stenting. Catheter-induced coronary artery dissection and occlusion is a rare but serious complication of diagnostic cardiac angiography. This report describes the successful management of this complication with an intracoronary stent after prolonged balloon inflations and intracoronary thrombolytic therapy were unsuccessful. 
Trace elements and plasmapheresis. The relationship between serum aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) and plasmapheresis (PP) treatment was examined. Three patients with rheumatoid arthritis, six with myasthenia gravis, and 6 with multiple sclerosis were studied. Serum Al, Zn, Cu, and Fe were measured before and after PP. Plasma was separated by first filtration; a second filtration separated the plasma components. Three liters of plasma were treated in each PP session. With each PP treatment, total protein (TP) removed was 20 +/- 5% and serum albumin removed was +/- 6%. Serum Al rose significantly (p less than 0.01 from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 2.8 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl post-PP. Serum Zn, Cu, and Fe decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) from 86.2 +/- 7.4 micrograms/dl, 126 +/- 18 micrograms/dl, and 108 +/- 14 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 58.4 +/- 10.2 micrograms/dl, 104 +/- 6 micrograms/dl, and 82 +/- 16 micrograms/dl post-PP, respectively. Two days after the end of the six-month PP treatment, serum Al levels rose significantly (p less than 0.01), from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl to 3.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl. However, serum TP, serum albumin, and serum Zn, Cu, and Fe did not change significantly. It thus appears essential in PP treated patients, to remove Al from the blood to protect against aluminum intoxication. 
Analysis of the transition to percutaneous placement of Greenfield filters. To establish whether a transition from surgical to percutaneous placement of Greenfield filters was justified, a review of the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of the two approaches was conducted. Between 1984 and 1989, 168 filters were placed in 169 patients, 48 surgically and 120 percutaneously. Placement was successful in 45 (94%) of the 48 surgical patients and 120 (99%) of the 121 percutaneous patients. Filter misplacement occurred in three (6%) surgical patients and no percutaneous patients. Clinically evident femoral vein thrombosis occurred in only four (5%) of the percutaneous patients, while inferior vena cava thrombosis occurred in three (3%) of the percutaneous patients. One pulmonary embolus occurred after percutaneous filter placement and resulted in death. The cost of percutaneous placement was 58% that of surgical placement. A retrospective review of the experience in our patient population indicates that safety, cost, and ease of insertion make the percutaneous approach the procedure of choice for Greenfield filter placement. 
Chronic myeloid leukemia in a woman with Still's disease treated with 198Au synoviorthesis. A 32-year-old woman presented with chronic myeloid leukemia 20 years after 2 198Au synoviortheses to her knees for severe juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. She progressed to blast phase of her disease and died from complications of therapy. The literature on rheumatoid arthritis, its therapy, radioisotopes and leukemia is reviewed. 
K-edge digital subtraction arthrography of the painful hip prosthesis: a feasibility study. K-edge energy subtraction radiography is a method for detecting the presence of iodinated contrast material by subtracting two digital radiographs produced by X-ray beams with energies above and below the iodine K edge. We performed a feasibility study on the application of K-edge energy digital subtraction arthrography (KEDSA) to painful hip prostheses. During arthrography, loosening of the prosthesis is implied if contrast material is seen dissecting around the prosthesis, an often difficult detection task because of adjacent prosthesis metal or cement. In conventional arthrography a preliminary mask image is thus used from which films obtained after injection of iodinated contrast material are subtracted. Movement by the patient during this process may preclude subsequent subtraction. With KEDSA, since multiple image pairs may be obtained after the injection of contrast material, the problem of patient motion is virtually eliminated. A conventional X-ray tube operating between 55 and 65 kVp was alternately filtered by iodine and cerium filters to produce the KEDSA images. The apparatus was capable of producing a subtracted image within 3 sec. The technique was applied to phantoms and to six patients immediately after hip arthrography that had been positive for prosthesis loosening. Although of lower spatial resolution, the KEDSA images were, in all cases, positive for loosening in a pattern consistent with the conventional arthrographic images. KEDSA was shown to be successful in detecting extraarticular contrast material. During a single study, subtraction in various imaging planes as well as postexercise subtraction imaging can be accomplished-techniques not heretofore possible in routine subtraction arthrography. 
Twelve-lead electrocardiographic evaluation of ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and its correlation with acute reocclusion. The sensitivity of the surface 12-lead electrocardiogram and that of standard (limb-lead) monitoring for the detection of ischemia during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were compared in 115 patients. The purpose was to identify the electrocardiographic leads that provide the most sensitive indicators of coronary ischemia during percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty and to evaluate the "ischemic fingerprint" that is obtained with 12-lead electrocardiogram during balloon inflation as a predictor of abrupt reocclusion after successful percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty procedures. During balloon inflations of 30 seconds, ischemia was detected in 61 of 145 vessels (42%) by limb-lead monitoring alone versus 130 of 145 vessels (90%) by 12-lead electrocardiography (p less than or equal to 0.001). In the nine patients (7.8%) who experienced abrupt reocclusion within 24 hours, the electrocardiogram during chest pain after percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty was identical to that obtained during percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty ("ischemic fingerprint"). None of the six patients who had chest pain after percutaneous transaluminal coronary angioplasty without evidence of abrupt reocclusion reproduced their ischemic fingerprint. The suggested optimal leads for monitoring ischemia are as follows: left anterior descending coronary artery, V2, and V3; circumflex artery, V2, and V3; and right coronary artery, III and aVF. 
Adenoma of type 2 pneumocytes with oncocytic features. An adenoma of type 2 pneumocytes in the periphery of the left lung was an incidental finding at the autopsy of a 28-year-old woman. Light microscopy revealed a predominantly papillary growth with oncocytic features. Ultrastructurally, multilaminated bodies and many mitochondria were found in the tumor cells and tubular myelin in the extracellular spaces. Immunohistochemistry revealed surfactant apoprotein in tumor cells and extracellularly. 
Vasovagal asystole during spinal anaesthesia. A patient in whom vasovagal asystole was induced by the performance of a spinal anaesthetic in the upright position is described. This illustrates the importance of routine monitoring of the electrocardiograph during regional anaesthesia. The risk of vasovagal syncope may be increased by the use of the sitting position and by the omission of anxiolytic premedication. 
Motor initiation versus execution in normal and Parkinson's disease subjects. We studied motor initiation and execution using wrist extension movements to changing target locations in eight normal subjects and nine Parkinson's disease (PD) patients before and after medications. Late changes resulted in double trajectories, indicating commitment to the initial target acquisition program followed by a correcting movement. There was compensation for earlier changes, even after onset of agonist muscle activity, resulting in a single trajectory, implying that the original trajectory had not yet been specified. However, movements were slowed in PD patients implying an abnormality in the content of the target acquisition program but not in the timing of its specification. In PD patients, the timing of the second movement onset correlated best with the timing of target location change and did not depend on initial movement completion. Thus, PD patients were able to program the second movement while the first movement was under way. 
Sonoelasticity imaging: results in in vitro tissue specimens. The authors present a method for imaging tissue stiffness (sonoelasticity) that has been developed and tested in a laboratory setting by using in vitro canine and human prostate glands. A low-frequency acoustic source was used to induce vibration in tissue under examination, and a color Doppler ultrasound (US) instrument was modified to detect vibration amplitude. The resulting image is a color "map" of tissue vibration superimposed on conventional gray-scale US images. Stiffer tissues vibrated less in response to audible sound, regardless of echogenicity. Normal human and canine prostate glands demonstrated a uniform vibration pattern. Four of four human prostatic adenocarcinomas and two stiff inclusions injected into canine prostate glands demonstrated a lack of vibration in comparison with normal surrounding tissue. The authors conclude that while further study is necessary, sonoelasticity imaging may enhance the detection of neoplasms by enabling their identification solely on the basis of stiffness. 
Prognostic factors associated with recurrence in clinical stage I adenocarcinoma of the endometrium. Two hundred sixty-four consecutive patients with clinical stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma who underwent primary surgical therapy between July 1979 and August 1988 were followed prospectively and evaluated for disease recurrence for 8-112 months (mean 51.5). Thirty-three patients (12.5%) developed recurrence or died of disease. In univariate statistical analysis, prognostic factors significantly associated with disease recurrence were as follows: age (mean 68.6 years with versus 60.3 years without recurrence; P = .0001); histology (adenocarcinoma 8.8%, adenosquamous 35.7%, papillary 25%, clear-cell 57.1%; P less than .0001); tumor grade (grade 1, 7.7%, grade 2, 10.5%, grade 3, 36.1%; P less than .0001); depth of myometrial invasion (none 9.8%, less than one-half 7.4%, one-half or greater 29.6%; P = .0001); lymph node status (negative 8.3%, positive 47.6%; P less than .0001); non-nodal extrauterine disease spread (absent 11.0%, present 50%; P = .0003); peritoneal cytology (negative 9.4%, positive 26.3%; P = .004), and tumor size (2 cm or less 7%, greater than 2 cm 17.3%; P = .05). Cervical extension and uterine size had no significant effect on recurrence. Using multivariate analysis, grade 3 tumor (P = .002), advancing age (P = .004), lymph node metastasis (P = .006), and presence of extrauterine disease spread other than lymph node metastasis (P = .038) were the only variables significantly associated with disease recurrence or death. This study supports the new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics surgical staging system for endometrial cancer. 
Preoperative and postoperative "aneurysm" associated with coarctation of the aorta. The reported incidence of aortic aneurysm after surgical repair or balloon angioplasty for aortic coarctation varies widely. To determine the incidence of aneurysm formation after surgery, preoperative and postoperative cineangiograms from 65 patients who underwent operation at age 1.5 +/- 3.4 years were examined. Repair included a prosthetic patch in 14 patients, end to end anastomosis in 28 and subclavian flap in 23. Aneurysm was documented by change in contour or irregularities in contour at the repair site or by abnormal dimensions at the repair site, defined by the ratio of the widest measurement at the repair site to the measurement of the aorta at the diaphragm. An aneurysmal bulge above the ductus diverticulum was identified in 14 (23%) of 60 patients preoperatively; the area showed no change 4.72 +/- 4.07 years after surgery. Significant changes at the repair site were seen in only three patients, all of whom had Dacron patch repair. One patient had a change in contour at the repair site, one had an abnormally high repair site to diaphragmatic aorta ratio and one had a progressive increase in this ratio. Thus, during childhood years, 3 (5%) of 65 patients were diagnosed as having aneurysm at the surgical repair site. In conclusion, 1) comparison with preoperative cineangiograms, especially for aneurysmal bulges above the ductus arteriosus, is essential before an aneurysm can be attributed to coarctation repair by any technique, and 2) aneurysm developed only in patients subjected to Dacron patch repair. 
Ki-1-positive lymphoma developing 10 years after the diagnosis of hairy cell leukemia. The case is described of a 62-year-old man with a 10-year history of hairy cell leukemia (HCL) who subsequently had a large-cell anaplastic or so-called Ki-1-positive lymphoma. Immunocytochemical staining of the lymphomatous node revealed positivity for Ki-1 (CD30) and epithelial membrane antigen in the tumor cells, and flow cytometric analysis showed simultaneous expression of Leu M5 (CD11c) and Leu 14 (CD22). Although HCL has been reported to coexist with both Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the authors believe this is the first case in which a Ki-1-positive lymphoma developed in a patient with HCL. The clinicopathologic and immunologic features of both entities are discussed, as is the association of HCL with other neoplasms. 
Evaluation of a new weaning index based on ventilatory endurance and the efficiency of gas exchange. We hypothesized that the ventilatory capacity needed to wean from mechanical ventilation (mv) depends on two variables: ventilatory endurance and the efficiency of gas exchange. We also hypothesized that these variables could be assessed from data readily available at the bedside, including tidal volume (VT) on mv and during spontaneous breathing (sb), ventilator peak inspiratory pressure (Ppk), and patient negative inspiratory pressure (NIP). Ventilatory endurance was evaluated using a modified pressure-time index: PTI = TI/Ttot x Pbreath/NIP, where Pbreath = Ppk x VTsb/VTmv. Defining VE40 as the minute ventilation needed to bring PaCO2 to 40 mm Hg, the efficiency of gas exchange was evaluated by calculating VE40/VTsb = (VE x PaCO2)mv/VTsb x 40. Because high levels of inspiratory effort might cause patients to reduce VTsb and thereby compromise CO2 elimination, we devised a weaning index (WI) that combines ventilatory endurance and the efficiency of gas exchange: WI = PTI x (VE40/VTsb). The study population comprised 38 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, adult respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, neuromuscular disease, and miscellaneous other conditions. They had been mechanically ventilated more than 3 days and were considered by clinical criteria to be ready for weaning. Of 46 weaning trials, 19 were successful, 2 were partially successful, and 25 failed. PTI and VE40/VTsb were higher in patients who failed (p less than 0.05), but neither variable alone had sufficient sensitivity or specificity to predict the outcome of weaning trials accurately. 
Symptoms associated with tamoxifen treatment in postmenopausal women. Adjuvant breast cancer therapy with tamoxifen is associated with greater disease-free survival and possibly overall survival. Long-term treatment, possibly of indefinite duration, is being evaluated. Compliance with long-term therapy will depend largely on the nature and severity of tamoxifen's side effects. We evaluated the symptoms associated with tamoxifen therapy in 140 postmenopausal women with axillary node negative breast cancer in remission (mean years since menopause, 9.3) enrolled in a placebo-controlled, randomized toxicity study. Tamoxifen recipients reported moderated or severe vasomotor symptoms up to 17%, and gynecologic symptoms up to 4% more frequently than placebo subjects. Persistent vasomotor, gynecologic, or other major side effects were reported by 48% of tamoxifen recipients, and by 21% of placebo subjects. These carefully collected data suggest significant perceived symptom 'cost' of tamoxifen therapy in postmenopausal women, of a magnitude likely to compromise long-term compliance. 
Nephrotoxic potential of Bence Jones proteins BACKGROUND. The renal manifestations of diseases associated with the production of monoclonal light chains--myeloma (cast) nephropathy, light-chain deposition disease, and amyloidosis AL--result from the deposition of certain Bence Jones proteins as tubular casts, basement-membrane precipitates, or fibrils, respectively. For unknown reasons, the severity of the renal manifestations of these diseases varies greatly from patient to patient. We employed an experimental in vivo model to determine the pathologic importance of various Bence Jones proteins. METHODS. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 300 mg of Bence Jones protein from 40 patients with multiple myeloma or amyloidosis AL and killed 48 hours later. The mouse kidneys were examined by light and electron microscopy, and light-chain deposits were identified immunohistochemically with highly specific antihuman light-chain antiserum. RESULTS. Of the 40 different human Bence Jones proteins studied, 26 were deposited in the mouse kidneys predominantly as tubular casts, basement-membrane precipitates, or crystals; no light-chain deposits were detected in the kidneys of the mice that received the other 14 Bence Jones proteins. Of the 18 patients for whom renal tissue was available for study, the findings in 14 were comparable to those in the mice. Furthermore, the proteins obtained from 22 of the 27 patients whose serum creatinine concentrations equaled or exceeded 168 mumol per liter (1.9 mg per deciliter) were deposited in the mouse kidneys, whereas protein deposition occurred after the injection of proteins from only 4 of the 13 patients with serum creatinine concentrations below 168 mumol per liter. The repeated injection of Bence Jones proteins from two patients who had amyloidosis AL resulted in deposition of the protein in the mouse kidneys as amyloid. CONCLUSIONS. Particular Bence Jones proteins are primarily responsible for producing the distinctive types of protein deposition in renal tissue and the clinical manifestations that occur in patients with light-chain-associated diseases. This experimental model has potential value for the identification of nephrotoxic or amyloidogenic light chains. 
Level of axillary involvement by lymph node metastases from breast cancer is not an independent predictor of survival. We examined the relationship of axillary level of lymph node metastases from clinical stage I and II breast cancer to overall survival and disease-free survival rates in 135 patients who underwent complete axillary lymph node dissection to determine if anatomic level of axillary involvement (I vs II vs III) is an independent prognostic factor. All patients underwent either modified radical mastectomy or lumpectomy with axillary dissection and whole breast radiotherapy for breast cancer. Median follow-up was 6.9 years. We found no difference in overall survival or disease-free survival between patients whose highest or only level of axillary involvement was level I compared with patients whose highest or only level was II. Although patients whose highest level of nodal involvement was III had significantly worse overall survival and disease-free survival rates than patients whose highest nodal involvement was I or II, when patients were stratified by the total number of positive nodes (one to three vs four or more), there was no difference in overall survival or disease-free survival rates between levels I, II, and III. These findings indicate that the level of axillary involvement for stage II breast cancer is not of independent prognostic significance. 
In situ venous valve construction. A technique of in situ deep venous valve construction based on vein wall intussusception is described. The technique has been used to construct a size-matched, autogenous valve in the femoral vein of the dog. Forty-one valves have been constructed. Immediately after construction, all 41 were patent at ascending phlebography and Harvey's test showed them to be competent. Descending phlebography demonstrated competence in 38 valves. Hydrostatic testing was performed on 27 valves in the vertical position at pressure gradients in the range 0.2-250 cmH2O. Of these, 24 valves were fully competent. Six valves were studied at intervals between 1 and 112 days after construction. All six were competent by Harvey's test and five were competent at descending phlebography. There was no evidence of thrombosis in any valve. This technique may be suitable for replacement of deep venous valves in patients with the calf pump failure syndrome caused by deep venous reflux. 
Prognostic importance of collateral flow and residual coronary stenosis of the myocardial infarct artery after anterior wall Q-wave acute myocardial infarction. Residual high-grade coronary stenosis and collateral flow are frequent findings in the chronic phase after a Q-wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The prognostic importance of a residual stenosis of the infarct artery and of collateral flow to the infarct area was analyzed in a group of 102 young patients (mean age 35 years, range 22 to 39) who had survived an anterior wall Q-wave AMI. Patients whose only significant lesion (greater than 50% luminal diameter reduction) was in the proximal portion of the left anterior descending artery were enrolled in the study. A 50 to 74% diameter stenosis was present in 33 of 102 patients (32%), 43 (42%) had a 75 to 99% stenosis and 26% had a total occlusion of the infarct vessel. Collateral vessels, which were evaluated by a scoring system, were present in 52 of 102 patients (51%). Four percent had only faint (score 1), 17 of 102 patients (17%) had moderate and 32 patients (31%) had good collateral flow (score greater than 4). The 8-year cumulative mortality was 15.2%--an eightfold increase compared with the age-matched general population. No patient with less than 75% stenosis died during follow-up, whereas the cumulative 8-year mortality was 23 and 17% in patients with a 75 to 99% stenosis or total occlusion, respectively (p less than 0.01). Patients with at least moderate collateral flow had a mortality rate of 21%, versus 8% for patients without or with faint collateral flow (p less than 0.05). 
The recognition and control of occupational disease. Occupational diseases account each year in the United States for an estimated 50,000 to 70,000 deaths and 350,000 new cases of illness. Often, however, occupational diseases are not correctly diagnosed, because they mimic diseases due to other causes and because most physicians are not well trained in their recognition. Opportunities for prevention and treatment are therefore lost. The occupational history is the most effective means for proper diagnosis of occupational illness. It should routinely be obtained for every patient. A brief but systematic guide for obtaining an occupational history is presented in this report. Also, approaches are summarized for the recognition and diagnosis of such important occupational diseases as occupational cancer, asbestosis and other respiratory disorders, and occupational neuropsychologic disorders. The management and prevention of occupational diseases depend on reduction of hazardous exposures in the workplace and better education of workers, industrial managers, and physicians. This report outlines a program for the control of occupational disease based on (1) preventing exposures in the workplace, (2) premarket toxicity testing of new chemicals and technologies, and (3) astute clinical diagnosis. 
Beneficial effect of carotid endarterectomy in symptomatic patients with high-grade carotid stenosis. North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial Collaborators BACKGROUND. Without strong evidence of benefit, the use of carotid endarterectomy for prophylaxis against stroke rose dramatically until the mid-1980s, then declined. Our investigation sought to determine whether carotid endarterectomy reduces the risk of stroke among patients with a recent adverse cerebrovascular event and ipsilateral carotid stenosis. METHODS. We conducted a randomized trial at 50 clinical centers throughout the United States and Canada, in patients in two predetermined strata based on the severity of carotid stenosis--30 to 69 percent and 70 to 99 percent. We report here the results in the 659 patients in the latter stratum, who had had a hemispheric or retinal transient ischemic attack or a nondisabling stroke within the 120 days before entry and had stenosis of 70 to 99 percent in the symptomatic carotid artery. All patients received optimal medical care, including antiplatelet therapy. Those assigned to surgical treatment underwent carotid endarterectomy performed by neurosurgeons or vascular surgeons. All patients were examined by neurologists 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after entry and then every 4 months. End points were assessed by blinded, independent case review. No patient was lost to follow-up. RESULTS. Life-table estimates of the cumulative risk of any ipsilateral stroke at two years were 26 percent in the 331 medical patients and 9 percent in the 328 surgical patients--an absolute risk reduction (+/- SE) 17 +/- 3.5 percent (P less than 0.001). For a major or fatal ipsilateral stroke, the corresponding estimates were 13.1 percent and 2.5 percent--an absolute risk reduction of 10.6 +/- 2.6 percent (P less than 0.001). Carotid endarterectomy was still found to be beneficial when all strokes and deaths were included in the analysis (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Carotid endarterectomy is highly beneficial to patients with recent hemispheric and retinal transient ischemic attacks or nondisabling strokes and ipsilateral high-grade stenosis (70 to 99 percent) of the internal carotid artery. 
Epidemiologic and clinical aspects of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Epidemiologic studies have shown that insulin is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Clinical studies have also demonstrated positive correlations between insulin and blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor. Moreover, there is an inverse correlation between insulin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). These studies have provided evidence in support of the biologic plausibility of epidemiologic observations, but they have not clearly established insulin's role in the pathogenesis of human cardiovascular diseases (CVD) such as hypertension. In fact, there is considerable evidence that insulin resistance (abnormal nonoxidative glucose disposal), not hyperinsulinemia, is the primary insulin-related abnormality in human hypertension, and that hyperinsulinemia occurs as a response to insulin resistance. Skeletal muscle appears to be the primary site of insulin resistance in essential hypertension, although other organs, such as the kidneys and liver--key sites for cell and water homeostasis and lipoprotein regulation, respectively--may respond normally to insulin. Adipocytes also appear to be a site of insulin resistance. Thus, the putative interrelationship between hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, on the one hand, and with blood pressure and lipoproteins, on the other, is a complex one and may involve organ-specific insulin resistance. Altered cation transport is one of several mechanisms by which insulin resistance might raise blood pressure. The Na+, K(+)-ATPase and Ca(2+)-ATPase pumps are insulin sensitive. Thus, when insulin resistance is present, the activity of these pumps in the smooth muscle of the arterial wall might be reduced. This would lead to an intracellular accumulation of sodium and calcium, thereby sensitizing the vascular wall to pressor substances. Moreover, secondary hyperinsulinemia will occur, and insulin has been shown to stimulate sympathetic nervous system activity and to increase renal tubular absorption of sodium. Insulin is also a growth factor and therefore might have a trophic effect on the vessel wall, one that could initiate and/or sustain hypertension as well as atherosclerosis. Abnormal lipoprotein metabolism is yet another possible explanation for the accelerated atherosclerosis that has been observed in persons with abnormal carbohydrate tolerance and insulin resistance. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance both play a role in the expression of elevated very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels as well as in the depression of HDL levels. Coronary risk reduction has been disappointing when blood pressure has been lowered with treatment regimens based on thiazide diuretics and/or beta blockers. Thiazides and some beta blockers may further impair tissue insulin sensitivity and often cause blood lipoprotein abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The natural history of superficial femoral artery stenoses. Since the natural history of specific superficial femoral artery stenoses is not known, we examined progression rates of superficial femoral artery stenoses in 45 lower extremities found when arteriograms were obtained of 38 patients for symptomatic atherosclerotic disease in the opposite leg or abdomen. These initial superficial femoral artery arteriograms were compared with later arteriograms in 25 limbs, duplex scans in 27 limbs, and both modalities in 7 limbs. After a mean interval of 37 months, most superficial femoral artery stenoses (72%) did not progress. However, 12 superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed (28%; mean follow-up, 37 months, including 7 that occluded (17%). Superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed among patients who complained of symptom progression at a rate faster than that among asymptomatic patients (15.6%/year vs 3%/year; p = 0.006). Superficial femoral artery lesions also progressed more rapidly among patients whose contralateral superficial femoral artery was occluded (10%/year vs 1.6%/year; p = 0.04). By multivariate regression analysis, symptom progression and smoking history were predictive of superficial femoral artery stenosis progression. In the seven patients whose superficial femoral artery stenoses progressed to occlusion, the average rate of stenosis progression was 12%/year (maximum predicted rate, 30% per year by 95% confidence limit). These results indicate that superficial femoral artery stenoses usually progress with synchronous symptomatic deterioration. Other than symptom progression, only cumulative smoking history and contralateral superficial femoral artery occlusion could be associated with superficial femoral artery stenosis progression in this small series. 
Knowledge and beliefs about cancer in a socioeconomically disadvantaged population. Americans living in poverty experience a higher incidence of and greater mortality from cancer than the nonpoor. At least 50% of the difference in mortality is believed to be due to delay in diagnosis, although risk-promoting lifestyles and behaviors also contribute to decreased survival. A potential exacerbating factor among the poor is inadequate information and knowledge about cancer and its treatment. Interviews were conducted with 128 cancer patients from a socioeconomically disadvantaged population to assess knowledge of cancer and its treatment and to evaluate care-seeking behaviors. Results indicated that although patients relied primarily on their physicians for information about their disease and treatment, a number of misconceptions regarding cancer existed in this population. Notably, nearly 50% of the patients surveyed either denied or did not know that smoking was related to the development of cancer. Additionally, patients frequently reported inappropriate care-seeking behaviors when asked to respond to a series of common disease-related signs or symptoms. These findings suggest that misinformation and misconceptions regarding cancer and its treatment among patients in this sample may contribute to inappropriate care-seeking behaviors. 
Comparative safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of amphotericin B lipid complex and amphotericin B desoxycholate in healthy male volunteers. Amphotericin B lipid complex (ABLC), a lipid complex formulation of amphotericin B, and amphotericin B desoxycholate (AB) were compared for safety, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics in two groups of eight healthy male volunteers. After a 1-mg test dose, study drug was infused at 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg; the 0.5-mg/kg dose was not given to subjects receiving AB. ABLC caused few acute adverse effects except for mild somnolence (drowsiness) in six volunteers. In addition, three of eight ABLC recipient had asymptomatic, transient serum transaminase elevations that resolved spontaneously. The AB recipients experienced more acute side effects, but only one had a mild shaking chill: three of eight also experienced sleepiness. No significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, oximetry, pulmonary function, or clinical status were observed in either group. Due to its increased estimate volume of distribution and estimated clearance. ABLC yielded decreased amphotericin B levels and area under the serum concentration versus time curve relative to AB. 
Effects of sleep-induced increases in upper airway resistance on ventilation. To determine the effects of the sleep-induced increases in upper airway resistance on ventilatory output, we studied five subjects who were habitual snorers but otherwise normal while awake (AW) and during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep under the following conditions: 1) stage 2, low-resistance sleep (LRS); 2) stage 3-4, high-resistance sleep (HRS) (snoring); 3) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); 4) CPAP + end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) mode isocapnic to LRS; and 5) CPAP + PETCO2 isocapnic to HRS. We measured ventilatory output via pneumotachograph in the nasal mask, PETCO2, esophageal pressure, inspiratory and expiratory resistance (RL,I and RL,E). Changes in PETCO2 were confirmed with PCO2 measurements in arterialized venous blood in all conditions in one subject. During wakefulness, pulmonary resistance (RL) remained constant throughout inspiration, whereas in stage 2 and especially in stage 3-4 NREM sleep, RL rose markedly throughout inspiration. Expired minute ventilation (VE) decreased by 12% in HRS, and PETCO2 increased in LRS (3.3 Torr) and HRS (4.9 Torr). CPAP decreased RL,I to AW levels and increased end-expiratory lung volume 0.25-0.93 liter. Tidal volume (VT) and mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/TI) increased significantly with CPAP. Inspiratory time (TI) shortened, and PETCO2 decreased 3.6 Torr but remained 1.3 Torr above AW. During CPAP (RL,I equal to AW), with PETCO2 returned to the level of LRS, VT/TI and VE were 83 and 52% higher than during LRS alone. Also on CPAP, with PETCO2 made equal to HRS, VT, VT/TI, and VE were 67, 112, and 67% higher than during HRS alone. 
Total arthroplasty of the hip after childhood sepsis. Total hip arthroplasty was performed in 45 hips of 44 patients who had pyogenic arthritis of the hip during childhood. The average age of the patients was 36.4 years (range 19 to 50). The interval between active infection and arthroplasty ranged from 11 to 40 years, and average follow-up was 65.4 months (range 58 to 80). Specimens of tissue taken before and during operation gave negative cultures in all hips, and no patient had reactivation of infection. The mean functional rating of the hips was 58 points before operation and 90 at the final review. Complications were seen in 11 cases (24%), loosening of components occurred in six (13%) and one hip had to be revised for acetabular component migration. Acetabular allografts were required in 27 hips (60%). All allografts united but there was partial resorption of the graft in the non-weight-bearing area in all. 
Hemorrhagic venous infarction after excision of an arteriovenous malformation: case report. A case of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in which postoperative hemorrhagic infarction developed, probably because of occlusion of the former draining veins, is reported. The hemorrhage developed in the temporal lobe 3 days after the initial operation and was located in the immediate vicinity of the site of the AVM. The following findings suggest that the postsurgical hemorrhage probably resulted from a venous thrombosis: 1) no evidence of residual AVM; 2) delayed onset of the hemorrhage, inconsistent with the time course of a hemorrhage developing according to the breakthrough theory or with insufficient hemostasis with a high-pressure afterload; 3) good correlation between the location of the hemorrhage and the occlusion of the draining veins; and 4) multifocal hemorrhage affecting both the gray matter and the subcortical white matter. Postoperative hemorrhagic infarction caused by thrombosis in the draining veins is rare, but it should be considered as a distinct postoperative complication after removal of an AVM. 
Cell recovery during segmental intestinal perfusion in healthy subjects and patients with Crohn's disease. The recovery of cells arising from small intestinal mucosa alone was studied during continuous perfusion of a closed segment of jejunum. The perfusion technique minimised the contamination of the perfused segment with, for example, proteolytic enzymes from pancreas, allowing recovery of viable cells. The use of hyaluronidase in the perfusion fluid increased the recovery of cells fivefold, the median recovery being 8 x 10(6) cells. The cells were analysed with monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry. Nearly all cells (98-99%) recovered during perfusion of healthy control subjects and patients with Crohn's disease were epithelial cells. The jejunal cells expressed HLA-DR in similar proportions--around 30%--in patients and control subjects. The ratio between CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes was similar (0.2) in control subjects and patients with inactive Crohn's disease but decreased (0.03) in patients with active Crohn's disease in the ileum. 
Candidal mediastinitis after surgical repair of esophageal perforation. Candidal mediastinitis, like Boerhaave's syndrome, is uncommon, and both, if treated late or incompletely, frequently result in death. Early recognition and aggressive medical and surgical intervention are the best means to convalescence and cure in both conditions. 
Postischemic myocardial "stunning". Identification of major differences between the open-chest and the conscious dog and evaluation of the oxygen radical hypothesis in the conscious dog. Recent studies suggest that oxygen-derived free radicals contribute to the pathogenesis of postischemic myocardial dysfunction (myocardial "stunning"). This concept, however, is predicated exclusively on results obtained in open-chest preparations, which are subject to the confounding influence of many unphysiological conditions. The lack of supporting evidence in more physiological animal models represents a major persisting limitation of the oxy-radical hypothesis of myocardial stunning. The goal of this study was to address two fundamental (and related) questions: 1) Does the open-chest animal model alter the phenomenon of myocardial stunning? 2) If so, how valid are the concepts, derived from such a model, regarding the pathogenetic role of oxy-radicals? In part 1 of the study, myocardial stunning after a 15-minute coronary occlusion was compared in 30 pentobarbital-anesthetized open-chest dogs and in 19 conscious dogs. For any given level of collateral flow during occlusion, the recovery of systolic wall thickening after reperfusion was markedly less in open-chest animals. In an additional group of five open-chest dogs, a close inverse relation was noted between body temperature and postischemic wall thickening, indicating that the recovery of the stunned myocardium in acute experiments may vary markedly depending on how temperature is controlled. Because of these major differences between open-chest and conscious dogs, the oxy-radical hypothesis needs to be tested in the latter model. Thus, in part 2 of the study, conscious unsedated dogs undergoing a 15-minute coronary occlusion were randomized to an intravenous infusion of either saline (19 coronary occlusions) or superoxide dismutase (SOD) plus catalase (CAT) (21 coronary occlusions). Despite the fact that the plasma levels of SOD and CAT declined rapidly after reperfusion, postischemic wall thickening was significantly greater in treated compared with control dogs throughout the first 6 hours of reflow. Thus, a brief (60-minute) infusion of SOD and CAT produced a sustained improvement of recovery of contractility. The magnitude of this beneficial effect was a function of the severity of ischemia: the lower the collateral perfusion, the greater the improvement effected by the enzymes. The accelerated recovery produced by SOD and CAT was not followed by any deterioration of contractility, suggesting that postischemic dysfunction is not a teleologically "protective" phenomenon. In conclusion, the severity of myocardial stunning is greatly exaggerated by the unphysiological conditions present in the barbiturate-anesthetized open-chest dog.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Suppressor T-cell deficiency in primary sclerosing cholangitis. Case and family study. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is considered to be an autoimmune disease of the liver in which there is an association with the HLA phenotypes B8 and DR3 and in which circulating autoantibodies occur. Abnormalities of immune regulation may be present but whether or not they are primary or acquired is not known. This report is of a patient with primary sclerosing cholangitis who was homozygous for HLA B8 DR3, had a circulating antinuclear antibody, and a defect in nonspecific suppressor T-cell activity despite glucocorticosteroid treatment. Nevertheless, family studies revealed no evidence of an immunoregulatory defect in first-degree relatives despite the presence of Raynaud's phenomenon and malignancy in two sisters. 
Chondroblastomalike extraskeletal chondroma. An unusual extraskeletal tumor occurring in the right thumb of a 44-year-old man exhibited histologically a chondroblastomalike appearance. The tumor was characterized by dense proliferation of chondroblastic cells admixed with a few multinucleated giant cells of osteoclast type. The patient had no evidence of local recurrence or metastasis three-and-a-half years after a simple excision. 
Novel approach to iatrogenic bile peritonitis. Bile peritonitis after injury to the biliary tree is a serious complication that requires exploratory laparotomy. Our patient had an obstructing ampullary carcinoma, and generalized bile peritonitis developed from attempted percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography. The patient's condition was managed by peritoneal lavage and endoscopic transampullary stenting, with immediate relief of pain and toxicity. Exploratory laparotomy was avoided, and an eventual pylorus-sparing Whipple resection was the definitive treatment. We believe this to be the first report of successful nonoperative treatment of a patient with bile peritonitis with obstructive jaundice. 
Prognostic value of galactose elimination capacity, aminopyrine breath test, and ICG clearance in patients with cirrhosis. Comparison with the Pugh score. Seventy-eight patients with cirrhosis were prospectively followed for up to 20 months, on the average. At entry into the study, galactose elimination capacity, aminopyrine breath test, and ICG clearance were measured. At the end of the study, 27 patients had died. Univariate analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method showed that both quantitative liver function tests (galactose elimination capacity: P less than 0.025; aminopyrine breath test: P less than 0.001; ICG clearance: P less than 0.005) and common clinical and biochemical data (encephalopathy: P less than 0.001; ascites: P less than 0.001; serum bilirubin: P less than 0.005; serum albumin: P less than 0.001; prothrombin index: P less than 0.05) were significant predictors of survival. To investigate whether quantitative liver function tests could contribute to a better definition of the prognosis, once Pugh score had already been taken into account, a multiple regression analysis according to the Cox model was performed. Pugh score and galactose elimination capacity resulted in the only independent prognostic covariates. From them a prognostic index was calculated, and the model was validated in an additional sample of 70 patients investigated according to the same protocol. The contribution GEC gave to the assessment of overall prognosis over that obtained using the Pugh score was slight, as estimated by the statistical parameters of the Cox's model, but was significant as assessed by a ROC curve analysis (P = 0.05). These data show that all quantitative liver function tests were predictors of survival in cirrhosis, and that the galactose elimination capacity added some new prognostic information to those already available using the Child-Turcotte-Pugh classification. 
Regional differences in elastic recoil after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: a quantitative angiographic study. The immediate result of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is influenced by both plastic and elastic changes of the vessel wall. To evaluate the amount of elastic recoil after coronary balloon angioplasty, the minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the largest balloon used at highest inflation pressure was compared with the minimal luminal vessel cross-sectional area directly after final balloon deflation in 607 lesions (526 patients). Elastic recoil was defined as the difference between balloon cross-sectional area and minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the dilated coronary segment immediately after balloon withdrawal. A videodensitometric analysis technique was used to avoid geometric assumptions on stenosis morphology directly after angioplasty. Mean balloon cross-sectional area was 5.3 +/- 1.6 mm2 and minimal luminal cross-sectional area after angioplasty was 2.8 +/- 1.4 mm2. Reference areas before and after angioplasty did not differ (6.0 +/- 2.6 and 6.2 +/- 2.6 mm2, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed that asymmetric lesions, lesions located in less angulated parts of the artery and lesions with a low plaque content showed more elastic recoil. Lesions located in distal parts of the coronary tree were also associated with more elastic recoil probably related to relative balloon oversizing in these distal lesions. 
Differentiation in B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell populations with CD34-positive subpopulations. B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia bone marrow specimens that contained subpopulations of cells with immunophenotypes corresponding to early (CD34) and late (CD20) and (CD22) stages of normal B-cell differentiation were studied. Subpopulations of cells were isolated according to immunophenotype and then analyzed by both a clonogenic assay and molecular genetic methods. Clonal equivalence of the early and late immunophenotypic subpopulations was confirmed for each case by the demonstration of identical lg gene rearrangements. The in vitro colony-forming assay consistently showed a growth advantage for the CD34+ subpopulations over the CD34- subpopulations. CD34 mRNA was detected readily in these isolated precursor cells. When two specimens in which virtually all of the leukemia cells were CD34+ and CD34+CD20+ and CD34+CD22+ subpopulations were also present the CD34 mRNA was limited to the cells without the late-stage differentiation antigens on their surface. Furthermore, the c-myb mRNA was found only in the subpopulations that also contained CD34 mRNA. Our results show that a limited program of differentiation reminiscent of normal B-cell development may be present in this leukemia. 
Global T wave inversion. Because global T wave inversion has not been specifically characterized, 100 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with this pattern (frontal plane T vector -100 degrees to -170 degrees with precordial T inversion) were prospectively collected from approximately 30,000 consecutively interpreted ECGs and analyzed blindly. There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs. 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions. There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs. -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034). The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36). Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization. Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion. Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries. 
Somato-somatic referred pain caused by suprasegmental spinal cord tumor. Tactile stimulation of a coin-sized area in a T-2 dermatome consistently triggered a lancinating pain in the ipsilateral C-8 dermatome in a 38-year-old woman. The SEP and an MRI led to a diagnosis of a tumor at the left cervico-medullary junction, much higher than the clinically suspected level. Surgical exploration revealed an exophytic glioma, and the pain was abolished postoperatively. Ephaptic transmission at the tumor site was suspected as a pathophysiologic mechanism. 
Early constrictive pericarditis and anemia after Dressler's syndrome and inferior wall myocardial infarction. Early constrictive pericarditis and anaemia developed in a 52 year old man after he had an inferior wall myocardial infarction complicated by Dressler's syndrome. Total pericardiectomy at the time of coronary artery bypass surgery resulted in complete resolution of signs and symptoms. 
Effect of sinorphan, an enkephalinase inhibitor, on plasma atrial natriuretic factor and sodium urinary excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites. We examined the acute effects of sinorphan, an inhibitor of enkephalinase, on plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and urinary sodium excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites. A single oral dose of sinorphan (100 or 30 mg in 11 and 5 patients, respectively) was administered against placebo according to a double blind cross-over protocol. Basal plasma ANF levels varied over a large range between 2.6-79 pmol/L. Sinorphan, at a dose of 100 mg, inhibited 70% of plasma enkephalinase activity 60 min after ingestion and elicited simultaneously an increase in plasma ANF and cGMP levels 1.8 and 1.5 times basal values, respectively. There was a transient increase in sodium urinary output without a change in creatinine clearance over the initial 2-h period following drug administration. An increase in urinary cGMP was also observed on a longer period of 6 h. Plasma aldosterone decreased significantly, but the lowest concentration was reached 1 h later than the peak of plasma ANF. Mean blood pressure and PRA were unmodified. The effects of 30 mg sinorphan on plasma ANF, cGMP, and aldosterone were also significant, but less marked than those of the higher dose. Therefore, enkephalinase inhibition transiently increases sodium urinary excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites via a mechanism that is likely to imply reduction of ANF catabolism. These results suggest that ANF could play a role in the control of sodium homeostasis in liver cirrhosis with ascites. 
Aneurysm of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery unrelated to the cerebellopontine angle: case report. This is a case report of an unusual aneurysm of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery. A 44-year-old woman had a severe frontal headache and vomiting of sudden onset. On the day after admission, the patient began to demonstrate nuchal rigidity and difficulty with upward gaze bilaterally. There were no complaints at this time suggestive of a syndrome of the cerebellopontine angle. A computed tomographic scan revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage of the 3rd and 4th ventricles; however, multiple attempts at four-vessel angiography were required before an aneurysm could be demonstrated. On the 28th hospital day, a suboccipital craniectomy using the retromastoid approach in the lateral position was performed. A saccular aneurysm with a surrounding hematoma in the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery was found and clipped. The operative findings revealed that the aneurysm was unrelated to the cerebellopontine angle. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery and complete resolution of symptoms. 
Cancer incidence in Norwegian Seventh-Day Adventists 1961 to 1986. Is the cancer-life-style association overestimated? Standardized incidence ratio for cancer in Norwegian Seventh-Day Adventists compared with the general population was not significantly different from unity (men 91, women 97). Persons converting late in life had a higher incidence than those converting at an earlier age. Respiratory cancers (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 59, 95% CI = 36 to 91) and cancers with an unspecified site (SIR 53, 95% CI = 25 to 97) were rarer and cancer of the uterine corpus (SIR 164, 95% CI = 109 to 237) was more common in Seventh-Day Adventists before the age of 75 years. Inclusion of all registered Seventh-Day Adventists regardless of religious activity and the relatively low cancer incidence rates in the Norwegian population could contribute to the nonsignificant result with regard to total cancer. Main etiologic factors in cancer development in Norway should be sought in areas where Seventh-Day Adventists do not differ from the general population. 
Epileptogenic effect of hypoxia in the immature rodent brain. The response to cerebral hypoxia/ischemia may be different in the neonate compared to other age groups. An in vivo model was developed in the rat to determine whether there are age-dependent differences in the effects of hypoxia on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. EEG recordings were obtained from Long Evans hooded rats deprived of oxygen at five ages: postnatal days 5 to 7, 10 to 12, 15 to 17, 25 to 27, and 50 to 60. Oxygen concentration was varied from 0, 2, 3, and 4% between animals. EEGs were recorded in all animals before, during, and at 1 hour after exposure to the hypoxic condition and at 1 to 7 days afterward in a subset of animals. All animals were deprived of oxygen until the onset of apnea and bradycardia to 20 to 40% of baseline heart rate values. Hypoxia resulted in isoelectric EEG significantly more frequently in the animals deprived of oxygen at postnatal days 25 to 27 and 50 to 60 than in the younger age groups. A highly significant effect was that the animals deprived at postnatal days 5 to 17 revealed a high incidence of epileptiform EEG activity during hypoxia. In contrast, the older animals exhibited only rare isolated EEG spikes before reaching an isoelectric EEG. The severity of hypoxia-induced epileptiform EEG changes was highest in the animals subjected to moderately hypoxic conditions (3% and 4% oxygen) at postnatal days 10 to 12. Furthermore, epileptiform changes persisted for hours to days following prolonged episodes of hypoxia in the younger animals. This study demonstrates a unique response of the immature brain to exhibit epileptiform activity during hypoxia. 
Childhood cancer among the Polynesian population. From June 1981 through June 1989, 95 Polynesian children were seen for initial care of malignancy at the Princess Mary Hospital for Children (PMHC). The incidence of malignancy in the Polynesian populations served, the histology of the malignancies, and the outcome of therapy were reviewed and compared with 185 non-Polynesian (non-P) patients seen during the same period. Incidence figures for Polynesians and non-P were similar, but histologic patterns differed, showing an increased occurrence of leukemia, particularly nonlymphoblastic leukemia, an increased occurrence of bone tumors, and a decreased incidence of central nervous system tumors for Polynesians. Survival for Polynesian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was worse than for non-P. Survival in all other disease categories was similar. 
Hemorrhagic events during therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, heparin, and aspirin for acute myocardial infarction. Results of the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI), Phase II Trial. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of invasive procedures, hemostatic and clinical variables, the timing of beta-blocker therapy, and the doses of recombinant plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on hemorrhagic events. DESIGN: A multicenter, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Hospitals participating in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II trial (TIMI II). INTERVENTIONS: Patients received rt-PA, heparin, and aspirin. The total dose of rt-PA was 150 mg for the first 520 patients and 100 mg for the remaining 2819 patients. Patients were randomly assigned to an invasive strategy (coronary arteriography with percutaneous angioplasty [if feasible] done routinely 18 to 48 hours after the start of thrombolytic therapy) or to a conservative strategy (coronary arteriography done for recurrent spontaneous or exercise-induced ischemia). Eligible patients were also randomly assigned to either immediate intravenous or deferred beta-blocker therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were monitored for hemorrhagic events during hospitalization. MAIN RESULTS: In patients on the 100-mg rt-PA regimen, major and minor hemorrhagic events were more common among those assigned to the invasive than among those assigned to the conservative strategy (18.5% versus 12.8%, P less than 0.001). Major or minor hemorrhagic events were associated with the extent of fibrinogen breakdown, peak rt-PA levels, thrombocytopenia, prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) to more than 90 seconds, weight of 70 kg or less, female gender, and physical signs of cardiac decompensation. Immediate intravenous beta-blocker therapy had no important effect on hemorrhagic events when compared with delayed beta-blocker therapy. Intracranial hemorrhages were more frequent among patients treated with the 150-mg rt-PA dose than with the 100-mg rt-PA dose (2.1% versus 0.5%, P less than 0.001). The extent of the plasmin-mediated hemostatic defect was also greater in patients receiving the 150-mg dose. CONCLUSIONS: Increased morbidity due to hemorrhagic complications is associated with an invasive management strategy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Our findings show the complex interaction of several factors in the occurrence of hemorrhagic events during thrombolytic therapy. 
Treatment of unresectable meningiomas with the antiprogesterone agent mifepristone. The possibility that meningioma growth may be related to female sex hormone levels is suggested by several lines of evidence. Meningiomas are twice as common in women as in men, have been observed to wax and wane with pregnancy, and are positively associated with breast cancer. A physiological explanation for these phenomena is provided by the finding of steroid hormone receptors in meningiomas. However, unlike breast cancer, meningiomas are much more commonly positive for progesterone receptors than for estrogen receptors. The authors initiated a study on long-term oral therapy of unresectable meningiomas with the antiprogesterone mifepristone (RU486). Fourteen patients received mifepristone in daily doses of 200 mg for periods ranging from 2 to 31+ months (greater than or equal to 6 months in 12 patients). Five patients have shown signs of objective response (reduced tumor measurement on computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance image, or improved visual field examination). Three have also experienced subjective improvement (improved extraocular muscle function or relief from headache). The side effects of long-term mifepristone therapy have been mild. Fatigue was noted in 11 of the 14 patients. Other side effects included hot flashes in five patients, gynecomastia in three, partial alopecia in two, and cessation of menses in two. Long-term therapy with mifepristone is a new therapeutic option that may have efficacy in cases of unresectable benign meningioma. 
Transscleral leiomyoma. A bluish-pink epibulbar lesion, which slowly enlarged over a period of 5 years, developed in a 31-year-old woman. The lesion initially resembled a staphyloma, based on the very thinned overlying sclera, but subsequent evaluation suggested that it was a solid mass. At the time of surgical removal, the mass appeared to have originated in the supraciliary region and to have eroded outward through the sclera. Histopathologically, the mass proved to be a leiomyoma. The authors propose theoretic possibilities to explain the location of this rare type of ocular smooth muscle tumor. 
Detection of intraoperative laser injury to the facial nerve by electromyographic monitoring of facial muscles. Injury to the facial nerve is a significant risk during resection of cerebellopontine angle tumors. To minimize the risk of facial nerve injury, intraoperative electromyographic monitoring of facial musculature is frequently used. However, the reliability of such monitoring systems for detection of thermal nerve injury resulting from the use of carbon dioxide lasers has not been systematically evaluated. We determined the sensitivity of a computerized electromyographic monitor for detection of laser facial nerve injury in an anesthetized rat model. The mandibular and buccal branches of the facial nerve were isolated in 12 rats. A carbon dioxide laser was used to create controlled sites of thermal injury to both nerves over a 3-hour period. When a laser injury was created distal to previous injury sites, electromyographic discharge was noted in 72% to 82% of injuries. Laser injury proximal to previous injury sites was detected with 33% efficiency. These detection rates did not change significantly over a 3-hour period. This preliminary data suggests that electromyographic monitoring of facial musculature allows detection of facial nerve injury caused by carbon dioxide lasers. 
Morphologic comparison of frequency and types of acute lesions in the major epicardial coronary arteries in unstable angina pectoris, sudden coronary death and acute myocardial infarction. The frequency and type of acute lesions in the four major (right, left main, left anterior descending, left circumflex) epicardial coronary arteries were examined at necropsy in 14 patients with unstable angina pectoris, 21 patients with sudden coronary death and 32 patients with a fatal first acute myocardial infarction. None of the 67 patients had a grossly visible left ventricular scar (healed myocardial infarct) and only the group with acute myocardial infarction had left ventricular myocardial necrosis. Although the frequency of intraluminal thrombus was similar in patients with unstable angina (29%) and sudden death (29%) and significantly lower than in those with acute infarction (69%) (p = 0.02), the thrombus in the patients with unstable angina and sudden death consisted almost entirely of platelets and was nonocclusive, whereas the thrombus in the group with acute infarction consisted almost entirely of fibrin and was occlusive. The frequency of plaque rupture was insignificantly different in the groups with unstable angina (36%) and sudden death (19%), and was significantly lower than in the group with acute infarction (75%) (p = 0.02). The frequency of plaque hemorrhage was insignificantly different in the groups with unstable angina (64%) and sudden death (38%) and was significantly lower than in the group with acute infarction (90%) (p = 0.04). 
Adrenal hemangioma: an unusual adrenal mass delineated with magnetic resonance imaging. Adrenal hemangioma should be included in the differential diagnosis of any large calcified adrenal mass. We report to our knowledge the eighth surgically removed lesion and describe its appearance on magnetic resonance imaging. This imaging includes features seen in hemangiomas elsewhere, in particular a heterogeneous mass with enhancing peripheral high intensity foci on T1 images. 
A modified technique of pre-operative aortography to demonstrate the complete arterial tree of the lower limb. One hundred consecutive aortograms were studied to establish the efficacy of conventional arteriography in demonstrating distal vessels and the pedal arch. The standard technique was modified by using a long injection time, a large volume of contrast material (iopamidol 370), prolonged filming and multiple exposures of the feet. On the basis of these examinations each limb was classified as having aorto-iliac disease (18 limbs), superficial femoral disease (103 limbs), combined segment disease (28 limbs) or generalised disease (51 limbs). Calf and ankle arteries were seen in 196 of the 200 limbs (98%). Patency of the pedal arch was established in 184 (92%). Fourteen percent of the group of patients with combined segment disease did not have their pedal arch visualised and this group contained most of the examination failures. This modified method of aortography can demonstrate the entire arterial tree from the aorta to the foot in 92% of limbs with symptomatic chronic atherosclerotic disease. This allows the majority of peripheral vascular reconstructions to be planned and performed without the need for intra-operative arteriography. 
Hyperbaric treatment of cerebral air embolism sustained during an open-heart surgical procedure A case of cerebral air embolism sustained during replacement of the mitral valve resulted in postoperative coma and seizures. Hyperbaric treatment, begun 30 hours after the occurrence of the air embolism, resulted in good immediate and long-term recovery. Mild deficits of the left hemisphere were present at follow-up 53 days after the embolus was sustained, and lesser, minimal residua were present at 14-month follow-up. Hyperbaric treatment is the definitive therapy for cerebral air embolism. Although it is most effective when administered early, the outcome may be excellent even with late treatment. 
Growth of human basal cell carcinomas transplanted to C57/Balb/C bgJ/bgJ nu/nu (beige-nude) mice. The purpose of this study was to measure growth parameters of transplanted basal cell carcinoma (BCC) to beige-nude mice during a 4-month observation time. Forty male beige-nude mice were transplanted with human BCC with our reported subcutaneous implantation technique. Initial volume and wet weight were determined for each tumor. The tumors were measured every 2 weeks by calipers with a final volume determined at 120 days, at which time the tumors were harvested, weighed, and processed for routine histology. Thirty-two tumor sites were positive for persistent tumor at harvest. Tumor volumes declined by an average of 51% and average tumor weight by 33%. There were increased numbers of mast cells surrounding the BCC tumor lobules. These results indicate that BCC can survive for 120 days in the beige-nude mouse. 
Carbon dioxide laser energy disperses human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid onto treatment fields. The possibility of dispersing viral deoxyribonucleic acid during carbon dioxide laser treatment of human papillomavirus-containing genital infections has been investigated with a commercially available dot blot hybridization technique. The viral ribonucleic acid probes were specific for groups of human papillomavirus types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35. Laser energy was delivered by continuous-wave mode and the plume of smoke was evacuated by a vacuum suction system. Samples were taken with Dacron swabs from lesional tissues of 43 patients as well as from the treated areas and from the 5 cm surrounding normal skin before and after laser vaporization. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was identified in swabs from 34 of 43 (79%) lesional tissues and 7 of 43 (16%) treatment fields. Although a trend for higher human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid positivity in laser margins after therapy (7/43, 16%) than before (4/43, 9%) was observed, the rates were not statistically significant. It is concluded that carbon dioxide laser energy disperses human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid onto treatment fields and the adjacent normal epithelium. Viral contamination of treated areas may be reduced by positioning the fume evacuator within 1 cm of the field of laser vaporization and cleaning the treated areas and surrounding tissue after therapy. 
Bouveret's syndrome: an unusual twist on the classic cause. Bouveret's syndrome is a duodenal obstruction caused by a gallstone, manifested mostly as a gastric outlet obstruction. We have reported an instance of Bouveret's syndrome caused by two separate stones, either of which could independently have caused the obstruction. It is imperative to be sure that the obstruction is relieved before terminating the operative procedure. 
Angiographic management of retroperitoneal hemorrhage from renal angiomyolipoma in polycystic kidney disease. Angiographic management of bilateral angiomyolipomas complicated by hemorrhage in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is presented. The patient had mild stigmata of tuberous sclerosis, and a family history of tuberous sclerosis and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The radiographic features at diagnosis, and those present during and after embolization are described. Radiological criteria for diagnosis and successful control of bleeding with intra-arterial selective embolization are discussed. Radiographic features before, during and after embolization are exhibited. 
Specificity of low dose fadrozole hydrochloride (CGS 16949A) as an aromatase inhibitor. CGS 16949A (fadrozole hydrochloride), a potent cytochrome P450-mediated steroidogenesis inhibitor, blocks aromatase at low doses, but other biosynthetic steps at higher concentrations. Recent studies demonstrated inhibition of C11-hydroxylase, corticosterone methyloxidase-II, and deoxycorticosterone to corticosterone conversion with this agent at some-what higher concentrations than those required for blockade of aromatase. Based upon phase I studies, we postulated that relatively selective inhibition of aromatase might be possible if sufficiently low doses of CGS 16949A were used. A phase II study in 54 postmenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer examined the effects of low dose CGS 16949A on estrogen, mineralocorticoid, and glucocorticoid secretion. Two dose schedules and two dose levels were chosen based upon our prior dose escalation protocol study. Plasma estrone, estradiol, and estrone sulfate as well as urinary estrone and estradiol fell equally with 1.8-4 mg CGS 16949A given either on a twice daily or three times daily dose schedule. Isotopic kinetic studies demonstrated an 84% decrease in the rate of conversion of androstenedione to estrone to 0.40 +/- 0.07% (patients receiving 1.8-4 mg CGS 16949A daily). With these three regimens, basal levels of aldosterone and cortisol did not change significantly over a 12-week period of observation. Clinical examination, plasma electrolytes, and urinary sodium/potassium ratios suggested no biological evidence of mineralo-corticoid deficiency. ACTH-stimulated cortisol concentrations, however, were blunted at each dose level compared to pretreatment values. Nonetheless, peak responses exceeded 550 nmol/L, or a basal to peak difference of 190 nmol/L or greater, in 97% of instances. This probably reflected inhibition of C11-hydroxylase, since basal and ACTH-stimulated levels of 11-deoxycortisol were increased in response to CGS 16949A. Androstenedione and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone also exhibited an upward trend in response to drug treatment. ACTH-stimulated aldosterone levels were blunted to a greater extent than those of cortisol, probably as a reflection of corticosterone methyloxidase type II blockade. Overall, the results suggest that CGS 16949A, at doses of 1.8-2 mg daily, blocks aromatase effectively and does not produce clinically important inhibition of cortisol or aldosterone biosynthesis. Thus, this agent can probably be used safely without glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid supplementation. 
Isolated neurofibromas of the conjunctiva. We studied four histologically verified cases of isolated neurofibromas of the conjunctiva. The histologic pattern was diffuse in two patients, plexiform in one patient, and solitary in one patient. Simple excision was curative in all cases. We emphasize the importance of distinguishing neuromas (which may be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia) from neurofibromas. 
Double anal canal: complication of rectal fecalith. Fecaliths and stercoraceous ulcerations are well-known complications of chronic constipation. The authors present the case of a double anal canal in an elderly man. This anorectal fistula (complex anal fistula) developed as a complication of an impacted rectal fecalith with resultant stercoraceous ulceration. Eventually, a persistent epithelialized canal developed and was demonstrated at double-contrast barium enema examination. The patient remained continent at all times. 
Vegetative state after closed-head injury. A Traumatic Coma Data Bank Report. To elucidate the clinical course of the vegetative state after severe closed-head injury, the Traumatic Coma Data Bank was analyzed for outcome at the time of discharge from the hospital and after follow-up intervals ranging up to 3 years after injury. Of 650 patients with closed-head injury available for analysis, 93 (14%) were discharged in a vegetative state. In comparison with conscious survivors, patients in a vegetative state sustained more severe closed-head injury as reflected by the Glasgow Coma Scale scores and pupillary findings and more frequently had diffuse injury complicated by swelling or shift in midline structures. Of 84 patients in a vegetative state who provided follow-up data, 41% became conscious by 6 months, 52% regained consciousness by 1 year, and 58% recovered consciousness within the 3-year follow-up interval. A logistic regression failed to identify predictors of recovery from the vegetative state. 
Similar outcome of treatment of B-cell and T-cell diffuse large-cell lymphomas: the Stanford experience. Although previous studies have suggested a relatively poor prognosis for some patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, the clinical significance of immunologic phenotype in diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) remains controversial. One hundred one patients with a uniform morphologic diagnosis of DLCL treated at Stanford between 1975 and 1986 with cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP), methotrexate, bleomycin, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dexamethasone ([M]BACOD), or methotrexate, Adriamycin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (MACOP-B) chemotherapy were studied with regard to immunologic phenotype. Immunologic analysis, performed on frozen or paraffin-embedded tissue, identified 77 cases of B-cell origin, 21 cases of T-cell origin, and three cases that lacked B-cell or T-cell markers. Analysis of complete remission (CR) rates (84% v 95%), 5-year actuarial freedom from disease progression (38% v 53%), and 5-year actuarial overall survival (52% v 79%) showed no statistically significant differences in prognosis between B- and T-cell patients, respectively. The 5-year actuarial survival of patients with stage IV T-cell DLCL (56%) also did not differ in a statistically significant way from stage IV B-cell patients (36%). We conclude that treatment selection for DLCL should not be based on immunologic phenotype alone. 
Long survival after excision of a primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus. A woman who had a large primary malignant melanoma of the oesophagus, with evidence of submucosal invasion and several local metastases, underwent resection two years after the onset of retrosternal pain and has survived for 12 years with no recurrence. 
Beta-adrenergic-antagonist drugs in the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices. An analysis of data and prognostic factors in 589 patients from four randomized clinical trials. Franco-Italian Multicenter Study Group. BACKGROUND. The value of beta-adrenergic-antagonist drug therapy for the prevention of initial episodes of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis and esophageal varices is uncertain, both positive and negative study results having been reported. METHODS. In this study, we analyzed data on individual patients from four randomized, controlled trials to assess the efficacy of this treatment. Of the 589 patients studied, 286 received a beta-adrenergic-antagonist drug (propranolol in 203 and nadolol in 83) and 303 received placebo. RESULTS. After two years, the mean (+/- SE) percentage of patients who had had no upper gastrointestinal bleeding was 78 +/- 3 percent in the beta-adrenergic-antagonist treatment group and 65 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.002). The percentage of patients without fatal bleeding was 90 +/- 2 percent in the treatment group and 82 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.01). The percentage of patients surviving after two years was 71 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 68 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.34). After age and severity of cirrhosis were taken into account, the survival rate was better in the treatment group (P = 0.09). The percentage of surviving patients who had had no bleeding after two years was 62 +/- 3 percent in the treatment group and 53 +/- 3 percent in the control group (P = 0.04). Both propranolol and nadolol prevented a first episode of bleeding. Severe cirrhosis and especially the presence of ascites were associated with bleeding (P less than 0.001) and death (P less than 0.001) in both groups. The efficacy of beta-adrenergic-antagonist therapy in the prevention of bleeding (P less than 0.001) and of fatal bleeding (P = 0.004) and in the prevention of bleeding or death (P = 0.005) was the same after adjustment for cause and severity of cirrhosis, ascites, and size of varices. CONCLUSIONS. Propranolol and nadolol are effective in preventing first bleeding and reducing the mortality rate associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis, regardless of severity. 
Glomerulopathy in patient with Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate renal structure in a child with Donohue syndrome (leprechaunism), who at 10 yr of age was noted to have hypertension, microalbuminuria, and enlarged kidneys, a renal biopsy was performed. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The renal biopsy tissue was evaluated by light and electron microscopy with standard stereological techniques to measure glomerular volume, glomerular basement membrane width, fractional mesangial volume, and peripheral capillary filtering surface density. RESULTS: On renal biopsy, there was a marked increase in glomerular volume, glomerular basement width, and mesangial volume, findings similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. CONCLUSIONS: This patient with marked insulin resistance associated with Donohue syndrome demonstrates renal and glomerular enlargement and morphometric glomerular changes similar to those seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In unusual syndromes with hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, renal structural and functional changes typical of traditional diabetes mellitus may be seen. 
The measurement and manipulation of intralabyrinthine pressure in experimental endolymphatic hydrops. Three to four months after unilateral surgical ablation of the endolymphatic duct and sac, endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressures were measured in both the normal and hydropic ears of 11 guinea pigs. In normal ears, endolymphatic pressure always approximated perilymphatic pressure. Endolymphatic pressure exceeded perilymphatic pressure in all ears with hydrops, except one in which these pressures were equal. The effect of postural inversion on inner ear pressures were studied in both normal and hydropic inner ears. Normal ears showed endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressure to rise equally during this maneuver. In hydropic ears, the difference between endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressure was notably reduced from measurements obtained in the prone position. This study indicates that an alteration in pressure regulation within the inner ear may be important in the pathogenesis and manifestation of experimental endolymphatic hydrops in the guinea pig. Physiologic mechanisms and clinical implications of these results are described. 
Prosthetic replacement of the distal femur for primary bone tumours. Over a 16-year period, 135 custom-made distal femoral prostheses, based on a fully constrained Stanmore-type knee replacement, were used in the treatment of primary malignant or aggressive benign tumours. Survivorship analysis showed a cumulative success rate of 72% at five years and 64% at seven years. Intact prostheses in 91% of the surviving patients gave good or excellent functional results. Deep infection was the major complication, occurring in 6.8% of cases; clinical aseptic loosening occurred in 6.0%. Revision surgery was carried out for loosening and infection, and the early results are encouraging. We conclude that prosthetic replacement of the distal femur can meet the objectives of limb salvage surgery. 
The neurology of endemic cretinism. A study of two endemias. Endemic cretinism is the most severe manifestation of dietary iodine deficiency. Two forms of the syndrome are traditionally described: neurological and myxoedematous. Although this classification highlights the important neurological sequelae of the disorder it implies that myxoedematous cretins have an alternative mechanism. Further, the nature of the neurological deficit associated with both types of endemic cretinism has received scant attention in recent times considering that it remains a common disorder in many parts of the world. The nature and extent of the neurological deficit found in endemic cretinism was investigated in 104 cretins from a predominantly myxoedematous endemia in western China and in 35 cretins from central Java, Indonesia, a predominantly neurological endemia. We found a similar pattern of neurological involvement in nearly all cretins from both endemias, regardless of type (myxoedematous or neurological), and of current thyroid function. Hallmarks of the neurological features included mental retardation, pyramidal signs in a proximal distribution and extrapyramidal signs. Many patients exhibited a characteristic gait. This probably reflected pyramidal and extrapyramidal dysfunction, although joint laxity and deformity were important contributing factors. Other frequently encountered clinical features were squint, deafness, and primitive reflexes. Cerebral computerized tomography (CT) revealed basal ganglia calcification in 15 of 50 subjects. The presence of basal ganglia calcification was confined to cretins with severe hypothyroidism. Otherwise, cerebral CT scanning demonstrated only minor abnormalities which did not contribute to the localization of the clinical deficits. We conclude that the same neurological disorder is present in both types of endemic cretinism reflecting a diffuse insult to the developing fetal nervous system. These clinical findings support the concept of maternal and fetal hypothyroxinaemia, arising from severe iodine deficiency, as the primary pathophysiological event in endemic cretinism. Differences between the two types of cretinism may be explained by continuing postnatal thyroid hormone deficiency in the myxoedematous type, which results in impaired growth, skeletal retardation and sexual immaturity. 
Pulmonary vein thrombosis following bilobectomy. Acute thrombosis of the pulmonary vein following lobectomy or bilobectomy is a rare complication with no standard guideline for diagnosis or management. In this report, we present a case of right upper lobe vein thrombosis following a middle and lower lobectomy. Diagnosis was confirmed by ventilation-perfusion lung scan, pulmonary angiogram, and bronchoscopy. The patient was treated conservatively with no further complications and had a partial recovery of the circulation to the right upper lobe. A review of the literature is also presented along with the experimental data demonstrating the mechanisms of recovery. 
Atypical squamous cells. A case-series study of the association between papanicolaou smear results and human papillomavirus DNA genotype. Thirty women with "atypical" squamous cells but not cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) on their Papanicolaou smears were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) with the Southern blot hybridization technique. The Papanicolaou smears were reviewed for the presence of atypical squamous cells according to Patten's criteria. Comparison groups consisted of 30 patients with normal, 29 patients with CIN I and 24 patients with CIN II Papanicolaou smears. Ten of the 30 women (33%) with atypical cells on Papanicolaou smears were positive for HPV DNA as compared to 17% with normal and 59% with CIN I or II Papanicolaou smears. HPV 16 was present in 70-80% of the HPV DNA-positive patients in each Papanicolaou smear group. Concurrent CIN was also identified on colposcopically directed biopsies in 27% of the patients with squamous atypia. Patients with atypical squamous cells on Papanicolaou smears had coexisting HPV infection and CIN in about one-third of the cases. Colposcopy and further follow-up are recommended for such patients. 
Injury current and gradients of diastolic stimulation threshold, TQ potential, and extracellular potassium concentration during acute regional ischemia in the isolated perfused pig heart. During acute regional myocardial ischemia, a "current of injury" flows between the ischemic and the normal tissue. Its direction and magnitude change during the cardiac cycle. During diastole, the injury current flows intracellularly from the ischemic cells toward the normal cells and tends to depolarize the latter. The gain insight into the possible role of the injury current in arrhythmogenesis, we simultaneously determined diastolic stimulation threshold, [K+]o and TQ potential at multiple sites closely spaced across the cyanotic border in Langendorff-perfused pig hearts during the first 10 minutes after occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The position of the electrodes relative to the border was validated by their response to 1) regional ischemia and 2) selective perfusion with a high-K+ perfusate of the left anterior descending coronary artery. A temporary decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold preceded a rapid increase in the central ischemic zone; a lasting reduction (by +/- 20%) without a concomitant increase of [K+]o was observed at seven sites (of 39 sites tested), five of which were less than 2 mm outside the electrophysiological border. Moreover, up to 4 mm inside the electrophysiological border, a similar lasting decrease of diastolic stimulation threshold was accompanied by a moderate increase of [K+]o. We conclude that 1) the injury current causes increased excitability in normal tissue close to the "ischemic" border and 2) increased excitability related to a moderately increased [K+]o may persist up to 10 minutes of ischemia at the ischemic side of the border. Both factors may facilitate the induction of life-threatening arrhythmias in acute myocardial ischemia. 
Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring: prognostic aspects during acoustic tumor removal. Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring with electrical stimulation (IFNMES) has become an integral part of acoustic tumor surgery. We reviewed the records of fifty-six patients who underwent translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removal with IFNMES. There was excellent correlation between intraoperative facial nerve activity and immediate postoperative facial nerve function (24 hours after surgery and at hospital discharge). Our data would suggest that patients who exhibit less than 500 microvolts of ongoing EMG activity during surgery, and who yield at least a 500-microvolt contraction when stimulated with 0.05 milliamps at the brainstem after tumor removal, can expect an excellent immediate facial nerve result (grade I or II). 
Diskitis in children. Thirty-six patients diagnosed with diskitis from 1978 to 1988 and followed for an average of 29.2 months were reviewed. The study included 23 boys and 13 girls with an average age of 5.3 years. The initial symptoms varied, but distinct clinical patterns emerged and were identifiable in different age groups. Both the leukocyte count and sedimentation rate were elevated. Routine roentgenograms were positive for intervertebral disk space narrowing in 82% of cases, technetium bone scans positive in 72%, and magnetic resonance imaging positive in all recent cases. Treatment consisted of bed rest for all patients, plaster casts for 50%, antibiotics for 40%, and traction for 23%. Regardless of the treatment combination, the course of the disease in most children is benign. At the completion of the study, all patients were asymptomatic including three children who had recurrences. In spite of being asymptomatic, 74% had persistent roentgenographic changes. The administration of antibiotics appears to be appropriate when indicated, i.e., failure to respond to immobilization. Disk space aspiration or biopsy should be reserved for those cases that are refractory to immobilization and antibiotics. 
The autotransfusion effect of external leg counterpressure in simulated mild hypovolemia. We examined the cardiovascular response of external leg counterpressure in healthy volunteers at 100 mm Hg compression pressure. To stimulate mild hypovolemia, measurements were made with the subjects in a 60 degrees head-up tilt position. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and cardiac output (CO) were calculated from two-dimensional echocardiography. Flow through the inferior vena cava (IVC) below the origin of the hepatic veins was determined by the Doppler ultrasound technique. The application of counterpressure significantly increased LVEDV, CO, and arterial blood pressure over that seen with tilting without the device. These responses were accompanied by a small but significant increase in IVC flow. We therefore concluded that external leg counterpressure transferred blood to the central circulation by compression of the venous capacitance vessels (an autotransfusion effect) in mild hypovolemia, but such an effect may not benefit patients in a hypovolemic shock state because of the small amount of translocated blood. 
Cardiovascular reflexes and autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Cardiovascular reflexes were analysed in a group of 20 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and in 12 age-matched healthy subjects, in order to ascertain the incidence and degree of autonomic dysfunction. The following were measured: heart rate variation during normal breathing, postural change (30/15 ratio) and during the Valsalva manoeuvre: blood pressure variation after standing. These measurements were taken at least 12 h after therapy had been withdrawn and were repeated after therapy had been resumed. Significant changes in the different heart rate variation indices were found in the parkinsonian patients which correlated with the duration and severity of the extrapyramidal symptomatology. After standing the patients showed a significant drop in blood pressure, when compared respectively with their base values and with the response in controls. Anticholinergic drugs had no significant effect on the heart rate variation indices, whereas antiparkinsonian therapy seems to have contributed to the drop in blood pressure after standing. 
Dysfibrinogenemia associated with thrombosis and third-trimester fetal loss. A case report. Dysfibrinogenemias are rare genetic disorders that are clinically silent, cause a mild bleeding tendency or have thromboembolic manifestations. During pregnancy they often cause hemorrhage and first-trimester abortions. A patient with a severe thrombotic tendency during pregnancy had a third-trimester fetal loss. 
Comparative effects of APSAC and rt-PA on infarct size and left ventricular function in acute myocardial infarction. A multicenter randomized study. BACKGROUND. Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA or alteplase) and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (APSAC or anistreplase) have been demonstrated to limit infarct size significantly and to preserve left ventricular function when injected soon after acute myocardial infarction. However, as yet, the efficacy and safety of these two thrombolytic agents have not been directly compared in one trial; this was the aim of this study. METHODS AND RESULTS. One hundred eighty-three patients suffering from a first acute myocardial infarction were randomly allocated to either APSAC (30 units over 5 minutes) or single-chain rt-PA (100 mg over a 3-hour period) within 4 hours of the onset of symptoms. Global and regional left ventricular function were assessed from contrast angiography an average of 5.3 +/- 2.3 days after initial therapy. Radionuclide angiography and thallium-201 single-photon emission computerized tomography were performed before hospital discharge. Infarct size was assessed by single-photon emission computerized tomography and expressed in percentage of the total myocardial volume. Ninety patients received APSAC and 93 received rt-PA within a mean period of 172 +/- 52 minutes after the onset of symptoms. The two groups were similar in age, location of the acute myocardial infarction, Killip class, and time of randomization. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery was 72% in the APSAC group and 76% in the rt-PA group (NS). Initial and predischarge left ventricular ejection fraction as well as infarct size were similar in both therapeutic groups (0.50 +/- 0.14 versus 0.52 +/- 0.12 for initial and 0.48 +/- 0.10 versus 0.47 +/- 0.10 for predischarge ejection fraction, 11 +/- 7% versus 9 +/- 7% for infarct size, respectively, for APSAC- and rt-PA-treated patients). Bleeding complications requiring blood transfusion occurred in one APSAC patient and in two rt-PA patients. One patient in the rt-PA group died of a massive intracranial hemorrhage. At the end of the 3-week follow-up period, five APSAC patients (5.5%) and seven rt-PA patients (7.5%) had died. CONCLUSIONS. The early infusion of APSAC or rt-PA in acute myocardial infarction produced a similar patency rate, limitation of infarct size, and preservation of left ventricular systolic function with an equivalent rate of bleeding complications. 
Detection of field change in oral cancer using oral exfoliative cytologic study. Four smears were taken from the normal buccal mucosa of 55 oral cancer patients and 76 cancer-free patients. In each case, two were stained by the Papanicolaou method and two underwent Feulgen hydrolysis. Quantitative assessment of nuclear area (NA) and cytoplasmic area (CA) of the Papanicolaou smears was undertaken using a semiautomatic image analysis system. DNA profiles were assessed from the Feulgen smears using a Vickers M85 microdensitometer (Vickers Instruments, York, England) and were found to be diploid for all patients. Results were then analyzed with respect to those patients who took alcohol, tobacco, combination of alcohol and tobacco, and those who took neither. A significant reduction in CA for the oral cancer group (P equals 0.001) but no change in NA (P equals 0.74) was observed. A detailed analysis of alcohol and tobacco habits could identify no significant role for these two factors, in the reduction in cytoplasmic area. Such field change may prove to be of value in predicting the development of second malignant tumors. 
Fever: knowledge, perception and attitudes. Results from a Norwegian population study. To investigate the layman's knowledge, perception and attitudes regarding normal body temperature, fever, infections and the effect of penicillin on virus infections a representative sample of the Norwegian population (619 women and 592 men over the age of 15) was interviewed in 1988 as part of a monthly national opinion poll. One-third thought body temperatures up to 40.5 degrees C to be life-threatening, but the results do not justify the application of the term 'fever phobia' as described in other studies based on non-representative samples. More respondents were afraid of viral infections (48%) than bacterial infections (9%), which may be due to the media focus upon the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Thirty-five per cent believed penicillin to be effective against virus infections. Educational programmes on fever should also include information about virus infections and their treatment. 
Assessment of response to cancer therapy using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography. In order to evaluate the usefulness of 18F-FDG PET in the assessment of therapeutic effects, FDG-PET studies were performed both before and after therapy in 26 patients with miscellaneous malignant tumors. The change in FDG uptake by therapy was compared with the change in tumor size and prognosis. All 26 lesions had a high FDG uptake before therapy. Five of seven lesions which had a relatively low FDG uptake before therapy showed no change or increase in tumor size by therapy. The decreased FDG uptake after therapy was more prominent in the partial response group than in the no change group. FDG uptake before therapy in the non-relapse group was higher than that in the relapse group. However, a decreased FDG uptake did not necessarily indicate a good prognosis. One patient with no change in tumor size and a decreased FDG uptake had no recurrence. This suggests that FDG-PET has a complementary role in the assessment of therapeutic effects. 
Subarachnoid hemorrhage from multiple neurofibromas of the cauda equina: case report. The authors report a case of spinal subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by neurofibromas of the cauda equina. An examination of the literature revealing 13 similar cases and an analysis of this case showing three neurofibromas of the cauda equina prompted an hypothesis emphasizing the origin of bleeding and the difficulties associated with a correct diagnosis. 
Differential effect of compression-ischaemia block on warm sensation and heat-induced pain. The effect of compression-ischaemia nerve block on psychophysical thresholds for warm sensation and heat-induced pain was studied on 19 normal human volunteers. Although those two sensory submodalities should be predicted to block simultaneously, based on the fact that both are served by unmyelinated primary afferents, it was actually found that warm sensation was much more vulnerable to compression-ischaemia than heat-induced pain. This is interpreted as resulting from different summation requirements for each of the two sensory modalities; sensation of warmth depends on spatial summation to a larger extent than heat-induced pain. Such differential vulnerability is in line with recent clinical studies reporting deterioration of warm sensation associated with preservation of heat pain in peripheral nerve disorders caused by diabetes, ageing and other neuropathic processes. 
Acoustic schwannomas in children. The clinical presentation and treatment of three cases of acoustic schwannoma occurring in children are described. All the tumors were detected late, when they had attained a large size and were extremely vascular. The use of preoperative tumor embolization as an adjunct to surgical excision is discussed. 
Hepatofugal arterial signal in the main portal vein: an indicator of intravascular tumor spread. Five patients with thrombosis of the main portal vein underwent Doppler ultrasound (US). Three of these patients had confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma. Doppler US allowed differentiation between bland thrombus and tumor thrombus in two of the three patients. Tumor thrombus of the main portal vein was characterized at US by an intraportal arterial waveform in a hepatofugal direction. 
Differentiation of hydrocephalic calf and human calvariae. Occasionally, partial calvariae of hydrocephalic calves are found in forensic contexts and mistakenly identified as human. Such specimens can be properly identified through immunological assessment of associated soft tissue, microscopic analysis of associated hair, and morphological comparison with documented museum specimens. Morphological comparison should focus on the form of the occiput, supraorbital grooves, and bulbous vault and presence of coronal processes. 
Risk factors for infusion-related phlebitis with small peripheral venous catheters. A randomized controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: To identify risk factors for infusion-related phlebitis with peripheral intravenous catheters. DESIGN: A randomized trial of two catheter materials, with consideration of 21 potential risk factors. SETTING: A university hospital. PATIENTS: Hospitalized adults without granulocytopenia who received a peripheral intravenous catheter. INTERVENTIONS: House officers or ward nurses inserted the catheters, and each insertion was randomized to a catheter made of tetrafluoroethylene-hexafluoropropylene (FEP-Teflon) or a novel polyetherurethane without leachable additives (PEU-Vialon). MEASUREMENTS: Research nurses scored insertion sites each day for inflammation and cultured catheters at removal. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier risk for phlebitis exceeded 50% by day 4 after catheterization. intravenous antibiotics (relative risk, 2.00), female sex (relative risk, 1.88), prolonged (greater than 48 hours) catheterization (relative risk, 1.79), and catheter material (PEU-Vialon: FEP-Teflon) (relative risk, 0.73) strongly predicted phlebitis in a Cox proportional hazards model (each, P less than 0.003). The best-fit model for severe phlebitis identified the same predictors plus catheter-related infection (relative risk, 6.19), phlebitis with a previous catheter (relative risk, 1.54), and anatomic site (hand: forearm, relative risk, 0.71; wrist:forearm, relative risk, 0.60). The low incidence of local catheter-related infection was comparable with the two catheter materials (5.4% [95% CI, 3.8% to 7.6%] and 6.9% [CI, 4.9% to 9.6%]); none of the 1054 catheters prospectively studied caused bacteremia. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors, including the infusate and the duration of cannulation, contribute to the development of infusion-related phlebitis. The use of peripheral intravenous catheters made of PEU-Vialon appears to pose the same risk for catheter-related infection as the use of catheters made of FEP-Teflon, and PEU-Vialon can permit longer cannulation with less risk for phlebitis. The risk for catheter-related bacteremia with FEP-Teflon and PEU-Vialon catheters is sufficiently low that it no longer seems justifiable to recommend the use of small steel needles for most peripheral intravenous therapy. 
Surgical depilation for the treatment of pseudofolliculitis or local hirsutism of the face: experience in the first 40 patients. Forty patients underwent surgical depilation for pseudofolliculitis barbae or local hirsutism of the face during a 15-year period. The operative method and its results and pitfalls are discussed. Although it is not the treatment of choice, this operation is very useful when other therapy has not been successful. This seems especially true in male-to-female transsexuals. 
Muscle structure and performance capacity of Himalayan Sherpas. The ultrastructure of the vastus lateralis muscle of Sherpas from Nepal [5 males; age 28 +/- 2.8 (SD) yr, indirect maximal O2 consumption 48.5 +/- 5.4 ml.kg(-1).min(-1)] was assessed and compared with those of sedentary lowlanders and of Caucasian climbers before and after high-altitude exposure. The mean cross-sectional area of the fibers was 3,186 +/- 521 microns2, i.e., similar to those of Caucasian elite high-altitude climbers (3,108 +/- 303 microns2) and a group of climbers after a 6- to 8-wk sojourn at 5,000-8,600 m (3,360 +/- 580 microns2) but significantly (P less than 0.05) smaller than that of unacclimatized climbers (4,170 +/- 710 microns2) and slightly, although not significantly, lower than that of sedentary lowlanders (3,640 +/- 260 microns2). The number of capillaries per square millimeter of muscle cross section was 467 +/- 22, not significantly smaller than those of climbers on return from a Himalayan expedition (538 +/- 89) and elite high-altitude climbers (542 +/- 127) but significantly (P less than 0.05) greater than that of sedentary lowlanders (387 +/- 25). The volume density of mitochondria was 3.96 +/- 0.54%, significantly (P less than 0.05) less than the values found for any other investigated group, including sedentary subjects at sea level (4.74 +/- 0.30%). It is concluded that Sherpas, like acclimatized Caucasian climbers, are characterized by 1) facilitated convective and diffusive muscle O2 flow conditions and 2) a higher maximal O2 consumption-to-mitochondrial volume ratio than lowlanders despite a reduced mitochondrial volume density. 
Test-retest reliability of isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque measurements in persons with spastic hemiparesis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the test-retest reliability of isokinetic torque measurements in the involved and uninvolved knee musculature of 20 subjects with spastic hemiparesis. An isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure maximal voluntary knee extension and flexion at 60 degrees and 120 degrees/s. Peak torque (PT) and average peak torque (APT) data were collected from five repetitions on two separate occasions. Average peak torque was defined as the mean of the PT values obtained during each of the five repetitions. Spasticity was measured in the involved knee musculature prior to isokinetic testing using the Ashworth Scale. Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were high (greater than or equal to .90) for both knees for PT and APT at both angular velocities. No clinically meaningful differences were found between the Pearson correlation coefficients and the ICCs of the involved versus the uninvolved knee for any testing conditions. We concluded that isokinetic evaluation of torque, as measured by PT and APT in subjects with spastic hemiparesis, can yield reliable results in both extremities. 
Thrombogenic microballoon for cerebral aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and carotid cavernous fistula occlusion. Preliminary technical note. A thrombogenic microballoon was developed to overcome the problems of cerebral aneurysm rupture during microballoon inflation and incomplete aneurysm obliteration by microballoons with subsequent fatal rupture. These complications occur in about 35% of reported series with current microballoon embolization techniques. The wall of the new thrombogenic microballoon allows 80% aneurysm occlusion by inflation, thus avoiding mechanical rupture, and at the same time it produces a blood clot in the space remaining between the microballoon and the aneurysm wall. This clot undergoes fibrosis with firm adherence of the microballoon to the aneurysm wall. Experimental evidence is presented to support these conclusions. This thrombogenic microballoon system is also applicable to carotid-cavernous fistulas and arteriovenous malformations. 
Resternotomy in patients with valved conduits adherent to the sternum. Twenty-two patients with valved conduits adherent to the sternum underwent resternotomy. Mean age was 10 +/- 6 years, and mean conduit age was 4 +/- 4 years. Diagnoses were D-transposition (7), truncus arteriosus (7), univentricular heart (6), Taussig-Bing anomaly (1), and corrected transposition (1). The majority of patients (68%) had reoperation for outgrown or degenerated conduits. In 17 patients, the sternum was opened with a chisel. Two of these patients sustained conduit neointimal collapse from manipulation, and 3 had conduit tear requiring immediate cardiopulmonary bypass through the femoral vessels. In the last 5 patients, the sternum was opened above and below the conduit, and the inner table was chiseled and left attached to the conduit avoiding injury and undue conduit manipulation. Cardiopulmonary bypass and operation were carried out uneventfully. We believe that the recent technique described provides a safe alternative approach to valved conduits adherent to the sternum. 
Dynamic QRS-complex and ST-segment monitoring in acute myocardial infarction during recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy. The TEAHAT Study Group. Changes of the QRS complex are the electrocardiographic expression of irreversible injury of the myocardium. In humans, the process of infarction occurs over several hours. A more rapid development of QRS changes has been reported in patients treated with thrombolytic agents. Patients with strongly suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI) included in a placebo-controlled trial of 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) were monitored for 24 hours with continuous, on-line vectorcardiography. The magnitude of the QRS vector changes correlated with infarct size estimated by the maximal value of lactate dehydrogenase-1 (r = 0.69, p less than 0.001) as well as with left ventricular ejection fraction 30 days after randomization (r = 0.49, p less than 0.001). Treatment with intravenous rt-PA limited total QRS vector change but the QRS vector changes observed occurred more rapidly and reached a plateau 131 minutes earlier in patients treated with rt-PA than in those receiving placebo (p less than 0.01). A certain pattern of highly variable ST vector magnitude was identified and was associated with higher maximal lactate dehydrogenase-1 values (23 +/- 13 vs 14 +/- 10 mu kat/liter, p less than 0.001) and a tendency to higher 1-year mortality (24 vs 9%, p = 0.08) than in patients without this pattern. In patients with this pattern, rt-PA did not affect maximal lactate dehydrogenase-1, time to maximal creatine kinase and final magnitude of QRS vector change. 
Peripheral pulse pressure patterns in pregnancy hypertension. Maternal heart rate and pulse pressure patterns were examined in 30 hypertensive pregnant women using noninvasive methodology described previously. "Narrow" and "wide" pulse patterns were identified. Narrow cutaneous pulse pressure patterns, which are thought to be caused by vasoconstriction, were associated with lower birth weight infants (1870 +/- 983 versus 3225 +/- 838 g; P less than .001) and earlier deliveries (34.2 +/- 5.2 versus 37.9 +/- 2.8 weeks; P less than .05). The data suggest that these adjunctive maternal cardiovascular-system evaluation techniques may be useful in identifying patients at risk of adverse perinatal outcome by detecting vasospasm of the peripheral microcirculation. 
Detection of paradoxical cerebral echo contrast embolization by transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Contrast echocardiography has been shown to be a sensitive method for detecting patent foramen ovale in embolic stroke, implying paradoxical embolization. However, not all two-dimensional echocardiographic studies are of diagnostic quality, and direct evidence for paradoxical cerebral embolization remains lacking. We addressed these problems by simultaneously using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and contrast echocardiography to compare relative sensitivity and concordance in the detection of right-to-left vascular shunting. Forty-six patients with stroke, transient neurologic defect, or question of atrial septal defect underwent study at rest and during Valsalva strain. Two-dimensional echocardiography detected shunting in 26% at rest and 15% during Valsalva strain, whereas transcranial Doppler study returned rates of 41% and 41%, respectively. Concordance was 82% and 75%, respectively. Discordant studies almost always had evidence of paradoxical contrast embolization by transcranial Doppler and intermediate findings by two-dimensional echocardiography. Transcranial Doppler is a sensitive, unambiguous technique for the detection of anatomic substrates and target organ involvement in patients suspected to have paradoxical cerebral embolization. 
Effect of intrathecal fibrinolytic therapy on clot lysis and vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. A prospective series of 30 patients with a single, angiographically verified aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was studied for the effect of intrathecal thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on outcome, angiographic vasospasm, and computerized tomography (CT) findings after surgery. The patients included fulfilled the following criteria: operation was performed by Day 3 after the hemorrhage, CT showed only blood in the basal cisterns, and the patient had a single aneurysm or multiple aneurysms that could be treated surgically at the same operation. The patients were divided into groups of 10, with patients receiving 3, 10, or 13 mg of rt-PA in a single intracisternal injection at the end of the operation. There were no differences between the treatment groups in overall outcome. One patient from the 3-mg rt-PA group developed a postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage, and one patient from the 10-mg rt-PA group had a postoperative epidural hematoma. There was one death in the 13-mg rt-PA group that was caused by inclusion of a segment of pericallosal artery in the clip. In all treatment groups a reduction was observed in the amount of blood seen on the postoperative CT scans compared to the preoperative CT scans. The reduction in SAH grade between the 10-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was significant (p less than 0.05). The difference in the severity of angiographic vasospasm between the 3-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was also significant (p less than 0.05). 
Intraoperative electron beam radiation therapy for retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma. From December 1981 to December 1989, 20 patients with primary or recurrent retroperitoneal sarcoma received 4000 to 5000 cGy of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in conjunction with surgical resection and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Seventeen of 20 patients underwent complete (14 patients) or partial (3 patients) resection. Three patients had shown evidence of metastases after EBRT by the time of surgery. The 4-year actuarial local control and disease-free survival rates of the 17 patients undergoing resection were 81% and 64%, respectively. Twelve patients received IORT at the time of resection for microscopic disease (10 patients) or gross residual sarcoma (2 patients). Of the ten patients receiving IORT for microscopic tumor, one patient has died of local failure and peritoneal sarcomatosis and two patients have died of distant metastases only. The remaining seven patients are disease-free. One patient treated for gross residual sarcoma has experienced a local failure 1 year after IORT and is without disease 7 years after salvage chemotherapy. The other patient treated for gross residual sarcoma has died of local failure. Five patients did not receive IORT at the time of resection because of the extensive size of the tumor bed. Three of these patients are disease-free with one patient alive with lung metastases and one patient dying of hepatic metastases. Aggressive radiation and surgical procedures appear to provide satisfactory resectability and local control with acceptable tolerance. 
Meningioma: the role of a foreign body and irradiation in tumor formation. A case of meningioma is reported. At the age of 18 years, the patient had undergone insertion of a Torkildsen shunt through a posteroparietal burr hole for obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a tumor of the pineal region, of which no biopsy had been made. After the hydrocephalus was relieved, he underwent irradiation of the tumor. Thirty years later, he was treated for an intracranial meningioma wrapped around the shunt. The tumor followed the shunt in all of its intracranial course. Microscopy disclosed pieces of the shunt tube within the meningioma. The role of a foreign body and irradiation in the induction of meningiomas is discussed, and a comprehensive review of the literature is presented. 
Quantitation of the critically ischemic zone at risk during acute coronary occlusion using PET. Critical myocardial ischemia has been defined experimentally during acute coronary occlusion as flow reduction of 50% or more since cellular ATP depletion begins to occur beyond this flow reduction threshold, placing tissue at risk of cellular injury. To test the hypothesis that critically ischemic fractional left ventricular mass can be measured noninvasively with PET, nine dogs were imaged in a multi-slice positron camera using the perfusion tracer 13N-ammonia, while radiolabeled microspheres were injected into the left atrium during acute coronary occlusion. Images were processed using a 50% threshold and the size of the resulting perfusion defect was expressed as a fraction of total left ventricular image volume. The critically ischemic left ventricular fraction determined in vitro from the microsphere perfusion data, ranged from 5% to 30% of the total left ventricular weight and correlated closely with that determined noninvasively by PET with r = 0.94 (y = 1.05X - 2.0%). We conclude that the fraction of left ventricular myocardium rendered critically ischemic during acute coronary occlusion can be measured accurately and noninvasively in vivo using perfusion imaging with positron emission tomography. 
Progressive deterioration of auditory evoked potentials after excision of an acoustic neurinoma: case report. The authors report the case of a 17-year-old girl who underwent excision of bilateral neurinomas of the cerebellopontine angle. Although her auditory evoked potentials were well maintained during the operation, they deteriorated gradually and progressively for the following 2 months. This seemed to reflect degeneration of the cochlear nerve fibers initiated by operative manipulation in the cerebellopontine angle in a patient who had no hearing when she awoke from surgery. 
Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. Diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage is a syndrome consisting of hemoptysis, anemia, and air-space consolidation. The radiologic appearance is non-specific. Pulmonary hemorrhage may be due to a number of different causes. The differential diagnosis and the diagnostic approach are different in the immunologically intact host as compared with the immunocompromised host. This article reviews the main diagnostic considerations in diffuse pulmonary hemorrhage. 
Gonococcal endocarditis complicating pregnancy: a case report and literature review. The incidence of gonorrhea has decreased substantially in the past decade. Disseminated gonorrhea is more common in women than in men, although gonococcal endocarditis is more common in men. Disseminated gonorrhea is most commonly described in women during menses or pregnancy. Only two cases of gonococcal endocarditis during pregnancy have been reported in the literature since 1942. We report a patient who experienced sudden hemodynamic decompensation at 30 weeks' gestation, resulting in fetal death. Aortic valve replacement was performed, but extensive involvement of the aortic root made complete eradication of infection impossible and eventually resulted in maternal death. 
Biomechanical changes at the ankle joint after stroke. The resistance of the relaxed ankle to slow displacement over the joint movement range was measured on both sides of a group of hemiparetic stroke patients, in whom spasticity had been established for at least one year and who showed no clinical signs of contractures. The ankle joints of the age-matched normal subjects were flexible over most of the movement range, showing dramatically increasing stiffness only when the foot was dorsiflexed beyond 70 degrees, with a neutral range between 90-100 degrees, and a less dramatic increase in stiffness during plantarflexion. Hemiparetic patients showed identical curves to the normal subjects on the "healthy" side, ipsilateral to the causative cerebral lesion, but were significantly stiffer in dorsiflexion on the contralateral side, without change in the minimum stiffness range or during plantarflexion. Therefore significant changes in passive biomechanical properties occur at the affected ankle of hemiparetic subjects, predominantly as the result of a loss of compliance in the Achilles tendon, although an increase in the passive stiffness of the triceps surae may also occur. The contribution of these changes to the locomotor disability of hemiparetic patients is discussed. 
Multichannel cochlear implant and electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses in a child with labyrinthitis ossificans. Ossification of the cochlea following meningitis presents a surgical challenge. Electrode mapping, especially in the young child, is difficult given the uncertainty of electrode contact with viable neural elements. This paper reviews surgical technique and the use of auditory brainstem responses to map the electrodes. A 4-year-old child deafened by meningitis at age 20 months had bilateral cochlear ossification by computed tomography. At surgery, a canal wall-down mastoidectomy and closure of the ear canal were performed. A trough around the modiolus was drilled, and the electrode array was placed in it. Post-operatively, the patient gave aversive or no responses to electrode stimulation. To assess electrode function, auditory brainstem responses to individual electrode activation were obtained under general anesthesia. Functioning electrodes could thus be selected for mapping. The patient now responds well to sound. 
Left ventricular diastolic collapse. An echocardiographic sign of regional cardiac tamponade. BACKGROUND. Cardiac tamponade after cardiac surgical procedures is often associated with hemodynamically significant localized pericardial effusions. The localized collection of pericardial effusion in the postoperative period and the atypical presentation of cardiac tamponade limit the use of conventional clinical and echocardiographic signs usually seen with a circumferential pericardial effusion. Observation of left ventricular diastolic collapse in the echocardiogram of a patient with postoperative regional cardiac tamponade prompted us to explore the frequency of this sign in regional cardiac tamponade. METHODS AND RESULTS. We retrospectively analyzed the echocardiograms of 18 patients with postoperative cardiac tamponade for the following echocardiographic findings: right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, left atrial collapse, and left ventricular diastolic collapse. Three of the 18 patients had circumferential pericardial effusion, and 15 had loculated pericardial effusion; in 10, the effusion was predominantly posterior, and in the other five, it extended laterally or inferiorly. The conventional echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade such as right atrial collapse, right ventricular diastolic collapse, and left atrial collapse were present in only 3, 1, and 3 of these 15 patients, respectively, but all exhibited left ventricular diastolic collapse. Increasing pressure within the compartment of a loculated pericardial effusion reaching the limit of pericardial distensibility and consequent transient reversal of transmural left ventricular pressure during diastole are most likely the basis for diastolic collapse of the thick-walled ventricle in a setting of regional cardiac tamponade. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that left ventricular diastolic collapse is a frequent sign of regional cardiac tamponade and could be a useful marker of tamponade in postoperative patients. 
Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of stenotic standard Blalock-Taussig shunts: effect on choice of initial palliation in cyanotic congenital heart disease. To date, attempted balloon dilation of stenotic standard Blalock-Taussig shunts has been largely disappointing. It has been suggested that this may be due to the use of balloons of insufficient diameter. Balloon dilation of stenotic Blalock-Taussig shunts was attempted with use of relatively large balloons in five patients (11 to 67 months old) with cyanotic heart disease who were becoming progressively cyanotic and polycythemic (hemoglobin 17.9 +/- 1.1 g/dl) because of discrete shunt stenosis at the site of pulmonary anastomosis. Balloon diameters selected were equal to or within 1 mm of the unobstructed proximal shunt diameter. Before balloon dilation the diameter at the site of the stenosis was 2.8 +/- 0.8 mm (range 1.7 to 4); after balloon dilation it was 5.7 +/- 1.1 mm (range 4.5 to 7.5). The diameter increased in all patients (range 2.0 to 3.5 mm); the mean increase was 2.8 +/- 0.2 mm (p less than 0.005). Expressed as a percent, the increase in diameter at the stenosis ranged from 80% to 182.4% (mean 108.2 +/- 16.8%). Before balloon dilation the systemic oxygen saturation was 72.8 +/- 9.2% (range 55% to 80%) and after balloon dilation it was 83.6 +/- 2.9% (range 80% to 87%). A satisfactory increase (range 6% to 25%) in blood oxygen saturation was seen in all patients; the mean increase was 10.8 +/- 3.2% (p less than 0.01). At follow-up, the oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry was 85.8 +/- 2.9% (mean 5.8 +/- 1.7 months after balloon dilation) and the hemoglobin was 15.6 +/- 1.9 g/dl (mean 6.6 +/- 1.5 months after balloon dilation). 
Access to neurological care for minorities. Minority groups comprise a major segment of the estimated more than 34 million Americans without insurance coverage and also the underinsured. Neurologic disease and neurologic complications of the major causes of morbidity and mortality affect minorities protracted by limited access to health care. Hypertension, a major cause of stroke in the black population, is just one example of the impact of accessibility to intervention in central nervous system disease. Health statistics note the persisting gap between minority groups and the nation's norms for life expectancy. Aging America and particularly black elderly women, combined with the lagging infant mortality among minority groups, demonstrate limited access issues beyond economics, reflecting inner city mores, cultural barriers, and communication delay limiting contact with the practicing neurologist. Awareness of such access limitations to neurological care for minorities demands the attention of the practicing neurologist and the neurological societies. 
Cerebral infarction in young people. A study of 148 patients with early cerebral angiography. The aetiology of strokes was studied in a hospital based series of patients aged up to 40 years with precise clinical and radiological criteria. One hundred and forty five patients (75 males and 73 females) aged five to 40 years with cerebral ischaemia were evaluated. Aetiology was heterogeneous and could be classified into seven groups. Cerebral arteriograms were performed in all cases and indicated the aetiological diagnosis in most patients. Embolism was the most frequent recognised abnormality (38.4%). There were no complications of arteriography. Arterial dissections discovered by arteriography were the cause of the stroke in 10.1% of the patients. Atherosclerosis was diagnosed in 32 cases and was the commonest cause (21.6%). In one fifth of cases no cause was found. Contraceptive drugs were considered as potential cause of ischaemic stroke in 11.5%, cardiac diseases in 12.8% and haematological disorders in 8.1%. Other potential causes included migraine, inflammatory diseases, pregnancy and lacunas. Follow up in 126 cases showed that many patients had good functional recovery. 
Arthrodesis of the knee with an intramedullary nail. The cases of twenty patients who had an arthrodesis in which an intramedullary nail was used for stabilization were reviewed at an average follow-up of six years. The predominant indications were infection after total knee arthroplasty and post-traumatic pain and instability. Other indications included aseptic loosening of the components of a total knee arthroplasty, reconstruction after resection of a giant-cell tumor, non-union of a fracture of the distal part of the femur or the proximal part of the tibia, and failed external-compression arthrodesis. Success was achieved in seventeen patients (85 per cent), and functional stability immediately postoperatively was gained in all twenty. Of the three patients in whom the arthrodesis failed, all had sustained an intraoperative fracture, and infection eventually developed. Of the twelve nails that were secured to the greater trochanter with a loop of stainless-steel wire, none showed evidence of proximal migration. Of the eight nails that were not thus secured, two migrated proximally, necessitating removal of the nail. Two drawbacks to this operation are the long duration and the large amount of blood that is lost. The major advantage is that a high percentage of patients have progression to a stable fusion despite serious problems. Furthermore, all but seven patients (including the six who had a tumor or who had sustained an intraoperative fracture) were able to bear full weight by the second postoperative week. Only a few patients needed an external support for walking. 
Role of thromboxane and serotonin as mediators in the development of spontaneous alterations in coronary blood flow and neointimal proliferation in canine models with chronic coronary artery stenoses and endothelial injury. Platelet-mediated obstruction of stenotic and endothelium-injured coronary arteries may be important in the abrupt progression from chronic stable to unstable coronary heart disease syndromes in patients. Transcardiac accumulation of thromboxane A2 and serotonin has been demonstrated in patients as chronic stable angina is converted to unstable angina. In this study in anesthetized open chest dogs with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury, thromboxane A2 and serotonin were shown to be important mediators of intermittent coronary obstruction caused by platelet aggregation and dynamic vasoconstriction. Furthermore, thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists and serotonin receptor antagonists, singly and together, provided substantial protection against repetitive platelet aggregation and dislodgment in canine models with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury even when systemic catecholamine concentrations were markedly elevated. These same observations apply in chronically instrumented, awake, unsedated dogs with coronary artery stenosis and endothelial injury in which recurrent platelet attachment and dislodgment cause cyclic flow alterations that may be prevented by thromboxane A2 synthesis inhibitors and receptor antagonists and serotonin receptor antagonists. Chronically instrumented dogs with coronary stenosis and endothelial injury in which recurrent platelet attachment and dislodgment occurred also developed neointimal proliferation of varying severity within 10 days to 3 weeks; the morphologic appearance of the neointimal proliferation was identical to that found in patients who develop restenosis after coronary angioplasty. 
Substitution of leucine for isoleucine in a sequence highly conserved among retroviral envelope surface glycoproteins attenuates the lytic effect of the Friend murine leukemia virus. Friend murine leukemia virus is a replication-competent retrovirus that contains no oncogene and that exerts lytic and leukemogenic properties. Thus, newborn mice inoculated with Friend murine leukemia virus develop severe early hemolytic anemia before appearance of erythroleukemia. To identify the retroviral determinants regulating these effects, we used chimeric infectious constructions and site-directed point mutations between a virulent Friend murine leukemia virus strain and a naturally occurring variant attenuated in lytic and leukemogenic effects. We found that severe hemolytic anemia was always associated with higher numbers of blood reticulocytes with budding retroviral particles. Furthermore, a remarkably conservative leucine to isoleucine change in the extracellular SU component of the retroviral envelope was sufficient to attenuate this lytic effect. Also, this leucine at position 348 of the envelope precursor protein was located within the only stretch of five amino acids that is conserved in the extracellular SU component of all murine, feline, and primate type C and type D retroviral envelopes. This observation suggested an important structural function for this yet undescribed conserved sequence of the envelope. Lastly, we observed that lytic and leukemogenic effects were attenuated by a deletion of a second repeat in the transcriptional enhancer region of the viral long terminal repeats of the variant strain. 
Mesonephric rest hyperplasia. A potential diagnostic pitfall. A case of mesonephric rest hyperplasia, an incidental finding in the hysterectomy specimen of a 48-year-old woman, was initially misdiagnosed as a well-differentiated cervical adenocarcinoma. We highlight the histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical features of this potential diagnostic pitfall and review the relevant literature. 
Coarctation: do we need to resect ductal tissue? A review of the literature as well as a retrospective review of 100 neonates undergoing operation for coarctation at Children's Hospital in Boston between 1972 and 1984 has not established clear superiority for either resection and end-to-end anastomosis or subclavian flap aortoplasty with respect to risk of recurrent coarctation. However, there is histological evidence that the juxtaductal coarctation shelf is composed of smooth muscle of ductal origin, which subsequently fibroses. This abnormal tissue may be at risk for late aneurysm development, particularly if balloon dilatation angioplasty is required. The fact that this abnormal tissue is not removed by the subclavian flap procedure is one of the inherent disadvantages of that procedure. Other disadvantages include the need to sacrifice the left subclavian artery and the fact that, unlike resection and end-to-end anastomosis, the subclavian flap procedure does not lend itself to augmentation of the hypoplastic distal aortic arch. Furthermore, occasionally a secondary coarctation membrane is present within the distal aortic arch, and though it is readily detected during the resection procedure, it can be missed with the subclavian flap procedure. Based on these considerations rather than on a demonstrated superiority of either procedure, my colleagues and I currently prefer resection and end-to-end anastomosis over subclavian flap aortoplasty. 
Circus movement atrial flutter in canine sterile pericarditis model. Activation patterns during entrainment and termination of single-loop reentry in vivo. BACKGROUND. Recently, we used a custom designed "jacket" electrode with 127 bipolar electrodes in a flexible nylon matrix to map the total atrial epicardial surface in the in situ canine heart. Atrial flutter in dogs with sterile pericarditis was shown to be due to a single wave front circulating around a combined functional/anatomic obstacle, with the arc of functional conduction block contiguous with one or more of the atrial vessels. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, this model was used to analyze the activation pattern during pacing-induced entrainment and termination of single reentrant loops in a syncytium without anatomically predetermined pathways. Sustained atrial flutter was induced in five dogs with 3-5-day-old sterile pericarditis. Atrial pacing at a cycle length 5-30 msec shorter than the spontaneous cycle length entrained the arrhythmia and could result in a "classical" activation pattern, characterized by an antidromic stimulated wave that collided with the reentrant orthodromic wave front of the previous beat at a constant site. However, two variations of this classical activation pattern were also observed: 1) Pacing at short cycle lengths could lead to localized conduction block in antidromic direction, forcing a change in the pathway of the antidromic wave front. This could prevent the expected shift of the site of collision in antidromic direction. 2) The stimulated orthodromic wave front could also use a pathway different from that of the original reentrant impulse, so that a different circuit was active during the pacing period. Termination of atrial flutter by rapid atrial stimulation was associated with progressive slowing and finally blocking of the paced orthodromic wave front and a progressive shift of the site of collision in antidromic direction. The occurrence of conduction block was determined by the cycle length of stimulation and the number of stimulated beats. A longer train at the critical cycle length or the critical number of beats at a shorter cycle length could reinduce the same reentrant circuit or a different reentrant circuit, respectively, during stimulated cycles following the beat that terminated reentry. CONCLUSIONS. The epicardial activation sequence during entrainment of reentrant arrhythmias does not necessarily follow a standard activation pattern. Instead, the stimulated orthodromic as well as the antidromic wave front might use a pathway different from that of the original reentrant wave front. The mechanisms of termination, failure of termination, and reinitiation of single-loop reentry are similar to those in the "figure-eight" reentrant circuit. 
The use of nasal calcitonin in the treatment of post-traumatic algodystrophy. Calcitonin is widely used in the treatment of algodystrophy but a major disadvantage is the need for its parenteral administration. For this reason, we evaluated the effect of 400 iu of nasal calcitonin in the treatment of post-traumatic algodystrophy in a prospective randomized double-blind study. We found no demonstrable effect on the clinical or skeletal progression of the disorder using sensitive methods of measuring the response to treatment. There was, however, a small but significant hypocalcaemic response in the treatment group despite no change in the other indices of bone turnover. Possible reasons for this lack of clinical and skeletal effect are discussed. 
Blunt traumatic bladder rupture: the role of retrograde cystogram. STUDY OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the importance of microscopic and gross hematuria and the role of retrograde cystography and computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of blunt traumatic bladder rupture. DESIGN: All cases at a Level I trauma center between January 1, 1986, and March 31, 1989, were reviewed retrospectively. SETTING: Level I trauma center, university hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients with acute blunt abdominal trauma admitted to this Level I trauma center. INTERVENTIONS: The patients' charts were reviewed with emphasis on mode of diagnosis, treatment, and outcome. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-one patients had bladder rupture. All 21 had hematuria with more than 50 RBCs/high-power field, 17 gross and four microscopic. Twenty patients underwent retrograde cystography, which accurately identified bladder rupture, and one was found at laparotomy for other injuries. Seven patients had CT of the abdomen and pelvis, which failed to demonstrate bladder rupture. There were no associated urethral injuries in any of the patients with bladder rupture. CONCLUSION: Significant (more than 50 RBCs/high-power field) hematuria is the principal indication for evaluation for blunt bladder injury, and retrograde cystography is the diagnostic procedure of choice. CT is neither sensitive nor specific enough as primary diagnostic modality. 
A novel mutation in the invariant AG of the acceptor splice site of intron 4 of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit gene in two unrelated American black GM2-gangliosidosis (Tay-Sachs disease) patients. Samples of genomic DNA from three unrelated American black infants having both biochemical and clinical features of classical infantile Tay-Sachs disease were sequenced following PCR amplification. A G----T transversion was observed in the AG acceptor splice site preceding exon 5 of the beta-hexosaminidase alpha-subunit gene in the first black family. This transversion changed the acceptor splice site from the consensus sequence, AG, to AT, thereby interfering with splicing at this intron 4/exon 5 junction. The proband was homozygous for this mutation; his mother and a brother are heterozygous. The same mutation was found in a second, apparently unrelated, black GM2-gangliosidosis patient. The second patient was a compound heterozygote, as only one allele carried this mutation. The mother and a brother in this second family are carriers for this mutation, while the father and a noncarrier sister are normal for this region of the gene. The third proband did not have this mutation; nor did the mother of a fourth black proband. Eight other independently ascertained non-black, non-Jewish, GM2-gangliosidosis families did not have this mutation. The observation of the same novel mutation in two unrelated black GM2-gangliosidosis patients indicates that the American black population has segregating within it at least one GM2-gangliosidosis mutation which may be specific to this population and not a result of migration. 
Bopindolol: Czechoslovak experience with a new beta blocker in the treatment of hypertension. Bopindolol is a nonselective beta blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. One of the drug's main benefits is its prolonged effect, lasting for 24 hours, which makes it possible to administer bopindolol in a single daily dose, a fact that may improve patient adherence to therapy. A double-blind study was performed in two centers, comparing bopindolol with metoprolol in 86 hypertensive patients. Baseline diastolic blood pressure (BP) was 100 to 120 mm Hg. The effects of bopindolol or metoprolol on BP and heart rate were similar: return to normal values was achieved in 70% of patients with either drug. A 6-month study at another center found that bopindolol did not affect the levels of total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. Another 12-month study documented a decrease in total cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) A1 and apo B. The apo A/B ratio rose, thus improving the atherosclerotic index. No deterioration of glucose tolerance or immunoreactive insulin response to glucose was seen after 6 months of bopindolol administration. Bopindolol satisfactorily modifies not only resting but also exercise BP during isometric and isotonic load, thus reducing BP fluctuation during physical activities of the hypertensive patient. The drug exerts no effect on renal and liver function, electrolyte balance and hematologic parameters. Bopindolol is a very useful drug of first choice in mild and moderate hypertension. Bopindolol's main advantages include its prolonged action, good tolerance and a beneficial effect on risk factors of atherosclerosis (lipid and carbohydrate metabolism). 
Short and long term outcome of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in unstable versus stable angina pectoris: a report of the 1985-1986 NHLBI PTCA Registry. In a cohort of 1,720 consecutive patients from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) Registry (August 1985-May 1986), we compared 768 patients (45%) with stable angina and 952 patients (55%) with unstable angina pectoris. Unstable angina patients exhibited at least one of the following characteristics: new onset angina, rapidly progressing angina, angina at rest, angina refractory to medication, variant angina, acute coronary insufficiency, or angina recurring shortly after an acute myocardial infarct. The distribution of single- and multi-vessel disease was similar among stable and unstable angina patients; multi-vessel disease predominated. Average severity of stenosis and incidence of tubular and diffuse stenosis morphology were higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Patient success rates were similar in stable and unstable patients. However, on a per lesion basis, overall angiographic success rate and average reduction of severity of stenosis in successfully dilated lesions were significantly higher among patients with unstable angina (both p less than 0.001). Incidence of major patient complications (p less than 0.01) and of emergency coronary bypass surgery (p less than 0.05) were also higher in patients with unstable angina but consistent with their more precarious clinical condition and stenosis morphology. During a two year follow-up, the cumulative distributions of death, myocardial infarct, repeat PTCA, and coronary bypass surgery were not significantly different in patients with stable angina compared to patients with unstable angina. Comparison of the current PTCA Registry cohort with the cases reported in the 1979-1982 Registry revealed a 19% higher success rate for both stable and unstable angina patients. Major complication rates decreased between time periods for stable but not for unstable angina patients. Incidence of emergency bypass surgery decreased more for stable than for unstable angina patients. Coronary angioplasty is indicated in properly selected patients with unstable angina and both single- and multi-vessel coronary disease. 
Experimental treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion. The role of laser energy in the treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion was evaluated in two sets of experiments. First, 10 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were used to replace segments of the superficial femoral arteries in dogs and were thrombosed by distal ligation. Occlusion was maintained for one hour, or for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in each of two grafts. Patency was restored in all 10 grafts without perforation or anastomotic disruption using a 2 mm hot tip probe powered by an Argon laser. However, increased organization of thrombus related to the duration of occlusion lead to decreased laser channel diameters, and 75% of the 28 day thrombus remained in the graft after recanalization. The second experiments tested the added benefit of thrombolytic infusion following laser recanalization. Bilateral external iliac artery thrombosis was induced in dogs by operative vessel isolation, de-endothelialization, and thrombin injection. At 7 days the efficacy of laser-assisted thrombolysis (LAT) versus enzymatic thrombolysis (ET) alone was compared. Eight vessels underwent ET by urokinase (4000 I.U./min.); 14 vessels were laser recanalized prior to thrombolytic infusion. LAT was performed from a carotid artery approach in 8 vessels (antegrade) and from a femoral artery in 6 vessels (retrograde). In contrast to studies using the hot tip alone, both ET and LAT accomplished complete thrombus removal. However, LAT lead to significant iliac arterial flow in 9 +/- 8 min. (antegrade) and 25 +/- 8 min. (retrograde) while ET required 109 +/- 47 min (p less than 0.01). 
Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (Pena-Shokeir phenotype) associated with acquired intrauterine brain damage. An infant with Pena-Shokeir phenotype was born to a cocaine-using mother. The pathologic findings included polyhydramnios, facial anomalies, arthrogryposis, camptodactyly, pulmonary hypoplasia, and tetralogy of Fallot. The neuropathologic findings were diffuse brainstem and spinal cord neuronal degeneration and focal cerebral infarction, consistent with acquired intrauterine ischemic damage. 
The infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy. The otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon is frequently consulted to evaluate patients before the administration of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy. Fifty consecutive patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania Oncology Center were studied before and during chemotherapy for adult leukemia or bone marrow transplantation. Otolaryngic history, physical examination, radiographic studies, and hematologic surveys were analyzed for the duration of therapy in an attempt to identify risk factors for infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications. Two-thirds of the patient studied experienced untoward effects that required the further attention of an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon. The various complications and associated correlations with the study parameters before and during chemotherapy are discussed. 
Elevated plasma chromogranin-A concentrations in prostatic carcinoma. Chromogranin-A is considered a sensitive immunohistochemical tissue marker in neuroendocrine prostatic carcinoma. We report that the plasma chromogranin-A level was elevated in 48% of 25 patients with stage D2 prostate cancer, and suggest that this marker can be used to monitor the clinical course of these patients. 
Thoracic myelopathy caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum. Clinicopathologic study and surgical treatment. The authors reviewed 14 patients with thoracic myelopathy caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF). The predominant locality of symptomatic OLF was at the thoracolumbar junction, particularly at T10-11 followed by T11-12. At the level of the thickest OLF in each patient, there were three types of OLF from computed tomography and operative findings: a lateral type in 3 patients, diffuse in 8, and thickened nodular in 3. The diagnosis of OLF-related thoracic spinal canal stenosis was best made by enhanced computed tomography. Histologic study revealed that the developmental mode of OLF was mainly endochondral ossification. Numerous fibrocartilaginous cells were found in the increased and swollen collagen fibers forming the hypertrophic ligamentum flavum (HLF). Ossification extended along the superficial layer of HLF. The size or extension of OLF was relevant to the corresponding diathesis of spinalhyperostosis. Results of laminectomy for OLF were poor because of the high occurrence of complications early on or later deterioration. Therefore, laminoplasty is recommended as a successful procedure for OLF-related thoracic myelopathy, avoiding further local mechanical stress due to tensile force. 
Significance of a negative exercise thallium test in the presence of a critical residual stenosis after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. After thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, increasing emphasis is placed on early submaximal exercise testing, with further intervention advocated only for demonstrable ischemia. Although significant residual coronary artery lesions after successful thrombolysis are common, many patients paradoxically have no corresponding provokable ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. The relation between significant postthrombolytic residual coronary artery disease and a negative early, submaximal exercise thallium-201 tomogram was studied among 101 consecutive patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction and at least 70% residual stenosis of the infarct artery. A negative test occurred in 49 (48.5%) patients with a mean 88% residual infarct artery stenosis. Further characteristics of the group were as follows: mean time to treatment was 3.1 hours; mean age was 54 +/- 10 years; 80% were male; 47% had anterior infarction; 39% had multivessel disease; mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 53 +/- 14%; and mean peak creatine kinase level was 3,820 +/- 3,123 IU/ml. A similar group of 52 (51.5%) patients, treated within 3.3 hours from symptom onset, with a mean postthrombolysis stenosis of 90%, had a positive exercise test. Characteristics of this group were as follows: age was 58 +/- 10 years; 92% were male; 56% had anterior infarction; 40% had multivessel disease; and mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 54 +/- 15%. The peak creatine kinase level associated with the infarction, however, was lower: 2,605 +/- 1,805 IU/ml (p = 0.04). There was no difference in performance at exercise testing with respect to peak systolic pressure, peak heart rate, or time tolerated on the treadmill between the two groups. By multivariate logistic regression, only peak creatine kinase level predicted a negative stress result in the presence of a significant residual stenosis (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-16.3). CONCLUSIONS. The explanation for the relatively frequent finding of a negative early stress 201Tl tomogram after apparently successful reperfusion appears to be more extensive myocardial necrosis and not delay in therapy or inadequate exercise performance. 
Therapeutic effects of genetically engineered toxin (DAB486IL-2) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In DAB486IL-2 the receptor-binding domain of native diphtheria toxin is replaced by human IL-2 sequences. This recombinant fusion protein is selectively cytotoxic for cells bearing high-affinity IL-2 receptors--eg, leukaemic cells. A patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who did not respond to gamma interferon and conventional antileukaemic drugs has responded to DAB486IL-2. 
The prevalence of autoantibodies during third-trimester pregnancy complicated by hypertension or idiopathic fetal growth retardation. Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, antinuclear, anti-deoxyribonucleic acid, antithyroglobulin, and antithyroid microsomal antibodies were assayed during third-trimester pregnancy (100 normal, 100 with complications). In spite of a normal activated partial thromboplastin time in all instances, lupus anticoagulant was further investigated by three additional procedures: tissue thromboplastin inhibition time, platelet neutralization procedure, and cephalin neutralization test. The prevalence of autoantibodies in pregnancies with hypertension reaches 16% (four with lupus anticoagulant, two with anticardiolipin, and two with antithyroid microsomal antibodies), which is significantly greater than that for idiopathic fetal growth retardation (2%) (one with lupus anticoagulant antibodies) and normal pregnancies (3%) (two with antithyroglobulin and one with autithyroid microsomal antibodies) (p less than 0.01). Autoantibodies were equally distributed between patients with gestational hypertension and those with preeclampsia. When compared with the 42 patients with hypertension and no autoantibodies, the eight patients with autoantibody had a more frequent history of fetal growth retardation (p less than 0.05), but there was no difference in the severity of hypertension, the frequency of obstetric complications, or the outcome of pregnancy. They did not require any specific treatment. 
Atrial fibrillation associated with autonomic dysreflexia in patients with tetraplegia. Atrial fibrillation is an arrhythmia characterized by disorganized atrial depolarizations and an irregular ventricular response. Most patients with atrial fibrillation have underlying cardiac pathology. This paper presents the cases of three patients with high-level spinal cord injury and symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia who developed atrial fibrillation without any cardiac or metabolic disease that would predispose them to this. The paper proposes that autonomic dysreflexia might predispose a patient to atrial fibrillation by altering the pattern of repolarization of the atria, making the heart susceptible to a reentrant type of arrhythmia. High-level spinal cord injured patients may be at increased risk for the development of atrial fibrillation, an arrhythmia which, if left untreated, can increase the incidence of an embolic cerebrovascular accident that could further impair the patient's functional status. 
Selection of the approach to the distal internal carotid artery from the second cervical vertebra to the base of the skull. Although several approaches for exposure of distal internal carotid artery lesions have been reported, the precise anatomic levels for which each of these maneuvers are most appropriate have not been well described. Since these techniques may require preoperative preparation, it is useful to determine in advance how much exposure will be needed and to select the most suitable and effective technique. We used anatomic dissection in 12 human cadaver specimens (24 carotid bifurcations) to define the limits of distal internal carotid artery exposure by several commonly advocated methods. The standard anterior approach along the sternocleidomastoid muscle allowed exposure of the internal carotid artery to the level of the upper one third of the second cervical vertebra. The upper limit of this exposure was extended to the middle of the first cervical vertebra by division of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. Anterior subluxation of the mandible increased the distal exposure of the internal carotid artery to the superior border of the first cervical vertebra. Styloidectomy in combination with the preceding maneuvers extended the exposure an additional 0.5 cm cephalad. Lateral mandibulotomy did not significantly extend exposure beyond that obtained with mandibular subluxation and styloidectomy. Exposure of the internal carotid artery in the 1 cm immediately below the base of the skull required a posterior approach with mastoidectomy. 
Time course of creatine kinase release after termination of sustained ventricular dysrhythmias. Differentiation between primary and secondary (caused by acute myocardial infarction) ventricular fibrillation has important therapeutic and prognostic implications. The diagnosis of myocardial infarction is based on clinical, ECG, and creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (MBCK) activity. Enzymatic criteria might not be able to confirm the diagnosis of myocardial infarction after recent cardioversion. The routine use of electrophysiologic studies involving the induction and termination of ventricular dysrhythmias provides a setting in which enzyme release as a result of cardioversion alone can be examined. Therefore a systematic investigation of the magnitude and time course of creatine kinase (CK) and MBCK release was performed after termination of ventricular dysrhythmias in 57 patients undergoing electrophysiologic studies. Of patients requiring external cardioversion, only 50% had an elevation in CK and MBCK activity. Elevation when present corrected with the number of shocks and cumulative energy delivered. The magnitude of MBCK release exceeded 10% of the total CK activity in 9% of observations. Pace-termination of ventricular tachycardia did not result in enzyme release. Arrhythmia characteristics, coronary artery disease, and left ventricular function did not affect the magnitude of the time course of enzyme release. These data suggest that cardioversion with multiple shocks may result in a component of MBCK release, and thus a false positive diagnosis of primary acute myocardial infarction may be made by relying exclusively on the enzyme release pattern. 
Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty following surgical repair of sinus venosus atrial septal defect. Mitral valvuloplasty performed 5 y after repair of a sinus venosus ASD was difficult because of a thickened septum, but resulted in improved mitral valve opening and did not lead to ASD. Thus, prior repair of a sinus venosus ASD may not be an absolute contraindication to mitral valvuloplasty. 
Lumbar regional anaesthesia and prophylactic anticoagulant therapy. Is the combination safe? A survey has been carried out in all Danish anaesthetic departments (n = 80) regarding the attitude towards the use of epidural/spinal lumbar analgesia in patients who were receiving prophylactic anticoagulant therapy for the prevention of thromboembolism. About 60% of the departments used the techniques in patients receiving low-dose heparin and no side effects had been experienced. Spinal and epidural anaesthesia were in general regarded as being contraindicated in patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. In the world literature, the attitude towards the combination is conflicting. No randomised trial has been performed and complications are almost entirely confined to patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. Only one case of an epidural haematoma has been recorded when subcutaneous low-dose heparin was used as thromboprophylaxis. 
Local toxicity with subcutaneous methadone. Experience of two centers. We report on 8 patients treated with subcutaneous methadone for cancer-related pain at 2 institutions. The success of other subcutaneous agents for pain control has been well demonstrated. It was felt that methadone would be useful due to its low cost. Unfortunately, 7 of the 8 patients experienced adverse reactions at the subcutaneous sites requiring cessation of subcutaneous methadone. 
Effect of calcification on in vivo mechanical response of rabbit arteries to balloon dilation. BACKGROUND. Atherosclerosis has been associated with loss of artery wall distensibility in human cadavers and in experimental animal models, giving it the lay term "hardening of the arteries." METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the effect of calcification on arterial distensibility, balloon pressure and volume were recorded during dilation of calcified aortas in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits in vivo. Calcification was induced by dietary supplements of cholesterol, vitamin D2, and calcium. Balloon pressure, volume, and time signals were acquired at high frequency with controls for temperature and balloon inflation rate. Resistance to balloon dilation was minimal in control rabbit aortas (delta Vmax = 5.0 +/- 3.5 microliters) and in excised nonatherosclerotic human coronary arteries, and it was small in aortas from cholesterol-fed rabbits (12.3 +/- 8 microliters), even when lipid levels were markedly elevated by a high cholesterol diet (611 +/- 347 mg/dl). With dietary cholesterol, vitamin D2, and calcium supplements, WHHL rabbits developed mild hypercalcemia (15 +/- 1.9 mg/dl), hypercholesterolemia (1,100 +/- 633 mg/dl), moderate-to-marked aortic calcification, and high resistance to balloon dilation (38 +/- 27) comparable to that seen in angioplasty patients. CONCLUSIONS. It is concluded that experimentally induced calcification decreases the distensibility of the rabbit aorta in vivo and that it yields to balloon dilation by plastic deformation closely resembling that seen in balloon angioplasty of human coronary arteries. These findings suggest that calcification contributes to arterial "hardening" associated with atherosclerosis. 
Relationship between the timing of aneurysm surgery and the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. A consecutive series of 145 patients with acute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were operated on within 7 days of SAH and were prospectively evaluated over a 4-year period to determine if the timing of aneurysm surgery influenced the development of delayed cerebral ischemia. All patients were managed with a standardized policy of urgent surgical clipping and treatment with aggressive prophylactic postoperative volume expansion. Patients with delayed ischemic symptoms were additionally treated with induced hypertension. Forty-nine patients underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 (Group 1) post-SAH, 60 patients on Day 2 or 3 (Group 2), and 36 patients on Days 4 through 7 (Group 3). Postoperative delayed cerebral ischemia developed in 16% of (Group 1) patients, in 22% of Group 2 patients, and in 28% of Group 3 patients. Cerebral infarction resulting from delayed cerebral ischemia developed in only 4% of Group 1 patients, 10% of Group 2 patients, and 11% of Group 3 patients. A bad clinical outcome as a result of delayed cerebral ischemia occurred in one Group 1 patient (2%), two Group 2 patients (3%), and one Group 3 patient (3%). Preoperative grade was not significantly correlated with the incidence or severity of delayed cerebral ischemia at any time interval except that patients in modified Hunt and Hess Grade I or II who underwent surgery on Day 0 or 1 after SAH had no strokes or bad outcomes from delayed cerebral ischemia. This study demonstrates that there is no rationale for delaying aneurysm surgery based on the time interval between SAH and patient evaluation. 
Carnitine deficiency associated with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. An infant with X-linked recessive ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is described who also had severe deficiency of plasma and liver carnitine during normoammonemic periods. Treatment with L-carnitine (100 mg/kg/day) for 12 months decreased the frequency of hospitalizations for hyperammonemia, although it did not alter his neurologic status. This report demonstrates that persistent carnitine deficiency may be present in patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency even when plasma ammonia is normal. Carnitine evaluation and supplementation may be important in the treatment of patients with this metabolic disorder. 
Do primary dysfunctions in neural control of arterial pressure contribute to hypertension? This article is a summary of the physiological and clinical evidence that links the cause of essential hypertension to the brain. We stress the potential importance of a biochemical disturbance in the central role of angiotensin II in the regulation of arterial pressure. While the evidence is compelling, we acknowledge the need for further complete studies on this timely subject. 
Oral contraceptive-associated liver cell adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cytomorphology and mechanism of malignant transformation. From January 1976 to May 1990, 1673 patients with a liver mass or masses detected by imaging techniques underwent percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the liver. Of these, 99 were diagnosed cytologically as "hepatocellular carcinoma" and 9 as "consistent with liver cell adenoma." The cytologic diagnoses were confirmed in the follow-up of all cases. Among the 99 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 3 had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 10, 11, and 12 years, respectively. The nine patients with liver cell adenoma were all users of oral contraceptives over a period ranging from 5 to 10 years. Of these, two who had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 8 and 10 years, respectively, had foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia within the adenomas. The cytologic criteria for the diagnosis of liver cell dysplasia included cytoplasmic and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism together with prominent nucleoli, hyperchromasia and multinucleation. The cytologic features of liver cell dysplasia strikingly mimic hepatocellular carcinoma. From this study, the foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia arising within the liver cell adenomas appear to be the missing link responsible for the transformation of liver cell adenoma to carcinoma. It is believed that liver cell adenomas are not premalignant and may undergo reversible change after withdrawal of causative agents, whereas liver cell dysplasia is an irreversible, premalignant change and will eventually progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Ovarian ablation failures by radiation: a comparison of two dose schedules. Sixty Chinese breast cancer patients underwent ovarian irradiation with one of two dose schedules: 12 Gy/4 fractions/4-6 days or 14 Gy/4 fractions/4-6 days. The ovarian ablation failure rates were 14% and 0% respectively in patients above 40 years of age. The overall ablation failure rate in younger patients was unacceptably high at 35%. The significance of the findings is discussed. 
Olfactory dysfunction in three neurodegenerative diseases. Olfactory dysfunction is among the first signs of Alzheimer's disease (AD), idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD), and the parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) of Guam. We have recently demonstrated that the odor identification and detection deficits of patients with PD are equivalent to those of patients with mild AD when subtle differences in cognitive function are statistically controlled for by analysis of covariance. In contrast, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and patients with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced parkinsonism evidence olfactory function much more similar to that of normal controls. In the present study, we administered the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and the Picture Identification Test to 24 patients with early signs of the PDC of Guam and statistically compared their test scores to those of 24 early-stage AD and 24 early-stage PD patients of similar age and gender from the United States mainland. Although the PDC group evidenced slightly more difficulty in identifying pictures than did the other 2 groups, the odor identification deficit associated with this disorder was of the same magnitude as that observed in AD and PD, suggesting that olfactory testing cannot be used to distinguish among these 3 diseases and that the olfactory dysfunction of these disorders may reflect a common neurologic substrate. 
Mammographic guidewire localization of nonpalpable breast lesions. Guidewire-directed biopsy is the predominant method of evaluating nonpalpable breast lesions detected by mammography. It is an accurate and safe procedure for obtaining a histologic evaluation of abnormal tissue, leading to early diagnosis and improved survival rates. This report reviews 526 needle localizations and biopsies of nonpalpable breast lesions performed in two community hospitals over a 39-month period and compares early results with those achieved in the last 13 months of the study. This review indicates that as experience in using this modality increased, the cancer detection rate increased and the percentage of invasive cancers decreased. The percentage of cancers detected in the final 13 months of the study (19%, Group II) was higher than in the first 26 months of the study (13%, Group I). Although microcalcifications were found in 24 per cent of the mammograms leading to a diagnosis of cancer, they did not prove to be a reliable indicator of malignancy in this study. 
Parkinson's disease in Ferrara, Italy, 1967 through 1987. Epidemiological surveys on Parkinson's disease that have been carried out in different parts of the world have suggested that the disease is uniformly distributed in white populations. The position with regard to the Mediterranean peoples is still controversial, because of the large variation of the frequencies observed in the different areas that have been investigated. We therefore studied the frequency of Parkinson's disease in the Local Health Service of Ferrara, northeastern Italy (mean population, 187,000). Based on 394 patients, the mean incidence per year for the period from 1967 through 1987 was 10.01/100,000. The incidence rate of Parkinson's disease among cases with early onset was found to be statistically higher in rural areas as compared with urban ones (6.32/100,000 vs 3.11/100,000). Moreover, the study revealed a significantly higher incidence rate among agricultural workers (20.6/100,000). These results would seem to give further support to the hypothesis of a possible causal role of environmental factors that are mainly linked to agriculture, most likely due to the continual exposure to toxic agents in this area. However, further studies, which are not exclusively epidemiological, are necessary before any conclusions may be drawn, because many confounding variables may account for the results from surveys of this type. 
Common bile duct and intrahepatic stones: results of transhepatic electrohydraulic lithotripsy in 50 patients. Percutaneous, transhepatic, intracorporeal, electrohydraulic shock wave lithotripsy was performed in 50 patients after failure of endoscopic treatment (n = 43) or directly in patients with a strictured hepaticojejunostomy (n = 7). Twenty-seven patients had common bile duct stones; 23, intrahepatic stones. Three steps were used: A transhepatic bilicutaneous fistula was created, a wide communication between the bile duct and the gut was established, and contact shock wave lithotripsy was performed under endoscopic guidance. Afterward, 46 patients were free of stones. In four patients with diffuse intrahepatic lithiasis, only 75% of stones could be cleared. Severe complications, seen in 11 patients (hemobilia necessitating transfusion [n = 6], bile duct perforation resulting in cholangitis [n = 3], acute pulmonary edema [n = 1], and hemothorax [n = 1]), were fatal in four patients; all occurred early in the study. The authors modified their technique by dilating the biliary tract in two sessions 3 days apart, waiting 6 days for the tract to mature, and then introducing the cholangioscope directly through the skin, significantly reducing complications and mortality (P less than .005). 
Changes in mucociliary clearance during acute exacerbations of asthma. Previous studies have suggested that mucociliary clearance (MC) is impaired in asthmatic subjects. If so, impaired clearance may be an important factor in acute exacerbation. We proposed that if MC plays a significant role in acute illness, MC should be impaired during the exacerbation but improve after recovery. To test this hypothesis, five asthmatic patients with attacks requiring hospitalization underwent measurement of MC using radiolabeled aerosol and a gamma camera. They were studied on the second or third day after admission with repeat measurements after discharge. Spirometry was performed before all studies. After an equilibrium xenon scan (133Xe), which defined lung borders and measured regional volume, radiolabeled saline particles containing technetium-labeled (99mTC) sulfur colloid were deposited and used to label airway mucus. Deposition patterns were matched by regulating particle distribution and breathing pattern. MC was then measured as percentage retention of radioactivity at 10-min intervals for 2 h. When hospitalized, 96.0 +/- 2.06% (SEM) of the initial radioactivity was retained in the lung after 2 h, indicating little clearance of mucus from the lung. In fact, no significant changes were detected when activity at 120 min was compared with measurements at 10 min (99.2 +/- 0.22%, NS). After discharge clearance was markedly enhanced. That is, retention of lung activity was significantly lower at all time intervals from 10 min onward, with only 70.9 +/- 3.86% retained at 120 min (p = 0.008). During an asthmatic attack warranting hospital admission, MC is significantly impaired, with marked improvement following recovery. 
The effect of ERCP on circulating pancreatic enzymes and pancreatic protease inhibitors. The pathogenesis of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-induced pancreatitis is poorly understood. To elucidate a role for pancreatic enzymes in ERCP-induced pancreatitis, we measured serum amylase, lipase, trypsin, and elastase in 25 patients undergoing ERCP. Serum alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 2-macroglobulin, two major pancreatic protease inhibitors, also were measured. All pancreatic enzymes measured rose significantly after ERCP. Pancreatic duct cannulation was associated with a greater elevation in serum amylase and lipase. Circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin was reduced by 7% (p = 0.04) 6 h after ERCP, whereas circulating alpha 1-antitrypsin increased over the same time period. Papillotomy, stent placement, or underlying disease did not influence changes any further. Three patients developed ERCP-induced pancreatitis. All three patients had circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels below 243 mg/dl (p = 0.03). The ERCP-induced alterations in circulating pancreatic enzymes and their inhibitors are similar to changes seen in clinical pancreatitis. Low circulating alpha 2-macroglobulin levels may predispose to ERCP-induced pancreatitis. 
Stimulation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle by hypoxia. Hypoxia caused a progressive cytochalasin B-inhibitable increase in the rate of 3-O-methylglucose transport in rat epitrochlearis muscles to a level approximately six-fold above basal. Muscle ATP concentration was well maintained during hypoxia, and increased glucose transport activity was still present after 15 min of reoxygenation despite repletion of phosphocreatine. However, the increase in glucose transport activity completely reversed during a 180-min-long recovery in oxygenated medium. In perfused rat hindlimb muscles, hypoxia caused an increase in glucose transporters in the plasma membrane, suggesting that glucose transporter translocation plays a role in the stimulation of glucose transport by hypoxia. The maximal effects of hypoxia and insulin on glucose transport activity were additive, whereas the effects of exercise and hypoxia were not, providing evidence suggesting that hypoxia and exercise stimulate glucose transport by the same mechanism. Caffeine, at a concentration too low to cause muscle contraction or an increase in glucose transport by itself, markedly potentiated the effect of a submaximal hypoxic stimulus on sugar transport. Dantrolene significantly inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in 3-O-methylglucose transport. These effects of caffeine and dantrolene suggest that Ca2+ plays a role in the stimulation of glucose transport by hypoxia. 
Tegmental dehiscence and brain herniation into the middle ear cleft. The tegmen tympani may occasionally be breached by herniation of the temporal lobe with or without dural cover. The clinical presentation may be obvious with CSF otorrhoea but less so with apparent middle ear effusion, CSF rhinnorrhoea, conductive hearing loss, recurrent meningitis or intracranial sepsis. Diagnosis requires suspicion of the condition, which may be aided by radiological imaging. Surgical repair is to be recommended: various techniques are available but bone enveloped by fascia placed by subtemporal approach is preferred. The features of this problem are highlighted by four cases. 
A case of chronic GM1 gangliosidosis presenting as dystonia: clinical and biochemical studies. Clinical and biochemical studies are reported on a 32-year-old man with GM1 gangliosidosis who presented with a slowly progressive dystonia that began when he was aged 7 years and eventually became almost totally incapacitating at the age of 35. There was only mild intellectual deterioration, but myoclonus, seizures and macular cherry-red spots were never observed. Proton-density and T2-weighted MRI scans showed symmetrical hyperintense lesions of both putamina. No increase of GM1 ganglioside was found in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid, and the metabolism of GM1 ganglioside in cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient was also almost normal, although the residual activity of GM1 ganglioside beta-galactosidase activity was only 10% of normal. These findings suggest that impaired GM1 ganglioside metabolism is not present systemically as it is in the infantile and juvenile types of the disorder, but is mainly confined to the central nervous system in chronic GM1 gangliosidosis. 
Intrathecal baclofen for intractable axial dystonia. Following spinal instrumentation for scoliosis, a patient developed intractable axial dystonia refractory to conservative medical management. We describe the successful treatment of this dystonia with a continuous infusion of intrathecal baclofen and the subsequent long-term management. 
The treatment of metastatic breast cancer. While metastatic breast cancer is not curable, it is treatable. Its treatment is associated with a relatively high rate of success, and patients are able to maintain a good quality of life for periods ranging from a few months to several years. This knowledge should encourage both the patient and the oncologist to maintain treatment as long as potentially effective therapeutic methods are available. Progress is ongoing both in the development of new forms of treatment and in new ways of using and combining already existing therapeutic modalities. There is still no established "best" or "only" first treatment of metastatic breast cancer. When secondary and later treatment is to be undertaken, the task of selecting the most appropriate treatment becomes even more complex. It is only through controlled clinical trials that useful therapeutic guidelines will develop. Treatment is a joint endeavor involving both the physician and the patient. Communication must remain open. In the final stages of the illness, treatment should be directed toward the relief of distressing symptoms and anxiety. 
Cryptococcal pleural effusion preceding cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS. The authors report a case in which a small cryptococcal pleural effusion preceded the development of severe cryptococcal meningitis in an HIV-positive patient. The appearance of an isolated transient pleural effusion is a very unusual presentation for AIDS-related complications. The authors suggest that cryptococcal infection be considered in this setting. 
Smoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost--United States, 1988. Smoking is a leading cause of diseases associated with premature mortality in the United States; in 1985, these diseases accounted for an estimated 390,000 premature deaths. In this report, mortality data and estimates of smoking prevalence for 1988 are used to calculate smoking-attributable mortality (SAM), years of potential life lost (YPLL), and age-adjusted SAM and YPLL rates for the United States. Calculations were performed using Smoking-Attributable Mortality, Morbidity, and Economic Cost (SAMMEC II) software, which includes relative risk estimates for 22 adult (i.e., greater than or equal to 35 years of age) smoking-related diseases and relative risk estimates for four perinatal (i.e., less than 1 year of age) conditions. Age-, sex-, and race-specific mortality data for 1988 were obtained from CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Data on burn deaths caused by cigarettes were obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The estimated number of deaths among nonsmokers from lung cancer attributable to passive smoking was obtained from a report of the National Academy of Sciences. Age-, sex-, and race-specific current and former smoking prevalence rates in 1988 for adults aged greater than or equal to 35 years and for women aged 18-44 years were estimated by linear extrapolation using National Health Interview Survey data for 1974-1987. 
Questionable cancer practices in Tijuana and other Mexican border clinics. Tijuana, Mexico, has become a refuge for cancer patients who have been convinced that they may be cured of their terminal illness by unconventional, unproved, and disproved methods offered in the border clinics. About a dozen United States promoters have joined with Mexican colleagues to offer a variety of treatments. Some patients are diagnosed using standard methods prior to arrival at the clinics, but many healthy individuals are misdiagnosed as having cancer or "precancer" and are then treated there. Others are told they have been cured or are improving even though they still have active disease. The modalities and regimens used are often referred to as "metabolic therapy" and, for the most part, are either not based on sound scientific principles or have been shown in controlled clinical trials to be useless or even dangerous. A basic metabolic regimen consists of three phases: detoxification with fasting and bowel cleansing, strengthening the immune system with numerous "supplements," and attacking cancer with "natural and non-toxic" chemicals. Popular treatments include injections of hydrogen peroxide, large quantities of pressed liver and carrot juice, coffee enemas, infusions of Laetrile mixed with massive doses of vitamins and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), special diets, and a host of other pseudoscientific regimens. Unfortunately, no evidence exists that any of these modalities is more effective than no treatment at all. Patients traveling to the Mexican border clinics for metabolic therapy are subjecting themselves to costly and hazardous regimens, especially if they forgo responsible medical care in the process. The American Cancer Society, therefore, strongly urges individuals with cancer not to seek treatment with metabolic therapies in the Mexican border clinics. 
Ki-67 staining in histological subtypes of breast carcinoma and fine needle aspiration smears. Thirty four cases of invasive breast carcinoma were analysed for heterogeneity of Ki-67 reactivity in a tumour, and proliferative activity in various histological subtypes was compared. The growth factions determined in areas of central and peripheral tumour were the same. Mucinous and lobular carcinoma showed lower Ki-67 activity than ductal carcinomas. When ductal carcinomas were subdivided according to their dominant growth pattern, the carcinomas with a solid or comedo growth pattern showed the highest proliferative activity. These results largely confirm data from previous cell kinetic studies on the incorporation of radioactively labelled thymidine. A correlation between the growth fraction determined by Ki-67 in fine needle aspiration smears and cryostat sections of corresponding tumours was shown, implying that the immunostaining of cytological smears gives a reliable impression of the growth fraction of a tumour and may therefore be used in prospective studies. 
Transmetatarsal amputation: the role of adjunctive revascularization. Over a 12-year period, 160 transmetatarsal amputations were performed in patients with peripheral vascular occlusive disease. The following groups were defined: group 1 - nonreconstructable disease (n = 40); group 2 - transmetatarsal amputation in conjunction with distal revascularization (n = 99); group 3 - reconstructable disease but transmetatarsal amputation performed without simultaneous revascularization (n = 21). There were nine early deaths in the entire series, for an operative mortality rate of 5.6%. The lowest rate of transmetatarsal amputation healing (24%) occurred in group 1. An 86% healing rate was achieved in group 3, but in seven cases (33%) some type of revascularization was required within 3 months of the amputation. In group 2 the healing rate was 62% but reached 83% where the bypass remained patent for at least 3 months after the amputation. Long-term patency rates also affected healing. Healing was not influenced by the number of local procedures (single vs multiple). The presence of severe infection or extensive necrosis necessitated open transmetatarsal amputation in 89 cases; the remaining 71 amputations involved primary closure. Since many patients were treated at a time when diagnostic modalities as well as the operative indications and techniques differed somewhat from the current practice, much of the information regarding group I patients in particular should be considered as a negative historical control and any conclusion from our data should be adjusted accordingly. Healing after amputation at the transmetatarsal level can be expected in the majority of instances in which revascularization can be performed with predictable patency, even when the standard criteria for performing such amputations are liberalized. 
The relationship between esophageal motility disorders and microvascular angina. Patients with unexplained chest pain have caused investigators in cardiology, gastroenterology, and psychiatry to find abnormalities with overlap among the three specialties. This article reviews the data concerning the potential interrelation of chest pain of cardiac or esophageal origin. 
Deep brain stimulation: a review of basic research and clinical studies. Deep brain stimulation for pain control in humans was first used almost 30 years ago and has continued to receive considerable attention. Despite the large number of clinical reports describing pain relief, numerous studies have indicated that the results of these procedures vary considerably. In addition, many neurosurgeons find the procedures unpredictable, and considerable disagreement still exists regarding important issues related to the technique itself. This review gives an historical overview of the relevant basic and clinical literature and provides a critical examination of the clinical efficacy, choice of stimulation sites, parameters of stimulation, and effects on experimental pain. Finally, we give suggestions for future research that could more definitively determine the usefulness of deep brain stimulation for pain control. 
Establishment of cell-to-cell contact by adoptively transferred adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells with metastatic murine melanoma cells. A murine model of pulmonary B16 melanoma was used to study the infiltration into metastases of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and adherent lymphokine-activated killer (A-LAK) cells and, specifically, to study whether A-LAK cells are able to leave the tumor microcirculation and establish cell-to-cell contact with malignant cells. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that A-LAK cells accumulated in metastases twice as efficiently as LAK cells during interleukin-2 stimulation. Electron microscopy of pulmonary metastases 16 hours after administration of 2.5 x 10(7) A-LAK cells revealed A-LAK cells, identified by the presence of typical two-compartment granules, in direct contact with melanoma cells. This finding was confirmed by using A-LAK cells prelabeled with polycationized ferritin. In conclusion, our observations demonstrate unambiguously the ability of adoptively transferred A-LAK cells to establish contact with extravascular metastatic melanoma cells. 
A comparison of hypertensive and nonhypertensive coronary care patients' cardiovascular responses to visitors. Patients with and without hypertension in a coronary care unit (n = 24) were compared with respect to cardiovascular responses to both a family visit and an interview by an investigator. Variables for each of the four cardiovascular indicators (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and premature ventricular contractions) included the value before, the highest value during, the lowest value during, and the value after each social interaction condition. The highest group means for systolic blood pressure and heart rate were significantly higher for patients with hypertension than for patients without hypertension under both the interview and visit conditions. Differences in cardiovascular responses were not significantly greater for family visits than for interviews for patients with hypertension compared with those without hypertension. Thus, although hypertensive patients had greater cardiovascular reactivity to both social interaction conditions than nonhypertensive patients in the coronary care unit, family visits were no more physiologically stressful than a comparative interaction condition. 
Surgical manipulation of primate cerebral arteries in established vasospasm. It is generally believed that surgery in the face of angiographic vasospasm is dangerous due to an increased incidence of postoperative cerebral ischemia. One theory is that arterial narrowing is exacerbated by surgical manipulation of vasospastic vessels during aneurysm dissection and clipping. This theory was tested in a primate model of cerebral vasospasm and the results reported. Six monkeys underwent baseline cerebral angiography, followed by induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on both sides of the circle of Willis. An equal amount of fresh autologous blood clot was placed around each internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral artery. Six days later, angiography was repeated and the right craniectomy was reopened for clot evacuation and surgical manipulation of the right cerebral arteries, including placement of a temporary aneurysm clip on the right middle cerebral artery. The left cerebral arteries were not exposed or manipulated, and served as controls. Twenty-four hours later angiography was repeated, then the animals were killed. Equal and significant vasospasm (greater than 40% reduction in vessel caliber compared to baseline, p less than 0.05) was seen in the middle cerebral arteries on both sides of the circle of Willis in all animals 6 and 7 days after SAH. There was no significant change in the severity of vasospasm on Day 7 compared with Day 6 in the right cerebral arteries. Increased risk of postoperative cerebral ischemia for surgery in the peak vasospasm period may be due to mechanisms other than increased arterial narrowing precipitated by surgical manipulation. 
Autopsy-verified pulmonary embolism in a surgical department: analysis of the period from 1951 to 1988. A retrospective analysis was undertaken of all surgical patients in Malmo, Sweden, during the period from 1951 to 1988 in whom pulmonary emboli were found at autopsy. The analysis included a comparison with the earlier analysed and reported time period from 1951 to 1980. A continued high frequency of pulmonary embolism at autopsy was seen during the 1980s (20.3 per cent of deaths, 31.7 per cent of autopsies). Of the 391 autopsy-verified pulmonary emboli found between 1981 and 1988, 113 (28.9 per cent) were considered fatal, 104 (26.6 per cent) contributed to death and 174 (44.5 per cent) were incidental. Few patients had symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism before death. The overall frequency of major pulmonary embolism in surgical patients remained unchanged (0.3 per cent). The frequency of major postoperative pulmonary embolism showed an increase during the 1950s and 1960s (maximum 0.4 per cent) but a decrease in the last 5-year period of the 1970s (0.3 per cent), which has earlier been reported upon. This decrease continued during the 1980s (0.2 per cent) (P less than 0.05). An increase was found in the number of patients operated on who had autopsy-proven pulmonary embolism and who received thromboprophylaxis. Pulmonary embolism continues to be a major cause of death in surgical patients; however, postoperative major pulmonary embolism has shown a reduction in the last 15-year period. 
Improvement by acetylcysteine of hemodynamics and oxygen transport in fulminant hepatic failure. BACKGROUND. When administered early after an overdose of acetaminophen, intravenous acetylcysteine prevents hepatic necrosis by replenishing reduced stores of glutathione. How acetylcysteine improves the survival of patients with established liver damage induced by acetaminophen, however, is unknown. This study was undertaken to determine whether the beneficial effect of acetylcysteine under such circumstances could be due to enhancement of oxygen delivery and consumption. METHODS. We studied the effect of acetylcysteine on systemic hemodynamics and oxygen transport in 12 patients with acetaminophen-induced fulminant hepatic failure and 8 patients with acute liver failure from other causes. The acetylcysteine was given in a dose of 150 mg per kilogram of body weight in 250 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 15 minutes and then in a dose of 50 mg per kilogram in 500 ml of 5 percent dextrose over a period of 4 hours; measurements were made before treatment began and after 30 minutes of the regimen. RESULTS. In the patients with acetaminophen-induced liver failure, the infusion of acetylcysteine resulted in an increase in mean oxygen delivery from 856 to 975 ml per minute per square meter of body-surface area (P = 0.0036), due to an increase in the cardiac index from 5.6 to 6.7 liters per minute per square meter (P = 0.0021). Mean arterial pressure rose from 88 to 95 mm Hg (P = 0.0054) despite a decrease in systemic vascular resistance from 1296 to 1113 dyn.sec.cm-5 per square meter (P = 0.027). There was an increase in oxygen consumption from 127 to 184 ml per minute per square meter (P = 0.0007) associated with an increase in the oxygen-extraction ratio from 16 to 21 percent (P = 0.022). The effects in the patients with acute liver failure from other causes were similar. CONCLUSIONS. The increase in oxygen delivery and consumption in response to acetylcysteine may account for its beneficial effect on survival in patients with fulminant hepatic failure induced by acetaminophen. 
CNS pathology in the neurological mutant rats zitter, tremor and zitter-tremor double mutant (spontaneously epileptic rat, SER). Exaggeration of clinical and neuropathological phenotypes in SER. The pathological alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) were examined in three kinds of mutant rat; the zitter (zi/zi; Zi), the tremor rat (tm/tm; Tm) and the spontaneously epileptic rat (SER) which is a double mutant carrying both zitter and tremor genes. Two major alterations demonstrated in these mutants were hypomyelination and vacuolation or spongy degeneration. Hypomyelination was observed predominantly in SER and to a lesser extent in Zi, and was accompanied by a redundant or aberrant myelin sheath formation in addition to a decreased number of myelinated fibres. This appeared to be related to the occurrence of tremor. There was no abnormality in the structure of the myelin lamellae and oligodendrocytes or any destruction of myelin sheaths by phagocytic cells. The number of radial components in CNS myelin was increased almost equally in Zi, Tm and SER. Vacuolation was prominent in SER and Tm, especially in the brainstem and thalamus. Zi also developed mild vacuolation with advancing age. Vacuolation seemed to be related to the epileptic phenomena in SER and Tm. Vacuoles consisted mainly of swollen astrocytic processes and enlargement of the extracellular space, as well as occasional enlargement of periaxonal spaces. Thus both pathological findings--the hypomyelination derived from the zitter mutation with tremor, and the vacuolation from the tremor mutation with epileptic symptoms--were mutually exaggerated in SER. It is postulated that the two different genetic loci with zi and tm mutations interact and synergistically reinforce each other both clinically and pathologically in SER. 
Etiology of infection and morphologic changes in the lungs of Filipino children who die of pneumonia. Histopathologic studies and isolation of virus and bacteria in culture were carried out for 71 children less than 5 years of age with fatal pneumonia. A potential microbial etiology was identified for 61 children (86%): bacteria for 19 (27%), virus for 16 (23%), and virus plus bacteria for 26 (37%). Staphylococcus was the most prevalent pathogen, alone or in combination with other organisms, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Viral infection may predispose to bacterial infection in some children. A correlation of clinical course, results of cultures, and morphologic changes revealed cofactors that may have contributed to a fatal outcome. Lung abscess, pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, and meningitis were associated with bacterial infection. Many patients in this study had severe bronchopneumonia, with a high prevalence of complications such as abscess (62%), atelectasis (40%), pericarditis (28%), and empyema (7%). Such complications added to multiple infections, measles, and malnutrition contributed to the fatal outcome in these children. 
Cortical dysplasia in temporal lobe epilepsy: magnetic resonance imaging correlations. Cortical dysplasia has been documented in histological specimens surgically removed for treatment of refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. We studied 10 patients with cortical dysplasia and complex partial seizures who underwent temporal lobectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed abnormalities in 5 of the patients who had microscopically detectable major abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an abnormal cortical-white matter architectonic pattern in 2 patients with moderate cortical dysplasia. In the remaining 3 patients, magnetic resonance imaging findings were unremarkable. These observations suggest that magnetic resonance imaging is sensitive in the detection of certain dysplastic lesions in temporal lobe epilepsy. Preoperative identification of these abnormalities by magnetic resonance imaging may permit early and optimal surgical treatment in patients with refractory epilepsy. 
Femoro-femoral or ilio-femoral bypass for unilateral inflow reconstruction? Femoro-femoral and ilio-femoral bypass are two popular options for unilateral inflow reconstruction. In order to evaluate these alternative approaches, the records of 70 consecutive patients who underwent either femoro-femoral (n = 50) or ilio-femoral (n = 22) grafts were retrospectively reviewed. There were 46 men and 24 women, ranging in age from 27 to 84 years (mean: 66 years). Operative mortality was 10% for all femoro-femoral procedures, including 50% for emergent, 14% for synchronous, and 0% for solitary procedures; mortality was 9% for all ilio-femoral grafts including 20% for synchronous and 6% for solitary procedures. Among the elective solitary procedures, there was no significant difference with respect to operative time, blood loss, fluid requirement, time until resuming an oral diet, or duration of postoperative course for the two procedures. Five-year patency was 93% for all ilio-femoral and 57% for all femoro-femoral grafts. Although femoro-femoral bypass has been the more popular option for unilateral inflow reconstruction in this and other institutions, these findings justify the more widespread use of ilio-femoral bypass. 
Cloning and expression of the human vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a neuroendocrine mediator found in the central and peripheral nervous system. Distinct subsets of neural, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and immune cells bear specific high-affinity receptors for VIP, which are associated with a guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein capable of activating adenylate cyclase. A cDNA clone (GPRN1) encoding the human VIP receptor was identified in libraries prepared from the Nalm 6 line of leukemic pre-B lymphoblasts and the HT-29 line of colon carcinoma cells. The deduced 362-amino acid polypeptide sequence encoded by GPRN1 shares a seven-transmembrane-segment hydropathicity profile with other G protein-coupled receptors. Northern blot analyses identified a 2.7-kilobase transcript of the VIP receptor in Nalm 6 and HT-29 cells as well as in tissues from rat brain, colon, heart, lung, kidney, spleen, and small intestine. COS-6 cells transfected with GPRN1 bound 125I-labeled VIP specifically with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 2.5 nM. VIP--and less effectively secretin, peptide histidine isoleucine (PHI), and glucagon competitively displaced bound 125I-VIP from transfected COS-6 cells, with potencies in the order VIP greater than secretin = PHI much greater than glucagon. VIP stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells, inducing a 3-fold increase in the intracellular level of cAMP. When the antisense orientation of the VIP receptor clone was introduced into HT-29 cells, there was a 50% suppression of the specific binding of 125I-VIP and of the VIP-induced increase in cAMP level, relative to untransfected cells. The VIP receptor cloned exhibits less than or equal to 24% homology with other receptors in the same superfamily and thus represents a subset of G protein-coupled receptors for peptide ligands. 
Acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas: a rare cause of left-sided portal hypertension. Isolated splenic vein obstruction with left-sided portal hypertension is a rare clinical condition. Owing to the close relationship of the splenic vein and the pancreas, this rare phenomenon is usually secondary to pancreatic inflammation or neoplasm. Acinar cell carcinoma has long been recognized as a distinctive, rare type of pancreatic carcinoma. A case of isolated splenic vein obstruction with left-sided portal hypertension secondary to acinar cell carcinoma of the pancreas, which we are reporting here, is thought to the first documented in the literature. 
Incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer in New Hampshire and Vermont. A survey of skin cancer occurrence between June 1979 and May 1980 among residents of New Hampshire and Vermont identified 277 cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 1761 cases of basal cell carcinoma. The age-adjusted incidence rates for squamous cell carcinoma (32 per 100,000 in men, 8 per 100,000 in women) and for basal cell carcinoma (159 per 100,000 in men, 87 per 100,000 in women) were similar to those reported in other populations in the northern United States. Skin cancer incidence was particularly high among men more than 70 years of age and a large proportion (greater than 30%) of patients 55 years or older had a history of at least one previous skin cancer. 
Clinical and biologic features of childhood T-cell leukemia with the t(11;14). Cytogenetic analysis of cells from 622 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and successful G-banding chromosome studies disclosed seven cases with the t(11;14)(p13;q11) and one with the t(11;14)(p15;q11). Leukemia cells in all eight cases had a T-cell immunophenotype. The t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurred in 6.8% and the t(11;14)(p15;q11) in 1% of T-cell ALL cases (n = 103). The t(11;14) was associated with presenting clinical features typical of T-cell ALL: male predominance (n = 6), age greater than 10 years (n = 3), hyperleukocytosis (white blood cells greater than 100 x 10(9)/L, n = 5), relatively high hemoglobin level (median, 10.8 g/dL), high serum lactic dehydrogenase level (median, 3248 U/L), presence of mediastinal mass (n = 6), and central nervous system leukemia (n = 2). While there were no significant differences in presenting features between T-cell ALL cases with or without the t(11;14), leukemic cells from patients with the translocations were more likely to coexpress CD4 and CD8 antigens (6 of 6 v 35 of 86 cases tested, P less than .05). Adverse events have occurred in six patients: three central nervous system relapses [including the one with t(11;14)(p15;q11)], two secondary acute myeloid leukemia, and one hematologic relapse. Our results indicate that the t(11;14)(p13;q11) occurs exclusively in T-cell malignancies of intermediate- or late-stage thymocyte differentiation. Additional studies are needed to determine the prognostic implications of these translocations. 
Impaired binding properties of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease. To determine the factors underlying the apparent reduction in binding ability of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma, hormone-binding characteristics were further examined in patients with this disease and in control subjects. No differences in affinity constants with respect to triodothyronine or serum thyroxine-binding globulin from hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhotic and normal subjects were found. The affinity for thyroxine was significantly reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.41 +/- 0.13 x 10(10) mol-1) and cirrhotic (0.65 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) mol-1) patients compared with normal subjects (0.94 +/- 0.7 x 10(10) mol-1). Investigations carried out on liver tissue obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease showed that thyroxine-binding globulin within tumor tissue was elevated and bound less exogenous tracer hormone compared with that obtained from nontumor tissue. Tumor-derived thyroxine-binding globulin with altered binding properties is, at least partly, responsible for the abnormal behavior of the serum protein in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Parenchymal versus reticuloendothelial iron overload in the liver: distinction with MR imaging Parenchymal iron deposition occurs in hemochromatosis, while iron is deposited in reticuloendothelial (RE) cells after blood transfusions or rhabdomyolysis. Magnetic resonance images of patients with decreased liver signal intensity on T2-weighted images at 1.5 T were blindly compared in an effort to distinguish these conditions. In each of five patients with hemochromatosis, the pancreas had low signal intensity, but splenic signal intensity was decreased in only one. In contrast, only three of the 16 patients with RE iron overload had low pancreatic signal intensity, while all of these patients either had low splenic signal intensity (n = 14) or previously underwent splenectomy (n = 2). Distinction among these causes of iron deposition is clinically important because parenchymal iron overload from hemochromatosis may produce significant tissue damage, while the RE iron of transfusions and rhabdomyolysis is of little clinical consequence. 
Long-term follow-up of elderly patients with locoregional breast cancer treated with tamoxifen only. One hundred and thirteen women aged 70 years or more with locoregional breast cancer were treated with tamoxifen alone as primary treatment. They were followed for a minimum of 5 years. Complete response occurred in 38 women, partial response in 17, no change in 34 and progressive disease in 24. Where progressive disease occurred, or where patients relapsed after an initial response, the most suitable conventional therapy was given. The actuarial 5-year survival rate was 49.4 per cent for all patients and was much higher (92 per cent) in those showing an initial complete response. Seventy patients (61.9 per cent) were not controlled by tamoxifen alone to death or most recent follow-up. Tamoxifen provides an alternative treatment for operable breast cancer in older women in the short term and may be particularly suitable for those with concurrent disease or who are unwilling to undergo surgery. The low morbidity rate from tamoxifen must be balanced against the need to maintain close follow-up. In the medium to long term, sole primary treatment by tamoxifen delays more definitive therapy. 
Stability of ethnic differences in children's pressor responses during three annual examinations. In this study, 395 healthy children had blood pressure and heart rate measured both at rest and during a stressful video game. Identical measurement procedures were used for three annual examinations. Consistently, black children demonstrated significantly greater pressor responses than white children. In view of the greater prevalence of hypertension among black adults than white adults, these data suggest that blacks exhibit hemodynamic irregularities well before the onset or diagnosis of hypertension. 
Adrenoceptors on blood cells from patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon. 1. alpha 2-Adrenoceptors on platelet membranes and beta 2-adrenoceptors on lymphocytes were studied in 24 patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and in 24 age- and sex-matched control subjects. In two subgroups, a standardized mental arithmetic test and a finger-cooling test were performed. 2. Baseline blood pressure, heart rate and forearm blood flow did not differ between the two groups. 3. Baseline skin microcirculation (laser Doppler flux) was decreased in primary Raynaud's phenomenon (19 +/- 15 arbitrary units) compared with control subjects (33 +/- 14 arbitrary units) (P less than 0.01). 4. Baseline plasma noradrenaline concentration (2.00 +/- 1.44 versus 1.16 +/- 0.36 nmol/l) and alpha 2-adrenoceptor density (301 +/- 119 versus 210 +/- 82 fmol/mg) were increased in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon in comparison with the control subjects. The alpha 2-adrenoceptor density/beta 2-adrenoceptor density ratio in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon was, with a value of 0.37 +/- 0.04, higher than in the control subjects, where a value of 0.25 +/- 0.02 was measured (P less than 0.001). Plasma adrenaline concentration, beta 2-adrenoceptor density and the antagonist affinity to both receptor subtypes did not differ between both groups under baseline conditions. 5. Whereas during the finger-cooling test no differences were seen in the responses of the parameters measured, the mental arithmetic test induced an increase in laser Doppler flux in patients with primary Raynaud's phenomenon and a decrease in the control group. 
Variation in management based on type of choledochal cyst. The management of 23 patients treated for choledochal cysts at the Oregon Health Sciences University between 1969 and 1990 is reviewed. The median age was 27 years, with a range from 1 month to 90 years. Seventy-eight percent of patients presented with abdominal pain, and 35% were jaundiced. Three patients presented with cholangitis, two with cyst rupture, and one with recurrent pancreatitis. Nine patients had had previous biliary surgery. The diagnosis was made in all patients with ultrasound and/or cholangiography. Fifteen patients (65%) had type I cysts, 2 had a type II cyst, 5 (22%) had type III cysts, and 1 had a type IV cyst. Stones were present in four (17%) cysts, and all excised cysts were benign. Seventeen patients with type I and II choledochal cysts had complete cyst excision and choledochoenterostomy. Four of five patients with type III cysts had endoscopic cyst incision and drainage, while the fifth patient had transduodenal cyst excision and sphincteroplasty. The patient with a type IV cyst had extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy. There were no operative deaths. Two postoperative complications occurred: cholangitis and a prolonged ileus. All patients had resolution of their pain and jaundice. Two patients had late cholangitis. Cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy are the treatment of choice for types I and II choledochal cysts. Extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy may be adequate treatment for type IV cysts. Endoscopic incision and drainage is appropriate for selected patients with type III cysts. 
Characterization of infectious crystalline keratitis caused by a human isolate of Streptococcus mitis. Streptococcus mitis isolated from a human with infectious crystalline keratitis was injected intrastromally into corneas of adult New Zealand white rabbits that were treated with tetracycline hydrochloride, methylprednisolone acetate, or a combination of tetracycline and methylprednisolone. Animals were followed up for up to 44 days; untreated corneas and those treated with tetracycline developed no disease or "fluffy" stromal infiltrates with overlying epithelial defects representing an abscess. Corneas treated with the combination of tetracycline and corticosteroid usually developed crystalline stromal opacities that on histopathologic examination were shown to be intrastromal aggregates of cocci. Transmission electron microscopy of crystalline lesions within 10 days of infection revealed typical cocci intermixed with a fibrillar material having periodicity characteristic of fibrinogen or fibrin, and immunoperoxidase staining for fibrinogen was positive. By 1 month, electron microscopy revealed aggregates of degenerated bacteria that were surrounded by cellular processes of activated keratocytes. Our studies demonstrate a model for crystalline keratitis in which organisms are seen to reside within the stroma for up to 44 days without an inflammatory response. Periocular corticosteroids appear to be necessary to create this model. It is possible that the organisms are isolated from the host response by fibrin or by keratocytes. 
Application of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in infants and small children. Intraoperative echocardiography is gaining increasing acceptance in the assessment of the surgical repair of congenital heart defects. Because of its ideal imaging location, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has been especially helpful in evaluating pulmonary venous return and the integrity of the left atrioventricular valve following mitral valvuloplasty, complete atrioventricular valve repair and correction of complex congenital heart disease. It has not been routinely used in infants and small children because of a prohibitively large probe size. We report the successful use of a recently developed "pediatric" TEE probe capable of Doppler and color flow imaging in two patients less than 7 years of age. No complications were encountered. Recommendations regarding optimal probe imaging positions in infants are provided. 
Current treatment of patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Most out-of-hospital cardiac arrests result from the sudden onset of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia in the absence of a new myocardial infarction. Individuals who survive cardiac arrest are at high risk for recurrent arrhythmias and sudden unexpected death. To prevent recurrent cardiac arrest, effective treatment must be provided during hospitalization after the initial episode. Caring for the survivor of cardiac arrest requires a detailed clinical investigation to define the underlying cardiac anatomy and left ventricular function and to elucidate the mechanism and characteristics of the patient's arrhythmia. Appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy, such as drugs or a nonpharmacological intervention (eg, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), is then selected based on these considerations. In addition, ischemia is treated aggressively with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and, when appropriate, with surgical coronary artery revascularization. 
Tissue polypeptide antigen activity in cerebrospinal fluid: a marker of central nervous system metastases of breast cancer. Tissue polypeptide antigen (TPpA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was measured in 59 consecutive breast cancer patients with suspected central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subsequently, we determined that 13 patients had parenchymal brain metastases, 10 had leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, and 36 had no CNS involvement. The concentration of TPpA, which is a nonspecific marker for cell proliferation, was significantly higher in patients with CNS metastases than in those without it (P less than .0001; Mann-Whitney test). A tentative cutoff value for CNS metastases was set at 95 U/L TPpA; the upper limit of values indicating absence of CNS metastases was 89 U/L. Given these cutoff points, the sensitivity of TPpA as a marker for CNS metastases was 74% and the specificity was 100%; the predictive values of positive and negative tests were 100% and 86%, respectively. In 16 patients with CNS metastases, no correlation was found between TPpA activity in corresponding CSF and blood samples (correlation coefficient, Spearman's rho = .4; P greater than .1). In three patients treated for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the measurements of CSF TPpA showed correlation between the presence of tumor cells in the CSF and neurological clinical function. TPpA concentrations decreased in parallel with the clinical response and increased prior to CNS disease progression. As a marker for CNS metastases, the level of TPpA in the CSF in breast cancer patients appears to be superior to the level of protein, lactate dehydrogenase, or glucose, which showed very low sensitivity (41%, 47%, and 8%, respectively). For quantitative evaluation of treatment for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis, the TPpA level appears to be valuable and superior to CSF cytology, because tumor cells are not always present in CSF samples from patients with this condition. 
Roles of thrombin and platelet membrane glycoprotein IIb/IIIa in platelet-subendothelial deposition after angioplasty in an ex vivo whole artery model. BACKGROUND. Platelet deposition at the site of injury caused by balloon angioplasty is associated with acute closure and restenosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. In a new ex vivo whole artery angioplasty model, we examined the roles of thrombin inhibition with D-Phe-Pro-ArgCH2Cl (PPACK) and inhibition of the platelet membrane fibrinogen receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) with monoclonal antibody 7E3 on platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury. Fresh rabbit aortas were mounted in a perfusion chamber. One half of the mounted arterial segment was dilated with a standard angioplasty balloon catheter and the uninjured half served as the control segment. The vessels were perfused with human blood at physiological pressure and shear rates of 180-250 second-1 for 30 minutes. Platelet deposition was measured using 111In-labeled platelets and scanning electron microscopy. With heparin (2 units/ml) anticoagulation, 8.2 +/- 2.2 x 10(6) platelets/cm2 were deposited at the site of balloon injury compared with 0.7 +/- 0.2 x 10(6) platelets/cm2 on uninjured segments (p less than 0.02, n = 7). PPACK was tested at a concentration (10 microM) that totally inhibited platelet aggregation in response to thrombin. 7E3 was tested at a concentration (10 micrograms/ml) that totally inhibited platelet aggregation. Platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury was reduced 47% by PPACK and 70% by 7E3 compared with heparin. CONCLUSIONS. At shear rates seen in nonstenotic coronary arteries, PPACK and 7E3 are more effective than heparin in reducing platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury. The significant inhibition of platelet deposition by PPACK demonstrates the importance of heparin-resistant thrombin in platelet thrombus formation. The 7E3 results suggest that approximately 70% of platelet deposition at the site of balloon injury is GPIIb/IIIa dependent and that the remaining 30% results from non-GPIIb/IIIa-mediated platelet-subendothelial adhesion. Finally, the ex vivo whole artery system is a useful model for studying platelet-vessel wall interactions under physiologically defined parameters. 
Mycotic (Aspergillus) arteritis resulting in fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a case report. A seventy-one year-old Japanese man suffering from carcinoma of the common bile duct died from subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary in intracranial mycotic arteritis (MA). Repeated cultures of the discharge from the draining tubes, the tip of intravenous hyperalimentation catheters, blood, sputum, and urine failed to grow any fungus. Autopsy disclosed MA due to Aspergillus at the terminal portion of the right internal carotid artery close to the posterior communicating artery. 
Inhibitory effect of interleukin-4 on the in vitro growth of Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. We investigated the effect of recombinant human interleukin-4 (rhIL-4) on the in vitro growth of human leukemia cells in liquid culture and 3H-thymidine incorporation and found inhibitory effects on the growth of leukemic cells from patients with Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph1 ALL) and three Ph1 ALL cell lines. However, no inhibitory effects were seen in Ph1-positive leukemic cell lines derived from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis and various types of Ph1-negative leukemia cells, including B-lineage leukemia cells. In a flow cytometry assay of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), all three Ph1-positive ALL cell lines showed the presence of IL-4R on their cell surfaces, and the IL-4-dependent inhibition on the growth of Ph1-positive ALL cells was abrogated by the addition of either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against rhIL-4. Other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-CSF, and IL-6, showed no inhibitory effects on the growth of Ph1-ALL cells, but tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN)-alpha, -beta, and -gamma displayed slight inhibitory effects in a high concentration. The growth inhibition induced by rhIL-4 in the Ph1-positive ALL cells was not abrogated by the addition of antibodies against either IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha. Furthermore, these cells showed no significant production of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma or TNF-alpha after exposure to rhIL-4, thus indicating that the growth inhibition of Ph1-positive ALL cells by rhIL-4 is not associated with IL-4-stimulating production of these factors. rhIL-4 caused significant inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity in these Ph1-positive ALL cells, similar to Herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase that inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity in these cells. Our finding suggests that the clinical evaluation of rhIL-4 may offer promising therapeutic possibilities for patients with Ph1-positive ALL. 
Aztreonam vs. cefotaxime in the treatment of gram-negative spontaneous peritonitis in cirrhotic patients. Aztreonam and cefotaxime were compared in 44 cirrhotic patients who had 52 episodes of gram-negative spontaneous peritonitis. Patients were randomized into two therapeutic groups of similar characteristics. Group A (28 episodes) received 0.5 gm of aztreonam every 8 hr, and group B (24 episodes) received 1 gm of cefotaxime every 6 hr, for a planned 14-day period. Peak and trough serum and ascitic fluid levels of both antibiotics were several times higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations of causative microorganisms. Eleven patients (21%) died within the first 48 hr after beginning therapy, which included seven in the aztreonam group and four in the cefotaxime group. In the remaining patients, signs and symptoms of infection were promptly controlled, and ascitic fluid cultures became negative after 48 hr in all cases, except in one patient from the aztreonam group, who was a clinical failure. Two patients from the aztreonam group and one from the cefotaxime group relapsed after treatment. The overall mortality rate was 50%, which was lower than classically reported: 12 patients (43%) died in the aztreonam group, and 14 (58%) died in the cefotaxime group (p = 0.265, NS). Hepatorenal syndrome and digestive tract hemorrhage were the most frequent causes of death occurring after the first 48 hr of treatment. Streptococcal superinfections developed in three patients (14.2%) in the aztreonam group. We conclude that both antibiotics at the low doses used in this study are similarly well tolerated and effective in controlling this infection. Because the use of aztreonam as the initial empirical treatment requires a concomitant antibiotic against gram-positive infections and the possibility of streptococcal superinfections, cefotaxime seems to be a more advantageous therapeutic alternative for this patient population. 
Effects of posture, Valsalva maneuver and respiration on atrial flutter rate: an effect mediated through cardiac volume. The effects of passive upright tilting from 0 degrees to +60 degrees (n = 27), Valsalva maneuver (n = 16) and respiration (n = 10) on the rate of atrial flutter were studied in 27 patients. After tilting to +60 degrees, the atrial flutter cycle length shortened in all patients from 247.5 +/- 7 to 236.7 +/- 6.9 ms (range of shortening 1 to 21 ms, p less than 0.001). The Valsalva maneuver (strain of 40 mm Hg) shortened the flutter cycle length during the strain (phase 2) from 242.2 +/- 4.6 to 230.5 +/- 5 ms (range of shortening 2 to 19 ms, p less than 0.001). In 10 patients whose respiration was monitored, the flutter cycle length consistently prolonged during inspiration and shortened during expiration. Combined beta-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor blockade in six patients did not significantly alter the flutter cycle length at rest or the effects of the various maneuvers on the changes in flutter cycle length. This study revealed that the atrial flutter cycle length can be shortened by passive upright tilting, the strain phase of the Valsalva maneuver and expiration. Changes in flutter cycle length were independent of autonomic tone, implying that by decreasing cardiac volume, these maneuvers affect characteristics of the atrial flutter circuit, thereby producing dynamic changes in the rate of atrial flutter. 
Two cases of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with myelopathy. We describe two patients with autopsy-proven neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) presenting only as a transverse myelopathy for 10 to 12 months, followed by disseminated intracranial manifestations. Postmortem examination disclosed a vasculocentric distribution of neoplastic cells in various organs that stained positively with B-lymphocyte-specific monoclonal antibody. These cases were unusual because they manifested as an isolated myelopathy for many months. 
DNA ploidy and cell kinetic measurements as predictors of recurrence and survival in stages B2 and C colorectal adenocarcinoma. DNA content and cell proliferation were measured by flow cytometry on paraffin-embedded Stage B2 or C colorectal adenocarcinomas from 694 patients enrolled in adjuvant trials conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Patients with diploid tumors had a higher survival rate than those with nondiploid tumors (P less than 0.001). The proliferation index (the sum of the percent of cells in S-phase plus those in G2M phase) was also a strong prognostic factor (P less than 0.001). The ploidy and proliferation data were combined, and the patients in the favorable group (diploid and low proliferative index) had a 5-year survival of 74% compared with 54% for the unfavorable group (high proliferative index or nondiploid, P less than 0.001). This grouping was prognostic for survival in B2 (P less than 0.001), C (P = 0.013), colon (P less than 0.001), and rectal (P = 0.026) patient subsets. This study indicates that cell kinetic parameters are important and independent prognostic factors for Stages B2 and C colorectal cancer. 
Poststenotic dilatation. Partial narrowing of arteries produces poststenotic dilatation. This appears as a dilation of the vessel wall 1 to 3 centimeters distal to the area of a partial stenosis. When a stenotic band is placed in dogs, poststenotic dilatation develops rapidly, often within eight to ten days. Moderate stenoses that produce a bruit and thrill are effective in eliciting poststenotic dilatation, whereas very tight and very mild stenoses usually are ineffective. Thus, development of poststenotic dilatation requires the presence of flow disturbances sufficient to produce an audible bruit and a palpable thrill. Although the exact flow disturbance is uncertain, statis, increased lateral pressure, cavitation, abnormal shear stresses and turbulence all have been postulated to be the cause of poststenotic dilatation. Of these, experimental studies support abnormal shear stresses and turbulence as the most likely causes. Whatever the flow disturbance, it must make the wall vibrate to produce poststenotic dilatation. Vibrations are thought to produce alterations in wall elastin and possibly in vascular smooth muscle tone. This leads to dilatation of the vessel. If the dilatation is slight, removal of the stenosis may cause reversal of poststenotic dilatation with recovery beginning within hours of correction of the stenosis. If the dilated area is enlarged to twice normal diameter, it may exhibit permanent aneurysmal changes and, therefore, requires resections with reanastomosis. Arteries that are dilated to as little as one-third more than normal size may contain areas of ulceration with overlying thrombus. These vessels also may require resection with reanastomosis. 
The effects of shoes on the torsion and rearfoot motion in running. Excessive pronation is accepted as a good indicator for various running injuries. The least amount of pronation takes place when running barefoot. The latest investigations show that this is connected to a large torsional movement between forefoot and rearfoot which can be influenced by the shoe sole construction. The shoes which are in use among runners in track and field are basically of two types, running shoes (in general torsionally stiff) and spikes (torsionally flexible). The possibly varying effect of these shoes on the shoe/foot motion in running is not known. The purpose of this investigation was therefore to show whether the pronation angle and the torsion angle differ when running barefoot, with spikes, and with running shoes (forefoot touchdown, N = 9 left and right). A film analysis provided the angular movements of the lower leg, rearfoot, and forefoot as well as pronation and torsion in the frontal plane. The results show that at touchdown the torsional movements with both shoe types are quite different from those of running barefoot. With shoes, the torsion angle is reduced back to zero--with running shoes more than with spikes--and the pronation angle is increased beyond the barefoot values (P less than 0.01). In order to reduce the risk of injury, both shoe types should be improved--the running shoes with respect to torsion and the spikes with respect to pronation. 
Immunohistochemical studies of blood group-related antigens in human superficial esophageal carcinomas. A total of 63 surgically resected esophageal carcinomas (including 49 superficial esophageal carcinomas) and histologically normal tissue adjacent to the superficial carcinoma (nontumorous epithelium) were examined immunohistochemically for the blood group antigens (BGA) A, B, H, Lewisa, Lewisb, Lewisx, and Lewisy. Deletion of an expected A, B or H antigen occurred in 12 (24.5%) of the 49 superficial carcinomas and three (21.4%) of the 14 advanced carcinomas. Incompatible expression of an unexpected A or B antigens occurred in only one case (1.6%) in the carcinoma. In the clinicopathologic study, there was a significant correlation between immunoreactivity of Lewisa and depth of cancer invasion (chi-square test, P less than 0.05). In the superficial carcinoma, there were significant correlations between immunoreactivity of Lewisx and lymph node status (chi-square test, P less than 0.05), immunoreactivity of Lewisy and prognosis (Z test, P less than 0.05), and incompatible expression of Lewisb for tumor against nontumorous epithelium and histologic variation (chi-square test, P less than 0.01). The functional significance of alternations in BGA expression that may be associated with oncogenesis is not clear. However, immunohistochemical determination of BGA may be a more advantageous marker to predict the patient's clinical course in superficial esophageal carcinoma. 
Extraadrenal retroperitoneal paraganglioma: clinical, pathologic, and CT findings. Paragangliomas of the retroperitoneum arise from specialized neural crest cells distributed along the aorta in association with the sympathetic chain. In order to ascertain characteristic CT features of extraadrenal retroperitoneal paragangliomas to differentiate them from other retroperitoneal tumors, 31 discrete tumors and two cases of paragangliomatosis in 28 patients were reviewed retrospectively, and the CT features were correlated with clinical and pathologic findings. There were 16 men and 12 women. Average age was 37 years (range, 11-70 years). Twenty-four patients (86%) had hypertension. Of these, catecholamine levels were elevated in all 18 patients who had biochemical studies. Four patients (14%) had malignant paragangliomas. The discrete tumors were classified by location as suprarenal (26%), renal hilar (32%), or infrarenal (42%). Suprarenal paragangliomas could not be distinguished from the ipsilateral adrenal gland on CT. The average size of functional tumors was smaller (7.0 cm) than that of nonfunctional tumors (12.0 cm), but the sizes of the two groups overlapped. Smaller tumors were more likely to be homogeneous and have well-defined margins than were larger tumors. Our findings indicate that extraadrenal retroperitoneal paragangliomas are functionally active more often than previously reported and that they are readily detected by CT as soft-tissue masses closely associated with the entire length of the abdominal aorta. However, no CT feature was found that was unique for paraganglioma. 
Upbeat and downbeat nystagmus occurring successively in a patient with posterior medullary haemorrhage. In a patient with posterior medullary haemorrhage, first upbeat and later downbeat nystagmus occurred in the primary position. The lesion was limited to the posterior and medial part of the medulla. Clinical and electro-oculographic examination first showed upbeat nystagmus in the primary position and upgaze, with downbeat nystagmus in downgaze. Two and a half months later, there was downbeat nystagmus in the primary position and downgaze and upbeat nystagmus in upgaze. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of choroidal melanoma with and without gadolinium contrast enhancement. Choroidal melanoma is the most common intraocular tumor and is uniquely suited for evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of the paramagnetic effect of the melanin molecule. The authors performed T1-, T2-, and proton-density-weighted MRI on 34 patients with choroidal melanoma. Nineteen patients received gadolinium contrast, T1-weighted images were superior in both detecting and delineating tumors, showing increased contrast-to-noise ratios over other images. Gadolinium contrast further increased this ratio. These images are presented as evidence that gadolinium-enhanced MRI is valuable in the evaluation of choroidal melanoma. 
Comparison of standard external CPR, open-chest CPR, and cardiopulmonary bypass in a canine myocardial infarct model. STUDY OBJECTIVES: After cardiac arrest, open-chest CPR (OCCPR) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have demonstrated higher resuscitation rates when compared individually with standard external CPR (SECPR). We compared all three techniques in a canine myocardial infarct ventricular fibrillation model. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six mongrel dogs were block-randomized to receive SECPR and advanced life support (nine), CPB (nine), or OCCPR (eight). DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: All dogs received left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by four minutes of ventricular fibrillation without CPR and eight minutes of Thumper CPR. At 12 minutes, dogs received one of three resuscitation techniques. After resuscitation, all animals received four hours of intensive care. Animals that were resuscitated had histochemical determination of ischemic and necrotic myocardial areas. MEASUREMENTS: Intravascular pressures were measured and coronary perfusion pressure was calculated during baseline, cardiac arrest, resuscitation, and postresuscitation periods. Percent necrotic myocardium, percent ischemic myocardium, and necrotic-to-ischemic ratios were determined for resuscitated animals. Epinephrine dosage and number of countershocks were determined for each group. MAIN RESULTS: Nine of nine CPB and six of nine OCCPR, compared with two of eight SECPR animals, were resuscitated (P less than .01). Three of nine CPB and OCCPR and two of eight SECPR dogs survived to four hours (P = NS). Coronary perfusion pressure two minutes after institution of technique was significantly higher with CPB (75 +/- 37 mm Hg) and OCCPR (56 +/- 31 mm Hg) than in SECPR animals (16 +/- 16 mm Hg, P less than .04). Epinephrine required for resuscitation was significantly less with CPB (0.10 +/- 0.02 mg/kg) than for SECPR (0.28 +/- 0.11 mg/kg, P less than .002). The ratio of necrotic to ischemic myocardium at four hours was significantly lower with CPB (0.15 +/- 0.31) and OCCPR (0.39 +/- 0.25) than for SECPR (1.16 +/- 0.31, P less than .02). CONCLUSION: OCCPR and CPB produce higher coronary perfusion pressures and improved resuscitation rates from ventricular fibrillation when compared with SECPR in this canine myocardial infarct cardiac arrest model. CPB and OCCPR yielded similar resuscitation results, although less epinephrine was required with CPB. 
Indices of reperfusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction using characteristics of the CK-MB time-activity curve. The purpose of this study was to identify indices of coronary artery reperfusion in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by means of characteristics from the serum creatine kinase (CK) isoenzyme MB time-activity curve. Frequent blood sampling as performed in three groups with a first AMI: 29 patients treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy who had a patent infarct-related artery with normal flow (TIMI-3) at acute catheterization (reperfusion group); four patients with a persistently closed infarct-related artery (no reperfusion group); and 44 patients who did not receive any therapy aimed at coronary reperfusion (no thrombolytic therapy group). In the latter group we prospectively estimated that 25% would have spontaneous reperfusion. A physiologically based computer-calculated multi-compartment method was used to determine the characteristics of the serum CK-MB time-activity curve. In addition to demonstrating an earlier increase, a shorter time to peak of serum CK-MB and a lower estimated infarct size in the reperfusion group (p = 0.025 to 0.00001), the appearance rate constant (k1) and time from estimated initial increase to peak of CK-MB in the blood stream (tRP) were significantly different from those values in the no thrombolytic therapy group (p less than 00001). A cutoff level indicating reperfusion if k1 was greater than 0.185 or tRP was less than 16.5 hours demonstrated overlapping values between these two groups in only four patients (k1), two patients (tRP), and six patients with a combination. 
Ruptured interstitial pregnancy presenting as an intrauterine pregnancy by ultrasound. Interstitial pregnancy is an uncommon subset of ectopic pregnancy in which the conceptum implants in the intrauterine portion of the fallopian tube. These pregnancies tend to progress further before rupture than do other tubal pregnancies and subsequently have greater propensity for massive intra-abdominal bleeding and maternal demise. Abdominal ultrasound can be deceptive in evaluating interstitial ectopic pregnancies. Transvaginal ultrasonography is more sensitive in the diagnosis of early ectopic pregnancy. Knowledge of the application and limitations of both transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound will assist the emergency physician in the timely evaluation of this potentially lethal condition. 
Carcinoma of the prostate: value of transrectal sonography in detecting extension into the neurovascular bundle. Detection of involvement of the neurovascular bundles (NVB) by tumor is important in deciding whether sexual function can be preserved in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy for prostatic cancer. The nerve branches innervating the corpora cavernosa have a rather constant association with the capsular arteries and veins of the prostate, forming the periprostatic neurovascular bundle, which can be identified intraoperatively and spared during radical surgery, thus preserving potency. We examined 160 patients with biopsy-proved clinical stage A or B adenocarcinoma with transrectal sonography before radical prostatectomy to determine how useful the procedure is for predicting tumor extension into the NVB. Correlation with pathologic serial sections was obtained in each patient. The sonograms depicted the NVB on both sides in 77 patients (50%), on the right side only in 13 (8%), and on the left side only in 36 patients (23%). In 29 patients (19%) neither neurovascular bundle could be identified on the sonograms. Ninety-one tumors in this series showed evidence of extraglandular spread pathologically, which was posterolateral or into the NVB in 70 tumors involving 82 hemispheres. Using transrectal sonography, we correctly identified invasion of the NVB in 54 cases and missed it in 28 cases. NVB invasion was predicted incorrectly with transrectal sonography in 51 cases; absence of involvement of the NVB was correctly predicted in 177 hemispheres. The sensitivity of sonography for predicting invasion of the NVB was 66%, with a specificity of 78% and an accuracy of 75%. Positive predictive values and negative predictive values were 51% and 86%, respectively. We conclude that transrectal sonography currently suffers from lack of sufficient spatial resolution to detect accurately invasion of the NVB. 
C4b-binding protein exacerbates the host response to Escherichia coli. Activated protein C is a plasma anticoagulant. For activated protein C to function as an anticoagulant, it must form a complex with protein S. Protein S anticoagulant activity is neutralized by formation of a reversible complex with C4b binding protein (C4bBP). C4bBP is an acute-phase plasma protein. When C4bBP levels increase, mass action forces the level of free protein S to decrease, giving rise to an acquired functional protein S deficiency. It has been proposed that these elevated C4bBP levels and the resultant acquired deficiency of protein S that occurs in inflammation could contribute to a hypercoagulable state. An experimental model to test this hypothesis was suggested by our previous studies that demonstrated that inhibition of protein C activation rendered baboons hypercoagulable in response to sublethal Escherichia coli infusion (J Clin Invest 79:918, 1987). We have extended these studies to examine the effect of inhibition of protein S activity with C4bBP in the host (baboon) response to infusion of sublethal concentrations of E coli organisms. Five sets of animals were studied: (1) those challenged with sublethal concentrations of E coli alone (0.4 x 10(10)/kg); (2) those supplemented only with C4bBP (20 mg/kg); (3) those challenged with the same level of E coli but supplemented with C4bBP (20 mg/kg); (4) those challenged with sublethal E coli and supplemented with C4bBP (20 mg/kg) and sufficient protein S (2.3 mg/kg) to fill the protein S binding sites on C4bBP; and (5) those challenged with lethal concentrations of E coli. Sublethal E coli infusion (group 1 animals) caused only an acute-phase response with no consumption of fibrinogen, detectable organ damage, or detectable tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in the plasma. C4bBP infusion (group 2 animals) resulted in no significant physiologic changes, no detectable plasma TNF, and little change in fibrinogen level. The group 3 animals, receiving both sublethal E coli and C4bBP, exhibited rapid consumption of fibrinogen, systemic organ damage, and detectable circulating TNF ultimately leading to death. The overall response of this group was very similar to the response of the group 5 animals receiving an LD100 dose of E coli. The group 4 animals, which were treated exactly as above except that C4bBP was supplemented with a slight excess of protein S, responded essentially like those that received sublethal E coli alone. These studies suggest that the elevation of C4bBP during an inflammatory response can contribute to fibrinogen consumption and vascular damage. This vascular damage may be associated with enhanced elaboration of cytokines like TNF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Functional recovery after traumatic transtentorial herniation. To elucidate the factors associated with functional recovery after traumatic transtentorial herniation, we reviewed the records of 153 consecutive patients admitted with clinical signs of transtentorial herniation (altered level of consciousness, anisocoria or pupillary unresponsiveness, and abnormal motor findings). Overall, 28 patients (18%) had a functional outcome: 14 patients (9%) made a good recovery and 14 were moderately disabled. Sixteen patients (10.5%) were severely disabled or vegetative, and 104 (60%) died. Compared with patients who died or were left severely disabled or vegetative, patients who had a good recovery were younger (21 versus 38 years), were significantly more likely to be children (less than or equal to 17 years old) and have anisocoria and a deteriorating Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and were significantly less likely to be flaccid or have bilaterally fixed pupils; moderately disabled patients also had a lower median age and a higher frequency of anisocoria. There was no difference in the incidence of significant intracranial hematomas between patients with a functional outcome and those with a nonfunctional outcome. Twenty-seven percent of the 95 patients with anisocoria had a good outcome or moderate disability, whereas only 3.5% of the 58 patients with bilaterally fixed and dilated pupils at admission had a functional recovery (P less than 0.05). Age, level of consciousness, and the degree of residual upper brain stem function at admission appear to be the most important determinants of functional outcome after traumatic transtentorial herniation. 
Idiopathic and L-tryptophan-associated eosinophilic fasciitis before and after L-tryptophan contamination. Recently, a causative association has been made between the ingestion of levotryptophan (L-tryptophan) and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS), a new entity manifested by peripheral blood eosinophilia, myalgias, constitutional symptoms, and cutaneous edema with fibrosis. Contaminated levotryptophan preparations produced at a single manufacturing company between October 1988 and June 1989 have been implicated in all EMS cases. In this study, we analyzed retrospectively 49 patients with cutaneous fibrosis for a history of levotryptophan use. Levotryptophan ingestion prior to the onset of their disease was reported by 11 (65%) of 17 patients with eosinophilic fascilitis (EF), two (20%) of 10 patients with localized scleroderma, and none of 22 patients with systemic sclerosis. The onset of levotryptophan-associated cutaneous disease preceded the availability of contaminated levotryptophan preparations in seven (54%) of 13 patients. One patient with levotryptophan-associated generalized morphea also had lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and acanthosis nigricans, findings not previously reported in patients with EMS. In addition, we compared the clinical and laboratory features of levotryptophan-associated EF and idiopathic EF. Myalgias, muscle weakness, paresthesias, morpheaform plaques, cutaneous ulcers, and livedo reticularis were more common in patients with levotryptophan-associated EF. We conclude that levotryptophan-associated EF and localized scleroderma were present before the presumed date of contaminated levotryptophan availability. The clinical spectrum of cutaneous fibrosis associated with the ingestion of levotryptophan includes generalized morphea and EF, which are similar though not identical to their idiopathic counterparts. 
Prevalence and malignant potential of colorectal polyps in asymptomatic, average-risk men. Screening colonoscopy was performed on 119 asymptomatic elderly men with no other risk factors for colonic neoplasms. Ninety adenomas were detected in 49 (41%) subjects. Mean adenoma size was 6.5 mm, with 83 (92%) less than or equal to 10 mm. Forty-nine (54%) adenomas were located proximal to the splenic flexure, and 17 (19%) were classified as tubulovillous or villous. Moderate- to high-grade dysplasia was found in 29 (32%) adenomas and was associated with larger size (p less than 0.0001) and villous architecture (p = 0.0038). Two subjects harbored adenomas with invasive cancer. Seventy-one hyperplastic polyps were found in 40 (34%) subjects. The mean size of hyperplastic polyps was 3.4 mm, and 64 (90%) were located in the left colon. We conclude that, in this population, adenomas are common lesions that are frequently small. However, substantial proportions of these adenomas may be at risk for malignant degeneration due to the presence of villous architecture and higher grades of dysplasia. Because adenomas and hyperplastic polyps are endoscopically indistinguishable, all polyps found at endoscopy should be removed or ablated. 
Direct myocardial revascularization without extracorporeal circulation. Experience in 700 patients Between May 1978 and March 1990, 700 patients were operated on with direct coronary surgery without extracorporeal circulation (ECC): 529 (76 percent) were male and 171 (24 percent) were female. The average age was 64 years (range, 35 to 86 years), 454 (65 percent) had unstable angina, 163 (23 percent) had stable angina, 51 (7 percent) had postmyocardial infarction angina, and 32 (5 percent) had acute myocardial infarction at the moment of the operation. In this series of patients, all branches of the coronary arteries were bypassed; the mammary artery was used in 40 percent of the cases, the average bypass per patient was 2.2 (range, 1 to 5), and 26 percent had associated disease of high risk to undergo ECC. The morbidity was 4 percent and the mortality for this series of patients was 1 percent; the probability of survival at seven years was 90 percent. This experience shows us that this surgery is an alternative in the treatment of coronary disease, especially for aged patients with associated disease, in some cases of acute transmural infarction, and also for patients who need coronary angioplasty. Also, it can improve the relation cost/benefit in coronary surgery. 
Diazepam and intubation in emergency treatment of seizures in children. STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of endotracheal intubation after the use of diazepam compared with phenobarbital or phenytoin in emergency treatment of seizures in children. DESIGN: The records of all children (98) were reviewed in a case-control fashion. A logistic regression model was used to determine whether there was an association between diazepam administration and intubation, adjusting for all other covariates (age, weight, convulsion time before first anticonvulsant was given, response latency, diagnosis, and therapy). SETTING: All children were treated in an emergency department and then transported to a tertiary pediatric center by a pediatric transport team. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All patients were children, with a median age of 2.7 years (range 0.17 to 15.3 years). INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Only the use of diazepam was found to be significantly associated with intubation after adjusting for all other covariates (adjusted odds ratio, 49.4; P less than .001). In the comparison of diazepam versus phenobarbital or phenytoin used as the first anticonvulsant, median response latency did not differ (27.0 vs 32.5 minutes, P greater than .83). CONCLUSION: A significant association was found between diazepam use and intubation. Response latency was not shorter when diazepam was used as the initial anticonvulsant compared with phenobarbital or phenytoin. 
Arterial hemorrhage after pancreatoduodenectomy. The 'sentinel bleed'. Experienced centers report reduced operative mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy for cancer, but significant complications continue to occur in as many as 25% of patients. Anastomotic disruption leads to sepsis in the pancreatic bed where major vascular structures have been exposed by regional lymphadenectomy, creating a setting for arterial erosion or ligature slough and massive hemorrhage. Dehiscence of the pancreatojejunostomy is a particular risk. We treated five patients with arterial hemorrhage after pancreatoduodenectomy, all of whom had had "sentinel" bleeding from the abdominal drains or gastrointestinal tract. Results of endoscopy were misleading in two patients. Three of five patients were saved by prompt recognition, early operation, and, in one instance, angiographic embolization. Sentinel bleeding after pancreatoduodenectomy indicates local sepsis and probable anastomotic dehiscence. Recognition of its significance and prompt response may prevent exsanguination. 
Observer variation in assessing neurophysical signs among patients with head injuries. As an early phase in the development of a valid and reliable measure of the neurophysical sequelae after head injury, we carried out assessments of interrater agreement on representative items. The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of agreement among expert raters who independently measured neurophysical signs on patients undergoing physical rehabilitation after brain injury. Agreement was described using the index of crude agreement, expected agreement and Kappa. Therapists showed a high degree of agreement on those items forming part of a routine neurological assessment: prehension, coordination, voluntary movements and tendon reflexes. Crude agreement ranged from 77.8-100%. There was considerable discordance in assessing muscle tonus, equilibrium and protective reactions, spinal reflexes, tremor and dysmetria (crude agreement ranged from 49.7-97.9%). Although, the number of subjects was small, the information generated from this study will be useful in refining our instrument for the assessment of neurophysical signs. 
Nontraumatic abdominal aortic thrombosis presenting with anterior spinal artery syndrome and pulmonary edema. A 51-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer developed pulmonary edema and lower extremity paraplegia with preservation of proprioception as the initial manifestation of abdominal aortic thrombosis. Back pain was present in the lumbar region radiating to buttocks and legs in a bilateral radicular pattern. Femoral pulses were initially palpable. Aortic angiography revealed complete abdominal aortic occlusion at L3 as well as total occlusion of the bilateral superficial femoral arteries and bilateral common iliac arteries. Transient occlusion of the anterior spinal artery due to aortic thrombosis may cause paraplegia and may also progress to renal failure, bowel infarction, and limb loss if left untreated. Abdominal aortic thrombosis needs to be considered in a patient who presents with an anterior spinal artery syndrome, which, if present, must be treated as rapidly as possible to preserve motor and sensory function. 
Use of the robust sib-pair method to screen for single-locus, multiple-locus, and pleiotropic effects: application to traits related to hypertension. Robust sib-pair linkage analysis can be used as a screening tool in the search for the potential involvement of single-loci, multiple-loci, and pleiotropic effects of single loci underlying phenotypic variation. Four large families were each ascertained through one adult white male with essential hypertension. The robust sib-pair method was used to screen these families for evidence of linkage between 39 quantitative traits related to hypertension and 25 genetic marker loci. All traits were analyzed on the untransformed, square-root and log-transformed scales. Among other findings, there is a suggestion of linkage between the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase locus on chromosome 1p36 and mean fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure. There may also be linkage between the following markers and traits: the adenylate kinase-1 marker and/or the Lewis blood group marker and the traits height, weight, and biacromial breadth; the glyoxylase I marker and the traits upper-arm circumference and suprailiac skinfold thickness; the ABO blood group and adenylate kinase-1 markers on chromosome 9q34 and the third component of complement marker on chromosome 19p13 and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase; and the P1 blood group and the traits weight and 1-h postload serum glucose level. 
Subcutaneous lidocaine for treatment of neuropathic cancer pain. Three patients with terminal malignancy reporting ineffective analgesia using systemic and subsequently spinal opiates were treated with subcutaneous infusion of 10% lidocaine hydrochloride. During the infusion, reasonably stable blood concentrations were achieved and maintained using a subcutaneous infusion at varying dose rates over days to months with improvement of the pain complaints which continued to be refractory to conventional analgesics. Blood lidocaine levels obtained at regular intervals revealed effective concentrations between 2 and 5 micrograms/ml for each patient. 
Not all nonpalpable breast cancers are alike. Clinical and mammographic data of 1009 consecutive patients were correlated with histopathologic data of 1144 biopsy specimens of nonpalpable breast lesions to better define the presentation and biologic behavior of early breast cancer. Patients with malignant neoplasms (269 [24%] of 1144 specimens) were older (mean age, 62.1 years) than patients with benign lesions (mean age, 54.9 years). Furthermore, patients with invasive disease were older (mean age, 63.3 years) than patients with noninvasive disease (mean age, 58.5 years) with an overall increased risk of invasive cancer per year of 1.035. A 58% incidence of invasive cancer was detected for lesions characterized by calcifications, while the incidence of invasive cancer was 84% for isolated mass lesions (relative risk, 4.31 for masses). Isolated mammographic calcifications associated with cancer appeared in a younger population and were significantly associated with noninvasive ductal cancer. Breast cancer presenting as a mammographic mass appeared in an older group and was highly associated with the presence of invasive disease. 
Effect of various lipid emulsions on total parenteral nutrition-induced hepatosteatosis in rats. The effect of various lipid emulsions on the development of fatty liver during total parenteral nutrition (TPN) was investigated in rats given TPN for 7 days. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), long-chain triglycerides (LCT), chemically defined triglycerides (CDT; structured lipid with a high purity of 94.3%), and a mixture of MCT and LCT (MIX) were prepared as the lipid emulsions. TPN provided 350 kcal/kg/day, with a nonprotein calorie/nitrogen ratio of 160. The TPN-1 group received 10% nonprotein calories and the TPN-2 group received 30% nonprotein calories. MCT TPN was found to have some disadvantages, especially with regard to nitrogen balance and plasma albumin levels. Total cholesterol and phospholipids tended to be high in the MCT TPN group. The hepatic lipid content was higher in the lipid-free TPN and the MCT TPN groups, and lower in the CDT and LCT TPN groups. Histologically, the livers of the MIX, CDT, and LCT TPN groups showed less fatty change than those of the FREE and MCT groups. 
Anticonvulsant activity of two orally active competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, CGP 37849 and CGP 39551, against sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice and photically induced myoclonus in Papio papio. Two novel N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid CPG 37849 and the corresponding 1-ethyl ester CGP 39551, were tested as anticonvulsants in DBA/2 mice and photosensitive Senegalese baboons, Papio papio. In DBA/2 mice, CGP 37849 is more potent than CGP 39551 when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) (ED50 for suppression of clonic seizures at 60 min: i.c.v. 0.038 and 0.21 nmol; i.p. 3.40 and 19.1 mumol/kg, respectively). When administered orally in mice, the two compounds are approximately equipotent (ED50 CGP 37849, 35.2 mumol/kg; ED50 CGP 39551, 28.1 mumol/kg). The time course of action of CGP 39551 is exceptionally prolonged: 42 mumol/kg i.p. protects against clonic seizures for 48 h. Protection provided by other NMDA antagonists in mice is of much shorter duration: 2-amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (AP5) 1 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid (AP7) 4 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid 1-ethyl ester 3 h, 4-(3-phosphonopropyl)-2-piperazine carboxylic acid (CPP) 2 h, cis-4-(phosphonomethyl)-2-piperidine-carboxylic acid (CGS 19755) 4 h, and CGP 37849 4 h. After oral administration of the drugs, the therapeutic index (TI = ratio of the ED50 values for rotorod performance and anticonvulsant protection) remains relatively constant at 5.9-7.2 for 3 h (CGP 37849) and 4.0-6.1 for 24 h (CGP 39551). After i.p. administration, the TI values are CGP 37849 at 1 h 2.4, and at 3 h 20.0, CGP 39551 at 1 h 2.3, at 3 h 7.1, and at 24 h 3.6. In baboons, acute administration of CGP 37849 at doses of 48-191 mumol/kg intravenously (i.v.) suppresses photically induced myoclonus for at least 285 min, with severe side effects at the highest dose tested. CGP 39551 at doses of 169-675 mumol/kg i.v. shows weak anticonvulsant activity only at the highest dose tested (accompanied by severe side effects). CGP 37849 at 48-96 mumol/kg orally (p.o.) fails to protect against photically induced myoclonus up to 4 h after administration, but 191 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces complete suppression of seizures after 24 h. On the other hand, CGP 39551 at 169 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces total suppression of seizure activity at 4 h with a longer duration of anticonvulsant action (2-3 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
A geriatric-anesthesiologic program to reduce acute confusional states in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a geriatric-anesthesiologic intervention program for the prevention and treatment of acute confusional states (ACS) in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures. The intervention program was based on the results of previous prospective studies in similar patient populations. The outcome of the intervention, comprising 103 patients, was compared with that of an earlier study comprising 111 patients. The intervention program consisted of pre- and post-operative geriatric assessments, oxygen therapy, early surgery, prevention and treatment of peri-operative blood pressure falls and treatment of post-operative complications. The incidence of ACS was lower, 47.6%, in the intervention study compared with 61.3% (P less than 0.05) in the control study. Furthermore, the ACS that occurred in the intervention study was less severe and of shorter duration than that in the control study. The incidence of post-operative decubital ulcers, severe falls, and urinary retention was also lower. The mean duration of orthopedic ward stay was 17.4 days in the control study and 11.6 days in the intervention study (P less than 0.001). It can be concluded that the intervention program reduced the incidence, severity, and duration of ACS which resulted in a shortened orthopedic ward stay. 
Testicular scanning: evaluating the acute scrotum in the clinical setting. In a retrospective study of patients with acute scrotal pain presenting to the hospitals of Southern Illinois University School of Medicine from January 1982 until September 1987, determination was made of the appropriate use of testicular scan for definitive diagnosis. Though the testicular scan is a highly sensitive and specific examination in the identification of testicular torsion, we believe its routine use in clinical practice is limited. Appropriate utilization of the examination requires its use in high-risk groups with equivocal physical findings or in patients with unusual presentations of age, anatomy, or neurologic deficit. The scan if used for routine screening of the acute scrotum would result in needless delays and unjustifiable expense when it is mandatory that the treatment be immediate surgical exploration. 
Hereditary hyperparathyroidism and multiple ossifying jaw fibromas: a clinically and genetically distinct syndrome. A large previously reported family with hyperparathyroidism has been reinvestigated recently because of the occurrence of multiple ossifying jaw fibromas in two affected members of the third generation similar to the jaw tumors of four of five affected members of the first generation. These maxillary and mandibular tumors can be differentiated from the "brown tumors" of hyperparathyroidism because they can appear and enlarge even though the hypercalcemia is surgically corrected. These tumors are histologically distinct fibroosseous lesions without the giant cells seen in "brown tumors." The parathyroid enlargement was mostly uniglandular, with multiple tumors found occasionally. Studies in DNA linkage were performed within this large family and a similar family in Houston to determine if the gene for this syndrome, termed HRPT2, is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 11, to which the gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 has been linked. (This linkage is supported by our findings in one family with MEN 1 reported here.) Linkage studies were also performed with markers on chromosome 10, to which the genes for MEN 2A and MEN 2B have been linked. Evidence against close linkage with chromosome 10 and chromosome 11 markers suggests that this clinically distinct syndrome is also genetically distinct. 
Carcinoma erysipeloides. We report an 83-year-old woman with carcinoma erysipeloides due to an occult carcinoma. Immunohistochemical study of skin biopsies showed reactivity to S-100 protein and human milk fat globule antigen indicating that the tumour originated in the breast. 
Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography of atrioventricular septal defect. To determine the accuracy and utility of single-plane transesophageal echocardiography in analyzing atrioventricular (AV) septal defect, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography was performed before and after institution of cardiopulmonary bypass in 16 patients (age 24 days to 14 years, weight 3 to 47 kg). Prebypass transesophageal echocardiography (including two-dimensional echocardiography, Doppler color flow mapping and pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound) correctly diagnosed divided AV valve, common AV valve and unbalanced AV valve, as well as atrial or ventricular septal defect, or both, in all cases. It correctly analyzed AV valve regurgitation in all 10 patients with right and all 14 with left AV valve regurgitation and correctly analyzed 30 of 33 additional cardiac anomalies. Transesophageal echocardiography was able to detect the absence of normal pulmonary venous connections but failed to demonstrate all of the complex anomalous pulmonary venous connections in three patients with atrial isomerism. Postbypass transesophageal echocardiography documented the absence of a significant residual shunt in 11 of 11 patients undergoing corrective surgery and verified residual AV valve regurgitation in 7 of 9 patients with tricuspid regurgitation and 11 of 13 with mitral regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiographic information that altered or refined the surgical treatment was obtained in 5 (31%) of 16 patients. Epicardial and transesophageal echocardiography results were concordant in all 13 patients in whom both were performed. Transesophageal echocardiography provides useful and accurate imaging of the important two-dimensional, pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound and Doppler color flow mapping features in AV septal defect. 
Primary angiosarcoma of the brain. We have described a 32-year-old black woman who had a primary angiosarcoma of the right occipital lobe. All three previously reported cases have been fatal within 1 year. Our patient is doing well more than 3 1/2 years after surgery. 
Abnormal liver enzyme-mediated metabolism in Parkinson's disease: a second look. If toxicant exposure contributes to the cause of Parkinson's disease, poor function of detoxifying enzymes could increase vulnerability for Parkinson's disease. Although no hepatic enzyme system has been shown universally to be dysfunctional in Parkinson's disease patients, several have been suggested to be dysfunctional in subgroups, such as those with young age at disease onset. Specific enzymes implicated include several P450 enzymes, most notably P450 IID6, and cysteine dioxygenase. If hepatic enzyme abnormalities contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease, molecular genetic techniques may allow the development of screening tests to identify at-risk subjects in order to intervene with protective therapies. 
Bilateral ureteral obstruction following aortobifemoral bypass graft. In this report we present a case of bilateral ureteral obstruction, a potentially serious late complication of aortic bifurcation surgery. The incidence, aetiology, clinical presentation and treatment are discussed. 
Does patient age or intestinal pathology influence the bacteria found in cases of necrotizing enterocolitis? To evaluate the relationship between bacterial colonization in neonatal peritonitis and patient age or intestinal pathology, we retrospectively reviewed peritoneal culture results from 96 infants having surgery for necrotizing enterocolitis. Microorganisms recovered mirrored those usually found as fecal flora within the neonatal intensive care unit. These reflect, in turn, the abnormal colonization intrinsic to care in the intensive care nursery. Analysis revealed no significant correlation between the disease and either age of the infant or intestinal site of disease. 
Obstruction of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta: results of treatment with balloon angioplasty. Our experience in the treatment of stenoses of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta with balloon angioplasty in 27 patients is reported. Clinical findings were lower limb claudication (all patients), impotence (eight patients), and blue-toe syndrome (two patients). The underlying disease was atherosclerosis in 24 patients and nonspecific aortoarteritis in three patients. Dilatation was successful in all patients. Embolic occlusions of the left common iliac artery (one patient) and left superficial femoral artery (one patient) were the only major complications. Claudication in the affected limb continued in the first patient; the second died when diagnostic angiography, performed 3 months after angioplasty, caused a severe atheroembolus. Of the other 25 patients, nine of the 10 followed up for 13-48 months and all seven followed up for 3-8 months were free of symptoms. Six of eight patients with sexual dysfunction had normal function after angioplasty. Seven patients still awaited follow-up and one was lost to follow-up. Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty is an effective treatment of stenoses of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of pulmonary artery aneurysm. Pulmonary artery aneurysm is a rare condition. We have presented what we believe to be the first case in the English literature to be diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. 
Analysis of anti-tumor antibodies in mice and rabbits induced by monoclonal anti-idiotope antibodies. Eight different mouse monoclonal anti-idiotope antibodies (mAb2) generated against a mouse monoclonal anti-human melanoma proteoglycan Ag (MPG) antibody (mAb1), MEM136, were tested for their ability to induce anti-MPG responses in mice and rabbits. All Ab2 were idiotypically cross-reactive and combining site-specific as demonstrated by competitive cross-inhibition studies and their ability to inhibit the binding of MEM136 to the melanoma cells, Colo38. However, only two Ab2, IM32 and IM06, were able to induce specific anti-TAA-specific (Ab1') responses in rabbits. When IM32 and IM06 were tested in allogeneic stains of mice for the induction of anti-MPG responses, only IM32 produced an Ab1' response. In mice, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 is idiotypically cross-reactive with its Ab1. Furthermore, the IM32-induced murine Ab3 and MEM136 recognized a similar MPG epitope on the melanoma cells because the Ab3 inhibited the binding of MEM136 to melanoma cells. The Ab3 induced by IM32 and IM06 in rabbits also recognized a similar epitope as the Ab1. In rabbits, the Ab3 response induced by IM32 and IM06 were idiotypically cross-reactive with each other. However, additional studies indicated that the majority of Ab3 induced by IM32 were IM32 Id-specific and lacked IM06 idiotopes. Further experimentation indicated that IM32-induced rabbit Ab3 were biologically active as demonstrated by the ability of the Ab3 to inhibit melanoma cell invasion in a Matrigel assay. 
Large amplitude sensory action potentials in myelopathy: an observation. Subjects with at least one sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude greater than 2 SD above the age-matched mean during standard nerve conduction tests were evaluated for evidence of spinal cord disease. From a total of 153 subjects, 16 had at least one large amplitude SAP and 12 of 16 (75%) had a documented myelopathy. While a mechanism has yet to be determined, this observation suggests that SAP amplitudes greater than 2 SD above normal may be correlated with clinical evidence of injury to the central nervous system. 
Recurrent adnexal torsion and cystadenoma of aberrant ovarian tissue. Torsion of the adnexa is rare, and diagnosis is difficult because of the sparse clinical findings. I describe a patient with recurrent torsion of the right adnexa, involving a cystadenoma of aberrant ovarian tissue. Her only symptom was recurrent right-sided pelvic pain. 
Treatment of pseudotumor cerebri by primary and secondary optic nerve sheath decompression. We performed optic nerve sheath decompression in 53 patients (101 eyes) with pseudotumor cerebri and visual loss. Sixty-nine eyes (85 patients) with acute papilledema uniformly had improved visual function after optic nerve sheath decompression. Of 32 eyes with chronic papilledema (18 patients), only ten had improved visual function after optic nerve sheath decompression. This difference was significant (P = .0001). Thirteen eyes required secondary or tertiary optic nerve sheath decompression after an initial successful result. Eleven of 13 eyes had improved visual function after repeat optic nerve sheath decompression. We believe that patients with acute papilledema and visual loss should be offered optic nerve sheath decompression, and if symptoms recur, repeat optic nerve sheath decompression is a safe and effective treatment option. 
A randomized trial of ticarcillin and clavulanate versus gentamicin and clindamycin in patients with complicated appendicitis. Secondary bacterial peritonitis is usually a polymicrobial infection of facultative gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Treatment consists of operation and broad-spectrum antibiotic administration. The antibiotic treatment of choice in these infections has been the combination of gentamicin and clindamycin. However, this combination can have toxic side effects and necessitates frequent monitoring of serum levels. Beta-lactam antibiotics provide broad-spectrum coverage and low toxicity, but can be inactivated by species of bacteria producing beta-lactamase enzymes. Clavulanic acid is a potent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and has been shown to extend the efficacy of ticarcillin to bacteria producing these enzymes. This combination was compared with gentamicin and clindamycin in 99 consecutive patients with complicated appendicitis. Eradication of identified pathogens was greater in the ticarcillin and clavulanate group (98 per cent) than in the gentamicin and clindamycin group (92 per cent), even for the subgroup of organisms producing beta-lactamases (97 versus 90 per cent eradication). Complications and clinical response were not significantly different between the two treatment groups. Ticarcillin and clavulanic acid is a safe and effective alternative to gentamicin and clindamycin in the treatment of secondary bacterial peritonitis and offers advantages in dosing simplicity and freedom from ototoxic and nephrotoxic effects. 
The accuracy of malignant diagnoses established by fine needle aspiration cytologic procedures of mammary masses. Fine needle aspiration cytologic studies are being used with increasing frequency to diagnose carcinoma of the breast. To determine whether or not a diagnosis of carcinoma established by cytologic examination is sufficiently accurate to proceed to treatment without tissue confirmation, we have examined our results in a series of 109 patients who had 111 aspiration cytologic procedures followed by open biopsy between January 1985 and June 1987. From this group, 39 specimens were read as malignant and 19 were read as suspicious. Thirty-eight of 39 specimens with positive readings were from lesions that proved to be malignant on subsequent open biopsy. Seventeen of 19 suspicious specimens were also from malignant lesions. Three of 17 specimens that were inadequate and nine of 36 negative specimens were from lesions that were later shown to be malignant. Our single false-positive result occurred on cells that had been air dried during preparation in the early months of experience with this technique at our institution. Re-evaluated later in our series, the same specimen was called suspicious rather than malignant. We conclude that a positive reading on fine needle aspiration is highly accurate. The positive predictive value should be 100 per cent, once experience is gained in preparing and interpreting the material. Open biopsy is necessary for inadequate, negative or suspicious specimens to exclude a malignant lesion if the clinical or mammographic findings are consistent with carcinoma. 
Neurocutaneous melanosis: definition and review of the literature. Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by the presence of large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and benign or malignant pigment cell tumors of the leptomeninges. The syndrome is thought to represent an error in the morphogenesis of the embryonal neuroectoderm. We review 39 reported cases of neurocutaneous melanosis and propose revised criteria for diagnosis. Most patients with neurocutaneous melanosis presented in the first 2 years of life with neurologic manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, or spinal cord compression. Leptomeningeal melanoma was present in 62% of the cases, but even in the absence of melanoma, symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis had an extremely poor prognosis. Useful diagnostic procedures include cerebrospinal fluid cytology and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast. Patients may be aided by palliative measures such as shunt placement to reduce intracranial pressure. Dermatologists in their follow-up of patients with large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi should be aware of this condition, to aid in prompt diagnosis and because the treatment of cutaneous lesions may be altered in the presence of symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis. 
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of pancreatic duct stones. Chronic calcifying pancreatitis presents a major clinical problem, often requiring extensive surgery. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) offers a new therapeutic option. We applied ESWL after endoscopic sphincterotomy of the pancreatic orifice in eight patients with impacted pancreatic duct stones. An electromagnetic lithotriptor (Siemens Lithostar, Erlangen, FRG) was used. Patients were treated in prone position under fluoroscopic control. A mean of 6,813 shock waves (range 1,500-10,000) was delivered in one or two sessions. Disintegration of stones was achieved in 6/8 patients, initial relief of pain in 7/8 patients, and total clearance of the pancreatic duct in 3/8 patients. One patient had an exacerbation of her pancreatitis one day after ESWL, which resolved rapidly with medical treatment. No other complications were observed. Four of five patients with fragmented stones had no abdominal complaints at follow-up (mean 17 months, range 3-27). Three patients in whom ESWL was not completely successful (two without and one with partial fragmentation) underwent an operation according to Puestow. Two of them still have abdominal complaints after surgery. From these data, we conclude that ESWL of pancreatic duct stones is a promising new alternative for surgery, when endoscopic stone extraction fails. 
Iron oxide-enhanced MR imaging of the liver and spleen: review of the first 5 years. Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) particles are a potent new class of MR contrast agents affording improved detection of hepatic and splenic neoplasms. In this report we review the development of this agent through preclinical studies and early clinical results at Massachusetts General Hospital during a 5-year investigation. SPIO particles are sequestered by normal phagocytic Kupffer cells of the reticuloendothelial system (RES) but are not retained in tumor tissue. Consequently, there is a fivefold increase in T2 relaxation between normal RES tissue and tumor, with a comparable advantage in quantitative signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, and lesion detectability in the liver and spleen on MR imaging. Increased lesion conspicuity can be exploited to decrease threshold size for lesion detection to less than 3 mm. Clinically beneficial effects occur with a variety of mildly T2-weighted spin-echo pulse sequences; gradient-echo techniques show even greater benefit after administration of SPIO. Metabolically, pharmaceutical-grade preparations are biodegradable and bioavailable, being rapidly turned over into body iron stores and incorporated into erythrocyte hemoglobin. Early dose-escalation clinical trials have identified a probable clinical dose range of 10-20 mumols Fe/kg body weight. In the United States, SPIO compounds evaluated to date are still approved for use in investigational studies only. Newer commercial formulations currently being evaluated may extend clinical safety margins. 
Extended duration of herpes simplex virus DNA in genital lesions detected by the polymerase chain reaction. To evaluate the utility of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for documenting herpes simplex virus (HSV) in persons with reactivated genital lesions viral isolation was compared with a recently developed PCR method. Three women experiencing four episodes of recurrent genital herpes were followed for 10 days per episode with daily examination and duplicate swabs of the lesions, one for HSV culture and one for PCR. HSV type 2 was cultured from three of four episodes and the mean duration of viral isolation from recurrent genital lesions was 2.6 days. PCR detected HSV DNA from lesion swabs during all four episodes, and HSV DNA was positive for an average of 6.8 days. HSV DNA was demonstrated in ulcerative lesions on 15 of 17 days versus 3 of 17 days by viral isolation (P less than .01). HSV PCR became negative when the lesions reepithelialized. These data suggest that PCR is a more sensitive measure of HSV infection than routine viral culture and that PCR detects the presence of HSV at times when culture is negative. 
Triple agent immunosuppression in serpiginous choroiditis. Serpiginous choroidopathy is a progressive choroidal inflammatory disorder that typically has a variable saltatory course. Response to steroids is uncertain. By using azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone in combination, the authors have observed rapid remission of active disease in five patients. Remissions have been maintained for periods up to 18 months. Because of the synergistic effects of this combination, doses could rapidly be reduced to maintenance levels without reactivation. Disease in two patients recurred immediately after discontinuation of low-dose therapy but was arrested when therapy resumed. Triple agent immunosuppressive therapy is well tolerated and appears to be effective. 
Hypertension-induced changes of platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression in rat aorta and heart. Hypertension-associated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells might be mediated in vivo by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). Our previous investigations in hypertensive rats failed to demonstrate changes in aortic steady-state mRNA levels of PDGF A or B chains. The current studies were performed to determine whether hypertension might affect the expression of PDGF receptors. We studied PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor gene expression by Northern analysis using human and rat cDNA probes. Studies of tissue distribution revealed that PDGF beta-receptor mRNA was most abundant in total aorta and aortic media, whereas the PDGF alpha-receptor mRNA was most abundant in the lung and was expressed at low levels in aortic tissue. Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension induced a threefold increase in aortic steady-state PDGF beta-receptor mRNA levels. Aortic PDGF beta-receptor expression also was higher in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) when compared with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls. Aortic PDGF alpha-receptor steady-state mRNA levels were unchanged in DOCA-salt hypertension and were expressed at similar levels in WKY rats and SHRs. Unlike the findings with aorta, cardiac PDGF beta- and alpha-receptor and PDGF B-chain expressions were unchanged in the DOCA-salt model and were decreased in SHRs. These findings indicate that hypertension can increase aortic steady-state mRNA levels for PDGF beta-receptor. They also indicate that tissue-specific expression of the genes of the PDGF ligand/receptor system are differentially regulated in hypertension. 
Subglottic laryngeal closure for aspiration. Aspiration may be life threatening, particularly in those patients with severe central neurological disease. From such a group of patients, several were identified who had severe laryngeal dysfunction and aspiration. The majority of patients in this subgroup existed in a neurologically vegetative state. In an attempt to reduce the degree of aspiration they experienced, the procedure of subglottic laryngeal closure was performed. Essentially, the operation is designed to isolate the tracheal airway from the incompetent larynx. The aim is to protect the lower airway from pharyngeal contamination. In all 5 patients there was a marked improvement in general and pulmonary health. 
Pain in neonatal circumcision. Because newborn circumcision is a quick and safe surgical procedure, any method to relieve pain must be almost risk-free in order to be acceptable. General anesthesia and narcotic analgesia are not appropriate. Dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) with lidocaine hydrochloride is probably the most effective and safest form of anesthesia for newborn circumcision currently available, but it can cause significant local and systemic reactions. Only a limited number of cases of DPNB have been reported and we feel that this procedure should be used cautiously until there is more published evidence of its safety. Alternative methods of pain relief including oral acetaminophen and topical anesthesia should also be studied. Of special interest is recent evidence that a sucrose-flavored pacifier is an effective analgesic during newborn circumcision. 
Heterogeneity of T cell lymphoblastic leukaemias. Twenty eight out of 170 consecutive cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were examined. They were of T cell origin, with the following distribution: seven (28%) cases had pre-T or prothymic features; nine (36%) cases showed early thymocytic features, six (24%) had cortical features; and three (12%) had a "mature" phenotype. The remaining three cases could not be sub-classified. A striking finding was that pre-T ALL differed from intrathymic ALL not only in the absence of both E rosettes and intrathymic differentiation antigens, but also in the expression of two non-lineage specific antigens HLA-DR and CD10. Both antigens appear in the bone marrow from the very first stages of lymphoid differentiation, implying that the origin for pre-T ALL is bone marrow. A comparison of the clinical features of pre-T and thymic ALL showed that pre-T ALL disease showed a pattern more similar to non-T ALL disease: a lower incidence of mediastinal mass, absence of extrahaematopoietic disease, lower white cell counts and haemoglobin concentrations, and a higher incidence of bone pain. No obvious difference in response to treatment was apparent. The results show that T-ALL is not only a heterogeneous immunological group but also suggest that it may have different origins: bone marrow for pre-T ALL and the thymus for thymic ALL. 
A new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia. A new provocative test for chronic mesenteric ischemia is described, based upon the demonstration of a fall in the intramural pH of the small bowel after introduction of a test meal into the stomach. Intramural pH (pHI) is determined indirectly by tonometry, utilizing a tonometer passed per os. Postoperative assessment of revascularization procedures is also possible by the same technique. Application of the test in an 84-yr-old woman showed good correlation between a preoperative fall in jejunal intramural pH and abdominal pain, and the absence of a fall postoperatively after successful revascularization. 
Expression of human HLA-B27 transgene alters susceptibility to murine Theiler's virus-induced demyelination. Infection of certain strains of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus results in persistence of virus and an immune-mediated primary demyelination in the central nervous system that resembles multiple sclerosis. Because susceptibility/resistance to demyelination in B10 congeneic mice maps strongly to class I MHC genes (D region) we tested whether expression of a human class I MHC gene (HLA-B27) would alter susceptibility to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus-induced demyelination. Transgenic HLA-B27 mice were found to co-express human and endogenous mouse class I MHC genes by flow microfluorimetry analysis of PBL. In the absence of the human transgene, H-2stf, or v mice but not H-2b mice had chronic demyelination and persistence of virus at 45 days after infection. No difference in degree of demyelination, meningeal inflammation, or virus persistence was seen between transgenic HLA-B27 and nontransgenic littermate mice of H-2f or H-2v haplotype. In contrast, H-2s (HLA-B27+) mice showed a dramatic decrease in extent of demyelination and number of virus-Ag+ cells in the spinal cord compared with H-2s (HLA-B27-) littermate mice. In addition, none of the eight H-2s mice homozygous for HLA-B27 gene had spinal cord lesions even though infectious virus was isolated chronically from their central nervous system. Expression of HLA-B27 transgene did not interfere with the resistance to demyelination normally observed in B10 (H-2b) mice. These experiments demonstrate that expression of a human class I MHC gene can modulate a virus-induced demyelinating disease process in the mouse. 
Ventricular arrhythmias in children with an apparently normal heart. Ventricular ectopy occurs frequently in normal children. In the presence of a normal heart, these arrhythmias, including asymptomatic, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, carry a benign prognosis and are not associated with sudden, unexpected death. However, complex ventricular arrhythmias frequently indicate the presence of underlying cardiac disease; patients with such arrhythmias must undergo an appropriately thorough evaluation before decisions regarding prognosis and the need for therapy can be made. 
Does fetal seizure activity mean a poor outcome? A case report. Fetal seizure activity is very rare: only three cases have been reported. A case of fetal seizure activity was detected with ultrasound. Such activity can be associated with a poor outcome. 
Quantification of Helicobacter pylori infection in gastritis and ulcer disease using a simple and rapid carbon-14-urea breath test. Gastric urease was studied isotopically in 230 patients with biopsy-proven normal mucosa or chronic gastritis, including 59 patients with ulcer disease. Carbon-14-urea was given in 25 ml of water without substrate carrier or nutrient-dense meal, and breath samples were collected over a 60-min period. The amount of 14CO2 excreted at 10 min was independent of the rate of gastric emptying and was not quantitatively influenced by the buccal urease activity. The 10-min 14CO2 values discriminated well between Helicobacter pylori positive and negative patients (94% sensitivity, 89% specificity) and correlated with the number of organisms assessed by histology. The test was a good predictor of chronic gastritis (95% sensitivity and 96% specificity), and a quantitative relationship was observed between 14CO2 values and the severity and activity of the gastritis. In H. pylori positive patients, breath 14CO2 was found to be similar in patients with and without ulcer disease, suggesting that the number of bacteria is not a determining factor for the onset of ulceration. 
A long-term study of hepatitis C virus replication in non-A, non-B hepatitis. BACKGROUND. Although antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) are known to be associated with non-A, non-B hepatitis, little is known about the pattern of HCV replication, its relation to antibody levels, and the clinical course of non-A, non-B hepatitis. METHODS. We measured HCV RNA in serial serum samples from five patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis who were followed for 10 to 14 years after transfusion. We also studied four chimpanzees that were experimentally infected with serum from four of these patients. Serum HCV RNA was detected by a "nested" polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay that used two sets of primers derived from the third (NS3) and fourth (NS4) non-structural gene regions of the HCV genome. RESULTS. HCV sequences were detected by PCR in only two of the five patients and two of the four chimpanzees with the set of primers corresponding to the NS3 region, but in all five patients (and in all four chimpanzees) with the primers from the NS4 region. Serum HCV RNA was first detected within three weeks of transfusion in all five patients and within one week in three patients. The viremia lasted less than 4 months in the patient (and two chimpanzees) with acute, self-limited hepatitis, whereas it persisted for 10 to 14 years in the four patients (and for 1 and 3 years in two chimpanzees) with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis. Antibodies to HCV were first detected at week 12 to 14; they disappeared after nine years in the patient with self-limited disease and became borderline after five years in one of the patients with chronic disease. CONCLUSIONS. During the early phase of primary HCV infection, there is a period of several months of sero-negativity during which HCV RNA is the only diagnostic marker of infection. The disappearance of HCV RNA from serum appears to correlate with the resolution of non-A, non-B hepatitis, whereas viremia persists in patients whose disease progresses to chronic hepatitis. In contrast, antibody levels do not necessarily remain elevated in patients with chronic disease. 
Narrow-angle glaucoma presenting as acute, painless visual impairment. A 42-year-old woman presented with the acute onset of bilateral blurred vision that occurred immediately after bending over. She denied pain or any other associated symptoms. Markedly increased intraocular pressure readings were found. Treatment for acute narrow-angle glaucoma was initiated, and normal vision returned. This case represents an atypical presentation of acute narrow-angle glaucoma, a true ophthalmological emergency. The pathophysiology and treatment options of this disease process are summarized. 
Assessment of coronary artery disease using single-photon emission computed tomography with thallium-201 during adenosine-induced coronary hyperemia. Thallium-201 myocardial imaging during dipyridamole-induced coronary hyperemia has been an accepted method for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) and risk stratification. Adenosine is a powerful short-acting coronary vasodilator. Initial results of thallium imaging during adenosine infusion have been encouraging. In 132 patients with CAD and in 16 patients with normal coronary angiograms, adenosine was given intravenously at a dose of 0.14 mg/kg/min for 6 minutes and thallium-201 was injected at 3 minutes. The thallium images using single-photon emission computed tomography were abnormal in 47 of the 54 patients (87%) with 1-vessel, in 34 of 37 patients (92%) with 2-vessel and in 40 of 41 patients (98%) with 3-vessel CAD. The sensitivity was 92% in the 132 patients with CAD (95% confidence intervals, 86 to 96%). In patients with normal coronary angiograms, 14 of 16 patients had normal thallium images (specificity, 88%; 95% confidence intervals, 59 to 100%). The results were very similar when subgroups of patients were analyzed: those without prior myocardial infarction, elderly patients and women. The nature of the perfusion defects (fixed or reversible) was assessed in relation to whether the 4-hour delayed images were obtained with or without the reinjection technique. In patients who underwent conventional delayed imaging, there were more fixed perfusion defects than in patients with reinjection delayed imaging (16 vs 0%, p less than 0.0001). The adverse effects were mild, transient and well tolerated. Thus, adenosine thallium tomographic imaging provides a high degree of accuracy in the diagnosis of CAD. The use of the reinjection technique enhances the ability to detect reversible defects. 
Malignant schwannoma associated with xeroderma pigmentosum in a patient belonging to complementation group D. A 43-year-old man with xeroderma pigmentosum, XP97TO, was allocated to complementation group D. He had had moderate photosensitivity at age 1 year and freckles by age 6 but no neurologic abnormalities. Nevertheless, his fibroblasts in culture had the XP-D phenotype. They showed a sevenfold hypersensitivity to killing by 254 nm ultraviolet radiation and a diminished level (29%) of unscheduled DNA synthesis. Phototesting revealed delayed maximum erythema at 72 hours after UVB exposure and a lowered minimal erythema dose. Lentigo maligna developed on the patient's face, and a rapidly growing malignant schwannoma was found on the left trigeminal nerve. This may be the first case of a peripheral nervous tissue neoplasm in xeroderma pigmentosum. 
Adenosine as a vasodilator in primary pulmonary hypertension BACKGROUND. The acute administration of vasodilator drugs to patients with primary pulmonary hypertension has been advocated to identify those with reversible pulmonary vasoconstriction. Unfortunately, the usefulness of the drugs currently available is limited by accompanying systemic hypotension. A vasodilator with effects confined to the pulmonary circulation would therefore be advantageous in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. The purine nucleoside adenosine was infused into the pulmonary artery in seven patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (baseline pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR], 442-1,295 dyne/cm/sec-5) to determine its effect on PVR. In all patients, there was a dose-dependent and significant reduction (mean maximal percent decrease from baseline, 38.9%; p less than 0.001) in PVR mediated through a decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and an increase in cardiac output. Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) also decreased, but the ratio of PVR to SVR decreased (maximal mean percent decrease from baseline) by 10.5% (p less than 0.025), indicating that adenosine has a preferential vasodilator effect on the pulmonary circulation when administered in this manner. CONCLUSIONS. Because of its pharmacokinetic and vasodilator properties, adenosine may have a specific role in the investigation of primary pulmonary hypertension. 
Reproducibility of Doppler echocardiographic quantification of aortic and mitral valve stenoses: comparison between two echocardiography centers. Doppler echocardiography has been widely used as a noninvasive method to quantify valvular heart diseases. This study assessed the variability between 2 echocardiography centers concerning 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiographic results in the quantification of mitral and aortic valve stenoses. Forty-two patients were studied by 2 different echocardiography centers in a blinded, independent fashion. In patients with aortic and mitral valve stenosis, mean and maximal flow velocities were measured. The aortic valve orifice area was calculated according to the continuity equation. Mitral valve orifice area was determined by direct planimetry and by pressure half-time. In patients with an aortic valve stenosis, a close relation between the 2 centers was found for the maximal and mean flow velocities (coefficient of correlation, r = 0.72 to 0.92; coefficient of variation, 3.7 to 7.7%). A close correlation and a small observer variability was found for the flow velocity ratio determined by flow velocities measured in the left ventricular outflow tract and over the stenotic valve (r = 0.88; coefficient of variation, 0.01 +/- 0.009). In contrast, there was a poor correlation between the diameter of the left ventricular outflow tract and the aortic orifice area (r = 0.36 and 0.59, respectively). In patients with a mitral valve stenosis, mean and maximal velocities were closely correlated (r = 0.85 and 0.77, respectively). Velocities were not found to be significantly different between the 2 centers. Variability between the 2 centers for the mitral valve orifice area was 9.8% (2-dimensional echocardiography) and 5.7% (pressure half-time). 
Hypercarbic ventilatory responses of human heart-lung transplant recipients. To evaluate the effects of chronic pulmonary denervation on ventilatory control, we compared the hypercarbic ventilatory responses (HCVR) of 12 human heart-lung transplant recipients (HL) and 24 normal control subjects (C). The six male HL were subsequently compared with eight male heart transplant recipients (H), as well as the 12 male C. All subjects had normal spirometry, but lung volumes of both transplant groups were somewhat less than those of C. The HCVR of HL and C were indistinguishable (2.68 +/- 0.28 versus 2.71 +/- 0.22 L/min/mm Hg, respectively). The increment of mouth occlusion pressure (delta Pm0.1/delta CO2), however, was markedly greater in HL (P much less than 0.01). The three male groups also had equivalent HCVR, and again, the HL had an increased delta Pm0.1/delta CO2. HL men exhibited larger increments of VT and decreased frequency responses during CO2 rebreathing than did male C and H, although these differences were statistically significant only in the comparison between the transplant groups. We conclude that HL with normal spirometry have appropriate HCVR, despite pulmonary denervation. Pm0.1 responses of these subjects are increased, however, reflecting either a compensatory response to greater respiratory impedances or an occult alteration of ventilatory mechanics. Moreover, compared with subjects with similar pulmonary function, e.g., heart transplant recipients, the breathing pattern of HL during progressive hypercarbia is consistent with the absence of vagal-mediated inflation inhibition. 
Antral choanal polyp presenting as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children is commonly caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy. The diagnostic criteria of OSAS in children are not so well delineated as in adults. We report the first case of antral choanal polyp presenting as OSAS in a 10-year-old boy that initially presented to the child psychiatry service for behavior disturbance, enuresis, and daytime somnolence. Overnight electroencephalogram sleep study revealed events consistent with OSAS. Multiple inhalant allergies, chronic maxillary sinusitis, and obstructive adenoid hypertrophy were diagnosed by the allergy and otolaryngology services. The child was scheduled for adenoidectomy when his sleep apnea symptoms persisted following antimicrobial therapy. Examination under anesthesia revealed a normal adenoid bed and a large left antral choanal polyp. Polypectomy was performed as dictated by parental consent. Postoperatively treatment with an intranasal steroid was begun. However, polypoid nasal mucosa recurred in 2 months and a Caldwell-Luc procedure was performed. Subjective reports following surgery indicated improvement in daytime irritability, attention, and mood. A follow-up overnight electroencephalogram sleep study confirmed resolution of OSAS. 
Hepatitis C virus infection and chronic liver disease in children with leukemia in long-term remission. Antibody to the recently identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) was investigated in sera of 50 leukemic children who had chronic liver disease (CLD), observed for 1 to 12.6 years after therapy withdrawal. All patients were tested for anti-HCV at regular intervals: Ortho-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test was performed in all cases. Reactive sera were also tested by recombinant immunoblotting assay to define the specificity of the results obtained by ELISA. Twelve cases (24%) were persistently positive (group A), 11 (22%) were transiently anti-HCV+ positive (group B), and 27 (54%) were negative. Mean SGPT peak during follow-up was significantly higher in group A (P = .014, A v B and P less than .00001, A v C). SGPT normalized off-therapy in 1 of 12 cases (group A), 10 of 11 (group B), and 19 of 27 (group C) (P = .0004, A v B and P = .012, A v C). Accordingly, liver histology, available in 37 patients, showed signs of chronic hepatitis in all patients in group A while most patients in group B and C had less severe liver lesions. These results indicate that HCV plays a significant role in the etiology of chronic hepatitis in leukemic patients and that persistent anti-HCV activity correlates with a more severe CLD, which could jeopardize the final prognosis of children cured of leukemia.
