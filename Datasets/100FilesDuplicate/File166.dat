Postheparin plasma diamine oxidase values in the follow up of patients with small bowel Crohn's disease. Measurement of postheparin plasma diamine oxidase (PHD) activity has been proposed to assess mucosal integrity in several diseases of the small intestine. In Crohn's disease, PHD values identify a group of patients with predominantly small bowel mucosal damage. To determine the role of mucosal involvement in the progression of small bowel Crohn's disease and whether different PHD values can predict different outcomes the changes in PHD values in 41 patients with small bowel Crohn's disease admitted consecutively to our department were investigated. The test was performed during periods of active disease and after either medical or surgical treatment had resulted in improvement. PHD values were significantly lower than in normal subjects (normal range 3.7-7.7 U/ml). In 35 patients with active disease (Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI) greater than 150) two groups were identified by choosing a cut off value of 2 U/ml: 93% of the 15 patients with PHD values lower than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 1.36 (0.46) U/ml) relapsed at least once in the following year, while only the 20% of the 20 whose values were higher than 2 U/ml (mean (SD) 3.69 (1.50)) relapsed in the same period. The data were statistically significant (Yates's corrected chi 2 = 15.63; p less than 0.0001). The positive and negative predictive values of the test were 93% and 80%, respectively. During relapses, PHD values were consistently lower than previous values, and increased significantly after effective medical or surgical treatment. In the six patients in whom there were no changes in disease activity (CDAI persistently less than 150), there was no change in PHD values. 
The renal growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I axis. Collecting duct is a major site of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) synthesis within kidney. Production of IGF-I at this site is stimulated by growth hormone (GH). IGF-I produced in collecting duct is likely to act on glomerulus and proximal tubule via IGF-I receptors present at these locations. Renal IGF-I may be causative of the glomerular and proximal tubular hypertrophy that occurs in hypersomatotropic states, of compensatory renal hypertrophy, and of renal regeneration following acute ischemic injury. 
Thermochemotherapy in inoperable head and neck cancer. A combined hyperthermia and chemotherapy approach was used to treat five patients with locally advanced or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck whose tumors had failed to respond to chemotherapy. In two patients, tumor had recurred after initial combined modality therapy (surgery/radiation) and had failed to respond to one course of cisplatin/5-fluorouracil (cisplatin/5-FU) chemotherapy. The three remaining patients were enrolled onto a phase II evaluation of induction chemotherapy with cisplatin/fluorouracil for advanced head and neck carcinomas and had failed to achieve a partial remission after one treatment cycle. Palpable cervical tumors were heated to 40 degrees to 42 degrees C for 30 to 40 minutes, during which time cisplatin (100 mg/m2) was infused intravenously. A 5-day infusion of 5-fluorouracil (1000 mg/m2/d) followed. Despite less than a partial response to previous cisplatin/fluorouracil chemotherapy alone, two patients had complete clinical resolution of the heated tumor volume with two cycles of the combined thermochemotherapy approach. One patient achieved a partial remission with this approach. The remaining two patients died shortly after the initial thermochemotherapy treatment, as a result of progressive tumor growth. The two complete responders were subsequently treated with radiation (1 patient) and radical neck dissection (1 patient) and remained without evidence of disease 2 and 26 months after the completion of therapy, respectively. The toxicity of this combined modality approach was acceptable and appeared to be no greater than had been experienced during earlier treatment with chemotherapy alone. Further studies using a combination of these treatment modalities for locally advanced head and neck carcinomas are warranted. 
Cytomegalovirus infection in Gambian mothers and their babies. A 15 month longitudinal study of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in 178 Gambian mothers and their babies was undertaken. Twenty five (14%) of the babies were congenitally infected despite the fact that 87% of their mothers were antibody positive to the virus. Two of the 25 congenitally infected infants had evidence of severe neurological damage; skin sepsis was also a prominent feature in congenitally infected infants. The other children soon became infected. At 6 months of age, 53% of the infants were shedding virus either in urine or saliva. By the age of 12 months 86% of the infants had serological evidence of CMV infection. Preliminary evidence suggests that sibling to sibling infection in crowded compounds might be a major route of transmission. 
Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity following duodenal ulcer healing with omeprazole, sucralfate, and Maalox. Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity (PCS) have been studied in 21 duodenal ulcer patients before and after successful treatment with omeprazole (n = 7), sucralfate (n = 7), or Maalox (n = 7). The second study was carried out 3 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the sucralfate- and Maalox-treated groups and 14 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the omeprazole-treated patients. Acid output (mmol/hour) was measured as basal secretion, and in response to 0.1 microgram/kg/hour pentagastrin (low-dose) and 6.0 micrograms/kg/hour pentagastrin (high-dose) stimulation. PCS was calculated as the ratio of low dose:high dose acid output (expressed as a percentage). Ulcer healing with sucralfate resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in low-dose acid output from 36.4% (13.2-51.0) (median [range]) to 8.4% (3.2-45.4) mmol/hour and PCS from 69.1% (44.9-91.4) to 22.0% (16.0-85.6), whereas no significant decreases in any of the measured parameters were noted following ulcer healing with Maalox. Ulcer healing with omeprazole resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in basal acid output from 6.3 (1.5-22.9) (median [range]) to 2.2 (0-6.9) mmol/hour, and low-dose acid output from 31.0 (6.0-58.0) to 23.0 (1.4-44.8) mmol/hour. These findings suggest that acid secretory responses following ulcer healing vary according to the therapeutic agent used. 
Selective versus routine predischarge coronary arteriography after therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, heparin and aspirin for acute myocardial infarction. TIMI II Investigators. To ascertain whether predischarge arteriography is beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), heparin and aspirin, the outcome of 197 patients in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) IIA study assigned to conservative management and routine predischarge coronary arteriography (routine catheterization group) was compared with the outcome of 1,461 patients from the TIMI IIB study assigned to conservative management without routine coronary arteriography unless ischemia recurred spontaneously or on predischarge exercise testing (selective catheterization group). The two groups were similar with regard to important baseline variables. During the initial hospital stay, coronary arteriography was performed in 93.9% of the routine catheterization group and 34.7% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), but the frequency of coronary revascularization (angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery) was similar in the two groups (24.4% versus 20.7%, p = NS). Coronary arteriograms showed a predominance of zero or one vessel disease (stenosis greater than or equal to 60%) in both groups (routine catheterization group 73.1%, selective catheterization group 61.3%). During the 1st year after infarction, rehospitalization for cardiac reasons and the interim performance of coronary arteriography were more common in the selective catheterization group (37.9% versus 27.6%, p = 0.007 and 28.6% versus 11.6%, p less than 0.001, respectively); however, the interim rates of death, nonfatal reinfarction and performance of coronary revascularization procedures were similar. At the end of 1 year, coronary arteriography had been performed one or more times in 98.9% of the routine catheterization group and 59.4% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), whereas death and nonfatal reinfarction had occurred in 10.2% versus 7.0% (p = 0.10) and 8.6% versus 9.0% (p = 0.87), respectively. Because the selective coronary arteriography policy exposes about 40% fewer patients to the small but finite risks and inconvenience of the procedure without compromising the 1 year survival or reinfarction rates, it seems to be an appropriate management strategy. 
Safety and efficacy of oral flecainide therapy in patients with atrioventricular re-entrant tachycardia. OBJECTIVE: To assess the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of oral flecainide therapy in patients with symptomatic tachycardia and an extranodal accessory pathway. DESIGN: Open-label, uncontrolled trial with a mean follow-up of 24 months. SETTING: Referral-based, teaching medical center. PATIENTS: Sixty-three patients with symptomatic tachycardia and an extranodal accessory pathway. INTERVENTIONS: Patients had electrophysiologic testing before and after the initiation of oral flecainide therapy and were followed long-term for the presence of symptoms, new physical limitations, and adverse effects of therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Flecainide therapy prevented or slowed (324 +/- 59 ms to 398 +/- 55 ms; P less than 0.001) inducible sustained atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia in 44 of 63 patients (70%). Of the 44 patients discharged from the hospital, 33 (75%) have continued to receive flecainide therapy and have shown no adverse effects (mean follow-up, 24 +/- 10 months). Adverse cardiac reactions (proarrhythmia or sinus node suppression) attributable to flecainide occurred in 11 of 63 patients (17%); in 9 (82%) of these 11 patients, events were detected during either in-hospital monitoring or the electrophysiologic study done before discharge. Structural heart disease was detected by two-dimensional echocardiography in 8 of 11 patients who had adverse cardiac events and in 6 of 52 patients who did not have such events (P less than 0.001). Isoproterenol reversed the effects of flecainide therapy in 11 of 21 patients; 7 of the 11 patients had spontaneous clinical recurrences of tachycardia or palpitations during the follow-up period, but these symptoms occurred in only 1 of 10 patients who did not show isoproterenol-induced reversal (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Oral flecainide therapy was effective in 33 of 63 patients who had tachycardia and an extranodal accessory connection. Hospital monitoring during initial therapy is recommended, and flecainide should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with structural heart disease. An isoproterenol challenge appears to be helpful in predicting late recurrence of tachycardia. 
Motor unit firing rates in postpolio and control subjects during submaximal contraction. Postpolio patients have a deficit in strength recovery after isometric activity. The cause for this is unknown, but may be the result of higher motor unit firing rates during the activity, which leads to excessive fatigue of the motor units. The purpose of this study was to determine whether postpolio subjects recruited motor units at higher firing rates than control subjects. Twelve control and seven postpolio subjects were tested for maximal voluntary contraction of the quadriceps isometrically. Randomly, subjects performed isometric contractions for five 10-s periods freely against gravity (threshold) and at 20% and 40% of maximal voluntary contraction. Decompositional motor unit electromyographic analysis was used to measure motor unit amplitude, motor unit firing rate and counted number of motor units identified. Analysis was by univariate analysis of variance. Motor unit firing rate was not significantly greater (P greater than 0.05) in postpolio subjects than control subjects at all three levels of contraction. Thus, it is unlikely that an increased motor unit firing rate leads to the deficit in recovery of strength in postpolio subjects. 
Nutritional support in Crohn's disease: which route? Nutritional and clinical responses to three nutritional regimens were retrospectively evaluated in 81 Crohn's patients with active disease. Group 1 (n = 42) received a low residue oral diet, group 2 (n = 15) received chemically defined diets, and group 3 (n = 24), parenteral nutrition (PN). Weight gain was observed in a similar percentage of patients, whereas serum albumin increase was significant only in group 3: 3.15 +/- 0.66 versus 3.54 +/- 0.61 g/100 ml (p less than 0.05). Mean activity index decreased significantly in all groups (p less than 0.001), and length of stay in hospital was similar. Patients with intestinal obstruction had a better immediate response when submitted to PN: clinical remission was achieved in 75% of those in group 3, but in only 50% in groups 1 and 2 (p less than 0.05). Otherwise, short- and long-term outcome was similar. 
Multicenter evaluation of a new fixed-wire coronary angioplasty catheter system: clinical and angiographic characteristics and results. Coronary angioplasty is increasingly used as an attempt to revascularize patients with severe coronary artery disease. To determine the efficacy of such treatment, a new fixed wire angioplasty catheter was evaluated by a multicenter group in a non-randomized fashion in 50 patients, average 58 +/- 11 years (+/- 1 SD), 58% men. Forty-four percent had a prior revascularization procedure (28% angioplasty, 16% coronary bypass surgery), 38% had a prior Q-wave myocardial infarction, 43% had grade 4 angina, and 60% multiple vessel disease. Angioplasty was attempted in 63 lesions which were located in a mid to distal location in 69%, with a proximal tortuosity score of 1.8 (2 = 45-60 degrees entrance angle), and lesion angulation of 1.4 (1 = 45 degrees lesion bend). In 88%, the device was the primary catheter used and in 6%, it was chosen when another system failed. The balloon was able to successfully cross 94% of all lesions attempted. Six lesions were crossed and dilated but significant residual stenoses remained. There were no significant device malfunctions, or angiographic or clinical complications. This feasibility evaluation of this new fixed wire system yielded excellent angiographic results. Although not a comparative study, this analysis suggests that this new generation of angioplasty catheter may improve the safety and efficacy of complex coronary angioplasty. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of vertebrobasilar ectasia in tic convulsif. Case report. A patient with trigeminal neuralgia and hemifacial spasm was evaluated using multiplanar magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with gadolinium enhancement. Preoperative images demonstrated massively ectatic vertebral and basilar arteries and their distortion of the brain stem and the trigeminal and facial nerves. Surgical manipulation included selective trigeminal rhizotomy, cushioning of the residual nerve at the point of maximal distortion by the underlying basilar artery, and microvascular decompression of the seventh nerve from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery which was being pushed dorsomedially by the vertebral artery. Postoperatively, the patient had neither trigeminal neuralgia nor facial spasm. Gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging not only excludes other etiologies such as tumor or arteriovenous malformation, but also demonstrates cranial nerve compression by ectatic vertebral and basilar arteries. The choice of preoperative imaging modality is discussed and the literature concerning the etiology of tic convulsif is reviewed. 
Anatomic correction of transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect. Experience with 118 cases. One hundred eighteen patients, 100 with transposition of the great arteries plus ventricular septal defect and 18 with double-outlet right ventricle and subpulmonary ventricular septal defect have undergone arterial switch and patch closure of the ventricular septal defect since February 1983. In transposition of the great arteries the ventricular septal defect was perimembranous in 70 cases, trabecular in 28, and infundibular in 10. Eleven patients had multiple ventricular septal defects. In addition to 18 patients with double-outlet right ventricle, malalignment of the conal septum was present in 19 cases. Coronary type A distribution was recognized in 79 cases, type C in one, type D in 24, and type E in 14. Great arteries were side by side in 19% of cases. Aortic coarctation was present in 31 cases, and subaortic obstruction in 9. Age at operation ranged from 4 days to 4 years (mean, 3.5 +/- 8.3 months), and mean weight was 4.0 +/- 1.6 kg. Thirty-seven infants were younger than age 1 month. Thirty-six patients underwent previous operations: pulmonary artery banding alone (n = 13), pulmonary artery banding and coarctation repair (n = 13), and coarctation repair alone (n = 10). Mean time between the first procedure and the switch was 2.2 months. Six patients with aortic coarctation underwent one-stage repair, through median sternotomy, aortic reconstruction, closure of the ventricular septal defect, and arterial switch. Perioperative mortality was 13.5% (70% confidence limit 10% to 17.6%, n = 16). It was directly related to coronary artery kinking in 50% of deaths and to anatomy and size discrepancy of the great arteries in the remaining deaths. Univariate analysis could not find any significant risk factor of in-hospital mortality. Mean follow-up of 30.3 +/- 23.5 months was achieved in all but 2 survivors. There was one late death. Ten patients underwent 11 reoperations for recoarctation (n = 1), pulmonary stenosis (n = 7), residual ventricular septal defect (n = 2), and stenosis of superior vena cava (n = 1). Two patients needed a permanent pacemaker. Actuarial survival and freedom from reoperation at 5 years were 84.5% +/- 3.6% and 85.7% +/- 4.6%, respectively. We conclude that anatomic correction of complex transposition is a safe method that offers good early and midterm results. 
Progressive deterioration of auditory evoked potentials after excision of an acoustic neurinoma: case report. The authors report the case of a 17-year-old girl who underwent excision of bilateral neurinomas of the cerebellopontine angle. Although her auditory evoked potentials were well maintained during the operation, they deteriorated gradually and progressively for the following 2 months. This seemed to reflect degeneration of the cochlear nerve fibers initiated by operative manipulation in the cerebellopontine angle in a patient who had no hearing when she awoke from surgery. 
von Hippel-Lindau disease: inadequacy of angiography for identification of renal cancers. Selective renal angiograms were retrospectively evaluated for the identification of renal cell cancers in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). Seven patients underwent angiography and surgery because of solid or complex renal masses identified at cross-sectional imaging. Nine kidneys underwent detailed examination by the surgeon and by a pathologist. There were 31 renal cancers. Angiography had enabled identification of only five cancers (16%), and six others (19%) had been suspected. Cancers detected angiographically were larger than those not detected (P less than .05). Solid tumors tended to appear less hypervascular than expected and occasionally had the angiographic appearance of atypical cysts. There were no false-positive angiograms. Angiography revealed only one cancer not previously suspected and changed the surgeon's approach for only one kidney (11%). The sensitivity and specificity of angiography were 35% and 100%, respectively. In these patients, selective renal angiography is not helpful for the detection or exclusion of cancer in a kidney. It does not have a limited role for vascular mapping prior to partial nephrectomy or tumor enucleation. 
Abnormal hormonal and renal responses to saline load in hypertensive patients with parental history of cardiovascular accidents. BACKGROUND. Acute cardiac and cerebrovascular accidents are more frequent in hypertensive subjects with a family history of acute vascular accidents. The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to vascular disease in these subjects are unknown. We investigated whether a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke in hypertensive subjects is associated with abnormalities of sodium handling. METHODS AND RESULTS. Patients with mild, uncomplicated essential hypertension were divided into two subgroups according to family history: a subgroup with a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke (FV+, n = 18) and a subgroup with a family history completely negative for vascular accidents (FV-, n = 14). The two subgroups were comparable with respect to age, weight, sex distribution, blood pressure, duration of hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, and organ damage. Baseline plasma renin activity (PRA), concentrations of aldosterone (PA), atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and norepinephrine, and urinary electrolyte excretion were also comparable in the two subgroups. Despite these similarities, the responses to an acute saline load, measured under controlled metabolic and experimental conditions, were different in the two subgroups. In the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes of saline load, PRA fell by 1.0 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/hr and PA concentration by 89.4 +/- 26 pg/ml and ANF concentration increased by 38 +/- 9 pg/ml, whereas in the FV- subgroup the corresponding responses were -2.3 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.005), -190 +/- 43 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and 80 +/- 13 pg/ml (p less than 0.005), respectively. Urinary sodium excretion was delayed in the FV+ subgroup (270 +/- 67 mu eq/min at 60 minutes) compared with the FV- subgroup (555 +/- 157 mu eq/min at 60 minutes, p less than 0.05). At 120 minutes of saline load, significant (p less than 0.005) differences in PRA and ANF concentration were still observed. In a control group of eight normal subjects the responses to a saline load were comparable to those in the FV- subgroup but greater than those in the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide evidence that the hormonal and renal adjustments to an acute salt load are impaired in hypertensive patients with a parental history of vascular accidents. We speculate that abnormalities of sodium handling may represent markers of a more rapid development of vascular injury in human hypertension. 
Rare intrathoracic complications in acute pancreatitis. Ascites and pleural effusions may complicate pancreatitis but pericarditis with pericardial effusion and tamponade is rare and necrosis of mediastinal fat has not been described before. All these complications occurred in the case reported here. 
Gentamicin and vancomycin removal by continuous venovenous hemofiltration. The dispositions and dose requirements for vancomycin and gentamicin were investigated in a 58-year-old man who was receiving long-term continuous venovenous hemofiltration. Estimates of clearance were obtained using a Bayesian parameter estimation program and stayed remarkably consistent throughout the therapy. Single daily doses of both vancomycin and gentamicin generally maintained the profiles for both drugs around the target ranges of peak 5-10 mg/L (gentamicin) and 25-40 mg/L (vancomycin) and trough less than 2 mg/L (gentamicin) and less than 10 mg/L (vancomycin). 
Spinal cord herniation associated with an intradural spinal arachnoid cyst diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging. Two rare cases of spinal cord herniation associated with intradural spinal arachnoid cyst are reported. A preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated the presence of spinal cord herniation, identified as a protrusion continuous with the spinal cord. Surgery upon the intradural spinal arachnoid cyst improved progressive neurological dysfunction. The authors postulate that spinal cord herniation occurred for the following reason: The pressure of the intradural arachnoid cyst on the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord caused thinning of the dura, leading to a tear and, thus, the development of an extradural arachnoid cyst. Along with the enlargement of intradural arachnoid cyst, the spinal cord herniated through the tear in the dura into the extradural arachnoid cyst. 
Spinal cord schistosomiasis: a pediatric case mimicking intrinsic cord neoplasm. We present the clinical, myelographic, MRI, and histologic data on a 7-year-old girl with confirmed Schistosoma mansoni infection of the spinal cord. MRI of the granulomatous spinal lesion revealed extensive enlargement of the cord in the T11-12 area, with some intramedullary swelling extending to T-5 through T-7. The clinical manifestations of spinal schistosomiasis can be diverse, and there should be a high index of suspicion for all patients from endemic areas. 
Collagen stability and collagenolytic activity in the normal and aneurysmal human abdominal aorta. Two issues were addressed in this study. The first was whether a bona fide collagenase exists within the wall of the aorta. The second was whether the activity of this putative collagenase is greater in aneurysmal tissue. No collagenase could be extracted from the wall of the aorta under nondenaturing conditions. However, hydroxyproline was liberated from tissue samples allowed to autolyze at neutral pH under reaction conditions favoring the activity of collagenase. Such an activity was probably enzymic as it occurred in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion and was suppressed by chelators. In normal and stenotic tissue, activity was increased by adding aminophenylmercuric acetate, an activator of latent collagenase. Examination of the blanks revealed that the collagen of aneurysmal aorta was more soluble than normal. Furthermore, its digestion kinetics differed in a way that suggested that aneurysmal aorta possessed a labile component that was absent from normal tissue. Although the activity of the putative aortic collagenase was higher than normal in the aneurysmal tissue, our assays do not distinguish between changes in the amount or activity of the enzyme and alterations in the collagen. 
Late follow-up after repair of left ventricular aneurysm and (usually) associated coronary bypass grafting. This study assesses clinical and operative data (LV) aneurysm was repaired to determine factors that might predict in-hospital and long-term outcome. Long-term follow-up study was obtained in 296 of 298 patients undergoing LV aneurysm repair with or without coronary artery bypass grafting between 1974 and 1986. No patient had sustained a myocardial infarction within 2 weeks of surgery or was undergoing other concurrent cardiac surgery. The average age of the study patients was 57 +/- 9 years and the average ejection fraction was 35 +/- 13%. Ninety percent of the patients underwent concurrent bypass grafting, with an average of 2.2 +/- 1.3 grafts placed. Fourteen (5%) patients died in the hospital, with most deaths attributable to LV dysfunction. Advanced age and less extensive revascularization were correlates of in-hospital mortality. The 10-year survival was 57%, myocardial infarction-free survival 43%, and freedom from death, myocardial infarction and reoperative coronary surgery 41%. Advanced age, systemic hypertension, significant left main coronary artery narrowing and emergent operative status were multivariate correlates of long-term mortality. A low-risk population was defined by the absence of these risk factors, and high-risk by the presence of greater than or equal to 1 risk factors. The 10-year survival was 71% in the low-risk and 41% in the high-risk groups (p = .0006). The 10-year myocardial infarction free survival was 55% in the low-risk and 31% in the high-risk groups (p = 0.0017). LV aneurysm repair may be performed with acceptable in-hospital mortality, and the long-term risk may be stratified. 
Insulin resistance after surgery: normalization by insulin treatment. 1. Injury is known to be associated with variable degrees of tissue insensitivity to insulin. We measured insulin resistance in a group of non-obese, glucose-tolerant patients undergoing major elective surgery with an uncomplicated post-operative course. 2. Shortly after surgery, hyperglycaemia (7.3 +/- 0.6 versus 4.2 +/- 0.3 mmol/l glucose pre-surgery, mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01) with normal insulin concentrations (73 +/- 15 versus 64 +/- 18 pmol/l) suggested the presence of insulin resistance. Counter-regulatory hormones were raised, whole-body protein oxidation was doubled (P less than 0.01) and energy expenditure was up by 18% (P less than 0.01). 3. Insulin sensitivity was quantified by clamping plasma glucose concentrations at 5.6 mmol/l during 24 h of total parenteral nutrition (15% protein, 55% glucose and 30% fat, supplying 1.25 times the measured resting energy expenditure) with a variable infusion of exogenous insulin. After surgery, eight times more insulin was needed than before surgery (14.14 +/- 1.15 versus 1.78 +/- 0.29 pmol min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.001) to maintain euglycemia. 4. After surgery, stimulation of net carbohydrate oxidation (18.8 +/- 1.4 versus 17.2 +/- 1.8 mumol min-1 kg-1 preoperatively, not significant), suppression of lipolysis and lipid oxidation and inhibition of ketogenesis occurred to the same extent as before surgery. Of the infused nutrients, the glucose was all oxidized, amino acids replaced endogenous protein losses (= neutral nitrogen balance) and lipids were stored. Insulin administration caused no further increment in oxygen consumption or energy expenditure. 
Renal effects of ANF (95-126), a new atrial peptide analogue, in dogs with experimental heart failure. Atrial natriuretic factor 95-126 [ANF (95-126)] is a novel 32 amino acid peptide which is thought to originate from the kidney. The systemic hemodynamic and renal effects of equimolar doses of intravenous synthetic ANF (95-126) and synthetic alpha ANF (99-126) were examined in normal dogs (n = 6) and in dogs with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula and chronic compensated high-output heart failure (n = 5). ANF (95-126) and alpha ANF (99-126) were infused at 5 and 10 pmol/kg/min for 75-min periods each. In the normal and AV fistula dogs the two peptides similarly decreased mean arterial pressures and right atrial pressures (P less than .05). Creatinine clearance and urinary volume excretion increased (P less than .05) in the normal dogs with both peptides, but only ANF (95-126) produced significant elevations (P less than .05) of these two parameters in the AV fistula animals. With the highest infusion dose, ANF (95-126) increased urinary sodium excretion to at least twice the levels observed with alpha ANF (99-126) in both groups of dogs (P less than .05). The decreases in plasma renin and aldosterone were comparable for the two peptides in both groups of animals. These results indicate that ANF (95-126) is more potent than alpha ANF (99-126) for the promotion of a natriuresis, particularly in AV fistula dogs with compensated high-output heart failure, in which the sodium excretory actions of alpha ANF (99-126) were attenuated markedly. 
Percutaneous biopsy of left adrenal masses: prevalence of pancreatitis after anterior approach. Acute pancreatitis is an unusual but recognized complication of percutaneous aspiration biopsy of the pancreas. As the pancreatic tail is located anterior to the left adrenal gland, percutaneous biopsy of a left adrenal mass via the anterior approach may result in needle passage through the tail of the pancreas with subsequent potential development of pancreatitis. To evaluate this risk, we retrospectively reviewed 48 CT-directed percutaneous aspiration biopsies of left adrenal masses done between 1984 and 1989 at two institutions. Positioning of the patient, the course of the needle, the number of needle passes, and the size of the needle were analyzed. Thirty-three (69%) of 48 biopsies of a left adrenal mass were performed by using the anterior approach. The pancreas was traversed by one or more needles in 32 of 33 cases. Biopsies were performed with 20- to 22-gauge needles, and the number of needle passes varied widely. The medical records of the 33 patients in whom the anterior approach was used also were reviewed for complications. Acute pancreatitis, which required 11-13 days of hospitalization, developed in two patients (6%). None of the other 31 patients suffered a complication. We conclude that the pancreatic tail is routinely traversed by the biopsy needle when biopsy of a left adrenal mass is done via the anterior approach and that severe acute pancreatitis can occur as a result. 
Changes of DNA methylation and chromatin structure in the human myeloperoxidase gene during myeloid differentiation. Expression of the myeloperoxidase (MPO) gene is tightly regulated in a tissue- and development-specific manner. Accumulation of MPO messenger RNA (mRNA) occurs only at the late myeloblastic and promyelocytic stages of myeloid differentiation and is negligible at other stages of myeloid development and in other tissues. The goal of our studies was to begin to understand the events that occur to control MPO gene expression during normal granulocytopoiesis. Chromatin structure of the MPO gene was evaluated by DNase I treatment of isolated nuclei and Southern blot analysis. No detectable DNase I hypersensitive sites were found in the region of the MPO gene in non-myeloid cells. One site was present in the 5' upstream region in myeloid cells that are developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Three sites of hypersensitivity in the regions of the putative MPO promoter and upstream region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. These sites were markedly reduced in terminally differentiated, non-expressing myeloid cells. Analysis of DNA methylation of the MPO gene using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes showed that the gene was highly methylated in non-myeloid cells. Stepwise demethylation occurred in myeloid cells developmentally too immature to transcribe MPO. Maximal demethylation in the 5' gene region occurred in MPO-expressing promyelocytes. This methylation pattern did not change in terminally differentiated, MPO non-expressing myeloid cells. A somatic hybrid cell formed by fusion of HL-60 (MPO-expressing cells) and PUT (MPO non-expressing lymphoid cells) extinguished expression of MPO and showed a chimeric pattern of MPO gene methylation, suggesting that demethylation is necessary but not sufficient for expression of the MPO gene. Our studies show that demethylation and DNase I hypersensitivity of the MPO gene were associated with a tissue-dependent potential for MPO gene expression that preceded the developmental ability to express MPO mRNA. 
Genetic susceptibility to Parkinson's disease. Genetic factors clearly cause Lewy-body Parkinson's disease (PD) in a subset of autosomal-dominant families. However, most cases of PD are sporadic. The two most likely models of four discussed for sporadic PD are the reduced penetrance model and the multifactorial model. Sporadic PD is likely to be caused by the combined effect of environmental precipitating factors and genetic susceptibility factors. Because the number of major genetic factors is likely to be small, these hypotheses can be tested and genetic factors located using linkage mapping techniques. The affected pair analysis methods are especially suited to PD. Finding the genetic susceptibility factors for PD is important because this may be the fastest way to identify the environmental precipitating factors and because it may lead to prevention of PD. Because of the usefulness of identifying genetic susceptibility factors for PD, we are carrying out linkage studies in a group of 16 large autosomal-dominant families with PD and more than 300 living affected PD pairs. 
Tardive dyskinesia and chronic pain. Psychotropic drugs are frequently used to treat chronic pain. Tardive dyskinesia is a serious complication of such therapy, but is not mentioned in the pain literature. Two cases are reported and the implications discussed. 
Fracture line in post head injury optic nerve damage. Diminution of vision following head injuries involving the optic canal is not uncommon. In order to find out how a blunt trauma to the frontotemporal region produced damage to the optic nerve in its canalicular portion, this study was conducted on cadaveric skulls and its results are described. 
Auscultation with an esophageal stethoscope. A new test for pneumoperitoneum. Auscultation for the tympanic sound characteristic of developing pneumoperitoneum during insufflation of the abdomen at laparoscopy was performed with an esophageal stethoscope. Such auscultation detected pneumoperitoneum as soon as or sooner than did the other, standard methods to which it was compared. This test requires no additional maneuvers beyond those routine in standard laparoscopic and anesthetic procedures, providing a useful adjunctive test for pneumoperitoneum acquisition. 
Benign arterial dissections of the posterior circulation. Four young adults with spontaneous dissection of the vertebrobasilar system are reported. Clinically, two patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and two with brain-stem ischemia. In two cases of ruptured arterial dissection of the posterior cerebral artery, angiography demonstrated fusiform and "sausage-like" dilatation of the involved vessel. In two cases of occlusive dissection of the basilar artery, angiography revealed the typical "string sign." All four patients were treated conservatively: three survive in good clinical condition and one remains disabled. Follow-up angiograms showed spontaneous healing of the lesion with return to an almost normal arterial configuration in two cases; residual narrowing corresponding to the dissection was the most notable finding in the other two. It is recommended that, in a subset of neurologically stable patients, angiographic monitoring is undertaken to assess the tendency for spontaneous repair before surgical intervention is planned. 
Presence of PAF-acether in stool of patients with pouch ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis. Platelet-activating factor is an endogenous phospholipid produced by a wide variety of inflammatory cells. Platelet-activating factor induces severe pathological changes in various organs and, among numerous potent effects, causes bowel necrosis. Pouchitis is a poorly understood complication of ileoanal pouch anastomosis which occurs in patients who undergo surgery for ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to measure ileal or fecal platelet-activating factor and lyso platelet-activating factor contents in normal volunteers (n = 12), in patients with terminal ileostomy (n = 7), and in patients with ileoanal anastomosis (n = 15) (8 patients have pouchitis defined by the presence of ulcerations on the reservoir). Fecal samples were processed and assessed for platelet-activating factor by platelet aggregation assay. The aggregating material was further characterized as platelet-activating factor by the following: inhibition of the platelet aggregation it induced by specific platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist (BN 52021; IHB, Le Plessis Robinson, France); abolition of platelet aggregation after incubation with phospholipase A2 but not with lipase A1; and retention time on high-performance liquid chromatography. Stool platelet-activating factor content (in nanograms per gram of stool, mean +/- 1SD) was significantly increased in patients with pouchitis (22.2 +/- 16 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (1.59 +/- 0.63 ng/g, P less than 0.01), terminal ileostomy (0.59 +/- 0.43 ng/g, P less than 0.01), and healthy controls (0 +/- 0 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.001). Lyso platelet-activating factor (nanograms per gram of stool) was increased in patients with pouchitis (10,704 +/- 5499 ng/g) compared with patients with normal reservoir (4721 +/- 4549 ng/g of stool, P less than 0.05), terminal ileostomy (3042 +/- 4019 ng/g, P less than 0.02), and healthy volunteers (128 +/- 107 ng/g, P less than 0.001). In patients with ileoanal anastomosis and pouchitis, increased platelet-activating factor production could be implicated in the inflammation and ulcerations observed in the reservoir. 
Quinine-induced immune thrombocytopenia associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome: a new clinical entity. Three patients are described who developed severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute renal failure after ingestion of quinine. In one patient, the same clinical findings recurred several months later after another exposure to quinine. Serum from one patient contained quinine-dependent IgG antibodies reactive with the platelet glycoprotein (GP) Ib/IX complex. In the second and third cases, serum contained IgG and IgM antibodies reactive with both the GP Ib/IX and IIb/IIIa complexes in the presence of quinine. Quinine appears to have induced both immune thrombocytopenia and the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in these individuals. Findings made in these cases may have implications for the pathogenesis of some forms of HUS. 
Managing the care of patients with dementia. How to maximize level of functioning and minimize behavior problems. Effective treatment of patients with dementia involves supporting and educating the primary caregiver, uncovering and correcting the underlying cause of any decompensation that may occur, and deciding when drug therapy is appropriate. Caregivers must be taught how to cope with the patient's denial and how to modify the patient's environment so that it is safe and easy to understand. Pharmacologic therapy for depression accompanying dementia can improve a patient's quality of life and independence considerably; drugs may also be of help in dealing with patients who resist care. Psychotic symptoms usually do not require pharmacologic treatment, and hypnotics should, if possible, be avoided as a solution to sleep problems. 
Revision osteoarticular allograft transplantation in weight-bearing joints. A clinical review. The early results of revision osteoarticular allografts in weight-bearing joints are reported. Sixteen consecutive patients underwent surgery over a six-year period between 1982 and 1988. At the time of review eight patients (50%) had surviving second allografts with an average follow-up time of 48 months (range 12 to 87). Five patients were graded excellent according to the Mankin scale, one good and two fair. Eight patients (50%) required further surgery, but only two patients came to amputation. 
Inorganic mercury transport in the proximal tubule of the rabbit. Inorganic mercury transport was studied in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of the isolated perfused proximal tubule of the rabbit. The concentration of mercury in the perfusate was 18.4 microM. At this concentration all three segments of the proximal tubule underwent degenerative changes that proceeded to cellular necrosis at the end of the tubule which was attached to the perfusion pipet. This pathological process progressed along the tubule for approximately 200 microns. The remainder of the tubule, to the collection pipette, remained intact and free of any pathological changes. In examining the transport of mercury under these condition, it was found that, on average, the S1, S2, and S3 segments all removed inorganic mercury from the luminal fluid at approximately 140 fmol min-1 mm-1. The transport of mercury, as measured by the appearance of 203Hg in the bathing solution, was 80% lower than the removal of 203Hg from the luminal fluid. The mercury appearing in the bath could be accounted for by passive leakage through the necrotic portion of the tubule in the S1 and S2 segments, but not in the S3 segment. Leakage could account for only 16.2% of the transepithelial movement of inorganic mercury in the S3 segment. Inorganic mercury taken up by the tubule (92%) was primarily associated with the structural proteins of the tubular epithelial cells, while very little (8%) was found in the tubular extract. The toxicity of inorganic mercury was determined by titration. Perfusion with 1 microM inorganic mercury produced necrosis. The pathological features appeared to be the same as those resulting with 18.5 microM inorganic mercury. 
Colorectal ornithine decarboxylase activity in human mucosa and tumors: elevation of enzymatic activity in distal mucosa. To examine the value of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) assay as a biological marker of potential malignancy in large bowel, we harvested 43 colorectal carcinoma, 7 adenoma, 6 polyps, and 77 normal-appearing mucosa at surgery from patients with colorectal carcinoma. In addition, 13 normal rectal mucosa were obtained at biopsy from patients with benign diseases or diseases unrelated to colorectal carcinoma as normal control. ODC activity was significantly higher in polyps and adenocarcinomas than in normal-appearing mucosa from patients with colorectal carcinoma. ODC activity in normal-appearing mucosa varied throughout the large intestine, with significantly higher activities in the distal segment of the large bowel. The higher ODC activity detected in the sigmoid colon and rectum correlates with the larger incidence of tumor development in this region of the large bowel. This observation needs to be taken into consideration when ODC activities of the colorectal mucosa are measured as biological markers of potential malignancies. 
Pheochromocytoma of the urinary bladder. A case of pheochromocytoma of the bladder involving a ureteral orifice is presented, with a review of the literature. We discuss general management principles of bladder pheochromocytoma and factors specific to the management of our case, which allowed complete removal of the benign tumor while preserving bladder and ureteral function. Imaging modalities for localizing extraadrenal pheochromocytomas are reviewed. 
The concept of uterine preservation with ovarian malignancies. A 30-year-old woman with bilateral, recurrent, borderline papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary was treated with bilateral oophorocystectomy and omentectomy with uterine preservation. Ten years later, through induction of an artificial endometrial cycle and ovum donation, she conceived twins and delivered two healthy infants. Staging exploratory laparotomy at the time of cesarean delivery was negative for malignancy. This case illustrates the value of uterine preservation for cases in which classical teaching has indicated hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy. 
Comparison of the effects of atenolol and nifedipine on glucose, insulin, and lipid metabolism in patients with hypertension. Various aspects of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism have been studied in two groups of patients with mild hypertension before and after four months of treatment with either nifedipine (n = 12) or atenolol (n = 12). Mean (+/- SEM) blood pressure fell to the same degree following treatment with either nifedipine (147 +/- 3/98 +/- 2 to 134 +/- 2/85 +/- 2 mm Hg) or atenolol (149 +/- 3/99 +/- 2 to 135 +/- 2/86 +/- 3 mm Hg). Circulating plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations were measured at hourly intervals from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, before and after breakfast (8:00 AM), and at lunch time (noon). The response to treatment was different in the two groups. Specifically, plasma glucose concentration were unchanged and insulin concentrations were higher in association with atenolol treatment. In contrast, nifedipine-treated patients had similar plasma insulin, but lower plasma glucose and triglyceride concentrations after four months of therapy. The changes in day-long plasma glucose and insulin responses suggested that resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake had increased in association with atenolol treatment and decreased following nifedipine. This conclusion was supported in that measurement of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal showed a decrease in atenolol-treated patients and an increase in nifedipine-treated patients. Finally, plasma lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations did not change following atenolol therapy, whereas plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased in association with nifedipine administration. These data show that changes in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism observed with treatment of mild hypertension can vary significantly as a function of the drug used, despite similar beneficial effects on blood pressure. 
Toxicity and immunomodulatory effects of interleukin-2 after autologous bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) for advanced hematologic malignancies is associated with high relapse rates. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells represent a potentially non-cross-resistant therapeutic modality that might prevent or delay relapses if used early after ABMT at a time when the tumor burden is minimal. However, high-dose chemoradiotherapy and ABMT might increase patients' susceptibility to IL-2 toxicity, and might interfere with immunologic responses to IL-2 in vivo. Therefore, to determine safety, tolerance, and immunomodulatory effects of IL-2 therapy early after ABMT, IL-2 was administered by continuous intravenous infusion to 16 patients 14 to 91 days (median, 33) after ABMT for acute leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma. Patients were sequentially assigned to escalating IL-2 "induction" doses (0.3 to 4.5 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 1 to 5), and all patients received a nonescalating IL-2 "maintenance" dose (0.3 x 10(6) U/m2/d, days 12 to 21). Most patients exhibited mild to moderate fever, nausea, diarrhea, and/or skin rash with IL-2 infusions. The maximum tolerated "induction" dose was 3.0 x 10(6) U/m2/d; dose-limiting toxicities were hypotension and thrombocytopenia. All toxicities reversed on stopping the IL-2 infusions, and all patients completed "maintenance." Postinfusion lymphocytosis was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. With the higher IL-2 doses, increased percentages of patients' PBMC expressed CD16 and CD56, with augmented lysis of K562 and Daudi, reflecting the induction of natural killer and circulating LAK effector activities. Increased LAK precursor activity was exhibited by patients at all IL-2 dose levels. Thus, the IL-2 therapy regimen was safely tolerated after ABMT, and pronounced immunomodulatory effects were observed with the higher IL-2 doses. These studies support the planned use of IL-2 and LAK cells after ABMT in an attempt to reduce relapses of advanced hematologic malignancies. 
Evaluation of indium-111-labeled antifibrin monoclonal antibody for the diagnosis of venous thrombotic disease The potential advantage of using 111In-antifibrin (111In-AF) monoclonal antibody for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was studied in 44 patients with suspected DVT (27 underwent heparin therapy before 111In-AF injection). All patients had contrast venography (considered as the gold standard) and 111In-AF scintigraphy within 24 hr. Two to 3 mCi of 111In-AF were injected intravenously, and planar scintigraphy of the limbs was recorded within 10 min (17 times), 3 hr (44 times), and 18 hr (39 times). Indium-111-AF images were then interpreted without knowledge of the results of the other examinations. The DVT diagnostic accuracy of 111In-AF was greater when interpretation was based on images recorded at different time periods after injection. Indium-111-AF sensitivity for diagnosis of DVT was 85% (29/34) and was not apparently decreased by heparin therapy. None of the 10 patients with negative contrast venography had a positive 111In-AF scan. The results demonstrate the importance of recording serial images and the excellent accuracy of 111In-AF for diagnosing DVT. 
The stomach in liver cirrhosis. Endoscopic, morphological, and clinical correlations. The stomachs of cirrhotic patients are frequently subject to a number of alterations, detectable by endoscopy, the presence of which indicates a disturbance in the mucosa. Several investigators believe that portal hypertension plays an etiopathogenetic role. Three groups of subjects were studied prospectively: 83 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension, 53 cirrhotic patients without portal hypertension, and 135 control subjects. Snake skin, scarlatina rash, and petechia were the most frequent endoscopic findings in the cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension (P less than 0.001); these findings were also most frequently present in association with each other in this group. There was no correlation between the endoscopic findings, the clinical gravity of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade), and the gravity of esophageal varices (Beppu score). There were no characteristic inflammatory findings in the gastric mucosa. Hypergastrinemia was often observed in cirrhotic patients with and without angiodysplasias. 
Different lectin-binding patterns in primary breast cancers and their metastases. The expression of glycoconjugates in primary tumors and their metastases in 18 consecutive cases of metastasized breast cancer was studied by use of lectin histochemistry. Paraffin sections were stained with a panel of seven fluorochrome-labeled lectins with defined sugar specificities. The study revealed variation in the lectin binding patterns of individual cancers. In the primary tumors the lectin reactivity was diversified, whereas in their respective metastases it was rather homogeneous. This finding indicates that there is intratumoral heterogeneity in the primary cancers, whereas the selected subclones of malignant cells with restricted glycoconjugate expression seem to give rise to metastases. 
Pyridostigmine used as a nerve agent pretreatment under wartime conditions. OBJECTIVE. To determine the adverse effects of pretreatment with pyridostigmine bromide for nerve agent exposure during wartime. DESIGN. A retrospective study. SETTING. Southwest Asia. PARTICIPANTS. Personnel who provided medical support to the XVIII Airborne Corps. These medical officers supplied information pertaining to symptoms and disposition of 41,650 soldiers who received pyridostigmine at the onset of hostilities of Operation Desert Storm. INTERVENTION. Pyridostigmine bromide, 30 mg orally, was self-administered every 8 hours while under the threat of nerve agent attack (for 1 to 7 days). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. Physiologic changes attributable to pyridostigmine that resulted in need for medical attention, discontinuation of the drug, hospitalization, and/or evacuation from Southwest Asia. RESULTS. About half of the population noted physiologic changes that were not incapacitating, such as increased flatus, abdominal cramps, soft stools, and urinary urgency. Approximately 1% of the soldiers believed they had effects that warranted medical attention, but fewer than 0.1% had effects sufficient to discontinue the drug. Nonincapacitating symptoms often occurred; however, military mission performance was not impaired. CONCLUSION. While under the threat of nerve agent attack, pyridostigmine can be administered to virtually all soldiers. 
Phase I/II trial of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Forty-seven patients with hematologic neoplasia received recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) by daily 2-hour infusion following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors in a phase I-II dose-escalation trial. Dose levels ranged from 30 to 500 micrograms/m2/d. At doses at or below 250 micrograms/m2/d, toxicity felt to be caused by rhGM-CSF was negligible. However, three of five patients treated with 500 micrograms/m2/d had unacceptable side effects caused by rhGM-CSF. Two different graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimens were administered. Twenty-seven evaluable patients were administered regimens that did not contain methotrexate (MTX) (Group I) and reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL by a median of day 14. In contrast, 18 patients who received GVHD prophylactic regimens containing MTX (Group II) reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL on a median of day 20. Patients in Group I had fewer febrile days and, of those discharged, had shorter initial hospitalizations than patients in Group II. The overall incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade 2 or greater) in the rhGM-CSF-treated patients was 28% and was similar to that in historical "good risk" patients who did not receive rhGM-CSF. These preliminary data suggest rhGM-CSF is unlikely to exacerbate GVHD in HLA-identical sibling donor transplants and indicate the need for randomized trials of rhGM-CSF in allogeneic marrow transplant patients. 
Diffusion-weighted MR imaging of the brain: value of differentiating between extraaxial cysts and epidermoid tumors. This study demonstrates the use of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in improving the specificity of the diagnosis of extraaxial brain tumors. Three surgically proved lesions (one arachnoid cyst and two epidermoid tumors) and two nonsurgically proved lesions (arachnoid and ependymal cysts) were evaluated with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo studies followed by intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MR imaging. The IVIM images of the lesions were displayed as an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image obtained at 0.65 G/cm (maximum gradient b value = 100 sec/mm2) and compared with external oil and water phantoms. The ADC of arachnoid cysts was similar to stationary water whereas the ADC of epidermoid tumors was similar to brain parenchyma, indicating the solid nature and the slower diffusion rate of the epidermoid tumors. Cisternal CSF demonstrated uniformly high ADC, primarily because of bulk flow, which enhanced image contrast. Improved delineation of postsurgical changes was also possible. Our preliminary results show that diffusion-weighted MR imaging can be useful in distinguishing between arachnoid cysts and epidermoid tumors. 
Invasive Chrysosporium infection of the nose and paranasal sinuses in an immunocompromised host. Aggressive fungal rhinosinusitis with Chrysosporium sp. occurred in a patient with acute lymphocytic leukemia. The infecting organism is an exceedingly rare human pathogen. Usually, human chrysosporial infections are mild and unmarked by symptoms. Most case reports appear in the pathology literature and describe the incidental finding of adiaspores in the pulmonary parenchyma at autopsy. Clinical disease from active growth of chrysosporial mycelia in human tissues has been noted on a porcine aortic valve prosthesis and in a tibial abscess. Hyphal elements were not recovered from any other body parts of these patients. Histopathologic and microbiologic studies permitted the identification of this rarely encountered organism. Our patient experienced systemic spread of Chrysosporium organisms. Treatment of this pathogen is the same as for other opportunistic fungal infections. 
Conventional versus laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the randomized controlled trial. Cholecystectomy Study Group We considered using a randomized trial to assess the value of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in the treatment of symptomatic gallstones. The pros and cons for the timing of such a trial were in favour of not beginning the trial until surgeons learned to use the new procedure safely and effectively, and until key endpoints and outcome indices could be identified and assessed using valid measures. Instead an observational study was implemented to monitor the learning curve of surgeons as they mastered the laparoscopic equipment and procedures, and to assess the responses of the patients to the procedure. In the first 100 patients, the procedure proved to be as safe and feasible to use as conventional surgery, and there were strong benefits in terms of quicker recovery of the patients with less pain, discomfort, and a reduced length of hospital stay. The responses of the surgeons and the patients to the new procedure now place ethical constraints on the planning of a randomized controlled trial. Currently, comprehensive surveillance and monitoring of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the only realistic method with which to assess the impact of this new technology in our clinic. 
The radiology of headache. The patient who presents with a severe and acute headache should be evaluated radiographically with CT. The key diagnosis to make in this situation is hemorrhage, either subarachnoid or intraparenchymal. Computed tomography is more sensitive to acute hemorrhage than is MRI. When the patient is stable, MRI frequently contributes information to narrow the diagnostic possibilities, because vascular malformations and certain parenchymal lesions have a characteristic appearance on MRI. Hydrocephalus may also present acutely and is easily seen on CT or MRI. In a patient may show WMF and atrophy. The patient with trigeminal neuropathy may demonstrate central or peripheral lesions. In temporomandibular joint dysfunction, conventional tomography and MRI are frequently used. Magnetic resonance imaging shows excellent detail of the disk and surrounding soft tissues, whereas tomography better demonstrates bony changes. When a history of trauma is present, MRI may show a subacute subdural hematoma. These collections are easily seen on MRI, even when isodense on CT. Evidence of old shear injury is also well seen on MRI. Finally, neoplastic, inflammatory, congenital, and idiopathic sources of headache may be demonstrated by either MRI or CT, depending on presentation. MRI will generally show superior characterization. 
Successful removal of massive intragastric gallstones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy and mechanical lithotripsy. We describe a case of massive gallstones discharged into the stomach through a cholecystoduodenal fistula and the successful removal of these stones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EEHL) and endoscopic mechanical lithotripsy (EML) for the prevention of gallstone ileus. A 60-yr-old woman was admitted with epigastric pain and nausea. Upper gastrointestinal tract examination demonstrated backflow of contrast medium from the duodenal bulb into the gallbladder. Endoscopic examination revealed a large fistula on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, and two brown stones (about 3 cm in diameter) were found in the stomach. To prevent gallstone ileus, removal of these stones was attempted. They were broken into pieces by EEHL, then crushed into smaller pieces by EML and removed orally. Chemical analysis showed the composition of the gallstones to be at least 98% cholesterol. The patient was discharged one month after removal of the gallstones and has remained asymptomatic. 
Reactive arthritis due to hidradenitis suppurativa mimicking osteomyelitis. We have reported a case of erosive arthritis of the hand preceding the appearance of hidradenitis suppurativa in the ipsilateral axilla, which was mistaken for osteomyelitis. Recognition of this presentation is important to avoid unnecessary invasive diagnostic procedures and to initiate prompt treatment directed at the underlying cause. 
Ovarian cancer screening. For populations in which preventive measures have been applied for the more common causes of death, the early detection of ovarian cancer becomes the next focus of efforts to reduce premature death among women. Data regarding the effectiveness of ultrasonography in detecting early-stage ovarian cancer are reviewed. Ultrasonography is more sensitive than pelvic examination in detecting ovarian abnormalities but lacks specificity in distinguishing benign from malignant ovarian lesions. Combined with serum CA 125 levels, ultrasonography may provide an effective screening tool, although cost-effectiveness has not been demonstrated and its effectiveness in reducing mortality from ovarian cancer has not been completely evaluated. Guidelines are presented for the use of ultrasonography in evaluating the postmenopausal ovary. 
Histiocytes in Sweet's syndrome. The histological features of biopsies from 18 previously unreported cases of Sweet's syndrome are reported. The dermal infiltrate in the majority of the cases contained numerous histiocytes that at first sight appeared to mimic neutrophils. The immunophenotype of these histiocytes was consistent with monocytes that have freshly infiltrated into the lesions. Only two of the cases in this series, associated with leukaemia, displayed the histological features of Sweet's syndrome with a predominant neutrophilic infiltration. We suggest that the initiating mechanisms in Sweet's syndrome are that monocyte/histiocyte-derived cytokines such as the interleukins IL-1 and IL-8, secreted either by infiltrating histiocytes in the non-leukaemia-associated cases of Sweet's syndrome or by tumoural myelomonocytic cells in those associated with leukaemia, are responsible for the systemic manifestations and the infiltration with neutrophils in the skin lesions. 
Elevated circulating interleukin-6 is associated with an acute-phase response but reduced fixed hepatic protein synthesis in patients with cancer. It has been suggested that, as part of the inflammatory response to the presence of a tumor, various cytokines are produced and these induce hepatic synthesis of acute-phase proteins (APP). Under these circumstances it is not known what changes occur in the fixed component of hepatic protein synthesis. The aim of this study was to compare circulating interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) concentrations and fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates in a group of healthy controls (n = 6) with a group of patients with an established APP response secondary to hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer (n = 6). Fixed hepatic protein synthesis rates were measured following a primed, constant 20-hour infusion of 15N-glycine. The liver was biopsied at laparotomy. The APP response was assessed by serum C-reactive protein concentration and cytokines were assayed by a combination of immunoassay and bioassay. The patients with advanced cancer and an on-going APP response had elevated circulating IL-6 concentrations (p less than 0.01). Rates of fixed hepatic protein synthesis were 30% lower than those observed in controls (p less than 0.01). These findings demonstrate that in patients with hepatic metastasis, although the synthesis of certain acute-phase export proteins can be increased, fixed protein synthesis is reduced. Whether these changes in the distribution of hepatic protein synthesis are mediated by IL-6 will require further investigation. 
Experience with a third-generation implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. A Medtronic 7216A pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillator was implanted in 16 patients (mean age 56 years) with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) and organic heart disease with a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 33%. Endocardial and epicardial defibrillation shock efficacy was evaluated before or at implant using 1 to 3 shock patterns, i.e., monophasic single, sequential or simultaneous shocks with dual and triple electrode configurations. Endocardial leads used a common right ventricular cathode and dual anodes, whereas epicardial leads used 2 or 3 helical coil patches. VT termination was evaluated using pacing or shock therapy, or both, whereas only shocks were used in VF. Programmable bradycardia pacing, individual zones for VT and VF detection and individualized pacing and shock therapy for VT and VF were used. Monophasic shocks had epicardial defibrillation thresholds ranging from 3 to 18 (mean 10) J and were comparable for sequential and simultaneous shocks (p greater than 0.2). VT detection rates ranged from 340 to 470 ms and VF detection rates from 270 to 330 ms. VT or VF induction, or both, was performed noninvasively in 13 patients after implant and was reproducibly terminated by rapid pacing alone (5 patients), low-energy shocks (2 patients), high-energy shocks (3 patients) and combined therapy (3 patients). Intermediate or high-energy shocks terminated all induced VF episodes. During follow-up (2 to 12 months), there have been 2 noncardiac deaths. Electrical therapy was delivered in 7 patients, for VT (3 patients), VT and VF (3 patients) and indeterminate tachyarrhythmia (1 patient). All VT/VF episodes were successfully terminated, with 78 of 96 (81%) spontaneous VT episodes terminated by pacing. Follow-up reprogramming was required in 5 patients. It is concluded that successful application of individualized electrical therapy prescriptions in patients with VT/VF is feasible. Pacing therapies, which are effective for induced VT, can be reliably used for effective long-term spontaneous VT termination in conjunction with shock therapy and can permit reduced patient exposure to shock therapy. Thus, a programmable hybrid pacemaker cardioverter-defibrillator system provides nonthoracotomy implantation, effective VT/VF termination, demand ventricular pacing and noninvasive modes for arrhythmia induction, event monitoring and clinical trouble-shooting. 
Laparoscopic treatment of painful perihepatic adhesions in Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome. This report illustrates a case of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in which the clinical symptom of right upper quadrant pain was severe and persistent despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Because of the atypical course, an extensive work-up was performed to rule out other possible etiologies for the pain. In this context, a laparoscopy was performed and identified dense adhesions between the liver and the anterior abdominal wall. These adhesions were safely and successfully lysed using a KTP/532 laser through a second puncture site. After surgery the pain was completely resolved, with no further recurrence after 6 months of follow-up. 
Severely injured geriatric patients return to independent living: a study of factors influencing function and independence. Our previous work demonstrated that geriatric trauma patients (age greater than 65 years) consume disproportionate amounts of health care resources. In the past we hypothesized that late mortality is high, long-term outcome is poor, and return to independence is low in a severely injured geriatric population. Of 6,480 trauma admissions over 5 years, geriatric patients (n = 495) with blunt trauma injury (n = 421) and an ISS greater than 16 (n = 105) who survived until discharge (n = 61) underwent long-term follow-up (mean = 2.82 years). We surveyed 20 measures of functional ability; 10 measures of independence; availability and use of rehabilitation resources; employment history; alcohol use; support systems; and nursing home requirements. Of the 105 patients, 7 were subsequently lost to follow-up. Among the remaining 98, 44 (44.9%) died in hospital and 54 (55.1%) were discharged and interviewed. The mean age of the contacted patients was 72.6; their mean ISS was 23.3. Forty eight of 54 (88.9%) were alive at the time of interview, while 6/54 (11.1%) had died. Although only 8/48 patients regained their preinjury level of function, 32/48 (67%) returned to independent living. The 32 independent patients, those with "acceptable" outcome, were compared with an "unacceptable" outcome group composed of the 44 in-hospital deaths, the 6 late deaths, and the 16 dependent patients. Factors associated with poor outcome include a GCS score less than or equal to (p = 0.001), age greater than or equal to 75 (p = 0.004), shock upon admission (p = 0.014), presence of head injury (p = 0.03), and sepsis (p = 0.03). 
Coronary bypass surgery improves global and regional left ventricular function following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. TAMI Study Group. Coronary bypass surgery was performed prior to hospital discharge in 303 (22%) of 1387 consecutive patients enrolled in the TAMI 1 to 3 and 5 trials of intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Bypass surgery was of emergency nature (less than 24 hours from treatment with intravenous thrombolytic therapy) in 36 (2.6%) and was deferred (greater than 24 hours) in 267 (19.3%) patients. The indications for bypass surgery included failed angioplasty (12%); left main or equivalent coronary disease (9%); complex or multivessel coronary disease (62%); recurrent postinfarction angina (13%); and refractory pump dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture or abnormal predischarge functional test (1% each). Although patients having bypass surgery were older (59.5 +/- 9.8 versus 56.0 +/- 10.2 years, (p less than 0.0001), had more extensive coronary artery disease (46% with three-vessel disease versus 11%, (p less than 0.0001), had more frequent diabetes mellitus (19% versus 15%, (p = 0.048), had more prior infarctions (p less than 0.0001), had more severe initial depression in global left ventricular ejection fraction (48.0 +/- 11.9% versus 51.8 +/- 11.9%, p = 0.0002), and regional infarct zone (-2.7 +/- 0.94 versus -2.5 +/- 1.1 SD/chord, p = 0.02) and noninfarct zone function (-0.36 +/- 1.8 versus 0.43 +/- 1.6 SD/chord, p less than 0.0001) than patients not having coronary bypass surgery, no difference in the incidence of death in hospital (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) or death at long-term follow-up of hospital survivors (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) was noted between groups. Surgical patients demonstrated a greater degree of recovery in left ventricular ejection fraction (3.4 +/- 9.8% versus 0.16 +/- 8.5%, p = 0.036) and infarct zone regional function (0.71 +/- 1.1 versus 0.34 +/- 0.99 SD/chord, p = 0.001) when immediate (90 minutes following initiation of thrombolytic therapy) and predischarge (7 to 14 days after treatment) contrast left ventriculograms were compared than did patients who received only intravenous thrombolytic therapy with or without coronary angioplasty. These data suggest a beneficial influence of coronary bypass surgery on left ventricular function and possibly on the clinical outcome of patients initially treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. 
Mechanism of inhibitory action of prostaglandins on the growth of human gastric carcinoma cell line KATO III. Prostaglandins (PGs) play important roles in the regulation of various gastric functions. In this study, the effects of various PGs on the growth of the human gastric carcinoma cell line KATO III were investigated. All the PGs tested inhibited KATO III cell growth with a relative potency order of PGE2 greater than PGE1 greater than 17S,20-dimethyl-6-oxo PGE1-methyl ester (ornoprostil) greater than PGF2 alpha. This inhibition was accompanied by an increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate production. Furthermore, in the presence of guanosine triphosphate, these PGs stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in the plasma membrane of KATO III cells, followed by enhancement of membrane guanosine triphosphatase activity. The relative potencies of these PGs for increasing cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, activating adenylate cyclase, and enhancing guanosine triphosphatase activity were all comparable to those for inhibiting cell growth. On the other hand, the proliferation of KATO III cells was also inhibited by forskolin as well as dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate, whereas none of the agents that did not increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels had any effect. These results suggest that PGs inhibit KATO III cell growth by stimulating cyclic adenosine monophosphate production via a guanosine triphosphate-dependent process, suggesting the involvement of guanosine triphosphate-binding stimulatory protein, probably coupled to PGE2 receptors, in the action of PGs. 
Successful percutaneous closure of a complex coronary-to-pulmonary artery fistula using a detachable balloon: benefits of intra-procedural physiologic and angiographic assessment. A 48-yr-old woman presented with a loud continuous precordial murmur and symptoms of fatigue. Color-flow doppler imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging failed to show the cause of the murmur. Diagnostic catheterization showed a large left anterior descending coronary artery to pulmonary artery fistula with impaired left ventricular wall motion. Two detachable balloons were deployed in the fistula with complete abolition of flow in the main fistula channel. A small parallel channel of the fistula, previously not appreciated due to vessel overlap, remained patent but had trivial flow as assessed by green-dye and oximetric techniques. The patient had immediate resolution of her symptoms and return of normal ventricular wall motion. 
Bilateral gluteus maximus transposition for anal incontinence. Seven patients (five men and two women) ranging in age from 26 to 65 years (means = 44) underwent bilateral gluteus maximus transposition for complete anal incontinence. The indications for operation were sphincter destruction secondary to multiple fistulotomies (n = 4), bilateral pudendal nerve damage (n = 2), and high imperforate anus (n = 1). The procedure is performed without the use of a diverting colostomy. The inferior portion of the origin of each gluteus maximus is detached from the sacrum and coccyx, bifurcated, and tunneled subcutaneously to encircle the anus. The ends are then sutured together to form two opposing slings of voluntary muscle. Postoperatively, six patients regained continence to solid stool, two to liquid stool as well, and only one patient in this group was able to control flatus. Although resting pressures remained unchanged, voluntary squeeze pressures were restored by this operation. In addition, rectal sensation was markedly improved, which helps make this a worthwhile procedure for properly selected patients. 
Effects of hemoperfusion during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on left ventricular function. The effect of autologous blood perfusion, delivered through an angiographic power injector, on alleviating left ventricular (LV) hemodynamic deterioration during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was examined. LV systolic and diastolic pressures, LV peak positive and peak negative first derivative of LV pressure (dP/dt), and ST-segment shift were recorded in 9 patients with and without hemoperfusion. Hemoperfusion resulted in an improved LV hemodynamic profile during balloon occlusion, as reflected in LV systolic pressure (127 +/- 14 vs 120 +/- 15 mm Hg, p = 0.01), LV end-diastolic pressure (17 +/- 14 vs 25 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), peak positive (1,237 +/- 240 vs 1,149 +/- 225 mm Hg/s, p less than 0.05) and peak negative (1,666 +/- 357 vs 1,485 +/- 385 mm Hg/s, p = 0.003) dP/dt. Hemoperfusion provides substantial protection for significant LV dysfunction induced by conventional PTCA in 1-vessel angioplasty and is a feasible option to protect against potential cardiovascular collapse in high-risk PTCA. 
Cisplatin and fluorouracil chemotherapy does not yield long-term benefit in locally advanced head and neck cancer: results from a single institution. Fifty-one patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer were treated with three cycles of cisplatin at 100 mg/m2 followed by 5-day continuous infusion fluorouracil (5-FU) at 1,000 mg/m2/d as induction chemotherapy. Subsequent local therapy consisted of surgery for patients with resectable disease and/or radiotherapy. Three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy were administered to patients with partial response (PR) or complete response (CR) to induction chemotherapy. Twenty-two patients (43%) had a clinical CR that was pathologically confirmed in 12 patients (24%), and 24 patients (47%) had a PR for an overall response rate of 90%. Local therapy included surgery in 24 patients (47%) and radiotherapy alone in 22 patients (43%). Adjuvant chemotherapy was administered to 32 patients (63%) frequently at great dose reduction. At a median follow-up of 90 months, the median survival is 22 months (95% confidence interval, 15 to 36 months), and the 5-year survival is 25%, with only five patients known to be alive and disease-free at this time. The median time to progression is 14 months, with 29 patients (57%) having documented progression of their head and neck cancer and eight (16%) having progression of a second neoplasm. Seven patients died of intervening medical events. This high incidence of second malignancies supports the continued investigation of chemoprevention for patients in CR. Despite the known high response rates achieved with cisplatin and 5-FU induction chemotherapy, the overall poor survival data reported here should lead to a thorough reexamination of the frequent administration of this regimen in the community. 
Periorbital necrobiotic xanthogranuloma and stage I multiple myeloma. Ultrastructure and response to pulsed dexamethasone documented by magnetic resonance imaging. We observed a 40-year-old woman with necrobiotic xanthogranuloma from the inception of indurated eyelid and periorbital infiltrates and concurrent stage I multiple myeloma to resolution of infiltrates in skin and bone marrow after pulsed high-dose oral dexamethasone therapy. Ultrastructural studies revealed lipid vacuoles in epidermal keratinocytes, in dermal histiocytic macrophages, and in vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells. The presence of lipid vacuoles in epidermal keratinocytes has not been reported previously in xanthogranuloma. 
Basal and maximum acid output after continuous overnight gastric aspiration. Basal and maximum acid outputs were measured on two occasions in a group of 15 duodenal ulcer (DU) patients in remission. The initial study was carried out after a nocturnal acid collection, whereas the second was carried out in the conventional manner without preceding nocturnal aspiration. No difference in the basal acid output, concentration, or volume of secretion was found between the two study days. Maximum acid output on the other hand, was significantly (p less than 0.02) reduced from 30.9 (14.2-41.2) mmol/h, median (+range), to 23.7 (8.1-33.7) mmol/h after overnight aspiration. The reduction in maximum acid output was attributable to a fall in the volume of gastric secretion from 280 (170-371) ml to 230 (142-280) ml. No fall in acid concentration was seen. We conclude that overnight gastric aspiration does not affect basal gastric secretion, but reduces the maximum acid output as a result of a reduced secretory volume. 
Helicobacter pylori infection and the risk of gastric carcinoma BACKGROUND. Infection with Helicobacter pylori has been linked with chronic atrophic gastritis, an inflammatory precursor of gastric adenocarcinoma. In a nested case-control study, we explored whether H. pylori infection increases the risk of gastric carcinoma. METHODS. From a cohort of 128,992 persons followed since the mid-1960s at a health maintenance organization, 186 patients with gastric carcinoma were selected as case patients and were matched according to age, sex, and race with 186 control subjects without gastric carcinoma. Stored serum samples collected during the 1960s were tested for IgG antibodies to H. pylori by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data on cigarette use, blood group, ulcer disease, and gastric surgery were obtained from questionnaires administered at enrollment. Tissue sections and pathology reports were reviewed to confirm the histologic results. RESULTS. The mean time between serum collection and the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma was 14.2 years. Of the 109 patients with confirmed gastric adenocarcinoma (excluding tumors of the gastroesophageal junction), 84 percent had been infected previously with H. pylori, as compared with 61 percent of the matched control subjects (odds ratio, 3.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.8 to 7.3). Tumors of the gastroesophageal junction were not linked to H. pylori infection, nor were tumors in the gastric cardia. H. pylori was a particularly strong risk factor for stomach cancer in women (odds ratio, 18) and blacks (odds ratio, 9). A history of gastric surgery was independently associated with the development of cancer (odds ratio, 17; P = 0.03), but a history of peptic ulcer disease was negatively associated with subsequent gastric carcinoma (odds ratio, 0.2; P = 0.02). Neither blood group nor smoking history affected risk. CONCLUSIONS. Infection with H. pylori is associated with an increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma and may be a cofactor in the pathogenesis of this malignant condition. 
The noncemented porous-coated hip prosthesis. A three-year clinical follow-up study and roentgenographic analysis. This was a retrospective study reviewing 68 hip arthroplasties performed with noncemented, porous-coated components at three institutions in the period between December 1983 and June 1987. Fifty of these were available for follow-up study. The mean follow-up period was three years (range, 18-56 months). Thirty-seven patients were treated by total hip arthroplasty (THA) with porous-coated components, and thirteen were implanted with porous-coated femoral stems with bipolar endoprostheses using a porous-coated femoral stem and a universal head. The mean Harris hip score at follow-up evaluation for the entire group was 85.7 points. Eighty percent of the patients had either a good or excellent result. Those patients implanted with a porous femoral stem with bipolar acetabular components had only 54% good or excellent results compared with 90% good or excellent results for those having THA. Roentgenographic findings included a 59% rate of femoral neck cortex osteopenia, an 80% rate of medial or lateral distal cortical hypertrophy, and an 80% rate of distal bone bridging. All of these roentgenographic changes were secondary to changes in stress transference to the proximal femur. There was no correlation between thigh pain or the degree of bone-prosthesis radiolucencies and the fit of the femoral stem. 
Rupture of low transverse cesarean scars during trial of labor We report eight cases of rupture of low transverse cesarean scars occurring during trials of labor. The cases occurred in five hospitals in the Denver metropolitan area during a 13-month period. The estimated incidence was 0.7% of planned trials of labor. Complications of rupture included one neonatal death, two cases of severe neonatal asphyxia, three maternal bladder lacerations, and one hysterectomy. 
The influence of diazepam or lorazepam on the frequency of endotracheal intubation in childhood status epilepticus. Anticonvulsant management of status epilepticus (SE) may result in respiratory depression, often requiring endotracheal intubation (ETI). By examining rates of ETI in childhood SE after intravenous diazepam or lorazepam, when administered alone or in combination with phenytoin, the influence of anticonvulsants on the frequency of ETI during SE was determined. The medical records of 142 consecutive children younger than 16 years of age admitted from a university hospital ED with seizures during a 28-month period were retrospectively reviewed. SE was identified in 38 (27%) of cases. Records of children with SE were reviewed for demographic, seizure severity, and management variables. Twelve patients were excluded, ten of whom received concomitant phenobarbital. Patients receiving lorazepam had ETI rate of 27% (4/15), compared to 73% (8/11) in the diazepam group (P = 0.026, Fisher's exact). The groups were not significantly different in age, weight, sex, seizure type, seizure duration, and appropriate anticonvulsant dosage. A prospective, randomized trial comparing lorazepam and diazepam is warranted to confirm the apparent advantage of lorazepam in reducing respiratory depression. 
Opercular cheiro-oral syndrome. Perioral and distal upper limb sensory dysfunction (cheiro-oral syndrome) has classically been attributed to cortical involvement. In previously reported cases of the syndrome, caused by stroke, however, the thalamus or brain stem has been the actual site of the lesion. We have studied two patients with infarct in the superficial middle cerebral artery territory involving the parietal operculum. Sensory involvement was purely subjective in the face, but severe hypoesthesia was present in the distal upper limb, involving mainly position sense, stereognosis, and graphesthesia. Temperature and pain sensation were involved in one patient. These findings correlated with involvement of the lower part of the postcentral gyrus, more caudal parts of the parietal operculum, and underlying white matter. This opercular cheiro-oral syndrome seems more uncommon than faciobrachiocrural hemihypesthesia associated with anterior parietal artery territory infarct. A double supply to the parietal opercular region through branches of the temporal arteries and anterior parietal artery may explain the rarity of cheiro-oral syndrome resulting from hemisphere stroke, because simultaneous and partial compromise to two different pial artery networks is uncommon. 
Prevalence of simple adnexal cysts in postmenopausal women. This prospective study was performed with ultrasound (US) to determine the prevalence of unilocular, nonseptated adnexal cysts ("simple cysts") in healthy postmenopausal women and the relationship between cyst occurrence and both hormone replacement and length of time since onset of menopause. Transabdominal and transvaginal US were performed on 149 volunteers aged 50 years or older. Patients were classified according to hormone regimens (no hormones, unopposed estrogen, continuous daily estrogen and progesterone, and sequential estrogen and progesterone) and time since onset of menopause (less than 5 years, 5-10 years, and greater than 10 years). Simple adnexal cysts were found in 22 women with the aid of transvaginal and/or transabdominal US, yielding a relative frequency of 14.8% +/- 5.7% and a prevalence of 14,800 patients with cysts per 100,000 patients. No statistical relationship was found between cyst frequency and type of hormone replacement or length of time since onset of menopause. 
Rare presentation of a parapharyngeal schwannoma. Schwannoma, or neurilemmoma, is included in the differential diagnosis of masses in the parapharyngeal space. Schwannomata do not usually cause acute inflammation, and therefore do not tend to present as emergencies as in this case, in which there was acute respiratory embarrassment. 
Ventricular fibrillation complicating endomyocardial biopsy of a cardiac allograft. Transvenous endomyocardial biopsy remains the most useful diagnostic aid in assessing rejection in the transplanted heart. Although invasive, the complications associated with endomyocardial biopsy are few, and the procedure is generally regarded as safe. We report a case of apparent ventricular fibrillation complicating transvenous endomyocardial biopsy. Histologic section revealed evidence of moderate acute rejection. This case represents the first report of a life threatening ventricular dysrhythmia following routine endomyocardial biopsy in a cardiac transplant recipient. 
Fetal choroid plexus cysts in the second trimester of pregnancy: a cause for concern. Controversy surrounds the issue of recommending cytogenetic studies in second-trimester fetuses with fetal choroid plexus cysts. To assist in clarifying this issue, a prospective study was designed to describe the association between fetal choroid plexus cysts and aneuploidy in a large population. During a 3-year period 7350 women at 15 to 22 weeks' gestation underwent an ultrasonographic evaluation. Fetal choroid plexus cysts were diagnosed in 71 (0.96%) of these pregnancies. Sixty-two of the 71 patients elected to undergo amniocentesis. An abnormal karyotype was identified in four (6.4%) of these fetuses. One fetus had trisomy 21, and three fetuses were diagnosed with trisomy 18. These data indicate that it is reasonable to offer genetic counseling and cytogenetic studies in those patients identified as having a fetal choroid plexus cyst. 
Head-up tilt for the evaluation of syncope of unknown origin in children. Fifteen patients aged 10 to 18 years with syncope of unknown origin, and 10 healthy control children aged 11 to 18 years, were evaluated by head-up tilt to 60 degrees for 60 minutes. Six patients (43%) reproduced symptoms of syncope during the examination. Four had a typical vasovagal reaction; two had marked hyperventilation. None of the children in the control group had syncope. The head-up tilt test offers a simple, noninvasive, high-yielding diagnostic tool for evaluation of syncope in children. 
Endoscopic therapy for gastric cancer in patients more than 80 years old. We prospectively studied 17 gastric cancer patients who were more than 80 yr old, in whom endoscopic therapy was performed. The patients were divided into two groups: the first group included 13 patients in whom curative treatment was attempted, and in 11 (85%) a curative response was achieved. Two patients in this group showed a positive gastric biopsy after 1 and 2 yr, respectively, of therapy: one patient is under current treatment with laser therapy, and the other patient underwent surgery with resection of the stomach. The second group included four patients in whom treatment was aimed at prolonging survival or palliation, and in all four patients, a successful response was obtained. Therefore, our results demonstrate that endoscopic therapy is effective for the treatment of gastric cancer patients over 80 yr old. 
Expression and amplification of the HER-2/neu (c-erbB-2) protooncogene in epithelial ovarian tumors and cell lines. Amplification of the c-erbB-2 protooncogene has been associated with a poor prognosis in human breast and ovarian cancers. Our study was undertaken to examine whether amplification, rearrangement, or overexpression of c-erbB-2 and other protooncogenes was frequently observed in epithelial ovarian cancers. c-erbB-2 was expressed in 87% of 22 ovarian cancers analyzed, but expression was significantly increased in only one of the 22 tumor specimens. In this case elevated c-erbB-2 expression was associated with dramatic amplification of the gene. In another tumor a 3.8 kb EcoRI fragment was found, in addition to the usual 4.4 and 6.0 kb fragments; this is consistent with a possible gene rearrangement or a restriction fragment length polymorphism. To place these results in perspective, expression of several other protooncogenes has been examined in ovarian carcinomas. The c-fos, c-myc, n-myc, c-fms, and c-Ha-ras protooncogenes were expressed in different fractions of tumors, but expression of l-myc, c-erbB, c-myb, c-sis, and c-mos was not detectable. Aside from c-erbB-2, neither amplification nor rearrangement was observed among the other protooncogenes studied. Expression of c-erbB-2, c-fms, c-myc, n-myc, c-fos, and c-Ha-ras deserves further evaluation as a prognostic factor in ovarian cancer. 
Serum pepsinogen I concentrations in peptic ulcer patients in relation to ulcer location and stage. To investigate the relation of the serum group I pepsinogen (PG I) concentration to the location of gastric ulcers and chronicity of peptic ulcers, ulcer patients (n = 322) were compared with endoscopically normal subjects (n = 174). The mean PG I concentration was significantly higher in male control subjects (n = 90) than in female control subjects (n = 84). In male patients with ulcers in the duodenum (n = 69), antrum (n = 34), or angulus portion (the lower third of the body; n = 83), the mean serum PG I concentration was significantly higher than in the control subjects but in patients with an ulcer in the upper body (n = 49) it was similar to control values. Men with active or healing ulcers (n = 149) showed a significantly higher serum PG I concentration than those with scarred lesions (n = 86) when the abnormality was located in either the upper body or in the angulus portion. For female patients (n = 87), the results were similar. These results suggest that serum PG I concentrations reflect the stages of activity of peptic ulcer. 
Abnormal perception of visceral pain in response to gastric distension in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia. The irritable stomach syndrome. Sensory and pressure responses to gastric distension were evaluated in 24 consecutive patients suffering from chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and 20 healthy subjects. A latex balloon was placed in the proximal stomach and inflated by increments of 100 ml of air up to a maximal volume of 800 ml. Symptom response and intragastric pressure-volume curve were recorded during the gradual balloon distension. Thirteen of the 24 patients experienced pain at a distension volume less than or equal to 400 ml of air, but only one of the 20 controls (P less than 0.001). Intragastric pressure-volume curves were similar in patients and controls, and in patients with and without abnormal pain threshold, suggesting that a compliance defect was not the cause of the sensory anomaly. Gastric emptying of solids and liquids was measured in 20 of the 24 patients using a dual isotopic technique; psychological status was also evaluated in 18 patients using the Mini-Mult test. The frequency of the sensory anomaly was not different in patients with (7/14) or without (4/6) gastric stasis, but was lower in patients with (5/13) than in those without psychological disturbances (5/5, P less than 0.01). Thus, a primary visceral sensory anomaly, either alone or in conjunction with motility disturbances, can play an important role in chronic idiopathic dyspepsia and must be taken in account for further therapeutic research. 
Association of nm23-H1 allelic deletions with distant metastases in colorectal carcinoma. A prospective study analysed the prognostic value of nm23-H1 allelic deletions in colorectal cancer. Of 21 patients with no evidence of distant metastases at initial operation, 11 showed nm23-H1 allelic deletions (including 1 homozygous deletion); 10 had no nm23-H1 deletions. After median follow-up of 25 months, distant metastases had developed in 8 of 11 (73%) patients with nm23-H1 deletions but in only 2 of 10 (20%) without nm23-H1 deletions (p less than 0.03). Tests with probe YNZ 22.1, near p53, showed no significant association with distant metastases. nm23-H1 may be, or may be located near, a late-acting suppressor gene in colorectal carcinoma, in which deletions may have prognostic value. 
Blood and liver-infiltrating lymphocytes in primary biliary cirrhosis: increase in activated T and natural killer cells and recruitment of primed memory T cells. We used two-color and three-color flow cytometric analysis to study phenotypical activation and functional subsets of T and natural killer cells in the blood and liver tissue of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, other chronic liver diseases and the blood of healthy subjects. The changes in blood lymphocyte phenotype in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases were similar and comprised elevated relative or absolute numbers of activated human leukocyte antigen-DR + T subset (CD4+ and CD8+) cells and DR+ natural killer-like (CD16+) cells. B cell (CD19+) numbers were normal. In primary biliary cirrhosis a selective reduction in T cells of suppressor-inducer (CD45RA + CD4 + ) type was registered. The human leukocyte antigen-DR expression among CD4+ T cell subsets was investigated further in primary biliary cirrhosis and healthy controls using triple antibody flow cytometric analysis. Phenotypical cell activation was confined to helper T cells of the primed, memory (CD45RO + CD4+) type. The decrease in suppressor-inducer T cells in primary biliary cirrhosis was paralleled by a reciprocal increase in primed memory T cells. Several significant differences were observed when blood and liver-infiltrating cells from primary biliary cirrhosis patients were compared. In the liver tissue, the CD4/CD8 ratio was decreased, the relative activation of T-subset cells and NK cells was further increased, the suppressor-inducer T subset was further depressed and the primed memory T subset was increased. The cytotoxic T-cell subset (CD11b-) dominated within the CD8+ population. In liver tissue from other chronic liver disease subjects, a lower CD4/CD8 ratio was found compared with primary biliary cirrhosis. 
Familial amyloid polyneuropathy: alanine-for-threonine substitution in the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule. A previously reported family with amyloid polyneuropathy (FAP) was reinvestigated to determine the type of mutation in the transthyretin (prealbumin) molecule. Transthyretin was isolated from amyloid-laden myocardium and serum, and tryptic peptides were resolved by high-performance liquid chromatography. Amino acid sequencing of an anomalous peptide revealed an alanine-for-threonine substitution corresponding to position No. 60 of the transthyretin monomer. Detection of the FAP gene in asymptomatic carriers was accomplished by hybrid isoelectric focusing of transthyretin in the presence of dithiothreitol and high concentrations of urea, and by Southern blotting of Pvull-digested leukocyte deoxyribonucleic acid. This type of FAP was found to be identical to the previously described Appalachian amyloid. Patients with FAP and their asymptomatic gene-carrying offspring had significantly reduced levels of serum transthyretin and retinol-binding protein. 
MRI of the facial nerve during paralysis. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI was used to evaluate 10 patients with Bell's palsy and one patient with facial paralysis secondary to Lyme disease. Nine of the eleven patients showed increased signal intensity of their facial nerve with gadolinium-enhanced MRI. In all nine patients, the facial nerve was involved at the labyrinthine, geniculate ganglion and proximal tympanic portions of the facial nerve, while two of the nine patients also had involvement of the mastoid segment of the facial nerve. Patients whose facial nerve enhancement was limited to the labyrinthine, geniculate ganglion and proximal tympanic facial nerve ultimately had complete return of facial function. Patients whose facial nerve enhanced in the mastoid segment experienced incomplete return of facial function. Gadolinium is effective in localizing the site of inflammation during facial paralysis. Those patients with enhancement localized to the labyrinthine, geniculate ganglion and proximal tympanic segments were more likely to regain complete facial function. In contrast, patients who had enhancement of the mastoid segment of the facial nerve had poorer prognoses for complete return of facial function. 
Necrotizing fasciitis: 10 years' experience in a district general hospital. Of 14 patients with necrotizing fasciitis who presented between 1979 and 1988, six (43 per cent) died. The deaths were associated with delays in diagnosis, poor surgical technique and diabetes. Prompt diagnosis, resuscitation and early radical surgery are essential to the successful management of necrotizing fasciitis. 
Primary intracerebral osteosarcoma. A 64-year-old man was admitted because of a rapidly progressive left side hemiparesis. A computed tomography scan showed a right side intrathalamic mass, partially calcified. Surgical specimen proved to be an osteosarcoma. The patient died 3 days later from an acute myocardial infarct. Autopsy failed to discover any other significant lesion. A review of the literature disclosed that this case might be the second published primary intracerebral osteosarcoma and the first with immunocytochemical analysis. 
Morphological changes of hepatic microcirculation in experimental rat cirrhosis: a scanning electron microscopic study. Morphological changes of hepatic microcirculation, especially peribiliary plexus, in experimental rat cirrhosis that resulted from the repeated intraperitoneal injections of N-diethylnitrosamine, 100 mg/kg body weight/one shot/week, were examined by scanning electron microscope. Control rats were treated with saline. Whole blood vessels of the rats were perfused by saline and stuffed with methylmethacrylated resin. Multiple nodular changes were seen in the livers after the five injections (5 wk) of N-diethylnitrosamine, and diffuse nodular transformations mimicking human cirrhosis after six injections (6 wk) were also seen. Overall changes in experimental rats were numerous vascular channels mainly composed of venous branches around the parenchymal nodules, increased arterioportal anastomoses and flattening of veins, especially hepatic vein branches. Peribiliary plexuses of the experimental rats were much richer in the vessels than those of the controls, and many dilated veins, ramified from portal vein branches, were present in the former. Direct connections between peribiliary plexuses and sinusoids or between peribiliary plexuses and portal veins increased in the experimental rats. Studies concerning microcirculatory changes of peribiliary plexuses in experimental rat cirrhosis are rare. It was concluded that the abnormal peribiliary plexuses in this experimental series might participate in a collateral circulation under a state of portal hypertension. 
Prognostic value of lymphocyte surface markers in acute myeloid leukemia. We studied the expression of cell surface antigens associated with myeloid and lymphoid leukemias on bone marrow-derived blast cells from 339 patients with newly diagnosed de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) enrolled on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) chemotherapy protocols. Surprisingly, of 211 cases studied for the expression of CD2 (T-cell marker, sheep erythrocyte binding receptor for T lymphocytes) 45 were positive (21%). In addition, of 298 patients studied for CD19 (B-lymphocyte marker), 41 were positive (14%). Overall, of 170 patients studied for both CD2 and CD19, 56 (33%) were positive. Interestingly, central review of the French-American-British (FAB) morphology of the CD2- and CD19-positive cases showed that FAB M3 was twice as frequent, and M4E eight times as frequent compared with the CD2- and CD19-negative cases. Of 22 lymphocyte antigen-positive cases in which cells were available for studies of Ig or T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement, 20 were germline, one had a rearranged Ig heavy chain gene, and one had rearranged TCR beta and Ig heavy chain genes. The presence of messenger RNA for CD2 was demonstrated in four CD2 surface antigen-positive cases, thus validating the cell surface data. Lymphocyte antigen-positive cases had karyotypes commonly seen in AML; 71% of cases with an abnormal clone had t(8;21)(q22;q22), inversion 16(p13q22), t(15;17)(q22;q12), or t(9;11)(p22;q23). The patients with lymphocyte markers had a significantly higher incidence of these karyotypic abnormalities compared with patients with lymphocyte antigen-negative AML (34% v 15%, P less than .02). When the outcome to therapy of the lymphocyte antigen-positive cases was compared with that for the CD2, CD19-negative cases, we found that the CD2, CD19-positive cases actually had higher complete remission rates (75% v 59%, P = .04), and significantly longer time to failure (P = .02; 32.4% +/- 6.0% v 18.0% +/- 4.1% at 2 years) and overall survival (P = .02; 43.5% +/- 6.3% v 26.0% +/- 4.5% at 2 years). CD2 antigen-positive cases also had a significantly superior survival (P = .02; 43.8% +/- 7.9% v 29.8% +/- 3.8% at 2 years). There were no significant differences (P less than or equal to .05) between the two groups in age, leukocyte count at diagnosis, incidence of extramedullary disease, or FAB classification.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Bleeding peptic ulcer after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery. A retrospective study of 112 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 232 with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) demonstrated that 16.7% of those with AAA and 1.6% of those with ASO had a history of gastroduodenal ulcer; 83% of these lesions with AAA were gastric ulcers. Ulcer bleeding after vascular reconstruction developed in seven patients with AAA and one with ASO. Serum fibrinogen levels and platelet counts were significantly lower in patients with AAA than in those with ASO or controls. A prospective study showed that 25 (52.1%) of 48 patients with AAA and six (20.0%) of 30 patients with ASO had endoscopically proved gastroduodenal lesions before vascular reconstruction. None of them developed postoperative bleeding after treatment of both their gastroduodenal lesions and coagulopathy. Furthermore, the significant decrease in blood flow and prostaglandin content of gastric mucosa was demonstrated in patients with AAA. 
Severity of obstructive sleep apnea. A four-level severity scale for obstructive sleep apnea is offered using four criteria: maximum oxygen desaturation, apnea/hyponea index, symptoms of excessive day-time sleepiness, and symptoms of related cardiac disease. Oxygen desaturation and the apnea/hyponea index for 175 patients, all having had uvulopalatopharyngoplasty surgery, showed 19% mild, 33% moderate, 17% moderately severe, and 31% severe obstructive sleep apnea. There was a very poor correlation between oxygen desaturations and number of obstructive events, which demands that both be used in any estimation of disease severity. 
Bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism demonstrated in a patient with cerebellar astrocytoma. A case of calcification in the striopallidodentate system associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism, clinically manifested after operation for a cystic astrocytoma of the cerebellar vermis, is reported. Bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification accompanying a disturbance in calcium metabolism is rare. Only a few cases have been described previously in the literature, of which only six were accompanied by pseudohypoparathyroidism. The importance of identifying hypoparathyroidism, especially pseudohypoparathyroidism, early in the course of investigation is discussed. 
Washed human platelets prevent ischemia-reperfusion edema in isolated rabbit lungs. Washed human platelets prevent edema formation in isolated rabbit lungs infused with xanthine oxidase, an enzyme that injures endothelial membranes by generating extracellular oxidants. We hypothesized that platelets would similarly preserve membrane permeability in isolated lungs exposed to ischemia-reperfusion injury, a model that perturbs endothelial cells by the generation of intracellular oxidants. Isolated perfused rabbit lungs (IPL) were exposed to warm ischemia-reperfusion to cause lung edema. The infusion of washed human platelets (1.05 +/- 0.02 x 10(10) cells) prevented edema formation as measured by lung weight gain, wet-to-dry lung weight ratios, histological edema, and preservation of paraendothelial cell tight junctions. Inhibition of the platelet glutathione redox cycle with 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, dehydroepiandrosterone, or 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene interfered with platelet protective effects. In contrast, inhibition of platelet catalase with aminotriazole and H2O2 had no effect on platelet protection. Lung tissue malonyldialdehyde concentrations were similar in isolated lungs exposed to ischemia-reperfusion with or without the infusion of platelets. These results indicate that platelet attenuation of ischemia-reperfusion lung edema depends on platelet glutathione redox cycle antioxidants but not platelet catalase. 
Hypermetabolism in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita. Two patients who developed hypermetabolic reactions during anaesthesia and surgery and who were suffering from arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are reported and it is proposed that the reaction is distinct from malignant hyperthermia and independent of the anaesthetic agents used. The implications for anaesthetists involved in the management of patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are discussed. 
Nonaspiration fine-needle cytology of the liver: a new technique for obtaining diagnostic samples. We studied a new method of obtaining diagnostic cytology samples from the liver that differs from fine-needle aspiration cytology in that no suction is used to obtain the sample. This method is simpler to perform than traditional aspiration biopsy and yields concentrated cell smears that are easier to interpret. The sample enters the needle because of capillary action, a physical property of fluid that causes it to flow into the lumen of a narrow channel. This nonaspiration technique was used in 40 consecutive patients undergoing fine-needle biopsy of mass lesions of the liver. A 22-gauge spinal needle was used in all procedures. The cytology smears obtained were prepared, stained, and interpreted by the same methods used for conventional fine-needle cytology specimens. Specific diagnoses were rendered in 36 patients (90%) and in 32 (94%) of those patients with malignant tumors. An average of 1.7 needle passes (range, 1-4) was needed per patient. We conclude that the results from nonaspiration fine-needle cytology of the liver are as good as those from conventional aspiration technique, and the nonaspiration technique is easier to perform and results in smears that are easier to interpret. 
Public Health Service inter-agency guidelines for screening donors of blood, plasma, organs, tissues, and semen for evidence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Several infectious agents transmit through infected blood and blood products. To decrease the potential for disease transmission, donors are screened for risk factors by medical history and for evidence of infection by specific testing. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently requires that all donations of whole blood and transfusable components as well as plasma for fractionation into injectable derivatives be subjected to a serologic test for syphilis, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (anti-HIV). The FDA also currently recommends testing donations of whole blood and components for transfusion for antibody to human T lymphotropic virus type I (anti-HTLV-I) and antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), and is considering recommending testing for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Blood banks in the United States voluntarily began testing donations for anti-HBc and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 1986 and 1987 and for anti-HCV in 1990. 
Pharmacokinetics, neuromuscular effects, and biodisposition of 3-desacetylvecuronium (Org 7268) in cats. The pharmacokinetics, biodisposition, and neuromuscular blocking properties of 3-desacetylvecuronium were studied in 17 adult cats. Animals were divided into three groups: five cats with kidney failure induced by bilateral ligation of the renal pedicles, six cats with galactosamine-induced fulminant hepatitis, and six control cats. An intravenous bolus of 300 micrograms.kg-1 of 3-desacetylvecuronium was rapidly injected into the jugular vein. Arterial blood, urine, and bile samples were collected at regular intervals for 6 h in control cats and for 8 h in cats with kidney or liver failure. The liver was excised for analysis at the end of the experiment. In cats with renal failure, 3-desacetylvecuronium pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variables did not differ from those in control cats. In cats with liver failure, plasma clearance was significantly less and mean residence time greater than in control cats (2.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 14.1 +/- 6.5 ml.kg-1.min-1 and 334 +/- 225 vs. 49 +/- 29 min, mean +/- SD, respectively). Volume of distribution at steady state in cats with liver failure and in control cats was not different. Also, in cats with liver failure, the duration of action and recovery index of 3-desacetylvecuronium was significantly greater than in control cats (168 +/- 62 vs. 82 +/- 32 min, and 39 +/- 19 vs. 10 +/- 4 min, respectively). Onset time of neuromuscular blockade was similar in all three groups. Total recovery of 3-desacetylvecuronium, for all three groups, in urine, bile, and liver was 90 +/- 11% (mean +/- SD). In control cats, 70 +/- 18% of 3-desacetylvecuronium was recovered in bile and liver and 19 +/- 14% in urine. No 3,17-bidesacetylvecuronium (a putative 3-desacetylvecuronium metabolite) was detected. 
Increased thrombin levels during thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. Relevance for the success of therapy. BACKGROUND. It has been suggested that thrombolysis in a feedback reaction may generate pro-coagulant activities. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fifty-five patients were treated with urokinase-preactivated prourokinase (n = 35) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (n = 20) for acute myocardial infarction and underwent coronary angiography at 90 minutes and at 24-36 hours into thrombolysis, and fibrinogen (Ratnoff-Menzie), D-dimer (ELISA) and thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels (ELISA) were measured. Primary patency was achieved in 39 patients (70.9%), 13 of whom (33.3%) suffered early reocclusion. Nonsignificant decreases in fibrinogen levels were observed while D-dimer levels increased +3,008 +/- 4,047 micrograms/l (p less than 0.01), differences not being significant in respect to the thrombolytic agents or to the clinical course. In contrast, while thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels decreased -4.4 +/- 13.0 micrograms/l in patients with persistent patency, they increased +7.5 +/- 13.6 micrograms/l in case of nonsuccessful thrombolysis (p less than 0.02) and +11.9 +/- 23.8 micrograms/l in case of early reocclusion (p less than 0.001). For patients with thrombin-antithrombin III complex levels greater than 6 ng/l 120 minutes into thrombolysis, the unfavorable clinical course was predicted with 96.2% sensitivity and 93.1% specificity. CONCLUSION. Generation of thrombin, occurring during thrombolysis, is a major determinant for the success of therapy and thrombin-antithrombin III levels may serve as predictors for the short-term prognosis. 
Vulnerability of nerve fibres to ischaemia. A quantitative light and electron microscope study. In order to learn more about the vulnerability of nerve fibres to ischemia, a quantitative study of nerve fibre abnormalities was performed on biopsy specimens of the superficial branch of the peroneal nerve from 26 patients with vasculitic neuropathy: 20 had necrotizing arteritis, 5 a lymphocytic, and 1 a leucocytoclastic vasculitis on nerve and/or muscle biopsy. The density of myelinated fibres ranged from 25 to 7880 per mm2 (n = 8470 +/- 706 (SD]. There was a marked inequality in the density of nerve fibres between the fascicles of individual nerves with a mean coefficient of variation of 41 +/- 37 (SD) % versus 7.4 +/- 3.0% in controls. Loss of myelinated fibres, which was greater for fibres larger than 7 microns in diameter, was more severe than that for unmyelinated axons. Regeneration, which was assessed by the number of clustered axons, decreased when the density of myelinated fibres decreased, suggesting that severe nerve ischaemia precludes axonal regeneration. Wallerian degeneration affected on average 58% (range 5-100%) and segmental demyelination, mainly of the secondary type, on average 1.94% (range 1-10%) of teased fibres. It was concluded that (1) myelinated fibres are more vulnerable to ischaemia than unmyelinated axons; (2) large myelinated fibres are affected before the smaller ones; (3) segmental demyelination is uncommon in this context; (4) severe nerve ischaemia precludes axonal regeneration. 
Five-year results of the first 159 consecutive phakic chronic open-angle glaucomas treated by argon laser trabeculoplasty. 159 phakic eyes with chronic open-angle glaucoma were treated by argon laser trabeculoplasty and followed for 5 years. According to our criteria of failure, 31 eyes were failures at 1 year (19%), 47 eyes at 2 years (30%), 66 eyes at 3 years (41%), 77 eyes at 4 years (48%) and 82 eyes at 5 years (52%). In the 77 eyes still controlled at 5 years, the intraocular pressure drop was 6.57 mm Hg and the initial medical treatment could be tapered or stopped in only 33 of the cases (43%). In the 82 failures, there was a greater percentage requiring surgery for pressure control during the first year after laser treatment: 16 trabeculectomies in 31 failures (52%). The initial mean intraocular pressures of 7 failures needing surgery during the first 2 months (27.22 mm Hg) and of the 27 failures needing surgery during the 5 year follow-up (24.41 mm Hg) were higher than the initial mean intraocular pressure of the 77 successful cases (22.67 mm Hg). In the 159 eyes followed for 5 years, 19% (31 eyes) to 6% (5 eyes) new failure cases per year were encountered and the initial good results obtained by argon laser trabeculoplasty persisted for about 5 years in half of the cases. 
Long-term response of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis to treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-N1. Papilloma Study Group. BACKGROUND. We earlier reported that patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis responded to six months of treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-n1. Because another study of patients treated for one year with leukocyte interferon alfa-n3 found that the growth rate of papillomas was slowed in the first six months but returned to base line during months 7 through 12 despite persistent interferon treatment, we now report the long-term results in our original study patients who were followed for a median of four years after the original one-year crossover study. METHODS. After the patients in our study had completed the first study year, their physicians could continue or recommence treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-n1 in a dose of either 2 MU per square meter of body-surface area per day or 4 MU per square meter every other day. The extent of disease was measured by endoscopy when clinically indicated. RESULTS. Data on late-follow-up were obtained for 60 of the 66 patients. There were 22 complete remissions and 25 partial remissions; 13 patients had no response. The median duration of the complete remissions was 550 days, and 15 patients continued to be in complete remission. The median duration of partial remissions was 400 days and seven patients were still in partial remission. Thirteen of 28 patients responded to a second course of interferon after an interruption in treatment of at least one month. The rate of response in the 11 of 53 patients who had neutralizing antibody to interferon was the same as in the patients without the antibody. CONCLUSIONS. Patients with severe recurrent respiratory papillomatosis may have a sustained or repeated response to treatment with lymphoblastoid interferon alfa-n1. We recommend that patients with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis who require surgery every two to three months be given a six-month trial of interferon alfa-n1. 
Left anterior fascicular block: an ischaemic response during treadmill testing. A patient in whom exercise induced reversible ischaemic left anterior fascicular block is reported. Glyceryl trinitrate relieved the fascicular block. Coronary angiography showed a 90% obstruction of the left anterior descending artery. The left anterior fascicular block induced by exercise disappeared after a successful coronary angioplasty. 
Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. Ultrastructural, immunohistochemical, and DNA cytofluorometric study of a case. A case of right frontal pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma that occurred in a 7-year-old boy is reported clinicopathologically. The patient underwent surgery on September 29, 1988. Histologic diagnosis of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma was made because, in addition to the unique pleomorphic histologic features, positive glial fibrillary acidic protein in immunohistochemical staining and characteristic ultrastructural features, i.e., cytoplasmic intermediate fibrils and lipid vacuoles, basal lamina, and abundant reticulin networks were demonstrated. The DNA cytofluorometric analysis of the nuclei of the tumor cells disclosed the main mode to be diploid with polyploid classes (4, 8, 16, and 32C) without any aneuploidy. Despite the presence of many pleomorphic nuclei, DNA histogram of the tumor disclosed very few DNA synthetic cells indicating a biologically inactive nature of the tumor. The patient is still alive and totally asymptomatic 20 months postoperatively. 
Osteomyelitis in children with sickle cell disease: early diagnosis with contrast-enhanced CT. Two children with sickle cell disease and osteomyelitis were treated. In one child, definitive treatment was delayed until computed tomography (CT) revealed a subperiosteal abscess. Early performance of CT in the other child resulted in prompt diagnosis and treatment. Before the appearance of the characteristic plain radiographic findings, diagnosis of osteomyelitis in patients with sickle cell disease can be difficult because the clinical manifestations of infarction and osteomyelitis can be similar. Radionuclide scans have yielded mixed results. In equivocal cases, early performance of CT can help establish the diagnosis of osteomyelitis to avoid significant morbidity. 
Cyclosporin A modulates the course of woodchuck hepatitis virus infection and induces chronicity. Immunosuppression is known to influence the state of chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and is thought to increase the risk of developing chronic infection in newly exposed individuals. Cyclosporin A (CsA), an immunosuppressive agent that inhibits Th cell function, was administered to woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), and resulted in a decreased severity of chronic hepatitis and an increased viremia during the treatment. Adult woodchucks inoculated with WHV and given CsA for 14 wk had increased viremias, decreased acute phase liver injury, and developed chronic infections at a higher rate compared with immunocompetent woodchucks given virus alone (chronicity in seven of seven WHV + CsA + vs zero of nine WHV + CsA-; p less than 0.001). These results in a relevant animal model of hepatitis B virus infection indicate: 1) that liver injury in acute hepadnavirus infections is immune-mediated and not a direct cytopathic effect of virus replication; 2) that Th cells function in the inflammatory response and in the immunologic control of hepadnavirus infection; and 3) that suppression of Th cell function in acute hepadnavirus infection decreases liver injury but alters the outcome of infection in favor of chronicity. These results also suggest continued challenges in the application of CsA in liver transplantation for hepatitis B virus-induced diseases. 
Occurrence of resting tremor in Parkinson's disease. Several previous studies have noted that resting tremor (RT) is absent in 10% to 30% of idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients. We report our 22-year observations in 47 pathologically verified parkinsonian patients. In all the IPD cases with median follow-up of 3.7 years, RT was noted on at least one evaluation. Among other parkinsonian syndrome variants characterized by widespread subcortical pathology with median follow-up of 2.86 years, RT was seen in 31% of the cases. Our data indicate that the sites typically involved in IPD are sufficient to produce RT. 
The spectrum of molecular alterations in the evolution of chronic myelocytic leukemia. DNA from 135 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) at various clinical stages and Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia was investigated for alterations in a variety of proto-oncogenes which have been implicated in the evolution of CML from its chronic phase to blast crisis. The most common genetic change found in the evolution of typical Ph1 chromosome positive CML to blast crisis was an alteration of the p53 gene involving either a rearrangement, a deletion, or a point mutation in the coding sequence of the gene. Alterations of the p53 gene were found in the myeloid and the rare megakaryocytic variant of blast crisis but were absent in the lymphoid leukemic transformants. Gross structural alterations were seen in 11 of 54 (20%) of myeloid or unknown phenotypes of blast crisis and in only 1 of 44 chronic phase cases. Eight examples of mutations in the open reading frame of the p53 gene at codons 49, 53, 60, 140, 202, 204, 238, and 239 were observed in blast crisis patients. Mutations in the N-RAS gene were rare in typical blast crisis (2 of 27 cases) but were found in megakaryocytic and Ph1 negative myeloid blast crisis. We concluded that heterogeneous alterations in the p53 gene and occasionally in the N-RAS genes accompany the evolution of chronic phase CML to blast crisis. 
Effect of peripheral cardiopulmonary bypass on left ventricular size, afterload and myocardial function during elective supported coronary angioplasty. Although cardiopulmonary bypass support has been increasingly used for high risk coronary angioplasty, few data exist regarding its effects on left ventricular function. Accordingly, in 20 patients changes in left ventricular size, afterload and myocardial function were assessed by continuous hemodynamic monitoring and simultaneous two-dimensional echocardiography during cardiopulmonary bypass-supported high risk angioplasty. The cross-sectional left ventricular area during bypass support remained unchanged during diastole, whereas during systole it decreased (from 29.6 +/- 11.4 to 27.6 +/- 10.4 cm2, p less than 0.05). Global left ventricular function expressed as fractional area change remained unchanged from baseline to bypass support but decreased during balloon inflation (from 0.27 +/- 0.11 to 0.17 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.001). The end-systolic meridional wall stress decreased during bypass support (from 141 +/- 75 to 110 +/- 58 x 10(3) dynes/cm2, p less than 0.02). Regional myocardial function was assessed by a wall motion score (0 = normal, 1 = hypokinesia, 2 = akinesia and 3 = dyskinesia). Regions supplied by a stenotic (greater than or equal to 50% diameter) vessel deteriorated during bypass support (score from 0.9 +/- 0.8 to 1.06 +/- 0.8, p less than 0.01), whereas regions supplied by a nonstenotic vessel did not. Regions supplied by the target vessel deteriorated further during balloon inflation (score from 0.7 +/- 0.6 to 1.7 +/- 0.75, p less than 0.001). Thus, although left ventricular size and global function remain unchanged and afterload decreases during bypass support, myocardial dysfunction in regions supplied by a stenotic vessel may occur. Furthermore, regional and global left ventricular dysfunction still occur with angioplasty balloon inflation during cardiopulmonary bypass support. 
Clinical evaluation of circulating serum sialyl Tn antigen levels in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. Sialyl Tn antigen (NeuAc alpha 2----6GalNac alpha 1----0-Ser/Thr [STN]) with antigenic specificity in the core structure of mucin-type carbohydrate chains has been determined. In the present study, we evaluated the clinical significance of this new carbohydrate antigen, STN, in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer. With the use of a radioimmunoassay developed to detect STN antigen in serum, elevated (greater than or equal to 32.6 U/mL) antigen levels were observed in 50.0% of patients with ovarian cancer. In contrast, 3.8% of healthy individuals had STN antigen levels greater than or equal to 32.6 U/mL. In 9.6% of patients with benign gynecologic diseases and 0% of pregnant women, there were elevated levels of STN antigen. There was a significant difference (P less than .001) in STN antigen levels between patients with ovarian cancer and patients with benign gynecologic diseases, pregnant women, or the controls. The mean +/- SD for all evaluated samples of ovarian cancer was 109.2 +/- 146.8 U/mL. Both the mean values and the positive rate increased as the stage advanced. Classified according to the histologic type, the highest positive rate (61.0%) was observed in mucinous adenocarcinoma. The usefulness of STN antigen as a circulating tumor marker in ovarian cancer was estimated as follows: sensitivity 50.0%, specificity 93.5%, positive predictive value 72.2%, negative predictive value 84.7%, and diagnostic value 46.8%. Serum STN antigen levels were elevated in 12 of 33 patients with ovarian cancer who had serum CA 125 antigen levels less than 35 U/mL. While CA 125 antigen levels were elevated in 74.6% and STN antigen levels were elevated in 50.0% of the same population, the use of both assays indicated the sensitivity of detection of 83.8% in the population studied. 
Acid peptic disease in adolescents. How to avoid misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Acid peptic disease in adolescents may be more common than previously recognized. However, appropriate medical attention is often delayed because of misdiagnosis and undertreatment. Thorough questioning of adolescent patients is important to elicit a complete description of symptoms. Endoscopy or intraluminal pH monitoring may be necessary to establish a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic ulcer. Therapy with histamine receptor antagonists, especially ranitidine (Zantac), is recommended. Antireflux surgery may be needed to prevent potential long-term gastrointestinal damage. Patients with duodenal ulcer should also be advised to make life-style changes to avoid recurrence of disease later in life. 
In-flight esophageal variceal bleeding en route for liver transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. Esophageal variceal bleeding owing to portal hypertension is a potential threat in pediatric patients awaiting liver transplantation. We report a case of a three-year-old boy with severe congenital hepatic fibrosis, Caroli's disease, and portal hypertension who developed a life-threatening variceal hemorrhage for the first time in his life during commercial air transport to a liver transplantation center. Factors precipitating variceal bleeding are discussed, particularly those resulting from changes in altitude. It is recommended that prophylactic treatment for variceal bleeding be at least considered in children awaiting liver transplantation prior to prolonged air transportation. Because of differences in capabilities of treatment providers in various locales, and because there are as yet no conclusive data, the treatment of choice must be decided on an individual basis. Equipment for treating in-flight hemorrhage should be available. 
Increased calcium influx in caudal artery of rats made hypertensive with pyridoxine deficiency. Moderate pyridoxine deficiency in rats has been shown to induce hypertension, which can be corrected by pyridoxine supplementation. In this study, calcium handling by isolated caudal arteries from pyridoxine-deficient and age-matched control rats was evaluated. We found 45Ca influx into the intracellular compartment to be significantly elevated in deficient rats. This increased influx could be attenuated with nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting alterations in the calcium channels that would make them leaky. The pyridoxine-deficient arterial segments maintained a higher resting tone; removal of extracellular calcium by EGTA or entry blockade by nifedipine decreased the tone significantly in the deficient arteries, compared with little or no effect in controls. 
Quantitative testicular biopsy in spinal cord injured men: comparison to fertile controls. Spermatogenic abnormalities have been reported in the majority of spinal cord injured men on routine testicular biopsy. However, given the interim advances in their urological and rehabilitative care, a quantitative assessment of the germinal epithelium after spinal cord injury and comparison of these parameters to normal controls are warranted. Incisional testicular biopsy was performed in 14 spinal cord injured men. Quantitative micrometric techniques were applied to assess spermatogenesis and the results were compared to a normative data base of testicular biopsies previously obtained from a group of 15 fertile volunteers. From a minimum of 10 randomly selected round seminiferous tubules per subject the mean number of Sertoli cells, mature spermatids, tubular diameter and tubular wall thickness were determined in both groups and statistically analyzed. In the spinal cord injury group the mean number of spermatids per tubule was significantly lower and the mean number of Sertoli cells per tubule was significantly higher than in fertile controls (p less than 0.05). Moreover, the mean Sertoli cell-to-spermatid ratio per seminiferous tubule was significantly higher in the spinal cord injury group and discriminated between spinal cord injured men and controls, with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100% (p less than 0.0001). Half of the spinal cord injury group showed a mean tubular spermatid density of less than 10. Compared to the fertile population, spinal cord injured men show significant differences in quantitative parameters of the germinal epithelium that may contribute to the reproductive dysfunction. 
Mesalamine in ulcerative colitis. Sulfasalazine has been used for many years in the management of ulcerative colitis. As many as 20 percent of patients treated with it experience intolerable adverse effects usually attributed to its sulfapyridine component. The other active component is 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA); the only 5-ASA enema preparation currently available in the U.S. is mesalamine (Rowasa, Reid-Rowell) containing 5-ASA 4 g in 60 mL. In clinical trials, mesalamine has proved efficacious in treating refractory cases of distal ulcerative colitis, proctitis, and proctosigmoiditis. Because of its high cost compared with more conventional treatment modalities, it should be reserved for cases that are either refractory or intolerant to conventional treatment. 
Intractable heart failure despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics: long-term effectiveness of add-on therapy with pimobendan. In 25 patients whose chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) had recently worsened to New York Heart Association class IV, pimobendan (5 to 20 mg/day) was added to maximum conventional therapy consisting of digoxin, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, coumadin derivatives to prevent thromboembolic complications, and amiodarone to suppress serious ventricular rhythm disturbances. CHF was fatal in less than 1 month in five patients (two had shown some initial improvement). The other 20 had sustained improvement by at least one functional class, interrupted by episodes of CHF that usually responded to intravenous therapy. Median survival was 12 months (range 10 days to greater than 3 years); five patients died suddenly, 12 died of intractable CHF, and two died of other causes. Six patients were alive 3 years after the onset of treatment with pimobendan. Add-on therapy with pimobendan produced a sustained improvement in many patients with severe CHF that was no longer responding to a combination of digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. 
Anatomy of the tricuspid annulus. Circumferential myofibers as the structural basis for atrial flutter in a canine model. BACKGROUND. Little anatomic information is available on the annular myocardium. This study was conducted to determine the anatomic substrate for atrial flutter due to circus movement around the tricuspid annulus in the Y-shaped incision canine model of atrial flutter. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied photographs of the annular myocardium serial histological sections, made in either of three different planes, and compared these with photographs of the intact and blocked gross heart specimens. We found that the annulus is the most caudal region of the atrial wall. The epicardial aspect of the annulus abuts the ventricular septum or the aortic root in the medial region; in other regions, it is covered by the fat of the coronary sulcus. Its endocardial aspect is delimited by the tricuspid leaflets inferiorly and by the pectinate muscle bundles superiorly, except in the medial region where the pectinate muscle bundles are absent. The annular myocardium is bilaminated. A continuous subepicardial circumferential lamina is the most prominent and is robust in the anterior, lateral, and posterior regions, but it attenuates to a fine muscular connection in the medial region. Myofibers of its superior border merge with the pectinate muscle bundles or are admixed in the medial region with myocardium at the base of the medial atrial wall. Its inferior border makes little contact with the annulus fibrosus about the ring; however, in the medial region, these myofibers insert into fibrous tissue superior to the septal leaflet. A discontinuous, subendocardial perpendicular lamina contains myofibers that descend from the atrium; most of these myofibers insert into the annulus fibrosus about the ring, but the lamina is absent in the anteromedial region. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that the continuous circumferential lamina provides the anatomic substrate for circus movement of excitation in this model. 
Correlation of circulating von Willebrand factor levels with cardiovascular hemodynamics. BACKGROUND. Valvular heart disease is associated with a decreased platelet circulating time and a thrombotic tendency. The possibility that these events are related to changes in von Willebrand factor (vWF), a multimeric glycoprotein released from endothelial cells and platelets that mediates platelet adhesion to the vascular subendothelium, has not been examined. METHODS AND RESULTS. We measured the vWF antigen (vWF:Ag) concentration in 43 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of mitral (n = 17) or aortic (n = 10) stenosis or nonvalvular heart disease (n = 16). Mean vWF:Ag concentration was significantly higher in patients with mitral stenosis than in those without (212 +/- 84 versus 150 +/- 79 units/dl, p less than 0.02); this elevation was associated with a significant elevation of pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in the patients with mitral stenosis (186 +/- 49 versus 133 +/- 81 dynes-sec-cm-5, p less than 0.02). The vWF:Ag levels in the entire group of patients (regardless of the presence or type of valvular disease) varied directly with PVR (r = 0.72, p less than 0.0001) and with pulmonary artery pressure (r = 0.60, p less than 0.0001) and inversely with cardiac output (r = 0.64, p less than 0.0001). Changes in PVR, pulmonary artery pressure, or cardiac output could not be correlated with circulating levels of fibrinogen or beta-thromboglobulin, which may be released from activated platelets, nor with the endothelial cell product tissue plasminogen activator. CONCLUSIONS. The association of high vWF:Ag levels with increased PVR and decreased cardiac output in patients both with and without mitral stenosis suggests a hemodynamically induced increase in the endothelial release of vWF, which might contribute to a thrombotic tendency in these patients. 
Fifteen-year results of ambulatory compression therapy for chronic venous ulcers. A nonoperative approach to venous stasis ulceration of the lower extremity, consisting of initial bedrest, ulcer cleansing, dressing changes, and ambulatory elastic compression stocking therapy, has been maintained for over 15 years. All patients had class III, severe chronic venous insufficiency. One hundred five of 113 patients (93%) experienced complete ulcer healing in a mean of 5.3 months. One hundred two patients were compliant with elastic compression stockings, and 11 patients were noncompliant. Complete ulcer healing occurred in 99 of 102 patients (97%) who were compliant versus six of 11 patients (55%) who were noncompliant (p less than 0.0001). The influence of noncompliance, previous venous ulceration, previous venous surgery, previous known deep venous thrombosis, peripheral arterial insufficiency (ankle brachial systolic blood pressure index less than or equal to 0.60), pretreatment ulcer duration, ulcer size, age, sex, diabetes, smoking, and photoplethysmography venous refill time on ulcer healing was determined by logistic regression analysis. Only noncompliance with elastic compression stockings (p less than 0.0001) and a pretreatment ulcer duration of more than 9 months (p = 0.02) significantly decreased initial ulcer healing. Posthealing follow-up was available in 73 patients for a mean of 30 months. Fifty-eight patients (79%) continued to be compliant with stockings; 15 patients were noncompliant. Total ulcer recurrence in patients who were compliant was 16%. Five-year lifetable recurrence was 29%. All patients who were noncompliant had recurrent ulceration by 36 months. Previous ulceration, previous venous surgery, and peripheral arterial insufficiency had no effect on ulcer recurrence (p greater than 0.05). 
Endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophages in hypertension. Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition. Hypertension is associated with an impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation. The angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors captopril and cilazapril can prevent this endothelial dysfunction. We recently observed that long-term treatment with cilazapril could also prevent subendothelial infiltration by mononuclear cells in spontaneously hypertensive rats. This prompted us to examine whether, in spontaneously hypertensive rats, endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial infiltration by mononuclear cells are associated. These cells were characterized as monocyte macrophages. Infiltration by monocyte macrophages was quantified by morphometry. Endothelial function was estimated by calculating serotonin ratio (maximal contraction to serotonin on isolated arterial rings with endothelium over maximal contraction on paired rings without endothelium). The regional distribution of endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophages was similar. Both were maximal in the carotid artery, less in the aorta, and nonexistent in the renal artery. A 2-week treatment with cilazapril decreased both endothelial dysfunction (serotonin ratio decreased by 32%) and the number of subendothelial monocyte macrophages in the aorta, which decreased by 38%. We conclude that in spontaneously hypertensive rats, endothelial dysfunction and subendothelial monocyte macrophage infiltration are associated and that cilazapril can decrease both. The observation that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors affect subendothelial accumulation of monocyte macrophage may lead to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of this class of drugs. 
Comparison of four subarachnoid solutions in a needle-through-needle technique for elective caesarean section. We have used both spinal and extradural anaesthesia with a 26-gauge, long spinal needle through a 16-gauge Tuohy needle for elective Caesarean section. Four different subarachnoid solutions of bupivacaine were compared: 0.5% heavy bupivacaine alone, or with adrenaline, fentanyl or adrenaline and fentanyl. The incidence of complications and time of regression of the sensory block were analysed. The technique is recommended because it allows rapid onset of anaesthesia and the advantages of an extradural catheter. The subarachnoid solution of choice was 0.5% heavy bupivacaine 12.5 mg with fentanyl 10 micrograms. 
Severe congestive heart failure. How successful are drug and transplant therapies? Severe congestive heart failure is a fatal illness. Aggressive use of proven medical regimens, including vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prolong survival time for some patients. Those with refractory symptoms and seriously reduced left ventricular function, impaired exercise capacity, and complex or frequent ventricular arrhythmias should be considered for cardiac transplantation. Candidacy for transplantation is based on the absence of other illnesses that would limit survival or diminish the likelihood of success of the transplant. With the introduction of potent immunosuppressive agents, particularly cyclosporine (Sandimmune), survival rates after transplantation have improved to 90% at 1 year. Major problems include organ rejection, serious infection, development of coronary artery disease in the transplanted heart, and the limited donor organ supply. 
Enhancement of ischaemic rabbit skin flap survival with the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine. 1. The burst of damaging oxygen free-radicals at the time of reperfusion is one of the crucial factors affecting skin flap survival after an ischaemic interval. In these experiments the efficacy of the antioxidant and free-radical scavenger N-acetylcysteine in improving the survival of ischaemic rabbit epigastric skin flaps was tested. 2. At the time of reperfusion flaps were given: (1) balanced salt solution by intravenous whole-body administration, (2) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intravenous whole-body administration, (3) balanced salt solution by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, (4) N-acetylcysteine (20 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap, or (5) N-acetylcysteine (200 mg/kg) by intra-arterial infusion into the flap. Flap survival at 1 week, and tissue levels of parameters related to free-radical production, blood levels of thromboxane B2 and peripheral resistance during reperfusion were determined. 3. Compared with controls (groups 1 and 3) which had flap survival rates (expressed as percentage surface area surviving) of 27.1% and 31.6%, respectively. N-acetylcysteine treatment in group 2 (55.2%) and group 4 (51.9%) resulted in significant (P less than 0.05) improvements in flap survival. The survival rate in group 5 (37.7%) was not significantly better than that of the controls. 4. N-Acetylcysteine significantly reduced parameters related to free-radical production in the skin flap after 30 min of reperfusion, determined as tissue levels of malonyldialdehyde and protein oxidation products. There was also a significant decrease in peripheral resistance when low-dose N-acetylcysteine (group 4) was infused intra-arterially into the flap. 
Interference between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep in near miss SIDS. GER may be considered as one of the triggering factors in some apparently life-threatening events or even SIDS. Also at the present time, many teams perform 24-h pH monitoring in at-risk infants and treat those with abnormal scores. However, further investigations are needed to answer the question: Which unknown additional factor(s) is present when a specific episode of GER causes apnea and/or bradycardia either during sleep or wakefulness?. 
Evaluation and treatment of aneurysms of the vertebral artery: different strategies for different lesions. Aneurysms of the vertebral artery and its branches are relatively uncommon lesions. Their anatomy and presentation can be quite variable. A spectrum of aneurysms of the vertebral artery is presented to illustrate the neuroradiological evaluation, surgical treatment, and perioperative management of these complex lesions. 
Bladder compliance in myelodysplastic children: effect of anti-reflux surgery and conservative treatment. Paediatric urology. Little is known about changes in bladder compliance and bladder capacity in myelodysplastic patients following anti-reflux surgery. A study group of 70 patients was divided as follows: group A included 20 myelodysplastic patients who had been operated on for reflux and whose subsequent treatment was conservative. Group B comprised 31 myelodysplastic patients who had been treated conservatively; a third group of 19 non-myelodysplastic patients, treated by anti-reflux surgery because of primary reflux, formed the control group. The follow-up period for group A averaged 61 months (extending from a urodynamic study 3 months after surgery to the most recent test). In group B the mean follow-up period between the initial test and the latest test was 86 months. Bladder compliance in group A patients did not increase significantly (from 5.5 to 6.9), but patients in group B did show a significant increase (from 5.9 to 10.7). Compliance in the 19 non-myelodysplastic patients decreased only marginally 6 months after surgery (from 29.6 to 26.3). Changes in bladder capacity showed a similar trend. In their most recent test, however, the bladder capacity of group A patients increased to the same volume as that of group B. A high correlation between radiological bladder deformity and bladder compliance was found. We propose a bladder compliance of 10.0 as the lower limit for myelodysplastic patients' preferred range. It was concluded that anti-reflux operations prevent any improvement in bladder compliance (but not in bladder capacity) compared with conservative treatment. 
The opacity of portal hypertension-related ascites correlates with the fluid's triglyceride concentration. To determine if an elevated triglyceride concentration can explain the opacity of some cirrhotic ascites specimens, the authors measured triglyceride concentration by Coulter DACOS (Hialeah, FL) on 133 paired serum and ascitic fluid specimens. The specimens were categorized as clear or cloudy by coded visual inspection. In addition, the ascitic fluid specimens were inspected for a lipid supernatant after 48 hours of refrigeration at 4 degrees C. The ascitic fluid triglyceride concentration of the 87 clear specimens was 1.9 +/- 1.0 mmol/L compared with 7.0 +/- 4.6 mmol/L for the opalescent specimens (P less than 0.001). Only 17% of the clear specimens demonstrated any lipid layer after refrigeration, compared with 94% of opalescent specimens (P less than 0.001). The triglyceride concentrations were not significantly different between the serum samples obtained from patients with clear compared with opalescent ascites. The opacity of portal hypertension-related ascites appears to be related to the triglyceride concentration of the fluid. 
Spinal cord pial metastases: MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine. The purpose of this investigation was to describe gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced MR findings in metastatic disease to the pial lining of the spinal cord. Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinomas (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS. We conclude that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of pial spread of metastatic disease in patients with a known primary malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms. 
Facial nerve monitoring in acoustic tumor surgery. Anatomic and functional preservation of the facial nerve during acoustic tumor surgery remains a primary goal. Intraoperative electromyographic facial nerve monitoring with auditory feedback has enabled the surgeon to more readily achieve this goal. We compared a group of monitored translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removals (N = 89) to a similar unmonitored group (N = 155) in regard to facial nerve function. Function was assessed immediately postoperatively, at time of discharge, and at 1 year postoperatively using the House six-point scale. Results were grouped as satisfactory, intermediate, or poor and were analyzed by tumor size. Facial nerve results were better at all time intervals in the monitored groups, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 1-year interval. There was no difference between monitored and unmonitored patients in the subgroups with tumors smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter. This study supports the usefulness of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in improving facial nerve results, particularly in larger tumors. 
Fatal persistent pulmonary hypertension presenting late in the neonatal period. Two cases of fatal idiopathic persistent pulmonary hypertension presented late in the neonatal period. Lungs were examined histologically by light and electron microscopy, and immunocytochemical studies were used to identify nerves. There was extension of medial smooth muscle distally along the arterial pathway so that most precapillary arteries had completely muscular walls, which in some cases completely obliterated the vessel lumen. Enlarged endothelial cells also contributed to the reduction in the size of the lumen. Nerve fibres accompanying muscular arteries were found in the alveolar region, more distal than is normal. The predominant neuropeptide was the vasoconstrictor tyrosine. Possible aetiological factors in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn are increased muscularity of the peripheral pulmonary arteries antenatally, an increase in the number of vasoconstrictor nerves, or an imbalance in the production of leukotrienes and prostacyclins in the perinatal period. 
False aneurysm of the right internal mammary artery. False aneurysm of the internal mammary artery is an uncommon complication of median sternotomy. Clinical and radiological findings of 2 such cases are presented. At operative exploration neither was directly related to the presence of a sternal wire. 
Continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block after pleurectomy. A randomised, double blind trial was carried out in 16 patients undergoing pleurectomy to assess the effect of continuous extrapleural intercostal block on postoperative pain and pulmonary function. Subjective pain relief was assessed on a linear visual analogue scale. Pulmonary function was measured on the day before operation and daily for five days after surgery. Eight patients received bupivacaine and eight placebo (saline). The mean pain scores at 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours were 13.3, 8.5, 6.1, and 10 mm respectively in the bupivacaine group compared with 56.3, 41, 46.7, and 35 in the control group; in addition, the bupivacaine group required less papaveretum. Twenty four hours after surgery mean values of peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in one second, and forced vital capacity were reduced to 82%, 76%, and 76% of preoperative control values in the bupivacaine group, and to 39%, 32%, and 36% in the control group. The speed of recovery of pulmonary function was superior in the bupivacaine group. There were no complications related to the infusion. Continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve blockade with bupivacaine provides safe and effective postoperative analgesia and improves respiratory mechanics after pleurectomy. 
Oral contraceptive-associated liver cell adenoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Cytomorphology and mechanism of malignant transformation. From January 1976 to May 1990, 1673 patients with a liver mass or masses detected by imaging techniques underwent percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the liver. Of these, 99 were diagnosed cytologically as "hepatocellular carcinoma" and 9 as "consistent with liver cell adenoma." The cytologic diagnoses were confirmed in the follow-up of all cases. Among the 99 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 3 had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 10, 11, and 12 years, respectively. The nine patients with liver cell adenoma were all users of oral contraceptives over a period ranging from 5 to 10 years. Of these, two who had taken oral contraceptives for a period of 8 and 10 years, respectively, had foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia within the adenomas. The cytologic criteria for the diagnosis of liver cell dysplasia included cytoplasmic and nuclear enlargement, nuclear pleomorphism together with prominent nucleoli, hyperchromasia and multinucleation. The cytologic features of liver cell dysplasia strikingly mimic hepatocellular carcinoma. From this study, the foci or areas of liver cell dysplasia arising within the liver cell adenomas appear to be the missing link responsible for the transformation of liver cell adenoma to carcinoma. It is believed that liver cell adenomas are not premalignant and may undergo reversible change after withdrawal of causative agents, whereas liver cell dysplasia is an irreversible, premalignant change and will eventually progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Turbinate hypertrophy in habitual snorers and patients with obstructive sleep apnea: findings of acoustic rhinometry. Forty-five habitual snorers (mean respiratory disturbance index = 6) and 22 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (mean respiratory disturbance index = 36) were examined by polysomnography, radiocephalometry, rhinomanometry, nasopharyngeal videoendoscopy, and acoustic rhinometry. In 97% of these patients, hypertrophy of the inferior nasal turbinates was found by acoustic rhinometry, while increased nasal resistance of various degrees was measured in 93% of all patients by active anterior rhinomanometry. Acoustic rhinometry demonstrated that the most resistive segment was located in the anterior parts of the nasal cavity and was built up by two compartments: the region of the isthmus nasi and the region of the head of the inferior turbinate. In our snoring patients, the cross-sectional areas at the head of the inferior turbinate were always smaller than the cross-sectional areas in the isthmus nasi, which in normal controls presented the minimal cross-sectional values of the whole nasal cavity. While rhino-manometry can only measure the amount of nasal resistance, acoustic rhinometry can clearly determine the exact size and location of the different stenoses in the nasal cavity that contribute to the increased nasal resistance. 
The human hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen (CD34) in vascular neoplasia. The human hematopoietic progenitor cell antigen CD34 is synthesized and expressed by early normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and by many acute leukemias. Anti-CD34 antibodies also have been reported to stain blood vessels in tissue sections, and, more recently, CD34 mRNA has been detected in vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, the authors studied the diagnostic utility of immunohistochemical CD34 antigen detection in tumors of endothelial cell derivation and compared the results with stains for von Willebrand (vW) factor. A wide variety of epithelial and mesenchymal neoplasms also were examined to assess the specificity of CD34 for vascular neoplasia. Seven cases of angiosarcoma (seven of seven), five cases of Kaposi's sarcoma (five of five), and eight cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (eight of eight) were moderately to strongly positive for CD34. This reactivity was equally intense in frozen sections, alcohol-fixed tissue, and formalin-fixed specimens. In many cases, the malignant endothelial cells stained more strongly than adjacent benign endothelium. Moreover, in most cases CD34 positivity was quantitatively and qualitatively stronger than staining for vW factor. Two cases of hemangiopericytoma (two of two) were CD34 positive but stained less intensely than the angiosarcomas, Kaposi's sarcomas, or hemangioendotheliomas. Five of six cases of hemangioma also stained positively for CD34; the nonreactive tumor in this group was the only one among 28 vascular neoplasms studied that was not reactive for CD34. In comparison, 9 of the 28 vascular tumors did not stain for vW factor. Three hundred fifty-seven tumors of nonvascular derivation also were examined for CD34 antigen expression. Focal light staining was seen in one pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma; moderate to intense staining was observed in half of the epithelioid sarcomas studied (8 of 16) and in a minority of leiomyosarcomas (3 of 22). These findings indicate that CD34 is a sensitive and relatively specific marker for neoplasms of vascular origin. 
A case of vesical paraganglioma behind the symphysis pubis. We report on a 15-year-old boy with a vesical paraganglioma behind the symphysis pubis. Magnetic resonance imaging and transurethral intravesical ultrasonography were helpful in the preoperative localization of the lesion. 
Non-specific aorto-arteritis (Takayasu's disease) in children. Digital subtraction panaorto-arteriography was performed in 32 consecutive children (21 females, mean age 10.8 years) with non-specific aorto-arteritis to assess digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in imaging these children and to study the patterns of involvement in the Indian sub-continent. Diagnostic quality DSA images were obtained in 21 out of 27 intravenous and nine out of 11 intra-arterial studies. Obstructive lesions were present in all the patients and commonly involved the abdominal aorta (24 patients) and renal arteries (20 patients). Aneurysms were seen in five patients and predominantly involved the descending thoracic aorta. Pulmonary artery involvement was uncommon (five out of 20 patients) and clinically silent. Based on clinical and angiographic features, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed for the management of uncontrolled hypertension in eight patients (10 lesions). Initial success was obtained in eight procedures (80%). Re-stenosis occurred after 5.5 months in one patient, but was successfully re-dilated. The follow-up period ranged between 5 and 16 months (mean 9 months). Long-term efficacy of transluminal angioplasty in the management of these children is awaited. 
Compulsive overeating. Compulsive overeating is a behavior used in an attempt to numb or nurture feelings that are threatening to the person. Emotional states are soothed by use of food. Treatment is designed to respond to internal, biologic causes of hunger and satiety while simultaneously allowing feelings to surface and be dealt with. Work on the inner child enables the person to identify and deal with unmet needs and correct distortions from childhood. The secondary gain realized from the extra weight is examined, and direct means of dealing with these needs explored. The focus of recovery is on learning to nurture the self, physically and emotionally. 
Intralesional interferon alfa-2b in the treatment of basal cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical study on cellular immune reaction leading to tumor regression. Four patients with basal cell carcinomas were treated with intralesional injections of interferon alfa-2b (1.5 million IU per injection) three times a week for 2 weeks. Histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens of the lesions confirmed the absence of basal cell carcinoma in all cases 4 weeks after completion of therapy. A dense mononuclear cell infiltrate and numerous ectatic blood vessels were present in the dermis at the sites of previous basal cell carcinoma. Immunohistologic analysis of the dermal infiltrate revealed a marked increase of Leu-4+ T cells with a slight predominance of Leu-3+ helper/inducer T cells over Leu-2+ suppressor/cytotoxic T cells. Most of the dermal infiltrate expressed HLA-DR antigen. In addition, Leu-11+ natural killer cells were observed in the dermal infiltrate. Immunohistologic changes in the skin lesions at the sites of previous basal cell carcinoma suggest that intralesional interferon alfa-2b acts on tumor cells by enhancement of local T-cell-mediated immune responses. 
Recurrent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade in a patient with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome. We describe a patient with hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome complicated by recurrent pericarditis and cardiac tamponade. The episodes of pericarditis were associated with urticarial vasculitis, hypocomplementemia, and circulating IgG antibodies to the collagen-like region of Clq. Histopathologic examination of the skin and pericardium demonstrated vasculitis associated with immunoglobulin and complement deposition suggesting an immune complex mediated etiology. Recurrent pericarditis should be included in the clinical spectrum of hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis syndrome. 
Gonococcal endocarditis complicating pregnancy: a case report and literature review. The incidence of gonorrhea has decreased substantially in the past decade. Disseminated gonorrhea is more common in women than in men, although gonococcal endocarditis is more common in men. Disseminated gonorrhea is most commonly described in women during menses or pregnancy. Only two cases of gonococcal endocarditis during pregnancy have been reported in the literature since 1942. We report a patient who experienced sudden hemodynamic decompensation at 30 weeks' gestation, resulting in fetal death. Aortic valve replacement was performed, but extensive involvement of the aortic root made complete eradication of infection impossible and eventually resulted in maternal death. 
Survival and management considerations in postirradiation osteosarcoma and Paget's osteosarcoma. Postirradiation and Paget's osteosarcomas are high-grade malignancies. The five-year survival was only 10% in recent experience at the author's institution. Progressive pain is an important clinical feature in both conditions. Careful roentgenographic studies demonstrate cortical destruction and a soft-tissue mass in virtually all patients. Metastasis was present in 25% of both groups of patients at presentation. In contrast to previous series, more than 80% of the patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma had had irradiation for malignant entities and more than 70% had been treated with modern radiotherapy regimens (cobalt-60 or linear accelerator). Twice as many patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma were evaluated and treated in the 1980s than in the previous decade. The initial indication for irradiation often was carcinoma of the breast, uterus, or cervix, or lymphoma. Two-thirds of the patients had progressive disease that was not controllable within six months after diagnosis. Early detection may be the only effective means of improving survival with postirradiation or Paget's osteosarcoma. These patients require lifelong follow-up evaluations. 
Routine computed tomographic scans, selective mediastinoscopy, and other factors in evaluation of lung cancer. Routine computed tomographic scan is advocated as the best noninvasive method of evaluating mediastinal nodes for cancer spread. Positive studies should be confirmed histologically. Large size, central location, unfavorable cell type, poor cellular differentiation of the primary cancer, and weight loss also correlate with increased likelihood of mediastinal involvement. 
Toxic shock syndrome after pilonidal cystectomy. Report of a case. Toxic shock syndrome is an uncommon disease associated with staphylococcal infections. Although most frequently reported in menstruating women and associated with tampon use, toxic shock syndrome has been described following many types of surgical procedures. In this report we describe a case of toxic shock syndrome occurring in a previously healthy young man after elective surgery for a pilonidal cyst. 
Recovery after intense chronic stimulation: a physiological study of cat's fast muscle. Adult cats were used to study the recovery of muscles that had become altered by long-term electrical stimulation. Chronic activation was delivered to the deafferented common peroneal nerve (no pain, no reflexes), and contractile properties were measured for peroneus longus muscle. After 4 wk of great daily amounts of treatment at moderately high pulse rates (30-40 Hz delivered during 50% of daily time), the peroneus longus became considerably weaker, demonstrated a longer time course of twitches and a slower rate of rise of tetanic force, and became less fatigable. Furthermore, its twitch-to-tetanus ratio decreased, and there was no longer any depression of electromyogram (EMG) amplitude during fatigue tests. After 4 wk of subsequent rest it was found that 1) twitch speed and maximum tetanic force had returned to nearly normal values, 2) fatigue resistance showed some return toward normal but was still significantly enhanced, and 3) no significant recovery had yet occurred of the altered twitch-to-tetanus ratio, the abolished EMG depression, or the slowed rate of rise of tetanic tension. During the poststimulation recovery period, the progressive increase of isometric twitch speed was not promoted by the administration of small daily amounts of high-rate stimulation (100-Hz bursts). The results support the conclusions that 1) the time course of recovery differs among physiological properties, 2) the EMG and force reactions that occur during a fatigue test are not strongly coupled, as demonstrated by the alterations of their relationship during poststimulation recovery, and 3) in cat's fast muscles, there is still no evidence for rate-specific effects of chronic stimulation on isometric twitch speed. 
POEMS syndrome with idiopathic flushing mimicking carcinoid syndrome. POEMS syndrome, a rare multisystem disease, is a variant of osteosclerotic myeloma and is characterized by polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal proteins, and skin changes. Presented herein is a case of POEMS syndrome with flushing. The flushing was intermittent, involving the face and upper third of the trunk, and was associated with hypotension and bronchospasm. Final diagnosis was made by biopsy examination of an axillary lymph node, which showed angiofollicular hyperplasia that stained strongly and selectively for lambda light chains. The patient had most of the typical features of POEMS syndrome but was unique in that her most striking finding was carcinoid-like flushing. The flushing improved with steroid therapy, as did some of the other clinical features of her disease. This case suggests that idiopathic flushing can be added to the skin changes observed in POEMS syndrome. 
Magnetic resonance imaging shows specific abnormalities in the MELAS syndrome. The MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) can be difficult to identify. We report MRI abnormalities that we believe are specific to this disorder in three patients with complete or partial MELAS syndrome. The patients all showed an unusual pattern on T2-weighted MRI with multifocal areas of hyperintense signal confined to the cortex of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and adjacent white matter. Some images suggested selective cortical involvement of deeper layers only. Deep white matter was relatively spared, distinguishing this from usual cerebrovascular disease or the edema after status epilepticus. Specificity of these findings is further suggested by a good correlation of these findings with the previously described unique postmortem brain pathology of MELAS. 
Examination of cardiorespiratory changes during upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Comparison of monitoring of arterial oxygen saturation, arterial pressure and the electrocardiogram. Critical events including hypoxaemia, arrhythmias and myocardial ischaemia may occur more frequently during endoscopic procedures than during anaesthesia. A study was undertaken to assess the cardiovascular changes and to evaluate suitable monitoring techniques to detect critical events during sedation and endoscopy. Twenty patients scheduled to undergo a prolonged endoscopic procedure which required deep sedation were studied. Continuous recordings of electrocardiogram, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were made and arterial pressure was recorded at one-minute intervals. The study commenced immediately before administration of sedatives, continued for the duration of the examination and for one hour following the examination. Oxygen saturation decreased in all patients during the examination to a mean of 82.9% (SD 11.9), and remained below baseline for the duration of the examination and into the recovery period. Statistically significant increases and reductions of systolic arterial pressure and rate-pressure product were found during the procedures compared with baseline values recorded before administration of sedatives. Sixteen of the 20 patients developed tachycardia during the examination. Ten patients developed ectopic foci which were supraventricular, ventricular or both in origin. Electrocardiogram changes resolved during the recovery period. Myocardial ischaemia was assessed by S-T segment depression and a significant correlation was found between S-T segment depression and hypoxaemia, although the magnitude of the S-T depression was small and may not have been detected clinically. No correlation was found between S-T segment depression and arterial pressure, heart rate or rate-pressure product. 
Childhood epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Report of three cases and review of literature. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is an acquired subepidermal blistering disease with variable clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features. The disease has been reported infrequently in adults and only rarely in children. We describe three new cases of childhood epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, review three previously reported cases, and contrast the features of the disease in children with those in adults. The results suggest that both children and adults with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita have variable clinical and pathologic features that may mimic other bullous diseases. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is characterized by a chronic course, poor response to therapy, and occasional clinical remissions. 
Digitalis and beta-blocking agents: effects on depression following myocardial infarction. Depression is frequently seen in patients following myocardial infarction (MI), many of whom are receiving digitalis glycosides, beta-blockers, or other agents that may exert central nervous system (CNS) effects. In a prospective study of the clinical significance of post-MI depression, 335 patients were assessed using a standardized diagnostic interview for depression at 8 to 10 days, and 190 were reinterviewed at 3 to 4 months. Patients prescribed digitalis, beta-blockers, or other cardioactive medications at hospital discharge were identified. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the contribution of these agents to depression at 3 to 4 months, controlling for medical and sociodemographic factors as well as for baseline depression. Treatment with digitalis predicted depression at 3 to 4 months (p less than 0.05); no other medications, including beta-blockers, predicted depression (p greater than 0.10). Digitalis may have CNS effects that contribute to depression post-MI and this finding should be considered in the differential diagnosis of depression in cardiac patients. 
Older age and elevated blood pressure are risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolysis. Intracerebral hemorrhage is an important concern after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, but risk factors are controversial. Accordingly, we assessed risk factors in 107 treated patients of whom 4 had intracerebral hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage occurred at a mean of 25 hours (range 3.5 to 48) after therapy and was fatal in 2 patients. Significant differences were found between patients with and without intracerebral hemorrhage for age (77 +/- 7 vs 62 +/- 11 years, p less than or equal to 0.01), and initial (161 +/- 23 vs 135 +/- 23 mm Hg, p less than or equal to 0.03) and maximal (171 +/- 30 vs 146 +/- 20, p less than or equal to 0.02) systolic blood pressures. Initial and maximal diastolic blood pressures also tended to be higher (101 +/- 25 vs 86 +/- 16, p less than or equal to 0.07; 104 +/- 24 vs 90 +/- 13, p less than or equal to 0.06). Differences did not achieve significance for comparisons of gender, height, weight, site of infarction, time to therapy, specific thrombolytic agent used, concomitant therapy, interventions and partial thromboplastin time. It is concluded that age (greater than or equal to 70 years) and elevated blood pressure (greater than or equal to 150/95 mm Hg) are important risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage. The overall balance of benefit and risk of thrombolysis should continue to be assessed by large mortality trials. 
Extended aortic root replacement with cryopreserved allografts: do they hold up? The extended aortic root replacement technique is used for the surgical repair of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction complicated by concurrent hypoplastic aortic annulus, multiple levels of obstruction, or aortic insufficiency. Extended aortic root replacement incorporates the concepts of aortic root replacement and aortoventriculoplasty to create a comparatively simple procedure. Unique features of the technique include the implantation of an allograft, which makes the need for anticoagulation obsolete, and use of the donor mitral leaflet to enlarge the outflow tract. Since 1985, 32 patients in Denver have undergone placement of a cryopreserved aortic valve allograft as part of extended aortic root replacement. There were four hospital deaths (13%), and 1 child underwent cardiac transplantation 30 hours after operation. In 6 months to 4.8 years of follow-up, a 14-year-old boy with familial hyperlipidemia required coronary artery bypass grafting, and 3 children experienced allograft calcification with progressive insufficiency, which prompted allograft replacement. The other 23 patients are clinically well. 
Non-antireflux versus antireflux ureteroneocystostomy in adults. A retrospective analysis of ureteric reimplantation in adults showed that a high proportion (71%) had been treated by non-antireflux procedures. Analysis of the ureteroneocystostomy success rate in aetiological groups where either antireflux or non-antireflux techniques were used indicated the superiority of antireflux surgery in the prevention of reflux. The risk of stenosis at the site of anastomosis was equal in both groups. No significant difference in the preservation of renal function was detected in the 2 groups. It was concluded that antireflux procedures offered no advantage over non-antireflux ureteric reimplantation in adults. 
Acute cor pulmonale secondary to metastatic tumor to the heart: a case report and literature review. Metastatic tumors to the heart are becoming more common due to improved survival afforded by advanced treatment of malignancies. Their presence should be sought in a cancer patient who develops new primary cardiac symptoms. We present a case of a 50-year-old woman who succumbed to acute cor pulmonale secondary to metastatic laryngeal carcinoma to the right ventricle with subsequent tumor emboli to the pulmonary vasculature. 
Tentorial subdural hemorrhage in term newborns: ultrasonographic diagnosis and clinical correlates. Tentorial subdural hemorrhage with its supratentorial and infratentorial extensions were diagnosed by cranial ultrasonography and computed tomography in 9 term newborns. Vacuum extraction or forceps delivery was used in 6 patients. Abnormal neurologic manifestations developed after a period of normality in 8 patients. Increased intracranial pressure was the most common presentation. All patients had hemorrhage at the falcotentorial junction near the incisura; 5 also had hemorrhage around the tentorial leaflet. Posterior fossa retrocerebellar subdural hemorrhage developed in 5 patients and posterior interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage developed in 4. All 6 patients who received conservative treatment had normal neurodevelopmental outcomes. Of the other 3 patients upon whom suboccipital craniotomies were performed, only 1 had a normal outcome. Although it localized the tentorial subdural hemorrhage either at the incisura area or at the tentorial leaflet, ultrasonography failed to identify all patients with retrocerebellar or posterior interhemispheric subdural hemorrhage. Parturitional tentorial subdural hemorrhage may not be uncommon. Ultrasonography and computed tomography are complementary in the diagnosis. Surgical decompression of the posterior fossa subdural hematoma is necessary only in the presence of acute hydrocephalus or signs of brainstem compression. 
Efficacy of a postoperative regimen of enoxaparin in deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Venous thromboembolism is a common complication in patients undergoing elective hip replacement, in whom the incidence of calf vein thrombosis is 40% to 60%; proximal vein thrombosis, 20%; and fatal pulmonary embolism, 1% to 2% when prophylaxis is not used. A double-blind, randomized trial comparing low-molecular-weight heparin (enoxaparin) with placebo for the prevention of venous thrombosis in patients undergoing elective hip surgery was carried out. Prophylactic treatment with a fixed dose was begun postoperatively and continued for 14 days. Fifty patients in each treatment group underwent surveillance with 125I-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography. In the first 24 patients, venography was performed only if their surveillance test was positive. Venography was requested in the remaining 76 patients even if the screening tests were negative; in this latter group, venous thrombosis occurred in 4 patients (10.8%) given enoxaparin and 20 patients (51.3%) given placebo (p = 0.0002). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombosis were 5.4% and 23.1%, respectively (p = 0.029). In the entire group of 100 patients, venous thrombosis occurred in 12% of those given enoxaparin and 42% of those given placebo (p = 0.0007). The corresponding rates for proximal vein thrombi were 4% and 20%, respectively (p = 0.014). The observed hemorrhagic rate was 5% in each treatment group. The results of this study show that prophylaxis with fixed-dose enoxaparin is effective and safe for patients undergoing elective hip replacement. 
Liposarcoma of the esophagus. Liposarcoma is one of the most common soft tissue sarcomas found in adults, yet it rarely develops in the alimentary tract. This report describes the pathological features and management of a liposarcoma of the esophagus. 
Testing for association between disease and linked marker loci: a log-linear-model analysis. One approach frequently used for identifying genetic factors involved in the process of a complex disease is the comparison of patients and controls for a number of genetic markers near a candidate gene. The analysis of such association studies raises some specific problems because of the fact that genotypic and not gametic data are generally available. We present a log-linear-model analysis providing a valid method for analyzing such studies. When studying the association of disease with one marker locus, the log-linear model allows one to test for the difference between allelic frequencies among affected and unaffected individuals, Hardy-Weinberg (H-W) equilibrium in both groups, and interaction between the association of alleles at the marker locus and disease. This interaction provides information about the dominance of the disease susceptibility locus, with dominance defined using the epidemiological notion of odds ratio. The degree of dominance measured at the marker locus depends on the strength of linkage disequilibrium between the marker locus and the disease locus. When studying the association of disease with several linked markers, the model becomes rapidly complex and uninterpretable unless it is assumed that affected and unaffected populations are in H-W equilibrium at each locus. This hypothesis must be tested before going ahead in the analysis. If it is not rejected, the log-linear model offers a stepwise method of identification of the parameters causing the difference between populations. This model can be extended to any number of loci, alleles, or populations. 
Comparison of image analysis and flow cytometric determination of cellular DNA content. A good correlation (r = 0.94) was obtained between the DNA indices (DI) using flow cytometry and image analysis of nuclei cytospins extracted from paraffin wax embedded tumour sections. Some of the limitations and problems associated with image analysis which came to light included an unacceptably high coefficient of variation (CV) and a "left-shift" in the DI in most DNA histograms obtained when using image analysis of 5 microns sections. In contrast, the DNA histograms generated using image analysis of cytospun nuclei from paraffin wax blocks were of good quality and similar to those obtained using flow cytometry. Variability in Feulgen staining was common and an important source of error despite rigorous control of the staining technique. This could be overcome by using internal controls such as fibroblasts rather than external controls (rat hepatocytes) to determine the diploid DI with image analysis. A thorough understanding and appreciation of the methodological problems associated with image analysis and flow cytometric determination of DNA content is required before these methods find widespread clinical application. 
Exercise radionuclide angiocardiography predicts cardiac death in patients with coronary artery disease. The purpose of this investigation was to document the relative importance of three clinical and three radionuclide variables for prediction of cardiac death in a consecutive group of patients evaluated for coronary artery disease. During a 6 1/2-year period, beginning in January 1978, 2,042 consecutive patients underwent radionuclide angiocardiography, with a clinical diagnosis of coronary artery disease, at Duke University Medical Center. A subgroup of 318 patients who underwent surgical myocardial revascularization near the time of initial study were excluded from later analysis. Clinical follow-up information was complete in a group of 1,663 patients who did not undergo interventional therapy. The 141 cardiac deaths in these 1,663 patients were the study end point. Cox proportional hazards models analyzed the prognostic information contained in three clinical variables (pain type, age, and sex) and three radionuclide angiocardiogram variables (exercise ejection fraction, resting end-diastolic volume, and change in heart rate with exercise). One-variable models confirmed the prognostic importance of each of these six variables. A multivariable model in which all six variables were used showed clinical variables to contain only 5% and the radionuclide variables 95% of the prognostic information. The exercise ejection fraction was the single most important variable, which alone contained 85% of the total information in the model. Curves relating probability of no cardiac death to the exercise ejection fraction identified a value of 0.50 as an inflection point. Patients with exercise ejection fractions below 0.50 demonstrate a probability of cardiac death that increases as the ejection fraction decreases. 
Interferon therapy for acute posttransfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis: response with respect to anti-hepatitis C virus antibody status. To assess the effect of interferon therapy on posttransfusion non-A, non-B acute hepatitis, we examined the appearance of serum hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) and abnormal serum aminotransferase levels after the onset of hepatitis in 12 patients treated with interferon and in 46 patients treated conservatively. Eleven patients were given 3 million units of human fibroblast beta-interferon three times weekly for 4 wk and 1 was given one million units of human lymphoblastoid alpha-interferon daily for 3 months. In the interferon-treated patients, the effect of therapy on hepatic histology was also assessed. Detection of anti-HCV within 6 and 12 months after the onset of hepatitis was less common in interferon-treated patients than in control patients (6/12 vs 35/46 and 5/12 vs 35/46, both p = NS). At 24 months after the onset of hepatitis, anti-HCV levels were significantly lower in interferon-treated patients (0/10, p less than 0.05), but had not changed significantly in control patients (34/46). Abnormal serum aminotransferase levels at 6, 12, and 24 months after the onset of hepatitis were significantly less common in interferon-treated patients than in controls (25% vs 78.3%, p less than 0.005; 25% vs 71.7%, p less than 0.01; and 0% vs 67.4%, p less than 0.001). The percentage of abnormal serum aminotransferase levels at 6, 12, and 24 months after onset of hepatitis was also less in interferon-treated patients than in control patients, both among anti-HCV-positive patients (50% vs 85.7%, p = NS; 50% vs 80%, p = NS; and 0% vs 77.1%, p less than 0.01) and among anti-HCV-negative patients (0% vs 54.5%, p = NS; 0% vs 45.5%, p = NS; and 0% vs 27.3%, p = NS). Immediately after interferon therapy, the histological activity index dropped from 6.0 +/- 4.2 to 4.8 +/- 2.5 in anti-HCV-positive patients (p = NS) and from 4.2 +/- 4.3 to 2.6 +/- 1.7 in anti-HCV-negative patients (p = NS). Biopsy specimens obtained from four patients 12-23 months after interferon therapy revealed normal histology in one anti-HCV-positive patient and two anti-HCV-negative patients, and marked improvement in the other anti-HCV-positive patient. These results indicate that short-term, low-dose interferon therapy may be effective for posttransfusion non-A, non-B acute hepatitis (both anti-HCV-positive and anti-HCV-negative). 
Diagnosis and treatment of oral candidosis. Oral candidosis is a common opportunistic infection that manifests in a variety of forms. It is also recognized as one of the earliest manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although a number of antifungal agents are available for the treatment of this condition, a newly introduced triazole group of drugs appears to be highly effective in treating oral candidosis. This article reviews the clinical presentation and management of oral candidosis, particularly with reference to the latter group of drugs and HIV-induced disease. 
Experimental cardiac tamponade: a hemodynamic and Doppler echocardiographic reexamination of the relation of right and left heart ejection dynamics to the phase of respiration. A hallmark of cardiac tamponade is pulsus paradoxus. However, the exact mechanism of pulsus paradoxus and the relation of left and right ventricular ejection dynamics remain controversial, with some studies suggesting an inverse relation in ventricular filling and ejection and others citing a more important role for the effects of right heart ejection dynamics delayed by transit through the pulmonary artery bed. To specifically reexamine this issue, six sedated but spontaneously breathing dogs were studied during experimental cardiac tamponade with use of extensive hemodynamic instrumentation and Doppler methods. During cardiac tamponade, left ventricular systolic pressure decreased from 125.8 +/- 12.1 to 81.7 +/- 26.7 mm Hg (p less than 0.01) and cardiac output from 5.86 +/- 1.48 to 2.34 +/- 0.98 liters/min (p less than 0.001); mean pericardial pressure increased from -1.2 +/- 0.8 to 10.5 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and pulsus paradoxus from 4.3 +/- 1.6 to 10.7 +/- 1.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) compared with baseline values. An inverse relation in left and right ventricular ejection dynamics that was very close to 180 degrees out of phase was seen throughout the respiratory cycle in multiple hemodynamic and Doppler variables including peak systolic pressures, aortic and pulmonary flow velocities and ventricular ejection times. Simultaneous recording of the transmitral pressure gradient provided indirect evidence that the ventricular ejection dynamics were directly related to changes in ventricular filling. However, the magnitude of ventricular pressure or output flow velocity for each respiratory cycle was variable, depending on the exact timing of filling and ejection in relation to the phase of respiration. Variation in left ventricular output due to changes in right ventricular output delayed by transit through the pulmonary vasculature was not recognized in any animal. It is concluded that in spontaneously breathing dogs with acute cardiac tamponade, peak ventricular pressures, ventricular ejection times and pulmonary and aortic flow velocities have an inverse relation that is very close to 180 degrees out of phase. 
Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis with paralysis. Prognosis and treatment. In the interval between 1983 and 1988, 14 patients were treated for pyogenic spondylitis complicated by neurologic compromise. There were nine males and five females aged 39-80 years. The average time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 2.8 months. Predisposing factors were diabetes mellitus in four patients and urinary tract infections in five patients. The infection was blood borne in all 14 patients. In two patients, the infection was superimposed on a recent vertebral fracture. The cervical spine was involved in one patient; the thoracic spine in seven; and the lumbar spine in six patients. Six patients presented with a Frankel B paralysis, six with a Frankel C paralysis, and two with grade D paralysis. The neurologic symptoms lasted between one day and six weeks before surgery. Twelve patients had anterolateral decompression. Two of the 12 patients had a second stage posterior stabilization. Two patients were deemed inoperable. All surviving patients were managed by parenteral antibiotics for three to six weeks followed by enteral route for a total of three to six months. All 12 operated patients had a significant neurologic improvement (one grade or more on the Frankel scale) with solid interbody fusion. 
Cell kinetics of gastrointestinal tumors after different nutritional regimens. A preliminary report. Forty-four cases of different untreated gastrointestinal tumors were studied with regard to cell kinetic activity. As a pilot experiment, we also determined the 3H-TdR Labeling Index (LI) in 28 patients in basal conditions and after 15 days of nutritional manipulation with prevalently lipid-based or glucose-based feeding to ascertain whether selective nutritional regimens could affect tumor proliferation. Preliminary results from this study indicate that a kinetic perturbation is induced in tumor cells by nutritional manipulation. Lipid-based feeding seems to produce effects similar to those of chemical or physical anticancer agents, thus suggesting a possible supporting role of nutritional manipulation in cancer treatment strategy. 
Direct correlation of cytogenetic findings with cell morphology using in situ hybridization: an analysis of suspicious cells in bone marrow specimens of two patients completing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bone marrow cells from two pediatric patients completing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied using in situ hybridization with an alpha-satellite DNA probe specific for chromosome 17. Morphologic analysis of the end-therapy specimens from each patient had shown small numbers (7.5%, 8.5%) of cells that were suspicious for residual or recurrent disease. These cells could not be morphologically or immunophenotypically distinguished with certainty from immature lymphoid cells (hematogones), which may be present normally, sometimes in increased numbers, in the bone marrow specimens of children. In situ hybridization with a probe to chromosome 17 was used because the leukemic cells from each patient had originally been shown to have an extra copy of this chromosome. In one patient, in situ studies showed a population of cells (106 of 1,000 cells) with three hybridization signals indicating trisomy 17, and thus residual/recurrent leukemia. In the other patient trisomy 17 could not be detected. Additional hybridizations to previously stained bone marrow aspirate smears permitted a direct correlation of the cytogenetic findings with the suspicious cells on a cell-to-cell basis. The questionable cells were identified, photographed, and then re-examined after hybridization. In one patient, 13 of 18 (72%) of the suspicious cells were found to have trisomy 17, whereas in the other patient 0 of 24 (0%) demonstrated an extra copy of this chromosome. These cases illustrate a clinical application of interphase cytogenetic analysis and demonstrate how this technology can be used for direct correlation of cytogenetic findings with cell morphology. This technique should prove useful for the detection of minimal residual disease and for lineage studies in leukemia and myelodysplasia. 
Genesis of arrhythmias in the failing heart and therapeutic implications. Between 50 and 70% of patients with heart failure die suddenly and unexpectedly before they have deteriorated to New York Heart Association class IV symptoms. It has long been known that ventricular ectopy predicts sudden cardiac death in coronary heart disease, and this has also been shown in dilated cardiomyopathy. It is less certain whether antiarrhythmic drugs reduce this risk and improve prognosis. Supraventricular arrhythmias frequently develop in heart failure of all causes. They nearly always cause symptoms, and the establishment of atrial fibrillation may mark a permanent deterioration. Except for sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias are often occult. Hypokalemia and digitalis toxicity may have been precipitated by diuretics or interaction with antiarrhythmic drugs. In coronary heart failure, arrhythmias may be related to scar tissue or ischemia, which may also be responsible in dilated cardiomyopathy. Use of inotropes and inodilators may precipitate arrhythmias, whereas drugs that conserve energy or potassium, such as beta blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prevent them. Since suppression of ventricular arrhythmias has not been shown to prevent sudden death or prolong life in patients with heart failure, it may be that such arrhythmias do not directly presage ventricular fibrillation except in so far as they are markers of a poor prognosis with a risk of sudden death. If so, such arrhythmias are most likely to be suppressed by agents that result in improvement of left ventricular function and, through that, prolongation of life. 
Nutritional supplementation, psychosocial stimulation, and mental development of stunted children: the Jamaican Study. There is little unequivocal evidence that nutritional supplementation of undernourished children has a beneficial effect on their mental development. The effects of nutritional supplementation, with or without psychosocial stimulation, of growth-retarded (stunted) children aged 9-24 months were assessed in a study in Kingston, Jamaica. 129 children from poor neighbourhoods were randomly assigned to four groups--control, supplemented only, stimulated only, and supplemented plus stimulated. A group of matched non-stunted children (n = 32) was also included. The supplement comprised 1 kg milk-based formula per week for 2 years, and the stimulation weekly play sessions at home with a community health aide. The children's development (DQ) was assessed on the Griffiths mental development scales. Initially the stunted groups' DQs were lower than those of the non-stunted group, and those of the control group declined during the study, increasing their deficit. Stimulation and supplementation had significant independent beneficial effects on the children's development. Estimates of the supplementation effect ranged from 2.2 (95% confidence limits-1.4, 5.7) for the hand and eye subscale to 12.4 (5.4, 19.5) for the locomotor subscale and those for the stimulation effect from 6.4 (2.8, 10.0) for hand and eye to 10.3 (3.3, 17.3) for locomotor. The treatment effects were additive, and combined interventions were significantly more effective than either alone. These findings suggest that poor mental development in stunted children is at least partly attributable to undernutrition. 
Limitations of the electrocardiogram in estimating infarction size after acute reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of the 12-lead electrocardiogram to estimate infarction size after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN: The presence or absence of Q waves and the Selvester QRS score obtained before and after hospital discharge were compared with radionuclide estimates of infarction size and ejection fraction at discharge and 6 weeks later, regional wall motion at discharge and 6 weeks later, and myocardial perfusion defect size quantitated with Tc-99m-sestamibi at discharge. SETTING: A tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A consecutive series of 43 patients with acute myocardial infarction who received acute reperfusion therapy and were assessed using 12-lead electrocardiography, radionuclide angiography, and Tc-99m-sestamibi tomographic imaging before discharge. INTERVENTIONS: All 43 patients received acute reperfusion therapy: 21 patients received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, and 22 patients underwent primary percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The correlation of QRS score and Q waves with three radionuclide estimates of infarction size. RESULTS: A significant correlation was found between myocardial perfusion defect size at discharge and both left ventricular ejection fraction and regional wall motion at discharge and 6 weeks later (r = -0.71 to -0.81; all comparisons, P less than 0.001). Little correlation was found between electrocardiographic findings and radionuclide measurements of left ventricular function and perfusion. Presence or absence of Q waves at discharge was not associated with any difference in ejection fraction, regional wall motion, or perfusion defect at discharge. No correlation was found between QRS score and ejection fraction or myocardial perfusion defect size at discharge. The QRS score at discharge correlated only weakly with regional wall motion at discharge and 6 weeks later. This lack of correlation was unchanged when electrocardiograms obtained after hospital discharge were analyzed. CONCLUSION: Although inexpensive and readily available, the 12-lead electrocardiogram does not appear to provide a reliable estimate of infarction size after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. 
Beneficial effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity on myocardial stunning in dogs. This study was undertaken to elucidate whether alpha-1 adrenoceptor activity is beneficial to contractile dysfunction during reperfusion after a brief period of ischemia (stunned myocardium) in 54 open-chest dogs. Contractile dysfunction assessed by fractional shortening (FS) was observed 3 hours after the onset of reperfusion following 15 minutes of complete occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Pretreatment with prazosin (4 micrograms/kg/min i.c.) further deteriorated contractile dysfunction compared with the untreated condition (12.7 +/- 0.6% versus 6.9 +/- 0.4% with prazosin treatment, p less than 0.001). Conversely, alpha 1-adrenoceptor agonists, methoxamine (1.0 microgram/kg/min i.c.) and norepinephrine (0.24 microgram/kg/min i.c.) with rauwolscine and propranolol, significantly attenuated contractile dysfunction (FS in the methoxamine-treated group, 17.3 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.001 versus the untreated group; FS in the norepinephrine-treated group, 18.0 +/- 0.9%, p less than 0.05 versus 13.6 +/- 1.1% in the propranolol group). Both adenosine release and hyperemic coronary flow response during the early reperfusion period were significantly attenuated in the prazosin-treated group, and both were enhanced in the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. These results suggest that beneficial effects of alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity may be due to the enhanced release of adenosine. To test the cause-effect relation between the extent of adenosine release and contractile dysfunction during reperfusion, 8-phenyltheophylline was infused to block adenosine receptors in the methoxamine-treated group. The treatment with 8-phenyltheophylline completely abolished (FS, 7.4 +/- 0.3%) the beneficial effect of the enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation. Furthermore, in the prazosin-treated group, adenosine (9 micrograms/kg/min) was additionally infused into the left anterior descending coronary artery 5 minutes before and 2 hours after the onset of reperfusion. Both hyperemic coronary flow and contractile dysfunction (FS, 17.3 +/- 0.3%) recovered to the levels of the alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation groups. However, treatment with papaverine could not prevent deleterious effects of prazosin despite the fact that comparable hyperemic flow was obtained. Instead, lactate production up to 10 minutes after the onset of reperfusion was significantly larger (p less than 0.01) despite augmented contractile function in the prazosin-treated and the 8-phenyltheophylline with methoxamine-treated groups compared with the untreated group. The electron microscopic examination revealed no irreversible myocardial injury with and without pharmacological interventions. Thus, we conclude that alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity can reduce the magnitude of myocardial stunning and that its cellular mechanism is due to enhanced adenosine release by alpha 1-adrenoceptor activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Grafting of perfused adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease. Clinica Puerta de Hierro Neural Transplantation Group. The authors report results obtained in 20 severely affected patients with Parkinson's disease (Grade IV or V) who received an autotransplant of perfused adrenal medullary tissue. This study seems to indicate that these autoimplants can improve the parkinsonian symptomatology and induce amelioration in the patients' performance of routine activities. All the symptoms analyzed showed improvement, although it differed in intensity and time of onset. Moreover, this improvement was accompanied by a reduction in the daily intake of L-dopa, with discontinuance of dopamine agonists and amantadine. A number of medical complications were encountered, including three deaths, probably related to performing abdominal surgery in seriously affected parkinsonian patients who were unable to tolerate the discontinuance of their medication. The transient psychiatric disorders observed appeared to be related to the postoperative dose of L-dopa and/or anticholinergic agents administered, and diminished or disappeared when the doses were reduced. The reasons for improvement, which was bilateral, remain unknown, although one cause may be the surgical trauma (minicaudotomy) together with the implantation of adrenal medullary tissue, which may promote the sprouting of surviving dopaminergic fibers. Moreover, in this series, perfusion of adrenal medulla increased the capacity for revascularization of the tissue and may have reduced the damaging effects of warm ischemia on the cells. This, together with the existence of fenestrated vessels, could hypothetically have served as an access point for drugs, and if the implanted cells were viable, they might have served to store and manufacture different factors and/or transmitters. These results as well as those of other groups justify the development of a controlled international clinical trial. 
Isradipine: overall clinical experience in hypertension in the United States. Isradipine is a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist shown to be efficacious, safe, and well tolerated in the treatment of hypertension, regardless of patient age or race. There has been no evidence of negative inotropism, atrioventricular conduction delay, nor clinically significant changes in laboratory parameters associated with isradipine treatment. A total of 934 patients have been treated with isradipine in double-blind hypertension trials (involving 297 patients treated with placebo and 414 treated with active controls, such as hydrochlorothiazide and enalapril). Both the mean changes from baseline in diastolic and systolic blood pressures and the percentage of patients responding to treatment (blood pressure decrease of at least 10 mm Hg) were greater with isradipine than with placebo or active controls. Blood pressure response increases with increases in isradipine dose up to 10 to 15 mg daily; higher doses do not, on average, result in greater blood pressure reduction. The incidence of adverse reactions with isradipine is similar to that for active controls and slightly more than for placebo. There were fewer discontinuations with isradipine and, in addition, a decrease in the incidence of new adverse reactions with increasing duration of treatment, down to 1% at 24 months. 
Chronic neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Lyme disease, caused by the tick-borne spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, is associated with a wide variety of neurologic manifestations. To define further the chronic neurologic abnormalities of Lyme disease, we studied 27 patients (age range, 25 to 72 years) with previous signs of Lyme disease, current evidence of immunity to B. burgdorferi, and chronic neurologic symptoms with no other identifiable cause. Eight of the patients had been followed prospectively for 8 to 12 years after the onset of infection. RESULTS. Of the 27 patients, 24 (89 percent) had a mild encephalopathy that began 1 month to 14 years after the onset of the disease and was characterized by memory loss, mood changes, or sleep disturbance. Of the 24 patients, 14 had memory impairment on neuropsychological tests, and 18 had increased cerebrospinal fluid protein levels, evidence of intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi, or both. Nineteen of the 27 patients (70 percent) had polyneuropathy with radicular pain or distal paresthesias; all but two of these patients also had encephalopathy. In 16 patients electrophysiologic testing showed an axonal polyneuropathy. One patient had leukoencephalitis with asymmetric spastic diplegia, periventricular white-matter lesions, and intrathecal production of antibody to B. burgdorferi. Among the 27 patients, associated symptoms included fatigue (74 percent), headache (48 percent), arthritis (37 percent), and hearing loss (15 percent). At the time of examination, chronic neurologic abnormalities had been present from 3 months to 14 years, usually with little progression. Six months after a two-week course of intravenous ceftriaxone (2 g daily), 17 patients (63 percent) had improvement, 6 (22 percent) had improvement but then relapsed, and 4 (15 percent) had no change in their condition. CONCLUSIONS. Months to years after the initial infection with B. burgdorferi, patients with Lyme disease may have chronic encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, or less commonly, leukoencephalitis. These chronic neurologic abnormalities usually improve with antibiotic therapy. 
Menstrual cycle factors related to increased gastric contractile response to tube feeding. Evidence exists that the ovarian hormones have a modulating effect on gastrointestinal (GI) motility, yet details are sketchy and little attention has been paid to the effect that fluctuating hormone levels might have on women who are receiving enteral feedings. This study compared gastric motility indices in response to tube feedings at two points in the menstrual cycle, concurrently measured ovarian hormone levels, and described three potentially related factors (ie, GI symptoms, uterine cramping pain, reports of daily stressors). Intragastric motility responses to enteral feedings were obtained on 28 women (aged 19-37) during menses and midfollicular phases of two menstrual cycles. Intragastric pressure changes were monitored by an open-tipped cannula method at rest, during and after tube feeding (Ensure, 240 ml at 8 ml/min). Serum estradiol and progesterone levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Women completed a daily diary of symptoms and stressors throughout the two menstrual cycles. Results showed that intragastric pressure amplitudes and frequencies were higher at menses compared with midfollicular recordings. At menses, prefeeding and feeding gastric pressure amplitudes were positively correlated with uterine cramping pain and GI symptoms (ie, nausea). At menses, postfeeding contraction frequencies were also correlated with uterine cramping pain. At midfollicular phase, progesterone levels correlated with gastric motility indices; number of stressors indirectly correlated with gastric motility indices. These data suggest that gastric responses to enteral feeding are influenced by menstrual cycle phase. 
Nd:YAG laser-induced hyperthermia treatment of spontaneously occurring veterinary head and neck tumors. Conventional hyperthermia treatment of superficial tumors in the oral cavity is troublesome due to difficulty in accessing the lesion. A new hyperthermia technique employing near-infrared radiation delivered through a flexible silica optical fiber is described. The system consisted of an Nd:YAG laser for tissue heating, a He-Ne laser for aiming beam, a computer-controlled optical shutter, an interstitial thermometer, computer, and a printer. A 3-m-long 600-microns silica fiber delivered laser energy to the tumor via surface illumination. Using the aiming beam, the spot size was adjusted to include 5 mm of surrounding normal tissue. A thermocouple implanted in the tumor base provided temperature feedback to maintain desired hyperthermic temperature within the lesion. Three spontaneously occurring canine (two squamous cell carcinomas on the gum, one pigmented melanoma on the hard palate) and one feline tumor (squamous cell carcinoma on the nose) have been treated with Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia. Hyperthermia was delivered at 43.5 degrees C for 1 h. All animals received standard radiation treatment prior to hyperthermia. Nd:YAG laser hyperthermia allowed effective and efficient delivery of heat to veterinary nasal and oral lesions otherwise not treatable with conventional heating techniques. 
Pulmonary function tests in bronchopleural fistula. A 53-year-old white man underwent a left pneumonectomy for alveolar cell carcinoma. His postoperative course was complicated by pneumonia. At a follow-up clinic visit, the patient complained of a "roaring sound" during respiration. A follow-up PFT did not show the expected loss of volume (nitrogen washout) from a preoperative PFT, suggesting a bronchopleural fistula. A chest x-ray film and xenon lung scan confirmed the diagnosis. The fistula was surgically repaired. 
End-to-end repair of aortic coarctation using absorbable polydioxanone suture. Based on previous laboratory work, we have used polydioxanone absorbable suture in a variety of vascular and cardiac repairs in pediatric patients. However, some investigators have expressed concern about the potential for aneurysm formation at the anastomotic site. Between March 1983 and June 1989, 15 patients (7 male, 8 female) aged 2.5 months to 9.2 years (mean, 3.7 years) had resection of coarctation of the aorta and end-to-end anastomosis with polydioxanone absorbable suture. Thirteen patients have returned for routine postoperative evaluation, the follow-up time ranging from 11 to 49 months (mean, 23 months). Noninvasive two-dimensional, pulsed-wave Doppler and color echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated good anatomical repair and no anastomotic aneurysm formation or residual coarctation of the aorta in any patient after end-to-end anastomosis with polydioxanone. In summary, this intermediate follow-up study has revealed no vascular complications related to the repair of coarctation with absorbable polydioxanone suture. 
A life-threatening sexually transmitted Haemophilus influenzae in septic abortion: a case report. Haemophilus influenzae infections of the genitourinary tract are rare. A case of a life-threatening Haemophilus influenzae bacteremia associated with a septic abortion is presented. Sexual transmission of bacteria after orogenital contact is proposed as a possible source of this uncommon infection. 
Thoracic epidural analgesia in a patient with bilateral phaeochromocytoma undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A patient suffering from phaeochromocytoma and coronary artery stenoses needed coronary artery bypass grafting before adrenalectomy. High thoracic epidural analgesia (T1-T2) with bupivacaine and sufentanil in combination with general anaesthesia was used. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations decreased during the period before bypass grafting compared to the baseline value and no important haemodynamic changes were seen during this period. Thoracic epidural analgesia failed to suppress the release of catecholamine during the bypass period. After the operation, the plasma catecholamine concentrations returned to the baseline value. Excellent analgesia (visual analogue scale = 1-2) was achieved with a postoperative epidural, but the plasma catecholamine concentration increased considerably. 
Serum and tissue alpha-L-fucosidase activity in the pre-clinical and clinical stages of hepatocellular carcinoma. 1. To assess the value of serum alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) as a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, the activity was measured in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in control subjects. 2. Mean serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity was significantly greater in 35 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (225 +/- 69 nkat/l) than in 35 patients with cirrhosis and 20 normal subjects (134 +/- 30 and 93 +/- 28 nkat/l, respectively). The overlap between hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, however, was such as to severely limit any value of the enzyme as a diagnostic test. 3. In four cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, an increased enzyme activity was detectable in samples taken up to 66 months before the tumours were diagnosed clinically. 4. The serum activity of alpha-L-fucosidase fell to within the reference range after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma in three patients and in one of these a subsequent rise was associated with tumour recurrence which was diagnosed at 8 months after the rise in activity. Ineffective cytotoxic chemotherapy was also associated with a progressive rise in serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity. 5. alpha-L-fucosidase activity in tumour tissue was significantly lower than that seen in non-tumour tissue from cirrhotic patients. These reductions may represent increased transport from the tissue and may partly account for the increased serum activity found in some patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Generalized pustular psoriasis. A review of 63 cases. BACKGROUND--Sixty-three patients with generalized pustular psoriasis were hospitalized during a 29-year period. They were classified into four subgroups on the basis of onset and morphologic pattern of disease: acute (von Zumbusch), subacute annular, chronic (acral), and mixed. This division provides a better understanding of the variability of the disease and helps in choosing treatment. OBSERVATIONS--The average age at onset was 50 years; male and female patients were affected about equally. In 11 patients, flares were precipitated by localized infections. Approximately one fourth of the patients had complications; most were superinfections. The average stay in the hospital was 30 days; factors correlating with a long hospitalization were hypocalcemia, female sex, and a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris or pustular psoriasis. CONCLUSIONS--Whereas topical therapy was helpful, systemic medications were often needed. Coal tar, ultraviolet light, and psoralen-ultraviolet A may be effective; however, they must be used with caution, because they may exacerbate the disease. 
Cardiovascular reflexes and autonomic dysfunction in Parkinson's disease. Cardiovascular reflexes were analysed in a group of 20 patients suffering from Parkinson's disease and in 12 age-matched healthy subjects, in order to ascertain the incidence and degree of autonomic dysfunction. The following were measured: heart rate variation during normal breathing, postural change (30/15 ratio) and during the Valsalva manoeuvre: blood pressure variation after standing. These measurements were taken at least 12 h after therapy had been withdrawn and were repeated after therapy had been resumed. Significant changes in the different heart rate variation indices were found in the parkinsonian patients which correlated with the duration and severity of the extrapyramidal symptomatology. After standing the patients showed a significant drop in blood pressure, when compared respectively with their base values and with the response in controls. Anticholinergic drugs had no significant effect on the heart rate variation indices, whereas antiparkinsonian therapy seems to have contributed to the drop in blood pressure after standing. 
Transformation suppressor activity of a Jun transcription factor lacking its activation domain. The oncoprotein c-Jun is thought to be a mediator of ras transformation as both its synthesis and activity as a transcription factor are stimulated by ras expression. But c-Jun co-operates with ras in transformation assays, suggesting that they act along different pathways (reviewed in ref. 4). Here we show by means of a dominant-negative mutated transcription factor that c-Jun potentially in conjunction with other factors that interact with it is necessary for transformation by ras. The mutant Jun lacks an activation domain and blocks stimulation of transcription by several oncoproteins, including Ras, v-Src, polyoma middle T, c-Jun and c-Fos, as well as by the tumour promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The inhibition is specific for motifs that bind Jun: activation of an NF-kappa B/Rel motif is not affected. This Jun mutant acts as an anti-oncogene in ras-transformed cells, generating non-transformed revertants that have acquired anchorage and density-dependent growth, as well as reduced tumorigenicity in vivo. Mutants of other transcription factors designed to inhibit transformation will enable us to study their role in signal transduction. 
Plasticity of central motor pathways in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. To obtain neurophysiologic evidence for a reorganization of central motor pathways in children who had suffered a cerebral lesion at birth, we performed cross-correlation analyses of multiunit EMG recordings obtained from children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy and marked mirror movements. We found that the motoneuron pools of homologous left and right hand muscles received common synaptic input from abnormally branched presynaptic axons. The results of electromagnetic brain stimulation, cutaneomuscular, and tendon reflex testing suggested that these common inputs are provided by abnormally branched corticospinal tract fibers whose origin is the undamaged motor cortex. 
Complex segregation analysis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma in Chinese families: interaction of inherited susceptibility and hepatitis B viral infection. Primary hepatocellular carcinoma (PHC) is extremely common in eastern China, where it is both associated with chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and often familial. Complex segregation analysis of 490 extended families was undertaken with liability classes defined by age, sex, and HBV infection status. The maximum-likelihood model suggests that a recessive allele with population frequency approximately .25 yields lifetime risk of PHC, in the presence of both HBV infection and genetic susceptibility, of .84 for males and .46 for females. The model further predicts that, in the absence of genetic susceptibility, lifetime risk of PHC is .09 for HBV-infected males and .01 for HBV-infected females and that, regardless of genotype, it is virtually zero for uninfected persons. Complex segregation analysis therefore provides evidence for the interaction of genotype, environmental exposure, sex and age in determining the occurrence of PHC in this population. 
Biomagnetic localization of ventricular arrhythmias. The magnetic fields caused by electrical activity of the human heart can be coherently measured with a highly sensitive, multichannel, superconducting quantum interference-device system and can enable noninvasive localization of the underlying electrical activity. The magnetocardiograms (MCGs) of 10 patients with spontaneous premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), three patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), and four healthy subjects with induced paced beats were recorded for 2-15 minutes. After correction for superimposed repolarization activity, the site of origin of the arrhythmias was localized from the magnetic field distribution at the onset of the ectopic beats. The localization results of paced beats showed an error of a few millimeters in relation to the position of the catheter tip. The results of spontaneous PVC and VT were confirmed with endocardial mapping or associated with ischemic lesions. The authors conclude that multichannel magnetocardiographic studies enable the completely noninvasive localization of ventricular arrhythmias. 
Intraperitoneal contrast material improves the CT detection of peritoneal metastases. The preoperative detection of peritoneal metastases from gynecologic malignancies is difficult; in particular, CT often fails to detect peritoneal implants. This study was designed to determine if the administration of intraperitoneal iodinated contrast media would increase the CT detection of such peritoneal metastases. Prospectively, both standard and intraperitoneal contrast-enhanced CT studies of the abdomen and pelvis were performed in 16 patients with suspected gynecologic tumors. All patients then underwent operative staging, with the location and number of metastases documented. The intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies were more sensitive in the detection of peritoneal metastases than standard CT examinations. Whereas routine CT detected peritoneal metastases in seven (64%) of 11 patients with surgically proved implants, the intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies detected peritoneal metastases in all 11 patients. Depending on the specific intraperitoneal compartments involved, the sensitivity of intraperitoneal enhanced CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases was two- to fourfold greater than that of standard CT examinations. Our results suggest that intraperitoneal enhanced CT is superior to standard CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases. 
Abscesses of the neck in infants and young children. A review of 112 cases. A review of 112 patients 5 years of age and younger with cervical abscesses is reported. Staphylococcus aureus and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus were cultured most often: in 39% and 17% of patients, respectively. Sixteen patients (14%) had unusual abscesses such as infected congenital cysts, cat-scratch disease, or myocobacterial abscesses. One patient had a necrotizing infection with group A streptococci and anaerobic streptococci. Intravenous antibiotic therapy was used in 104 patients, with 94% of these patients receiving a penicillin derivative, usually an antistaphylococcal penicillin. Ninety-six percent of the patients had incision and drainage of their abscesses; 8 patients required more than one incision and drainage. Two patients required airway intervention, 1 by intubation and 1 by trachetomy. Most pediatric cervical abscesses respond well to appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy and incision and drainage. 
Effects of EAP follow-up on prevention of relapse among substance abuse clients. Clients entering an employee assistance program (EAP) of a large manufacturing plant in 1985 who were assessed as having an alcohol or drug abuse problem (N = 325) were randomized into an experimental "special follow-up" group and a control "regular care" group. The regular care group received follow-up only as needed (following the usual practice of the EAP), while a follow-up counselor was hired to make routine contacts with the special follow-up group. Study intake continued through 1985, and follow-up continued through the end of 1986. Data collected on study subjects included EAP participation data, absenteeism, number of hospitalizations, health care claims paid and disability claims paid. The major study hypothesis was that EAP clients randomly allocated to special follow-up would show better results than regular care clients (i.e., would have fewer relapses, better job attendance and lower health benefit utilization during the follow-up year). The follow-up intervention was incompletely implemented due to a variety of organizational problems. Differences between the two groups on the six outcome measures were not statistically significant, although clients in the special follow-up group did show better results than clients in the regular care group on the three measures related to substance abuse. Differences on these three measures were marginally significant in regression analyses after controlling for the effects of number of follow-up visits, age, race and chronicity. 
Naloxone-sensitive, pregnancy-induced changes in behavioral responses to colorectal distention: pregnancy-induced analgesia to visceral stimulation. This study examined the feasibility of using colorectal distention as a noxious visceral stimulus in rat pregnancy-induced analgesia studies as well as the influence of naloxone on the pregnancy-induced changes in the behavioral response to a noxious visceral stimulus. In the first part of the study, we compared the effects of pregnancy on several forms of noxious stimulation (colorectal distention, hypertonic saline induced writhing, tail flick, and hot plate). After determination of prepregnant baseline values, one group of rats (n = 35) was mated and retested on days 7 and 21 of gestation and 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days after parturition. After baseline determinations on day 21 and postpartum day 1, the animals received a subcutaneous injection of naloxone 1.0 mg/kg and were retested. A nonpregnant control group of animals (n = 7) was tested in the same manner. On day 21 of gestation and postpartum days 1 and 3, significant changes (higher threshold or longer latency to response) were observed after all but the writhing test. High-dose naloxone (1.0 mg/kg) significantly reduced the increases observed on day 21 and post-partum day 1. Nonpregnant rats demonstrated no significant change on any test day. The second part of the study evaluated a possible influence of low-dose naloxone on pregnancy-induced analgesia to visceral stimulation (colorectal distention) in another group of pregnant rats (n = 44). The significant increase in threshold on day 21 of gestation was not changed by intravenous (i.v.) naloxone 1.0, 2.3, or 3.0 micrograms/kg, whereas 5.0 and 20.0 micrograms/kg naloxone significantly decreased the observed pregnancy-induced analgesia. 
Treatment of acute myeloid leukaemia in a renal allograft recipient: implications of cyclosporin immunosuppressive treatment. The clinical effects of cyclosporin were evaluated during cytotoxic treatment in a 61 year old man with acute myeloid leukaemia. He had required a renal transplant 18 months before presenting with acute myeloid leukaemia (FAB subtype M4). He had received cyclosporin 3.5-4.0 mg/kg daily to maintain a plasma cyclosporin concentration of 75-150 ng/ml. Cyclosporin was continued during induction chemotherapy with daunorubicin, cytarabine, and 6-thioguanine (DAT). He had fever and oropharyngeal candidiasis that was unresponsive to anti-bacterial drugs but responsive to systemic amphotericin. Bone marrow examination 14 days after chemotherapy showed complete haematological remission. Subsequently he tolerated consolidation treatment with DAT with no serious complications. Unfortunately he developed fatal septicaemia following a second consolidation with mitozantrone and cytarabine. Inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity by cyclosporin may not significantly increase the toxicity of aggressive chemotherapeutic regimens, and as benefit may be achieved by this approach further clinical evaluation is justified. 
Renal transplant arterial thrombosis: association with cyclosporine. Of 136 patients who received a renal transplant between January 1984 and August 1988, there were six cases (4.4%) of allograft arterial thrombosis (AAT) occurring a mean of 23 days after transplantation. All were maintained on cyclosporine A(CsA) in addition to prednisone and azathioprine. All transplants were performed by the same transplant surgeon. Five of the six episodes (83%) were in allografts that had multiple renal arteries (MRA), giving an incidence of AAT in that group of 36%. Only one of 122 (0.8%) allografts with a single renal artery experienced thrombosis. CsA was started a mean of 9 days after transplantation (range, 16 to 33 days). There was no correlation of AAT to CsA levels. AAT appears to be an early complication of allografts with MRA in patients maintained on CsA. 
Phase I-II study of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with recombinant human interferon gamma. The association of immunodeficiency with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has generated the concept of supplying immunologically active agents as a means of treating these cancers. One of the most active immunologic messengers is interferon gamma, which has been observed in our laboratories to also have a direct cytotoxic effect on cultures of squamous cell carcinoma derived from the head and neck. To test the feasibility of treating patients with advanced but resectable head and neck cancer with this agent, we designed a phase I-II trial of recombinant human interferon gamma using a 24-hour infusion repeated weekly for four times. In this study, both tumor and immunologic parameters were studied before and after treatment. Eight patients were entered into the study with the highest recombinant human interferon gamma dose attempted being 0.25 mg/m2 per 24 hours. Minimal side effects were observed. Three patients had clinically measurable responses, four had stabilization of disease, and one had progression while receiving treatment. Histopathologic results of treatment were similar to in vitro observations. Necrosis, as well as differentiation of tumor cells, was observed. In some tumors there was a marked decrease in cellularity without a change in tumor volume due to increased extracellular keratin deposition. Our study indicates that evaluation of adoptive immunotherapy trials in head and neck cancer needs to include parameters other than simple tumor regression as an end point, otherwise therapeutically important lymphokine-induced changes may be missed. Further evaluation of recombinant human interferon gamma and agents that induce human interferon gamma are warranted. 
Incremental prognostic accuracy of clinical, radionuclide and hemodynamic data in acute myocardial infarction. A logical sequence of testing in evaluating prognosis early in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) would be to use clinical data first, then add noninvasive data and finally add invasive data. The incremental prognostic information concerning 1-year survival obtained from such a sequence in 107 patients with AMI was studied using logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curves. Cardiac mortality was 24% at 1 year. Clinical data obtained soon after admission (prior myocardial infarction, heart rate, blood pressure, age) were 78 +/- 5% accurate in the prediction of 1-year survival. The addition of radionuclide-estimated left ventricular ejection fraction or invasive hemodynamic data to the clinical model at this time improved prognostic accuracy to 84 +/- 5% (p = 0.05) and 87 +/- 4% (p = 0.007), respectively. The further addition of invasive data to the model containing clinical and left ventricular ejection fraction data provided a further increment in prognostic accuracy to 89 +/- 4%, whereas no significant increase in accuracy was seen on addition of left ventricular ejection fraction to the model containing clinical and invasive data. It is concluded that clinical data provide important prognostic information concerning late survival early in the course of AMI. This may be improved by the logical application of noninvasive and invasive studies at this time. 
Dietary manipulation of methotrexate-induced enterocolitis. Administration of chemotherapy is limited by host toxicity, which is often manifested by severe enterocolitis. This study evaluated the effects of a liquid, elemental, chemically defined diet (ED) supplemented with 2% glutamine (Glu-ED) compared with a polypeptide diet (PPD) on the morbidity and mortality after methotrexate (MTX) administration. Fischer 344 rats (n = 80) were fed either a regular rat chow diet (RD), a 2% glycine supplemented elemental diet (Gly-ED), a 2% glutamine-supplemented elemental diet (GLU-ED), and a glycine-supplemented polypeptide diet(Gly-PPD) for 7 days prior to administration of MTX (20 mg/kg, ip). After 72 hours, eight rats per group were killed; portal vein and vena cava blood, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), liver, small intestine, and cecum were sampled for bacterial culture. Remaining animals were followed to calculate survival. One hundred percent of the Gly-PPD and 25% of the Glu-ED animals survived compared with 0% of the Gly-ED animals. Our data showed that ED resulted in an increased quantity of intestinal Gram-negative bacteria and diminished intestinal mucosal height and mucosal DNA/protein content. The polypeptide diet prevented intestinal mucosal atrophy, avoided MTX-induced enterocolitis and significantly improved animal survival compared with an elemental diet with or without glutamine supplementation. 
Contribution of regional vascular responses to whole body autoregulation in conscious areflexic rats. We designed studies to evaluate the autoregulation response during volume expansion in three major circulation regions (intestine, kidney, and hind limb) during simultaneous determination of whole body autoregulation in conscious areflexic rats. Cardiac output was measured with chronically implanted electromagnetic flow probes on the ascending aorta. Regional blood flow velocity was measured with pulsed Doppler flow probes on the superior mesenteric (n = 7), left renal (n = 7), and right iliac (n = 7) arteries. Doppler flow probes were calibrated in situ in each rat to determine regional blood flow values. Neurohumoral reflex control of pressure was removed pharmacologically, and blood pressure and cardiac output were returned to resting control values with intravenous norepinephrine infusion, which was maintained at that constant level throughout the study. Hemodynamic changes were measured in response to blood volume expansion with infusion of 0.9 ml blood over 6 minutes. This small change in blood volume resulted in significant increases in vascular resistance of 15% in the whole body, 8% in the intestine, 18% in the kidney, and 15% in the hind limb. The pressure-flow slope, used as an index of autoregulation (slope = 0, perfect autoregulation; slope = 1, rigid vasculature), averaged 0.34 in the whole body, 0.52 in the intestine, 0.19 in the kidney, and 0.39 in the hind limb. When compared with the whole body, blood flow autoregulation was less in the intestine, greater in the kidney, and the same in the hind limb. 
MRI in cerebral toxocaral disease. Toxocara canis, the common roundworm in the dog, can cause "visceral larva migrans" syndrome in humans, which may include generalised illness, eosinophilia, and symptoms arising from larval invasion of different organs. Of these, the clinically most important are liver, lungs, eyes and CNS. Involvement of the different parts of the CNS in human toxocaral disease has been described, but not the CT or MRI appearances of the cerebral lesions. In one case with a single focal epileptic fit, CT was described as normal. In the Toxocara canis case described, the cerebral lesions on MRI, before and after therapy, are shown. 
Treatment of hypertensive urgencies with oral nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril. Sixty-five patients with uncomplicated hypertensive urgencies were treated in the emergency and cardiology departments with 20 mg nifedipine, 20 mg nicardipine, or 25 mg captopril in a randomized study. The study population consisted of 65 patients ranging in age from forty-one to seventy-one. Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed for six hours after intake of the antihypertensive agents. Within sixty minutes nifedipine reduced blood pressure by an average of 74.7 mmHg for the systolic and 35.4 mmHg for the diastolic. Average heart rate increased significantly by 11.6 beats/min at within thirty minutes. Nicardipine and captopril produced equivalent falls in systolic (-81.6 and -79.4 mmHg) and diastolic (-37.3 and -33 mmHg) blood pressure respectively, but did not increase heart rate significantly. The antihypertensive effect of each drug was maintained until six hours after medication. In conclusion, nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril show similar efficacy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies. The authors believe that these drugs can be used as first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies safely and effectively. 
Emergency department stabilization of pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis. Current advances. The infant or child who presents to the Emergency Department with bacterial meningitis may have nonspecific vague symptoms with few signs of serious illness. However, the disease is often rapidly progressive and life-threatening, and may be associated with respiratory failure, circulatory failure, increased intracranial pressure, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or convulsions, any of which may lead to a fatal outcome. It is important for the triage technician in an Emergency Department to cautiously inspect each young patient who presents with illness, carefully considering whether the presenting syndrome of symptoms and signs might be consistent with early meningitis. If the young patient is triaged in a nonemergent category, then periodic assessments of the patients waiting to be seen may ensure that, when the infant or child with an obscure presentation develops evidence suggesting this diagnosis, the triage technician will promptly notify the appropriate definitive care providers who assume responsibility for immediate definitive evaluation and stabilization. Changes in delivery of lifesaving care to the life-threatened child are being impacted by current advances in the understanding of the biochemical basis of disease at the cellular and subcellular levels. Endotoxin release into the blood causes increased production of kinins, which results in vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability. Members of the leukotriene family may also enhance vascular permeability as well as produce augmented leukocyte aggregation to vascular endothelium, vasoconstriction, and bronchoconstriction. Endotoxin activates the complement cascade and induces platelets to form reversible aggregates that may be trapped in the pulmonary microcirculation; and endotoxemia-activated platelets release serotonin, which may be associated with pulmonary hypertension. Now that we have antibiotics that are effective against organisms whose degradation produces endotoxin, there is interest in lessening the host inflammatory response to endotoxin through use of dexamethasone as an anti-inflammatory agent. Clinical trials have revealed that patients who received dexamethasone became afebrile earlier and were less likely to acquire deafness after bacterial meningitis. Because administration of antibiotics is the current specific medical therapy for this life-threatening microbial invasion, it is reasonable to continue to strive to shorten the interval between recognition of disease and specific therapy. However, new studies suggest that consequences of the complex host inflammatory response (at the cellular and subcellular level) to microbial invasion and endotoxin release from bacterial degradation are increasingly important in determining survival or severity of morbidity. Therapeutic intervention with specific antibiotics and steroid anti-inflammatory agents for modulating host responses enhances outcome. 
A short plasma exchange protocol is effective in severe myasthenia gravis. Plasma exchange has been reported to be a successful therapeutic procedure for the treatment of severely compromised myasthenic patients, but the optimal regimen in terms of costs or clinical benefit has not so far been determined. We have investigated the efficacy of a short plasmapheresis protocol of two exchanges 1 day apart in a series of 70 patients with severe forms of myasthenia gravis. Patients were evaluated before and 7 days after the first exchange. A positive outcome was observed in 70% of the plasma exchange cycles performed. Disease severity did not seem to be a negative prognostic factor for the efficacy of this short protocol, which was well tolerated by patients. In only 1 case were major side-effects observed. In spite of its short duration, the exchange treatment plus concomitant immunosuppressive drug therapy was not followed by early clinical deterioration. 
Visceral leishmaniasis: a difficult diagnosis and unusual causative agent. In a young man who had a prolonged fever of unknown origin, hepatosplenomegaly, and progressive pancytopenia, stained smears, blood-agar cultures of bone marrow, and serologic testing for antileishmanial antibodies were negative. Biopsies from liver and bone marrow were uninformative. Visceral leishmaniasis was diagnosed only after splenectomy, when amastigotes were finally cultured from the spleen. The parasite was shown to be an unusual leishmanial parasite, possessing a mixture of intrinsic biochemical and serologic characteristics displayed independently by Leishmania tropica and Leishmania donovani sensu lato, the latter being the usual cause of visceral leishmaniasis. After splenectomy, parasites were also demonstrated in stained bone marrow aspirate smears. Recovery was uneventful after treatment with antimony for 28 days. Visceral leishmaniasis can be a cause of fever of unknown origin and should be considered in its differential diagnosis in endemic areas. 
Ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Ultrasonography with graded compression was performed in 525 patients with clinical signs of acute appendicitis. Of 207 patients with surgically proven appendicitis the inflamed appendix (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) had been visualized sonographically in 177 (86 per cent). The score for non-perforated appendicitis (91 per cent) was higher than for perforated appendicitis (55 per cent). Twenty-four patients in whom an inflamed appendix was seen on ultrasonography did not undergo surgery because of rapidly subsiding symptoms ('abortive appendicitis'). Four of these 24 developed recurrent appendicitis warranting surgery. Two underwent elective appendectomy and 18 have remained symptom-free. Of 155 patients with a subsequently confirmed alternative condition, ultrasonography made the correct diagnosis in 140: bacterial ileocaecitis (69), mesenteric lymphadenitis (eight), gynaecological conditions (34), urological conditions (eight), caecal diverticulitis (six), perforated peptic ulcer (six), Crohn's disease (two) and miscellaneous conditions (seven). Of 139 patients in whom no definite diagnosis was made ultrasonography showed no abnormalities in 138. In four patients a false positive sonographic diagnosis of appendicitis was made and in two patients with appendicitis an alternative condition was incorrectly diagnosed. During the last 3 years of the study the negative appendicectomy rate was 7 per cent and delay beyond 6 h after admission occurred in only 2 per cent of patients with surgically proven appendicitis. When used to complement the clinical diagnosis ultrasonography improves the diagnostic accuracy and patient management in those suspected of having acute appendicitis. 
Proportionate mortality trends: 1950 through 1986 Mortality trends in the United States from 1950 through 1986 were analyzed for the conditions that are or have recently been among the six leading causes of death. The age-adjusted mortality rate for all causes has decreased from 841.5 to 541.7 per 100,000 population. Cause-specific, age-adjusted mortality rates have declined from 1950 through 1986 for cerebrovascular disease, injuries, perinatal conditions, heart disease, and influenza and pneumonia. Time trends in the proportion of persons dying of each of these diseases, however, have varied; the proportion dying of cerebrovascular disease, injuries, and perinatal conditions has decreased, and the proportion of persons dying of heart disease and influenza and pneumonia has remained fairly stable from 1950 through 1986. During this same time, age-adjusted death rates have increased for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and have remained fairly stable for malignant neoplasms, while the proportions of persons dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and malignant neoplasms have increased dramatically. For people aged 35 to 64 years, malignant neoplasms have now overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death. For those aged 65 years and older, heart disease remains the leading cause of death, accounting for almost 50% of all deaths in persons 85 years and older. 
Postsepsis bradycardia in children with leukemia. OBJECTIVE: We observed sinus bradycardia in a small number of children with hematologic malignancies who were recovering from sepsis. Our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A pediatric ICU in a children's oncology hospital. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the ICU over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. Six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. All patients had positive blood cultures (Streptococcus mitis, n = 4; Escherichia coli, n = 2; and Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). All seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. Neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. No therapy was given for the bradycardia. Echocardiograms and ECGs were normal in all patients, except for the presence of bradycardia. Bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. After that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. Prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. As the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated. 
The use of an intraluminal shunt for bypass grafts of the cavernous internal carotid artery. Technical note. The authors describe an indwelling intraluminal shunt for use during graft bypass procedures of the cavernous internal carotid artery. The clinical use of this shunt in a patient with meningioma invading the right cavernous sinus is described. This shunt has also been found applicable during carotid endarterectomy, and should prove to be a useful addition to the neurosurgical armamentarium for skull-base surgery. 
Exaggerated and prolonged thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) test responses in tertiary hypothyroidism. A 60 year old man with panhypopituitarism due to a large meningioma and prolonged and exaggerated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) responses is described. Initial investigations showed a subnormal urinary free cortisol concentration, a low serum cortisol taken at 0900 hours, and a low free T4 concentration. The TSH was towards the upper end of the normal range. Subsequently pituitary function tests showed subnormal production of luteinising hormone in response to luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) and a short synacthen test with a low 30 minute cortisol value. Long synacthen testing showed a normal response at four days, confirming that the abnormalities were due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. A computed tomogram showed a large meningioma compressing the hypothalamus, pituitary, and temporal lobe. TRH testing showed a prolonged and exaggerated response, consistent with tertiary hypothyroidism. 
High energy neutron treatment for pelvic cancers: study stopped because of increased mortality. OBJECTIVE--To compare high energy fast neutron treatment with conventional megavoltage x ray treatment in the management of locally advanced pelvic carcinomas (of the cervix, bladder, prostate, and rectum). DESIGN--Randomised study from February 1986; randomisation to neutron treatment or photon treatment was unstratified and in the ratio of 3 to 1 until January 1988, when randomisation was in the ratio 1 to 1 and stratified by site of tumour. SETTING--Mersey regional radiotherapy centre at Clatterbridge Hospital, Wirral. PATIENTS--151 patients with locally advanced, non-metastatic pelvic cancer (27 cervical, 69 of the bladder, seven prostatic, and 48 of the rectum). INTERVENTION--Randomisation to neutron treatment was stopped in February 1990. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Patient survival and causes of death in relation to the development of metastatic disease and treatment related morbidity. RESULTS--In the first phase of the trial 42 patients were randomised to neutron treatment and 14 to photon treatment, and in the second phase 48 to neutron treatment and 47 to photon treatment. The relative risk of mortality for photons compared with neutrons was 0.66 (95% confidence interval 0.40 to 1.10) after adjustment for site of tumour and other important prognostic factors. Short term and long term complications were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS--The trial was stopped because of the increased mortality in patients with cancer of the cervix, bladder, or rectum treated with neutrons. 
Cardiovascular evaluation in blunt thoracic trauma using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Blunt chest trauma can result in significant cardiothoracic injury, which can include cardiac contusion, aortic injury, and myocardial valvular injury. Nineteen patients with no prior history of cardiac abnormalities who sustained severe blunt chest trauma and had widening of the mediastinum on chest radiographs were prospectively evaluated using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). In each instance TEE was performed without difficulty, excellent images were obtained of the aorta and heart, and no complications were noted. Abnormalities were seen in 12 (63%) patients, with hypokinetic regional wall motion consistent with cardiac contusion demonstrated in five (26%) patients. Tricuspid regurgitation was found in three (16%) patients, and aortic and mitral regurgitation in one (5%) patient each. Aortic wall hematomas were seen in two patients, one of whom had an intimal tear on aortography, and a pericardial effusion was seen in one patient with an aortic intimal tear confirmed angiographically. Thus TEE can be performed safely in the acute setting of patients sustaining severe blunt chest trauma and yield useful information with respect to cardiovascular function and the aorta. 
Treatment of voiding complaints and incontinence in painful bladder syndrome. The treatment of voiding complaints and incontinence in painful bladder syndrome requires careful attention to detail. As the exact nature of these conditions is unknown, no single modality is effective, and multiple treatments may be required. A sympathetic and supportive physician is necessary in all these cases. 
Listeriosis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Although resistance to Listeria monocytogenes infection requires intact T cell-mediated immunity, only 20 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and listeriosis (including one patient described herein) have been reported to date. Listeriosis developed before AIDS in five cases. Syndromes included meningitis in nine cases, bacteremia in nine, brain abscess in one, and endocarditis in one. Eighteen patients were treated with ampicillin, penicillin, or amoxicillin with or without aminoglycosides. Clinical and microbiologic responses were obtained in one patient with bacteremia treated with vancomycin and in one patient with meningitis treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Three of the nine patients with meningitis died, as did the patient with brain abscess. All nine patients with bacteremia and the patient with endocarditis survived. No case of relapse was documented. L. monocytogenes, although uncommon, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of febrile illness, meningitis, and brain abscess in patients with HIV infection. 
Management of hypertensive crises. The availability of potent antihypertensive drugs that will decrease markedly elevated blood pressure within minutes to hours has changed the concepts of definition and therapy of hypertensive emergencies and urgencies. Intravenous infusion of sodium nitroprusside can be used in the truly emergent situation and is effective, reliable, and safe. While oral therapy is more convenient, it is not as consistently effective as parenteral administration and can lead to excessive reductions in blood pressure that are more difficult to manage than when short-acting agents are given intravenously. 
Postmortem studies of the heart in three fatal cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hearts of individuals who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan, with particular attention paid to the coronary arteries, the neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart because of reported terminal disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management. 
The use of an intraluminal shunt for bypass grafts of the cavernous internal carotid artery. Technical note. The authors describe an indwelling intraluminal shunt for use during graft bypass procedures of the cavernous internal carotid artery. The clinical use of this shunt in a patient with meningioma invading the right cavernous sinus is described. This shunt has also been found applicable during carotid endarterectomy, and should prove to be a useful addition to the neurosurgical armamentarium for skull-base surgery. 
Contemporary management of neurofibromatosis. The neurofibromatoses are two distinct entities with different genetic origins. The phenotypic expressions and required treatments are different. The devastating nature of neurofibromatosis-2 may be more effectively controlled through the application of advanced imaging techniques and contemporary neurotologic procedures. The most common manifestation of neurofibromatosis-2 is that of bilateral acoustic neuromas. The eventual total bilateral sensorineural deafness associated with this condition can be obviated in selected cases if the diagnosis is established early. Follow-up data are reported for three patients in whom hearing was preserved in at least one ear. When removal with hearing preservation is not possible, subtotal tumor removal with decompression of the internal auditory canals may delay progression of hearing loss. A new approach to tumors of the pterygomaxillary fossa that have extended to the middle cranial fossa has been successfully applied and is described. 
Sex cord tumor with annular tubules associated with endometriosis of the fallopian tube. Sex cord tumor with annular tubules (SCTAT) is a distinctive ovarian sex cord-stromal tumor. The authors describe a case of SCTAT arising outside the ovaries, in the fallopian tube. The authors are aware of only one other case of extra-ovarian SCTAT, in an umbilical hernia sac in an adult woman. The case reported was an incidental finding in a hysterectomy specimen, obtained because of carcinoma in situ of the uterine cervix in a 32-year-old woman. The patient is alive and disease-free two years after surgery. The 1-cm tumor in the right fallopian tube was composed of typical ring-shaped tubules encircling hyalinized basement membrane-like material. In addition, glands and stroma of endometriosis were intimately admixed with the nests of tumor. The implications of these findings for the origin of SCTAT and ovarian sex cord structures are discussed. 
Clinical features and circulating gonadotropin, insulin, and androgen interactions in women with polycystic ovarian disease. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the interactions of hyperinsulinemia and inappropriate gonadotropin secretion in women with polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). DESIGN: Comparative study of endocrinologic parameters in subjects with PCOD. SETTING: Open patient clinic of reproductive endocrinology at University Central Hospital of Turku, Finland. PATIENTS: Fourteen nonobese and 10 obese patients with PCOD. Seven healthy women for reference data collection. Normal thyroid function, serum prolactin concentration, normal diurnal cortisol variation, euglycemia in all subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum concentrations of insulin, testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, sex hormone-binding globulin, immunoreactive luteinizing hormone (LH), bioactive LH, and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). RESULTS: The concentration of insulin was higher and that of bioactive LH was lower in obese than in nonobese PCOD women in whom the levels were also above the upper reference value. There was a negative correlation between insulin and bioactive LH levels (r = -0.57). Bioactive LH correlated inversely with the body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.50). After eliminating the effect of the BMI, the correlation between bioactive LH and insulin was no longer significant (r = -0.37). The bioactive LH and immunoreactive LH/FSH ratio correlated significantly (r = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that hyperandrogenic women can be divided into two subgroups: those with insulin resistance, normal or minimally elevated LH, and markedly elevated insulin levels; and those with elevated LH levels, no insulin resistance, and normal insulin concentrations. Obesity is associated with the former, and high bioactive LH levels with the latter subgroup. 
Acute respiratory infections. During the past decade, recognition of the significance of pneumonia for childhood mortality has greatly increased. Etiologic studies have clarified the role of Streptococcus pneumoniae and H. influenzae as the pathogens most responsible for childhood pneumonia in developing countries. Case management intervention strategies using community health workers to identify cases of pneumonia by counting respiratory rate and observing chest indrawing have been shown to reduce ARI-related mortality. Although research is underway to develop more effective vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae and non-type b H. influenzae, effective case management will remain the most realistic method of reducing mortality in the next decade. Important gaps remain in our understanding of the pathogenesis, etiology, and epidemiology of acute respiratory infections. Our understanding is complicated by the multiplicity of viral and bacterial agents and their interrelationships, by an abundance of interacting host risk factors, and by diverse social, cultural, and environmental factors. However, sufficient knowledge is available to support the implementation of the WHO case management intervention strategies, which will save the lives of the many children now dying because of pneumonia. 
Sclerotherapy of bleeding esophageal varices using a thrombogenic cocktail. The short- and long-term efficacy of a thrombogenic sclerosant (1% tetradecyl sulfate, thrombin, and cefazolin) was studied in 101 patients. The majority of patients had alcoholic cirrhosis with Child's C classification (84/101). Bleeding was controlled in 94 per cent of patients with the first sclerotherapy. In-hospital and early (within 6 weeks) mortality were 14 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively. There was a strong correlation with hospital mortality and the severity of hepatic disease. Long-term follow-up in 70 patients (mean of 16 months) showed that survival correlated with compliance to follow-up sclerotherapy and abstention from further alcohol intake. Mortality in patients compliant with follow-up was 5 per cent (1/19), as compared with 24 per cent (12/51) in patients who were not compliant with follow-up sclerotherapy. The mortality in alcoholic cirrhotic patients who abstained from further alcoholic intake was 6 per cent (1/17), as compared with 23 per cent (10/44) in those who continued to abuse alcohol. No systemic thrombotic or allergic events related to the use of bovine thrombin were noted during a total of 349 sclerotherapy sessions. 
Compartment syndrome complicating prolonged use of the lithotomy position. Two patients with three postoperative calf compartment syndromes, which followed prolonged lithotomy positioning, will be presented. Potential physiologic mechanisms are described, and a review of current cases in literature are summated. 
Levels of morphine and metabolites in CSF during respiratory depression after intraventricular morphine injection. We report a case of respiratory depression after intracerebroventricular morphine administration of a dose inadvertently 10 times greater than the typical daily dose. At the time of the respiratory dysfunction, the concentrations of morphine and its metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were determined. On comparison of these results with previous clinical studies in which there was no respiratory depression, no relationship was found between the occurrence of respiratory depression and the concentration of morphine or its metabolites in the CSF. The occurrence and characteristics of respiratory depression may be related to the concentrations of morphine and its metabolites in bulbar tissue. 
Vaginal adenosis and clear cell carcinoma after 5-fluorouracil treatment for condylomas. Vaginal adenosis and clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina occurred in a 44-year-old woman after treatment for condylomata acuminata. She had no known exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero. Biopsy-proven vaginal adenosis appeared 8 months after intravaginal 5-fluorouracil application for recurrent urogenital condylomata acuminata. Forty months later, biopsies showed residual adenosis with foci of clear cell adenocarcinoma. Although clear cell adenocarcinoma is associated with vaginal adenosis and cervical ectropion in DES-exposed women, its occurrence in adenosis after 5-fluorouracil therapy has not been reported to the authors' knowledge. In this report, this rare but serious complication of treatment of condylomata acuminata is highlighted, and the literature regarding the development of non-DES-associated vaginal adenosis is discussed. 
Study of brain electrolytes and organic osmolytes during correction of chronic hyponatremia. Implications for the pathogenesis of central pontine myelinolysis. Osmotic injury induced by rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia has been implicated in the development of central pontine myelinolysis. Organic osmolytes known previously as "idiogenic osmoles" accumulate intracellularly to protect cells from osmotic injury. We investigated the changes of these organic osmolytes as well as electrolytes in the brain during the induction and correction of chronic hyponatremia. Using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC, we found that in rats with chronic hyponatremia (3 d, serum sodium = 109 +/- 3 meq/liter), brain concentrations of myoinositol (41%), glycerophosphorylcholine (45%), phosphocreatine/creatine (60%), glutamate (53%), glutamine (45%), and taurine (37%) were all significantly decreased compared with control values (percentage control value shown, all P less than 0.01). The contribution of measured organic osmolytes and electrolytes to the total brain osmolality change was 23 and 72%, respectively. With rapid correction by 5% NaCl infusion, significant brain dehydration and elevation of brain Na and Cl levels above the normal range occurred at 24 h. These changes were not seen with slow correction by water deprivation. Reaccumulation of most organic osmolytes except glycerophosphorylcholine is delayed during the correction of hyponatremia and is independent of the correction rate of serum sodium. It is concluded that: most of the change of brain osmolality in chronic hyponatremia can be accounted by the changes in organic osmolytes and brain electrolytes; and rapid correction of hyponatremia is associated with an overshoot of brain sodium and chloride levels along with a low organic osmolyte level. The high cerebral ion concentrations in the absence of adequate concentrations of organic osmolytes may be relevant to the development of central pontine myelinolysis. 
Simulated aggressive skull base erosion in response to benign sinonasal disease. Benign sinonasal masses and slow-growing neoplasms tend to remodel the nasal vault and facial bones, and this is particularly true of nasal polyps and inverted papillomas. However, when such benign masses press against the floor of the anterior cranial fossa and the walls of the sphenoid sinuses, simulated aggressive bone destruction rather than bone remodeling usually occurs. This type of bone destruction implies to the radiologist that a carcinoma may also be present, and this information could dissuade a surgeon from operating with an attempt at cure. In fact, about 90% of the time with inverted papillomas and in virtually all cases of nasal polyposis, no carcinoma is present. The computed tomographic (CT) scans and magnetic resonance images of 14 patients are used to demonstrate these changes. In addition, the CT scans of three patients with malignancies are shown to illustrate the similarity in the bony skull base changes. 
Improved treatment results in boys with overt testicular relapse during or shortly after initial therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A Pediatric Oncology group study. Boys with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have overt testicular relapse (OTR) during initial continuation chemotherapy or within 6 months thereafter have poor outcomes, with long-term survival similar to patients with marrow relapse during treatment. In April 1983, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) adopted for these patients an intensive treatment protocol (POG 8303) consisting of a four-drug systemic reinduction (prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and asparaginase), a brief intensive consolidation phase with teniposide and cytarabine, and a 2-year program of continuation chemotherapy with weekly rotating drug pairs (vincristine/cyclophosphamide and teniposide/cytarabine) with or without (by randomization) four-drug reinforcement pulses every 16 weeks. Bilateral testicular radiation (2600 cGy) was administered during reinduction, and intrathecal chemoprophylaxis was given every 4 to 6 weeks. Among 38 eligible study patients with OTR, 5 had prior or concominant extramedullary relapse in other sites. The median duration of complete remission before OTR was 27 months (range, 10 to 42 months). All 38 patients achieved clinical remission after reinduction. Three patients withdrew while in remission, 22 had another relapse (12 marrow, 5 central nervous system (CNS), 2 testicular, 1 retroperitoneal, 1 prostate, and 1 eye), and 13 (34%) remain in complete remission from 32+ to 74+ months after OTR (median, 53+ months). Eighteen patients had their therapy electively discontinued, and five relapses occurred thereafter. These results are superior to those observed in patients with first marrow relapse treated with the same protocol. Approximately one third of patients with OTR treated with POG protocol 8303 exhibit prolonged second remissions with the potential for cure. 
Confirmation of endosonographic detection of external anal sphincter defects by simultaneous electromyographic mapping. Anal endosonography was performed in 13 consecutive patients with post-traumatic faecal incontinence. Thirteen acoustic defects in the external anal sphincter (two hyperechoic, four of mixed echogenicity and seven hypoechoic) were analysed electromyographically by locating under ultrasound guidance the tip of a concentric needle within the defect. The electromyographic activity in this zone was compared with ultrasonically normal muscle. Eleven of 13 sonographic defects showed no electrical activity on electromyography, there was one technical electromyography failure, and one defect was too deep to be reached by the electromyography needle. The electromyographic response was normal in each case within ultrasonically normal muscle. Anal endosonography is recommended as the initial investigation to locate defects, which may be confirmed electromyographically thereby limiting the number of painful needle insertions required for complete mapping of the external anal sphincter. 
Spirochetes in atrophic skin lesions accompanied by minimal host response in a child with Lyme disease. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which has rarely been observed in the United States, is a late skin manifestation of Lyme borreliosis. A 12-year-old girl who spent summers on Cape Cod presented with a 2-year history of hyperpigmentation and atrophy of the skin on the hands, wrists, and ankles. The skin biopsy specimen of an affected area showed mild dermal fibrosis, a few inflammatory cells, and spirochetes morphologically compatible with Borrelia burgdorferi. An IgG antibody response to B. burgdorferi could be elicited by immunoblotting, but not by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We conclude that this patient had chronic Lyme borreliosis manifested only by indolent infection of the skin. 
Deletional switch recombination occurs in interleukin-4-induced isotype switching to IgE expression by human B cells. There is controversy as to whether deletional rearrangement occurs between the IgM and IgE switch regions (S mu and S epsilon, respectively) during switching to the IgE isotype. We have addressed the issue by stimulating normal human B cells, sorted for lack of expression of surface IgE, to produce IgE by infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the presence of interleukin 4 (IL-4). Genomic DNA was amplified for S mu/S epsilon switch junction fragments by utilizing the nested-primer polymerase chain reaction. Switch junction fragments were amplified from B cells infected with EBV in the presence of IL-4 but not from B cells infected with EBV alone. The DNA sequence of these "switch fragments" revealed direct joining of S mu to S epsilon in each case. The recombination sites within S mu were clustered within 900 base pairs at the 5' end of the switch region, suggesting that there are "hot spots" for recombination within S mu. The S epsilon recombination sites were scattered throughout the S epsilon region. These findings indicate that IL-4-induced isotype switching to IgE production in human B cells is accompanied by DNA rearrangements with joining of S mu to S epsilon. 
Intercostal-to-pulmonary arterial anastomosis, complicated by high-output heart failure: case report. A patient who had high-output heart failure resulting from anastomosis of the intercostal and bronchial arteries to the right pulmonary artery is reported. The patient was a fifty-one year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with left heart failure. A radionuclide angiocardiogram revealed blood flow from the aorta to the right pulmonary artery. A descending aortogram revealed abnormally dilated right intercostal and bronchial arteries, which formed the anastomosis. The right pulmonary artery was visualized via that anastomosis. Tuberculous pleurisy in the patient's history was considered to be the cause of the anastomosis. The therapeutic procedure used was embolization via a catheter for the anastomosis, but most anastomoses could not be embolized. The present report is considered the first on anastomosis of the intercostal artery to the pulmonary artery to the extent that high-output heart failure occurs. 
Tissue plasminogen activator release and plasminogen activator inhibitor levels in coronary artery disease. Unstable angina and Q wave myocardial infarction are associated with intraluminal coronary thrombosis, a process to which impaired fibrinolysis may contribute. The authors examined the extrinsic fibrinolytic system, including tissue plasminogen activator antigen, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity and antigen, and euglobulin clot lysis time before and after venous occlusion in 56 patients undergoing coronary angiography for chest pain syndromes and in 16 healthy controls. Fibrinolysis variables were similar (with greater than 95% confidence) in the patients with thrombus-associated coronary syndromes as compared with those with chest pain syndromes not due to coronary thrombosis. These fibrinolytic variables were also similar to those in patients without coronary artery disease and in healthy controls. Their data suggest that defective fibrinolysis is not involved, at least systemically, in the pathogenesis of thrombus-associated coronary artery syndromes. 
Influence of allopurinol on cardiac complications in open heart operations. During cardiac operations, the heart is subjected to total ischemia and reperfusion, causing serious operative and postoperative complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and infarctions that may be partly due to free radical generation. Thus, allopurinol was tested to see if it could reduce cardiac complications during open heart operations. Ninety patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were studied prospectively. Fortyfive patients were treated with allopurinol and 45 patients acted as controls. Treatment requiring arrhythmias in the allopurinol group was 6.6% compared with 33.3% in the control group (p less than 0.01). The percentage of patients requiring inotropes was significantly lower in the allopurinol group than in the control group (4.4% versus 26.6%; p less than 0.01). Perioperative myocardial infarction did not occur in the allopurinol group but was seen in 8 patients (17.7%) in the control group. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used in 5 control patients (11.1%) but not in the allopurinol group. This study shows that allopurinol decreases significantly the incidence of cardiac complications in open heart operations. 
Cerebral hemodynamics in ischemic cerebrovascular disease. During the past decade, technological advances have made it possible to measure regional cerebral hemodynamics in individual patients. Studies performed with these techniques have demonstrated that the degree of carotid stenosis correlates poorly with the hemodynamic status of the ipsilateral cerebral circulation. The primary determinant of cerebral perfusion pressure and blood flow under these circumstances is the adequacy of collateral circulatory pathways. Since collateral circulation varies from patient to patient, there is no critical degree of carotid stenosis that consistently produces hemodynamic compromise of the cerebral circulation. It is, thus, time to abandon the concept of the hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis as it relates to the pathogenesis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease. Measurements of regional cerebral hemodynamics have provided new insight into the pathogenesis of transient ischemic attacks and generated some preliminary data on the prognostic and therapeutic importance of chronic reductions in regional cerebral perfusion pressure. Further investigations into the importance of hemodynamic factors in ischemic stroke can now be based on accurate assessment of cerebral (not carotid or vertebrobasilar) hemodynamics in the context of other coexisting epidemiological, clinical, hematological, and angiographic risk factors. 
The impact of breast cancer on sexuality, body image, and intimate relationships. For women, breast cancer remains a common and dreaded experience. It is normal for a diagnosis of breast cancer to evoke grief, anger, and intense fear. Most women, however, face this crisis and master it without developing major psychiatric disorders or severe sexual dysfunction. The options of breast conservation and reconstruction give women a new sense of control over their treatment and are quite successful in helping women feel comfortable with their bodies again. The effectiveness of breast conservation and reconstruction in preventing or ameliorating sexual problems after breast cancer diagnosis is less clear, however. Any impact these options have on sexuality is subtle and may relate more to a woman's feelings of being desirable than to how often she has sex, her lovemaking practices, or how much she enjoys sex. We need more information on how chemotherapy and hormonal therapy affect women's sex lives. As clinicians, we should pay more attention to our patients' complaints of vaginal pain, dryness, and overall loss of sexual desire during systemic treatment. Practical advice on lovemaking techniques and a clinician's open attitude towards discussing sexual issues can prevent a great deal of anxiety and sadness as women with breast cancer search for ways to keep their sex lives satisfying. 
Natural anticoagulants in systemic lupus erythematosus. Deficiency of protein S bound to C4bp associates with recent history of venous thromboses, antiphospholipid antibodies, and the antiphospholipid syndrome. The association of thrombosis with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could be due to their interference with natural phospholipid dependent anticoagulant mechanisms. We studied antigenic protein C (APC), functional protein C (FPC), free protein S (FPS), protein S bound to C4 binding protein (C4bp-S), antithrombin III (ATIII), as well as IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 38 patients with SLE with a history of thromboses and 70 patients with SLE without such history. We found a high frequency of deficiencies of natural anticoagulants in both groups of patients with SLE but, because of patient selection, we could not determine the actual prevalence of these defects. Patients having had a venous thrombosis in the previous year had low C4bp-S more frequently than patients with older or no thromboses. When we divided our patients with SLE into those who had a definite, probable, questionable or no antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS) we found the frequency of C4bp-S deficiency to be significantly higher in those with definite aPS than in those without aPS. Intermediate proportions were found in patients with probable and questionable aPS. The levels of C4bp-S decreased as the levels of aCL, particularly IgG, increased. Stepwise discriminant analysis of natural anticoagulants selected deficiencies of C4bp-S and FPC with increased ATIII as a set of variables with highest predictive power for classification of patients with and without aPS. Thus, deficiencies of natural anticoagulants may occur frequently in patients with SLE. 
Parathyroid adenoma in a cancer center patient population. The association of parathyroid adenoma and antecedent events or relationships was examined retrospectively in 103 patients with parathyroid adenoma drawn from a cancer institute patient population. Patients were divided into two study groups by the referral pattern-intramural or community. The major contrast between the two groups was that the intramural patients had cancer diagnoses. The factors of advanced age, female gender, and prior regional irradiation appeared to be associated with the development of parathyroid adenoma. An interrelationship of incidental cancer and parathyroid adenoma, however, was not supported. Breast and differential thyroid cancers were most frequently associated with parathyroid adenoma, but age, gender, and irradiation were bias influences. 
Correlations between fibrinolytic function and acute myocardial infarction. The diurnal variation of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor--2 important factors in regulation of fibrinolysis--is well established, but its clinical implications are not yet fully understood. Fibrinolytic function was measured in a group of 133 patients less than 45 years of age, 3 months after they presented with myocardial infarction, and they were compared with an equal group of carefully matched control subjects. A sub-sample of 71 patients and 50 control subjects was examined 3 years later. Tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor plasma levels were higher in patients versus control subjects at 3 months and at 3 years after myocardial infarction, with a high degree of correlation between the 2 determinations (r = 0.87). Of all hemostatic parameters studied, only low tissue plasminogen activator activity and increased tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor levels were significantly different between patients with and without recurrent infarction during the 3-year period. In those patients with a second infarction greater than 3 years later, however, tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor concentration was not significantly related to reinfarction. 
Intractable heart failure despite angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, digoxin, and diuretics: long-term effectiveness of add-on therapy with pimobendan. In 25 patients whose chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) had recently worsened to New York Heart Association class IV, pimobendan (5 to 20 mg/day) was added to maximum conventional therapy consisting of digoxin, diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, coumadin derivatives to prevent thromboembolic complications, and amiodarone to suppress serious ventricular rhythm disturbances. CHF was fatal in less than 1 month in five patients (two had shown some initial improvement). The other 20 had sustained improvement by at least one functional class, interrupted by episodes of CHF that usually responded to intravenous therapy. Median survival was 12 months (range 10 days to greater than 3 years); five patients died suddenly, 12 died of intractable CHF, and two died of other causes. Six patients were alive 3 years after the onset of treatment with pimobendan. Add-on therapy with pimobendan produced a sustained improvement in many patients with severe CHF that was no longer responding to a combination of digoxin, diuretics, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. 
A successful murine model for contact sensitization to a sesquiterpene-alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone: sensitization to alantolactone in four strains of mice. Induction of allergic contact hypersensitivity to a sesquiterpene lactone, alantolactone, was studied in four strains of mice: C3H/He, DBA/2, Balb/b, and Balb/c. The last three were successfully sensitized. A significant dose/response was demonstrated in these species, as well as an experimental "overload effect" in Balb/c and Balb/b strains. Histologic studies confirmed the allergic nature of the reaction. From the overall results, alantolactone can be considered a moderate sensitizer in mouse as well as in guinea pig. This study shows that the murine model can be used for experimental contact sensitization with moderate allergens, without the use of Freund's adjuvant for induction. 
Lumbar regional anaesthesia and prophylactic anticoagulant therapy. Is the combination safe? A survey has been carried out in all Danish anaesthetic departments (n = 80) regarding the attitude towards the use of epidural/spinal lumbar analgesia in patients who were receiving prophylactic anticoagulant therapy for the prevention of thromboembolism. About 60% of the departments used the techniques in patients receiving low-dose heparin and no side effects had been experienced. Spinal and epidural anaesthesia were in general regarded as being contraindicated in patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. In the world literature, the attitude towards the combination is conflicting. No randomised trial has been performed and complications are almost entirely confined to patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists. Only one case of an epidural haematoma has been recorded when subcutaneous low-dose heparin was used as thromboprophylaxis. 
Eyelid necrosis and periorbital necrotizing fasciitis. Report of a case and review of the literature. Necrotizing fasciitis is an uncommon and severe soft tissue infection characterized by cutaneous gangrene, suppurative fasciitis, and vascular thrombosis. The disease is usually preceded by trauma in patients that have systemic problems, most commonly diabetes and alcoholism. Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus are the most frequent bacterial etiologies; however, combinations of numerous facultative and anaerobic organisms have also been isolated. Involvement of the face and periocular region is rare. A case is presented here, as well as a review of the clinical features of 15 other patients previously described, in whom eyelid necrosis due to periorbital necrotizing fasciitis developed. Early surgical debridement and drainage of necrotic tissues and appropriate parenteral antibiotics are the mainstay of therapy. The mortality rate in patients with periorbital spread was 12.5%, with the prognosis known to be adversely affected by delay in diagnosis and treatment and/or extension of infection from the face to the neck. Reconstruction of the eyelids with skin grafts was necessary in most cases to avoid such complications as cicatricial lid retraction, lid malpositions, and lagophthalmos. 
Relative kindling effect of detoxification and non-detoxification admissions in alcoholics. We reviewed the histories of 340 men and 60 women who were admitted for alcohol detoxification to determine if hospitalizations unrelated to detoxification increased the prevalence of seizures observed in these patients. Previous investigations on this cohort suggested that recurrent detoxification admissions increased the probability of seizure histories. Detoxification and non-detoxification hospitalizations were calculated from patient reports and chart reviews on patients admitted for alcohol detoxification. Discriminant analysis of each type of hospitalization and total hospitalizations for each sex revealed an increased risk of seizure activity correlating with non-detoxification hospitalizations, but the correlation was weaker than that observed for detoxification admissions and for total admissions. This correlation between hospitalizations and seizure prevalence supports the hypothesis that recurrent alcohol withdrawal may have a kindling effect. 
Effects of protein size on the rate of import of the precursors of aldehyde dehydrogenase and ornithine transcarbamylase into rat liver mitochondria. It is known that a signal peptide is required for the import of a protein into mitochondrial matrix. It is also known that a signal peptide can be attached to any protein and allow it to be imported. We recently reported that the rate of import of rat liver mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor was slower than that of ornithine transcarbamylase precursor (Wang TTY, Farres J, and Weiner H. Arch Biochem Biophys 272, 440-449, 1989). It was not known if the difference in the rate of import was related to the fact that the mature portion of aldehyde dehydrogenase is larger (500 amino acids compared with 322 amino acids) or because the signal peptides were different. We further showed that treatment of the mitochondria with alcohols caused an inhibition of the import of the precursor of aldehyde dehydrogenase but not that of ornithine transcarbamylase. In the present study we constructed chimeric proteins that contained the signal peptide from one precursor protein and the mature portion from the other. We found that the rate of import was related to the overall size of the precursor protein. Consistent with this observation was finding that a truncated aldehyde dehydrogenase precursor, which contained 317 amino acids, was imported more rapidly than was the authentic precursor. Consistent with this finding was the fact that butanol caused the inhibition of only the large precursor proteins. Thus, it appears that size of the protein being imported is a major determinant of the rate at which a precursor protein is imported into mitochondria. 
Orthotopic cardiac transplantation in two patients with previous malignancy. This report presents 2 patients with previous malignancy in whom congestive cardiomyopathy developed secondary to doxorubicin toxicity. Both patients underwent orthotopic cardiac transplantation 3 and 5 years ago and are now in functional class I with no evidence of malignant recurrence. 
Weight-loss experience of black and white participants in NHLBI-sponsored clinical trials. We examined race-specific weight-loss results from two randomized, multicenter trials; the Hypertension Prevention Trial (HPT) and the Trials of Hypertension Prevention (TOHP). Mean weight change from baseline averaged 2.2 kg less in black women than in white women during 18 mo of follow-up in TOHP and 2.7 kg less during 36 mo of follow-up in HPT. Mean weight loss averaged 2.0 kg less in black than in white men in TOHP and 1.4 kg less in HPT. Because of greater weight gain in black control subjects, a comparison of net weight loss (change in intervention minus change in control participants, within-race) showed a less marked difference than did black-white differences in weight loss within the actively treated group. Thus, relative to weight that would have been gained without the intervention, the experience of blacks and whites was more similar. Racial differences in weight loss may result from a combination of behavioral, sociocultural, biological, and programmatic factors. 
Angioscopically directed valvulotomy: a new valvulotome and technique. Despite a large experience with "blind" retrograde valvulotomy in in situ vein bypass grafting, the incidence of residual competent valves remains high, and valvulotome-induced injury is common. In this study we describe a new valvulotome and technique of angioscopically directed valvulotomy and review the video tape recordings of 85 completion angioscopies of in situ femorodistal bypasses. Fifty-three vein grafts were prepared with the blind retrograde valvulotomy technique and 32 vein grafts with the new valvulotome and angioscopy. The use of the new valvulotome and technique is compared with that of the standard blind retrograde valvulotomy technique, and the normal endoluminal anatomy and incidence of primary disease in saphenous vein grafts was noted. The incidence of valvulotome-induced injury was 5/32 (15.6%) and 45/53 (85%) in vein grafts prepared with angioscopically directed valvulotomy and blind retrograde valvulotomy, respectively. Residual competent valves were found in 10/53 (18.9%) in blind retrograde valvulotomy and 0/25 of angioscopically directed valvulotomy vein grafts (p = 0.0114). In 22/53 vein grafts unsuspected primary disease was detected. Angioscopically directed valvulotomy with the new valvulotome and technique is feasible, reliable, and safe. It avoids residual competent valves, minimizes valvulotome-induced injury, and allows the detection and correction of unappreciated primary vein graft abnormalities. The new valvulotome and technique is a first step in the complete endoluminal preparation of the in situ vein graft. 
Predictors of death from aortic aneurysm among middle-aged men: the Whitehall study. Among 18,403 male civil servants examined at age 40-64 years there were 99 deaths attributed to aortic aneurysm during 18 years of follow-up. Each case was matched by age to ten controls who survived longer than the case. The risk of all types of fatal aneurysm was substantially increased for current smokers of manufactured cigarettes (rate ratio compared with lifelong non-smokers = 6.5; 95 per cent confidence interval 2.3-18.7), pipe or cigars (6.7; 1.7-26.5) and hand-rolled cigarettes (25.0; 7.5-83.3). Diastolic blood pressure was strongly associated with dissecting aneurysm (rate ratio per 10 mmHg increase = 2.4; 95 per cent confidence interval 1.7-3.2) and abdominal aneurysm (1.5; 1.2-1.9) but not other aneurysms (1.0; 0.7-1.5). The independent effects of height, adiposity, plasma cholesterol, glucose intolerance, reported angina and intermittent claudication were not significant. Hypertension and smoking, particularly of hand-rolled cigarettes, are confirmed as major and potentially remediable risk factors for fatal aortic aneurysm. 
Endothelial cell seeding. Endothelial cell seeding is a technique that has developed over the past 15 years in response to the need for a high performance synthetic vascular graft. This review details our present knowledge of seeding and examines the various problems that have hampered its introduction into clinical practice. 
Smoking and hypertension: risk factors for carotid stenosis. The prevalence of smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus was assessed in 221 patients suffering from internal carotid stenosis and compared with the prevalences in two sex- and age-matched control groups composed of subjects having normal Doppler findings and from non-neurological outpatients. Of the subjects with carotid stenosis 27.6% were hypertensive smokers in comparison with 9.5% and 17.2% in the two control groups. The difference of the stenosis cohort from the two control groups was significant (P less than 0.01 and P = 0.016 respectively). There was no statistically significant differences between the occurrence of diabetes and hypertension in non-smokers and patients who smoked. In 394 investigated patients suffering from carotid stenosis or occlusion an obstruction index, based on the Doppler shift frequency, was calculated. This index was lowest in the normotentive non-smokers. It was only insignificantly higher in the hypertensive non-smokers but significantly so in the normotensive smokers. The index was highest in the hypertensive non-smokers. It was concluded that cigarette smoking, especially if associated with hypertension, is a determinant risk factor for carotid stenosis and occlusion. 
Frequency of abnormal sphincter of Oddi manometry compared with the clinical suspicion of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Patients with pancreaticobiliary pain or idiopathic pancreatitis have been classified as having definitive (type I), presumptive (type II), or possible (type III) sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) based on clinical, laboratory, and ERCP data. This study was undertaken to determine the frequency of abnormal sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) when patients are classified by this system. Two hundred and thirteen patients with pancreaticobiliary pain were evaluated clinically; SOM, ERCP, and ductal contrast drainage time tests were performed. For biliary types I, II, and III, the frequency of abnormal SOM was 85.7%, 55.1%, and 28.1%, respectively. Similarly, for pancreatic types I, II, and III, an elevated basal sphincter pressure occurred in 92.3%, 58.2%, and 35.1%, respectively. When patients with an abnormal basal sphincter pressure were characterized by the magnitude of the elevation, the manometric profiles were similar for types I, II, and III. These data suggest that elevated sphincter pressure occurs more frequently in type III patients than previously reported, and supports consideration of SOM when evaluating and treating type II and type III patients. 
Gastroesophageal reflux, as measured by 24-hour pH monitoring, in 509 healthy infants screened for risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Continuous long-term esophageal pH monitoring has become the preferred test to quantify acid gastroesophageal reflux. Because reflux to a limited extent is physiologic, the determination of optimal thresholds to separate normal from abnormal reflux is mandatory. Esophageal pH was measured during 24 hours in 509 healthy thriving infants, aged 3 days to 1 year, using a glass microelectrode with an external reference electrode connected to a portable recorder. Percentiles of the four parameters studied (reflux index or percent of the investigation time with a pH less than 4, number of episodes with a pH less than 4 during 24 hours, number of episodes lasting greater than 5 minutes, the duration of the longest episode (in minutes) are presented. A percentile curve of the reflux index regarding the age distribution shows that the normal range for the reflux index during the first 12 months of life is about 10% (95 percentile), decreasing from 13% at birth to 8% at 12 months. Application of an age-related percentile curve offers a close-to-reality possibility of data interpretation and illustrates that there is inevitably an overlap of data between normal and abnormal populations, because reflux is a phenomenon occurring to some extent in every human being. 
Abnormal hormonal and renal responses to saline load in hypertensive patients with parental history of cardiovascular accidents. BACKGROUND. Acute cardiac and cerebrovascular accidents are more frequent in hypertensive subjects with a family history of acute vascular accidents. The mechanisms underlying the susceptibility to vascular disease in these subjects are unknown. We investigated whether a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke in hypertensive subjects is associated with abnormalities of sodium handling. METHODS AND RESULTS. Patients with mild, uncomplicated essential hypertension were divided into two subgroups according to family history: a subgroup with a parental history of premature heart attack or stroke (FV+, n = 18) and a subgroup with a family history completely negative for vascular accidents (FV-, n = 14). The two subgroups were comparable with respect to age, weight, sex distribution, blood pressure, duration of hypertension, cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, and organ damage. Baseline plasma renin activity (PRA), concentrations of aldosterone (PA), atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), and norepinephrine, and urinary electrolyte excretion were also comparable in the two subgroups. Despite these similarities, the responses to an acute saline load, measured under controlled metabolic and experimental conditions, were different in the two subgroups. In the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes of saline load, PRA fell by 1.0 +/- 0.2 ng/ml/hr and PA concentration by 89.4 +/- 26 pg/ml and ANF concentration increased by 38 +/- 9 pg/ml, whereas in the FV- subgroup the corresponding responses were -2.3 +/- 0.3 ng/ml/hr (p less than 0.005), -190 +/- 43 pg/ml (p less than 0.05), and 80 +/- 13 pg/ml (p less than 0.005), respectively. Urinary sodium excretion was delayed in the FV+ subgroup (270 +/- 67 mu eq/min at 60 minutes) compared with the FV- subgroup (555 +/- 157 mu eq/min at 60 minutes, p less than 0.05). At 120 minutes of saline load, significant (p less than 0.005) differences in PRA and ANF concentration were still observed. In a control group of eight normal subjects the responses to a saline load were comparable to those in the FV- subgroup but greater than those in the FV+ subgroup at 60 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide evidence that the hormonal and renal adjustments to an acute salt load are impaired in hypertensive patients with a parental history of vascular accidents. We speculate that abnormalities of sodium handling may represent markers of a more rapid development of vascular injury in human hypertension. 
Total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthrosis in patients who have Paget disease of bone at the knee. Thirteen patients who had had sixteen total knee arthroplasties for pagetic gonarthrosis were followed for a mean of seven years (range, two to fifteen years). Involvement of the femur or tibia with Paget disease was associated with multiple technical difficulties at operation and with a final position in suboptimum varus or valgus alignment (ten limbs) or suboptimum alignment of the mechanical axis (nine limbs). The presence of bone with Paget disease did not affect the amount of blood lost during the operation, the postoperative course, or the rate of loosening of the prostheses. At the most recent evaluation, nine patients had no pain, three had mild pain, and one had moderate pain. The mean Knee Society pain score improved from 42 points preoperatively to 88 points and the mean functional score, from 33 to 86 points. 
Management of traumatic injuries to the facial nerve. Penetrating and nonpenetrating trauma to the head and neck produces myriad injuries to the facial nerve. This article presents a rationale of management of neural injury, emphasizing extracranial and intratemporal trauma and techniques of neurorrhaphy. 
Anterior plate fixation in spine tumor surgery. Indications, technique, and results. Anterior decompression by vertebrectomy is now well established as the procedure of choice to optimize neurologic recovery in patients with a deficit due to tumor involvement of the vertebral body. Fifteen patients with tumor involvement of the cervical or thoracic spine and neurologic deficit were treated by single-stage anterior decompression and AO plate stabilization. No patient suffered neurologic deterioration after surgery. All patients with thoracic lesions who were unable to walk on presentation and who managed to survive their primary disease improved to a level that allowed independent ambulation with a frame. There were no problems, such as loss of fixation or deformity. It is concluded that standard AO plates provide adequate stabilization of the cervical and thoracic spine after vertebrectomy for tumor involvement. 
PAF-induced bowel necrosis. Effects of vasodilators. Ischemic bowel necrosis in the rat is produced by injecting platelet-activating factor (PAF) intravenously. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after PAF injection, we hypothesize that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. We thus studied the effects of vasodilators in this model. We found that: (1) Phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615 (leukotriene antagonist) and PGE1 counteracted the PAF-induced mesenteric flow reduction and ameliorated the bowel injury. However, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin were relatively ineffective in correcting PAF-induced hypotension, showing that bowel injury can be prevented independently of the hypotensive state. (2) Nitroglycerin failed to prevent bowel injury, although it improved the mesenteric blood flow. Thus, in opposition to our initial hypothesis, correction of the mesenteric flow reduction induced by PAF does not always prevent intestineal necrosis. (3) Only phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615, and PGE1 ameliorated PAF-induced hemoconcentration and bowel injury. This suggests a correlation between vascular injury (expressed by "leaky" vessels and the consequent hemoconcentration) and bowel necrosis. (4) Although both nitroglycerin and hydralazine relax smooth muscle, hydralazine seemed to aggravate bowel necrosis. The mechanism remains unclear. 
Benign intrinsic tectal "tumors" in children. A specific group of intrinsic dorsal midbrain tumors was identified in six children by computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Each patient presented with raised intracranial pressure as a result of hydrocephalus due to obstruction of the sylvian aqueduct. No patient had brain-stem signs referable to the tectal tumor initially or subsequently. All six children underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversionary procedures. The radiological features were consistent and specific, with all patients showing tectal calcification or primary increased attenuation of the tectal plate on CT scans. In addition, lack of contrast enhancement was noted initially in four patients and eventually in all six patients. In all patients MR imaging showed a focal tectal tumor distorting the collicular plate with no cystic component and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. There has been no evidence of progression in these six patients in the follow-up period ranging from 8 months to 17 years (8 months and 2 1/2, 4 1/2, 8, and 17 years). Diversion of CSF has been the only surgical treatment and no patient underwent deep x-ray therapy. Five patients have had normal intellectual development. In contrast to the majority of previously described periaqueductal and tectal tumors, this group of lesions appeared to be truly benign. The authors suggest that patients presenting with these clinical and radiological features may be managed by CSF diversion, serial examination, and MR imaging. 
Appearance of thrombosis-inducing activity in the plasma of patients undergoing pulmonary resection. Thrombosis-inducing activity (TIA) was detected in the peripheral blood of patients with lung cancer who had undergone pulmonary resection. TIA was examined by intravenously injecting plasma from the patients into BALB/c mice. The plasma containing TIA induced multiple thromboses in the lung and caused the mice to die 3 to 30 minutes after injection. The subjects were 19 patients whose plasma contained no TIA before operation. TIA was detected in 5.3 percent (1/19) on the first postoperative day (POD), 47.4 percent (9/19) on the seventh POD, 47.1 percent (8/17) on the 14th POD, 26.7 percent (4/15) on the 21st POD, and 20 percent (2/10) on the 28th POD. Plasma fibrinogen levels and peripheral platelet counts increased postoperatively and reached a maximum on the seventh and 14th POD, respectively. Peripheral blood with TIA had a significant elevation of plasma fibrinogen levels and platelet counts as compared to that without TIA. These observations suggest that TIA is present in blood in a hypercoagulable state in patients after pulmonary resection. Since tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 are known to induce hypercoagulable states both in vitro and in vivo, we tried to determine whether it was possible to detect both cytokines in blood indicated as hypercoagulable state by the presence of TIA. They did not, however, reach detectable levels in the blood. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma, alcohol, and cirrhosis: facts and hypotheses. Despite the epidemiological evidence of a correlation between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma, some of the results of experimental and clinical studies remain controversial. Apart from inducing cirrhosis, which may be viewed as a precancerous liver lesion, ethanol may act as a cocarcinogen. Most investigations on this topic have focused on two aspects: ethanol's capacity to induce the cytochrome P-450-dependent microsomal biotransformation system and its interference with at least one DNA repair mechanism. Ethanol exposure enhances the capacity of mixed function oxidases to activate many chemical carcinogens, such as dimethylnitrosamine (DMN). On the other hand, ethanol exposure fails to influence DMN-induced liver carcinogenesis. The capacity of alcohol to inhibit DMN-demethylase activity has not been clearly demonstrated in experiments carried out with human tissue. In conclusion, both the effects of ethanol and their underlying mechanisms as regards liver carcinogenesis are open to debate. The link between ethanol abuse and hepatocellular carcinoma appears to be mediated mainly by its capacity to induce cirrhosis. 
Finger tremor after carbon disulfide-based pesticide exposures. Index finger tremor accompanying voluntary movement was studied in 19 age-matched control subjects and in 19 grain industry employees chronically exposed to carbon disulfide-based fumigants. Visual judgments of tremor amplitude made by neurologists during clinical examinations equaled the sensitivity of computerized tremor amplitude measurements. Tremor frequency variations detectable only with computerized measurement were present in grain workers with and without increased tremor amplitudes. Frequency differences discriminated between normal subjects and 74% of the grain workers. The distribution of tremor frequency power in the grain workers was often sequestered at 5 to 7 Hz, reminiscent of tremor in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. These findings suggest that the measurement of subtle tremor frequency changes may provide an early indication of chronic carbon disulfide poisoning. 
Chronic diarrhea. A practical approach for the pediatrician. Despite the high prevalence of chronic diarrhea there is no universal approach to its diagnosis and treatment. This article summarizes the pathophysiologic processes that result in chronic diarrhea and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic approach to this often distressing problem. 
Long-term complications of polyurethane-covered breast implants. The authors's personal experience using an earlier manufactured polyurethane-covered gel prosthesis is presented. Very long-term follow-up did not validate the author's initial enthusiasm. It is to be hoped that the newer polyurethane-covered implants will give more satisfactory long-term results. 
Transformed mammalian cells are deficient in kinase-mediated control of progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle. To investigate the role of kinase-mediated mechanisms in regulating mammalian cell proliferation, we determined the effects of the general protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine on the proliferation of a series of nontransformed and transformed cultured rodent and human cells. Levels of staurosporine as low as 1 ng/ml prevented nontransformed cells from entering S phase (i.e., induced G1 arrest), indicating that kinase-mediated processes are essential for commitment to DNA replication in normal cells. At higher concentrations of staurosporine (50-75 ng/ml), nontransformed mammalian cells were arrested in both G1 and G2. The period of sensitivity of nontransformed human diploid fibroblasts to low levels of the drug commenced 3 hr later than the G0/G1 boundary and extended through the G1/S boundary. Interference with activity of the G1-essential kinase(s) caused nontransformed human cells traversing mid-to-late G1 at the time of staurosporine addition to be "set back" to the initial staurosporine block point, suggesting the existence of a kinase-dependent "G1 clock" mechanism that must function continuously throughout the early cycle in normal cells. The initial staurosporine block point at 3 hr into G1 corresponds to neither the serum nor the amino acid restriction point. In marked contrast to the behavior of nontransformed cells, neither low nor high concentrations of staurosporine affected G1 progression in transformed cultures; high drug concentrations caused transformed cells to be arrested solely in G2. These results indicate that kinase-mediated regulation of DNA replication is lost as the result of neoplastic transformation, but the G2-arrest mechanism remains intact. 
Lineage-restricted clonality in biphasic solid tumors. Cytogenetic analysis of two pulmonary chondroid hamartomas and nine breast adenofibromas revealed clonal chromosome aberrations in both hamartomas and in four breast tumors. To determine lineage of the cells with chromosome aberrations, a combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic approach was developed that enabled simultaneous ascertainment of cytogenetic aberrations and immunohistochemical features in individual cells. Immunohistochemical/cytogenetic evaluation of one hamartoma and two adenofibromas demonstrated that neoplastic proliferation, in each case, was confined to the mesenchymal (stromal) component, whereas epithelial cells appeared to be reactive. Cytogenetically abnormal short-term cultures of the remaining hamartoma and another of the breast adenofibromas were composed entirely of mesenchymal elements, indicating mesenchymal clonality in those tumors as well. Our findings support redesignation of pulmonary chondroid hamartomas as 'pulmonary chondromas' and suggest that carcinomas developing within fibroadenomas arise from reactive epithelial proliferation. Combined immunohistochemical/cytogenetic analysis might be useful in the development of novel therapeutic approaches that selectively target neoplastic populations within solid tumors. 
Instability of a 550-base pair DNA segment and abnormal methylation in fragile X syndrome. The fragile X syndrome, a common cause of inherited mental retardation, is characterized by an unusual mode of inheritance. Phenotypic expression has been linked to abnormal cytosine methylation of a single CpG island, at or very near the fragile site. Probes adjacent to this island detected very localized DNA rearrangements that constituted the fragile X mutations, and whose target was a 550-base pair GC-rich fragment. Normal transmitting males had a 150- to 400-base pair insertion that was inherited by their daughters either unchanged, or with small differences in size. Fragile X-positive individuals in the next generation had much larger fragments that differed among siblings and showed a generally heterogeneous pattern indicating somatic mutation. The mutated allele appeared unmethylated in normal transmitting males, methylated only on the inactive X chromosome in their daughters, and totally methylated in most fragile X males. However, some males had a mosaic pattern. Expression of the fragile X syndrome thus appears to result from a two-step mutation as well as a highly localized methylation. Carriers of the fragile X mutation can easily be detected regardless of sex or phenotypic expression, and rare apparent false negatives may result from genetic heterogeneity or misdiagnosis. 
Lichen planus and mesalazine. Lichen planus is a recognized complication of sulfasalazine therapy. Two patients developed typical oral and cutaneous lichen planus on sulfasalazine and their skin lesions recurred when they were subsequently changed to mesalazine. Lichen planus only resolved on withdrawal of both drugs. It seems likely that the aminosalicylic acid moiety is responsible for this reaction and that lichen planus is a true complication of mesalazine therapy. 
Bacteremia in febrile patients. A clinical model for diagnosis. Among 244 patients aged 18 to 98 years who were consecutively hospitalized in a department of internal medicine because of a febrile disease, 52 (21%) were bacteremic. On a logistic regression analysis, five variables known within 24 hours of admission were found to be associated both significantly and independently with bacteremia: low serum albumin level, low premorbid performance status, chills, renal failure, and an assumptive diagnosis of urinary tract infection on admission. The logistic model was used to divide patients into three groups. In group 1, the percentage of bacteremic patients was 5%, in group 2, 40%, and in group 3, 83%. The percentage of deaths in the three groups was 0%, 23%, and 50%, respectively. The model was validated in a second group of 257 patients. The percentage of bacteremia was 1% in group 1, 23% in group 2, and 65% in group 3. The death rate in three groups was 3%, 4%, and 35%, respectively. The accuracy of the attending physician in diagnosing bacteremia within 24 hours of hospitalization was compared with that of the model. Use of the model could have improved the diagnostic accuracy in 5% of the patients in group 1 and in 18% of patients in group 3. 
Pharmacologic roles of heparin and glucocorticoids to prevent restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Restenosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is the major clinical problem limiting the long-term efficacy of this treatment for coronary atherosclerosis. Recent advances in the understanding of the biology of restenosis indicate that intimal hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells is the predominant cause for restenosis. Therefore, therapeutic agents that inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation should be candidate drugs to prevent restenosis. Heparin has documented antiproliferative effects on smooth muscle cells, and the availability of low molecular weight heparins that lack anticoagulant properties makes them ideal agents. Glucocorticoids have wide effects on inflammatory and wound healing events and inhibit smooth muscle cell growth in culture and in animal models of arterial injury. Recent laboratory data suggest that combination therapy with both low molecular weight heparin and hydrocortisone may be a powerful treatment regimen to limit restenosis. 
Haemodynamic interactions of muscle relaxants and sufentanil in coronary artery surgery. The haemodynamic interactions between sufentanil (S) and muscle relaxants (MR) were studied in 40 ASA physical status III or IV patients (four groups of ten) scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting (ABG). Group I received pancuronium (P) 0.08 mg.kg-1, Group II received vecuronium (V) 0.1 mg.kg-1, Group III received atracurium (A) 0.5 mg.kg-1 and Group IV metocurine 0.1 mg.kg-1 plus pancuronium 0.02 mg.kg-1 (M-P). Sufentanil, 20 micrograms.kg-1 was administered before sternotomy, 10 micrograms.kg-1 being injected before tracheal intubation and 10 micrograms.kg-1 afterwards. Heart rate (HR), ECG leadII and V5, systolic, diastolic and mean arterial and pulmonary blood pressures, central venous pressure (CVP) and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (W) were measured and recorded at the time of seven strategic events between the pre-induction of anaesthesia period and sternotomy. Cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistances (SVR) were also measured before induction of anaesthesia and after the administration of S 10 micrograms.kg-1 plus the MR. The HR decreased from baseline values in the post-tracheal intubation period in all groups except in P group. The mean arterial pressure also decreased significantly in all groups except in the P group. The CO did not change from baseline values but SVR decreased in all groups. There was no evidence of new myocardial ischaemia according to the ECG monitoring and there was no significant difference in the HR changes between patients who had or who had not received beta-blockers in any group. We conclude that within the present study conditions and design, HR and blood pressure changed least with pancuronium. 
Coronary artery vasoregulation and left ventricular function in patients with angina pectoris-like pain and normal coronary angiograms. Twenty patients with angina pectoris-like pain, normal coronary angiography and abnormal exercise 201Tl scans were investigated by means of haemodynamic, coronary sinus blood flow and lactate determinations before and after cold provocation, pacing and dipyridamole infusion. Radionuclide angiography, a new exercise 201Tl scan and noninvasive hyperventilation and ergonovine tests were performed. Intracoronary infusions of acetylcholine were given in increasing doses and a second coronary angiogram in combination with a 201Tl scintigram was performed. Despite a previously pathological 201Tl scintigram, with reversible perfusion defects, only ten of the patients had reversible perfusion defects at the second investigation. Hyperventilation and ergonovine tests did not result in ECG signs indicative of coronary spasm. Intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine resulted in a diffuse coronary constriction in 3 of 14 patients, and in one patient a perfusion defect was observed on thallium scintigram. In conclusion, although most of the common methods for inducing coronary vasospasm were used, no consistent pattern of reaction was found to explain the chest pains experienced in this group of patients. 
Atrial natriuretic peptide-induced relaxation of pre-constricted isolated rat perfused lungs: a comparison in control and hypoxia-adapted animals. 1. To further understand the vasodilator actions of atrial natriuretic peptide and its role in hypoxic pulmonary hypertension, we studied the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide in the isolated perfused rat lung during normoxic ventilation and after elevation of pulmonary artery pressure by either hypoxic ventilation or infusion of prostaglandin F2 alpha. Control animals were compared with littermates that had become adapted to a 10% O2 environment for 3 weeks. Atrial natriuretic peptide was compared with atriopeptin I and atriopeptin III in order to study its structure-activity relationship. 2. Five experiments, each involving six control and six chronically hypoxic rats, were performed. During normoxic ventilation, atrial natriuretic peptide (30 ng-3 micrograms) produced a dose-dependent reduction in pulmonary artery pressure in chronically hypoxic rats, but had no action in the control animals. 3. Atrial natriuretic peptide dose-dependently abolished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction to a greater extent in chronically hypoxic rats (EC50 98 ng) than in control rats (EC50 298 ng; P less than 0.001). Bolus atrial natriuretic peptide (100 ng) produced a plasma concentration of 22.6 pmol/l at 1 min, which is within the pathophysiological range. Initial plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels were 9.4 pmol/l in control animals and 27.4 pmol/l in chronically hypoxic rats. 4. Chronically hypoxic rats were more sensitive to atriopeptin I, atriopeptin III and atrial natriuretic peptide than were the control rats (P less than 0.05). Atrial natriuretic peptide and atriopeptin III were equipotent and were 10 times more potent than atriopeptide I in both groups (P less than 0.001). 
Midazolam improves electrophysiologic recovery after anoxia and reduces the changes in ATP levels and calcium influx during anoxia in the rat hippocampal slice. Since blockers of excitatory transmission have been shown to reduce anoxic and ischemic neuronal damage, augmentation of inhibitory transmission by agents such as midazolam might have a similar protective effect. Rat hippocampal slices were maintained in vitro and used to determine whether and by what mechanism midazolam improves recovery of evoked responses after anoxia. The Schaffer collateral pathway in the slice was stimulated electrically, and an extracellular potential, the evoked population spike, was recorded from the CA1 pyramidal cells, which are postsynaptic. The slices were made anoxic by substituting artificial cerebrospinal fluid aerated with 95% nitrogen-5% carbon dioxide for fluid aerated with 95% oxygen-5% carbon dioxide. Percentage recovery was expressed as the amplitude of the evoked population spike 60 min after anoxia divided by its preanoxic amplitude. Protection in this model is defined as a significant (P less than 0.05) improvement in percentage recovery compared to the recovery of untreated slices. There was no recovery of the response recorded from CA1 pyramidal cells after 5 min of anoxia (4 +/- 2%) (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]). Slices were treated with midazolam 10 min before, during, and 10 min after anoxia. Midazolam (1 microM) did not enhance recovery after anoxia when dissolved either in water (3 +/- 3%) or in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (1 +/- 1%). A higher concentration of midazolam (100 microM) did enhance recovery when dissolved in DMSO (27 +/- 7%) but not when dissolved in water (5 +/- 2%). To test whether prolonged pretreatment with midazolam dissolved in water would enhance recovery, slices were treated for 30 min prior to anoxia. 
Selective microscopic examination of gallbladders, hernia sacs, and appendices. The usefulness of many "routine" medical procedures is being challenged in the health care atmosphere of today. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of routine microscopic pathologic examination of three frequently submitted surgical specimens. Pathology reports of 39,568 consecutive specimens, 17,105 appendices, 14,654 hernia sacs, and 7,809 gallbladders, submitted over a 49-year period, were reviewed. Microscopic examination of these tissues detected few unexpected findings. In those instances in which unexpected findings were discovered the primary surgery was curative or additional surgery would not have altered the prognosis. When careful, thorough gross examination by the surgeon and pathologist failed to disclose significant abnormalities or confirmed obvious disease such as inflammation, microscopic examination of these tissues might have been eliminated without a change in patient outcome. Although it could be argued that this microscopic pathologic correlation may be helpful for quality control and/or feedback of surgical decision making, the data indicate that gross examination alone may be sufficient in most cases, since unexpected microscopic findings are rare. The indications for microscopic examination of appendices, hernia sacs, and gallbladders are listed. Substantial savings of resources and time may be expected when selective microscopic examination is used. 
Deletions within the pseudoautosomal region help map three new markers and indicate a possible role of this region in linear growth. Short stature is consistently found in individuals with terminal deletions of Xp. In order to refine the localization of a putative locus affecting height, we analyzed two patients with a partial monosomy of the pseudoautosomal region at the molecular level. Eight pseudoautosomal probes were used for the genetic deletion analysis through dose evaluation. Three of them represent new markers (DXS415, DXS419, and DXS406) which were positioned on the pseudoautosomal map by pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Our data suggest that a locus affecting height maps in a region of about 1.5 Mbp, distal to the DXS406 locus and proximal to the DXS415 locus, a region which includes two CpG islands, and rule out an involvement of very distal sequences at the X/Y telomeres. 
Sleep apnea in acromegaly. OBJECTIVE: To provide information on the nature, prevalence, and severity of sleep apnea in patients with acromegaly. DESIGN: Consecutive case series. SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with acromegaly were consecutively referred: 33 patients were referred because of clinical suspicion of sleep apnea and 20 patients were referred without suspected apnea. MEASUREMENTS: Sleep studies as well as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) measurements were done. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (93%; 95% Cl, 85% to 100%) referred because of suspicion of sleep apnea had sleep apnea compared with 12 patients (60%; Cl, 37% to 83%) referred without suspected sleep apnea. Patients with sleep apnea did not have biochemical evidence of increased disease activity (random growth hormone, 12.7 +/- 4.4 micrograms/L; mean growth hormone at 24-hour sampling, 10.8 +/- 8.4 micrograms/L; IGF-1, 90.0 +/- 7.5 nmol/L) compared with patients without sleep apnea (random growth hormone, 14.2 +/- 4.9 micrograms/L, P greater than 0.2; mean growth hormone, 12.4 +/- 3.5 micrograms/L, P greater than 0.2; IGF-1, 90.0 +/- 10.0 nmol/L, P greater than 0.2). Central sleep apnea was the predominant type of apnea in 33% (Cl, 18% to 47%) of patients and was associated with higher random growth hormone and IGF-1 levels than was obstructive apnea (random growth hormone, 23.4 +/- 3.9 compared with 8.8 +/- 3.1 micrograms/L, P less than 0.001; IGF-1, 126 +/- 17.5 compared with 72.5 +/- 7.5 nmol/L, P less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is common in acromegaly. The rate of central sleep apnea was unexpectedly high in patients with acromegaly, and biochemical evidence of increased disease activity was associated with the presence of central apnea rather than with the degree of sleep apnea. Altered respiratory control is a possible mechanism producing sleep apnea in acromegaly. 
Paraganglioma of urethra. Paraganglioma of the urethra is a rare tumor; only 4 cases have been reported previously. We report a fifth case of urethral paraganglioma and review the literature. 
Localization of metallothionein in hair follicles of normal skin and the basal cell layer of hyperplastic epidermis: possible association with cell proliferation. Metallothionein is a low-molecular-weight metal-binding protein. Although it is inducible by a variety of agents and ubiquitously present in many tissues, its physiologic functions are still not clear. The present study was undertaken to determine the possible functions of metallothionein in both the proliferation and differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. Metallothionein was detected immunohistochemically in hair matrix cells of the bulb and cells of the outer root sheath of anagen hair follicles, but not in dermal papillae in normal skin in the back of mice. In hyperplastic epidermal tissue, induced by either a phorbol ester tumor promoter or cholera toxin, the basal cells of the interfollicular epidermis stained strongly for metallothionein. Elevated expression of mRNA of the metallothionein gene was also demonstrated when the skin was stimulated by agents that induced hyperplasia. Papillomas produced by two-stage carcinogenesis protocols also stained for metallothionein. These observations suggest that metallothionein is involved in the proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes. 
Hemostatic wrapping of ruptured liver in two postpartum patients. A variety of surgical techniques with variable success rates have been reported in the management of the spontaneously ruptured liver in pregnancy. We managed two cases of postpartum ruptured liver by wrapping the liver in hemostatic material. Hemostatic encapsulation effectively controlled massive bleeding of ruptured livers in two postpartum patients. 
Middle ear adenoma: tumour of mixed mucinous and neuroendocrine differentiation. Two cases of progressive hearing loss due to middle ear tumours are described. The histological characteristics numbered intraluminal mucin production and neuroendocrine features, as shown by argyrophilia and ultrastructural demonstration of dense core granules. These tumours have been known by many different names, reflecting the controversies relating to their presumed histogenesis and differentiation. The currently preferred designation is middle ear adenoma, and these two cases provide further evidence for dual lines of differentiation. 
Suture technique affects perianastomotic colonic crypt cell production and tumour formation. Suture line recurrence is an important cause of failure after potentially curative resection for colonic carcinoma. Our aim was to determine whether suture technique affected the incidence of perianastomotic tumours in experimentally induced colonic cancer. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups. A 1 cm longitudinal colotomy was repaired with four interrupted 6/0 polypropylene monofilament sutures, using either a transmural technique (n = 18) or a seromuscular technique (n = 18). Control animals (n = 18) had a sham laparotomy. All animals received nine, weekly, subcutaneous injections of azoxymethane (total dose 90 mg/kg) starting 6 weeks after laparotomy. Surviving animals were killed 32 weeks after laparotomy. Five animals from each group were given intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine (100 mg/kg) 1 h before being killed. At death, perianastomotic tumours occurred more frequently in animals with transmural sutures than in either controls or those with seromuscular sutures. This difference was associated with a greater mucosal bromodeoxyuridine crypt cell labelling index in the transmural suture group. We conclude that a transmural anastomotic suture technique promotes the development of experimental perianastomotic colonic tumours. 
Recurrent deletion in the human antithrombin III gene. Eight unrelated patients with recurrent thromboembolism, a family history of thrombosis, and plasma antithrombin III (ATIII) activity/antigen levels consistent with a diagnosis of heterozygous type I ATIII deficiency were studied by polymerase chain reaction/direct sequencing of ATIII gene exon-coding regions. Frameshift mutations of one base and two bases, respectively, were found to have occurred in two unrelated patients at the same GAG codon (Glu 245) within exon 4 of the ATIII gene. A literature search showed six further hitherto unrecognized deletion "hotspots" in four other human genes. These deletion-prone sites exhibited sufficient sequence homology with each other to derive a consensus sequence (T G A/G A/G G A/C), suggesting that deletion in human genes may not only be non-random but also sequence-directed. 
Detection of polyadenylated RNA in hepatitis B virus-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells by polymerase chain reaction. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a reverse transcriptase step characterized a specific transcription activity in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in two patients (1 and 2) with chronic hepatitis positive for antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (HBc). Patient 1 was also coinfected with human hepatitis delta virus. A patient who cleared HBV replication after antiviral treatment with vidarabine served as negative control. HBV-specific RNA poly A sequences were detected by PCR in PBMC of patients 1 and 2 even without detectable HBV DNA (patient 2) as shown by dot blot and PCR assays. RNA sequences were found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. The demonstration of HBV mRNA sequences within PBMC suggests the transcription of viral DNA, in agreement with the findings of HBV surface antigen in PBMC. The results in patient 1 demonstrated HBV mRNA sequences in leukocytes even without PCR-detectable HBV DNA sequences, likely due to ongoing hepatitis delta virus replication. 
Gold weight lid load as a secondary procedure. This paper discusses the use of gold weight lid load as a secondary procedure. By using three representative patients, I emphasize the following points: First, the dominance of the eye must be determined so that postoperative changes in the eyelid height can be anticipated. Second, in order to obtain an accurate weight of the implant needed, the restrictive effect on the eyelid from the previous surgery (a tarsorrhaphy or an encircling band) must first be eliminated. Third, to ensure the best result and the patient's comfort, lacrimal function, Bell's phenomenon, and levator function must be assessed. 
Effect of intracoronary diltiazem on infarct size and regional myocardial function in the ischemic reperfused canine heart This study was designed to investigate whether intracoronary diltiazem given before reperfusion could enhance myocardial salvage in the canine heart. Twenty-five dogs were subjected to 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion. The dogs were assigned to one of three experimental groups. The early diltiazem group received intracoronary diltiazem into the distal coronary bed at the onset of coronary occlusion and for 60 min after reperfusion. The late diltiazem group received the same amount of drug beginning 15 min before reperfusion and the control group received saline solution for 90 min of occlusion and 60 min of reperfusion. Infarct size expressed as a percent of the area at risk was significantly smaller in the early and late diltiazem groups (15.6 +/- 3.6% and 21.2 +/- 5.1%, respectively) than in the control group (49 +/- 4.6%) (p less than 0.05). Intracoronary diltiazem restored systolic function of the stunned, previously ischemic tissue to essentially normal preocclusion values. Segmental shortening after reperfusion averaged 21.6% in the early diltiazem group versus 0 +/- 1.7% and 7.3 +/- 4% for the control and late diltiazem groups, respectively (p less than 0.05). Low dose intracoronary diltiazem did not alter hemodynamic variables or myocardial blood flow but did improve segmental shortening 2 and 6 h after reperfusion. These data indicate that intracoronary diltiazem given during occlusion or just before reperfusion increases the salvage of myocardium compared with the salvage achieved by reperfusion alone. These results also suggest that intracoronary diltiazem given during the ischemic period enhances systolic contractile function of postischemic stunned myocardium. 
Influence of the site of tumor growth on the capacity of a low tumorigenic line of Friend erythroleukemia cells to differentiate. Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) passaged in mice are highly tumorigenic and multiply extensively in the livers of suckling DBA/2 mice without differentiating. In contrast, in vitro passaged FLCs injected intravenously were of low tumorigenicity, multiplied to a limited extent in the livers of suckling mice, and underwent marked differentiation from the proerythroblast to the orthochromatic erythroblast stage in the liver. The presence of characteristic C-type virions budding from the cell surface in various stages of erythroid differentiation served as a marker of the injected FLCs. When the same in vitro passaged FLCs that differentiated in the liver were injected subcutaneously in suckling mice, they formed large subcutaneous tumors consisting of sheets of undifferentiated tumor cells. It is concluded that the tumorigenicity of FLCs depended on the site of tumor growth and that there is an inverse correlation between the tumorigenic capacity and the capacity to differentiate. 
Gallstone fragmentation during biliary lithotripsy: effect of stone composition and structure. In vitro lithotripsy with the Siemens Lithostar was conducted on 36 radiolucent or minimally calcified gallstones housed in an anthropomorphic phantom. The ease and pattern of fragmentation were correlated with global composition for the entire stone, regional or microcomposition (determined by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy), and microstructure (determined by scanning electron microscopy). Stones made up of more than 62% cholesterol required 50% more shock waves to pulverize all fragments to 0.3 cm or less than did stones of less than 62% cholesterol (p less than .01). An inverse relationship was found between the number of shock waves needed for fragmentation and the cholesterol content (r = .77). Although a broad range of fragmentation responses occurred, little variation was seen in the ease of fragmentation within stone families. The majority of stones fractured along radially oriented cholesterol plates, but one third of stones treated showed initial chipping or flaking at the periphery before radial fracture. This type of peripheral erosion most often occurred in stones with peripheral pigment rims. These stones required more shock waves and lagged in pulverization compared with more homogeneous cholesterol stones. The efficiency of fragmentation during biliary lithotripsy correlates with the stones' global cholesterol content. A stone's architecture, as reflected by its regional composition and microstructure, partially predicts the mechanism of fragmentation. These in vitro data may be useful in further refining criteria for selecting patients and understanding the fragmentation process. 
Prognostic value of raised prostatic acid phosphatase and negative skeletal scintigraphy in prostatic cancer. Of 438 consecutive cases of newly diagnosed prostate cancer, 178 (41%) had skeletal metastases (T0-4 M1) at the time of diagnosis according to skeletal scintigraphy; 139 men had serum prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) greater than twice the upper limit of normal on 2 separate occasions at the time of diagnosis and 65% of them had metastases on bone scan. However, 49 men with normal bone scans were found to have similarly raised serum PAP. (Such patients are defined as having skeletal metastases in the current Medical Research Council immediate versus deferred orchiectomy study and stratified accordingly). The actuarial survival of this group was calculated by life table methods and was compared with that of 2 other subgroups: those patients having metastases demonstrated on bone scan, and those patients having both normal bone scans and normal serum PAP. The survival of the "metastatic by acid phosphatase" group was significantly better than that of the "metastatic by bone scan" group but did not differ from that of patients having both normal scans and PAP. For patients with no scintigraphic evidence of skeletal metastases at diagnosis, those with a raised PAP were at a significantly greater risk of scan conversion, although this was more powerfully predicted by high histological grade. 
Cancer occurrence in a cohort of patients surgically treated for peptic ulcer. A cohort of 4107 patients treated surgically for peptic ulcer between 1955 and 1960 was followed up to determine the incidence of cancer by record linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. A total of 930 cases of cancer were observed during 76,634 person-years. Relative risks of cancer were computed by comparison with the recorded cancer incidence in the Danish population. During the first five years after surgery the relative risk of gastric cancer was slightly increased (RR = 1.43), but 5-15 years after the operation the risk was lower than expected (RR = 0.55). Thereafter, the relative risk of gastric cancer increased steadily and increased more than twofold after 25 years. Lung cancer occurred more frequently in the cohort members than expected (RR = 1.66), but the relative risk was independent of time since surgery. Malignancies other than gastric cancer and cancers related to tobacco smoking were close to the expected numbers. The results do not support the findings of a recent British study of similar size in which increased risks were reported for cancer at other sites. 
Proteinase trapping: screening for viral proteinase mutants by alpha complementation. Many virally encoded proteinases cleave themselves out of a polyprotein, with cleavage occurring usually at their own N terminus. This property was used to develop an in vivo screening system using the lacZ gene fragment of M13mp18. When a fusion protein of the alpha fragment of beta-galactosidase and an active 2A proteinase of human rhinovirus 2 was expressed, alpha complementation was not affected, as the 2A proteinase cleaved itself off the alpha fragment. However, fusion of an inactive 2A prevented alpha complementation, as the 2A polypeptide remained fused to the alpha fragment. After random mutation of the 2A gene by PCR amplification, mutants were screened; M13 phage defective in alpha complementation were obtained at an efficiency of 5% and were shown to contain mutated 2A genes. Intermolecular cleavage was then examined by expressing an alpha fragment-inactive proteinase fusion protein as substrate for an active 2A proteinase expressed from an M13 vector. alpha complementation indicated intermolecular processing of the 2A cleavage site on the alpha fragment-inactive proteinase fusion protein. This versatile system thus allows the high-density screening of both active and inactive proteinase mutants, cleaving either intramolecularly or intermolecularly, and should be applicable to other proteinases of high specificity. 
Excimer laser ablation of fibrocartilage: an in vitro and in vivo study. To date, lasers have found only limited applications in orthopedics. We employed a 308 nm XeCl excimer laser for ablation of fibrocartilage, in order to investigate the feasibility of excimer laser assisted meniscectomy. Experiments were conducted both in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro study, human menisci, obtained during surgery and autopsy, were irradiated via a 600 microns core fiber at radiant exposures ranging between 20 mj/mm2 and 80 mj/mm2, at 20 Hz. Ablation rate measurements and histological analysis of the samples were performed. The ablation rates were found to range from 3 microns/pulse to 100 microns/pulse depending on the radiant exposure and/or the applied pressure on the fiber delivery system. Thermographic analysis was also performed during pulsed excimer as well as CW Nd:Yag and CW CO2 laser irradiation. Temperatures were lower for excimer laser (Tmax less than 65 degrees) than CW ND: Yag (Tmax less than 210 degrees) or CW CO2 (Tmax less than 202 degrees) laser. For the in vitro study, medial meniscectomy was performed in 15 rabbits with the excimer laser and a CW Nd:Yag laser in the right and left knee respectively. Excimer laser irradiation was performed at 70 mj/mm2. Nd:Yag irradiation was performed via a 600 microns core fiber at power outputs between 20 to 40 W for 10 and 20 seconds duration. The healing response to injury was investigated by histological analysis of the menisci after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks following the laser procedure. Excimer laser treated menisci showed less inflammatory reaction and noticeable repair with minimal inflammatory response. 
Palliation of malignant tracheal strictures using silicone T tubes. The use of silicone T tubes for intubation of malignant tracheobronchial strictures may provide some degree of palliation of this distressing condition. It was used in seven patients with malignant lesions and two with benign strictures (resulting from tracheal trauma and lung transplantation). Four patients (two with cancer) are still alive and well with the tube in position. All patients noted improvement in dyspnoea and stridor. The main problems were tube migration (one patient), tracheo-oesophageal fistula (one patient), and blockage of the tube by tumour (two patients) or encrusted secretions (three patients). Airway patency was restored when the tube was blocked by cleaning or by laser resection of the tumour. With careful supervision and education of the patient intubation can give useful palliation to patients with distressing upper airways obstruction. 
The effect of intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin therapy on the upper urinary tract. A total of 66 patients with low grade, low stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder who were treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) underwent cystourethrography to detect vesicoureteral reflux. BCG was instilled weekly for 6 weeks and monthly thereafter for up to 24 months. Whenever vesicoureteral reflux was found or morphological abnormalities were detected on excretory urography (IVP) an isotope renal scan was performed to evaluate the relative renal function. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 13 patients (19.7%): 10 had grades 1 and 2A, and 3 had grade 2B reflux. The number of BCG instillations ranged from 8 to 22. IVPs were normal in 11 patients. In 2 patients mild unilateral dilatation was present before BCG instillations, and this remained unchanged during and after therapy. None of the 13 patients with vesicoureteral reflux had IVP features suggestive of urinary tuberculosis. In 11 patients the refluxing renal systems had normal relative renal function (50 to 55%). Two patients had a decrease to 40% of the relative renal function with normal IVPs, suggesting a nonBCG related cause. We conclude that BCG therapy is safe in patients with minimal reflux. 
Intraoperative evaluation of intestinal ischemia: a comparison of methods. Methods for evaluating intestinal ischemia include standard clinical criteria, Doppler ultrasonography, and intravenous fluorescein injection. Each has disadvantages, and a combination of methods is often used. The purpose of this study was to determine whether surface oximetry could be used to assess perfusion in an animal whose intestinal diameter approximates that of infants. Reversible arterial, venous, and arteriovenous occlusion was studied in rabbit intestines. After 6 to 8 hours of occlusion, intestinal vascularity was evaluated by the four methods listed. Doppler ultrasonography and surface oximetry were found to be unreliable tools for assessing perfusion in this animal model. We conclude that standard clinical criteria and fluorescein remain the standards for intraoperative evaluation of intestinal perfusion.
