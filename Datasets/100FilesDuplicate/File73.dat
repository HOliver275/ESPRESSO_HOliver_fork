Piezoelectric biliary lithotripsy: an in vitro study of factors affecting gallstone fragmentation. Factors affecting the fragmentation of gallstones with piezoelectric lithotripsy were studied in vitro, with a goal of providing data that will help direct treatment with piezoelectric lithotriptors. Two hundred fifty-seven stones from 50 patients were treated with the EDAP LT.O1 lithotriptor until all fragments measured 2 mm or less in diameter. The fragmentation process was observed, and two patterns were evident: central fragmentation and peripheral chipping. The majority of stones fragmented centrally. Fragmentation characteristics in different stones from the same patient were compared with those from different patients. Stone diameter, shock-wave frequency and power, and CT appearance were examined and correlated with fragmentation. Gallstones from the same patient showed uniform fragmentation patterns and consistent relationships between fragmentation time and gallstone size, shock-wave frequency, and power. In stones from the same patient, gallstone size had a marked effect on fragmentation time, which correlated with the cube of the stone diameter, and shock-wave frequency and power had a proportional inverse linear relationship with fragmentation time. When controlling for stone size and treatment parameters, stones from multiple patients showed marked differences in fragmentation time, and because of this, poor correlation between stone size and fragmentation time. Stones grouped according to CT pattern and attenuation showed wide variation and no correlation between CT characteristics and fragmentation pattern or fragmentation time. Our results show that a great variability exists in fragmentation time of gallstones, making it impossible to accurately predict fragmentation time at a given stone size. Only rough estimates of longer fragmentation times with increasing stone size can be made. The linear relationships between shock-wave frequency or power and fragmentation time allow one to easily predict the effect of manipulating these variables and to tailor treatment to each patient's tolerance. Finally, CT appearance does not appear to be predictive of fragmentation outcome. 
Prospects for the use of antagonists to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor to prevent post-angioplasty restenosis and thrombosis. Despite many advances since its inception in humans in 1977, coronary angioplasty continues to be limited by the problems of abrupt arterial closure and late restenosis. Excessive platelet deposition at the site of angioplasty undoubtedly plays an important role in the pathophysiology of both of these problems. Monoclonal antibodies and snake venom-derived or synthetic peptides directed against a common protein recognition sequence on the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor are currently in the early stages of preclinical and clinical testing and hold promise of preventing abrupt closure and restenosis by inhibiting platelet function. Whether any of these agents will eventually be commonly used in clinical practice will depend on their effects on the complex pathophysiology of these problems and on their safety profile when administered to patients who are likely to receive other antithrombotic medications and who are instrumented for coronary angioplasty. 
Muscle damage induced by eccentric contractions of 25% strain. Contractile and morphological properties were measured in the rabbit tibialis anterior muscle 1 h after isometric contraction (IC), passive stretch (PS), or eccentric contraction (EC). Maximal tetanic tension (Po) was reduced after 30 min of PS (P less than 0.001), IC (P less than 0.001), or EC (P less than 0.0001). However, the magnitude of the force deficit was a function of the treatment method. After 30 min of cyclic PS, Po decreased by 13%, whereas after IC or EC, Po decreased by 31 and 69%, respectively. The time course of tension decline in the various groups suggested that the EC-induced injury occurred during the first few minutes of treatment. Although the morphology of samples from the PS and IC groups appeared normal, eccentrically exercised muscles exhibited portions of abnormally large fibers (diam greater than or equal to 110 microns) when viewed in cross section. Examination of 231 such fibers from 6 muscles revealed that all enlarged fibers were exclusively of the fast-twitch glycolytic fiber type. Although no ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in any of the muscles from the IC or PS groups, a significant portion of the fibers in the EC group displayed various degrees of disorganization of the sarcomeric band pattern. Taken together, these studies highlight the importance of fiber oxidative capacity in EC-induced injury, which may be related to the damage mechanism. 
Diaphragmatic performance during recovery from acute ventilatory failure in Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis. Diaphragmatic muscle performance during acute ventilatory failure due to Guillain-Barre syndrome and myasthenia gravis was assessed to evaluate (1) diaphragmatic function during weaning from ventilatory support and (2) diaphragmatic tension-time integral (TTdi) during ventilatory failure. We used a multilumen nasogastric tube and a pneumotachograph to measure transdiaphragmatic pressure per breath (Pdi), maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdimax), tidal volume (VT), and inspiratory time fraction during 74 spontaneous breathing trials in nine patients. Diaphragmatic performance was poor in all patients. The Pdi, Pdimax, and VT improved significantly, but values for Pdi and Pdimax remained low even after weaning. Improvement in Pdimax was the best predictor of recovery (r = 0.48; p less than 0.001). Maximal inspiratory force correlated with Pdimax (r = 0.48; p less than 0.005), but FVC did not. The TTdi rarely exceeded the expected fatigue threshold of 0.15 in spite of the patient's inability to sustain ventilation. Although our patients demonstrated diaphragmatic weakness, TTdi did not demonstrate diaphragmatic fatigue. 
Cavernomas of the central nervous system: clinical and neuroimaging manifestations in 47 patients. Forty seven cases of central nervous system cavernous angioma (21 males and 26 females) are described. The main clinical signs were epilepsy and brainstem syndromes. Digital subtraction intra-arterial angiography, when used, failed to reveal cavernoma. CT detected many of the lesions, but the most successful supplementary diagnostic procedure was MRI which produces highly characteristic images of cavernous angioma. The diagnosis of cavernous angioma was confirmed in the 18 cases in which the tumour was removed surgically. 
A new approach to the resection of pulmonary osteosarcoma metastases. Results of aggressive metastasectomy. Pulmonary metastases are the primary cause of death from bone and soft-tissue sarcoma. Recognition that even multiple resections of metastases can improve survival has led to a more aggressive surgical approach to these patients. The authors instituted an aggressive approach and a new technique and retrospectively analyzed the results of multiple, pulmonary metastasectomies for pulmonary metastases in 34 patients, 21 of whom had osteogenic sarcoma (OGS). A number of cases were referred from other institutions, where they had been considered inoperable because of extensive or recurrent disease. Using lateral thoracotomies, laser technique with minimal parenchymal excision, and thin gloves for palpation, aggressive metastectomy was carried out. A mean of 3.1 thoracotomies were performed, with an average of 10.6 nodules resected per thoracotomy. Operative morbidity and mortality were minimal. Evaluation of potential prognostic factors revealed no statistically significant survival difference on the basis of disease-free interval (DFI), number of nodules resected, number of thoracotomies, or size of largest nodule resected. There was a clear trend toward decreased survival of patients with larger nodules (greater than 2 cm), but because of the small number of patients in this group, no firm conclusions can be drawn. Five-year survival was 49% for the study group as a whole, and 39% for the OGS patients. Aggressive surgical resection of pulmonary metastases from bone and soft-tissue sarcoma should be considered when there is control of local disease, no evidence of extrapulmonary metastasis, and adequate postresection pulmonary reserve. The presence of bilateral, extensive, or recurrent disease is not a contraindication to thoracotomy. 
Adult chronic lead intoxication. A clinical review. A stained-glass artisan with depression and a retired junkyard worker with congestive cardiomyopathy had increased mobilizable body burdens of lead by calcium ethylenediaminetetaacetic acid testing. Although both patients improved with several months of intramuscular chelation therapy, the efficacy of such therapy in chronic lead poisoning is controversial. Recognition of unusual manifestations of chronic lead poisoning may at least interrupt further exposure, even if specific therapy is not undertaken. 
Translaminar facet joint screw fixation for lumbar and lumbosacral fusion. A clinical and biomechanical study. Various systems of supplementing bone grafts with internal fixation in the lumbosacral spine have been used in an effort to improve fusion rates. This study reports biomechanical data of cyclic loading cadaveric spines instrumented with translaminar facet screws as well as early clinical results on this technique. Static loading tests comparing uninstrumented and instrumented spinal motion units show that a ninefold increase in flexion load is necessary for constant displacement after facet screw fixation. Repetitive loading tests show only a small decrease in stiffness of instrumented segments even after 5,000 cycles. To date, 35 patients have undergone fusion by this technique as performed by one surgeon. After excluding Workers' Compensation cases and cases with less than 2 years follow-up, there were 18 cases available for review. Twelve of these 18 cases were two-level fusions. Ten patients underwent concomitant discectomy or nerve root decompression. There were no cases of iatrogenic neurologic injury or pseudoarthrosis. It is concluded that translaminar facet screws have a sound biomechanical basis and are a valuable addition to lumbar fusion procedures. 
Autoantibodies to the presumptive cytoplasmic domain of platelet glycoprotein IIIa in patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura. Chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder due to autoantibodies against platelets that result in their destruction. In some patients, these autoantibodies bind to platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIIa. With the aim of better defining the antigenic epitopes, plasma from 13 selected patients with chronic ITP known to have anti-GPIIb/IIIa autoantibodies was tested for reactivity with nine synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of the GP IIIa molecule. Of these plasmas, five bound significantly (P less than .001) with either peptide 8 (amino acids 721-744) or peptide 9 (amino acids 742-762), which together form most of the carboxyterminal region presumed to be the cytoplasmic domain. Three of these positive plasmas, were tested further. In two of these positive plasmas, the anti-peptide antibodies represented greater than 80% of the detectable circulating autoantibody. To further evaluate the importance of the carboxyterminal region as an antigenic site, the chronic ITP plasmas were tested against Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with GPIIb and either whole GPIIIa or GPIIIa lacking amino acids 728 to 762. Ten of the 13 plasmas required the presence of this region for significant autoantibody binding. We conclude that the carboxyterminal region is an important area for stimulating antiplatelet autoantibody formation in some patients with chronic ITP. It is not known whether these autoantibodies to the presumed cytoplasmic domain play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease or occur as a secondary phenomenon during the course of platelet destruction. 
Reversible and irreversible elongation of ischemic, infarcted, and healed myocardium in response to increases in preload and afterload. BACKGROUND. Left ventricular aneurysm formation after myocardial infarction (MI) has been associated with elongation of infarcted tissue in response to wall stress. Such elongation most commonly occurs in acutely infarcted or partially healed regions during the early post-MI period; however, recent reports have indicated that mature (15-week-old) healed infarct regions also undergo elongation after stress. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess factors contributing to post-MI left ventricular aneurysm formation, we subjected isolated strips (n = 50) of rabbit myocardial tissue from acutely ischemic (noninfarcted left ventricular), acutely infarcted (24 hours after MI), and healed infarct (3 and 15 weeks after MI) regions to a range of loading conditions and measured the reversible and irreversible length changes that occurred. The isolated strips were repetitively stretched for 1 hour at 4 Hz to impose cyclical physiological peak and resting stresses of 2.0 and 0.2 g/mm2. During a second hour, either peak stress ("afterload") or resting stress ("preload") was tripled, and the increase in strip length (strain) was measured. During a third hour, peak and resting stresses were returned to the initial values to assess the reversibility of length changes occurring during increased load. Elongation was expressed as the increase in natural strain from the first hour. Increasing afterload caused similar irreversible length increases of 4-5%/hr in acutely infarcted and 3- and 15-week-old healed infarct strips; acutely ischemic tissue length increased by 7.4%/hr (p less than 0.05 versus acutely infarcted tissue and scars). Increasing preload in acutely ischemic and acutely infarcted tissue caused a reversible length increase of less than 1%/hr. (Scar strips were not tested for the effect of preload.) CONCLUSIONS. Since an irreversible length increase may represent an early event in aneurysm formation, our results suggest that 1) afterload increases are more likely to lead to aneurysm development than preload increases, 2) acutely ischemic tissue is the most vulnerable to increased afterload, and 3) for a given wall stress level, healing scar tissue is as susceptible to irreversible length changes as is acutely infarcted tissue. The observation that even mature post-MI scar elongated in response to increases in afterload implies that long-term pharmacological management of afterload in post-MI patients may be beneficial in preventing tissue elongation and aneurysm formation and that factors that increase wall stress (e.g., hypertension and exercise stress) have the potential to promote aneurysm formation in healed infarct scars. 
Status epilepticus in benign rolandic epilepsy manifesting as anterior operculum syndrome. We report the fourth case of partial status epilepticus (SE) in benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes (BECRS). The child suffered long-lasting attacks involving the mouth and pharynx, clinically manifest as speech arrest, sialorrhea, and drooling. Both clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were compatible with the diagnosis of BECRS. Only during SE was the clinical picture similar to that observed in the operculum or Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome. SE remission was obtained with the usual antiepileptic drug therapy (diazepam, clobazam, valproate). EEG records showed additional patterns of continuous spike-waves during slow sleep and specific inhibition and blocking of interictal centrotemporal spikes by mouth and/or tongue voluntary movements. 
Differences in electrophysiological substrate in patients with coronary artery disease and cardiac arrest or ventricular tachycardia. Insights from endocardial mapping and signal-averaged electrocardiography. BACKGROUND. Many studies have combined patients with hemodynamically well-tolerated ventricular tachycardia (VT) and those with cardiac arrest (CA) as a single, homogenous group. Recent studies suggest that these two groups have different electrophysiological substrates and responses to therapy. Most of these studies, however, enrolled patients with a variety of cardiac diagnoses. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) and endocardial catheter mapping to define the electrophysiological substrate in patients with coronary artery disease and VT or CA and correlate the results of the two methods. We also examined the usefulness of SAECG in CA patients to differentiate those with inducible arrhythmias from those who are noninducible. VT patients were more likely to have had a prior myocardial infarction (p = 0.0005) and to have inducible arrhythmias (p = 0.0001) than were CA patients. The induced arrhythmias in patients who presented with VT was VT in more than 90% of cases, whereas in CA patients, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT) accounted for one third of induced arrhythmias. Mean filtered QRS duration was longer (135 versus 120 msec) and the terminal QRS voltage was smaller (20 versus 34 microV) in VT than in CA patients (p less than 0.01). Sixty-three percent of CA patients and 87% of VT patients had abnormal SAECG (p = 0.001). VT patients had more extensive endocardial abnormalities and more abnormal (53% versus 40%, p = 0.002), fractionated (8% versus 3%, p = 0.02), late (17% versus 8%, p = 0.0003), and late abnormal or fractionated (14% versus 4%, p = 0.0001) sites than CA patients. VT patients had a greater duration of the longest electrogram (129 versus 109 msec, p = 0.0006) and total endocardial activation time (68 versus 54 msec, p = 0.009). Among CA patients, those with induced VT had more extensive substrate than did those with induced PMVT and were similar to VT patients with induced VT. Among CA patients, the trend for more patients with inducible VT (77%) or PMVT (55%) than noninducible patients (47%) to have an abnormal SAECG did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.14). The positive and negative predictive values of an abnormal SAECG were 77% and 44%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. VT patients have more extensive endocardial substrate than CA patients, which translates into greater and more frequent SAECG abnormalities. Among CA patients, there are significant differences in substrate between patients with induced VT and those with induced PMVT. SAECG is not useful in differentiating CA patients who have inducible VT or PMVT from those who do not. 
Long-term spinal administration of morphine in cancer and non-cancer pain: a retrospective study. Records of 313 patients who had been treated with spinal morphine via an implanted Port-A-Cath were reviewed. In 284 cases the Port-A-Cath was implanted for epidural delivery of morphine in patients with cancer-related pain. These patients were treated for a mean of 96 (range 1-1215) days. There was a wide variation in dose requirements, minimum daily dose ranging from 0.5 to 200 mg and maximum daily dose from 1 to 3072 mg. However, there was no clear trend to increasing dose as period of epidural morphine administration increased. The most frequent complications were pain on injection (12.0% incidence), occlusion of the portal system (10.9%), infection (8.1%) and leakage of administered morphine such that it did not all reach the epidural space (2.1%). In all but 1 case infections were limited to the area around the portal or along the catheter track. All infections resolved without sequelae following removal of the portal and/or administration of antibiotics. In 17 patients Port-A-Caths were implanted for the intrathecal delivery of morphine to control cancer-related pain. These patients also exhibited wide variations in morphine dose requirements. Port-A-Caths were also implanted for delivery of spinal morphine in 12 patients with chronic pain which was not related to cancer and which failed to respond to other therapies. These patients were treated for a mean of 155 (range 2-575) days. Port-A-Caths were removed from 7 of these patients, primarily due to infection (2 cases) and inadequate pain relief and pain on injection (2 cases). 
Ureteral pseudodiverticula: frequent association with uroepithelial malignancy. Ureteral pseudodiverticula are tiny outpouchings usually seen as incidental findings on retrograde urography during routine work-up for common urinary tract disorders. We report 37 patients with ureteral pseudodiverticula, of whom 17 (46%) had associated uroepithelial malignancy. Ureteral pseudodiverticula were diagnosed in all patients on excretory or retrograde urography as an incidental finding during evaluation for a variety of urologic symptoms and signs. All patients were assessed with urinalysis, urine culture, cystoscopy, and when indicated, ureteroscopy. Diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was made by surgery or endoscopic biopsy in 16 patients and squamous cell carcinoma in one. In nine patients with radiographs showing ureteral pseudodiverticula and a urinary tract filling defect (usually in the bladder), 78% of the cases were proved malignant. In six patients with ureteral pseudodiverticula and a stricture in the ureter or renal collecting system, 67% of the cases were proved malignant. Of the patients with tumor, 53% had a single ureteral pseudodiverticulum. In two cases, the pseudodiverticula antedated the diagnosis of malignancy by 2 and 4 years, respectively. Our experience suggests that the association between ureteral pseudodiverticula and uroepithelial malignancy may be more common than previously assumed, approaching 50%. Even a single ureteral pseudodiverticulum should be regarded as a serious marker for potential malignancy, antedating cancer by 2-10 years, and such patients should be closely followed up. The coexistence of ureteral pseudodiverticula and a stricture or filling defect in the urinary tract is highly suggestive that a tumor is present. 
Omenn's syndrome and related combined immunodeficiency syndromes: diagnostic considerations in infants with persistent erythroderma and failure to thrive. A 4-month-old male infant had a 2-month history of an exfoliative erythroderma and alopecia. Recurrent mucosal infections, diffuse lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphocytosis and eosinophilia, anemia, and failure to thrive later developed. Investigation revealed a combined immunodeficiency with T cells of an unusual phenotype in his peripheral blood, skin, and lymph nodes. Our patient's clinical manifestations most closely resemble Omenn's syndrome, a rare form of autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency. 
Benefits of implantable defibrillators are overestimated by sudden death rates and better represented by the total arrhythmic death rate Benefits of the implantable defibrillator on survival were studied in 56 consecutive patients (concomitant coronary bypass or arrythmia surgery in 15) during an 8 year period between 1982 and 1990. During a follow-up period of 29 +/- 25 months, six patients had a sudden death and eight patients had a nonsudden cardiac death. Nonsudden cardiac deaths included three surgical deaths (death within 30 days after the surgery; two in patients without and one in a patient with concomitant cardiac surgery), one arrhythmia-related nonsudden death (death within 24 h after an arrhythmic event despite initial termination of the arrhythmia by the implantable defibrillators) and four nonarrhythmic cardiac deaths. The actuarial survival rate free of events at 1, 2 and 3 years was 96%, 96% and 92%, respectively, for sudden death, 91%, 91% and 87% for sudden death and surgical mortality and 89%, 89% and 85% for total arrhythmic death (sudden death, surgical mortality and arrhythmia-related nonsudden death). Thus, in patients treated with an implantable defibrillator, 1) the rate of sudden death is low (8% at 3 years); 2) 50% of nonsudden cardiac deaths are causally related to arrhythmia (surgical mortality or arrhythmia-related nonsudden death); 3) the total arrhythmic death rate is substantially higher than the sudden death rate; and 4) benefits of an implantable defibrillator are overestimated by reported sudden death and nonsudden cardiac death rates. The benefits may be better represented by the total arrhythmic death and nonarrhythmic cardiac death rates. 
Experience with laser-assisted balloon angioplasty and a rotary angioplasty instrument: lessons learned. Favorable early results with mechanical angioplasty devices and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty have resulted in aggressive marketing and a rapid increase in the use of these devices for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive disease. Recent reports, however, have questioned the durability of these less invasive procedures. Since 1986 we have been involved in the clinical investigation of the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. One hundred two balloon angioplasty procedures assisted by the Nd:YAG laser (n = 56) and the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument (n = 46) were performed for the treatment of femoropopliteal occlusive lesions. Both Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument and laser-assisted balloon angioplasty groups were similar with regard to age, operative indication, preoperative ankle-brachial index, lesion length, and distal runoff. Mean follow-up was 19 months in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 15 months in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. Technically successful recanalization was achieved in 67% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 82% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Early hemodynamic and clinical improvement was obtained in 59% of Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures and 57% of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures. Two-year clinical success by life-table analysis was 37% in the Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument group and 19% in the laser-assisted balloon angioplasty group. The level of subsequent surgical revascularization was not altered in any patient by Kensey dynamic angioplasty instrument-assisted balloon angioplasty or laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. 
Methodologic issues in maintenance therapy clinical trials. In the early 1980s, the National Institute of Mental Health supported a multicenter, randomized, controlled, clinical trial on unipolar and bipolar disorder to evaluate the comparative efficacies of lithium carbonate, imipramine hydrochloride, a lithium-imipramine combination, and placebo in preventing the recurrence of affective disorders. The objective of this report is to present a reanalysis of the relative efficacies of these treatments in patients with unipolar disorder to focus attention on general issues related to the design and conduct of maintenance therapy trials. We show that the earlier conclusions of that study that imipramine and the combination therapy are more effective than lithium and placebo in preventing the recurrence of depression in unipolar patients can be accounted for by alternative explanations that are a consequence of the design of the study. Our findings have important implications for the design, conduct, and interpretation of results of maintenance therapy clinical trials in general. 
Effects of immunosuppressive therapy in biopsy-proved myocarditis and borderline myocarditis on left ventricular function. Twenty patients with decreased left ventricular (LV) function and endomyocardial biopsy-proved myocarditis (9 patients) or borderline myocarditis (11 patients) were studied to determine whether these 2 histologic subsets of patients with inflammatory heart disease differed in their response to a 6- to 8-week course of immunosuppressive therapy. All patients received a regimen of prednisone, 1.0 mg/kg/day, and azathioprine, 1.5 mg/kg/day, followed by repeat endomyocardial biopsy and reevaluation of LV function. LV function improved significantly in the group with borderline myocarditis, as assessed by LV stroke work--end-diastolic volume ratio (0.26 +/- 0.17 to 0.54 +/- 0.31 kg.m.ml-1, p less than 0.02), heart rate corrected velocity of circumferential shortening (0.49 +/- 0.30 to 0.80 +/- 0.29 circ.s-1, p less than 0.05), and LV ejection fraction (0.30 +/- 0.15 to 0.47 +/- 0.13, p less than 0.05). LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volume indexes also decreased significantly from 129 +/- 40 to 94 +/- 38 (p less than 0.05) and 90 +/- 37 to 49 +/- 26 ml (p less than 0.02), respectively. No significant change in these indexes of LV function or volume occurred in the myocarditis group. Whereas salutory improvements in cardiac output and filling pressures were found in both groups, objective improvement in LV function assessed by complementary indexes of contractility was greatest in the borderline myocarditis group. It is concluded that short-term immunosuppressive therapy improves LV contractile function and appears to be associated with regression of ventricular dilatation in patients with borderline myocarditis to a greater extent than patients with myocarditis. 
Monitoring of upper oesophageal sphincter pressure in children. In children technical limitations of upper oesophageal sphincter manometry have restricted investigation to the pull through technique under sedation. In this study we have used an adapted sleeve manometric technique for upper oesophageal sphincter monitoring in unsedated children and determined the influence of the state of arousal on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. Twenty six children aged 3 to 42 months (median 17.5 months), who were referred for evaluation of oesophageal motor function, were studied with dual sleeve manometric assemblies which monitored upper and lower oesophageal sphincter pressures simultaneously. Pharyngeal, oesophageal body, and gastric pressures were also monitored with seven perfused side holes. Recordings were made for four hours after a meal and were technically successful in 24 children. The child's state of arousal was scored every 12th minute as follows: (A) resting, eyes closed, (B) resting, eyes open, (C) moving but comfortable, (D) restless and uncomfortable, (E) crying. In 67% of the 12 minute samples the children showed good adaptation to the procedure (arousal states A to C). There was a highly significant difference in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure between each of the arousal states (p less than 0.0001), being lowest in category A at (mean (SD) 18.1 (10.3) mmHg and highest in category D 55.7 (13.2) mm Hg. Abrupt changes in the state of arousal were associated with equally abrupt changes in upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. The state of arousal of unsedated children has an important influence on upper oesophageal sphincter pressure. It is essential that this factor is controlled for in any studies of upper oesophageal sphincter tone in children. The sleeve technique is capable of monitoring upper oesophageal sphincter motility for prolonged periods in unsedated children. 
Long-term function in University of Cape Town prostheses in the tricuspid position. A 55-year-old woman undergoing triple-valve replacement was found at operation to have a well preserved and functioning University of Cape Town prosthesis that had been inserted 18 years earlier for tricuspid stenosis. Case reporting, valve reappraisal, and factual updating on another case, the world's first documented tricuspid valve replacement for Ebstein's anomaly, are presented. These two remarkable in vivo successes speak well for this historic collar stud valve. 
A simple biological index for detection of alcoholic liver disease in drinkers. To make liver biopsy unnecessary in certain cases, PGA (P, prothrombin time; G, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase; A, apoliprotein AI), a simple biological index combining a specific test for severe liver disease (prothrombin time), a sensitive test of alcoholic liver disease (serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase), and a test for liver fibrosis (serum apolipoprotein AI), was evaluated in a training sample of 333 drinkers and validated in 291 other drinkers. All patients underwent an intercostal liver biopsy, and the specimen was independently read by two pathologists. The PGA index varied from 0 to 12. When PGA was less than or equal to 2, the probability of cirrhosis was 0% and the probability of normal liver or minimal changes 83%. Conversely, when PGA was greater than or equal to 9, the probability of normal liver or minimal changes was 0% and the probability of cirrhosis 86%. These values did not vary between training and validation periods, between asymptomatic vs. symptomatic subjects or between PGA at admission vs. PGA 1 week later. This index could be useful for general practitioners in identifying subjects at high risk for severe alcoholic liver disease. 
Acute fulminant hepatic failure. Fulminant hepatic failure is the rapid onset of life-threatening hepatic decompensation in patients who have no previous history of liver disease. This condition has a multifactorial etiology, including viral hepatitis and drug toxicity. At this time there is no specific therapy for FHF. However, early diagnosis and treatment of the complications--in particular, cerebral edema--may prolong survival and prevent irreversible neurologic complications. Once the diagnosis has been made, patients with FHF should promptly be transferred to a specialized liver care unit where liver transplantation is available. Liver transplantation is now the treatment of choice for patients with clinical characteristics suggesting a poor chance of survival. 
Age-related normal values of signal-averaged electrocardiographic variables after acute myocardial infarction. The study examined standard time domain variables of a signal-averaged electrocardiogram (SAECG) in 328 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. The correlation of these variables with age and the influence of age on the prediction of postinfarction arrhythmic complication (sudden death [n = 12] or sustained ventricular tachycardia, or both [n = 14]) from the SAECG were investigated. Statistically highly significant correlations (p less than or equal to 0.00002) between age and SAECG variables were found. Compared with patients aged less than 60 years, the SAECG-based stratification of arrhythmic complications after myocardial infarction in patients greater than 60 years had lower sensitivity for the same values of specificity and lower specificity for the same values of sensitivity. 
Gallium-SPECT in the detection of prosthetic valve endocarditis and aortic ring abscess. A 52-yr-old man who had a bioprosthetic aortic valve developed Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. Despite antibiotic therapy he had persistent pyrexia and developed new conduction system disturbances. Echocardiography did not demonstrate vegetations on the valve or an abscess, but gallium scintigraphy using SPECT clearly identified a focus of intense activity in the region of the aortic valve. The presence of valvular vegetations and a septal abscess was confirmed at autopsy. Gallium scintigraphy, using SPECT, provided a useful noninvasive method for the demonstration of endocarditis and the associated valve ring abscess. 
Pain in sickle cell disease. Rates and risk factors. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Acute episodes of pain are the principal symptom of sickle cell disease, but little is known about the epidemiologic features of these episodes or risk factors for them, nor is it known whether patients with high rates of such episodes die prematurely. We prospectively studied the natural history of sickle cell disease in 3578 patients ranging from newborns to persons up to 66 years old who were followed at clinical centers across the United States. RESULTS. There were 12,290 episodes of pain in 18,356 patient-years. The average rate was 0.8 episode per patient-year in sickle cell anemia, 1.0 episode per patient-year in sickle beta 0-thalassemia, and 0.4 episode per patient-year in hemoglobin SC disease and sickle beta(+)-thalassemia. The rate varied widely within each of these four groups--e.g., 39 percent of patients with sickle cell anemia had no episodes of pain, and 1 percent had more than six episodes per year. The 5.2 percent of patients with 3 to 10 episodes per year had 32.9 percent of all episodes. Among patients with sickle cell anemia who were more than 20 years old, those with high rates of pain episodes tended to die earlier than those with low rates. High rates were associated with a high hematocrit and low fetal hemoglobin levels. alpha-Thalassemia had no effect on pain apart from its association with an increased hematocrit. CONCLUSIONS. The "pain rate" (episodes per year) is a measure of clinical severity and correlates with early death in patients with sickle cell anemia over the age of 20. Even when the fetal hemoglobin level is low, one can predict that small increments in the level may have an ameliorating effect on the pain rate and may ultimately improve survival. This outcome is particularly encouraging to investigators studying hydroxyurea and other treatments designed to increase the fetal hemoglobin level. 
Clinical findings associated with pulmonary embolism in a rehabilitation setting. In a rehabilitation setting, pulmonary embolism is a relatively frequent and life-threatening complication. Deciding when a patient may be experiencing this condition is difficult, however, because of frequent deficits in patient communication skills (eg, aphasia and cognitive deficits) and the multisystem illnesses affecting many rehabilitation patients. We reviewed the charts of 30 rehabilitation patients transferred emergently during the years 1986 to 1988 with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, which was subsequently documented by ventilation-perfusion scanning. The average age of the 30 patients was 65; 63% were women and 20 (67%) had an admitting diagnosis of stroke. The most common new-onset clinical findings in the 24 hours before discharge were unusual facial skin color changes (pale, flushed, or cyanotic) (57%), chest or upper back pain (47%), tachycardia (heart rate more than 100 bpm) (40%), hypoxemia (arterial oxygen saturation less than or equal to 90%) (40%), and fever less than 101F (37%). In 63% of the patients, either anxiety, restlessness, diaphoresis, or dyspnea was also noted in the 24 hours before discharge. The data suggest that careful physician and nursing scrutiny may identify clinical signs characteristic of pulmonary embolism, and that the de novo appearance of these constellations of findings may help to select candidates for ventilation-perfusion scanning. 
Peritonitis after cecal perforation. An experimental model to study the therapeutic role of antibiotics associated with allopurinol and catalase. This work uses cecal perforation on the rat as a model of intra-abdominal sepsis. Under these conditions, various antibiotics were tested alone or in association with free radical scavengers, such as allopurinol and catalase. It can be concluded that the scavengers were not effective alone, but when combined with antibiotics they rendered good results in the majority of the groups when given postsepsis. Further studies are needed to determine the real role of agents like the free radical scavengers in infectious situations such as the one discussed here. 
Transient corneal opacification induced by cold in Raynaud's disease. A 48-year-old man presented with longstanding complaints of transient blurring of vision on exposure to cold temperatures. A review of family history was noteworthy in that two of the patient's four sons and the patient's brother had similar complaints. All affected individuals had Raynaud's disease. Results of ophthalmic evaluation showed transient corneal opacities. Slit-lamp video photography under cold stress demonstrated conjunctival vascular changes consistent with Raynaud's phenomenon. An extensive work-up for systemic disease was otherwise negative. To the best of the authors' knowledge, anterior segment changes have not been described previously in idiopathic Raynaud's disease. 
Hypopharyngeal lipoma as a cause for sudden asphyxial death. Lipomas of the hypopharynx are uncommon tumors that are rarely life threatening. When positioned in the hypopharynx, asphyxia may be the result of the tumor size or sudden displacement into the oropharynx. We present a case of a large hypopharyngeal lipoma, review the literature, and discuss mechanisms by which these lesions may cause sudden asphyxial death. 
Systematic underreporting of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Massachusetts. Possible implications for national incidence figures. An independent tabulation of incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Massachusetts indicates that 12% and perhaps as many as 19% of new cases of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Massachusetts are not recorded in the Massachusetts Cancer Registry, significantly more than the expected 5% (p = 0.0001). The increasing number of nonhospital medical settings in which melanomas can be diagnosed and/or treated appears to account for this discrepancy. We suspect that these findings in Massachusetts also apply to cancer reporting systems in other regions of the United States. We suggest that the true incidence of cutaneous malignant melanoma in Massachusetts, and perhaps in the United States, may be significantly higher than reported. 
Local anesthesia blocks the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture. The incidence of postoperative illness was monitored for 6 hours in 74 women premedicated with nalbuphine, 10 mg, and undergoing short gynecologic operations of similar duration under methohexitalnitrous oxide-oxygen anesthesia. Each patient received P6 acupuncture for 5 minutes at the time of administration of premedication. In random order the site of the acupuncture had been previously infiltrated with normal saline solution in half of the patients and 1% lidocaine in the remaining patients. Postoperative emetic sequelae occurred significantly more often in those who received lidocaine compared with the group that received saline solution. This demonstrates the ability of a local anesthetic administered at the point of stimulation to block the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture in a manner similar to that shown by others for analgesia. 
The gastropulmonary route of infection--fact or fiction? Published studies relating to whether medicinal stress-bleeding prophylaxis leading to an increase of gastric pH favors the development of bronchopulmonary infections are reviewed. Results from studies in healthy humans, patients with ulcer disease, and patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) clearly show that the risk of gastric bacterial colonization significantly increases relative to increasing gastric pH. Moreover, a drug-induced increase of gastric pH leads directly to gastric bacterial colonization also in patients in the ICU, above all with bacteria typical of the gastrointestinal tract. Comparing the different bacterial spectra of the oropharynx, stomach, and upper small intestine, it becomes clear that the stomach is a reservoir of bacteria independent of the oropharynx and also subject to retrograde colonization due to the duodenogastric reflux. Both by means of microbiological and in particular direct detection procedures, it can be demonstrated that in at least 30-40% of intubated patients a gastropulmonary route of colonization occurs. In patient groups without a medication-induced increase of gastric pH the number of bacteria detected in the tracheal secretion is about 33% less than in the case of conventional stress-bleeding prophylaxis. These findings make it understandable that a highly significant increase in the pneumonia rate is seen in patients receiving pH-increasing stress-bleeding prophylaxis versus control groups without therapy essentially influencing gastric pH. A risk score was developed that allows an easy description of those patients who are at an increased risk of pulmonary infections due to the gastropulmonary route of colonization. 
Improved mammographic accuracy. Use of ancillary imaging studies to evaluate suspicious screening mammograms can improve their positive predictive value for detecting malignant lesions. In 1989 8181 screening mammograms were performed at the breast evaluation center at Memorial Hospital Medical Center in Long Beach. A total of 670 patients were called back for magnification views or ultrasonographic evaluation, and 92 of these patients underwent surgical biopsy. There were 42 cancers diagnosed, yielding an accuracy rate of 46%. 
Complications of diverticular disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a prospective study. Previous retrospective studies have suggested an association between consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the complications of diverticular disease. Ninety-two patients were entered into a prospective study of the complications of diverticular disease over a 3 year period; 31 were taking NSAIDs, compared with only four age- and sex-matched controls from a representative general practice (P less than 0.001). A second control group comprised 306 patients with cancer of the colon in whom NSAID consumption was again significantly lower than in patients with diverticular disease (22 of 306 versus 31 of 92, P less than 0.001). Of the 31 patients taking NSAIDs, 19 presented with a perforation or peritonitis. By contrast, only eight of the 61 patients not taking NSAIDs had such complications (P less than 0.001). Eleven patients presented with bleeding of whom five were taking NSAIDs and six were not. Patients admitted with complications of diverticular disease have a high incidence of NSAID intake, and it appears that NSAID consumption is associated with a more severe form of the disease. 
Heparin, deep venous thrombosis, and trauma patients. One hundred consecutive patients with multiple trauma, who were admitted to a level I trauma center with an injury severity score of 10 or greater, were studied prospectively. A duplex scan was used to evaluate each patient initially and at set intervals during the hospitalization for the presence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The prophylactic regimen for DVT in this study was 5,000 U of subcutaneous heparin every 12 hours. This was used in 50 patients at the discretion of the attending physician, while the remaining 50 patients received no DVT prophylaxis. Fourteen of 50 patients (28%) who were receiving heparin developed DVT, while only 1 patient (2%) of the 50 who did not receive heparin developed DVT. The use of heparin did not provide any significant protection in the susceptible trauma patient. It is believed that those patients with minimal lower extremity injuries, lower injury severity scores, and a shorter period of immobilization do not require any form of DVT prophylaxis. However, those patients at increased risk for DVT are better served with either increased doses of heparin or alternative forms of DVT prophylaxis. 
Prospective randomized evaluation of ciprofloxacin versus piperacillin plus amikacin for empiric antibiotic therapy of febrile granulocytopenic cancer patients with lymphomas and solid tumors. The European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer International Antimicrobial Therapy Cooperative Group. Empiric therapy for febrile granulocytopenic patients is mandatory, but whether monotherapy is a safe alternative and whether fluoroquinolones are useful agents for this indication are still controversial issues. The use of monotherapy with intravenous ciprofloxacin (200 to 300 mg every 12 h) was evaluated against combined therapy with piperacillin plus amikacin in febrile granulocytopenic patients with solid tumor or lymphoma. The study was discontinued prematurely because patients treated with ciprofloxacin had a significantly lower overall success rate than patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin (31 of 48 patients [65%] versus 48 of 53 patients [91%], P = 0.002). Patients with gram-positive coccal bacteremia had a particularly poor outcome: therapy failed for six of eight patients (75%) treated with ciprofloxacin, while therapy failed for none of four patients treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. Death from primary infection during initially randomized protocol therapy occurred in 7 of 48 patients (14.5%) treated with ciprofloxacin and in 3 of 53 (6%) treated with piperacillin plus amikacin. This study does not support the use of this dose of intravenous ciprofloxacin as empiric monotherapy for fever in granulocytopenic patients. 
Late results of two hundred seventeen femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments. A 10-year-experience of 217 femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments in 207 patients is reported. Thirty-three femoropopliteal bypasses (15%) were performed with reversed saphenous vein and 184 (85%) with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Operative indications were gangrene in 121 (56%), nonhealing ulceration in 40 (18%), ischemic rest pain in 51 (24%), and claudication in 5 (2%) cases. The 5-year primary graft patency rate of these bypasses was 59% (reversed saphenous vein, 74%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 55%; p less than 0.05), the secondary 5-year graft patency rate was 61% (reversed saphenous vein, 79%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 56%; p less than 0.05), and the 5-year limb salvage rate was 78% (reversed saphenous vein, 78%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 78%). The 30-day operative mortality rate was 10%, and the 5-year patient survival rate was 38%. Eleven patients (5%) required lower extremity amputation because of progressive gangrene or extensive infection despite a patent bypass to an isolated popliteal artery segment. We conclude that femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments (1) have acceptable 5-year graft patency and limb salvage rates; (2) should be performed with reversed saphenous vein grafts when possible; (3) may be performed with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts if necessary, with a resulting limb salvage rate equal to that of reversed saphenous vein grafts; and (4) require sequential extension to an infrapopliteal artery in up to 20% of patients. In addition, the presence of an isolated popliteal artery segment is associated with a high operative mortality rate and limited life expectancy because of coronary artery disease. 
Pathogenetic mechanism of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: follow-up of stroke patients with and without atrial fibrillation. Stroke patients with brain infarction and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF, n = 88) or sinus rhythm (SR, n = 188), treated at a population-based stroke unit, were studied for 5 years. Within 1 month, 13% of NVAF and 2% of SR patients (P less than 0.01) had either a stroke recurrence or systemic embolism. After 5 years, the corresponding figures were 26 and 25%, respectively. The 1-month and 5-year mortality values were 35 and 78% in the NVAF group vs. 7 and 52% in the SR group (P less than 0.01). Age, ischaemic heart disease and function group on arrival at the hospital were independent risk factors for death. The main cause of death was ischaemic heart disease in the NVAF group, and complications to the initial stroke or a stroke recurrence in the SR group. Thus a higher risk of death, stroke recurrence and peripheral embolism was evident only during the first month after stroke. 
Applications and transfer of technology to the nations of the South. Biotechnology and the control of childhood enteric infections. The optimal use of biotechnology to address the health care needs of developing countries entails the formation of interdisciplinary working groups linking basic biomedical scientists with public health workers, epidemiologists, physicians, and social scientists. Their mission should be congruent with and guided by the public health goals and primary care program of the country or region. Moreover, their research and development activities should lead to products that address a specific need and which are evaluable, cost-effective, and readily transferred to the public health sector. With respect to the enteric infections of childhood, the essential components of an integrated control effort are a field site where infections of this kind are common and readily studied; a local public health laboratory where the performance of new products can be tested and where technology transfer can occur; a basic science laboratory where molecular pathogenicity studies lead to new diagnostic tests, vaccines, and drugs; and a production laboratory where these products can be refined and prepared in sufficient amounts for field testing. This strategy is now being evaluated for the control of infantile diarrhea through the combined use of epidemiologic investigations, DNA probe and amplification techniques, and molecular fingerprinting. Together, these methods are yielding new information about microbial reservoirs and transmission systems; in turn, this information should lead to highly focused public health interventions. 
Monitoring, reentry, and relapse prevention for chemically dependent health care professionals. Monitoring and reentry programs for chemically dependent health care professionals are increasingly being recognized as important components of recovery efforts targeted at this population. Such monitoring and preventive programs should incorporate certain eligibility requirements, patient-monitoring program contracts, recovery maintenance activities and adjuncts, work-site assessments and reentry recommendations, random body fluid analysis, relapse management, and clear explanations of financial responsibility. Monitoring and reentry programs need to be fully integrated within the spectrum of resources available to health care professionals. 
Limb salvage for osteosarcoma in the 1980s. The incidence of local recurrences following limb salvage performed by experienced surgeons with wide surgical margins and with the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy is sufficiently low (5%-10%) so as not to have a biologically statistically significant impact on the long-term survival rate. Following limb salvage, the incidence of morbidity increases with a few patients occasionally requiring prolonged or repeated hospitalizations and further surgical procedures, even amputation. The durability of the reconstructions is variable, and many of the mobile knee reconstructions may need to be revised if the patients become long-term survivors. The function of salvaged limbs is better than that after the alternative amputation, but none of the reconstructions will give normal function. Finally, no matter which type of surgery on the lower extremity is selected, patients will have a good early psychosocial adjustment if no premorbid psychosocial disorder is present. 
The effect of sterile water blocks on low back labor pain. To evaluate the analgesic effect of intradermal sterile water blocks, 272 women in labor complaining of severe low back pain were randomly assigned to treatment with either sterile water or saline solution blocks. Pain intensity was assessed on a visual analog scale, before the blocks were given and again 1 and 2 hours later. The groups were equal with regard to age, parity, fetal size, progression of labor, and initial pain scoring. Pain scoring 1 and 2 hours after the blocks were given showed a significantly higher degree of analgesia in the sterile water group. No adverse effects were noted, and patient acceptability was high. 
Hereditary sacral agenesis with presacral mass and anorectal stenosis: the Currarino triad. A family with autosomal dominant inheritance of sacral agenesis is described. Ten members were affected; four had associated presacral teratomas and anterior sacral meningoceles, giving rise to serious complications in three, including bacterial meningitis, local recurrence of teratoma and perianal sepsis. Three of those with presacral masses presented initially with anorectal anomalies. Other associated abnormalities included tethering of the cord, hydrocephalus, duplex ureter, hydronephrosis, vesicoureteric reflux, neurogenic bladder, bicornuate uterus, rectovaginal fistula and hereditary spherocytosis. Early diagnosis and surgical excision of a presacral mass is advised to prevent future morbidity and mortality. 
Adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving 2 cell types (prostate specific antigen producing and carcinoembryonic antigen producing) with selective metastatic spread. Of 3 patients with clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate 2 were treated by radical prostatectomy and 1 was treated with radiation therapy. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) values were elevated before therapy. After treatment the PSA levels were decreased to zero. All 3 patients later had evidence of metastatic tumor spread to the liver with elevation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen but not PSA. Immunohistochemical staining of the 2 primary tumors from the prostatectomy specimens identified 2 cell clones, one immunoreactive to PSA and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and nonimmunoreactive to carcinoembryonic antigen, and the other immunoreactive to carcinoembryonic antigen but not PSA or PAP. Biopsy of a hepatic metastasis in 2 patients confirmed anaplastic carcinoma of the carcinoembryonic antigen-producing cell type. Immunohistochemical staining of a lymph node metastasis identified the PSA-producing cell type only. Such results suggest selective metastatic spread of each cell type to its own organ tropic site. Occasional carcinoembryonic antigen-producing prostate cancers may metastasize to the liver. Serum carcinoembryonic antigen measurements occasionally may be useful in the management of certain prostate adenocarcinoma patients. 
Reduced postoperative hospitalization after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. An initial experience of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 50 consecutive patients was reviewed and the results compared with those of a group of 25 patients who underwent laparotomy cholecystectomy during the 3 months before the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed in 44 of 50 consecutive patients in whom it was attempted. When compared with laparotomy, laparoscopy cholecystectomy was associated with longer mean (s.d.) anaesthesia, 155 (61) min versus 102 (31) min (P less than 0.001), shorter mean postoperative hospital stay, 3.5 (1.5) versus 8.8 (3.2) days (P less than 0.001), and reduced mean cost, pounds 895 (376) versus pounds 2210 (822) (P less than 0.001). Perioperative morbidity was also reduced following laparoscopy cholecystectomy (9 per cent versus 16 per cent) but not significantly so. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe, effective procedure which completely removes the gallbladder. It significantly reduces hospital stay, is cosmetically satisfactory and has financial benefits. We suggest that this technique be considered for all patients having cholecystectomy. 
Fulminant hepatic failure due to acute hepatitis B and delta co-infection: probable bloodborne transmission associated with a spring-loaded fingerstick device. Fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) due to acute hepatitis B and delta co-infection occurred in a 74-yr-old female, who eventually died. There was no clear-cut epidemiology other than probable bloodborne transmission from a contaminated spring-loaded fingerstick device used for glucose determination, in an outpatient facility. This unusual mode of transmission reiterates the importance of using sterile cleansing and disposal procedures anytime there is a possibility of contamination with blood. 
Collinear nutrients and the risk of colon cancer. The relationship between colon cancer risk and the relative contributions of fat and caloric intake are assessed. A lack of consensus exists regarding the role of each of these dietary factors in the development of colon cancer. This lack of agreement originates from the high correlations between the nutrients, as well as the manner in which researchers treat these dietary variables in their analyses. Four proposed methods are evaluated which attempt to address the collinearity problem in nutritional epidemiology: (1) exclude one or more collinear variables, (2) use the proportion of calories consumed attributable to each dietary component, (3) use a regression-adjustment approach to purge the collinearity correlated nutrients, and (4) ridge regression. Diagnostic tests are reported which assess the degree of collinearity on data collected for a case-control study of colon cancer conducted in Utah between 1979 and 1983. Using logistic regression analyses, we apply each of these methods to case-control data. We find that the risks associated with fat and caloric consumption are extremely sensitive to a priori analytic decisions made by epidemiologist about the underlying collinearity problem. 
Cerebral blood flow and carbon dioxide reactivity in children with bacterial meningitis. We examined total and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) by stable xenon computed tomography in 20 seriously ill children with acute bacterial meningitis to determine whether CBF was reduced and to examine the changes in CBF during hyperventilation. In 13 children, total CBF was normal (62 +/- 20 ml/min/100 gm) but marked local variability of flow was seen. In five other children, total CBF was significantly reduced (26 +/- 10 ml/min/100 gm; p less than 0.05), with flow reduced more in white matter (8 +/- 5 ml/min/100 gm) than in gray matter (30 +/- 15 ml/min/100 gm). Autoregulation of CBF appeared to be present in these 18 children within a range of mean arterial blood pressure from 56 to 102 mm Hg. In the remaining two infants, brain dead within the first 24 hours, total flow was uniformly absent, averaging 3 +/- 3 ml/min/100 gm. In seven children, CBF was determined at two carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) levels: 40 (+/- 3) mm Hg and 29 (+/- 3) mm Hg. In six children, total CBF decreased 33%, from 52 (+/- 25) to 35 (+/- 15) ml/min/100 gm; the mean percentage of change in CBF per millimeter of mercury of PCO2 was 3.0%. Regional variability of perfusion to changes in PCO2 was marked in all six children. The percentage of change in CBF per millimeter of mercury of PCO2 was similar in frontal gray matter (3.1%) but higher in white matter (4.5%). In the seventh patient a paradoxical response was observed; total and regional CBF increased 25% after hyperventilation. Our findings demonstrate that (1) CBF in children with bacterial meningitis may be substantially decreased globally, with even more variability noted regionally, (2) autoregulation of CBF is preserved, (3) CBF/CO2 responsitivity varies among patients and in different regions of the brain in the same patient, and (4) hyperventilation can reduce CBF below ischemic thresholds. 
A direct effect of hyperinsulinemia on serum sex hormone-binding globulin levels in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. To determine whether hyperinsulinemia can directly reduce serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, six obese women with this disorder were studied. Before study, ovarian steroid production was suppressed in each woman by the administration of 7.5 mg of a long-acting GnRH agonist, leuprolide depot, im, on days -56, -28, and 0. This resulted in substantial reductions in serum concentrations of testosterone (from 1.72 +/- 0.29 nmol/L on day -56 to 0.32 +/- 0.09 nmol/L on day 0), non-SHBG-bound testosterone (from 104 +/- 16 pmol/L on day -56 to 19 +/- 5 pmol/L on day 0), androstenedione (from 7.25 +/- 1.65 nmol/L on day -56 to 2.78 +/- 0.94 nmol/L on day 0), estrone (from 371 +/- 71 pmol/L on day -56 to 156 +/- 29 pmol/L on day 0), estradiol (from 235 +/- 26 pmol/L on day -56 to 90 +/- 24 pmol/L on day 0), and progesterone (from 0.28 +/- 0.12 nmol/L on day -56 to 0.08 +/- 0.02 nmol/L on day 0). Serum SHBG levels, however, did not change (18.8 +/- 2.8 nmol/L on day -56 vs. 17.8 +/- 2.6 nmol/L on day 0). While continuing leuprolide treatment, the women were administered oral diazoxide (300 mg/day) for 10 days to suppress serum insulin levels. Diazoxide treatment resulted in suppressed insulin release during a 100-g oral glucose tolerance test (insulin area under the curve, 262 +/- 55 nmol/min.L on day 0 vs. 102 +/- 33 nmol/min.L on day 10; P less than 0.05) and deterioration of glucose tolerance. Serum testosterone, androstenedione, estrone, estradiol, and progesterone levels did not change during combined diazoxide and leuprolide treatment. In contrast, serum SHBG levels rose by 32% from 17.8 +/- 2.6 nmol/L on day 0 to 23.5 +/- 2.0 nmol/L on day 10 (P less than 0.003). Due primarily to the rise in serum SHBG levels, serum non-SHBG-bound testosterone levels fell by 43% from 19 +/- 5 pmol/L on day 0 to 11 +/- 4 pmol/L on day 10 (P = 0.05). These observations suggest that hyperinsulinemia directly reduces serum SHBG levels in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome independently of any effect on serum sex steroids. 
The origin of pain in optic neuritis. Determinants of pain in 101 eyes with optic neuritis. In 101 eyes with either anterior or retrobulbar optic neuropathy of ischemic or inflammatory origin, ocular pain occurred significantly more often with retrobulbar optic neuropathy. The association of pain with posterior optic nerve lesions supports Whitnall's hypothesis that the pain of optic nerve inflammation is caused by traction of the origins of the superior and medial recti on the optic nerve sheath at the orbital apex. Eye pain reflected neither severity nor origin of optic neuropathy. 
Transcutaneous oxygen tensions in assessing the treatment of healed venous ulcers Transcutaneous oxygen tension (Ptc,O2) was assessed as an indicator of risk of reulceration in 68 limbs with healed venous ulcers. Ptc,O2 was also used to assess two methods of ulcer prophylaxis. Measurements were made over the gaiter skin, the healed ulcer and the upper arm. The results were expressed as a ratio of the lower limb readings over those taken from the arm. Patients were randomized, after the ulcer had healed, to elastic stockings and stanozolol, or elastic stockings and surgical ligation of incompetent superficial veins. Patients who declined to participate in the study were prescribed elastic stockings only. Those limbs remaining healed at 12 months had Ptc,O2 ratios remeasured. The Ptc,O2 ratios from limbs that reulcerated were not significantly lower than those from limbs remaining healed. The Ptc,O2 ratio was significantly increased in limbs treated by stanozolol and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05) and by surgery and elastic stockings (P less than 0.05). There was no significant increase in Ptc,O2 in limbs treated by elastic stockings alone. In those treated by surgery and elastic stockings, there was a significant improvement in limbs with normal deep veins (P less than 0.01), but not in limbs with post-thrombotic changes on ascending phlebography. Although these two methods of ulcer prophylaxis improve the Ptc,O2 ratio, a high ratio has not been shown to be beneficial in preventing ulcer recurrence. 
Validation of hourly pain intensity profiles with chronic pain patients. This study examines how empirically derived pain intensity profiles relate to psychological adjustment in chronic pain patients. Hourly pain intensity ratings over the course of a day of 189 chronic pain patients were categorized into 6 groups using a hierarchical regression analysis technique. The profiles reflected linear, curvilinear, multilinear or "no profile" effects. Judges' ratings of pain intensity profiles were found to be less reliable than ratings based on empirical analysis. The majority of patients showed linear profiles while 26% of the patients showed no consistent relationship between hourly pain intensity and time of day. Patients who showed no consistent trend in their pain ratings reported having significantly higher ratings of emotional distress. They tended to have conflicts at home and showed more pain behavior than patients who had a distinct pain profile. Support is given for the potential clinical utility of pain rating profiles. 
Extraspinal causes of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Twelve of 12,125 patients who had been referred during a seven-year period to a specialist in spinal disorders were found to have an extraspinal cause of radiculopathy or neuropathy of the lower extremity. The records of these twelve patients were reviewed retrospectively. The average age of the twelve patients was sixty-five years (range, forty-two to seventy-seven years). The cause of the symptoms was an occult malignant tumor in nine patients and a hematoma, an aneurysm of the obturator artery, or a neurilemoma of the sciatic nerve in the others. The average time from the onset of symptoms to the final diagnosis was eight months (range, one month to two years). The most useful test for determination of the correct diagnosis was computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the spine and bone-scanning of the whole body were of little help in localizing the disease. In four of the twelve patients, an operation was performed on the basis of an incorrect diagnosis. In dealing with elderly patients who have radiculopathy, one should be suspicious that the cause is outside the spine. 
Neurofibromatosis type I--a rare case resulting in conductive hearing loss. Notwithstanding the many similarities, there are important differences between NF1 and NF2. NF1-related neurofibromas, which can number in the hundreds, can occur all over the body. Unique clinical situations, such as the case described here, can occur that test the ingenuity of the physician. Once the presenting problem has been ameliorated, genetic counseling is imperative in this common and at times devastating genetic disease. 
Placental site trophoblastic tumor in a postmenopausal woman. Placental site trophoblastic tumor is a rare neoplasm that arises in the trophoblastic tissue of the placental bed. This case report is unusual because of the patient's advanced age at the time of diagnosis and the favorable response of the disease to chemotherapy. Although the clinical course is benign for most patients with placental site trophoblastic tumor, the malignant variant of the disease is characterized by recurrence, relative insensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy, and death. To the authors' knowledge, the 53-year-old woman reported is the oldest patient with histologically confirmed placental site trophoblastic tumor. Initially, surgery, radiation, and multiagent chemotherapy failed to control vaginal and pulmonary metastatic disease. After administration of four treatment cycles of a "second-line" chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, complete clinical and radiologic remission was achieved. The patient's serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin has remained undetectable, and she has been without measurable evidence of disease for 16 months. 
Eyelid gold weights in the management of facial palsy. We reviewed our experiences with 20 patients with established facial palsy who had a total of 24 gold weights inserted. All patients had corneal symptoms: ulceration, exposure keratitis or discomfort abolished. Functional improvement i.e. reduction of lagophthalamos and restoration of the blink reflex was good in our opinion and that of the patients in all cases. Dissatisfaction with the cosmetic result was expressed by two patients due to the prominence of the weight under the thin eyelid skin. Three patients had to have the weight replaced because it was too light. Two patients had their weights removed because of recurrent eyelid infections. In two patients the weights were removed as they had migrated over the tarsal rim. In one of these patients the weight was replaced immediately in the appropriate position, in the other it was not replaced as dissatisfaction had been expressed due to the bulky appearance of the weight under the eyelid skin. 
Gastrointestinal endoscopy and general surgical practice. Surgical endoscopy versus surgeon endoscopists. Endoscopic studies and treatment are a necessary and vital component of General Surgery practice. Since most of the concepts related to therapeutic endoscopy were conceived and developed in the context of surgical science, it is both appropriate and necessary that surgeons continue their involvement with this modality. Furthermore, within the evolution of surgical science, endoscopic tools will continue to be utilized. 
Esophageal involvement in mixed connective tissue disease. A study of esophageal symptoms and function was performed in 21 patients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Esophageal involvement was found in 18 cases (85%), in 14 (66%) with typical symptoms, in 15 (71%) with manometric abnormalities and in 11 (57%) with both. The manometric pattern was characterized by reduction of amplitude and coordination of peristaltic waves throughout the esophageal body and reduction of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) competency. In comparison, 38 patients with systemic sclerosis showed a similar but more severe pattern, particularly at the level of the distal esophagus and LES. Thus, although similar, the esophageal involvement in MCTD was not exactly the same as that of systemic sclerosis. Furthermore, in MCTD a correlation between manometric abnormalities and cutaneous involvement was lacking, and this suggests that esophageal disorders are not always linked with clinically evident scleroderma-like features of this disease. Since the diagnosis of MCTD is made in the presence of the clinical picture of more than one connective tissue disease, the detection of esophageal involvement by a sensitive technique such as esophageal manometry in a patient with suspected MCTD may be a useful diagnostic aid. 
Usefulness of ST-segment changes in greater than or equal to 2 leads on the emergency room electrocardiogram in either unstable angina pectoris or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in predicting outcome. To determine the reliability of the admission electrocardiogram in predicting outcome in patients hospitalized for chest pain at rest, 90 patients were randomized into a trial of aspirin versus heparin in unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, and prospectively followed for 3 months. The emergency room admission electrocardiogram was analyzed for ST-segment deviation greater than or equal to 1 mm/lead and T-wave changes. Unfavorable outcomes were recurrent ischemic pain, myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization with angioplasty or surgery. In patients who underwent coronary arteriography, a myocardium in jeopardy score ranging from 0 to 10 was assigned, based on the number of vessels with a diameter stenosis greater than or equal to 70% and the location of the stenoses. Considering all 90 patients, an admission electrocardiogram with ST-segment deviation in greater than or equal to 2 leads had a positive predictive value for adverse clinical events of 79% and a negative predictive value of 64%. In the subset of patients without left ventricular hypertrophy and whose admission electrocardiograms were recorded during chest pain (62 of 90), the positive predictive value of ST deviation in greater than or equal to 2 leads improved to 89% and the negative value to 72%. Of the 62 patients, 53 underwent coronary arteriography. There was a positive linear correlation between the total number of leads with ST-segment deviation and the myocardium in jeopardy score (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001). 
Quantitative relation between increased intrapericardial pressure and Doppler flow velocities during experimental cardiac tamponade. To establish whether a quantitative relation exists between pericardial pressure and respiratory variation in intracardiac blood flow velocities, a spontaneously breathing closed chest canine model of pericardial tamponade was created. In seven dogs, pericardial pressure was sequentially increased in stages from a mean of -4 +/- 1 to 10 +/- 2 mm Hg while aortic and pulmonary Doppler flow velocities, pleural pressure changes (respiratory effort), blood pressure and cardiac output were measured. The variation in the Doppler-detected peak transaortic velocity (AV) during inspiration (IV) increased linearly from -5 +/- 3% at baseline (pericardial pressure -4 mm Hg) to -32 +/- 9% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg [IVAV = -2 (pericardial pressure)--13.1; r = 0.78, p less than 10(-6)]. The inspiratory variation in the peak transpulmonary velocity increased from 13 +/- 3% at baseline to 71 +/- 19% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg. The inspiratory variation in the pulmonary Doppler peak velocity (IVPV) was dependent on both pericardial pressure and degree of respiratory effort [IVPV = 3.8 (pericardial pressure) + 2.6 (respiratory effort) + 10.9; r = 0.88, p less than 10(-8)]. Thus, quantitative relations exist between increases in intrapericardial pressure and increases in inspiratory variation of peak aortic and pulmonary flow velocities. Additionally, pulmonary artery flow velocity is influenced more than aortic velocity by intrathoracic pressure. 
Lack of HLA class I antigen expression by cultured melanoma cells FO-1 due to a defect in B2m gene expression. The melanoma cell line FO-1 does not express HLA class I antigens and does not acquire them on the cell surface after incubation with IFN-gamma. Immunochemical studies showed that FO-1 cells synthesize HLA class I heavy chain, but do not synthesize beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2-mu). The latter abnormality is associated with lack of beta 2-mu mRNA which remains undetectable in FO-1 cells incubated with IFN-gamma. The defect was identified as a genetic lesion in the B2m gene, since DNA hybridization analysis detected a deletion of the first exon of the 5'-flanking region, and of a segment of the first intron of the B2m gene. HLA class I antigen expression was reconstituted on melanoma cells FO-1 after transfection with the wild-type mouse B2m gene, thereby confirming the abnormality of the endogenous B2m gene. The defect identified in FO-1 cells is distinct from that underlying the lack of HLA class I antigen expression by lymphoblastoid cells Daudi, but is remarkably similar to that causing lack of H-2 class I antigen expression by mouse lymphoblastoid cells R1 (TL-). These results suggest that genetic recombination in the 5' region of the B2m gene is a recurrent mechanism in B2m gene defects. In addition to contributing to our understanding of molecular abnormalities in HLA class I antigen expression by melanoma cells, FO-1 cells represent a useful model for analyzing the role of HLA class I antigens in the biology of melanoma cells and in their interaction with cells of the immune system. 
Effects of calcium antagonists on glomerular hemodynamics and structure in experimental hypertension. The RK, DS, and UNX SHR rats are related models of progressive renal disease characterized by the presence of severe systemic hypertension and reduction in renal mass. In these models, glomerular injury is related to increased glomerular pressure and to kidney and glomerular hypertrophy. As summarized in Table 1, administration of a calcium antagonist reduces the prevalence of glomerular sclerosis in all three models. Calcium antagonists have many effects that might tend to reduce renal injury. Similar to the ACE inhibitors, they may reduce PGC, although a protective effect has been observed in some models despite persistence of marked glomerular capillary hypertension. Calcium antagonists also appear to inhibit compensatory renal growth. The observation that these drugs lessen injury in experimental hypertension has important implications for the treatment of patients with hypertension and renal disease. However, widespread use of calcium antagonists specifically to prevent kidney damage should await the results of controlled clinical trials. 
Histopathologic validation of angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound. BACKGROUND. To establish a histopathologic basis for angioscopic and ultrasound image interpretation we studied 70 postmortem human arterial segments in vitro. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used 7- to 9-French fiber-optic angioscopes and 20- to 30-MHz intravascular ultrasound imaging catheters. Three observers assigned an angioscopic and ultrasound image classification to each vessel segment. The image and histological classification categories were then compared. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of both methods separately or in combination for normal vessels were each greater than or equal to 95%. The predictive value was better for angioscopy than for ultrasound due to incorrect ultrasound interpretations of normal anatomy in the presence of thrombus. For stable atheroma the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the individual methods were each greater than 90%. However, both angioscopy and ultrasound had classification errors in that disrupted atheroma was identified and classified as stable atheroma. Consequently, the predictive value was 74% for angioscopy and 78% for ultrasound. For disrupted atheroma the sensitivities for angioscopy and ultrasound were only moderate (73% and 81%, respectively), whereas the specificity, accuracy, and predictive value were each high (greater than 90%). For thrombus detection, the specificity, accuracy, and predictive value were high (greater than 93%) for each method. The sensitivity of angioscopy was 100%. However, sensitivity was lower for ultrasound (57%) due to false-negative interpretation of laminar clots in normal vessels and an inability to distinguish disrupted or stable atheroma from intraluminal thrombus. CONCLUSIONS. Contingency analyses showed that each imaging method alone or combined had significant agreement with the results obtained from histology (p less than 0.001). When assessing all cases in which angioscopy and ultrasound were concordant, there was a 92% agreement with the histological classification. 
Systemic effects of collagen-impregnated aortoiliac Dacron vascular prostheses on platelet activation and fibrin formation. To minimize intraoperative blood loss a watertight knitted Dacron aortoiliac prosthesis has been developed by impregnation with bovine collagen. A potential disadvantage is that collagen may be associated with an increase in thrombus formation. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to study the systemic effects of collagen-impregnated prostheses and of aortoiliac operation as such on the coagulation mechanism during the first 10 days after operation. Forty-one patients randomly received either a collagen-impregnated (n = 20) or a nonimpregnated prosthesis (n = 21). Twelve patients who underwent cholecystectomies served as controls. Three markers of the coagulation mechanism were monitored: beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products. We found no significant differences in median beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product levels between patients in the collagen-impregnated prosthesis group and patients in the nonimpregnated prosthesis group. This indicates that collagen does not stimulate the coagulation cascade any more than conventional Dacron protheses do. In a comparison of patients who underwent aortoiliac reconstruction and patients who underwent cholecystectomies, the results indicated a significant increased platelet activation and fibrin metabolism in aortoiliac reconstruction group compared with the control group. Finally, we observed a significantly higher preoperative fibrin metabolism in patients with vascular disease than in control subjects. This difference is attributable to the high preoperative fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product values in patients with aortic aneurysms. 
Exercise testing and training in patients with peripheral vascular disease and lower extremity amputation. Patients with peripheral vascular disease have a high risk of coronary artery disease. The risk is even greater when the peripheral vascular disease leads to lower extremity amputation. Exercise testing using lower extremity exercise has been the "gold standard" for screening for coronary artery disease, but many patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with amputations have difficulty doing this type of exercise. Arm exercise ergometry has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative for the detection of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot do leg exercise. This test has also been used to determine safe exercise levels and may be able to predict the ultimate level of prosthetic use in amputees. Exercise training with arm ergometry also improves cardiovascular efficiency and upper body strength in poorly conditioned patients. Studies are needed to appreciate fully the role of exercise testing and training in the recovery of these patients after amputation. 
Short-term variation in abnormal antenatal fetal heart rate records. In a retrospective study the relation of reduced fetal heart rate variation to fetal acidemia was analyzed with a computerized system for numeric analysis. Between 1983 and 1987, 78 pregnancies were identified in which at least one record of the fetal heart rate had very low long-term variation. The outcome was analyzed to determine the numeric criteria of fetal heart rate variation that most efficiently detect a fetus that will die (preterminal) or is dying (terminal). Because fetal compromise was found on occasion to be associated with a slow sinusoidal fetal heart rate rhythm that increased measures of long-term variation. It was necessary to define a new index of short-term fetal heart rate variation (the 1/16 minute epoch-epoch variation). This was closely related to long-term variation (r = 0.9) but provided better detection of preterminal records as judged by metabolic acidemia at delivery or intrauterine death. 
Presence of the terminal complement complex (C5b-9) precedes myelin degradation in immune-mediated demyelination of the rat peripheral nervous system. In this study, the terminal complement complex C5b-9 (TCC) was localized by immunocytochemistry at different clinical stages of experimental autoimmune neuritis. Deposits of TCC were found on the surface of Schwann cells and their myelin sheaths, and to some extent in the extracellular space at predilective sites of impending demyelination before onset of clinical signs and for a short period thereafter. Additionally, TCC was deposited on the surface of W3/13 positive leukocytes. No TCC immunoreactivity was seen in the distal stump of transected sciatic nerves 1 to 15 days after axotomy. The early and transient deposition of TCC on Schwann cells and myelin sheaths in experimental autoimmune neuritis before overt demyelination suggests that complement activation plays a pathogenic role in the initiation of immune-mediated myelin damage. The lack of TCC immunoreactivity after nerve transection excludes a nonspecific activation process. The signals involved in local TCC formation in demyelinating peripheral nervous system disorders have yet to be explored. 
The "two week syndrome" associated with injection treatment for chronic pain--fact or fiction? Many patients attending the pain clinic for regular injections of local anaesthetic state that the pain returned "two weeks" ago. This study demonstrates that 85% of these patients have a "return of pain" interval which coincides with the proximity of their next clinic appointment. 
Atrial antitachycardia pacing in children and young adults. Atrial antitachycardia pacing was tested in 23 children and young adults. The majority of these patients had had operative repair of congenital cardiac defects and had both bradycardia and tachycardia. Pacemakers were usually implanted by the transvenous technique using bipolar leads. In each patient it was possible to find a tachycardia termination algorithm that successfully converted the tachycardia. In some patients very complex algorithms were necessary. In each patient it was also possible to find an algorithm that successfully differentiated the abnormal tachycardia from sinus tachycardia. Twelve patients required no antiarrhythmic drugs after pacemaker implantation, while 10 patients required one drug and one patient required two drugs. Eight of 23 patients had symptomatic tachycardias that required reprogramming the pacemaker to a different tachycardia termination sequence. Seven patients required reoperations, five for adapter problems and two for infection or erosion. Cardiac function improved in 15 of the 23 patients. Antitachycardia pacing is a viable option for management of tachycardias in children and young adults. 
Median frequency--a new parameter for predicting defibrillation success rate. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: Current American Heart Association guidelines recommend immediate defibrillation of ventricular fibrillation. When this is unsuccessful, there are no guidelines to help determine the optimum time at which to defibrillate after the administration of an alpha-adrenergic agonist. Previous studies have shown that the median frequency of the ventricular fibrillation ECG signal correlates with myocardial perfusion during CPR. We hypothesized that median frequency could predict the success of defibrillation and thus accurately determine the most appropriate time at which to defibrillate during ventricular fibrillation. STUDY POPULATION: Twenty-two mixed-breed swine weighing more than 15 kg were studied. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced electrically, and the ventricular fibrillation ECG signal was analyzed using fast Fourier analysis. After ten minutes of ventricular fibrillation, mechanical CPR was begun. After three minutes of CPR, the animals received one of three alpha-adrenergic agonists and CPR was continued. Defibrillation was attempted three and one-half minutes after drug administration. The average median frequency 20 seconds before defibrillation was calculated. Sensitivity and specificity of median frequency with respect to defibrillation success were determined. RESULTS: A median frequency of 9.14 Hz had a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 92.31% in predicting the results of defibrillation in this model. CONCLUSION: The median frequency may serve as a valuable parameter to guide defibrillation therapy during ventricular fibrillation. 
Cysts of the neuraxis of endodermal origin. Five colloid cysts of the third ventricle were compared with two spinal enterogenous cysts to examine the hypothesis that these entities have the same origin from primitive endodermal tissue. All the lesions showed cuboidal and columnar epithelium with mucus containing goblet cells and cilia. Immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin, EMA and CEA was positive in all the colloid cyst and enterogenous cyst epithelium. S-100 was focally positive in three of the colloid and one of the enterogenous cysts while vimentin and GFAP were negative in both. The anatomical distribution of both colloid and enterogenous cysts is reviewed. An illustrative case of an identical cyst within the fourth ventricle is presented. This suggests that the similarities between colloid and enterogenous cysts and the presence of identical lesions along the neuroaxis indicate that these structures are derived from primitive foregut endoderm. 
Septicaemia and adrenal haemorrhage in congenital asplenia. Five patients developed overwhelming infection as a result of congenital asplenia, which was previously unsuspected in all cases. Each illness followed a fulminant course resulting in death within 24 hours. They illustrate the respective roles of Haemophilus influenzae infection (n = 4) and adrenal haemorrhage (n = 4) in this condition. We suggest a management protocol for screening infants with abnormalities of the atria or viscera with splenic ultrasound and examination of a blood film for Howell-Jolly bodies. Vaccination and prophylactic antibiotics should be considered for those at risk. Vigorous use of parenteral antibiotics and steroids in suspected infection is recommended. 
Retrospective long-term follow-up analysis in 21 patients with chordomas of various sites treated at a single institution. Twenty-one patients with chordoma were treated at the Radiation Oncology Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, between 1949 and 1986. Thirteen patients had sacrococcygeal tumors, five had clival tumors, two had nasopharyngeal tumors, and one had a lumbar spine tumor. Nine patients were treated with surgery alone, eight patients with subtotal resection and postoperative irradiation, and four patients with radiotherapy alone after biopsy. The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 74% and 46%, respectively. The 10-year actuarial survival rate was significantly better in patients treated with surgery alone or surgery and irradiation than in those treated with radiotherapy alone (52%, 32%, and 0%, respectively, p = 0.02). Although all patients ultimately suffered a recurrence, those with lumbosacral tumors treated with surgery and irradiation had a longer mean disease-free survival period (6.6 years) than those treated with surgery alone (4.1 years) (p = 0.08). Disease-free survival times of patients with base of the skull tumors was not significantly different between the treatment groups. Irradiation after resection of chordomas appears to increase the time to first relapse in lumbosacral tumors and should be considered after subtotal resection. 
Middle meatus anstrostomy: patency rates and risk factors. Two hundred patients with chronic sinusitis were operated on using functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) techniques. These patients were followed closely over 3 years. Patency of the endoscopic middle meatotomy was recorded using actuarial life-table methods. The overall patency rate of the endoscopic middle meatotomy was 93.55%, and the actuarial patency rate at 36 months was 87.47%. The presence of seasonal allergy with nasal polyps was the most important variable in predicting closure. Middle turbinectomy was the most important variable in predicting patency. Symptoms were evaluated by questionnaire at 1 year. Questionnaire data indicate that 96% of these patients are improved or asymptomatic. 
Striatal function in normal aging: implications for Parkinson's disease. Central to several current theories of the etiology of Parkinson's disease is the premise that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system degenerates with normal aging. Much of the evidence for this assertion has come from postmortem neurochemical studies. We have used L-6-[18F] fluoro-Dopa and positron emission tomography in 26 healthy volunteers (age range, 27-76 years) to examine striatal and frontal cortical tracer uptake. Data have been analyzed by using a graphical approach to calculate an influx constant (Ki) for L-6-[18F]fluoro-Dopa uptake into the caudate, putamen, and medial frontal cortex of each subject. In the population studied, there was no decline in Ki with age for any of these structures. A series of physiological measurements made on the older subjects also showed few significant changes with age. The positron emission tomographic findings demonstrate preservation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in normal aging. The pathological process causing Parkinson's disease may operate closer to the time of presentation than has been suggested. 
Total peripheral artery occlusions: conventional versus laser thermal recanalization with a hybrid probe in percutaneous angioplasty--results of a randomized trial Increasing the primary success rate in recanalization of peripheral vascular occlusions is one aim of using laser techniques in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease. Although reports of lasers enabling recanalization after failure of guide wires have been numerous, direct comparisons of the success of the two techniques in a randomized trial have been few. The results of a randomized trial showed no statistical difference in recanalization of femoropopliteal occlusions between the conventional guide wire and hybrid laser probe. The number of patients with iliac occlusions was small and comparisons are difficult to make, but the findings suggest that the hybrid laser probe has little to offer. Immediate crossover to the alternative method allowed investigation of the relationship between the two methods in practice. Combining the two methods improved the primary success rate from 82% to 91% for femoropopliteal occlusions randomized to laser thermal recanalization and from 74% to 91% for those randomized to conventional recanalization. 
Normal splenic size in infants and children: sonographic measurements. The purpose of this study was to establish guidelines for normal splenic size at different ages by using a simple and reproducible sonographic method. Two hundred thirty patients, from neonate to 20-year-old, had sonography because of abdominal and/or pelvic problems unrelated to the spleen. Findings on sonograms of the liver and kidneys were normal in all cases. Splenic size was measured by obtaining a coronal view that included the hilum, while the patient was breathing quietly. The greatest longitudinal distance between the dome of the spleen and the tip (splenic length) was measured and correlated with age, height, and weight. The following guidelines are proposed for the upper limit of normal splenic length based on this simple, easy to use, one-measurement technique: splenic length no greater than 6.0 cm at 3 months, 6.5 cm at 6 months, and 7.0 cm at 12 months, 8.0 cm at 2 years, 9.0 at 4 years, 9.5 cm at 6 years, 10.0 cm at 8 years, 11.0 cm at 10 years, 11.5 cm at 12 years, 12.0 cm at 15 years or older for girls, and 13.0 cm at 15 years or older for boys. Twenty-two patients with known abnormalities of the spleen were randomly selected and their splenic lengths compared with the proposed guidelines; in each case, the length of the spleen exceeded the upper limit of normal for that age. Normal values of a single measurement of the greatest longitudinal diameter of the spleen, from the dome to the tip measured at the hilum in the coronal plane, were obtained in patients from newborn to 20 years old. 
Coronal alignment after total knee replacement. Maquet's line passes from the centre of the femoral head to the centre of the body of the talus. The distance of this line from the centre of the knee on a long-leg radiograph provides the most accurate measure of coronal alignment. Malalignment causes abnormal forces which may lead to loosening after knee replacement. We report a series of 115 Denham knee replacements performed between 1976 and 1981 using the earliest design of components, inserted with intramedullary guide rods. Patients were assessed clinically and long-leg standing radiographs were taken before operation, soon after surgery and up to 12 years later. In two-thirds of the knees (68%) Maquet's line passed through the middle third of the prosthesis on postoperative films and the incidence of subsequent loosening was 3%. When Maquet's line was medial or lateral to this, an error of approximately +/- 3 degrees, the incidence of loosening at a median period of eight years was 24%. This difference is highly significant (p = 0.001). Accurate coronal alignment appears to be an important factor in prevention of loosening. Means of improving the accuracy of alignment and of measuring it on long-leg radiographs are discussed. 
Insulin resistance. A multifaceted syndrome responsible for NIDDM, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Diabetes mellitus is commonly associated with systolic/diastolic hypertension, and a wealth of epidemiological data suggest that this association is independent of age and obesity. Much evidence indicates that the link between diabetes and essential hypertension is hyperinsulinemia. Thus, when hypertensive patients, whether obese or of normal body weight, are compared with age- and weight-matched normotensive control subjects, a heightened plasma insulin response to a glucose challenge is consistently found. A state of cellular resistance to insulin action subtends the observed hyperinsulinism. With the insulin/glucose-clamp technique, in combination with tracer glucose infusion and indirect calorimetry, it has been demonstrated that the insulin resistance of essential hypertension is located in peripheral tissues (muscle), is limited to nonoxidative pathways of glucose disposal (glycogen synthesis), and correlates directly with the severity of hypertension. The reasons for the association of insulin resistance and essential hypertension can be sought in at least four general types of mechanisms: Na+ retention, sympathetic nervous system overactivity, disturbed membrane ion transport, and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Physiological maneuvers, such as calorie restriction (in the overweight patient) and regular physical exercise, can improve tissue sensitivity to insulin; evidence indicates that these maneuvers can also lower blood pressure in both normotensive and hypertensive individuals. Insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are also associated with an atherogenic plasma lipid profile. Elevated plasma insulin concentrations enhance very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis, leading to hypertriglyceridemia. Progressive elimination of lipid and apolipoproteins from the VLDL particle leads to an increased formation of intermediate-density and low-density lipoproteins, both of which are atherogenic. Last, insulin, independent of its effects on blood pressure and plasma lipids, is known to be atherogenic. The hormone enhances cholesterol transport into arteriolar smooth muscle cells and increases endogenous lipid synthesis by these cells. Insulin also stimulates the proliferation of arteriolar smooth muscle cells, augments collagen synthesis in the vascular wall, increases the formation of and decreases the regression of lipid plaques, and stimulates the production of various growth factors. In summary, insulin resistance appears to be a syndrome that is associated with a clustering of metabolic disorders, including non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension, lipid abnormalities, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. 
Intrahepatic recurrence after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma complicating cirrhosis. To determine whether a careful evaluation of tumor extension by preoperative computed tomography scan after intra-arterial injection of ultrafluid lipiodol and by intraoperative ultrasound examination reduced the recurrence rate of hepatocellular carcinoma after resection, a series of 47 cirrhotic patients with a single tumor operated on from 1984 was studied. Alphafetoprotein level was less than 100 ng/mL in 26 patients (55%), size of the tumor was less than 5 cm in 28 patients (59%), and capsule was present in 30 patients (63%). The resection was performed with free margin measuring 1 cm or more. The overall cumulative survival rates at 3 and 5 years were 35% and 17%, respectively. Intrahepatic recurrence was observed in 28 patients (60%), located less than 2 cm from the resection margin in only four patients. The cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 3 years was 81% and was significantly higher in patients with tumor greater than or equal to 5 cm and in patients with preoperative alphafetoprotein level of greater than or equal to 100 ng/mL. In this series the cumulative intrahepatic recurrence rate at 5 years was 100%. This high recurrence rate after resection, even with careful evaluation of tumor extension, indicates that liver transplantation might be envisaged for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with resectable hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Body composition in ballet dancers measured by total body electrical conductivity. The purpose of this study was to describe the body composition of adolescent and young adult ballet dancers using total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC). We studied 112 female and 33 male dancers. The mean ages were 15.0 +/- 2.0 and 18.7 +/- 3.1 yr for females and males, respectively. The mean percent body fat (PBF) values were 20.1 +/- 3.6% for the females and 14.5 +/- 4.2% for the males. Age and pubertal development were not significantly related to PBF in the females. Age and pubertal status were significantly inversely related to PBF in the males. There was no difference in dance history, percent body fat, and abdominal/hip or waist/hip ratios in eumenorrheic vs amenorrheic dancers. Estimated calorie intake indicated that dancers with menstrual abnormalities had lower calorie intake than those with normal menses. This is the largest group of ballet dancers whose body composition has been studied. Our PBF measurements are higher than in previous reports using hydrodensitometry, which may have underestimated body fat by not accounting for the increased bone density in the lower extremities of dancers. Our data suggest that previous measurements of PBF in dancers are underestimates; these new data challenge our concept of PBF values in dancers. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery. Predominant finding of aggressive duodenal ulcer disease. We reviewed our experience with endoscopically evaluated severe upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage following open heart surgery. Of 4892 patients undergoing open heart surgery, 18 (0.4%) sustained upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring endoscopic evaluation. Endoscopy identified the source of bleeding in all cases. No significant complications of endoscopy were observed. Duodenal ulcers (DUs) were found in 16 (89%) of cases and were felt to be the source of bleeding in 15 (83%). Aggressive features, such as multiplicity, large size, or distal location were associated with 13 (81%) of the DU cases. Complications necessitated endoscopic or surgical therapy in eight (44%) patients with DUs. We conclude that aggressive DU disease accounts for the majority of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery. 
Efficacy of transrectal ultrasound for identification of clinically undetected prostate cancer. A total of 51 patients underwent transrectal ultrasound of the prostate before radical cystoprostatectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Each had a normal prostate by digital rectal examination, no history of prostatic adenocarcinoma and no invasion of the prostate by transitional cell carcinoma. Real-time and step-sectioned ultrasound images were interpreted at the time of sonography and results were compared to pathological examination of the step-sectioned prostate specimen. When adenocarcinoma was identified in the specimen, cancer volume was determined. Positive ultrasound scans consisted of those exhibiting hypoechoic lesions. Hypoechogenicity due to transurethral resection defects, benign hyperplasia, vascular structures or shadowing from calcifications was not considered positive. Of 51 patients 27 (52.9%) exhibited no abnormality on ultrasound and were free of cancer in the prostate specimen, while 8 (15.7%) demonstrated a hypoechoic lesion that was proved to be prostate cancer. Seven patients (13.7%) with normal transrectal ultrasound scans had adenocarcinoma of the prostate, while 9 (17.6%) had lesions on ultrasound but no cancer. Based on these results, transrectal ultrasound has a sensitivity of 53.3% and a specificity of 75%. Further analysis reveals that transrectal ultrasound is more accurate in the detection of cancers of greater than 0.20 cc in volume than those of 0.20 cc or less. Transrectal ultrasound also is more accurate in the detection of peripheral zone than transition zone cancers. 
Circadian infusion of floxuridine in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A total of 42 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma received floxuridine infusion for 14 days at monthly intervals. The drug was delivered via an external programmable pump on a time-modified or circadian schedule; the highest dose of 68% was given between 3 and 9 p.m. Of the 42 patients 25 (60%) had undergone prior nephrectomy. Of the 40 evaluable patients 4 (10%, 95% confidential interval 3 to 24%) achieved a partial response: 3 of the 4 had undergone prior nephrectomy, while 1 had undergone renal angioinfarction. Another 4 patients (10%) had responses at metastatic sites but no response in the primary kidney tumor. The median duration of response for these 2 groups of patients was 65 and 27 weeks, respectively, and the most responsive site was the lungs. The treatment was generally well tolerated and could be administered on an outpatient basis. Our study confirms the limited but definite activity of floxuridine infused on a circadian schedule in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. We observed responses in metastasis equally in patients with or without prior nephrectomy. 
Human IgE, IgG4 and resistance to reinfection with Schistosoma haematobium. A well recognized feature of the immune response to parasitic helminth infections, including schistosomiasis, is the production of large amounts of specific and nonspecific IgE1,2. Immunological pathways involving IgE can lead to damage to the developing schistosomulum and it has been suggested that responses involving IgE could have evolved as protection against helminth infections. There has been no epidemiological evidence to support this idea and the only significant IgE responses known in man are those involved in the pathogenesis of allergic disease. Here we measure serological response during reinfection with S. haematobium and demonstrate that IgE antibodies in man can be beneficial. Our results support the hypothesis that the slow build-up of IgE to high levels and the early production of IgG4 antibodies, which may block IgE pathways are responsible for delaying the development of protective immunity to S. haematobium. 
The role of reperfusion-induced injury in the pathogenesis of the crush syndrome. The crush syndrome consists of the general manifestations that follow prolonged continuous pressure on the limbs. These manifestations are caused by the disintegration of muscle tissue and leakage of the contents of myocytes into the plasma. The morbidity and mortality associated with this syndrome are high. The pathophysiologic process of the derangements associated with the crush syndrome is not fully understood, but the injury induced by reperfusion is likely to be important in its development. The injury due to reperfusion involves many factors, but it is currently ascribed largely to the release of oxygen free radicals, massive accumulation of calcium in ischemic muscles, and the infiltration of neutrophils into reperfused vessels. Since ischemic muscles cannot survive without reperfusion, a strategy to salvage as much of the muscle and kidney tissue as possible in the crush syndrome must include ways of decreasing injury during ischemia and reperfusion. Various pharmacologic agents may attenuate or prevent reperfusion-induced injury to ischemic skeletal muscles and consequently to other organs, particularly the kidneys. 
Results and prognostic factors of surgery in the management of non-small cell lung cancer with solitary brain metastasis. Between 1975 and 1988, 37 patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and synchronous (within 1 month, n = 10) or metachronous (n = 27) solitary brain metastasis (SBM) underwent combined excision of their lesions. Overall 5-year and median survival were 30% and 27 months (range, 3 to 125+ months), respectively. Twenty-seven patients had a relapse, and their median disease-free interval (DFI) was 17.5 months (range, 1 to 108 months). The most frequent (78%, n = 20) site of first recurrence locally was either the ipsilateral thorax (n = 14) or brain (n = 6). In univariate analysis, age, primary tumor and lymph node status; tumor histology, size, and side; type of pulmonary resection; side and location of SBM; and onset of presentation did not affect survival and DFI. By contrast, the interval (less than or equal to versus greater than 12 months) between the two operations significantly affected survival (P = 0.0096) and DFI (P = 0.046). The DFI was also affected by the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for the primary tumor (P = 0.02). Using the Cox model, AC was the most independent predictor of DFI. These data support the inclusion of surgery in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with NSCLC and SBM. 
Cerebrovascular events after myocardial infarction: analysis of the GISSI trial. Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico (GISSI). OBJECTIVES--To describe the epidemiology of cerebrovascular events in patients given or not given fibrinolytic treatment and to assess the prognostic implications and risk factors. DESIGN--Case series derived from the GISSI randomised trial. SETTING--176 coronary care units in Italy giving various levels of care. PATIENTS--5860 patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with 1.5 million units of intravenous streptokinase and 5852 patients not given fibrinolytic treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cerebrovascular event, sex, age, blood pressure, history of previous infarct, site of infarction, and Killip class. RESULTS--99 of 11,712 patients (0.84%) had a cerebrovascular event. Older age, worse Killip class, and anterior location of infarction seemed to be risk factors for cerebrovascular events (40/3201 aged 65-75 v 42/7295 aged less than 65, odds ratio 2.18; 9/437 class 3 v 55/8277 class 1, 1.81; and 57/4878 anterior v 24/4013 posterior, 1.96). No significant difference was found in the rate of cerebrovascular events between patients treated with streptokinase and controls (45/5852 (0.92%) streptokinase v 54/5860 (0.77) control). More patients in the streptokinase group than in the control group had cerebrovascular events (especially haemorrhagic strokes) on day 0-1 after randomisation (27 streptokinase v 7, control), although this was balanced by late events in control patients (54 streptokinase v 45 control at one year). The mortality of patients who had a cerebrovascular event was higher than that of those who did not (47% (47/99) v 11.6% (1350/11,613]. CONCLUSIONS--Although the incidence of cerebrovascular events complicating myocardial infarction was low, they increased morbidity and mortality. Treatment with streptokinase did not significantly alter the incidence, but age and poor haemodynamic state were associated with an increased risk. 
Complications associated with brachytherapy alone or with laser in lung cancer. Relatively little has been reported about destruction through brachytherapy of mucosa-perforating and extraluminary tumors with probable large vessel involvement causing major hemorrhagic or fistular complications. We report 12 patients subjected to laser and brachytherapy for centrally occluding lung cancer, whom we have periodically followed up from June 1986 until they died. Although all laser procedures were free from complications, necrotic cavitation in five cases, two of which were accompanied by large bronchoesophageal fistulas, and massive fatal hemoptysis occurred in six. Minor complications included radiation mucositis (two), noncritical mucosal scarring (two), and cough (four). Characteristics that will identify patients at risk of developing fatal hemoptysis and fistulas should be better defined by imaging and endoscopic techniques. In such cases, modifying the protocol or using alternative procedures should be considered. Minor complications, such as cough, can be avoided by using topical steroid therapy (eg, beclomethasone dipropionate). 
Effect of exercise intensity and duration on regional function during and after exercise-induced ischemia. BACKGROUND. Transient reversible myocardial dysfunction has been documented after episodes of exercise-induced ischemia. This study was undertaken to determine whether the duration or intensity of exercise affects the severity of postischemic dysfunction in this setting. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ten dogs were instrumented with ultrasonic microcrystals for measurement of wall thickening, with circumflex coronary artery flow probes, and with hydraulic occluders. Dogs performed low-intensity exercise, which was sufficient to increase coronary perfusion 50% above control, and high-intensity exercise, which was sufficient to double coronary blood flow. To investigate the effects of exercise intensity on postischemic dysfunction, we had dogs perform high-intensity exercise for 5 minutes in the presence of a stenosis. On the alternate day, dogs performed low-intensity exercise for 10 minutes in the presence of a stenosis. These two protocols provide equivalent coronary flow debts. Mean transmural blood flow during high-intensity exercise without stenosis (2.61 +/- 0.54 ml/min/g) was significantly higher than that during low-intensity exercise (1.74 +/- 0.61 ml/min/g, p less than 0.002). During high-intensity exercise with coronary artery stenosis, subendocardial blood flow was significantly lower than that during low-intensity exercise with stenosis (0.64 +/- 0.40 versus 1.08 +/- 0.28 ml/min/g, p less than 0.02). This difference in subendocardial perfusion was associated with greater degrees of regional dysfunction during exercise (circumflex wall thickening was 44 +/- 23% of control for high-intensity exercise versus 60 +/- 18% of control for low-intensity exercise, p less than 0.01). In addition, from 10 to 30 minutes after exercise, wall thickening in myocardium perfused by the circumflex coronary artery remained significantly lower after high-intensity exercise than that after low-intensity exercise. To assess the effects of exercise duration on the severity of postischemic dysfunction, we had dogs perform low-intensity exercise in the presence of a coronary stenosis for 10 minutes and low-intensity exercise for only 5 minutes on alternate days. Systolic wall thickening was significantly lower after low-intensity exercise for 10 minutes than after low-intensity exercise for 5 minutes. CONCLUSIONS. High-intensity exercise results in greater degrees of subendocardial hypoperfusion and greater degrees of regional dysfunction both during and after exercise-induced ischemia than does low-intensity exercise. Second, exercise duration also exerts an effect on the severity of postischemic dysfunction, although the magnitude of this effect is less important than the effect of exercise intensity. 
Association of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis in carcinoma of the breast with infiltrating lobular carcinoma. An autopsy study. We analyzed the autopsy records of 261 patients with breast carcinoma, who died at The Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, for the presence of metastases to the central nervous system, particularly for the presence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Metastases to the central nervous system were found in 41 (18.1%) of 226 patients who had metastatic cancer. In 24 cases (10.6%), metastases were seen in brain parenchyma; in 11 cases (4.9%), only dura mater was involved, and in six cases (2.6%), leptomeningeal carcinomatosis was found. All patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis showed some symptoms of central nervous system involvement while alive. The patients died between 2 weeks and 2 months after the onset of central nervous system symptoms. Four of six patients with such a complication presented with locally advanced or disseminated carcinoma on the first admission. With regard to histologic findings, three patients had infiltrating lobular carcinoma, two had infiltrating ductal carcinoma, and one had mixed infiltrating lobular and ductal carcinoma, with a metastasizing lobular component. Metastases to the brain parenchyma were found exclusively in infiltrating ductal carcinoma. We stress that infiltrating lobular carcinoma represents a distinctive type of breast cancer with an unusual propensity to disseminate into leptomeninges, as this occurred in almost 14% of all cases of infiltrating lobular carcinoma in our series in contrast to a 1% incidence in cases of infiltrating ductal carcinoma. 
Leiomyosarcoma arising in atypical fibromuscular hyperplasia (phyllodes tumor) of the prostate with distant metastasis. An extremely rare neoplasm of the prostate, commonly known as phyllodes type of atypical prostatic hyperplasia, is described in a 57-year-old man. Over a 2-year period, the atypical smooth muscle component has transformed into leiomyosarcoma, and eventually metastasized to the bones and the lungs. Such an evolution has never been documented for this tumor. 
Predictors and prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea and snoring in 1001 middle aged men. One thousand and one men, aged 35-65 years, were identified from the age-sex register of one group general practice. Over four years 900 men were visited at home and asked questions about symptoms potentially related to sleep apnoea and snoring. Height, weight, neck circumference, resting arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and spirometric values were also determined. All night oximetry was then performed at home and the tracing analysed for the number of dips in SaO2 of more than 4%. Subjects with more than five dips of 4% SaO2 or more per hour were invited for sleep laboratory polysomnography. Seventeen per cent of the men admitted to snoring "often." Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.2%), cigarette consumption (r2 = 3.4%), and nasal stuffiness (r2 = 2%) as the only significant independent predictors of snoring. Together these account for at least a sixfold variation in the likelihood of being an "often" snorer. Forty six subjects (5%) had greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates of over five an hour and 31 of these had full sleep studies. Three subjects had clinically obvious and severe symptomatic obstructive sleep apnoea, giving a prevalence of three per 1001 men (0.3%; 95% confidence interval 0.07-0.9%). Eighteen men had obstructive sleep apnoea only when supine and in 10 the cause of the SaO2 dipping on the original home tracing was not elucidated. The greater than 4% SaO2 dip rates correlated with the history of snoring. Multiple linear regression techniques identified and ranked neck circumference (r2 = 7.9%), alcohol consumption (r2 = 3.7%), age (r2 = 1%) and obesity (r2 = 1%) as the only significant independent predictors of the rate of overnight hypoxic dipping. This study shows that snoring in this randomly selected population correlates best with neck size, smoking, and nasal stuffiness. Obstructive sleep apnoea, defined by nocturnal hypoxaemia, correlates best with neck size and alcohol, and less so with age and general obesity. 
Intramedullary nailing for impending pathological subtrochanteric fractures. We reviewed ten patients with metastatic carcinoma and impending pathological fractures of the subtrochanteric region of the femur who had prophylactic insertion of the Russell-Taylor reconstruction nail. There were no operative complications or long-term mechanical failures. This reconstruction nail has some technical and biomechanical advantages over other implants and is ideal for the management of such cases. 
Effects of radiation on testicular function in long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the Children Cancer Study Group. Testicular function was evaluated in 60 long-term survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). All the patients were treated on two consecutive Children Cancer Study Group protocols and received identical chemotherapy and either 18 or 24 Gy radiation therapy (RT) to one of the following fields: craniospinal plus 12 Gy abdominal RT including the gonads (group 1); craniospinal (group 2); or cranial (group 3). The median age at the time of their last evaluation was 14.5 years (range, 10.5 to 25.7), which took place a median of 5.0 years (range, 1 to 10.3) after discontinuing therapy. The incidence of primary germ cell dysfunction as judged by raised levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and/or reduced testicular volume was significantly associated with field of RT; 55% of group 1, 17% of group 2, and 0% of group 3 were abnormal (P = .002). Leydig cell function, as assessed by plasma concentrations of luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone, and pubertal development, was unaffected in the majority of subjects regardless of RT field. These data indicate that in boys undergoing therapy for ALL, germ cell dysfunction is common following testicular irradiation and can occur following exposure to scattered irradiation from craniospinal RT. In contrast, Leydig cell function appears resistant to direct irradiation with doses as high as 12 Gy. 
Effect of hypercapnia on total pulmonary resistance during wakefulness and during NREM sleep. We investigated the effect of different levels of hypercapnia on total pulmonary resistance (RL) in 13 subjects ranging from nonsnorers with low RL to snorers with high RL and dynamic narrowing of the upper airway during inspiration. Added CO2 was adjusted to achieve a steady-state increase in PETCO2 of +2, +4, or +6 mm Hg. RL was measured at peak inspiratory flow (RLpf), at maximal resistance within breath (RLmax), and at 10 equally spaced points within inspiration in several trials. During wakefulness, hypercapnia was associated with decreased RLmax. During steady state +6 mm Hg hypercapnia, RLmax decreased by 30% (p less than 0.01). During NREM sleep, low levels of hypercapnia did not affect RL. However, +6 mm Hg hypercapnia was associated with decreased RLmax in six of eight subjects (p = 0.07), especially in subjects with high RLmax during room air breathing. The effects of hypercapnia on RLpf paralleled its effect on RLmax. We concluded that (1) the decrease in RL during awake hypercapnia suggests an increase in upper airway dimensions and stiffness, (2) the absence of increased RL during low level NREM hypercapnia (despite the increase in inspiratory flows and collapsing pressures) also suggests an increase in upper airway dimensions and stiffness, and (3) upper airway dilating muscles appear to be recruited in a coordinated fashion with inspiratory muscles in normal humans during NREM sleep. The implications of these findings in patients with obstructive sleep apnea are not clear at this point. 
Argon laser-assisted anastomoses in medium-size vessels: one-year follow-up. Laser-assisted anastomosis of medium-size vessels can be performed with satisfactory short-term patency. This study was undertaken to evaluate patency and structural integrity up to 1 year. An argon laser was used to make bilateral femoral arteriovenous anastomoses in 12 dogs compared to conventional suture method in another 8 dogs. These anastomoses were evaluated for patency and aneurysm formation at 1 hour; 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks; and 12 months after surgery. All anastomotic sites were patent and without aneurysmal change or luminal narrowing at all harvesting intervals. Histologic examination revealed that within 1 month laser anastomotic sites were almost completely healed and without intimal hyperplasia. In suture anastomoses, foreign-body reaction remained evident up to 1 year. Use of the argon laser for medium size vessel anastomoses resulted in excellent patency without aneurysm formation or intimal hyperplasia even in the long term. These data suggest promising clinical applications. 
Inhibitory effect of sandostatin on secretion of luteinising hormone and ovarian steroids in polycystic ovary syndrome. Hyperinsulinism accompanies the raised luteinising hormone (LH) concentrations in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Somatostatin inhibits insulin and LH secretion in healthy adults, so the effect of treatment with a long-acting somatostatin analogue ('Sandostatin') on gonadotropin and androgen secretion in PCOS was investigated. LH pulsatility, androgen concentrations, and hormonal responses to an oral glucose load and to administration of a GnRH agonist (buserelin) were measured before and after 7 days' treatment with sandostatin 100 micrograms subcutaneously twice a day in 10 amenorrhoeic women with classic features of PCOS. Sandostatin significantly reduced integrated LH concentrations and LH pulse amplitudes, oestradiol, testosterone, and androstenedione concentrations, and LH responses to buserelin; it also suppressed insulin and C-peptide responses to an oral glucose load. Thus sandostatin inhibits pituitary and ovarian hormonal responses in part by a direct influence on pituitary activity, and the possibility of an indirect effect mediated by changes in insulin concentrations requires investigation. These findings have implications for the treatment of infertility in women with PCOS. 
Stop codon in the procollagen II gene (COL2A1) in a family with the Stickler syndrome (arthro-ophthalmopathy). Linkage analysis with restriction fragment length polymorphisms for the gene for type II procollagen (COL2A1) was carried out in a family with the Stickler syndrome, or arthro-ophthalmopathy, an autosomal dominant disorder that affects the eyes, ears, joints, and skeleton. The analysis demonstrated linkage of the disease and COL2A1 with a logarithm-of-odds score of 1.51 at zero recombination. A newly developed procedure for preparing cosmid clones was employed to isolate the allele for type II procollagen that was linked to the disease. Analysis of over 7000 nucleotides of the gene revealed a single base mutation that altered a CG dinucleotide and converted the codon CGA for arginine at amino acid position alpha 1-732 to TGA, a stop codon. From previous work on procollagen biosynthesis, it is apparent that the truncated polypeptide synthesized from an allele with a stop codon at alpha 1-732 cannot participate in the assembly of type II procollagen, and therefore that the mutation would decrease synthesis of type II procollagen. It was not apparent, however, why the mutation produced marked changes in the eye, which contains only small amounts of type II collagen, but relatively mild effects on the many cartilaginous structures of the body that are rich in the same protein. 
The trk proto-oncogene product: a signal transducing receptor for nerve growth factor The trk proto-oncogene encodes a 140-kilodalton, membrane-spanning protein tyrosine kinase (p140prototrk) that is expressed only in neural tissues. Nerve growth factor (NGF) stimulates phosphorylation of p140prototrk in neural cell lines and in embryonic dorsal root ganglia. Affinity cross-linking and equilibrium binding experiments with 125I-labeled NGF indicate that p140prototrk binds NGF specifically in cultured cells with a dissociation constant of 10(-9) molar. The identification of p140prototrk as an NGF receptor indicates that this protein participates in the primary signal transduction mechanism of NGF. 
Duodenal somatostatinoma with congenital pseudoarthrosis. We describe a previously unreported association between somatostatinoma and congenital pseudoarthrosis. Because pseudoarthrosis is part of von Recklinghausen's disease, in turn with an association with somatostatinoma, we speculate on a link between pseudoarthrosis and somatostatinoma. 
Repeat infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in patients with acute myocardial infarction and early recurrent myocardial ischemia. When conventional treatment of patients with early clinical reinfarction after thrombolytic therapy fails, mechanical revascularization may be attempted. An alternative strategy, repeat thrombolytic infusions, is reported. Fifty-two patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated with one or two additional thrombolytic infusions of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) because of nonsustained ischemia after initial treatment with rt-PA or streptokinase. Thirty-five patients received the second infusion within 1 h of the first; 13 patients received the second infusion 1 to 72 h after the first and 4 patients received it later during their hospitalization. Bleeding complications occurred in 10 patients (19%); however, most of these were minor (no intracranial bleeding) and only 2 patients required blood transfusion. In 14 patients in whom the decrease in fibrinogen and plasminogen levels was measured after the first and second infusions, this decrease was only 25% and 63%, respectively--only slightly higher than the 22% and 53% decreases measured in 63 patients who had only one rt-PA infusion. In 44 patients (85%), the acute ischemia resolved completely within 1 h after initiation of the second infusion. In 23 patients (44%), pain and ST segment elevation did not recur and invasive coronary intervention was avoided. Thus, repeat rt-PA infusions can stabilize a substantial number of patients with acute reinfarction and, even when relief is temporary, repeat rt-PA infusions can minimize myocardial damage while patients await mechanical revascularization. 
Assessment of quality of life. Assessment of quality of life has emerged in recent years as an important part of the overall evaluation of drug therapy and health care in general. Measurement techniques for this difficult assessment range from simple unqualified questions on patient well-being to complex statistical analyses of a wide range of lifestyle and activity variables. The factors that influence quality of life during chronic drug therapy differ in the treatment of symptomatic (e.g., heart failure) vs asymptomatic (e.g., hypertension) disease, and include drug side effects, relief of symptoms, improved prognosis, return to work, physical activity and the need for further hospital treatments. The manifestation of quality of life varies for different people leading to lack of agreement on the precise definition. The absence of standardization of methods of measurement also contributes to this and leads to lack of comparability of studies and unreasonable claims by some drug manufacturers. Further complicating issues in multicenter trials across countries include language problems and interethnic differences in "sickness" behavior. The recently introduced quality-adjusted life year (QALY) index, designed to take account of both the quality and duration of life in assessing the outcome of treatments, may avoid some of these problems. By classifying illness states (the Rosser index) on the basis of disability and distress, and comparing outcomes in terms of improved prognosis, QALYs have already been used for cost/benefit analyses of a number of new and expensive therapies. Like other methods, QALYs have problems related to variability in individual appreciation of life values. To date, a perfect method of quality of life assessment remains elusive. 
Evidence for a defect in growth hormone-releasing factor signal transduction in the dwarf (dw/dw) rat pituitary. Dwarf (dw/dw) rats exhibit a 40% reduction in body growth, isolated GH deficiency (less than 5% of normal pituitary content), and a decreased number of pituitary somatotrophs (15-20% of normal). Since GH-releasing factor (GRF) stimulates GH synthesis and secretion and somatotroph proliferation, and its effects are probably mediated by cAMP, we have assessed GH secretion and cAMP production in dw rat pituitaries in response to various GH secretagogues. Dispersed pituitary cells from dw rats were less sensitive (2.5-fold) to stimulation of GH secretion by GRF and showed a 25% reduction in the maximal GH response even after normalization of their reduced GH content. Intracellular cAMP was elevated 63-fold over basal levels in normal cells after 4 h in response to maximal GRF stimulation, but only 1.9-fold in dw cells, and even larger differences between the groups were found at earlier time points. The GH responses of dw cells to exogenous cAMP, however, were indistinguishable from normal. Forskolin, a direct stimulator of adenylate cyclase, elicited comparable maximal GH and cAMP responses, but an increased ED50, in dw cells. Activation of GS alpha by cholera toxin showed an increased ED50 and reduced GH and cAMP responses in dw cells, and marked decreases in these responses were observed in response to prostaglandin E1. Phorbol ester stimulation resulted in a reduced maximal GH response in dw cells without a change in sensitivity. These results provide evidence for a defect in the GRF signal transduction pathway associated with a decreased ability of GS alpha to stimulate adenylate cyclase in dw rat somatotrophs that may be causally linked to their GH deficiency. 
Reaction time and movement velocity abnormalities in Parkinson's disease under different task conditions. We examined reaction times, movement velocities, and the associated agonist and antagonist muscle behaviors in nine Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and eight normal subjects before and after medications, using a wrist extension task to changing locations of a visual target. Targets changing 500 msec before an auditory "go" signal act as a preparatory cue, while targets changing at the time of the go signal provide a combined auditory and visual stimulus. Late target changes allowed examination of (1) reaction times during an ongoing movement, and (2) movement in the presence and absence of visual targets. PD prolonged the time from the onset agonist electromyographic activity and reduction of antagonist activity to movement onset. Both were shortened by preparatory cues and combined visual and auditory go signals. PD slowed movement only in a subset of trials in which there was movement to a displayed target. 
The proximal element of the beta globin locus control region is not functionally required in vivo. In addition to local sequence elements the regulation of the high-level, development- and tissue-specific expression of the human beta globin gene cluster appears to require distant regulatory sequences which have been termed locus control region. In the chromatin of erythroid cells the locus control region is characterized by four DNaseI hypersensitive sites that are located 6-18 kb 5' of the epsilon globin gene. The definition of the sequences minimally required for locus control region activity is likely to further the understanding of its physiology and will be of interest for the development of somatic gene therapy strategies of the hemoglobinopathies. We present here the analysis of a family with a 3,030-bp deletion of sequences upstream of the epsilon globin gene including the most 3' locus control region element and cosegregating beta degree thalassemia. The deletion is linked in cis to a structurally and functionally normal beta globin gene. The proximal element of the locus control region does not therefore appear to be necessary for beta globin gene activity in vivo. 
Alterations in the levels of iron, ferritin and other trace metals in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases affecting the basal ganglia. Levels of iron, copper, zinc and manganese were measured by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy in frozen postmortem brain tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy with strionigral degeneration (MSA), and Huntington's disease (HD) compared with control subjects. Total iron levels were found to be elevated in the areas of basal ganglia showing pathological change in these disorders. In particular, total iron content was increased in substantia nigra in PD, PSP and MSA, but not in HD. Total iron levels in the striatum (putamen and/or caudate nucleus) were increased in PSP, MSA and HD but not in PD. Total iron levels were decreased in the globus pallidus in PD. There were no consistent alterations of manganese levels in basal ganglia structures in any of the diseases studied. Copper levels were decreased in the substantia nigra in PD, and in the cerebellum in PSP, and were elevated in the putamen and possibly substantia nigra in HD. Zinc levels were only increased in PD, in substantia nigra and in caudate nucleus and lateral putamen. Levels of the iron binding protein ferritin were measured in the same patient groups using a radio-immunoassay technique. Increased iron levels in basal ganglia were generally associated with normal or elevated levels of ferritin immunoreactivity, for example, the substantia nigra in PSP and possibly MSA, and in putamen in MSA. The exception was PD where there was a generalized reduction in brain ferritin immunoreactivity, even in the substantia nigra. An increase in total iron content appears to be a response to neurodegeneration in affected basal ganglia regions in a number of movement disorders. However, only in PD was there an increased total iron level, decreased ferritin content, decreased copper content, and an increased zinc concentration in substantia nigra. These findings suggest an alteration of iron handling in the substantia nigra in PD. Depending on the form in which the excess iron load exists in nigra in PD, it may contribute to the neurodegenerative process. 
Revision of failed knee replacements using fixed-axis hinges. Forty failed hinged arthroplasties of the knee were revised by the insertion of another hinged implant. In 14 cases the prosthesis used at the revision operation was similar to the primary implant; in 26, a hinge with an elongated femoral stem was used, usually replacing part of the femoral shaft. In seven of these knees an elongated tibial stem was also required, though the tibial shaft was replaced in only two of them. There were many complications. Fracture of the femur at the tip of the femoral stem was the most frequent. Sixteen first revisions failed and were revised a second time; 12 required replacement of the distal femoral shaft and three required replacement of the proximal tibia. The incidence of complications in knees requiring a second revision was even higher. Four required a third revision after an average interval of three years. Failure of a hinged prosthesis results in bone loss mainly in the femur. Revision of a failed hinged prosthesis with another of the same design is unlikely to be successful and may cause fracture of the femur. 
The epidemiology of exposure to electromagnetic fields: an overview of the recent literature. Epidemiologic studies of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) have been reviewed. Possible links to incidences of cancer and abnormal fetal development have been suggested by some investigators. In general, the results have been inconsistent. There are many deficiencies in the studies, and many questions have been raised about the validity of some of the conclusions proposed. There is currently no definitive evidence of an association between exposure to EMF and the alleged risks. Due to problems and limitations inherent in future studies (misconceptions about exposure levels, uncertainty about field variability, criticisms of surrogate measures), this question is unlikely to ever be answered with certainty. Unfortunately, many highly-publicized accounts of speculative and unsubstantiated claims have caused undue concern among the general public. 
Increased amino acid transport into brain tumors measured by PET of L-(2-18F)fluorotyrosine The uptake of L-(2-18F)fluorotyrosine (F-Tyr), a newly synthetized amino acid tracer, was studied in 15 patients with various brain tumors by dynamic PET. The higher F-Tyr accumulation in tumors (mean 27% above contralateral tissue) was associated with two-fold transport rates into tumors, while the rate constants describing irreversible incorporation were decreased. The increased F-Tyr transport was not correlated to 68Ga-EDTA accumulation and cannot be explained by disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Kinetic analysis of 2-(18F)-fluoro-deoxy-glucose accumulation in the same patients demonstrated that increased metabolic rates in tumors are mainly caused by altered phosphorylation rates while transport of glucose is less affected. Since F-Tyr transport rates clearly separated tumors from normal tissue and since F-Tyr accumulation was related to tumor grade, PET studies of F-Tyr uptake are of clinical value for diagnosis and classification of brain tumors. 
Similar prevalence of renovascular hypertension in selected blacks and whites. Renovascular hypertension is a potentially curable form of high blood pressure that is thought to be extremely rare among blacks. We demonstrate, however, that in a clinically selected population, the prevalence of renovascular hypertension is similar in blacks and whites. We prospectively evaluated 167 hypertensive subjects who had one or more clinical features known to be associated with renovascular hypertension. All subjects had captopril-stimulated peripheral renin measurements and conventional renal arteriography. All significant renal artery stenoses (greater than 50% luminal narrowing) were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgery. Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed if there was a blood pressure response to interventional therapy, according to the criteria established by the Cooperative Study of Renovascular Hypertension. Of the total group evaluated, 24% (39 of 167) had renal artery stenosis and 14% (23 of 167) had renovascular hypertension. Renal artery stenosis or occlusion was found in 27% (26 of 97) of whites and 19% (13 of 67) of blacks (p = 0.27). Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed in 18% (17 of 97) of whites and 9% (6 of 67) of blacks evaluated (p = 0.25). Renovascular hypertension was associated with severe or refractory hypertension and with smoking, but there were no racial differences in these associations. Blacks with renovascular hypertension tended to have low captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity. We conclude that blacks with clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension should be evaluated with angiography. Captopril-stimulated plasma renin may not be useful in detecting blacks with renovascular hypertension, but this and other potential screening tests require further evaluation. 
Reversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm by intravenous flecainide. Spontaneous reversion to sinus rhythm is a frequent occurrence in recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF). In a randomized, double-blind, controlled study, intravenous flecainide (2 mg/kg, maximum dose 150 mg) was compared with placebo in the treatment of recent-onset AF (present for greater than or equal to 30 minutes and less than or equal to 72 hours' duration and a ventricular response greater than or equal to 120 beats/min). Intravenous digoxin (500 micrograms) was administered concurrently to all patients in both groups who had not previously taken digoxin. The trial medication was administered over 30 minutes. Exclusion criteria included hemodynamic instability, severe heart failure, recent antiarrhythmic therapy, hypokalemia and pacemaker dependence. One hundred two consecutive patients with recent-onset AF were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in the intensive care or coronary care unit. Twenty-nine (57%) patients given flecainide and digoxin, but only 7 (14%) given placebo and digoxin, reverted to sinus rhythm in less than or equal to 1 hour after starting the trial medication infusion and remained in stable sinus rhythm (chi-square 18.9, p = 0.000013; odds ratio 8.3, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 24.8). At the end of the 6-hour monitoring period, 34 patients (67%) in the flecainide-digoxin group were in stable sinus rhythm, whereas only 18 patients (35%) in the placebo-digoxin group had reverted (chi-square 8.83, p = 0.003; odds ratio 3.67, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 9.1). 
Quadrantic visual field defects. A hallmark of lesions in extrastriate (V2/V3) cortex. We report 2 patients with homonymous quadrantic visual field defects. The first patient experienced scintillations in the left lower quadrant, leading to the discovery of an astrocytoma in the cuneus of the right occipital lobe. Postoperatively she had a left lower quadrantanopia that precisely respected the horizontal meridian. The second patient presented with a left lower quadrantanopia, sparing the central 10 degrees of vision that also respected the horizontal meridian. An astrocytoma was resected from the right upper peristriate cortex. We must explain how a lesion in extrastriate cortex produced a homonymous field defect with a sharp horizontal edge in these 2 patients. Areas V2 and V3 are each divided along the horizontal meridian into separate halves flanking striate cortex. Consequently, the upper and lower quadrants in extrastriate cortex are physically isolated on opposite sides of striate cortex. We propose that a lesion involving V2/V3 may be sufficient to create a visual field defect. Although the lesion may have irregular margins, if it crosses the representation of the horizontal meridian in extrastriate cortex, it will produce a quadrantic visual field defect with a sharp horizontal border because of the split layout of the upper and lower quadrants in V2/V3. 
Effectiveness of recombinant desulphatohirudin in reducing restenosis after balloon angioplasty of atherosclerotic femoral arteries in rabbits BACKGROUND. The effectiveness of balloon angioplasty is limited by a restenosis rate of approximately 30%. Recombinant desulphatohirudin (r-hirudin [CGP 39393]) has been found to be highly effective in preventing acute platelet-rich thrombosis after deep arterial injury as compared with heparin. METHODS AND RESULTS. This study evaluated the effect of intravenous r-hirudin, a selective inhibitor of thrombin, on restenosis after balloon angioplasty in 29 rabbits. Focal femoral atherosclerosis was induced by air desiccation endothelial injury followed by a 2% cholesterol diet for 1 month. At angioplasty (2.5-mm balloon with three 60-second, 10-atm inflations 60 seconds apart), the rabbits received heparin (150 units/kg bolus, n = 16) or r-hirudin (1 mg/kg bolus followed by infusions of 1 mg/kg for the first hour and 0.5 mg/kg for the second hour, n = 13). Angiograms performed before and after angioplasty and before death were analyzed quantitatively by a blinded observer. Rabbits were killed 2 hours (n = 14) or 28 days (n = 15) after angioplasty. Femoral arteries were fixed in situ by perfusion of 10% formaldehyde at 100 mm Hg. The mean luminal diameter of the arteries with successful angioplasty (greater than or equal to 20% increase in luminal diameter) in rabbits treated with heparin (n = 8 arteries) increased from 1.18 +/- 0.29 mm before angioplasty to 1.86 +/- 0.24 mm immediately after angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and decreased to 0.94 +/- 0.69 mm (p = 0.0004) at 28 days after angioplasty. In rabbits treated with r-hirudin (n = 11 arteries), the mean luminal diameter increased from 1.14 +/- 0.17 mm before angioplasty to 1.68 +/- 0.20 mm immediately after angioplasty (p less than 0.001) and decreased to 1.37 +/- 0.47 mm (p = 0.01) at 28 days after angioplasty. The mean reduction in luminal diameter by angiography was less in the r-hirudin-treated group than in the heparin-treated group (0.30 +/- 0.33 versus 0.92 +/- 0.61 mm, p = 0.01). Blinded planimetric analysis of stained histological sections of the femoral arteries also showed less cross-sectional area narrowing by plaque in rabbits treated with r-hirudin compared with those treated with heparin (22 +/- 16% verus 48 +/- 29%, p = 0.01). Both groups had similar numbers of arteries with histological evidence of balloon-induced plaque tear (12 of 13 versus 13 of 15). CONCLUSIONS. Rabbits receiving r-hirudin at the time of experimental balloon angioplasty had significantly less restenosis by angiography and by quantitative histopathology than rabbits receiving heparin. 
High-attenuation mediastinal masses on unenhanced CT. On unenhanced CT scans, a variety of mediastinal masses contain areas with attenuation values higher than the attenuation value of the chest wall musculature. The increased attenuation may be diffuse or focal and may be a result of calcium deposition, high iodine content, or areas of acute hemorrhage. This report illustrates the gamut of high-attenuation mediastinal masses seen on unenhanced CT. Masses that are of high attenuation only on IV contrast-enhanced images (e.g., aberrant vessels) are not included. 
Growth of human breast cancer cell lines is inhibited by the somatostatin analog BIM23014. Somatostatin has been shown to lower plasma levels of various hormones and growth factors involved in regulation of the growth of human breast cells. In the present study we examined the ability of the somatostatin octapeptide analog BIM23014 to modulate the in vitro growth of five human breast cell lines: HBL100, Hs578T, MDAMB231, T47D, and MCF7. BIM23014 inhibited the growth of the two steroid-dependent cell lines, MCF7 and T47D, in a dose-related manner. This inhibitory effect was only observed when MCF7 and T47D cells were cultivated in medium containing steroid-depleted serum. The growth of a MCF7 variant capable of growth in serum-free medium was also inhibited by BIM23014, indicating that serum factors are not required for this inhibition. In the serum-free medium, the addition of estradiol before or during treatment with BIM23014 abolished its inhibitory effects on cell growth. The studies including time course, competitive inhibition, and cross-linking of iodinated BIM23014 to its receptor revealed a specific binding on MCF7 cells and showed a single 57,000 mol wt protein band in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These results support the hypothesis that BIM23014 inhibits the growth of steroid-receptor positive cells of human breast cancers through its own receptor in estradiol-free conditions. 
Coronary vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage as a cause of stunned myocardium. Case report. A patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage was found to have electrocardiographic abnormalities resembling an acute myocardial infarction as well as left ventriculographic findings of cardiac dysfunction. These cardiac abnormalities resolved following surgical clipping of the aneurysm and the patient recovered well from the operation. She died 2 months later from cancer and a postmortem examination at that time revealed no evidence of myocardial necrosis. In this report, the authors discuss coronary vasospasm and reversible postischemic "stunned myocardium," a condition that has not been considered previously in relation to subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Hypertrophy and increased gene expression of neurons containing neurokinin-B and substance-P messenger ribonucleic acids in the hypothalami of postmenopausal women. We have previously described hypertrophy of neurons containing estrogen receptor mRNA in the infundibular nucleus of postmenopausal women. In the present investigation we identified peptide mRNAs in the hypertrophied neurons and determined whether postmenopausal neuronal hypertrophy was accompanied by changes in gene expression. In the first study in situ hybridization was performed on sections from hypothalami of postmenopausal women (n = 3) using synthetic 35S-labeled cDNA probes complementary to mRNAs encoding estrogen receptor, substance-P (SP), neurokinin-B (NKB), POMC, cholecystokinin, dynorphin, CRF, enkephalin, galanin, neuropeptide-Y, GH-releasing hormone, and tyrosine hydroxylase. Neuronal cross-sectional areas and cell densities were measured with the aid of a computer microscope system. Neurons labeled with the NKB and SP probes were comparable in size, morphology, and distribution to the hypertrophied neurons containing estrogen receptor mRNA. In contrast, neurons labeled with other cDNA probes were sparsely distributed (CRF and dynorphin), smaller in size (neuropeptide-Y, galanin, GH-releasing hormone, enkephalin, cholecystokinin, and POMC), or located anterior to the hypertrophied population (tyrosine hydroxylase). In the second study sections from hypothalami of premenopausal (n = 3) and postmenopausal (n = 3) women were incubated with cDNA probes complementary to SP or NKB mRNAs. The mean cross-sectional areas of postmenopausal infundibular neurons containing NKB and SP mRNAs increased to 194% and 176% of premenopausal values, respectively. The autoradiographic grain densities of infundibular neurons labeled with either probe were also significantly increased in the postmenopausal group. Finally, the numbers of labeled neurons/tissue increased 6-fold (SP) and 15-fold (NKB) in the postmenopausal infundibular nucleus. These data demonstrate that human menopause is associated with marked increases in hypothalamic NKB and SP gene expression. We propose that neurons containing estrogen receptor, SP, and NKB mRNAs participate in the hypothalamic circuitry regulating estrogen negative feedback in the human. 
Relation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin: a case-control study. We conducted a case-control study in five general hospitals in the region of Antwerp, studying 161 patients (102 men, 59 women) and hospital control subjects matched for age and sex to explore the relation between drug use and upper gastrointestinal bleeding from 'erosive lesions' (peptic oesophagitis, gastric erosions, gastric ulcer(s), or duodenal ulcer(s]. There was a highly significant difference between cases and control subjects in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, excluding aspirin) (odds ratio 7.4, p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval odds ratio 3.7 to 14.7). There also was a significant difference in the use of aspirin (odds ratio 2.2, p = 0.025; 95% CI odds ratio 1.3 to 4.0) and a highly significant difference regarding the presence of antecedents of peptic ulcer disease (odds ratio 5.5, p less than 0.001; 95% CI odds ratio 3.2 to 9.6). There was no significant difference in the use of other drugs, paracetamol and corticosteroids in particular, nor in the use of alcohol or tobacco. The patient group using NSAIDs was older, had more women, and had a higher mortality than the group not using NSAIDs. Among patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer(s), NSAID users were not more or less likely to have had symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, and had no higher frequency of multiple gastric or duodenal ulcers. The attributable risk for NSAID use was 0.30 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.37) and for aspirin use 0.14 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.20). 
Coronary arteriography in patients with dextrocardia. Coronary arteriography is described in a patient with dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis. Six cases of coronary arteriography in dextrocardia were reviewed from the literature, and 3 other cases were reported from the authors' institutions. In 9 of the 10 patients, coronary arteriography was performed without difficulty using standard Judkins or Sones catheters. Angiographers encountering patients with dextrocardia may use standard coronary arteriographic techniques with a few subtle modifications. 
Renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement. Renal cell carcinoma extends into the lumen of the inferior vena cava in approximately 4% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of the intracaval tumor thrombus with radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for this malignancy. From January 1977 to June 1990, 31 such patients were examined for combined problems of renal carcinoma and intracaval tumor extension. Twenty-six of these patients underwent radical nephrectomy and vena caval thrombectomy. Ten patients had tumor thrombus confined to the infrahepatic vena cava, 11 had retrohepatic caval involvement, and 5 had extension to the level of the diaphragm or into the right atrium. Surgical approach was dictated by the level of caval involvement. Control of the suprahepatic vena cava plus temporary occlusion of hepatic arterial and portal venous inflow were necessary in some cases; cardiopulmonary bypass was required for transatrial removal of more extensive tumors. Five of the 26 patients had evidence before operation of distant metastatic disease; none of these survived beyond 12 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of the 21 patients without known preoperative metastatic disease was 57%. Complete surgical excision of all gross tumor appears to be critical for long-term survival in these patients. 
Gastric cancer after gastric bypass for obesity. Case report. We describe a patient in whom gastric cancer developed after gastric bypass for morbid obesity. In addition, we review the literature to emphasize the technical problems involved in diagnosing disease in the excluded portion of the stomach. 
Depressed adenoma of the stomach. Conceptual review and study of five cases. Depressed gastric adenoma is a recently featured lesion, distinguished by a depression in the gastric mucosa, with histologic changes of conventional adenomatous polyp. We observed five cases of depressed gastric adenoma, one of them associated with a peptic ulcer, another with a gastric stump, and yet another with an early gastric carcinoma. None of the cases was detected clinically by radiology or endoscopic study. Endoscopically, this lesion stimulates a peptic ulcer at a re-epithelialization stage or an early carcinoma of the depressed type. Histologically, all the cases showed dysplastic changes of varying degrees, with a relevant risk of malignancy. A similarity is shown to other lesions described in the gastric mucosa. 
Maxillofacial considerations in orthotopic liver transplantation. Orthotopic liver transplantation is now a widely used treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. Lifelong pharmacologic immunosuppression renders these patients susceptible to many infections. The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines for treating the patient with end-stage liver disease, both before and after transplantation. In addition, we shall discuss some of the medical implications associated with end-stage liver disease and their clinical presentations and appropriate presurgical management. Adverse side effects of long-term immunosuppression and their effect on the oral and maxillofacial region shall also be discussed. Last, a brief discussion of FK506, the latest immunosuppressant, will be presented together with the implications of its use on our surgical treatment of these patients. 
Prevalence of asthma among 12 year old children in New Zealand and South Wales: a comparative survey. A survey of 12 year old schoolchildren was carried out in New Zealand and South Wales, the same questionnaire and exercise provocation test being used. The prevalence of a history of asthma at any time was higher in New Zealand (147/873, 17%) than in South Wales (116/965, 12%). The New Zealand children were also more likely than the Welsh children to have a history of "wheeze ever" (27% versus 22%), and wheeze brought on by running (15% versus 10.5%). The sex ratio of asthmatic and wheezy children was very similar in the two countries. A history of hospital admission for chest trouble was twice as common in New Zealand as in South Wales. An exercise test produced a fall in peak expiratory flow rate of 15% or more in more New Zealand children (12.2%) than Welsh children (7.7%). These results suggest that the prevalence of childhood asthma is higher in New Zealand than in South Wales. 
Proliferation and cytolytic function of anti-CD3 + interleukin-2 stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells following bone marrow transplantation. We evaluated the proliferation, cytolytic function, and phenotypic characteristics of anti-CD3 plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 44 patients with leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) treated with multiagent chemotherapy or following bone marrow transplantation (BMT). BMT patients had decreased cell growth with only a 1.35 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ALL]), 1.24 +/- 0.25 (autologous BMT for NHL), and 0.8 +/- 0.1 (allogeneic BMT for leukemia) mean fold increase by day 5 of culture compared with controls (4.0 +/- 0.4), P less than .001. Anti-CD3 + IL-2 activated cells from patients with ALL and NHL who had received autologous BMT and cells from patients with leukemia who underwent allogeneic BMT were more effective in lysing the natural killer (NK) sensitive target, K562, and the NK-resistant target, Daudi, compared with controls. In contrast, cytolysis of K562 and Daudi by cultured PBMCs from patients with ALL and NHL receiving multi-agent chemotherapy was similar to that of controls. Cultures from BMT recipients had a significant increase in CD16+ (autologous ALL 5.7 +/- 1.5%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 12.4 +/- 3.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 14.3 +/- 2.9%, P less than .001) and CD56+ cells (autologous ALL 27.6 +/- 12.0%, P less than .01; autologous NHL 39.3 +/- 9.5%, P less than .001; allogeneic 42.7 +/- 7.4%, P less than .001) compared with controls (CD16+ 2.5 +/- 0.4%; CD56+ 6.9 +/- 0.9%). Stimulation of PBMCs with anti-CD3 + IL-2 is effective in generating cells with high cytolytic function post-BMT. 
The management of transitional cell carcinoma in solitary renal units. Ten patients with urothelial malignancies involving a solitary functioning renal unit were treated at our center for an average of 24 months or until death. These patients were all managed by parenchyma-sparing methods, including percutaneous as well as ureteroscopic tumor resection. Of our patients 9 have received adjunctive chemotherapy in the form of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations. At the time of this report 5 of our patients were alive without evidence of disease, 4 were alive with evidence of either residual or recurrent neoplasia and 1 was dead of disease 5 years after original presentation. Patients with higher grade tumors or carcinoma in situ did less well than patients with low grade disease. We present an analysis of our experience with this complex patient population and discuss the implications of these data within the context of a growing literature on the topic of upper tract urothelial malignancy. 
Perioperative stroke. Part I: General surgery, carotid artery disease, and carotid endarterectomy. Although stroke, defined as a focal neurological deficit lasting more than 24 hr, is uncommon in the perioperative period, its associated mortality and long-term disability are high. No large-scale data are available to identify the importance of recognized risk factors for stroke in the perioperative period. A review of the literature shows that the incidence and mechanism of its occurrence are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease and the type of surgery. The most common cause of perioperative stroke is embolism. In non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative stroke is higher among the elderly. Properly administered, controlled hypotension is associated with minimal risk of stroke. Cerebral vasospasm may be the cause of focal cerebral ischaemia in eclamptic patients, and the aggressive treatment of hypertension may exacerbate the neurological damage. The risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy is closely related to the preoperative neurological presentation, and the experience of the surgical/anaesthetic team. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke, asymptomatic carotid lesions, preoperative assessment of risk, local and general anaesthesia, cerebral protection and monitoring during carotid endarterectomy are discussed with reference to reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Adequate monitoring and protection have minimized the risk of ischaemia from carotid clamping, and the major mechanism of stroke is embolization. 
Restenosis after coronary angioplasty: an overview. Despite substantial basic and clinical efforts to address the problem of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention, effective preventive therapies have not yet been developed. Nevertheless, the accumulated information has provided much insight into the process of restenosis in addition to allowing standards to be developed for adequate clinical trials. The pathophysiology of restenosis increasingly appears to be distinct from that of primary atherosclerosis. Restenosis involves elastic recoil, incorporation of thrombus into the lesion and fibrocellular proliferation in varying degrees in different patients. Lack of an animal model that satisfactorily mimics restenosis is a major impediment to further understanding of the process. Clinical studies are hampered by difficulties in finding a single unifying definition of restenosis and by variable methods of reporting follow-up. Reporting of clinical outcomes of all patients in angiographic substudies would allow a more satisfactory interpretation of the results of clinical trials. Current noninvasive test results are not accurate enough to substitute for angiographic and clinical outcome data in intervention trials. In the majority of observational studies, only diabetes and unstable angina have emerged as consistently associated with restenosis; whereas most of the standard risk factors for atherosclerosis have a less consistent relation. Disappointingly, the new atherectomy and laser technologies have not affected restenosis rates. The one possible exception is coronary stenting, as a result of the larger luminal diameter achieved by the placement of the stent. In conclusion, although substantial continued effort is necessary to explore the basic aspects of cellular proliferation and mechanical alteration of atherosclerotic vessels, attention to the principles of clinical trials and observation are required to detect the impact of risk factors and interventions on the multifactorial problem of restenosis. Adequate sample sizes, collection of clinical and angiographic outcomes and factorial study designs hold promise for unraveling this important limitation of percutaneous intervention. 
Crescentic glomerulonephritis in Wegener's granulomatosis: morphology, therapy, outcome. Fourteen patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and severe renal and extrarenal involvement were studied (serum creatinine on admission 5.8 +/- 3.4 mg/dl). Renal histology showed a necrotizing, crescentic glomerulonephritis in all patients. Despite advanced renal disease on admission cyclophosphamide, steroids (in 13 patients) and plasma exchange (in 9 patients) caused a rapid and sustained improvement of renal function. Four patients required intermittent hemodialysis over a period of one week. After 2 weeks of treatment serum creatinine values below 2 mg/dl (n = 4) indicated a nearly complete recovery of renal function in the long-term follow up (mean serum creatinine achieved after 12 months therapy: 1.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl (n = 4). Therefore serum creatinine values observed after 2 weeks of therapy, appear to be of prognostic value with regard to renal outcome. No relapse of active WG or progressive renal deterioration was observed during follow-up (22 +/- 13 months) except in one patient with persisting renal impairment. Three patients died (staphylococcus sepsis, intracerebral hemorrhage during hypertensive crisis, pulmonary embolism) during the first two months of therapy. The decline of serum creatinine seemed to be a better indicator of successful therapy than the decrease of anticytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hematuria. On admission ANCA titer neither correlated with serum creatinine, the degree of renal involvement, nor was it of prognostic value. ANCA, serum creatinine and hematuria normalized within 2 to 8 months, whereas ESR and proteinuria remained elevated. Our data indicate a good prognosis of WG even with advanced renal involvement and generalized vasculitis provided aggressive treatment is performed early. 
The Istituto Rizzoli-Beretta experience with osteosarcoma of the jaw. Twenty-eight osteosarcomas (OS) of the jaw were reported. There were 15 male and 13 female patients (age range, 9 to 68 years; mean, 36.9 years); 57.1% of the patients were older than 30 years of age. Swelling was the most frequent symptom; it was reported on an average of 6 months before diagnosis. Most of the tumors of the maxilla (eight patients) occurred in the alveolar ridge (six of eight). In the mandible (20 patients), the body was the preferred site (11 of 20). Radiographically most of the lesions were either lytic and sclerotic or only lytic. Histologically, 12 cases (42.9%) were osteoblastic osteosarcoma, ten (35.8%) were chondroblastic, four (14.3%) were fibroblastic, and two (7%) were round cell OS. Of the 28 cases, three (10.7%) were low grade, and 25 (89.3%) were high grade. Thirteen patients had intralesional surgery, and 13 had marginal surgery as their initial treatment. Recurrence was the rule in the first group, and it was 69% in the second group. Twenty patients (71%) died, and eight are alive. Of these, two are alive with disease. In the six patients who are alive and disease-free, all but one had marginal to wide surgical margins at the time of the first procedure or wide margins at the time of the recurrences along with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In the patient in which the surgical margins were marginal, the lesion was small 2.5 X 2 cm. This patient was alive without evidence of disease after 9 years of follow-up. 
Accuracy of a mixed venous saturation catheter during acutely induced changes in hematocrit in humans. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of in vivo mixed venous hemoglobin saturation (Svo2) measurements with a fiber optic thermodilution catheter during acute changes in hematocrit. DESIGN: Comparison of fiberoptic in vivo Svo2 values with in vitro Svo2 values obtained with a multiwavelength spectrophotometer. SETTING: Operating room in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Six consecutive patients who are Jehovah's Witnesses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Before and after each step of hypervolemic hemodilution and after every 500 mL of blood loss, blood gases were analyzed and hemodynamic, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and in vitro and in vivo Svo2 measurements were made. Hematocrit values were measured in the range of 40% to 18%. Plotting all in vivo Svo2 values (n = 74) against the in vitro Svo2 measurements obtained during the entire study period gives r2 = .86. The accuracy of in vivo Svo2 measurements was not affected by changes in hematocrit or cardiac output. The Svo2 catheter value at the beginning of the study differed from the in vitro Svo2 value by -0.86 +/- 2.56% and at the end of the study period of 8 to 10 hrs by 0.71 +/- 3.04%. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of the studied fiberoptic continuous measuring Svo2 system was not affected by changes in hematocrit or cardiac output. No significant drift in the in vitro Svo2 measurements was observed. 
Valproate in the treatment of persistent chronic daily headache. An open label study. Thirty patients with persistent chronic daily headache, unresponsive to various combinations of pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment were selected for an open label study using divalproex sodium. All patients had normal liver function tests. After a baseline observation period of 1 month, patients were given divalproex sodium 1000 to 2000 mg per day, for a period of 3 months. Blood valproic acid levels were kept between 75 and 100 mcg/ml. Liver function studies and blood ammonia levels were obtained periodically. Based on weekly headache index, headache-free days, dysfunctional days and patients' general well-being rating and physicians' global assessment, two thirds of the patients improved significantly. The common side effects included weight gain, tremor, hair loss and nausea. Liver functions were unaffected by treatment. The possible mechanism of action of valproate in headache is discussed. Valproate appears to be a worthwhile addition to the prophylactic treatment of chronic recurrent headache. 
Normal P300 following extensive damage to the left medial temporal lobe. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during auditory and visual "oddball" tasks from a patient with a severe verbal memory deficit due to a low grade infiltrating glioma which involved the full extent of the left medial temporal lobe. In both sensory modalities, the patient's oddball-evoked P300s were symmetrical and of normal amplitude. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the hippocampus, or any other medial temporal structure, makes a substantial contribution to the scalp P300. 
Acid secretory changes and early relapse following duodenal ulcer healing with ranitidine or sucralfate. Controversial aspects relating to acid secretory changes following duodenal ulcer healing, and the effect of histamine-2 (H2)-receptor blockers on such changes are discussed. Recent studies comparing the effects of ranitidine or sucralfate on changes in the acid secretory responses in the healing of duodenal ulcers are described, and the relevance of these changes to early relapse considered. The duration of therapy and timing of acid-secretory studies and endoscopies are standardized in all studies, but the acid-secretory parameters vary. These comprised acid secretory responses to graded doses of an intravenous infusion of pentagastrin or histamine, sham-feeding responses, and basal and nocturnal acid secretion. In all studies, healing with sucralfate was associated with a significant decrease in the various parameters of acid secretion. In the ranitidine-healed groups, no appreciable decrease was noted and there was, indeed, a significant increase in nocturnal acid secretion. Routine endoscopies performed 4-6 weeks after documented ulcer healing showed a recurrence of 3 of the 32 (9%) sucralfate-healed and in 14 of the 35 (40%) ranitidine-healed ulcers. Increased acid secretory responsiveness following duodenal ulcer healing was strongly correlated with subsequent early relapse. 
Multicentric osteolysis: an infrequently recognized renal-rheumatologic syndrome. We describe the case of a young girl with Type III multicentric osteolysis, a rare syndrome characterized by osteolysis and renal insufficiency. Our report is intended to make physicians aware of this uncommon cause of renal and rheumatologic abnormalities. 
Management of low-grade cervical dysplasia during pregnancy. Fifty-five pregnant patients referred to my colposcopy service from 1985 to 1990 for biopsy-proven mild dysplasia were entered into a program of serial evaluations, including Pap test, colposcopy, and directed biopsy if indicated. The evaluations were done every 12 weeks during pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum to rule out new or occult invasive cervical cancer. By the time the postpartum biopsy was done, no such cancer had been detected. All 55 patients had mild dysplasia or less. I conclude that pregnant patients with biopsy-proven mild cervical dysplasia who have had adequate expert colposcopy and results of Pap test consistent with biopsy require only one antepartum colposcopy prior to postpartum reevaluation and treatment. Multiple interval cytologic and colposcopic studies with or without biopsy are unnecessary. The likelihood of invasive cervical cancer developing in these patients during pregnancy is negligible. 
Transcortical aphasia. Importance of the nonspeech dominant hemisphere in language repetition. While a relative preservation of repetition in acute transcortical aphasia (TA) has usually been associated with the functional integrity of the speech dominant (left) perisylvian area, recent amytal data (Bando et al., 1986) have suggested a fundamental role of the nondominant (right) hemisphere in language repetition. The neuroradiological correlates of repetition were studied in a consecutive series of 21 patients with acute TA. A similar frequency of either perisylvian or extraperisylvian pathology was found. In 2 patients with perisylvian pathology, the injection of amytal in the hemisphere contralateral to the lesion abolished repetition. Positron emission tomography (PET) in another patient revealed marked hypometabolism over the entire left cortical mantle ipsilateral to a basal ganglia lesion, suggesting that preserved repetition was carried out by right hemisphere structures. This was confirmed in a second patient with left extraperisylvian pathology, in whom a second lesion in the right hemisphere resulted in impaired repetition. These findings suggest that the spared contralateral hemisphere may subserve residual repetition in some transcortical aphasic patients with a lesion within or outside the speech-dominant perisylvian area. 
Retinal detachment adherent to posterior chamber IOL after Molteno implant surgery. A patient with refractory glaucoma 1 year after cataract extraction and trabeculectomy had Molteno implant surgery. Three days after surgery a kissing choroidal effusion and retinal detachment adherent to the posterior chamber IOL were detected. Repeated choroidal taps were unsuccessful. Removal of the Molteno implant, vitrectomy, and silicone oil injection were required to reattach the retina. 
Desmoplastic small cell tumors of the peritoneum coexpressing mesenchymal and epithelial markers. Desmoplastic small cell tumors arising diffusely within the abdomen and lacking an apparent organ of origin are rare. Most previously reported cases occurred in children, but young adult patients also have been described. Light microscopic examination shows the tumors to be composed of nests of small cells surrounded by an abundant desmoplastic stroma. Immunohistochemical findings reveal multidirectional differentiation with coexpression of cytokeratin, milk fat globule, neuron-specific enolase, Leu-7, desmin, and vimentin. Electron microscopic examination demonstrates paranuclear condensations of intermediate filaments. The authors describe two patients who died of their disease, despite aggressive chemotherapy and surgical intervention. 
Detection of hepatitis B virus DNA sequences in liver in HBsAg seronegative patients with liver disease with and without anti-HBc antibodies. Excluding studies from Brechot and co-workers, little support has been found for a role of the hepatitis B virus in the pathogenesis of HBsAg seronegative patients with predominantly chronic liver diseases, including primary liver cancer. In this study liver DNA from 59 predominantly British patients (four cases with paired biopsies, 6-12 months apart) with different, mostly chronic, liver diseases was analysed by molecular hybridization. All were seronegative for HBsAg and serum hepatitis B virus DNA (dot blot hybridization) and their liver diseases were believed to be unrelated to hepatitis B virus infection. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in liver of 11 (18.6 per cent) patients; nine had episomal (3.2 Kb) DNA and eight had higher molecular weight bands suggesting integrated forms. Six patients were also seronegative for anti-HBc. Patients of UK and non-UK origin were equally represented. Hepatitis B virus DNA was detected in serum of six of nine patients tested using the polymerase chain reaction. The detection of hepatitis B virus DNA in liver and in serum by this assay in a significant proportion of patients with chronic liver disease, hitherto unsuspected of being hepatitis B virus-related, suggests a possible role for this virus in low- as well as high-prevalence countries. 
Impairment of natural killer functions by interleukin 6 increases lymphoblastoid cell tumorigenicity in athymic mice. Expression of the human IL-6 gene in EBV-immortalized normal human B lymphocytes following retroviral-mediated transduction rendered these cells highly tumorigenic in athymic mice. The tumors were lymphomas composed of the originally inoculated human lymphoblastoid cells. Co-injection of IL-6 expressing EBV-immortalized cells with IL-6 nonexpressing control cells resulted in increased tumorigenicity of the IL-6 nonexpressing cells. The lymphoblastoid cells expressing IL-6 were indistinguishable from parental cell lines in morphology and in a variety of cell surface characteristics, and did not exhibit growth advantage over parental cell lines in vitro, such that increased tumorigenicity is unlikely to depend upon a direct oncogenic effect of IL-6 on the B cells. Rather, at high concentrations, IL-6 markedly inhibits human lymphoblastoid cell killing by IL-2-activated murine splenocytes in vitro, suggesting that IL-6-related tumorigenicity might depend upon IL-6 inhibiting cytotoxicity at the tumor site. Thus, production of IL-6 by tumor cells that results in natural killer cell dysfunctions illustrates a novel mechanism of tumor cell escape from immune surveillance. 
Racial differences in HLA antigen frequency and hypertensive renal failure. Black patients with hypertension are six times more likely to develop end-stage renal disease than are their white counterparts. To determine if genetic differences associated with the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) system account for racial variation in hypertensive renal failure, we examined antigenic frequencies from a large renal transplant registry. Human Leukocyte Antigen phenotypes from cadaveric renal transplant recipients and donors in the South Eastern Organ Procurement Foundation database from 1982 to 1986 were analyzed. One thousand six hundred four renal transplant recipients with hypertensive renal failure as the cause of end stage renal disease (cases) were compared with 4506 race-matched cadaveric kidney donors (controls). Log-linear models were used to assess the relationship between hypertensive renal failure and prevalence of each HLA phenotype. Bonferroni adjustments of P values were used to correct for multiple comparisons. Comparison of HLA frequencies between blacks and whites with hypertensive renal failure demonstrated that blacks had an increased frequency of HLA-DR3 beyond that normally known to exist between black and white populations. Black cases compared to black controls had an 8.6% increase in HLA-DR3 frequency contrasted with a 1.6% decrease in the frequency of this antigen between white cases and white controls. This absolute 10.2% difference between the races was significant (P = .02) because the control black and white populations had nearly identical frequencies for this antigen. White cases compared to white controls had lower HLA-A1 and B8 frequencies (21.2% v 30.6%, P = .0005 and 13.7% v 22.3%, P = .001, respectively) and a greater HLA-B35 frequency (20.7% v 14.2%, P = .02). 
Later recurrence and longer survival among obese patients with renal cell carcinoma. To investigate the effect of obesity at diagnosis on prognosis of renal cell carcinoma, 360 renal cell carcinoma patients newly diagnosed at 29 hospitals in Oklahoma between January 1, 1981 and December 31, 1984 were followed through December 31, 1987. The Cox proportional-hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio, adjusting for other potentially prognostic factors. Both the disease-free interval and the overall survival were longer in patients who were obese (greater than or equal to 120% standard body mass index) at diagnosis. The adjusted-hazard ratio for disease recurrence between obese and nonobese patients was 0.43 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19 to 0.98). The obese patients had an adjusted death hazard rate 0.68 times that of the nonobese patients (95% CI, 0.38 to 1.22). Although obesity was reported to increase the risk for renal cell carcinoma, prognosis was no worse and may be better among obese patients with the disease. 
Node negative breast cancer: the prognostic value of DNA ploidy for long-term survival. The DNA content of breast tumours from 170 patients who presented between 1978 and 1980 was measured by flow cytometry. The relationship between tumour ploidy and disease outcome was assessed and its association with other prognostic factors evaluated. Compared with those with diploid tumours, patients with aneuploid tumours had significantly earlier relapse and shorter survival (P less than 0.0001). Tumour ploidy was strongly related to grade (P less than 0.001), but there was no significant association between DNA ploidy and c-erb-B-2 expression, lymph node status or tumour size. In lymph node negative and c-erb-B-2 negative patients, aneuploid tumours were associated with a poorer prognosis (P less than 0.001) than diploid tumours. Multivariate analysis showed that tumour ploidy gave independent information on disease free and overall survival. Tumour ploidy may be used as an independent prognostic variable in patients with breast cancer and it may be helpful in defining patients within the node negative or c-erb-B-2 negative groups likely to have a poor outcome who might benefit from adjuvant treatment. 
Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. To determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may reduce the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we retrospectively identified 322 consecutive patients who underwent a successful procedure from June 1988 to December 1989. No patients developed chest pain, ST segment elevation, positive cardiac enzymes, or other evidence of abrupt vessel closure following the PTCA. All patients received intravenous heparin after PTCA and aspirin was begun on the day prior to PTCA. Patients were separated into two groups: those at hospital discharge incidentally treated for hypertension or heart failure with ACE inhibitors (n = 36), and those treated with a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors (n = 286). The two groups were similar with respect to age (61 +/- 13.5 vs. 60 +/- 12.5, p = NS) and other demographic characteristics. Restenosis, defined as the presentation to a physician with symptoms of angina within 6 months of the PTCA and the finding on repeat catheterization of a significant restenosis at the site of the PTCA, occurred in 30% of the patients who were discharged on a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors vs. 3% (p less than .05) in those treated with an ACE inhibitor. Thus, it appears that the use of ACE inhibitors may significantly reduce the incidence of restenosis after successful PTCA. 
Haemodynamic significance of incompetent calf perforating veins. A total of 149 consecutive unselected patients (221 limbs) who presented with signs and symptoms of chronic venous problems (varicose veins with or without ankle oedema, skin changes and leg ulcers) have been studied by clinical examination, ascending deep to superficial venography, Doppler ultrasound and ambulatory venous pressure measurements. Of the limbs, 180 (82 per cent) had varicose veins without obstruction in the deep veins or reflux in the popliteal or femoral veins while 41 (18 per cent) had deep venous disease. Of the 180 limbs with 'primary' varicose veins 110 (60 per cent) did not have incompetent calf perforating veins (group A) while 70 (40 per cent) did (group B). On the basis of the ambulatory venous pressure after calf muscle exercise and the refilling time, the incompetent calf perforating veins of limbs in group B belonged to three subgroups of different haemodynamic significance. In 20 limbs (30 per cent) they were found to be of no haemodynamic significance, in 25 (35 per cent) of moderate haemodynamic significance and in 25 (35 per cent) of major haemodynamic significance. The last were, on clinical examination, indistinguishable from limbs with deep venous disease although they had patent deep veins with competent popliteal valves. 
Neonatal short bowel syndrome. In this retrospective study the management of infants who had undergone resection of more than 50% of the small bowel as newborn infants between 1970 and 1988 was analyzed to define prognostic factors. Small bowel resections were performed for atresia (36 cases), volvulus (22 cases), gastroschisis (10 cases), necrotizing enterocolitis (11 cases), and other disorders (8 cases). Patients were classified into two groups depending on the length of residual small bowel: group 1 (n = 35) had less than 40 cm of small bowel and group 2 (n = 51) had 40 to 80 cm of residual small bowel. Patients in group 2 had significantly better survival rates than those in group 1 (92.0% vs 66.6%; p less than 0.001). The patients in group 1 who were born after 1980, when home parenteral nutrition was introduced, had better survival rates than those who were treated before 1980 (95.0% vs 65.0%; p less than 0.01). The time required for acquisition of intestinal adaptation depended on the intestinal length (average, 27.3 months for group 1 and 14 months for group 2; p less than 0.01) and on the presence or absence of the ileocecal valve. Parenteral or supportive enteral nutrition, or both, ensured normal growth in both groups. We conclude that more than 90% of infants now survive after extensive small bowel resection with parenteral nutrition and that the remaining small intestine will adapt with time. Home-based parenteral nutrition allowed children to be treated in the best psychosocial environment. 
Nonpharmacological therapy of hypertension. Commentary on diet and blood pressure. The use of dietary measures as sole therapy for hypertension has generated much enthusiasm and is supported by epidemiological and anecdotal data but is not substantiated by long-term controlled trials. Dietary measures should be effective in preventing the rise in blood pressure with age in civilized populations, but there are no firm data to substantiate this hypothesis. However, some data do suggest that weight loss and sodium restriction may benefit the drug-treated hypertensive patient. There are strong reasons to consider the use of nonpharmacological measures for the treatment of mild hypertension. Mild hypertension is ubiquitous. Some population subsets have a prevalence of mild hypertension approaching 40%, based on one blood pressure determination, for individuals older than 50 years. Even if the true prevalence is closer to 15%, this is a high proportion of the population in need of drug therapy. If a change in lifestyle could reduce the need for drug therapy by a respectable percentage, then an enormous number of individuals could be spared the necessity of taking antihypertensive medication. 
Inhibition of endogenous superoxide dismutase with diethyldithiocarbamate in acute island skin flaps. Oxygen free radicals have been implicated in postischemic tissue damage in a variety of experimental models including the island skin flap. Previous studies have demonstrated that supplementing animals with exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD), a free radical scavenger, improves tissue survival in island flaps. No studies to our knowledge have attempted to inhibit endogenous SOD in a skin flap model. In this experiment 20 control rats demonstrated a 12.00% flap necrosis 7 days after a modified ventral island skin flap was raised. A second group of 20 rats were supplemented with exogenous SOD (50,000 U/kg 30 minutes preoperatively and 12 hours postoperatively) and demonstrated a statistically significant decreased flap necrosis of 5.28%. A third group of 20 rats received diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC, 0.5 gm/kg 12 hours preoperatively), an agent previously shown to inhibit SOD, and demonstrated a statistically significant increased flap necrosis of 19.77%. In a final group of 20 rats the effect of DDC was overcome by supplementation with exogenous SOD, obtaining a flap necrosis of 8.35%. Our results add further support to the importance of SOD and oxygen free radicals in postischemic tissue damage by demonstrating increased tissue necrosis with inhibition of endogenous SOD. This suggests that there is a baseline degree of SOD activity in ischemic areas working to preserve tissue. It appears that the copper-containing species of SOD found primarily in the cytoplasm plays a pivotal role in preservation of postischemic tissue. 
Acute and chronic symptoms of mononucleosis. BACKGROUND. The clinical symptoms and durations of illness of patients with infectious mononucleosis (IM) are variable and are poorly documented in the scientific literature. METHODS. Patients who presented for care at the Student Health Service of a Canadian university between September 1985 and May 1988 and had been diagnosed as having IM were surveyed. Health experience during the acute and convalescent phases of IM was compared with that of a group of patients matched for age, sex, date of diagnosis, and year of study, who had suffered acute upper respiratory tract infections (URI), other than Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced, during the same period. RESULTS. Students were sicker for longer after IM than after non-EBV-induced URI. During the acute phase of illness, the symptoms of fatigue (P = less than .000001), night sweats (P = .000001), and painful neck swelling (P = .00003) were seen significantly more often in the IM group. The severity and duration of these symptoms were also significantly worse in IM patients. Getting tired easily (P = .002), diurnal somnolence (P = .002), and depression (P = .002) were significantly more common postacute symptoms. Eleven percent of IM patients reported persistence of symptoms longer than 100 days, and in 6% of patients the symptoms had persisted after 1 year. Convalescent cases showed a trend toward reduced alcohol intake and, perhaps, reduced alcohol tolerance. CONCLUSIONS. IM involves excessive morbidity in a student community compared with URI that was other than EBV-induced, during both the acute and the postacute phases of infection. 
Analysis of septic morbidity following gunshot wounds to the colon: the missile is an adjuvant for abscess. Over a 7-year period, 151 patients with gunshot wounds to the colon surviving beyond 24 hours were managed. The bullet was retained in the body in 66% and exited in 34%. Thirty-four (23%) developed major septic complications (diffuse peritonitis, 21%; intraperitoneal abscesses 24%; and extraperitoneal abdominal abscesses, 56%). The septic complication rate was 26% in the bullet-present group compared with 16% in the remainder (p less than 0.15). The increased septic rate in those with bullets present was the result of abscesses developing around the retained missile. That group with missile abscesses had a lesser degree of injury as measured by the abdominal trauma index compared with the other patients with septic complications (p less than 0.001). Fifteen (79%) of the 19 patients with missile and missile track abscesses had them develop in the psoas muscle. These abscesses occur by fecal contamination of the muscle following inoculation by the bullet, which passes through the large bowel. Computed tomography-guided and operative drainage tend to fail if the foreign body is not removed. Computed tomography-guided or operative drainage should be successful in draining missile track abscesses when the bullet has exited the patient. 
Molecular characterization of a supratypic cross-reactive idiotype associated with IgM autoantibodies. Neoplastic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL) frequently express surface Ig reactive with the mouse mAb, Lc1. Raised against a human monoclonal IgM with rheumatoid factor activity, Lc1 detects a major cross-reactive Id (CRI) present on the H chain of many monoclonal IgM autoantibodies. In contrast to other major autoantibody-CRI investigated to date, we note that the Lc1-CRI is expressed by subpopulation of cells in the germinal centers, as well as in the mantle zones, of secondary human B cell follicles. To examine the molecular basis for Lc1 expression, we used the polymerase chain reaction to isolate the functionally rearranged Ig VH genes of monoclonal Lc1-reactive B cell populations from six unrelated patients with CLL or SLL. Although the neoplastic B cells from most patients with CLL or SLL express the CD5 surface differentiation Ag, the lymphoma cells from one patient with SLL were CD5-negative. We find that the Lc1-reactive cells from each cell population have Ig rearrangements involving a VH gene of the VH4 subgroup. However, the VH4 genes rearranged in different Lc1-reactive tumor populations may originate from at least two disparate germ-line VH4 genes. Also, in contrast to the CD5-positive tumor populations, we find evidence for intraclonal diversity in the functionally rearranged VH4 genes of the CD5-negative SLL. Collectively, this study discerns a degeneracy in the VH4 genes that can encode the Lc1 CRI, indicating the term "supratypic cross-reactive idiotype" may best describe the specificity of the Lc1 mAb. Also, this study suggests that expression of CD5 may delineate categories of B cell SLL that differ in their relative rates of constitutive Ig V gene somatic mutation. 
Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis in patients with acute leukemia. Invasive aspergillus rhinosinusitis is a potentially lethal complication of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in patients with acute leukemia. The majority of cases are caused by Aspergillus flavus. The infection is difficult to diagnose early but should be suspected when a neutropenic patient develops persistent fever without a known source, symptoms of rhinitis or sinusitis, cutaneous findings over the nose or sinuses, symptoms and signs of orbital or cavernous sinus disease, or an ulcerating lesion of the hard palate or gingiva. Careful anterior rhinoscopy followed by computed tomography of the sinus helps establish the diagnosis, which should be confirmed by histologic study and culture of biopsied material. Early treatment with aggressive surgery, high-dose amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine, and possibly white blood cell transfusions may produce a cure if the patient's bone marrow recovers. Newer antifungal agents offer promise for prophylaxis and treatment of this infection. 
Hemodynamic monitoring: a technology assessment. Technology Subcommittee of the Working Group on Critical Care, Ontario Ministry of Health. OBJECTIVE: To review catheterization of the right side of the heart according to technical capability, diagnostic accuracy, range of possible uses, therapeutic impact, benefit to patient outcome and impact on health care workers. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched for English-language articles published since 1962. Additional references were selected from the bibliographies of identified articles. STUDY SELECTION: Nonrandomized trials and retrospective reviews were included because of a paucity of randomized controlled trials. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: After a review of the data on hemodynamic monitoring by the subcommittee members, guidelines were developed through the use of the nominal group and Delphi consensus-gathering techniques. CONCLUSIONS: The use of catheterization of the right side of the heart for hemodynamic monitoring should be reserved for tertiary and secondary care hospitals, which are adequately staffed by physicians and nurses well versed in the use of such monitoring. Future research should be directed at determining whether the use of hemodynamic monitoring will improve outcomes among patients, especially those with myocardial infarction, septic shock or pulmonary edema. 
Cervical dystonia: clinical findings and associated movement disorders. We studied 300 patients, 61% women, with mean age 49.7 years and mean duration of dystonia 7.8 years, to determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of cervical dystonia (CD) and its relationships to other movement disorders. Torticollis was present in 82%, laterocollis in 42%, retrocollis in 29%, and anterocollis in 25%; however, the majority (66%) had a combination of these abnormal postures. Scoliosis was present in 39%, local pain reported by 68%, and 32% had evidence of secondary cervical radiculopathy. In addition to CD, 16% of patients had oral dystonia, 12% mandibular dystonia, 10% hand/arm dystonia, and 10% had blepharospasm. Tremor was noted in 71% of patients; head-neck tremor was present in 60%, and tremor in other body regions was present in 32%. A family history of a movement disorder was present in 44% of the CD patients. Tardive dystonia was the cause in 6%; 11% had posttraumatic dystonia. Anticholinergic drugs provided moderate improvement in 33% of patients, but local intramuscular botulinum toxin injections relieved CD, local pain, or both in over 90% of all treated patients. 
Na(+)-H+ exchanger and its role in essential hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The Na(+)-H+ exchanger is a ubiquitous transport system that is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH, cell growth and proliferation, cell volume regulation, and transepithelial absorption of Na+, Cl-, and HCO3-. Altered activity of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger has been implicated as a mechanism contributing to the development of high blood pressure in subgroups of patients with essential hypertension and in various animal models of hypertension. Many of these studies measured Na(+)-Li+ exchange rather than Na(+)-H+ exchange, hypothesizing that Na(+)-Li+ exchange represents a functional mode of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger. However, this is a controversial assumption. Several studies have also shown an association between erythrocyte Na(+)-Li(+)-exchange rate and predisposition to nephropathy in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The recent cDNA cloning of at least one isoform of the Na(+)-H+ exchanger will help clarify the cellular mechanisms of regulation of the exchanger and its possible role in pathophysiological states such as hypertension. 
Global T wave inversion. Because global T wave inversion has not been specifically characterized, 100 electrocardiograms (ECGs) with this pattern (frontal plane T vector -100 degrees to -170 degrees with precordial T inversion) were prospectively collected from approximately 30,000 consecutively interpreted ECGs and analyzed blindly. There was a striking female predominance (82 women vs. 18 men; p less than 0.0005) despite an essentially equal number of female and male hospital admissions. There was a single statistically significant ECG correlate: a more vertical QRS axis in women (+14.1 degrees +/- 45.3 degrees vs. -5.6 degrees +/- 31.3 degrees; p = 0.034). The T waves were basically symmetric (68%), the influence of this factor usually altering the characteristically asymmetric T wave inversions of right bundle branch block (4 of 5) and left ventricular hypertrophy (21 of 36). Asymmetry was mainly associated with digoxin therapy (21 of 32 patients taking digoxin; p less than or equal to 0.0005) and a corrected QT (QTc) interval (0.433 +/- 0.095) shorter than with symmetric T wave inversions (0.507 +/- 0.074; p less than or equal to 0.0005) though not reaching the degree of shortening expected for digitalization. Twenty-eight patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction and 23 for a central nervous system disorder accounted for the majority of patients with symmetric T wave inversion. Fifteen of 18 patients who had coronary angiography had some degree of coronary artery disease: 3 had angiographically normal coronary arteries. 
Enteropathogens associated with acute diarrheal disease in urban infants in Sao Paulo, Brazil. To determine the prevalence and epidemiology of enteropathogens in acute infantile diarrhea, 500 infants less than or equal to 12 months of age with diarrhea and 500 age-matched control subjects coming to a Sao Paulo emergency room were studied. Enteropathogens were identified in 55% of case infants and 10% of controls; enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) of classic EPEC serotypes producing EPEC adherence factor (EAF) (26% of case infants), rotavirus (14%), Salmonella species (8%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (7%), and Shigella species (5%) were associated with diarrhea. Isolation of EAF+ classic EPEC decreased with increasing age of cases and peaked in spring, whereas rotavirus was least common in early infancy and peaked in fall and winter. Bloody stool had a 36% positive predictive value for Shigella infection, EAF+ classic EPEC were highly resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among poor Sao Paulo infants, EAF+ classic EPEC equaled or exceeded rotavirus throughout the year as a cause of diarrhea bringing children to medical attention. 
Gastritis due to spiral shaped bacteria other than Helicobacter pylori: clinical, histological, and ultrastructural findings. An intensive histological search for Helicobacter pylori in gastric biopsy specimens has led to the detection of other spiral shaped bacteria in the human gastric mucosa. The clinical and morphological findings of 39 cases (0.25% of all gastric biopsies performed in the observation period) are reported for 34 patients (87.2%) complaining of upper abdominal discomfort. Five patients (12.8%) had chronic gastritis and 34 (87.2%) chronic active gastritis. The organisms were seen by light microscopy deep in the gastric foveolae and intracellularly. The scanning and transmission electron microscopic findings show bacteria which invade and damage gastric mucosal cells. These organisms are similar to the spiral shaped bacteria found in the stomachs of cats and dogs and non-human primates. In eight patients organisms were not detected after four weeks of treatment with bismuth salts. The disappearance of the organisms coincided with resolution of the chronic active gastritis and the symptoms. 
J. Maxwell Chamberlain Memorial Paper. Role of staging in prognosis and management of thymoma. Eighty-five patients operated on for thymoma from 1972 to 1989 were evaluated, 32 with myasthenia gravis and 53 without. Masaoka staging revealed stage I disease in 45 (53%), stage II in 23 (27%), stage III in 14 (16%), and stage IVa in 3 (4%). There was no operative mortality. Actuarial survival at 10 years was 63.7% for all patients: 78.3% for those in stage I, 74.7% for those in stage II, and 20.8% for those in stage III. There was no recurrence in patients in stage I. Mediastinal recurrence developed in 4 patients in stage II considered to have noninvasive disease by the surgeon. It is recommended that all patients be followed up for a minimum of 10 years and that all patients in stages II and III receive postoperative radiotherapy. The presence of myasthenia gravis is no longer considered as an adverse factor in survival. 
Particle shedding and migration from silicone genitourinary prosthetic devices. Of 26 patients undergoing revision of genitourinary prostheses the surrounding reactive fibrous capsule was biopsied in 25 and the draining lymph nodes also were biopsied in 4. The prostheses included 16 inflatable and 14 flexible penile devices, and 10 artificial urinary sphincters. Tissue was examined by light and transmission electron microscopy. X-ray microanalysis was done on intracellular and extracellular foreign material from each specimen. Silicone was found in 18 of the 25 periprosthetic specimens and in all 4 lymph nodes. Foreign body granulomas were identified in 14 of these 29 specimens. Examination of new and explanted versions of each prosthesis by scanning electron microscopy revealed free particles of silicone or silicates on the surface of most devices. Pitting and microfissuring were seen on a few of the new devices and on nearly all of the used ones. Thus, genitourinary prostheses shed silicone particles that can be found in the fibrous capsule and draining lymph nodes. 
Hyperglycemia and neurological outcome in patients with head injury. To examine the relationship between serum glucose and the outcome of patients suffering from head injury, the authors retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of 169 patients admitted for treatment to Harborview Medical Center (a regional trauma center). All patients underwent craniotomy for evacuation of intracranial hematoma and/or placement of a subarachnoid bolt for intracranial pressure monitoring under general anesthesia. Patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less had significantly higher serum glucose levels than patients with GCS scores of 12 to 15 (mean +/- standard error of the mean 192 +/- 7 mg/dl vs. 130 +/- 8 mg/dl or 10.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter vs. 7.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter) (p less than 0.0001). Patients who subsequently remained in a vegetative state or died had significantly higher glucose levels both on admission and postoperatively than patients who had good outcome or moderate disability (217 +/- 12 mg/dl vs. 167 +/- 6 mg/dl or 12.1 +/- 0.7 mmol/liter vs. 9.3 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter on admission, and 240 +/- 16 mg/dl vs. 156 +/- 5 mg/dl or 13.3 +/- 0.9 mmol/liter vs. 8.9 +/- 0.3 mmol/liter postoperatively) (p less than 0.0001). Among the more severely injured patients (GCS score less than or equal to 8), a serum glucose level greater than 200 mg/dl (11.1 mmol/liter) postoperatively is associated with a significantly worse outcome (p less than 0.01). The authors conclude that severely head-injured patients frequently develop hyperglycemia and the elevated serum glucose level may aggravate ischemic insults and worsen the neurological outcome in such patients. 
Lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast: clinical, pathologic, and mammographic features. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) was diagnosed in 165 surgical specimens (119 patients) at our institution between 1974 and 1987. LCIS was seen more often in younger women (mean age, 49 years) than other breast carcinomas were (mean age, 58 years). Sampling of a single breast revealed multifocal disease in 70% (96/138). When both breasts were sampled, bilateral foci were found in 50% (41/82). Of 165 breasts with foci of LCIS, 37% (61/165) had simultaneously occurring invasive cancers in the same breast. Direct mammographic-pathologic correlation of foci of LCIS was possible in 73 breasts (67 patients). Microcalcifications were an indication for biopsy in 49% (20/41) of breasts with a mammographic abnormality, but were a nonspecific finding often found in tissues adjacent to foci of LCIS. The mammogram was normal in 44% (32/73) of breasts with foci of LCIS. The mammograms of patients with LCIS and those from a group of age-matched control subjects were compared by using a modified form of Wolfe's criteria and the percentage of fibroglandular elements. LCIS was seldom found in an N1 breast (1% vs 29%) or in a breast with less than 25% of its parenchymal area occupied by fibroglandular density (3% vs 33%). Compared with the control group, breasts with LCIS had more than 50% fibroglandular density (85% vs 45%) and a much higher frequency of the DY pattern (56% vs 36%). More fibroglandular density was seen in the LCIS group at all ages. Postmenopausally, the frequencies of the DY pattern and fibroglandular density greater than 50% in LCIS patients were nearly double those in the control group. LCIS patients have disease of the entire breast parenchyma, characterized by multifocality and bilaterality of various forms of lobular disease. Their mammograms reveal a higher rate of the DY pattern and higher percentages of fibroglandular or parenchymal density than those of age-matched controls. In LCIS patients, persistence of the DY pattern, or large amounts of fibroglandular density postmenopausally supports the concept that mammographically dense breasts are a marker for increased cancer risk in women 50 years old and older. 
Selective 2-[18F]fluorodopa uptake for melanogenesis in murine metastatic melanomas. The relationship between 3,4-dihydroxy-2-[18F]fluoro-L-phenylalanine (2-[18F]FDOPA) uptake and melanogenesis was studied using mice bearing two B16 melanomas: B16-F1 has a higher melanin synthesis ability and a slower growing rate than the higher metastatic B16-F10. A significantly higher 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake by B16-F1 than by B16-F10 and a reverse relationship for the uptake of [14C] 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose and [3H]thymidine were observed 1 hr postinjection. F1-to-F10 ratios of both the 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake and the acid-insoluble radioactivity increased to about 5 at 6 hr, which paralleled the melanin content. FM3A mammary carcinoma showed a 2-[18F]FDOPA uptake similar to the B16-F10 but without the acid-insoluble radioactivity. With D,L-DOPA loading, a 55% decreased uptake by FM3A 1 hr postinjection was significantly greater than the 20% reduction in both melanomas. O-Methylated 2-[18F]FDOPA was a predominant acid-soluble metabolite in all tumors. Whole-body autoradiography discriminated the two melanomas clearly. 2-[18F]FDOPA may be a promising tracer for the selective imaging of melanogenesis. 
Use of percutaneous nephrostomy in malignant ureteric obstruction. Seventeen patients with malignant disease underwent percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve renal failure secondary to ureteric obstruction. Renal function improved in 88%. The median survival time was 18 weeks and 58% left the primary hospital to return home or to a terminal care hospice. Minor complications occurred in 58%. The use of bilateral nephrostomy tubes conferred no greater benefit than a unilateral tube. Intervention in malignant ureteric obstruction may confer some benefit and should not necessarily be viewed with pessimism. 
Inhibition of burn pain by intravenous lignocaine infusion. Patients with burns often suffer severe pain, especially during dressing of wounds, but there are no established alternatives to potent opiate analgesics, with their various side-effects. Intravenous lignocaine infusion strikingly reduced self-assessed pain scores in 7 patients during the first 3 days after second-degree burns, without need for supplementary opiate analgesia. 
Acetylcholine receptor-reactive T and B cells in myasthenia gravis and controls. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is strongly associated with antibodies to acetylcholine receptor (AChR), whereas the extent of T cell involvement is not settled. The number of cells secreting interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in response to AChR during 48 h culture of blood mononuclear cells (PBL) may reflect AChR-reactive T cells. Using an immunospot assay, we detected such cells in 23 of 30 patients with MG at a mean number of 1 per 33.333 PBL. AChR-reactive T cells were also found in patients with other neurological diseases (OND) and in healthy subjects but at lower frequencies and numbers. The T cell response to purified protein derivative and to PHA, and also to two major myelin proteins (basic protein and proteolipid protein) did not differ between MG and the two control groups, underlining the specificity of an augmented T cell reactivity to AChR in MG. Evaluation of the B cell response by enumerating anti-AChR IgG antibody secreting cells revealed such cells in 27 of 28 patients with MG at a mean value of 1 per 14,085 PBL. Cells secreting anti-AChR antibodies of the IgA and IgM isotypes were also detected in MG, but less frequently, at lower numbers, and only in conjunction with IgG antibody secreting cells. Anti-AChR antibody secreting cells were also found among patient with OND and in healthy controls, but at lower frequencies and numbers. These data confirm that AChR is a major target for autoimmune response in MG. 
Effects of high-dose aprotinin on blood loss, platelet function, fibrinolysis, complement, and renal function after cardiopulmonary bypass. The use of aprotinin to reduce blood loss after cardiopulmonary bypass is under debate. Concern has been raised about the renal effects of aprotinin. We administered a mean aprotinin dose of 4.2 x 10(6) kallikrein-inhibiting units to 13 patients with coronary disease undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass for 74 +/- 5 minutes (mean +/- standard error of the mean); 13 comparable patients having cardiopulmonary bypass served as control subjects, and all were studied postoperatively for 24 hours. Aprotinin reduced postoperative blood loss by 50% (p = 0.0082). Two of the 13 patients who received aprotinin needed one red cell unit each versus a total of 18 units in eight of 13 control patients (p = 0.0096). Blood pressure, hemoglobin value and serum protein concentration were higher after operation in the aprotinin group (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01). Platelet counts did not differ, but plasma thromboxane was lower in aprotinin recipients (p less than 0.001). In control patients fibrinogen degradation products (D dimer) doubled, and alpha 2-antiplasmin activity was halved during and after cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.01 to p less than 0.001), whereas aprotinin patients showed no changes. The complement breakdown products C4a, C3a, and C3dg as well as C9 neoantigen increased from prebypass baseline in both groups (p less than 0.001); the increment of C3a and C3dg was greater in the aprotinin than in the control patients (p less than 0.001). Serum electrolytes, osmolality, and creatinine remained normal in both groups of patients. Creatinine clearance was normal or above normal and virtually identical in both groups. Osmolar clearance and fractional sodium excretion were higher in the aprotinin group than in the control group shortly after cardiopulmonary bypass (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.01); renal function was unremarkable the next morning. No adverse clinical effects attributable to aprotinin were seen. In summary, aprotinin offers advantages for cardiopulmonary bypass. 
Resection of a granular cell tumor at the hepatic confluence. A precarious location for a benign tumor. Granular cell tumors are lesions that account for less than 10 per cent of benign biliary tumors and only 1 per cent occur in the biliary tract. Since the first description, 45 other cases have been described to which we add a case. In reviewing the literature, a striking predominance in black females is evident. The most frequent location of these tumors in the biliary tree appears to be the common bile duct (50%), followed by the cystic duct (37%), the hepatic ducts (15%), and the gallbladder (4%). Most patients have been treated with resection followed by restoration of biliary continuity using biliary enteric diversion. In the case presented, the tumor was located at the hepatic confluence with extension into the hepatic substance requiring segmental duct cholangiojejunostomy after resection. This resulted in fulminant sepsis and death despite adequate preoperative biliary decompression and the lack of signs or symptoms of infected bile. Alternative forms of management in the treatment of this benign condition at this location are discussed. 
Naevocytic naevi with vascular-like spaces. Fourteen cases of naevocytic naevi with anastomising lacunae suggestive of vascular spaces are reported. The cells lining these lacunae were consistent with naevus cells, being positive for vimentin and S100 protein and negative for factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus I. The cells were not surrounded by laminin or type IV collagen. We suggest the formation of these vascular-like spaces may be due to defective production or increased degradation of components of the basement membrane with a consequent lack of cohesion. 
Somatosensory evoked potentials in intracranial hypertension: analysis of the effects of hypoxia. The loss of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP's) was investigated in a feline model of intracranial hypertension. Threshold values of cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) required for maintenance of SSEP's are defined using a mathematical model. The model describes loss of amplitude of SSEP's using the form of a dose-response curve. Amplitude of the SSEP's declined to 50% of control values at a CBF of 15 ml/100 gm/min and a CPP of 20 mm Hg in the normoxic animal; in the presence of mild hypoxia (8 to 9 kPa), a significant increase in these values to 18 ml/100 gm/min and 32 mm Hg, respectively, occurred. No reliable changes in latency or central conduction time were demonstrated. It is concluded that given adequate oxygenation, evoked electrical activity is lost at too low a level of CPP for this parameter to be useful in clinical monitoring. However, even mild hypoxia, when combined with intracranial hypertension, produces a major risk to neuronal integrity. 
The effect of ethanol on the uptake, binding, and desialylation of transferrin by rat liver endothelium: implications in the pathogenesis of alcohol-associated hepatic siderosis. Chronic alcoholism has been reported to be associated with a reduced carbohydrate content of transferrin (TF), particularly, its reduced sialylation state. Low sialylation state of TF now serves as an objective marker of chronic alcohol abuse. To investigate the pathophysiological significance of this finding in relation to hepatic siderosis, also commonly associated with chronic alcoholism, the authors have investigated the effect of ethanol on the uptake, binding, and desialylation of transferrin by isolated rat liver endothelium in vitro. In pulse-chase experiments, transferrin labeled with either 125I (protein-labeled) or 3H (sialic acid-labeled) was incubated with isolated, fractionated liver endothelium with and without ethanol, and the supernates were subjected to column chromatography using RCA120- agarose. Incubation of the endothelium with increasing concentrations of ethanol resulted in a progressive increase in the desialylation rate of transferrin which was maximal when 160 mM concentration of ethanol was used. These data indicate that ethanol significantly promotes the desialylation of transferrin by rat liver endothelium. The implications of these findings in the pathogenesis of hepatic siderosis of the alcoholic are discussed. 
Causes of blindness and visual handicap in the Central African Republic. The causes of bilateral blindness (best visual acuity less than 3/60) in 1371 people in the Central African Republic seen between 1985 and 1989 who attended eye clinics in 10 out of the 16 prefectures across the country are given. The main causes of bilateral blindness were cataract (51%), glaucoma (12.7%), and onchocerciasis (8.1%). In 710 patients with unilateral blindness the main causes were cataract (38%), glaucoma (10%), iritis (7.5%), and trauma (6.3%). Bilateral blindness in children was rarely seen. The causes of visual impairment (vision between 6/18 and 3/60) in 424 patients were cataract, including aphakia (38%), maculopathy (14%), and onchocerciasis (7%). 
Endothelial cell damage by Walker carcinosarcoma cells is dependent on vitronectin receptor-mediated tumor cell adhesion. The transport of cancer cells from blood vessels to extravascular tissue is a critical step in metastasis, where endothelial cells and the vascular basement membrane act as barriers to cell traffic. Because endothelial injury can facilitate the metastasis of intravascular cancer cells in vivo, the authors have studied in vitro the free-radical-mediated endothelial damage caused by the rat Walker 256 carcinosarcoma (W256) cell after stimulation with 10(-6) mol/l (molar) phorbol ester. Here the authors have examined the hypothesis that W256 cell-mediated endothelial injury is dependent on adhesion between the effector and target cells. Attachment of phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated W256 cells to endothelial monolayers was increased 1.8 +/- 0.1-fold and damage (3H-2-deoxyglucose release from labeled endothelium) 1.4 +/- 0.1-fold after 4-hour pretreatment of the endothelium with 10 ng/ml recombinant human interleukin-1 alpha (rIL-1 alpha). Under various assay conditions, the release of 3H-2-deoxyglucose correlated directly with tumor cell adhesion (r = 0.98, P less than 0.005). In the presence of a polyclonal anti-vitronectin receptor antiserum, adhesion of stimulated W256 cells to rIL-1 alpha-treated monolayers was inhibited by 39% +/- 2%, and 3H-2-deoxyglucose release was inhibited by 53% +/- 13%. Immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence flow cytometry demonstrated that the endothelial cells but not the W256 cells expressed vitronectin receptor (VnR) on their cell surface. The surface expression of VnR by endothelial cells was increased 1.9 +/- 0.1-fold after 4 hours' incubation with rIL-1 alpha. The authors conclude that W256 cell-mediated endothelial damage is dependent on cell adhesion, which, in turn, is partly regulated by the expression of VnR on the endothelial cell surface. 
Prospective neuropathological validation of Hachinski's Ischaemic Score in dementias. The sensitivity and specificity of Hachinski's Ischaemic Score (IS) in the diagnosis of the vascular aetiology of dementia was studied in a series of 32 demented patients, dementia of the Alzheimer type (16), multi-infarct dementia (7), mixed dementia (6), Pick's disease (3), with neuropathological diagnosis as the point of reference. The IS distinguished between primary degenerative dementia and multi-infarct or mixed dementia. As single features of the IS "a positive history of stroke" and "a fluctuating course" showed differing prevalences in the latter two diagnostic categories. The IS labelled 21% of patients with primary degenerative dementia as having a vascular aetiology. The uncritical application of the IS to large samples in epidemiological studies may cause incorrect labelling of a significant proportion of patients with primary degenerative dementia as vascular dementia. These results are based on observations of long-term inpatients and depend on neuropathological criteria. While the definite diagnosis of DAT by threshold criteria concerning plaque and tangle counts is well established, neither clinical nor pathological evidence of stroke necessarily means that cerebrovascular disease has anything to do with a patient's dementia. 
Shunt failure caused by valve collapse. Shunt failure due to collapse of the Mini-Holter valve was observed 13 times in 11 out of 179 children with an implanted Mini-Holter ventriculo-peritoneal (VP) or ventriculo-atrial (VA) shunt during a 10 year period. Intussusception of the proximal or distal end of the valve thus caused a shunt failure rate of 6% of the children in this series. Two children experienced this complication twice. All collapsed valves were part of a VP shunt system. Because of this experience use of the mini valve was abandoned and an adult Holter valve was implanted in children over the age of one month. Breakdown of this particular valve has not occurred in 102 children and two hundred adults with the adult Holter shunt system. 
Adrenergic receptor responsiveness and congestive heart failure. Our knowledge and understanding of the structure, mechanism of action and regulation of receptor-adenylate cyclase systems have increased dramatically in the last few years. A family of receptors (including the beta-adrenergic receptors) and guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins (G proteins) have been purified and cloned. Structure-function studies are beginning to provide insight into how the various components of the transmembrane signaling apparatus interact to promote alterations in the activity of the effector systems. Much effort has been devoted to understanding how various pathophysiologic conditions, such as ischemia or congestive heart failure, and the therapeutic methods used to treat such conditions perturb or regulate receptor systems. It has become abundantly clear that such regulation does occur but is not restricted to simple alterations in receptor number, and may well involve covalent modification (phosphorylation) of receptors or alteration in the ability of receptors to interact with G proteins. In addition, regulation of the quantity or functionality of the various G proteins and the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase itself appear to occur. For example, recent evidence suggests that congestive heart failure in humans is associated with a decreased number of beta-adrenergic receptors as well as an increased quantity of the inhibitory G protein (Gi). These alterations may provide important insight into how to develop new therapeutic methods. Mechanisms generally responsible for transmembrane signaling, how the components are regulated by pathophysiologic conditions, and drugs used to treat disease states are discussed in detail. 
Human recombinant DNA-derived antihemophilic factor (factor VIII) in the treatment of hemophilia A. recombinant Factor VIII Study Group BACKGROUND. Current treatment of hemophilia A, a hereditary disorder affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 males, relies on plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates. We tested the safety and efficacy of a recombinant factor VIII preparation for the treatment of this disorder. METHODS. We conducted the investigation in three stages: comparing the pharmacokinetics of plasma-derived and recombinant factor VIII, assessing the efficacy of recombinant factor VIII for home therapy, and assessing its efficacy for major surgical procedures and hemorrhage. A total of 107 subjects with hemophilia, 20 of whom had not been treated previously, enrolled in the investigation. RESULTS. The in vivo recovery and elimination half-lives of recombinant factor VIII equaled or exceeded those of plasma-derived factor VIII. Seventy-six subjects participated in a home-treatment program, using recombinant factor VIII for 69 to 807 days (median, 618); home diaries of 56 subjects treated for 5 months were analyzed. Of 540 bleeding episodes, 399 (73.9 percent) required only one treatment with recombinant factor VIII. The projected annual consumption of recombinant factor VIII was similar to that of plasma-derived factor VIII concentrate. Twenty-six subjects received recombinant factor VIII for 22 surgical procedures and 10 serious hemorrhages; hemostasis was excellent in all cases. De novo formation of inhibitors occurred in only 1 of 85 previously treated subjects. Inhibitor antibodies also developed in 6 of 21 children, 20 of whom had not previously been treated; 5 had low levels (less than or equal to 7.5 Bethesda units) despite continued treatment with recombinant factor VIII. There was no evidence of new formation of antibody to foreign proteins, and recombinant factor VIII was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS. Recombinant factor VIII has biologic activity comparable to that of plasma factor VIII and is safe and efficacious for the treatment of hemophilia A. 
The time course and magnitude of spontaneous recovery of parkinsonism produced by intracarotid administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine to monkeys. We studied rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism or bilateral parkinsonism produced by unilateral or bilateral intracarotid administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Using a standardized clinical rating scale, 4 hemiparkinsonian monkeys showed a 13 to 56% (mean, 36%) spontaneous improvement during an observation period of up to 25 weeks. Generally, recovery leveled off after 14 weeks. Four bilaterally parkinsonian monkeys showed a 5 to 42% (mean, 22%) improvement over a period of up to 30 weeks. Our findings emphasize that spontaneous recovery is a potentially confounding characteristic of this monkey model when used for assessing novel antiparkinsonian therapies. 
The value of MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA-125 for discrimination between metastatic breast cancer and adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA 125 were determined in the serum of 49 patients with metastatic breast cancer and 38 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. By using the 99th percentile of the normal value distribution as the cut-off point, the positive predictive value (PV+) was found to be 85% (95% CI 76-94) for MCA, and 71% (95% CI 61-81) for CA 15-3. When receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, the PV+ for CA 15-3 was increased to 82% (95% CI 72-92), using 60 U ml-1 as the cut-off point. With the exception of two patients who had a slightly elevated MCA, MCA and CA 15-3 identified the same patients with breast cancer. By combining a positive MCA or CA 15-3 with a negative CEA and CA 125, further improvement of the PV+ could be achieved; 100% (95% CI 91-100). We conclude that MCA and CA 15-3 may play a useful role in discrimination between patients with metastatic breast cancer and those with adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. 
A comparison of the caffeine halothane muscle contracture test with the molecular genetic diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is currently diagnosed by the caffeine-halothane contracture (CHC) test. In a previous study, this test was used to establish linkage between the human gene for MH susceptibility and the ryanodine receptor (RYR) gene. The current study extends the genetic linkage analysis to a large French-Canadian kindred. In this family, genetic linkage between RYR and MH genes was not demonstrable using the currently recommended limits of normal for the CHC test in the identification of MH-susceptible individuals. With CHC test threshold limits below those currently recommended, however, complete linkage between the RYR and MH genes was seen. Comparisons of CHC test results with genetic linkage studies will increase the diagnostic accuracy of both tests as well as generate new insights into the biology of MH. 
Risk factors and the natural history of coronary heart disease in blacks. Contrary to early impressions of blacks' relative immunity to CHD, it is now clear that African Americans experience greater mortality from CHD than whites. The natural history of CHD differs between blacks and whites in three important respects: First, greater prevalence of established risk factors among blacks suggests that they may be at greater risk for heart disease than their white counterparts. Second, health care seeking differences are evident between blacks and whites, leading to lower rates of identification of early disease and slower seeking of services for acute events. However, risk factor differences and health care seeking behaviors do not appear to account for all of the differences in the natural history of heart disease between the ethnic groups, such as survival rate differences during treatment. Economic factors appear to account for only a portion of these differences in risk factors and health care seeking. Beyond differences in risk factors and health care seeking, other, as yet undetermined, factors seem to be involved. These unknown influences could include physiologic, behavioral, and/or psychologic differences. 
Total hip replacement for juvenile chronic arthritis. We review the results of 96 primary total hip replacements in 54 patients with juvenile chronic arthritis at five years or longer after surgery. The mean age at operation was 16.7 years (range 11.25 to 26.6); the follow-up period averaged 11.5 years. The clinical results in terms of pain, range of movement, mobility and function are presented. A revision procedure was required in 24 hips (25%) in 18 patients at an average of 9.5 years after the primary operation. A further 17 hips had radiographic signs of loosening. The factors thought to contribute to this relatively high failure rate in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis are discussed. 
Cough-variant asthma in children and adults: case reports and review. Two cases of cough-variant asthma are presented, one in an adult and one in a child. We discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and course of this common, yet often unrecognized entity. The keys to diagnosis are a typical history, clinical suspicion, and subsequent response to bronchodilator therapy. Treatment of cough-variant asthma is no different from that of classic asthma. 
Intentional and unintentional ureteral surgical treatment in gynecologic procedures. During a period of slightly over nine years, 4,195 extensive gynecologic procedures were performed and 40 patients required ureteral operations, with the ureteral injury unintentional in 16 patients. Extensive complications occurred in seven of 40 patients; in two of three patients in whom the injury was recognized postoperatively, nephrectomy was required. Roentgenographic imaging of the genitourinary tract prior to operation did not prevent injury nor did attempts at identification of the ureter. The majority of ureteral repairs were accomplished by ureteroneocystotomy. In selected patients, placement of percutaneous or indwelling ureteral stent prevented extensive surgical intervention. 
Localization and in vitro actions of atrial natriuretic peptide in the cat carotid body. Previous studies of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) have indicated that its release from the heart and from discrete areas of the central nervous system evokes coordinated physiological and behavioral adjustments that mitigate the adverse hypertensive effects of volume overload and/or acute increases in sodium intake. Because the reflex activity initiated by arterial chemoreceptors of the carotid body directly contributes to the integrated regulation of systemic blood pressure, we have investigated the possibility that ANP has a significant role in the chemosensory process as well. Our immunocytochemical studies show that ANP-like immunoreactivity is present in the preneural chemosensitive type I cells in the cat carotid body. Furthermore we found that the biologically active ANP fragment atriopeptin III is a potent inhibitor of carotid sinus nerve activity evoked by hypoxia. Our findings suggest that circulating and/or endogenous ANP may modulate carotid body function as part of a coordinated response to changes in systemic volume and solute balance. 
An apparent cluster of congenital hypopituitarism in central Massachusetts: magnetic resonance imaging and hormonal studies. Between 1980 and 1989, five infants (four males and one female) with congenital hypopituitarism were born within a relatively sparsely populated area of central Massachusetts, an incidence 25-fold greater than expected. In all infants the pituitary stalk was undetectable on magnetic resonance imaging, and a bright spot on T-1 weighted imaging, probably representing posterior pituitary tissue, was found ectopically located inferior to the median eminence. The height of the anterior pituitary remnant on magnetic resonance imaging varied from undetectable to 4 mm, and similarly, on hormonal testing a spectrum of deficiencies of GH, TSH, ACTH, and gonadotropin was observed. The magnitude of the hypopituitarism was less in the three patients whose anterior pituitary remnant was greater than 2 mm, and in them, TRH testing resulted in exaggerated TSH and PRL responses, suggestive of hypothalamic disease. In contrast, in the other two patients in whom the anterior pituitary remnant was less than 2 mm in height, hypopituitarism was more severe, and TRH administration resulted in little if any TSH or PRL response, characteristic of pituitary disease. The size of the anterior pituitary remnant correlated significantly with that of the ectopic posterior pituitary bright spot (P less than 0.005). We conclude that patients with congenital hypopituitarism may exhibit a spectrum of hormonal responses, varying from findings typical of hypothalamic to those characteristic of primary pituitary disease. The pattern of hormonal responsiveness is dependent on the quantity of residual anterior pituitary tissue and probably results from abnormal transport of the hypothalamic hypophyseal releasing hormones rather than to any putative hypothalamic abnormality. The significant correlation between the size and function of the anterior pituitary gland and the size of the ectopic posterior pituitary remnant suggests that the fetal pituitary gland may secrete a factor necessary for the growth and descent of the neuroepithelium to form the infundibulum and posterior pituitary gland. 
Dyslipidemic effects of cigarette smoking on beta-blocker-induced serum lipid changes in systemic hypertension. To assess the effects of beta blockers on lipids and apolipoproteins in cigarette smokers and nonsmokers, 330 patients with systemic hypertension received 1 month of placebo and 6 months of beta-blocker monotherapy. Serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A1 and B were measured. Total cholesterol increased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, 8 vs 2%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with atenolol (8 vs -3%), metoprolol (6 vs -1%) and pindolol (7 vs -6%); and decreased for both groups with celiprolol (-3 vs -10%). HDL cholesterol decreased with propranolol (smokers vs nonsmokers, -8 vs -18%), atenolol (-7 vs -2%) and metoprolol (-12 vs -1%); increased for smokers and decreased for nonsmokers with pindolol (11 vs -2%); and increased for both groups with celiprolol (5 vs 6%). Similar trends were observed with LDL cholesterol and the total/HDL cholesterol ratio. It is concluded that early noncardioselective beta blockers such as propranolol have significant dyslipidemic effects in both smokers and nonsmokers. Cardioselective drugs such as atenolol and metoprolol, or drugs with partial agonist activity such as pindolol, have variable effects. Celiprolol, a new, highly cardioselective beta 1 blocker with partial beta 2 agonist activity and vasodilatory properties, has favorable effects on lipids and minimizes the dyslipidemic effects associated with smoking. 
A combined approach for purging multidrug-resistant leukemic cell lines in bone marrow using a monoclonal antibody and chemotherapy. Selective removal of malignant cells (purging) from bone marrow (BM) is a concern in autologous BM transplantation (ABMT). Use of vincristine, etoposide, or doxorubicin for purging could be rendered ineffective by the presence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tumor cells. To circumvent this particular problem, we investigated whether 17F9, a monoclonal IgG2b antibody directed against the cell surface product of the MDR gene, P-glycoprotein, is effective in selective removal of MDR cells from BM when used with rabbit complement (C'). Using two different cell lines we have demonstrated that 17F9 + C' selectively lyses MDR-positive cells. Three rounds of antibody + C' resulted in 96.4% +/- 3.6% kill of K562/DOX and 100% +/- 0% of CEM/VLB cells. Mixtures of malignant cells and normal BM resulted in 99.85% removal of K562/DOX and 99.91% removal of CEM/VLB clonogenic cells. This treatment did not affect normal committed precursors compared with C' alone. The addition of the cytotoxic agent etoposide (VP-16) following antibody purging results in a 4.6 log reduction of malignant cells. Furthermore, this antibody was effective when used against patients' leukemic blasts. These results suggest the use of 17F9 + C' is effective and selective for removal of MDR cells from BM before ABMT and the addition of VP-16 enhances the purging efficacy. 
Mortality among petrochemical science and engineering employees. This is a study of a dynamic cohort of 13 250 commercial research and development personnel for whom information on occupational and educational background and smoking was available. Their age-, sex-, race-, and period-adjusted death rates were compared with New Jersey rates and with an internal comparison population. The overall results were favorable. The study groups had significantly fewer deaths from most major disease categories compared with other New Jersey residents. Among white male scientists and engineers, age-adjusted overall mortality and ischemic heart disease mortality were comparable to white male managers and support staff studied, whereas mortality from leukemia and lymphatic cancer was significantly elevated. Mechanics, however, had a significantly lower leukemia and lymphatic cancer mortality rate than did the comparison group. In a Poisson regression model in which white males and females from the study population were used, and for which the effects of age, smoking, college education category, period of hire, and years employed were controlled, scientists, engineers, and research technicians had elevated (nonsignificantly) mortality rates for leukemia and lymphatic cancer compared with managers and support staff. Smoking was an independent risk factor for leukemia and lymphatic cancer. Further work is needed to assess if specific environmental factors, such as benzene, other aromatics, radiation, medical treatment, and smoking habits, might have contributed to the above findings. 
Nontraumatic surgical emergencies in children. Clinical conditions that require operative intervention are frequent causes of emergency department visits. Common causes such as pyloric stenosis, intussusception, inguinal hernias, torsion of the testicle, and ingested foreign bodies are discussed, and aids in diagnosis and early intervention are addressed. Conditions that mimic surgical problems also are mentioned. 
Post-myocardial infarction mortality in patients with ventricular premature depolarizations. Canadian Amiodarone Myocardial Infarction Arrhythmia Trial Pilot Study BACKGROUND. Among survivors of acute myocardial infarction, frequent and repetitive ventricular premature depolarizations (VPDs) detected on ambulatory monitoring contribute independently to the risk of all-cause mortality and sudden death. Apart from the beta-blockers, no antiarrhythmic drug has been reliably demonstrated to reduce mortality among patients with VPDs. A pilot study was undertaken to gather data to aid in the design of a multicenter trial of amiodarone for the reduction of mortality from cardiac arrhythmias in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. Seventy-seven patients with acute myocardial infarction within the previous 6-30 days and 10 or more VPDs/hr or one or more runs of ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour electrocardiographic recording were randomized in a double-blind fashion in a 2:1 amiodarone-to-placebo ratio. The loading dose was 10 mg/kg/day for 3 weeks. The maintenance dose was 300-400 mg/day with reductions at 4-month intervals in response to VPD suppression, excessive plasma levels, or toxicity. VPD suppression at 1 week and 2 weeks was 63% and 85%, respectively, on amiodarone and 17% and 27%, respectively, on placebo. Apart from thyroid-stimulating hormone elevation and skin reactions, no side effects occurred more frequently with amiodarone. The study drug was stopped for side effects or noncompliance in 35% of amiodarone patients and 34% of placebo patients. Patients were followed for a maximum of 2 years (mean, 20 months). Arrhythmic death or resuscitated ventricular fibrillation occurred in two of 48 amiodarone patients (6%) and four of 29 placebo patients (14%), whereas the rates of all-cause mortality were five of 48 (10%) and six of 29 (21%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Amiodarone, in moderate loading and maintenance dosages with adjustments in response to plasma levels, VPD suppression, and side effects, results in effective VPD suppression and acceptable levels of toxicity. 
Prostate-type gland in the epididymis. We confirmed the presence of a prostate-type gland in the epididymis of a 30-year-old white man by immunohistochemical analysis using prostate specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase. We suggest possible histogenetic mechanisms for such previously undescribed morphological heterogeneity within this wolffian duct derivative. 
Proliferation index in various stages of breast cancer determined by Ki-67 immunostaining. To investigate factors involved in progression of breast cancer, we estimated the growth fraction of malignant cell populations in various stages of mammary cancer growth. Frozen sections were immunostained with the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody and the proliferation index determined using static image analysis. Pure intraductal carcinoma, intraductal carcinoma coexisting with invasive disease, and metastatic sites coexisting with primary tumors were studied. The proliferation index of pure intraductal carcinomas (mean 4.5%, median 1.8%) was not significantly different from invasive mammary cancers (mean 5.1%, median 2.2%). The proliferation index determined for the in situ component of primary cancers (mean 3.8%, median 1.5%) was not significantly different from values obtained from the invasive component of growth (mean 4.2%, median 2.1%). Variability between in situ and invasive components for individual cases was minimal in tumors whose proliferation index was less than 3.0%; for tumors with higher proliferation indices, the differences were greater. However, there was no trend toward a decrease or increase in growth fraction for the two components of primary tumor growth. The mean proliferative index for primary tumors (mean 4.9%, median 4.0%) was not significantly different from the mean proliferative score from a matched group of metastatic sites in the same patients (mean 5.7%, median 5.5%). Comparison of individual cases uncovered differences in some tumors; again no consistent trends in either direction were noted. An increase (or decrease) in growth activity does not accompany the transition from intraductal (in situ) disease to invasive mammary cancer, nor does a change in growth fraction necessarily accompany progression of mammary cancer from the primary to regional metastatic site. 
Thymosin treatment of chronic hepatitis B: a placebo-controlled pilot trial Chronic hepatitis B is a severe and frequently progressive disease. We assessed the safety and efficacy of thymosin fraction 5 and thymosin-alpha 1 in a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in 12 patients with chronic hepatitis B. All patients had histological and biochemical evidence of active liver disease for at least 6 mo before treatment and were positive for serum hepatitis B virus DNA and HBsAg. Seven patients received thymosin fraction 5 or thymosin-alpha 1 and five patients received placebo twice weekly for 6 mo. By the conclusion of the study (1 yr), serum aminotransferase levels had improved significantly in thymosin-treated patients, but not in the placebo group. Six (86%) of the thymosin treated patients and one (20%) patient given placebo cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum (p less than 0.04, Fisher's exact test). After treatment, replicative forms of hepatitis B virus DNA were present in the liver specimens of four of five placebo-treated patients but in only one of seven thymosin-treated patients (p less than 0.04, Fisher's exact test). Response to thymosin therapy was associated with significant improvements in peripheral blood lymphocyte and CD3 and CD4 counts and in in vitro production of interferon-gamma over initial values. No significant side effects were observed in patients given thymosin or in placebo-treated patients. Clinical, biochemical and serological improvement in patients responding to thymosin were sustained during 26 +/- 3 mo of follow-up. The results of this pilot trial suggest that thymosin therapy promotes disease remission and cessation of hepatitis B virus replication in patients with chronic viral infection. 
Instability of the cervical spine after decompression in patients who have Arnold-Chiari malformation. Stability of the cervical spine was studied in two groups of children who had myelomeningocele. Group I consisted of twenty children who had an Arnold-Chiari Type-II malformation in whom a suboccipital craniectomy (partial occipital craniectomy through the suboccipital route) and cervical laminectomy was done to decompress the brain stem. The average duration of follow-up in this group (excluding one patient) was 4.7 years (range, 2.3 to 10.4 years) after the operation. Group II consisted of twenty children who had myelomeningocele but had not had an operation for decompression. Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine in flexion and extension showed no instability between the occiput and atlas or between the atlas and axis in either group. In contrast, translation between the second and third cervical vertebrae averaged four millimeters in Group I and one millimeter in Group II (p less than 0.01), and angulation between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae averaged 17 degrees in Group I and 6 degrees in Group II (p less than 0.01). Nineteen of the twenty patients in whom a suboccipital craniectomy and cervical laminectomy (Group I) had been done had instability of the cervical spine. 
Abnormal tubular handling of sodium and water induced by atrial natriuretic peptide in essential hypertension. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) was given as an intravenous bolus injection (2.0 micrograms kg-1) to 12 essential hypertensive patients (EH) and 13 normotensive control subjects (C) in order to study the effect of ANP on renal glomerular and tubular function using the lithium clearance technique. Urinary sodium excretion (EH, + 370% vs. C, + 120%; P less than 0.001) and urine volume (EH, + 137% vs. C, + 62%; P less than 0.01) increased significantly more in EH than in controls after ANP injection. Glomerular filtration rate, renal plasma flow, and plasma concentrations of angiotensin II, aldosterone and arginine vasopressin remained almost unchanged after ANP injection, whereas the filtration fraction increased to the same extent in both groups. Both proximal (EH, - 15% vs. C, - 5%; P less than 0.01) and distal fractional reabsorption (EH, - 12% vs. C, - 5%; P less than 0.01) of sodium decreased more markedly after ANP in EH than in controls. The increase in plasma cGMP and urinary excretion of cGMP was the same in the two groups. Mean blood pressure decreased and heart rate increased to the same extent in both groups. It is concluded that the increase in urinary sodium excretion and urine volume induced by ANP bolus injection is exaggerated in EH due to a more pronounced reduction in the reabsorption of sodium and water in both the proximal and the distal tubule. 
Clinical characteristics of acromegalic patients whose pituitary tumors contain mutant Gs protein. Activating mutations in the gene for the alpha-chain of Gs, the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase, have been identified in human GH-secreting pituitary tumors. Using the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, we screened 25 GH-secreting tumors for the presence of the activating mutations. We also reviewed the clinical charts of the patients from whom the tumors were removed. Of 25 tumors, 10 (40%) contained activating mutations. Patients in the mutation-positive group came to surgery with smaller tumors and had lower GH levels. The activating mutations identify a subgroup of GH-secreting pituitary tumors that probably arise from a shared oncogenic mechanism. 
A comparison of the clinical characteristics of first and second primary head and neck cancers. A population-based study. The clinical characteristics of 183 patients with second primary neoplasms in the head and neck region were compared with those of 20,598 patients with one primary tumor in the same region registered during the period 1973 to 1984 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results Program. Second primary head and neck tumors were more likely to be diagnosed in a localized stage (47%) than if diagnosed as a single primary tumor (43%), but this difference was not significant. The tumor grade distribution was comparable in both groups. Using Cox proportional hazards modeling with age, sex, race, and stage as covariates, the median survival of patients with first and second head and neck cancer was identical (50 months). The survival of patients with localized second head and neck cancer was shorter than that of patients with single localized tumors (55 versus 102 months, P less than 0.026). Survival for regional tumors was similar (18 versus 21 months, not significant). The 84 second head and neck cancers in which the first head and neck cancer received radiation therapy (RT) had a median survival of 20 months; the 98 cases without prior RT had a median survival of 35 months. The high incidence of localized second cancers was probably due to the more intense surveillance. The worse survival in this group may be a result of prior RT or biologic characteristics of the tumor. 
Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia associated with T cell receptor delta gene rearrangement. Morphological, immunophenotypic, and genetic analyses were carried out on peripheral blood, bone marrow, and pharyngeal biopsy material from a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML). Morphological analysis of bone marrow was diagnostic of CMML; immunophenotypic analysis of peripheral blood and bone marrow were negative for B and T cell antigens, and immunochemistry performed on the pharyngeal extramedullary infiltrate showed the presence of large monocytoid cells which stained positively for muramidase. Genotypic analysis, however, showed clonal rearrangement of the T cell receptor (TCR) delta chain gene, a marker of T cell or, less commonly, B cell lymphoid neoplasms. Other TCR genes, beta and gamma, were germline in all tissues examined. TCR delta is rearranged in precursor B cell and most T lymphoid neoplasms. A small proportion of cases (10%) of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) also show rearrangement of the TCR delta gene. To date TCR delta rearrangement has not been described in CMML. The aberrant TCR delta rearrangement shown in this patient with CMML provides further evidence of the clonal nature of this disorder. 
Skeletal muscle metabolism and work capacity: a 31P-NMR study of Andean natives and lowlanders. Two metabolic features of altitude-adapted humans are the maximal O2 consumption (VO2max) paradox (higher work rates following acclimatization without increases in VO2max) and the lactate paradox (progressive reductions in muscle and blood lactate with exercise at increasing altitude). To assess underlying mechanisms, we studied six Andean Quechua Indians in La Raya, Peru (4,200 m) and at low altitude (less than 700 m) immediately upon arrival in Canada. The experimental strategy compared whole-body performance tests and single (calf) muscle work capacities in the Andeans with those in groups of sedentary, power-trained, and endurance-trained lowlanders. We used 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to monitor noninvasively changes in concentrations of phosphocreatine [( PCr]), [Pi], [ATP], [PCr]/[PCr] + creatine ([Cr]), [Pi]/[PCr] + [Cr], and pH in the gastrocnemius muscle of subjects exercising to fatigue. Our results indicate that the Andeans 1) are phenotypically unique with respect to measures of anaerobic and aerobic work capacity, 2) despite significantly lower anaerobic capacities, are capable of calf muscle work rates equal to those of highly trained power- and endurance-trained athletes, and 3) compared with endurance-trained athletes with significantly higher VO2max values and power-trained athletes with similar VO2max values, display, respectively, similar and reduced perturbation of all parameters related to the phosphorylation potential and to measurements of [Pi], [PCr], [ATP], and muscle pH derivable from nuclear magnetic resonance. Because the lactate paradox may be explained on the basis of tighter ATP demand-supplying coupling, we postulate that a similar mechanism may explain 1) the high calf muscle work capacities in the Andeans relative to measures of whole-body work capacity, 2) the VO2max paradox, and 3) anecdotal reports of exceptional work capacities in indigenous altitude natives. 
Mitogenic response of T-lymphocytes to exercise training and stress. The impact of exercise training and stress on the immune response was examined by measuring the mitogenic response of spleen lymphocytes to the T-cell mitogen concanavalin A (Con-A). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: sedentary controls (n = 11), handled controls (n = 12), treadmill runners (n = 10), and voluntary runners (n = 11) housed in running wheels. The treadmill group ran at 22 m/min (0.8 mph) for 45 min, 5 days/wk for 8 wk. After the training period, spleen lymphocytes isolated from each rat were incubated with Con-A for 54 h, pulsed with radiolabeled thymidine for 18 h, and counted for tritium activity. Counts per minute per group (means +/- SE) were as follows: sedentary, 6,839 +/- 1,461; handled, 8,959 +/- 1,576; voluntary runners, 13,126 +/- 2,069; and treadmill runners, 18,950 +/- 5,975. One-way analysis of variance and Tukey's highly significant difference test found the counts per minute of the treadmill runners to be significantly different from the counts per minute of the sedentary animals. These results indicate that the responsiveness of spleen lymphocytes to Con-A increases as the level of stress and exercise increases. 
Autonomic nervous dysfunction in essential hypertension. Borderline hypertension, a condition in which the blood pressure oscillates between normal and high values, is a predictor of future more severe hypertension. Pathophysiologically, borderline hypertension is different from established hypertension. A large proportion of such patients have elevated cardiac output and a normal vascular resistance. In established hypertension, the output is normal and resistance is elevated. The elevation of cardiac output in borderline hypertension is neurogenic; it can be abolished by an autonomic blockade of the heart. In addition to an increased cardiac sympathetic drive, increased sympathetic tone to the kidney, arterioles, and veins has also been found. In parallel with the hypersympathetic state, patients with borderline hypertension also show decreased parasympathetic tone. The enhanced sympathetic tone leads to a decreased cardiac responsiveness, and eventually, the cardiac output returns to the normal range. High blood pressure causes vascular hypertrophy, and hypertrophic vessels are hyperresponsive to vasoconstriction. These secondary changes in the responsiveness of the heart and blood vessels are the basis of transition from a high cardiac output to high-resistance hypertension. These hemodynamic changes are associated with a downregulation of the sympathetic tone. A picture of an apparently nonneurogenic high-resistance hypertension emerges. Nevertheless, when assessed in regard to the enhanced pressor responsiveness, the sympathetic drive in such patients is still excessive. Despite the apparently normal tone, the sympathetic nervous system continues to play an important pathophysiological role in established hypertension. Borderline hypertension is associated with numerous metabolic abnormalities including obesity and insulin resistance. It is tempting to view all these abnormalities as a common expression of the increased sympathetic drive in hypertension. Explanation of the basis of the association of hypertension and metabolic abnormalities promises to bring new insights into the pathophysiology of two common diseases of civilization: hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 
Pitfalls in the diagnosis of drug smuggler's abdomen. Narcotics "body packing" can be detected in abdominal X-rays by the ring shadow caused by air trapped in the packs. In a series of 82 cases admitted for abdominal X-ray in Helsinki, Finland, in 1982 through 1988, we encountered 9 (11.0%) true positives, 3 (3.6%) false positives, and 1 (1.2%) false negative. The false positives were due to the constipation often associated with the narcotics abuse. The false negative X-ray diagnosis was attributable to an inexperienced radiologist. False negatives may also be associated with packets containing marijuana, packs with few wrappings, aluminum-foil coated packs, and machine-packed narcotics. Searching for trapped air in radiographs, repeated X-raying by an experienced radiologist, use of computed tomography, or combined urinary drug screening may be applied to diminish false findings and to avoid unnecessary arrest for the purpose of fecal screening over several days. 
A single amino acid substitution in the variable region of the light chain specifically blocks immunoglobulin secretion. Although immunoglobulin light chains are usually secreted in association with heavy chains, free light chains can be secreted by lymphocytes. To identify the structural features of light chains that are essential for their secretion, we mutated a conserved sequence in the variable domain of a lambda I light chain. The effects of the mutations on secretion were assayed by transient expression in COS-1 cells. One mutant (AV60), which replaced Ala-60 with Val, was secreted as efficiently as wild-type lambda I by transfected COS-1 cells. This result was not surprising because secreted lambda II chains contain valine in this position. However, a second lambda I mutant (AV60FS62), which replaced Phe-62 with Ser as well as Ala-60 with Val, was not secreted. This mutant was arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum, as judged by immunofluorescence and by its association with a lumenal endoplasmic reticulum protein, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP). The defect in secretion was not due to gross misfolding of the lambda I chain, since cells cotransfected with AV60FS62 and an immunoglobulin heavy chain gene produced functional antigen-binding antibodies. These assembled IgM molecules were still not secreted. Hence, the replacement of Phe-62 with Ser specifically affects a determinant on the lambda I light chain that is necessary for the intracellular transport of this molecule. 
End-systolic regional wall stress-length and stress-shortening relations in an experimental model of normal, ischemic and reperfused myocardium. Assessment of left ventricular function is influenced by a number of hemodynamic factors. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the end-systolic regional wall stress-dimension relation in a series of 25 mongrel dogs. In Group A (n = 18) the regional wall stress-velocity of circumferential fiber shortening relation was measured before and after three interventions: volume infusion, metoprolol infusion and dobutamine infusion. The electrocardiogram, left ventricular pressure and its first derivative (dP/dt), arterial pressure and echocardiograms were recorded at baseline and after phenylephrine administration (to increase afterload). For each dog values for regional wall stress were plotted against the velocity of circumferential fiber shortening. For all dogs the relations were inversely linear (r = -0.65 to -0.98). Volume infusion increased end-diastolic volume (p less than 0.05) without shifting the slope or intercept of the relation, indicating its independence from preload. Dobutamine caused a shift in the intercept to the right but no change in slope and metoprolol shifted the relation to the left without altering the slope. The effect of ischemia and reperfusion on the end-systolic regional wall stress-length relation was examined in Group B (n = 7), at baseline, after 5 min of mid-left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and after 10 min of reperfusion. Afterload was increased by hydraulic aortic occlusion. Regional wall stress was lowest at baseline, highest during ischemia and intermediate after reperfusion (100.2 +/- 32.1, 193.5 +/- 81.5, 141.9 +/- 67.6 kdyn/cm2, respectively, p less than 0.001). The end-systolic regional wall stress-length relation was linear during baseline, ischemia and reperfusion (r = 0.96, 0.95, 0.98, respectively, p less than 0.05). Ischemia caused an increase in the slope and a shift in the intercept to the right compared with baseline. Reperfusion represented an incomplete return toward baseline. This study demonstrates that the regional wall stress-velocity of circumferential fiber shortening relation is linear, independent of preload, incorporates afterload and is sensitive to changes in contractility. In addition, the regional wall stress-length relation can be measured in a nonhomogeneously contracting left ventricle and is predictably altered by ischemia and reperfusion. This relation may prove useful to determine whether alterations in regional systolic function result from changes in local load or contractility in the left ventricle with a regional wall motion abnormality. 
Identification of transforming genes of subgroup A and C strains of Herpesvirus saimiri. Herpesvirus saimiri is an oncogenic herpesvirus that induces rapidly progressing lymphomas in New World primates. Using retrovirus vectors for gene transfer, specific open reading frames of H. saimiri were tested for their ability to transform rodent cells in culture. One open reading frame, designated STP-C488 (for saimiri-transformation-associated protein of the subgroup C strain 488), phenotypically transformed Rat-1 cells, resulting in formation of foci, growth at reduced serum concentration, and growth to higher cell densities. Cells transformed by STP-C488 formed invasive tumors in nude mice. The STP-A11 reading frame of strain 11 (subgroup A) was much less potent in its transforming ability than STP-C488. These results demonstrate the oncogene nature of these two open reading frames and provide a means for studying their transforming functions independent of the rest of the H. saimiri genome. 
Arthrodesis with dual plates after failed total knee arthroplasty. Eleven patients were treated by arthrodesis with dual compression plates after failed total knee arthroplasty. All patients had a solid fusion, at an average of 5.6 months after the operation. The complications included one femoral stress fracture and one persistent infection, both of which were treated successfully. Fixation with dual compression plates is a useful technique for the salvage of a failed total knee arthroplasty, even when the patient has an infection. Staggering of the plates may help to prevent late stress fractures. 
Alterations in erythrocyte rheology in patients with severe peripheral vascular disease: 1. Cell volume dependence of erythrocyte rigidity. The erythrocyte rigidity of patients suffering from severe peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was measured by a filtration method using 3 microns pore size filters. Filtration pressures for both PVD patients and normal subjects showed a cell volume dependency, and patient filtration pressures were normalized to cell volume to evaluate intrinsic, ie, nonvolume dependent, abnormalities in erythrocyte deformability. A significant (p less than 0.001) increase in cell rigidity was found in 44 of 54 PVD patients in comparison with volume-matched normal controls. No significant difference was found between patient mean corpusculer hemoglobin (MCH) and normal MCH at any given mean corpuscular volume (MCV), indicating that observed increases in erythrocyte rigidity are not attributable to changes in patient MCH. Therefore, the mechanism of increase in erythrocyte rigidity for PVD patients still needs further investigation into such parameters as levels of adenosine triphosphate,2,3-DPG, and membrane fluidity (calcium- and/or protein-binding membrane, cholesterol and phospholipid content of membrane, etc), as well as other aspects of erythrocyte physiology. 
Cerebrovascular malformation causing sudden death. Analysis of three cases and review of the literature. Three unusual cases of sudden death resulting from cerebrovascular malformation (CVM) are presented. CVMs are highly variable in location and morphology, and may be difficult to detect. Two of the patients discussed here had CVMs that involved the circle of Willis directly, and produced rapidly fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain; both of these subjects were in their late 30s. One had a history of epilepsy; the other had been completely asymptomatic prior to the catastrophic event. The third was an asymptomatic 6 year old with a cerebellar CVM, who survived long enough for inconclusive neurosurgical intervention. In all three cases, the diagnosis was not made prior to autopsy; in one case, the circumstances of death were initially misleading. The relevant literature is reviewed and discussed, with emphasis on differential diagnosis, anatomic examination, and background investigation. 
Sulfonylureas, ATP-sensitive K+ channels, and cellular K+ loss during hypoxia, ischemia, and metabolic inhibition in mammalian ventricle. Sulfonylurea derivatives glibenclamide and tolbutamide are selective blockers of ATP-sensitive K+ (KATP) channels. However, their ability to prevent cellular K+ loss and shortening of action potential duration during ischemia or hypoxia in the intact heart is modest compared with their efficacy at blocking KATP channels in excised membrane patches. In the isolated arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septum, the increase in unidirectional K+ efflux and shortening of action potential duration during substrate-free hypoxia were effectively blocked by glibenclamide, but only by very high concentrations (100 microM); during hypoxia with glucose present, glibenclamide was only partially effective at reducing K+ loss. During total global ischemia (10 minutes), up to 100 microM glibenclamide or 1 mM tolbutamide attenuated shortening of action potential duration but only reduced [K+]0 accumulation by a maximum of 32 +/- 6%. In isolated patch-clamped guinea pig ventricular myocytes in which the whole-cell ATP-sensitive K+ current was activated by exposure to the metabolic inhibitors, glibenclamide (up to 100 microM) and tolbutamide (10 mM) were only partially effective at blocking the whole-cell ATP-sensitive K+ current (maximum block, 51 +/- 10% and 50 +/- 9%, respectively), especially when ADP was included in the patch electrode solution. In inside-out membrane patches excised from these myocytes, glibenclamide blocked unitary currents through KATP channels with a Kd of 0.5 microM and a Hill coefficient of 0.5 in the absence of ADP at the cytosolic membrane surface, but block was incomplete when 100 microM ADP (+2 mM free Mg2+) was present. ADP had a similar effect on block of KATP channels by tolbutamide. These findings suggest that free cytosolic [ADP], which rises rapidly to the 100 microM range during early myocardial ischemia and hypoxia, may account for the limited efficacy of sulfonylureas at blocking ischemic and hypoxic cellular K+ loss under these conditions. 
US-guided venipuncture for venography in the edematous leg. A technique for sonographic-guided venipuncture was developed especially for venography made difficult by gross leg edema. Five patients were evaluated in whom venography had been attempted but was initially unsuccessful because of difficult venous access. All five underwent successful venipuncture after sonographic localization of a vein. Ultrasound-guided venipuncture is simple and useful when venous access by palpation is difficult. 
Stromal osseous metaplasia in carcinoma of the bladder. Osseous metaplasia of the stroma of carcinomas of the bladder is a rare finding that must be distinguished from osteosarcoma and carcinosarcoma. We report a case of multifocal osseous metaplasia in a high grade urothelial carcinoma with extensive glandular differentiation, arising in the base of the bladder of an 84-year-old man. Reports of 11 other cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in primary bladder carcinomas and of 5 cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in metastases of bladder carcinoma are reviewed. 
Effect of colloidal bismuth subcitrate on age related gastric lesions in the rat. The purpose of this study was to determine the changes in rat gastric functional morphology that take place with age and to study the action of colloidal bismuth subcitrate on the age related degeneration of the stomach. At 95 weeks of age erosions were apparent over 80% of the gastric mucosa and this was associated with a significant decline in the numbers and mucus content of the mucosal epithelial cells. The rate of stem cell proliferation in the neck region was also significantly lower than that found in 9 week old animals. The administration of 50 mg/kg colloidal bismuth subcitrate for 14 days to 9 week old animals resulted in slight hypertrophy of the mucosal epithelial cells. When 95 week animals were placed on the same regimen there was a decline in the number of deep erosions in the mucosa and an increase in the number and mucin content of the mucosal epithelial cells. A significant increase in the proliferation of the stem cell population was also observed after colloidal bismuth subcitrate administration. It is suggested that colloidal bismuth subcitrate may ameliorate the increased susceptibility to harmful agents that occurs with age. 
Hemopericardium: a late complication after repair of pectus excavatum. Hemopericardium and tamponade occurred in a 12 year old boy with Marfan's syndrome, two years after surgical repair of pectus excavatum. This life-threatening complication resulted from penetration of a fractured metal plate through the pericardium into the right atrium. The clinical details are reported and discussed. 
Sequential appearance of IL-1 and IL-6 activities in rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy. IL-1 and IL-6 activities were measured in the pleural exudate of rats during carrageenin-induced pleurisy to examine the relationship of the local production of cytokines to the inflammatory reaction. Time courses of appearance of the cytokines and inflammatory parameters in the exudate were compared. IL-1 activity and exudate volume started to increase at 1 h after the carrageenin injection, and then slightly later IL-6 activity and leukocyte number began to increase. IL-1 showed peak activity of approximately 700 U at 3 h and IL-6, of 6000 U at 5 h in the exudate, whereas exudate volume and number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes continued to increase thereafter. Furthermore, IL-6 level in the plasma of the carrageenin-injected rats showed a peak at 4 h (30 U/ml), and when rhIL-1 alpha (100,000 U) was intrapleurally injected, the more rapid increase in plasma IL-6 level was demonstrated at 1 h (30 U/ml). This latter rise was neutralized with simultaneous injection of anti-rhIL-1 alpha antibody. These facts indicate the possibility that IL-1 produced in the exudate or injected could rapidly propagate a signal to induce IL-6 production in the circulation. It took several hours to transmit an inflammatory signal that stimulated the liver to synthesize the acute-phase protein, T-kininogen. The time lag from the peak induction of IL-1 to the T-kininogen-increase in the pleurisy corresponded well to the interval for T-kininogen-increase by exogenous rhIL-1 alpha injection. These results strongly suggest that the initial inflammatory stimulus induces sequentially IL-1, IL-6, and T-kininogen production in this carrageenin inflammation. 
Cytoreductive surgery in disseminated non-seminomatous germ cell tumours of testis. Between 1977 and 1988, 67 patients underwent surgical removal of residual metastatic deposits following an aggressive chemotherapy regimen (cisplatin, vincristine, methotrexate and bleomycin alternating with etoposide, actinomycin D and cyclophosphamide) for disseminated germ cell tumours of the testis (stage IIB or above). Ninety-one surgical procedures were performed. There were 63 (69 per cent) retroperitoneal lymph node dissections, 16 (18 per cent) thoracotomies, three (3 per cent) hepatic resections, three (3 per cent) craniotomies, five (5 per cent) delayed orchidectomies and one anterolateral decompression of the vertebral column. Nine (13 per cent) patients required a repeat retroperitoneal node dissection and one patient needed a repeat thoracotomy to remove recurrent metastatic deposits during the period of follow-up. Multivisceral resections and vascular reconstruction procedures were required in 20 (30 per cent) patients undergoing retroperitoneal node dissection. Fifty-five (82 per cent) patients remain in complete remission with a mean follow-up period of 49.6 months (range 2-121 months). Nine (13 per cent) patients died with metastatic disease between 2 months to 4 years after operation. There were three deaths in the perioperative period (4 per cent). The histology of the resected metastases revealed undifferentiated active tumour in 20 (30 per cent) patients, differentiated mature teratoma in 29 (43 per cent) patients and fibrosis/necrosis in 18 (27 per cent) patients. Twelve (60 per cent) patients with undifferentiated elements and 15 patients (60 per cent) with raised preoperative tumour markers (poor prognostic categories) are in complete remission. Cytoreductive surgery in patients with metastatic germ cell tumours offers the best chance of remission following chemotherapy even in poor prognostic group categories. 
Role of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in intraabdominal abscess formation in the rat. Our concept of the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis and advanced pelvic infection, such as tuboovarian abscess, is evolving. Although Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are thought to play a significant role in acute pelvic inflammatory disease, other microorganisms, such as aerobes and anaerobes, have repeatedly been reported to play a significant role, also, particularly in the patient with advanced disease. A study was designed to evaluate the pathogenesis, and particularly any synergistic role, of some aerobes and anaerobes with N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis abscess formation. Using the rat model developed by Weinstein and Onderdonk, the study demonstrated that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis alone do not produce abscesses. However, when combined with facultative or anaerobic bacteria, synergism with abscess formation is noted frequently. The data support the hypothesis that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis initiate infection and that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria act synergistically to produce abscesses. In addition, microorganisms not inoculated were found to be recruited into the infectious process. The organisms may gain access to the peritoneal cavity via the lower genital tract or from transmucosal migration from the intestinal flora. 
Hearing improvement after acoustic tumor removal. Hearing improvement after removal of an acoustic tumor is an uncommon occurrence. Hearing improvement was observed in 8.5% of acoustic tumor removals performed using the middle fossa approach in an attempt to preserve hearing. Improvement in speech discrimination occurred most frequently and was of greatest magnitude compared with changes in the speech reception threshold or pure-tone average. No preoperative factors were predictive of postoperative hearing improvement. Findings support the conclusion that candidates for hearing preservation surgery should be chosen on the merits of their existing preoperative hearing and not on the basis of anticipated improvement. 
Cocaine-related symptoms in patients presenting to an urban emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVES: Cocaine abuse is a serious social problem that precipitates a significant number of emergency hospital encounters. To determine the nature of cocaine-related symptoms, we studied patients with cocaine use presenting to all adult services of an urban emergency department. DESIGN: Review of consecutive cases, with analysis of clinical features. SETTING: All adult EDs of an urban teaching hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Patients acknowledging recent use of cocaine (within 72 hours) and/or with cocaine detected on a toxicologic screen. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Psychiatric complaints accounted for 44 (30.6%) presentations, followed by neurologic (17.4%), cardiopulmonary (16%), trauma (11.8%), and addiction-related (11.1%) symptoms. Cardiopulmonary symptoms were more frequently associated with intranasal than with IV or smoked cocaine (P = .003). Suicidal intent was the most common psychiatric reason for presentation, occurring in 24 patients (16.6%). Seventeen presented with trauma, including three involved in motor vehicle accidents. CONCLUSION: Cardiopulmonary symptoms such as chest pain and palpitations may be significantly more frequent in patients who use intranasal cocaine; suicidal intent is common among patients presenting with psychiatric symptoms related to cocaine; and the range of cocaine-related symptoms is varied, including not only psychiatric and cardiopulmonary symptoms but also trauma. 
Hurthle cell hyperplasia and sarcoidosis of the thyroid. We report of a case of Hurthle cell hyperplasia of the thyroid that was correctly identified preoperatively by fine-needle aspiration cytology but was unexpectedly associated with sarcoid granulomas. To our knowledge, the association has not been previously reported. The rarely described thyroid involvement by sarcoidosis is briefly reviewed. 
Clinical correlates of abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension. Sixty-five patients with esophageal complaints were studied to determine clinical associations with abnormal sensitivity to intraesophageal balloon distension (esophageal sensory dysfunction). Associations were examined in four categories: motility, esophageal symptoms, recent psychological symptoms, and general clinical features. A positive response to balloon distension (pain with less than or equal to 8 ml volume) was found in 29 (45%) of the subjects. This response was associated with specific findings in each category except recent psychological symptoms. A multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that an increased frequency of multipeaked waves on motility testing, presence of dysphagia, and shorter height of the subject each had an independent association with positive response to balloon distension (P less than or equal to 0.05 for each). Further comparison of subjects with sensory dysfunction, motor dysfunction, or both (sensorimotor dysfunction) indicated that subjects with the combined disorder appeared more symptomatic than those with either finding alone. These observations indicate that: (1) esophageal motor and sensory dysfunction are partially associated, but both contribute to the symptomatic state; (2) dysphagia may be representative of sensory dysfunction in some cases; and (3) subject height should be taken into consideration when interpreting balloon distension results. 
Management of the pregnant woman with spinal cord injuries. This paper forms part of an ongoing prospective study of pregnancy and labour in women with spinal cord injuries and combines a prospective and retrospective analysis of 17 pregnancies in 15 women with spinal injuries. The management and outcome in those 17 pregnancies is reviewed. 
Nutritional therapy for infants with diarrhea. The appropriate choice of treatment for infants with diarrhea has long provoked debate. Growth of infants with diarrhea is adversely affected by associated diseases including anorexia, malabsorption, catabolic response to infection, and iatrogenic starvation. To prevent the negative effects of diarrhea on the nutrition of infants, continued feeding during the active and early convalescent phases has been recommended. Although this concept is not new, until recently it has been little used in the treatment of diarrhea. In this article we examine the current knowledge about, and trends in, feeding infants with diarrhea. We will discuss treatments for the well-nourished infant with acute diarrhea, the infant with prolonged diarrhea, and the malnourished infant. Information regarding the use of local staples will also be provided. 
A double-blind, placebo-controlled cytogenetic study of oral acyclovir in patients with recurrent genital herpes. The antiherpes drug acyclovir breaks chromosomes in vitro at millimolar concentrations and at highly toxic doses in rodents but does not induce single-gene mutations. Recurrent genital herpes patients were examined to determine if such chromosomal damage occurs in peripheral lymphocytes during acute or chronic acyclovir therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to receive acyclovir suppressively and for recurrences, placebo suppressively and acyclovir for recurrences, or placebo suppressively and for recurrences (n greater than or equal to 20 for each group; all treatment double-blind). Normal volunteers and acyclovir-treated cultures served as additional controls. Cytogenetic analyses were done at enrollment (pretreatment), on day 5 of acute acyclovir or placebo treatment for the first postenrollment recurrence (postacute), and at the end of a year on study (postchronic). Cells in metaphase, 150 for each patient, were examined at each time point for structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. No cytogenetic effects of chronic or acute oral acyclovir treatment were found relative to lifestyle controls, pretreatment controls, or placebo treatment. 
Lysis of autologous melanoma cells by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes: association with clinical response. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) can be grown in vitro in medium containing interleukin-2 (IL-2). In clinical trials at the Surgery Branch of the National Cancer Institute, patients with metastatic malignant melanomas were treated with IL-2 plus the adoptive transfer of autologous TILs. At the time of treatment, TILs were assayed for in vitro lysis of fresh autologous and allogeneic melanoma cells and Daudi cells. Patients were evaluated for clinical response 4-8 weeks later. Lysis of autologous tumor cells by TILs was significantly higher for responding than for nonresponding patients. Tumor cells from responding and nonresponding patients were equally sensitive to lysis by allogeneic lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. There was no difference between TILs from responding and nonresponding patients for lysis of LAK-sensitive Daudi cells, which was low in most cases and demonstrated that TIL lysis of autologous tumor cells was not due to LAK cells. The observed association of autologous tumor cell lysis by TILs with clinical response suggests that the development of culture methods to optimize lysis of autologous tumors may lead to increased response rates using this TIL treatment regimen. 
Gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging of the musculoskeletal system. Contrast-enhanced MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine has been used in the evaluation of musculoskeletal disorders only in recent years, and for the most part it is still under investigation. Review of the literature identified potential uses for this technique: (1) in the spine, for differentiation between scar tissue and recurrent disk herniation and for evaluation of epidural tumors; (2) in musculoskeletal tumors, for differentiation between tumor necrosis and peritumoral edema and for characterization and evaluation of tumors before and after treatment; (3) in the joints for delineation of cartilage and tendon tears, with intraarticular injection, and for differentiation between pannus and joint effusion, with IV injection; and (4) for delineation of infectious processes. Further studies are needed to confirm most of these potential indications. It is unlikely that gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging will become a routine part of musculoskeletal MR imaging, and its use will be reserved for specific circumstances. 
Granular cell tumor of the eyelid. We present a case of granular cell tumor of the eyelid. Although commonly reported elsewhere in the body, this entity rarely occurs in the ocular adnexa. 
Major role for arterial disease in morbidity and mortality after kidney transplantation in diabetic recipients. OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical characteristics of diabetic end-stage renal disease patients that place individual transplant candidates at high risk for arterial morbidity and mortality after transplantation. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied the course of 101 sequential renal allograft recipients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, transplanted between 10 November 1980 and 1 April 1986. Arterial disorders were tabulated from medical records and interviews with individual patients, their families, and their private physicians. Documentation of discrete arterial events included recorded physical examinations, radiographic studies, laboratory data, electrocardiograms, peripheral vascular flow studies, and operative reports. The prevalence of preoperative arterial disease was compared with the occurrence of new arterial events after kidney transplantation. RESULTS: Within a mean follow-up period of 47 mo, a 30% absolute mortality rate was observed. Of these deaths, 57% resulted from arterial disorders. Clinical manifestations of arterial disease were recognized in 41% of recipients before transplantation, and 78% of these patients suffered new vascular events after transplantation. Of the entire sample, 57% developed at least one new complication of arterial disease after transplantation, whereas only 34% had no vascular diagnosis before or after transplantation. Cerebral, coronary, and peripheral arterial complications after transplantation occurred in 14, 28, and 36% of the patients, respectively. The corresponding incidences of stroke, myocardial infarction, and amputation were 12, 14, and 25%. Pretransplant coronary artery disease predisposed to new coronary events after transplantation, but only peripheral arterial complications occurred more often after transplantation compared with the preoperative period. The probability of arterial complications or death correlated with patient age at first transplant and duration of diabetes but not with sex or smoking history. CONCLUSIONS: Intrinsic arterial disease in diabetic renal allograft recipients contributes heavily to the long-term morbidity and mortality after transplantation and poses the major threat to survival. Diabetic transplant candidates greater than 35 yr of age or with clinical evidence of arterial disease should undergo an extensive vascular assessment, including stress thallium myocardial imaging and/or coronary arteriography. Such recipients should receive careful preoperative counseling about their excess risk for subsequent arterial disorders. 
Epidural analgesia in Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome. Effects on respiratory function. The anaesthetic management of a patient with Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome undergoing thoracotomy is described. Epidural anaesthesia, in combination with a light level of general anaesthesia, provided good operating conditions and postoperative analgesia. Pulmonary function and ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide and hypoxia were measured before operation. These tests were repeated after the epidural administration of 8 ml 2% lignocaine before surgery and after 2 mg morphine sulphate in 10 ml saline postoperatively. Minor reductions in some of the ventilatory parameters were observed. The epidural technique appears to be a useful and safe method by which to manage patients with Eaton-Lambert syndrome undergoing thoracotomy. 
1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptors and human colon adenocarcinoma. Epidemiological evidence suggests that dietary calcium and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) might have a protective effect against colorectal cancers. Since the presence of receptors is required for steroid action, specific 1,25-(OH)2D3 receptors (RD3) were investigated in biopsies taken at different levels of the colon. The study involved 90 biopsies from patients operated on for colorectal adenocarcinoma. They were paired biopsies from adenocarcinoma tissue and adjacent normal mucosa. In addition, 26 normal intestinal mucosa biopsies from patients without cancer were examined. RD3 receptors were assayed in tissue extract by the dextran-coated charcoal technique and also characterized by sucrose density gradient sedimentation. Scatchard analysis showed a single class of specific high affinity-low capacity sites binding for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The incidence of RD3 was 86 per cent in normal mucosa (n = 77) and lower in carcinoma (n = 34), for which the incidence decreased significantly (P less than 0.001) from right colon (58 per cent) to left colon (37 per cent) and rectum (19 per cent). These data suggest that the normal colon is a potential target organ for 1,25-(OH)2D3 which might modulate calcium transport in the colon. Loss of receptivity to 1,25-(OH)2D3 is associated with malignant transformation. 
Complications of the Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion: case report of late development of malignancy. We report on 3 patients with bladder exstrophy followed for more than 15 years after having undergone Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion. One patient had adenocarcinoma at the ureterocolonic anastomoses 16 years after diversion. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a malignancy developing after a Heitz-Boyer procedure. The other 2 patients had significant problems with urinary incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections. Initial success with this form of urinary diversion can be followed by significant long-term complications. 
Abnormalities of the breast caused by biopsy: spectrum of mammographic findings. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with the spectrum of mammographic abnormalities caused by postbiopsy changes in the breast. Although many breast biopsies leave no residual abnormality, occasionally an atypical manifestation of a biopsy scar may produce a radiologic finding suspicious enough to mandate a biopsy. Problem-solving maneuvers recommended to increase confidence that a change is related to a recent biopsy include (1) skin markers; (2) comparison with preoperative films; (3) correlation with physical examination; (4) tailored mammographic views, including focal spot compression, magnification, and tangential views; and (5) postoperative and follow-up mammograms. 
Intracisternal recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fifteen patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture were administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) directly into the basal subarachnoid cisterns after minimal surgical clot removal and aneurysm clipping. Preoperatively, 13 patients had diffuse or localized thick subarachnoid blood clots on computerized tomography (CT), and two had diffuse thin clots. The rt-PA was given as a single intraoperative injection of 7.5 mg (one patient), 10 mg (nine patients), or 15 mg (five patients). Postoperative cisternal drainage was employed in three patients. All patients except one demonstrated partial to complete cisternal clot clearance on CT scans within 24 hours after surgery. The patient who showed no clot reduction was the only patient in this series to develop symptomatic vasospasm and was the only fatality, dying 8 days after rupture. No vasospasm was seen on follow-up cerebral angiography in six of the 14 responding patients, and mild-to-moderate arterial narrowing was seen in at least one major cerebral artery in the remaining eight patients. Severe angiographic vasospasm was not seen, although the patient who died did not undergo repeat angiography. There was one major complication early in the series which seemed clearly related to treatment, and that was a large extradural hematoma occurring within several hours of craniotomy. Intrathecal fibrinolytic treatment appears effective in clearing subarachnoid clot and reducing vasospasm, and may be associated with acceptable risks if given to patients with large-volume subarachnoid hemorrhages at high risk for severe vasospasm. 
Nerve palsy associated with total hip replacement. Risk factors and prognosis. We reviewed the results of 3126 consecutive total hip replacements and identified postoperative neuropathy in the ipsilateral lower extremity after fifty-three (1.7 per cent) over-all and after 1.3 per cent of the primary arthroplasties. The prevalence was 5.2 per cent after the primary arthroplasties that had been done for congenital dislocation or dysplasia of the hip and 3.2 per cent after the revisions (all diagnoses). Thus, these two types of operations were risk factors (p less than 0.01). Limb-lengthening only partially accounted for the increased prevalence of neuropathy after these procedures. The sciatic nerve was involved in all but five extremities. The cause of the palsy was unclear or unknown in thirty (57 per cent) of the extremities. When the patients were last seen, at a minimum of one year and a maximum of sixteen and one-half years after the operation, seven extremities were normal neurologically, thirty-three had a mild neurological deficit, and thirteen had a major deficit. All patients who had complete recovery of neurological function had it by twenty-one months. Of thirty-six extremities that were evaluated at a minimum of twenty-four months after the operation, seven were neurologically normal, twenty-three had a mild persistent deficit, and six had a major persistent deficit. The ability to walk decreased for all patients who had a nerve palsy. The greatest disability was in the patients who had been forty-eight years old or less and had had a primary total hip replacement (p = 0.037). The prognosis for neurological recovery was related to the degree to which the nerve was damaged. 
Trisomy 21: association between reduced recombination and nondisjunction. To assess the association between recombination and nondisjunction of chromosome 21, we analyzed cytogenetic and DNA markers in 104 trisomy 21 individuals and their parents. Our DNA marker studies of parental origin were informative in 100 cases, with the overwhelming majority (94) being maternal in origin. This value is significantly higher than the 75%-80% maternal nondisjunction rate typically observed in cytogenetic studies of trisomy 21 and illustrates the increased accuracy of the molecular approach. Using the maternally derived cases and probing at 19 polymorphic sites on chromosome 21, we created a genetic map that spans most of the long arm of chromosome 21. The map was significantly shorter than the normal female linkage map, indicating that absence of pairing and/or recombination contributes to nondisjunction in a substantial proportion of cases of trisomy 21. 
Detection of inadvertent respiratory placement of small-bore feeding tubes: a report of 10 cases. Documented inadvertent respiratory placement of small-bore feeding tubes was identified in 10 patients over a 2-year period in five intensive care units and two general wards. Types and effectiveness of bedside methods used by clinicians to test tube position were described. The most frequently used methods were observation for respiratory distress and auscultation of the abdomen during air insufflations through the tubes. It was concluded that commonly used bedside methods to test feeding tube placement often gave false reassurance that the tubes were properly positioned. 
Differences in beta-adrenergic neuroeffector mechanisms in ischemic versus idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND. We measured the content and activities of components of the beta-adrenergic receptor-G protein-adenylate cyclase complex and adrenergic neurotransmitter levels in left and right ventricular myocardial preparations derived from 77 end-stage failing human hearts from patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) or ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (ISCDC). METHODS AND RESULTS. The results were compared with data obtained in 21 nonfailing hearts removed from organ donors. Compared with ISCDC ventricles, IDC left and right ventricles exhibited a greater degree of total beta- or beta 1-receptor downregulation. In contrast, compared with IDC right ventricles, isolated tissue preparations of ISCDC right ventricles exhibited a greater degree of subsensitivity to the inotropic effect of isoproterenol, indicating a relatively greater degree of functional uncoupling of right ventricular ISCDC beta-receptors from mechanical response. In addition, relative to IDC left ventricles, preparations of ISCDC left ventricle exhibited greater subsensitivity to beta-agonist-mediated adenylate cyclase stimulation, indicating functional uncoupling of left ventricular ISCDC beta-receptors from cyclic AMP generation. The uncoupling of beta-receptors in ISCDC left and right ventricles may have been a result of abnormalities in G protein activation of adenylate cyclase; compared with age- and cardiac function-matched respective left or right IDC ventricles, ISCDC left ventricles exhibited less stimulation of adenylate cyclase by NaF or forskolin but no change in Mn2+ stimulation, whereas ISCDC right ventricles exhibited less stimulation by the nonhydrolyzable guanine nucleotide Gpp (NH)p. Also, IDC right ventricles exhibited a "selective" (not present in IDC left ventricles or ISCDC ventricles) decrease in stimulation of adenylate cyclase by Mn2+. Tissue neurotransmitter levels and pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation were altered to similar extents in IDC and ISCDC. CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that potentially important differences exist in the regulatory behavior of components of the beta-adrenergic receptor-G protein-adenylate cyclase complex in IDC versus ISCDC, differences that presumably relate to the distinct pathophysiologies of these two types of heart muscle disease. 
Home use of rectal diazepam for cluster and prolonged seizures: efficacy, adverse reactions, quality of life, and cost analysis. From 1982 through 1987, 128 families, who were instructed in the use of rectally administered diazepam (R-DZP) for the treatment of severe epileptic seizures, were surveyed. Sixty-seven families returned questionnaires and met inclusion/exclusion criteria; the results were used to analyze the medical, psychosocial, and economic impact of this program during the first year following instruction. Twenty-six families did not use R-DZP, primarily because of patient improvement. Among families using R-DZP, a total of 428 doses were administered to 41 children. R-DZP was effective in controlling seizures in 85% of patients. Adverse reactions usually were mild, consisting of drowsiness and/or behavioral changes. Compared to the year prior to instruction, emergency room visits decreased in both R-DZP-treated and -nontreated children; however, cost-savings were greater for the R-DZP group ($1,039.00 vs $420.00 per patient per year). Improvements in quality of life associated with the availability of R-DZP were observed by 58% of users and 27% of nonusers which included improved management of their children's seizures, increased flexibility in family activities, and greater peace of mind. R-DZP appears to be a practical method in the effective treatment of severe seizures at home. 
Central role of sodium in hypertension in diabetic subjects. The common association between diabetes mellitus and hypertension may be promoted by several mechanisms. Patients with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes and prone to develop nephropathy often have a familial predisposition for essential hypertension, whereas normotensive healthy offspring of nondiabetic essential hypertensive parents tend to have a reduced insulin sensitivity and increased plasma insulin levels. Na+ retention occurs as a characteristic alteration in type I or non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes; exchangeable body Na+ (Naex) is increased by 10% on average. This abnormality develops in the uncomplicated stage of diabetes and differentiates diabetic from nondiabetic essential hypertensive subjects. Possible Na(+)- retaining mechanisms include increased glomerular filtration of glucose leading to enhanced proximal tubular Na(+)-glucose cotransport, hyperinsulinemia (which activates several tubular Na+ transporters), an extravascular shift of fluid with Na+, and, once it occurs, renal failure. The pathogenetic role of Na+ retention in diabetes-associated hypertension is supported by positive correlations between systolic or mean blood pressure and Naex and by normalization of blood pressure after removal of excess Na+ by diuretic treatment in hypertensive diabetic subjects. The latter may also have an enhanced sensitivity of blood pressure to Na+. Plasma levels of active renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, and catecholamines are usually normal or low in metabolically stable type I or type II diabetes. However, an exaggerated vascular reactivity to norepinephrine and angiotensin II commonly occurs already at uncomplicated stages of type I or type II diabetes. This may be a manifestation of functional (i.e., intracellular electrolytes) and/or morphological (proliferation, narrowing, and stiffening) vasculopathy. Diabetes-associated Na+ retention, vasculopathy, and a presumably inherited predisposition for both diabetes and essential hypertension may represent important complementary factors favoring the frequent occurrence of hypertension in the diabetic population. 
Detection of malignant bone tumors: MR imaging vs scintigraphy. One hundred six patients with a known or suspected diagnosis of bone cancer (11 patients with biopsy-proved primary tumors, 95 patients with metastatic disease) were evaluated with scintigraphy and MR imaging to determine the relative sensitivity of each technique in the detection of bone disease. MR imaging was performed at 0.5 T as part of the entry evaluation into Intramural Research Board protocols (30%), for evaluation of cord compression, or because of an equivocal scintigram. MR was performed with T1-weighted (e.g., 300-500/10-20 [TR/TE]), T2-weighted (e.g., 2000/80) spin-echo (SE), and a short-TI inversion recovery (STIR) pulse sequence. Scintigrams were performed with 99mTc-methylene diphosphonate. A retrospective analysis showed that in 30 (28%) of 106 patients, MR imaging performed over a limited region of interest revealed a focal abnormality consistent with tumor that was not observed on scintigraphy. Only one patient had an abnormality on scintigraphy, caused by a metastasis, that was not found on MR images. In 73 (69%) of the 106 patients, the results of MR imaging and scintigraphy were equivalent; in 41 cases results of both techniques were normal. A McNemar analysis of the discordant cases showed MR imaging to be more sensitive than scintigraphy was (p less than .001). Our results suggest that although MR imaging has a greater sensitivity in detecting focal disease, scintigraphy is still the most useful screening test for evaluating the entire skeleton. MR imaging should be reserved for clarification of scintigraphic findings when suspicion is high for tumor. 
Central hypothyroidism due to isolated TRH deficiency in a depressive man. A depressive man was evaluated for developing chronic fatigue and cold intolerance, in whom laboratory findings showed decreased thyroid hormone levels (T4, 2.7 micrograms dl-1; T3, 0.76 ng ml-1) with normal blood levels of TSH. A single bolus injection of TRH (500 micrograms) significantly stimulated prolactin secretion, but did not cause an increase in blood TSH levels (basal level, 1.2 microU ml-1 vs. 1.3 microU ml-1 30 min after injection). By contrast, TRH-induced TSH stimulation occurred after repeated injection of TRH for 4 consecutive days (basal level, 1.5 microU ml-1 vs. 5.6 microU ml-1 30 min after injection). Blood thyroid hormone concentrations were restored to normal levels after long-term administration of TRH. Other pituitary functions remained unchanged. A diagnosis of central hypothyroidism due to isolated TRH deficiency was made in this case, and the data presented here indicate that partial resistance of pituitary thyrotrophs to TRH may be associated with depression. 
Postoperative primary adrenal failure in a patient with anticardiolipin antibodies A 50-year-old woman with no history of thrombosis or recurrent abortions developed pulmonary thromboembolism and bilateral hemorrhagic adrenal infarction with adrenal failure after hysterectomy for uterine fibroids. Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) were detected in high titer and have persisted. She remains well, without further thromboses, taking steroid replacement and warfarin anticoagulation. The initial presentation of aCL related disease can be as thrombotic postoperative complications in middle-age. 
Differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia with tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid). BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia have a characteristic (15;17) translocation, with a breakpoint on chromosome 17 in the region of the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha). Since this receptor has been shown to be involved with growth and differentiation of myeloid cells in vitro, and since recent clinical studies have reported that tretinoin (all-trans-retinoic acid) induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia we studied the effects of tretinoin on cellular maturation and molecular abnormalities in patients undergoing the induction of remission with this agent. RESULTS. Eleven patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia were treated with tretinoin administered orally at a dose of 45 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day. Nine of the 11 patients entered complete remission. In two patients, complete remission was preceded by striking leukocytosis that then resolved despite continued drug treatment. Serial studies of cellular morphologic features, cell-surface immunophenotypic analysis, and fluorescence in situ hybridization with a chromosome 17 probe revealed that clinical response was associated with maturation of the leukemic clone. All patients who responded to treatment who were tested by Northern blot analysis had expression of aberrant RAR-alpha. As patients entered complete remission, the expression of the abnormal RAR-alpha message decreased markedly; however, it was still detectable in several patients after complete morphologic and cytogenetic remission had been achieved. CONCLUSIONS. Tretinoin is a safe and highly effective agent for inducing complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia. Clinical response to this agent is associated with leukemic-cell differentiation and is linked to the expression of an aberrant RAR-alpha nuclear receptor. Molecular detection of the aberrant receptor may serve as a useful marker for residual leukemia in patients with this disease. 
Esophageal motility disorders and chest pain. Motility abnormalities have long been recognized as a possible esophageal cause of chest pain; however, their exact role and prevalence remain largely unknown. Baseline manometry and the various provocative tests may suggest an esophageal origin, but their yield is low. The recent advent of prolonged ambulatory monitoring of intraesophageal pressure and the assessment of psychological factors are contributing to a clearer understanding of this complex problem. 
Spinal cord schistosomiasis: a pediatric case mimicking intrinsic cord neoplasm. We present the clinical, myelographic, MRI, and histologic data on a 7-year-old girl with confirmed Schistosoma mansoni infection of the spinal cord. MRI of the granulomatous spinal lesion revealed extensive enlargement of the cord in the T11-12 area, with some intramedullary swelling extending to T-5 through T-7. The clinical manifestations of spinal schistosomiasis can be diverse, and there should be a high index of suspicion for all patients from endemic areas. 
Resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder. A preliminary report of reconstruction with a new modular spacer. Reconstruction after resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder is difficult. Twelve patients had reconstruction using a new titanium modular spacer. This modular system allows the surgeon to reconstruct variable lengths of the proximal humerus. Although the patient has no active shoulder motion, excellent hand and elbow function is preserved. The spacer serves as a temporary device in the young active patient. A more definitive reconstructive procedure can be performed after the completion of chemotherapy and a sufficient disease-free interval. 
Congenital optic tract syndrome. We describe two patients with complete homonymous hemianopia who were unaware of their visual field defects. The clinical impression of an optic tract syndrome was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, which showed absence of the corresponding tract in each case. The pathogenesis of congenital absence of the optic tract is unclear but it could represent either a primary failure of development or secondary atrophy due to focal injury during the perinatal period. 
CT evaluation of solitary pulmonary nodules: value of 185-H reference phantom. The pulmonary nodule CT reference phantom is widely used in the evaluation of nodules 2 cm or less in diameter. It is used to detect benign patterns of calcification that are not visible on thin-section CT scans. Since 1986, the reference nodules have been manufactured with a nominal composition of 185 H. The multicenter study published in 1986 used nodules with a nominal composition of 264 H, 100 H more than the threshold value reported by Siegelman et al. in 1980. In the multicenter study, one of 37 nodules diagnosed as benign with the phantom proved to be malignant. The purpose of this study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate with the 185-H phantom and to ascertain whether the malignant tumors predicted to be benign actually contained calcification. We retrospectively reviewed 296 cases in which examinations had been performed with the 185-H nodules since 1986. Eighty-five nodules were diagnosed as benign by comparison to the reference phantom. These 85 contained no visible calcification on thin-section CT scans. Ten of the 85 cases were shown to be malignant tumors. Eight were diagnosed as having a high probability of benignity. Two were diagnosed as having a moderate probability of benignity. Calcium was present in the tissue of all six nodules available for review. Fifty-nine of the 85 nodules were still clinically indeterminate at the time of this review. Even if all of the clinically indeterminate nodules are benign, the misdiagnosis rate would be significantly higher than in most previous studies. Although analysis by using the reference phantom with 185-H nodules may indicate a high probability of benignity, close radiologic follow-up is necessary. 
Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment of chronic pain: a follow-up study of treated and non-treated groups. There are relatively few outcome studies of multidisciplinary chronic pain programs which have utilized no-treatment comparison groups. The present study compared a group of chronic pain patients (N = 42) treated in a comprehensive multidisciplinary pain program with a group of patients (N = 15) who were evaluated but not treated. Comparisons were made at evaluation and at a follow-up period averaging 11 months later. From evaluation to discharge, the treated group showed significant increases in physical functioning. From evaluation to long-term follow-up, both the treated and non-treated groups showed significant decreases in self-report pain ratings and interference with activities ratings. However, only the treated group showed a significant decrease in addictive medication use and increase in work functioning. The return-to-work rate for the treated group was 48% with an additional 28% of the patients being returned to vocational rehabilitation. None of the non-treated group returned to work or vocational rehabilitation. Results are discussed in terms of their support for the conclusion that comprehensive multidisciplinary pain programs produce marked subjective and functional changes. 
Neural processing of craniovascular pain: a synthesis of the central structures involved in migraine. In order to determine the anatomical distribution of cells concerned with relaying craniovascular nociception, local cerebral glucose utilization was determined by the 2-deoxyglucose method in tissue autoradiographs of the alpha-chloralose anesthetized cat. The superior sagittal sinus was carefully lifted from the brain by sectioning the dura laterally and the falx inferiorly and suspending the sinus across two platinum hook electrodes for stimulation. The sinus was stimulated electrically and its effect on caudal brainstem, upper cervical spinal cord and diencephalic metabolic activity determined. Stimulation of the sinus caused increased metabolic activity in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, in the cervical dorsal horn and in a discrete area in the dorsolateral spinal cord at the second cervical segment. Metabolic activity was also increased in the ventrobasal thalamus, specifically in the ventroposteromedial (188%) nuclear group, in the medial nucleus of the posterior complex (70%) and the intralaminar complex (49%). There was no change in the surrounding thalamus, lateral geniculate nucleus or overlying cerebral cortex. These increases in 2-deoxyglucose utilisation were blocked by bilateral trigeminal ganglion ablation. The dorsolateral area activated in the spinal cord corresponds to a hitherto unrecognised group of cells in or near the lateral cervical nucleus that may form an important relay for craniovascular nociception. Further electrophysiological studies with glass coated tungsten microelectrodes have characterised the cells in these regions of the thalamus to be responsible for relaying nociceptive information. An understanding of the connections and properties of the neurons that subserve craniovascular pain is an essential prerequisite to understanding the complex pathophysiology of migraine. 
Dissecting aneurysm of the posterior cerebral artery: spontaneous resolution. Dissecting aneurysms of the intracranial arteries display vascular pathological features that appear sporadically, generally affecting young adults. The clinical features of this condition may involve both ischemic episodes and hemorrhages. Posterior circulation is affected less than the rest of the intracranial arteries, and it is extremely rare to find the posterior cerebral arteries only affected. Mortality is high in patients where the lesion is located in the posterior intracranial circulation, although dissecting aneurysms limited to the posterior cerebral arteries may, to a certain extent, be benign. We report the case of a young woman with ischemia in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery that occurred subsequent to a dissecting aneurysm that resolved spontaneously to a complete remission, both clinically and as demonstrated by angiography. A review of the literature is made, analyzing the pathogenic, clinical, angiographic, and therapeutic characteristics of such lesions. 
Ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus after aorto-iliac reconstruction. Between January 1, 1980, and June 30, 1989, 9 patients (6 males and 3 females) developed ischemic injury to the spinal cord or lumbosacral plexus following 3,320 operations on the abdominal aorta (0.3%). The incidence of this complication was 0.1% (2 of 1,901) after elective and 1.4% (3 of 210) after emergency abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, and 0.3% (4 of 1,209) after repair for occlusive disease. Three of the latter had prior clinical evidence of distal embolization. Eight grafts were bifurcated (aorto-iliac:four, aorto-femoral: three, aorto-ilio-femoral:one). One patient underwent extra-anatomic revascularization. Only two patients had supraceliac aortic cross-clamping and one patient underwent exclusion of both internal iliac arteries. Four patients had hypotension. Early mortality was 22% (two of nine). Severe perioperative complications, mostly due to associated visceral and somatic ischemia and sepsis, were present in seven of the nine patients. The extent and type of the neurologic injury correlated with long-term outcome. Patients with ischemic injury of the lumbosacral roots or plexus had better recovery. Attention to the pelvic circulation and the collateral blood supply is important. Use of gentle technique to prevent embolization, avoidance of hypotension and prolonged supraceliac cross-clamping, revascularization of at least one internal iliac artery, and the use of heparin may decrease but not eliminate paraplegia. Once this unexpected complication occurs, careful neurologic evaluation should be done to localize the lesion and aid prognosis. 
Lipid peroxidation: a possible factor in late graft failure of coronary artery bypass grafts. Atherosclerosis is the paramount cause of late vein graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting. Lipid peroxidation, which may play a significant role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, was examined in segments of vein grafts (n = 6) harvested at reoperation for coronary disease. These were analyzed for cholesterol, phospholipid, triglyceride, and lipid peroxides. Nonatherosclerotic vascular tissues, including coronary arteries (n = 6), saphenous veins (n = 9), and donor aortic specimens (n = 11) were analyzed for comparison. Risk factors for atherosclerosis including elevated serum cholesterol and triglycerides, smoking, and hypertension were more frequent in patients with coronary artery disease compared to organ donors. Lipid peroxides were elevated in explanted vein grafts when compared to either saphenous vein, coronary artery or donor aorta. Lipid peroxides were not significantly different in saphenous vein when compared to coronary artery, but levels in both of these tissues were greater than in donor aorta. Although increased levels of lipid peroxides in explanted veins may simply reflect morphologic changes in these grafts, the known effects of lipid peroxides on a number of biochemical events suggest that they may contribute directly to graft failure after coronary artery bypass grafting. 
Brain and brain tumor uptake of L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine: competition with natural L-amino acids SPECT studies with L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine (IMT) were carried out in 10 patients with different types of brain tumors--first under fasting conditions (basal) and a week later during intravenous infusion of a mixture of naturally-occurring L-amino acids (AA load). An uptake index (UI) was calculated by dividing tissue count rates by the integral of plasma count rates. The UI decreased by 45.6% +/- 15.4% (n = 10, p less than 0.001) for normal brain and by 53.2% +/- 14.1% for gliomas (n = 5, p less than 0.01) during AA load compared to basal conditions, while two meningiomas and a metastasis showed only a minor decrease (23.9 +/- 5.7%, n.s.). Two pituitary adenomas could not be delineated on the SPECT scans. These data indicate that IMT competes with naturally-occurring L-amino acids for transport into normal brain and gliomas. Transport characteristics of IMT into tumors of nonglial origin appear to be different from those of gliomas. For both types of tumors, it is advisable to perform IMT-SPECT under fasting conditions. 
The use of angioplasty, bypass surgery, and amputation in the management of peripheral vascular disease BACKGROUND. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has been adopted widely as a treatment for patients with peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities. However, the effect of this procedure on the overall management of peripheral vascular disease and on the outcomes of patients has not been clearly delineated. In particular, it is not known whether angioplasty has replaced other treatments for peripheral vascular disease. METHODS. To assess the extent to which angioplasty is used and the associated changes in the surgical management of peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities, we used data on hospital discharges in Maryland to identify all angioplasty procedures, peripheral bypass operations, and lower-extremity amputations performed for peripheral vascular disease in Maryland hospitals between 1979 and 1989. RESULTS. We estimated that from 1979 to 1989 the annual rate of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities, adjusted for age and sex, rose from 1 to 24 per 100,000 Maryland residents (P less than 0.0001 by linear regression). Despite this increase in the use of angioplasty, the adjusted annual rate of peripheral bypass surgery also rose substantially, from 32 to 65 per 100,000 (P less than 0.001), whereas the adjusted annual rate of lower-extremity amputation remained stable at about 30 per 100,000. Total charges for hospitalizations during which a peripheral revascularization procedure was performed increased from $14.7 million in 1979 (in 1989 dollars) to $30.5 million in 1989. CONCLUSIONS. In Maryland, the adoption of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities has been associated with an increase in the use of peripheral bypass surgery and with no decline in lower-extremity amputations. These results could be due to increased diagnosis of peripheral vascular disease, expanded indications for procedural interventions, or an increased number of repeat procedures performed in patients with peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremities. 
Transethmoid decompression of the optic nerve in head injuries: an update. Sixty-three patients with loss of vision following head injury were subjected to decompression of the optic nerve by the transethmoid route. This paper discusses the criteria for selection of patients for surgery, the results of the operation and the prognostic factors determining the results. 
Local hormonal factors (intracrine, autocrine, and paracrine) in hypertension. Vasoactive hormones acting as endocrine, neuroendocrine, or local hormonal systems (intracrine, autocrine, and paracrine) are an important component of the many factors that regulate blood pressure. Hypertension may be the result of an alteration in the balance between vasodepressor and vasopressor hormonal systems. Changes in this balance could be due to genetic factors such as mutations in one of the genes of the vasoactive system or environmental factors that alter the synthesis and release of one or more vasoactive hormones. Endocrine and neuroendocrine vasopressor hormonal systems, such as the renin-angiotensin system and catecholamines, play a well-established and important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of some secondary forms of hypertension. The blockade of such systems has already resulted in effective antihypertensive treatment. The role of local hormonal systems is less well established; however, recent evidence suggests they also play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension. Some vasopressor hormonal systems, such as the renin-angiotensin system, can act as both endocrine or local hormonal systems. Work using transgenic rats harboring the mouse Ren-2 gene has conclusively demonstrated that the renin-angiotensin system, acting as a local hormonal system, has the capability to cause severe hypertension. Whether this model of experimental hypertension mimics any type of human hypertension is not known. Vasodepressor hormones such as kinins, prostaglandins, and endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) act mainly as local hormonal systems, with the notable exception of atrial natriuretic factor, which may act as both an endocrine and a local hormone. The tissue kallikrein-kinin system, acting either directly or via paracrine eicosanoids or EDRF, participates in local regulation of the circulation, renal function, and the acute antihypertensive effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. A restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) that distinguishes the kallikrein gene family of a strain of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) from normotensive Brown Norway rats has been identified. In a set of 32 recombinant inbred strains derived from these SHR and Brown Norway strains, the RFLP marking the kallikrein gene family of SHR cosegregated with an increase in blood pressure. Also, in a study of Utah families it was found that a dominant-allele kallikrein gene expressed as high urinary kallikrein excretion was associated with a decreased risk of essential hypertension. In conclusion, vasopressor and vasodepressor hormones, acting not only as endocrine but also as local hormones, play an important role in the regulation of blood pressure and the pathogenesis of hypertension.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Contribution of endogenous endothelin to the extension of myocardial infarct size in rats. Pathophysiological roles of endogenous endothelin have been studied from the viewpoint of its contribution to the extension of myocardial infarct size. A monoclonal antibody against endothelin 1 (AwETN40) suppressed changes induced by endothelin 1 and endothelin 2 but did not modify those by endothelin 3 in vivo or in vitro. Effects of AwETN40 on myocardial infarct size were investigated. Coronary ligation (1 hour) and reperfusion (24 hours) in rats caused infarction in 35% of the left ventricle. Repetitive or single administration of AwETN40 reduced the infarct size; an intravenous injection of 22.5 mg/kg of the antibody 5 minutes after coronary occlusion or 5 minutes before reperfusion reduced the size by 38% or 31% of the control, respectively. Plasma and tissue endothelin 1 and plasma big endothelin 1 in rats were measured at various stages after occlusion. Plasma endothelin 1 showed a fourfold increase 10 minutes after reperfusion (from 1.02 to 3.96 pg/ml) and had returned to the control value after 8 hours. Plasma big endothelin 1 showed changes similar to those of plasma endothelin 1. No significant changes in plasma endothelin 2 and endothelin 3 were observed. Cardiac tissue contained seven times as much endothelin 1 as the control value 1 hour after reperfusion (4.59 versus 33.1 pg/g tissue), and a high concentration (13.2 pg/g tissue) was maintained even after 48 hours. We concluded that an increase in endogenous endothelin 1 plays an important role in the extension of myocardial infarct size. 
Prospective, randomized controlled trial of interferon-alpha in children with chronic hepatitis B. Thirty-six children with chronic hepatitis B were entered into a randomized controlled trial of recombinant human interferon-alpha. All patients had hepatitis B virus DNA and increased levels of aminotransferases in serum for at least 1 yr. Twelve children received 10 MU of interferon-alpha 2b/m2 body surface area three times a week (group I); 12 children received 5 MU/m2 under the same conditions (group II); and 12 children served as controls (group III). During 6 mo of therapy, 12 of 24 (50%) treated patients (7 from group I, 58%, and 5 from group II, 42%) and 2 of 12 (17%) controls lost hepatitis B virus DNA from serum and subsequently remained negative. Comparison of the rate of response in group I vs. controls showed a statistically significant difference (p less than 0.05). Eleven of 12 (92%) treated patients who cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum lost HBeAg, seroconverted to anti-HBe and had improvement in liver histological findings with loss of hepatitis B virus DNA from liver. In 10, serum ALT levels became normal. Interferon-alpha was well tolerated and all children finished therapy. These findings indicate that a 6-mo course of interferon-alpha is effective in inducing a serological, biochemical and histological remission of disease in approximately 50% of children with chronic hepatitis B. 
Diagnostic utility of ventilation/perfusion lung scans in acute pulmonary embolism is not diminished by pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of prior cardiac or pulmonary disease upon the utility of ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans in the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Ventilation/perfusion scans were evaluated among 365 patients with no prior cardiac or pulmonary disease and compared to V/Q scans in 526 patients with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease. Among patients with no prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, PE was present in 117 and PE was excluded in 248. Among patients with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, PE was present in 140 and excluded in 386. The positive predictive value for PE of high probability V/Q scans among patients with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 55 of 66 (83 percent), was not significantly lower than among patients without prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 50 of 54 (93 percent) (NS). The positive predictive value of low probability V/Q scans was similar with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 25 of 182 (14 percent), and without prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, 17 of 113 (15 percent) (NS), as was the predictive value of near normal/normal V/Q scans, 2 of 51 (4 percent), vs 3 of 79 (4 percent) (NS). The sensitivity of high probability V/Q scans, with pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease and without, 55 of 140 (39 percent) vs 50 of 117 (43 percent), did not differ significantly. The specificity of high probability V/Q scans with prior cardiac or pulmonary disease and without, 375 of 386 (97 percent) vs 244 of 248 (98 percent) was also similar (NS). In conclusion, the diagnostic utility of V/Q scans for acute PE was not impaired by the presence of pre-existing cardiac or pulmonary disease. Fewer patients, however, with no prior cardiac or pulmonary disease, had intermediate (indeterminate) V/Q scans. 
Decision for surgical management of perforation following endoscopic sphincterotomy. Duodenal perforation resulting from endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is a serious complication with a high mortality. Diagnosis is often problematic and the optimum treatment is controversial. Eight proven perforations occurred following 441 ES at University of Colorado Hospital, a rate of 1.8 per cent. Physical and laboratory findings were of little diagnostic value, whereas plain abdominal radiographs showed evidence of perforation in 86 per cent. All patients were operated on promptly after diagnosis of perforation. Delay in diagnosis of perforation beyond 24 hours in six patients was associated with a high morbidity and two deaths. Analysis of published series confirmed that delay in diagnosis and delay in operation after perforation were associated with a higher mortality rate than early diagnosis with or without operation. We recommend operative intervention in all patients with clinical evidence of perforation following ES. 
Effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage and a thromboxane A2 synthetase inhibitor on intracranial prostaglandins. The effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on intracranial prostaglandins (PGs) were studied in canines. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was produced by the "two hemorrhage" method. Basilar artery caliber and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the occipital cortex were reduced by 42% and 43% during delayed vasospasm, respectively. Once delayed vasospasm had developed, intravenous infusion of OKY-046, a selective inhibitor of thromboxane (TX) A2 synthetase, induced no significant change in angiographic vasospasm but caused a significant increase in rCBF. In delayed vasospasm, cortical levels of PGF2 alpha were significantly decreased, whereas plasma levels of PGF2 alpha and TXB2 in the transverse sinus were significantly increased. The intravenous infusion of OKY-046 in delayed vasospasm induced a significant increase in cortical PGF2 alpha and PGE in the occipital cortex, and caused a significant increase in plasma 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and a significant decrease in plasma TXB2 in the transverse sinus. In delayed vasospasm, decreased cortical levels of PGF2 alpha may reflect a decrease in rCBF and increased plasma PGF2 alpha and TXB2 levels may reflect enhancement of intravascular coagulation. These PGs have very strong and various biological activities. The results suggest that SAH induces complicated changes of intracranial PGs and OKY-046 can improve these pathological changes. 
Reduction of myocardial infarct size by poloxamer 188 and mannitol in a canine model. Poloxamer 188 has been reported to inhibit thrombosis, decrease whole blood viscosity, and improve perfusion of damaged tissue. Mannitol has free radical scavenging capabilities that might contribute to myocardial salvage after ischemia. Because these agents appear to work in different ways, we studied their cardioprotective properties when they were used separately and in combination. After 75 minutes of left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion, dogs received poloxamer 188 (48 mg/kg), mannitol (0.5 gm/kg), or both intravenously during an additional 15 minutes of LAD occlusion and for 45 minutes of reperfusion, whereas control dogs received an equal volume of saline solution. After surgery the animals were maintained for 24 hours and then killed. Areas of myocardial infarction (MI) and risk of infarction (R) were calculated by means of planimetric analysis of slices of myocardium stained with 1.5% triphenyltetrazolium and 0.5% Evans blue dye. The ratio of MI/R (mean +/- standard error of the mean) were: control, 25.6 +/- 1.8% (n = 10); poloxamer 188, 12.7 +/- 2.0% (n = 10); mannitol, 10.6 +/- 2.5% (n = 11); and poloxamer 188 plus mannitol, 8.0 +/- 4.1% (n = 10). Measurement of microvascular blood flow indicated a similar 86% to 91% reduction of blood flow to the area at risk in all treatment groups. Consequently both poloxamer 188 and mannitol appear to increase salvage of ischemic myocardium and a combination of the two may be more effective than either agent alone. 
A unified model of atrioventricular nodal conduction predicts dynamic changes in Wenckebach periodicity. The atrioventricular (AV) node responds in a complex fashion to changes in activation rate. A variety of approaches have been used to explain these dynamic AV nodal responses, but none has been able to account fully for AV nodal behavior. Three specific rate-dependent properties of the AV node have been described: 1) time-dependent recovery after excitation, 2) an effect of short cycles to advance recovery ("facilitation"), and 3) a gradual slowing of conduction in response to sustained, high-frequency activation ("fatigue"). We hypothesized that a model incorporating quantitative descriptors of all three processes might be able to account for a wide variety of AV nodal behaviors. Quantitative descriptors of AV nodal recovery, facilitation, and fatigue were developed based on AV nodal conduction changes during selective pacing protocols in seven autonomically blocked dogs. These descriptors were incorporated into a set of mathematical equations that define AV nodal conduction of any beat based on activation history. The equations were then applied to predict pacing-induced Wenckebach periodicity in each dog. Experimental data were obtained after nine to 19 step decreases in atrial cycle length into the Wenckebach zone in each animal. Observed behaviors included complex patterns of block, a progressive increase in the level of block over 5 minutes of rapid pacing, and periods of alternating patterns of block. The model accurately predicted the onset of AV block at each cycle length, the relation between conduction ratio and cycle length as a function of time, and the changing patterns of Wenckebach periodicity during sustained atrial pacing. All three terms of the model equation (describing recovery, facilitation, and fatigue) were essential to account fully for the observed behaviors. Elimination of AV nodal fatigue from the model resulted in failure to account for time-dependent changes in Wenckebach patterns, whereas exclusion of facilitation led to consistent overestimation of the degree of AV block at each cycle length. We conclude that a mathematical model incorporating terms to describe recovery, facilitation, and fatigue accurately predicts a wide range of Wenckebach-type behavior and that complex conduction patterns of the AV node can be fully accounted for by simple functional AV nodal properties. 
Characterization of childhood acute leukemia with multiple myeloid and lymphoid markers at diagnosis and at relapse. To define the clinical and biologic significance of childhood acute mixed-lineage leukemia diagnosed by stringent criteria, we studied 25 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressing greater than or equal to 2 myeloid-associated antigens (My+ ALL), and 16 cases of acute myeloid leukemia expressing greater than or equal to 2 lymphoid associated antigens (Ly+ AML). These cases represented 6.1% of 410 newly diagnosed ALLs (two treatment protocols) and 16.8% of 95 AMLs (two protocols). T-lineage--associated antigens were identified in 9 of the My+ ALL cases and in 14 of those classified as Ly+ AML; all but 1 of the 19 cases that could be subclassified had an early thymocyte stage of differentiation. The My+ ALL cases had an increased frequency of French-American-British (FAB) L2 morphology (36%); the Ly+ AML cases were characterized by FAB M1 or M2 morphology, low levels of myeloperoxidase reactivity and combined populations of myeloperoxidase-positive large blasts and small blasts generally of hand-mirror morphology. Karyotypic abnormalities included t(9;22)(q34;q11) in three cases of My+ ALL, 11q23 translocations in two cases of My+ ALL, and 14q32 translocations in three My+ ALL and five Ly+ AML cases. Mixed-lineage expression lacked prognostic significance in either ALL or AML; however, the findings indicate that some patients with Ly+ AML may respond to prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase after failing on protocols for myeloid leukemia. At relapse, two My+ ALLs had converted to AML and two Ly+ AMLs to ALL; one case in each group showed complete replacement of the original karyotype. Acute mixed-lineage leukemia does not adequately describe the heterogeneity of the cases identified in this study and should be replaced by a set of more restrictive terms that indicate the unique biologic features of these leukemias. 
Effects of the nonpeptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 on blood pressure and renal functions in spontaneously hypertensive PH dogs. A colony of genetic hypertensive dogs with systolic blood pressure of 140 to 220 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure greater than 100 mm Hg in the trained state was used. The objective of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic and renal effects of the novel angiotensin II receptor antagonist DuP 753 given intravenously to these dogs. Renal functions and blood pressure were measured 45 to 75 min after the intravenous administration of DuP 753 at 1, 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg and were compared to control (placebo) treatment. Arterial pressure was slightly but significantly and dose-dependently reduced by DuP 753. Glomerular filtration rate increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, effective renal plasma flow was dose-dependently increased. Filtration fraction was unchanged. Renal vascular resistance was significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg of DuP 753. DuP 753 increased fractional sodium excretion at all doses and increased fractional potassium excretion only at the highest doses. The vasopressor effects of angiotensin I and II were dose-dependently inhibited by DuP 753. These data show that DuP 753 has beneficial renal hemodynamic effects and lowers arterial pressure in this canine model of essential hypertension. 
Muscle sympathetic nerve activity in renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) is increased in patients with essential hypertension compared with normotensive subjects. However, the features of sympathetic nerve activity are still unknown in secondary hypertension. We examined MSNA in eight patients with renovascular hypertension and in 11 patients with primary aldosteronism. Twenty patients with essential hypertension and 20 normotensive subjects who were age-matched to the patients with renovascular hypertension and those with primary aldosteronism were also studied. The MSNA of a bundle of the tibial nerve was recorded by microneurography in supine subjects and expressed as both burst rate (bursts/min) and burst incidence (bursts/100 heart beats). Plasma renin activity and the plasma concentration of angiotensin II and aldosterone were also measured. MSNA was increased in the patients with renovascular hypertension compared with the patients with primary aldosteronism and those with essential hypertension and the normotensive subjects (p less than 0.01 for each). MSNA was decreased in the patients with primary aldosteronism compared with those with essential hypertension (p less than 0.01), and it was smaller than in the normotensive subjects (p less than 0.1). Furthermore, MSNA, plasma renin activity, and the plasma concentration of angiotensin II decreased significantly in five patients with renovascular hypertension 4-10 days after successful percutaneous renal angioplasty. Thus, the changes in MSNA seem to characterize the pathophysiology of renovascular hypertension and primary aldosteronism. Activation of the renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the increase in the central outflow of sympathetic nerve activity, thus exacerbating hypertension in patients with renovascular hypertension. 
The growth hormone, prolactin and TSH response to TRH and L-dopa in patients with hyperprolactinaemia and a normal-sized sella turcica may denote a pituitary adenoma. Forty-one patients with hyperprolactinaemia and suspected prolactinomas were studied. Growth hormone (GH) and thyrotropin (TSH) secretory patterns after thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH) were affected in the majority of patients. The disturbances were observed regardless of tumour size as indicated by the radiological sella size. In patients with hyperprolactinaemia and normal-sized sella turcica, an abnormal GH and TSH response to TRH can be helpful in the diagnosis of a microadenoma. The hyperprolactinaemia per se and its effect on dopaminergic hypothalamic neurones may be the cause of the GH and TSH response. By contrast, many patients with macroprolactinomas showed insufficient GH secretory capacity. 
Progressive congestive heart failure. Ways to approach office management. Treatment of congestive heart failure depends on the cause, precipitating factors, and symptoms of the disease in each patient. Dr Kahn outlines the use of the three main types of pharmacologic agents given for heart failure--diuretics, vasodilators, and digoxin. He describes a stepwise regimen, whereby agents are added as needed to improve symptoms and prolong life. 
Increased plasma apolipoprotein(a) levels in IDDM patients with microalbuminuria. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) have a significantly increased risk of macrovascular disease, particularly if they have persistent proteinuria. To determine whether altered levels of apolipoprotein(a) [apo(a)], the plasminogenlike glycoprotein of the potentially atherogenic lipoprotein(a); contribute to the increased risk of atherosclerosis, apo(a) levels were measured in 107 patients with IDDM and compared with nondiabetic control subjects and male elective coronary artery graft patients. Apo(a) levels were increased in diabetic patients with microalbuminuria (geometric mean 245 U/L, 95% confidence interval [CI] 142-427, n = 30) and albuminuria (mean 196 U/L, 95% CI 97-397, n = 18) with levels comparable to patients with coronary artery disease (mean 193 U/L, 95% CI 126-298, n = 40), which were higher than in the control group (mean 107 U/L, 95% CI 85-134, n = 140; P = 0.016). Apo(a) levels in diabetic patients without microalbuminuria (mean 86 U/L, 95% CI 63-116, n = 59) were comparable with the control population and less than in those with microalbuminuria (P less than 0.001) and albuminuria (P = 0.014). The elevated apo(a) levels found in patients with IDDM and increased urinary albumin loss may contribute to their heightened risk of macrovascular disease. 
Deglycosylation of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor is impaired in the faeces of patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease). 1. alpha 1-Proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-antitrypsin) was excreted in the faeces of patients with inflammatory bowel disease in different molecular forms: Mr-51,000 and Mr-45,000 forms were widely found in the stools of patients with active disease, whereas a Mr-38,000 species was frequently recovered from healthy subjects and patients with quiescent disease (Mizon, Becuwe, Balduyck et al. Clin. Chem. 1988; 34, 2268-70). 2. N-Terminal sequencing of the Mr-38,000 form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor, after SDS/PAGE and electrotransfer on polyvinyl difluoride membranes, showed that it differed from plasma alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor by the loss of 17 N-terminal amino acids. 3. Carbohydrate analysis of the isolated Mr-38,000 form revealed a total lack of neutral sugars. 4. In contrast, the Mr-51,000 form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor is glycosylated and thus could be differentiated by virtue of its reactivity with concanavalin A. The analysis of 25 faecal extracts from patients with Crohn's disease allowed us to confirm that the presence of the glycosylated form of alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor was closely related to the degree of inflammation. 5. From these data, it may be hypothesized that the hydrolytic activity of some glycosidases is greatly reduced in active Crohn's disease. 
Pattern of treatment failure following laser for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: implications for follow-up protocol. In an effort to devise a rational protocol for the follow-up of patients who have had destructive treatment for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), an analysis has been performed of treatment failures following laser therapy in 2130 women treated between 1980-1989. Of this group, 1253 women have been followed up for 3 years or more and 380 for 6 years or more. There have been 119 treatment failures (5.6%), of which 71% of the women had the second lesion detected during the first year of follow-up, 24% during the second year, 3.3% during the third year, and 1.7% during the sixth year. In 18% of these 119, the second lesion was detected colposcopically in the presence of negative cytology. There were two cases of microinvasion and one frankly invasive lesion following laser, all diagnosed during the second year of follow-up. Our data suggest that if the first year of follow-up includes at least one colposcopic examination, some second lesions will be diagnosed in the presence of negative cytology. 
The potential utility of a rapid CK-MB assay in evaluating emergency department patients with possible myocardial infarction. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of a new rapid creatine kinase-MB (R-CK-MB) assay compared with a standard CK-MB (S-CK-MB) assay and to determine its potential use in the evaluation of emergency department patients with possible myocardial infarction. DESIGN: Retrospective patient identification with subsequent testing of excess sera for CK-MB and total CK using an identity-unlinked procedure. SETTING: Large, urban, teaching hospital ED. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients with excess sera and one of several defined presentations chosen to identify those with possible myocardial ischemia or infarction. Patients with clearly documented noncardiac etiologies of their symptoms or signs were excluded. MAIN RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 271 patient specimens for the R-CK-MB assay compared with the S-CK-MB assay were 100%, 96.8%, 75.0%, and 100%, respectively. The R-CK-MB assay was positive for 32 patients (11.8%). Of these, eight (25.0%) were admitted to unmonitored beds, and five (15.6%) were discharged home. All of these 13 patients had initial ECGs without evidence of ischemia or infarction. On follow-up, at least eight of the 13 had evidence of infarction. CONCLUSION: The R-CK-MB assay demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity compared with the S-CK-MB assay. When used for patients in whom a cardiac care unit admission is not considered, the rapid assay may identify some patients with unsuspected myocardial infarction and prevent inadvertent discharge or admission to unmonitored beds. 
Placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial of growth hormone treatment in prepubertal children with chronic renal failure. Stunted growth is a serious problem for children with chronic renal failure (CRF) despite normal endogenous growth hormone secretion and normal or elevated plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factors (IGF) I and II. Biosynthetic growth hormone (GH) was given to 20 prepubertal children (eleven boys, nine girls; mean age 9.5 years, range 4-16) with CRF and severe growth retardation in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trial. 6 months of subcutaneous injection of GH (4 IU/m2 per day) was either preceded or followed by 6 months of placebo injection. The patients had a full examination every 3 months. Sixteen children completed the study. Height velocity improved significantly with GH therapy (p less than 0.0001) and placebo (p less than 0.04), but the GH-induced height-velocity increase exceeded that of placebo by 2.9 cm per 6 months. There was a positive relationship between prestudy height velocity and height-velocity increase. Bone maturation was not affected. GH caused a significant increase in IGF-I and a moderate increase in IGF-II plasma concentrations. The pretreatment elevation of IGF-binding protein-1 decreased by almost 50% during GH therapy, while IGF-binding protein-3 increased significantly in concentration, although this increase was significantly smaller than the GH-induced increase in IGF-I. Fructosamine, lipid, and parathyroid concentrations remained constant. Renal function deterioration did not accelerate. Impressive height-velocity increase can be achieved with GH therapy in children with CRF and growth retardation without changes in renal function. Bone maturation appears unaffected suggesting improved final height. Treatment is best started before growth retardation becomes considerable. 
Intracranial extension of a naso-ethmoid schwannoma. A rare case of intracranial extension of a naso-ethmoid schwannoma is presented. Its subsequent removal with few sequelae confirmed the benign nature and good prognosis of the disease. 
Alpha-blocker therapy of hypertension. An unfulfilled promise. For various reasons, the alpha 1-receptor blocker prazosin has been used infrequently as initial therapy for hypertension. The introduction of additional agents of this class with properties different from prazosin provides slower onset of action, which should reduce the degree of first-dose and postural hypotension and a longer duration of action, which allows for once-a-day dosage. A summary of the published data on efficacy, side effects, and special properties of this class of agents indicates that they will probably be used more extensively, particularly because of their ability to improve lipid and glucose-insulin metabolism. 
Postmortem studies of the heart in three fatal cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hearts of individuals who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan, with particular attention paid to the coronary arteries, the neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart because of reported terminal disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management. 
Neurokinin and NMDA antagonists (but not a kainic acid antagonist) are antinociceptive in the mouse formalin model. While much evidence implicates substance P (SP), an endogenous neurokinin (NK), as a primary sensory transmitter of acute pain in mammalian spinal cord, its role in continuous (tonic) pain is less clear. Although glutamate is co-localized with SP in dorsal root ganglion neurons, its role in nociceptive processing is uncertain. While antagonists of NKs and excitatory amino acids (EAAs) have been found to be antinociceptive in some acute assays, they have not been tested against tonic pain. We hypothesize that: (1) NKs and EAAs contribute to signaling of tonic chemogenic nociception; and (2) interaction between NK and EAA systems is important in determining the perceived intensity of a continuous noxious stimulus. We therefore evaluated two NK antagonists ([D-Pro2,D-Trp7,9] SP (DPDT-SP, 0.26-6.6 nmoles, non-specific) and [D-Pro4, D-Trp7,9,10,Phe11]-SP(4-11) (DPDTP-octa, 1.6-12.3 nmoles, somewhat NK-1 selective], as well as DL-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (DL-AP5, NMDA antagonist, 0.05-1 nmole) and urethane (a kainic acid (KA) antagonist at 2.5 mumoles) for antinociceptive activity in the mouse formalin model. Administered intrathecally (i.t.), DL-AP5 and both NK antagonists were significantly antinociceptive while urethane (2.5 mumoles) and naloxone (2.7 nmoles) were inactive. A50 values for mean % analgesia, nmoles/mouse i.t. (95% CLs) were: DPDT-SP, 1.1 (0.79-1.6); DPDTP-octa, 3.9 (2.4-6.1); DL-AP5, 0.29 (0.16-0.71). The antinociception associated with 1.3 nmoles of DPDT-SP was not reversed by co-administering 2.7 nmoles of naloxone. Co-administration of 0.1 nmoles of DL-AP5 with either 1.3 nmoles of DPDT-SP or 3.3 nmoles of DPDTP-octa did not lead to additive antinociception. 
Cost-effectiveness of prophylaxis in total hip replacement. A theoretical analysis was performed regarding the cost-effectiveness in terms of lives saved (reduction of fatal pulmonary embolism [PE]) and in terms of money (dollars spent for prevention and treatment) of seven strategies in the management of venous thromboembolic disease in patients over 39 years of age undergoing elective total hip replacement (THR). Strikingly, this theoretical analysis suggests that low-dose warfarin combined with clinical surveillance of deep vein thrombosis would reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 20 per 1,000 patients to 4 per 1,000 patients and simultaneously reduce the charges for venous thromboembolic disease from $550,000 to about $400,000 per 1,000 patients. Based on this analysis, we strongly recommend this measure on a routine basis. Adding venography or duplex sonography routinely to this prophylactic regimen would, in this theoretical analysis, reduce the incidence of fatal PE from 4 per 1,000 patients to 0.15 per 1,000, but adds charges of $200,000 per extra life saved in the case of routine venography and $50,000 in the case of routine sonography. Low-dose warfarin prophylaxis combined with routine sonography does not generate more charges than no prophylaxis with no screening while drastically reducing the incidence of fatal PE from 20 to 0.3 per 1,000 patients. Where duplex sonography is not easily available, a 12-week postoperative course of low-dose warfarin for every patient with no routine screening will be efficacious in reducing fatal PE and as cost-effective. 
Cell-mediated immunologic responses and recurrent genital herpes in the guinea pig. Effects of glycoprotein immunotherapy. The specific immune alterations associated with HSV recurrences are ill defined although it appears that alterations in cell-mediated immune mechanisms are more likely associated with recurrent disease than humoral immunity. Immunization with HSV glycoproteins B and D (gBgD) after primary HSV infection has reportedly reduced the frequency of recurrences but the mechanisms remain unidentified. We therefore evaluated the effects of immunization with cloned gBgD on selected cell-mediated immune responses and their relationship to recurrent disease by using the guinea pig model of genital HSV-2 infection. In two experiments, immunization with gBgD + CFA on days 21 and 42 after HSV-2 inoculation significantly decreased the number of subsequent recurrent lesion days observed whereas CFA alone had no effect. Immunization with gBgD + CFA increased the lymphoproliferative and in vitro IL-2 response to gBgD more than to whole HSV-2 Ag preparations. Peak responses were observed 2 wk after the second immunization. The HSV-specific cytolytic response was also persistently increased beginning 1 wk after the first immunization. Analysis including both untreated and gBgD-immunized animals revealed that recurrent lesion days were inversely correlated to the IL-2 response to whole HSV-2 Ag (p less than 0.0001), the IL-2 response to gBgD (p = 0.0004), and the HSV-specific cytolytic response (p = 0.005 and 0.003 in two experiments, respectively). When the untreated group was analyzed separately, only the IL-2 response to whole HSV-2 Ag correlated to recurrences (p = 0.007). HSV glycoprotein immunization may increase IL-2 or other cytokines secreted by HSV-sensitized T cells increasing critical immune responses, such as NK- or lymphokine-activated killer-mediated cytolysis, that could eliminate the reactivated virus before the development of clinically apparent lesions. 
Memory and pain: tests of mood congruity and state dependent learning in experimentally induced and clinical pain. The associative network theory of memory [2] is outlined along with the concepts of mood congruity and state dependent learning. Two experiments are reported which investigate the occurrence of these effects where memory for pain is concerned. In experiment 1 the performance of 25 chronic pain patients was compared with that of 25 non-patient controls on a test involving both immediate and delayed recall of a mixed list of stimulus words of 3 types: pain-related, negative or neutral. No significant group differences were found in overall rates of immediate recall. As predicted, however, pain patients recalled more pain-related words than non-patient controls (P less than 0.001). On delayed recall the same significant group x word-type interaction was obtained (P less than 0.02), but in addition the non-patient controls recalled significantly more words overall (P less than 0.02). These results provide some evidence for the occurrence of a mood congruity effect. Experiment 2 investigated state dependent learning and mood congruity effects in experimentally induced pain. Twenty volunteer subjects were allocated to 1 of 4 conditions in which a wordlist (as in experiment 1) was presented following either a painful stimulus (cold pressor test) or a non-painful one (warm water) and was then recalled immediately following further exposure to stimulus conditions which were congruent with the original stimulus (warm/warm and cold/cold conditions) or non-congruent (warm/cold and cold/warm conditions). A 3-way split plot ANOVA yielded no significant main effects for group or word-type, but a significant interaction emerged between state at encoding and at recall (P less than 0.04). 
Chronic subcorneal pustulosis with vasculitis: a variant of generalized pustular psoriasis in black South Africans. A rare, but distinctive chronic eruption in six female black South Africans is reported. The original diagnosis of subcorneal pustular dermatosis of Sneddon and Wilkinson in these patients was refuted by the subsequent histological observation of both spongiform pustules and an underlying vasculitis. This may represent a previously undocumented form of generalized pustular psoriasis. 
Piezogenic wrist papules: a common and asymptomatic finding. The first description of piezogenic wrist papules is presented. Twenty-nine persons were examined; 76% had pedal papules and 86% had wrist papules. Piezogenic papules are a common, nonhereditary finding and are not secondary to an inherent connective tissue defect. 
Review of neurobehavioral assessment tools. Behavioral, cognitive, and memory deficits are frequently observed sequelae of brain injury. Yet in most critical care settings, neurologic assessment is limited to evaluation of arousal, pupillary response, orientation, and motor capability. Behavior, cognition, and memory are not routinely evaluated. Several brief, bedside assessment tools are reviewed. All may be used in the critical care setting to evaluate the type and extent of residual deficits in the neurologically impaired patient. Nursing implications, based on the evaluation of deficits, are also discussed. 
Spontaneous carotid dissection: duplex scanning in diagnosis and management. The clinical, duplex, and angiographic findings in six patients with seven spontaneous extracranial carotid artery dissections are reported. Four dissections resulted in internal carotid artery occlusion. These patients complained of ipsilateral headache followed by contralateral hemiplegia. The other three dissections involved the common carotid artery and resulted in dual (one true and one false) lumens. Two of these dissections were asymptomatic. All dissections were treated nonoperatively with anticoagulant therapy. Neurologic deficits improved or disappeared in all symptomatic patients. On follow-up studies, one of the four internal carotid occlusions completely resolved with normalization of the duplex examination. All three dual lumen dissections remained patent on serial studies. Diagnostic duplex characteristics, both conclusive and supportive, of carotid dissections are described. Duplex scanning is shown to be accurate in diagnosing and ideally suited for serially following spontaneous carotid dissections.
