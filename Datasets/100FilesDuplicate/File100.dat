Role of radiation after operative palliation in cancer of the proximal bile ducts. Cancer of the proximal bile ducts continues to pose a formidable problem to even the most experienced biliary surgeon. From 1977 through 1985, 51 patients with histologically confirmed proximal bile duct cancers underwent surgical treatment. The lesion was confined to the hilar region in 30 patients; there was extensive hepatic infiltration or distant metastatic disease in 21 patients. One patient underwent resection. Biopsy only was performed in six patients. In the remaining 44 patients, transtumoral dilation and intubation were performed. These 44 patients were further analyzed with regard to how survival was affected by the presence of metastatic disease and by the adjunctive use of radiation therapy. Mean survival in those patients with metastatic disease (n = 16) was 6.1 months, and survival was not improved by the use of postoperative radiation. In the absence of metastatic or advanced local disease, however, the addition of external beam radiation did significantly extend the mean survival from 4.5 to 12.2 months and the median survival from 2.2 to 12.2 months. The operative mortality for the series was 14% and postoperative complications occurred in 18 patients. These findings suggest that the addition of external beam radiation improves survival in patients undergoing palliative treatment of hilar tumors. Further confirmation of the value of radiation awaits prospective investigation. 
Induction of preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge and prevention of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. OBJECTIVE: To use gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) instead of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to induce oocyte maturation for in vitro fertilization (IVF). DESIGN: Pituitary and ovarian responses to GnRH-a and the outcome of IVF were studied prospectively. Data from patients injected with hCG were analyzed retrospectively. SETTING: Program of IVF at the Rambam (Governmental) Hospital, Haifa, Israel. PATIENTS AND INTERVENTIONS: One or two doses of buserelin acetate 250 to 500 micrograms were administered to six patients with moderate response (Estradiol [E2], 1,494 +/- 422 [+/- SD] pg/mL) and 8 patients with exaggerated response (E2, 7,673 +/- 3,028 pg/mL) to gonadotropin stimulation. Progesterone (P) and E2 were administered for luteal support. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist effectively triggered luteinizing hormone (LH)/follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) surge. Mature oocytes were recovered in all patients. Luteal E2 and P were lower than in patients injected with hCG. No signs of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome were observed. RESULTS: Serum LH and FSH rose over 4 and 12 hours, respectively, and were significantly (P less than 0.05) elevated for 24 hours. Of all mature oocytes, 67% fertilized and 82% cleaved. Four pregnancies were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: A bolus of GnRH-a is able to trigger an adequate midcycle LH/FSH surge, resulting in oocyte maturation and pregnancy. Our preliminary results also suggest that it allows a more accurate control of ovarian steroid levels during the luteal phase and may prevent the clinical manifestation of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. 
Interaction between dactinomycin and tumor necrosis factor in mesothelioma. Cachexia without oncolysis. There is no effective therapy for human malignant mesothelioma, and its susceptibility to recombinant cytokines has not been studied extensively. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rHuTNF alpha) was evaluated for its in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity using a human malignant mesothelioma cell line [DeH128(m)], both in culture and heterotransplanted in nude mice. In vitro, rHuTNF alone had no direct antimesothelioma activity assessed using the 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay, but in combination with the transcription inhibitor, dactinomycin (AD), mesothelioma cell metabolic activity was inhibited (80% of control). The effects of this combination of agents were studied on DeH128(m) cells heterotransplanted as subcutaneous tumors in nude mice. In vivo there was no significant inhibition of tumor growth by combined rHuTNF alpha and AD therapy, but the combination produced marked cachexia in doses at which each component (rHuTNF alone or AD alone) was well tolerated. The authors conclude that the well-described in vitro interaction between AD and rHuTNF also operates in vivo to produce cachexia and that the combination of these two agents is likely to have a low therapeutic index in malignant mesothelioma. 
Prevention of neural tube defects: results of the Medical Research Council Vitamin Study. MRC Vitamin Study Research Group. A randomised double-blind prevention trial with a factorial design was conducted at 33 centres in seven countries to determine whether supplementation with folic acid (one of the vitamins in the B group) or a mixture of seven other vitamins (A,D,B1,B2,B6,C and nicotinamide) around the time of conception can prevent neural tube defects (anencephaly, spina bifida, encephalocele). A total of 1817 women at high risk of having a pregnancy with a neural tube defect, because of a previous affected pregnancy, were allocated at random to one of four groups--namely, folic acid, other vitamins, both, or neither. 1195 had a completed pregnancy in which the fetus or infant was known to have or not have a neural tube defect; 27 of these had a known neural tube defect, 6 in the folic acid groups and 21 in the two other groups, a 72% protective effect (relative risk 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.71). The other vitamins showed no significant protective effect (relative risk 0.80, 95% Cl 0.32-1.72). There was no demonstrable harm from the folic acid supplementation, though the ability of the study to detect rare or slight adverse effects was limited. Folic acid supplementation starting before pregnancy can now be firmly recommended for all women who have had an affected pregnancy, and public health measures should be taken to ensure that the diet of all women who may bear children contains an adequate amount of folic acid. 
Thallium-201 scintigraphy after intravenous infusion of adenosine compared with exercise thallium testing in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease Adenosine is an endogenously produced compound that has significant effects as a coronary and systemic vasodilator. Previous studies suggest that intravenous infusion of adenosine, coupled with thallium-201 scintigraphy, may have specific value as a noninvasive means of evaluating coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic value of adenosine thallium testing with that of standard exercise thallium testing. One hundred subjects were studied with exercise thallium imaging and thallium imaging after adenosine infusion, including 47 with angiographically proved coronary artery disease and 53 control subjects. The overall sensitivity of the thallium procedures was 81% for the exercise study and 83% for the adenosine study (p = NS); the specificity was 74% for the exercise study and 75% for the adenosine study (p = NS). The diagnostic accuracy of the exercise study was 77% and that of the adenosine study was 79%. Ninety-four percent of subjects had an adverse effect due to the adenosine infusion; however, most of these effects were mild and well tolerated. All adverse effects abated within 30 to 45 s of the termination of the study, consistent with the very brief half-life of the agent. Thus, thallium-201 scintigraphy after intravenous infusion of adenosine has a diagnostic value similar to that of exercise thallium testing for evaluation of coronary artery disease. Adenosine thallium testing may be particularly useful in evaluating patients unable to perform treadmill exercise testing. 
Evidence for a central but not a peripheral analgesic effect of clomipramine in rats. The effect of clomipramine (CMI), a tricyclic antidepressant, was studied on an acute inflammatory pain model in an attempt to understand its potential antinociceptive activity, the involvement of a central and/or peripheral component and its influence on the inflammatory process. When administered (i.v.) before the inflammatory agent, carrageenan (CAR), CMI (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg) completely prevented the development of the hyperalgesia for 70-120 min according to the doses. This antinociceptive effect was suppressed by naloxone (100 micrograms/kg i.v.) for 65 min. Neither higher doses (1, 2 and 20 mg/kg, i.v.) nor CMI injected into the inflamed paw (15 min before CAR) modified pain thresholds. Moreover, CMI (0.5 and 2 mg/kg, i.v.) administered 15 min before CAR markedly increased the volume of the CAR-induced oedema. These results (1) demonstrate an opioid-dependent antinociceptive effect of CMI on this model, the doses used being lower than those active in thermal or electrical tests, and (2) tend to exclude a peripheral mechanism and an NSAID-like anti-inflammatory activity suggested by previous in vitro studies. 
Management of perioperative hypertension using intravenous isradipine. The antihypertensive action of acute intravenous isradipine was investigated during fentanyl/pancuronium/nitrous oxide anesthesia for noncardiac surgery. An intravenous (iv) infusion of 0.5 mg isradipine (n = 10) or placebo (n = 11) was administered double-blind over 5 min if mean arterial pressure (MAP) was greater than 110 mm Hg. The number of patients with a favorable blood pressure reduction (delta MAP greater than or equal to 10% with MAP less than or equal to 110 mm Hg) was 80% with isradipine and 20% with placebo (P less than .05), and the mean MAP reduction from baseline was 26 +/- 12 and 2 +/- 16 mm Hg, respectively (P less than .001). Due to reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the heart rate increased by 14 +/- 12 beats/min with acute iv isradipine. The antihypertensive effect was sustained for 45 min. Isradipine was also well tolerated. It is concluded that intravenous isradipine is an effective antihypertensive agent for the treatment of perioperative hypertension during noncardiac surgery. 
Temporal association of CD40 antigen expression with discrete stages of human B-cell ontogeny and the efficacy of anti-CD40 immunotoxins against clonogenic B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia as well as B-lineage non-Hodgkin's lymphoma cells. Detailed immunophenotypic analyses of immunologically classified leukemias and lymphomas showed that CD40 displays an exquisite B-lineage specificity within the human lymphopoietic system. Notably, 82% of B-lineage chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs), 82% of B-lineage hairy cell leukemias (HCLs), 86% of B-lineage non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), and 29% of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) were CD40+. Quantitative analyses of the correlated expression of CD40 and other B-lineage differentiation antigens on fetal lymphoid precursor cells by multiparameter two-color/three-color flow cytometry, combined with analyses of sequential antigen expression on fluorescence-activated cell fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS) isolated immunologically distinct fetal B-cell precursor subpopulations during in vitro proliferation and differentiation, provided evidence that the acquisition of CD40 antigen in human B-cell ontogeny occurs subsequent to the expression of CD10 and CD19 antigens but before the surface expression of CD20, CD21, CD22, CD24, and surface immunoglobulin M (sIgM). Some leukemic pro-B cells from ALL patients as well as normal pro-B cell clones from fetal livers displaying germline Ig heavy chain genes were CD40+, indicating that the acquisition of CD40 antigen likely precedes the rearrangement of Ig heavy chain genes. CD40+ FACS-sorted malignant cells from B-lineage ALL as well as B-lineage NHL patients were capable of in vitro clonogenic growth, indicating the CD40 antigen is expressed on clonogenic leukemia and lymphoma cells. This hypothesis was confirmed by the ability of an anti-CD40 immunotoxin that we used as an antigen-specific cytotoxic probe to effectively kill clonogenic B-lineage ALL and NHL cells. 
The C-terminal half of UvrC protein is sufficient to reconstitute (A)BC excinuclease. The UvrC protein is one of three subunits of the Escherichia coli repair enzyme (A)BC excinuclease. This subunit is thought to have at least one of the active sites for nucleophilic attack on the phosphodiester bonds of damaged DNA. To localize the active site, mutant UvrC proteins were constructed by linker-scanning and deletion mutagenesis. In vivo studies revealed that the C-terminal 314 amino acids of the 610-amino acid UvrC protein were sufficient to confer UV resistance to cells lacking the uvrC gene. The portion of the uvrC gene encoding the C-terminal half of the protein was fused to the 3' end of the E. coli malE gene (which encodes maltose binding protein), and the fusion protein MBP-C314C was purified and characterized. The fusion protein, in combination with UvrA and UvrB subunits, reconstituted the excinuclease activity that incised the eighth phosphodiester bond 5' and the fourth phosphodiester bond 3' to a psoralen-thymine adduct. These results suggest that the C-terminal 314 amino acids of UvrC constitute a functional domain capable of interacting with the UvrB-damaged DNA complex and of inducing the two phosphodiester bond incisions characteristic of (A)BC excinuclease. 
Stroke-like episodes in familial mitochondrial encephalomyopathy: clinical and biochemical aspects. Acute episodes of focal neurological dysfunction are a well-recognized complication of the mitochondrial encephalomyopathies. Because of rapid remission, biochemical tests and other diagnostic procedures are mostly performed after the acute phase. We report the case of a patient suffering from mitochondrial disease manifesting primarily with seizures, progressive deafness and dementia, who experienced multiple stroke-like episodes. Other members of the family with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction are presented briefly. EEG and biochemical findings in the acute stage are correlated with clinical symptoms, showing characteristics distinct from the chronic illness. The possible involvement of dietary factors in the provocation of stroke-like episodes is discussed and regulation of glucose intake suggested as a strategy in the prevention of stroke-like episodes. 
Thrombolytic therapy in acute MI. Weighing the risks and benefits. The underlying cause of acute myocardial infarction can now be effectively treated with thrombolytic agents, thereby increasing myocardial salvage and reducing mortality. Clinicians should always be aware of the risk-to-benefit ratio in treating patients with thrombolytic agents and treat each patient on an individual basis. 
A preliminary report of ticarcillin and clavulanate versus triple antibiotic therapy in children with ruptured appendicitis. Standard therapy for childhood ruptured appendicitis includes combination antibiotic therapy with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin. Complicated dosing schedules and the possibility of aminoglycoside toxicity make alternatives desirable. One such alternative is Timentin (a combination agent of ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium). This agent has a more convenient dose schedule than standard therapy and eliminates the possibility of aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity. It is active in vitro against most pathogens associated with ruptured appendicitis in children. The preliminary results of an ongoing prospective, open label, randomized trial comparing ticarcillin and clavulanate with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin in childhood ruptured appendicitis are reported herein. While further evaluation is necessary, we have found single agent therapy with ticarcillin and clavulanate to be equivalent in safety and efficacy to standard combination therapy. Also discussed are the relative merits of immediate versus delayed primary closure of the abdominal wound after appendectomy. 
Blunt cervical spine Brown-Sequard injury. A report of three cases. Cervical spinal cord Brown-Sequard syndrome was diagnosed in three recent victims of blunt injury at the authors' Level II Trauma Center. While anatomic hemisection of the cord, resulting in ipsilateral motor and proprioception loss and contralateral pain and temperature deficit, is a fully understandable concept, in the context of the acute trauma evaluation, these findings may be confusing because they are unexpected. Penetrating trauma is far more likely to cause this uncommon syndrome than vehicular crash, fall, or crushing injury. Pediatric victims frequently have no fracture. Early neurosurgical consultation, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if plain film radiography is uninformative, and consideration for rapid decompression if the deficit and pathologic anatomy warrant, are the recommended approaches. Motor function recovery from blunt injury may be expected within six months, a better prognosis than for penetrating injury causing the syndrome. 
Proliferative and antiproliferative effects of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha on cell lines derived from cervical and ovarian malignancies. Four human cell lines derived from cervical carcinomas (ME-180, SiHa, HT-3, and MS751) and three human cell lines derived from ovarian carcinomas (SK-OV-3, Caov-3, and NIH:OVCAR-3) were analyzed in vitro to determine the effect of recombinant interferon-gamma and recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha on cell growth and survival. The effects of interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and both interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha on cell growth were measured after 24 and 72 hours of incubation by the incorporation of chromium 51. The results of this analysis showed that all seven cell lines were resistant to the antiproliferative action of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, that the growth of most cell lines was inhibited by interferon-gamma by 72 hours of incubation, and that after 72 hours of incubation all cell lines demonstrated a synergistic antiproliferative response to the combination of interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. However, the effects of these cytokines on cell growth were found to differ among cell lines and varied with the concentration and the duration of incubation. The growth of one cell line (Caov-3) was stimulated by both tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma. These results suggest that the clinical effects of these cytokines on the growth of gynecologic cancers may be more complex than previously supposed. 
Small bowel tumours: yield of enteroscopy. A total of 258 patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding were referred for small bowel enteroscopy, a procedure which allows endoscopic evaluation of most of the small intestine. A small bowel tumour was found in 5% of patients. In 50% of patients no diagnosis could be made, but when the cause of obscure bleeding was discovered small bowel tumours were the single most common lesion in patients younger than 50 years. Small bowel tumours causing gastrointestinal bleeding may remain undetected despite extensive diagnostic evaluation. We conclude that small bowel tumours are the most common cause of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in patients less than 50 years of age. Small bowel enteroscopy is diagnostic of small bowel tumours even when all previous diagnostic studies, including enteroclysis and angiography, are negative. 
Adrenal activation and the prolactin response to exercise in eumenorrheic and amenorrheic runners. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, and prolactin responses following maximal and submaximal (40 min at 80% maximal O2 consumption) running were studied in eumenorrheic (ER; n = 8, 29.0 +/- 1.5 yr) and amenorrheic (AR; n = 8, 24.5 +/- 2.0 yr) runners. ER were studied in the early follicular and midluteal phases of the menstrual cycle. Physical, training, and gynecological characteristics were similar, and cardiorespiratory and metabolic responses to the exercises were indistinguishable in the groups. ACTH, cortisol, and prolactin data from the follicular luteal phases in ER were combined for comparison to AR, because no differences were noted between the menstrual phases at rest. Similar preexercise ACTH levels and responses following exercise occurred in both groups, but preexercise cortisol levels were elevated (ER = 293.1 +/- 46.3, AR = 479.6 +/- 42.4 nmol/l) and cortisol responses blunted in AR. Adrenal sensitivity was blunted in AR compared with ER after submaximal (ER = 121.9 +/- 17.4, AR = 51.7 +/- 13.6) and maximal exercise (ER = 27.9 +/- 9.2, AR = 12.1 +/- 3.8). Preexercise prolactin levels were reduced (ER = 16.4 +/- 2.7, AR = 10 +/- 2.3 micrograms/l), and prolactin responses to maximal exercises were blunted in AR, despite high lactate levels (11.4 +/- 0.4 mmol/l). We conclude that 1) control for menstrual phase in ER is important in studies of prolactin responses following exercise but not in studies of ACTH and cortisol responses following exercise, 2) cortisol responses following submaximal and maximal exercise in AR are blunted at the adrenal level, 3) prolactin responses following submaximal and maximal exercise are also blunted in AR, and 4) prolactin responses following exercise may be mediated by adrenal activation. 
Circus movement atrial flutter in canine sterile pericarditis model. Activation patterns during entrainment and termination of single-loop reentry in vivo. BACKGROUND. Recently, we used a custom designed "jacket" electrode with 127 bipolar electrodes in a flexible nylon matrix to map the total atrial epicardial surface in the in situ canine heart. Atrial flutter in dogs with sterile pericarditis was shown to be due to a single wave front circulating around a combined functional/anatomic obstacle, with the arc of functional conduction block contiguous with one or more of the atrial vessels. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, this model was used to analyze the activation pattern during pacing-induced entrainment and termination of single reentrant loops in a syncytium without anatomically predetermined pathways. Sustained atrial flutter was induced in five dogs with 3-5-day-old sterile pericarditis. Atrial pacing at a cycle length 5-30 msec shorter than the spontaneous cycle length entrained the arrhythmia and could result in a "classical" activation pattern, characterized by an antidromic stimulated wave that collided with the reentrant orthodromic wave front of the previous beat at a constant site. However, two variations of this classical activation pattern were also observed: 1) Pacing at short cycle lengths could lead to localized conduction block in antidromic direction, forcing a change in the pathway of the antidromic wave front. This could prevent the expected shift of the site of collision in antidromic direction. 2) The stimulated orthodromic wave front could also use a pathway different from that of the original reentrant impulse, so that a different circuit was active during the pacing period. Termination of atrial flutter by rapid atrial stimulation was associated with progressive slowing and finally blocking of the paced orthodromic wave front and a progressive shift of the site of collision in antidromic direction. The occurrence of conduction block was determined by the cycle length of stimulation and the number of stimulated beats. A longer train at the critical cycle length or the critical number of beats at a shorter cycle length could reinduce the same reentrant circuit or a different reentrant circuit, respectively, during stimulated cycles following the beat that terminated reentry. CONCLUSIONS. The epicardial activation sequence during entrainment of reentrant arrhythmias does not necessarily follow a standard activation pattern. Instead, the stimulated orthodromic as well as the antidromic wave front might use a pathway different from that of the original reentrant wave front. The mechanisms of termination, failure of termination, and reinitiation of single-loop reentry are similar to those in the "figure-eight" reentrant circuit. 
Inguinal hernia repair in early infancy. Controversy regarding the management of inguinal hernias in young infants stimulated this study. It was our hypothesis that inguinal hernia in young infants can and should be repaired at the time of presentation. In order to address this issue, the following questions were examined: How frequently are these hernias incarcerated and how should this be managed? What is the best timing of repair? Should the asymptomatic contralateral groin be explored? How do the recurrence and complication rates compare with those in older children? Have advances in anesthesia affected the treatment of these infants? The records of 384 infants less than 2 months of age who underwent inguinal herniorrhaphy from January 1985 to January 1990 at Children's Hospital and Medical Center in Seattle were reviewed. Nearly one fourth (24%) of the patients had incarcerated hernias. Preoperative reduction was successful 96% of the time. The hernia was then repaired within 48 hours. Six patients required urgent operation, but bowel resection was not necessary in any. Contralateral groin exploration was performed 96% of the time and was positive in 85%. The recurrence rate was 1.0%. Complications occurred in 2.3% of patients. There were no hernia-related deaths. Spinal anesthesia was used in 63 patients with no postoperative apnea. An aggressive approach toward prompt repair of hernias in this age group can result in a very low incidence of hernia-related complications. Repair can be carried out safely in the first 2 months of life with recurrence and complication rates comparable with those in older children. Spinal anesthesia may lower the rate of postoperative apnea. 
Granulomatous vasculitis occurring after cutaneous herpes zoster despite absence of viral genome. Granuloma annulare, sarcoidal and other granulomatous dermatitides, pseudolymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma have been described as sequelae of herpes zoster. We report a new postzoster reaction, granulomatous vasculitis, that caused flat-topped papules restricted to the affected dermatome. Polymerase chain reaction failed to detect varicella-zoster virus in a biopsy specimen. These results suggest that granulomatous vasculitis occurs without persistence of the viral genome and, perhaps, is a reaction to minute amounts of viral proteins. 
Squamous carcinoma of the temporal bone: a revised staging. Carcinoma of the middle ear is a difficult tumour to treat. We present ten cases and discuss staging of these tumours. Our results would suggest that a revised staging system may allow better identification of patients that would benefit from surgery whilst sparing some multilating surgery that offers little to improve their quality or quantity of life. 
Predictive value of brainstem evoked response in the diagnosis of acoustic neuroma. Predictive value positive is the probability that a positive test result represents a true positive finding. Twenty-six patients with brainstem evoked response findings characteristic of retrocochlear hearing loss were studied. Four acoustic neuromas were diagnosed in this group after radiologic workup. The predictive value in this population was 15%. Statistical considerations are presented. 
Development of gastric dysplasia in pernicious anaemia: a clinical and endoscopic follow up study of 80 patients. The development of gastric dysplasia and neoplasia in patients with pernicious anaemia has been evaluated in a prospective clinical and endoscopic follow up study. After initial screening of 80 patients between 1978 and 1980, one patient underwent total gastrectomy for a gastric malignancy and 12 were kept under surveillance and underwent endoscopy at a mean interval of 14 months. In the remaining 67 patients further investigation was attempted six to seven years after the initial investigation. The continuous follow up study identified carcinoids in one patient and an adenoma with severe dysplasia in a further patient. The grade and site of mucosal dysplasia differed from one investigation to the next, but no overall progression was observed. Of the 79 patients, eight had died by the time of the reinvestigation, two of unknown cause and six of causes unrelated to pernicious anaemia. In 38 of the remaining 71 patients, clinical data only were available, with no evidence of new gastric malignancy. In 27 patients it was possible to perform an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, when no change in the degree of dysplasia was detected. In six patients no follow up information was obtainable. In conclusion, patients with pernicious anaemia should be investigated by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy soon after diagnosis. Polyps should be removed wherever possible. In the presence of severe mucosal dysplasia or polyps that are not removed, frequent reinvestigation should be performed, provided the patient is eligible for gastric surgery. In the remaining patients, follow up endoscopies at about five year intervals would seem sufficient. 
Outpatient liver biopsy: one man's experience. As an academically based gastroenterologist, I performed 94 outpatient liver biopsies over a 42-month period, using the standard suction technique. Differential blood count and vital signs were monitored, with no statistically significant postbiopsy changes noted in the group at large. One patient required admission to the hospital for bleeding, and six patients required intramuscular analgesics for pain at the biopsy site. Four patients had bradycardia, and one of them required atropine for bradycardia and hypotension. Outpatient liver biopsy is a safe procedure with low morbidity and complication rate. It would appear that prolonged monitoring is not necessary. 
Trauma-precipitated migrainous hemiparesis. Migraine is a pleomorphic condition in which neurologic manifestations may be absent or a minor or a major feature. Similarly, head injury may range from trivial to lethal with regard to neurologic morbidity. Migraine may be precipitated by a variety of stimuli, including head trauma, significant or trivial. Presented is the case of a patient with migrainous hemiparesis precipitated by minor head injury. The clinical features and laboratory and radiological findings of trauma-precipitated migraine are reviewed. 
Fatal disseminated hemorrhagic toxoplasmic encephalitis as the initial manifestation of AIDS. A 28-year-old woman presented with progressive coma after being asymptomatic for 1 year after the demonstration of seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus and high serum immunoglobulin G toxoplasma titers. Computed tomographic scanning showed multiple rounded cerebral hemorrhages and massive cerebral edema. Postmortem examination disclosed Toxoplasma gondii cysts scattered throughout the brain. An overwhelming fatal toxoplasmosis associated with multiple cerebral hemorrhages may be the first presentation of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. We raise the possibility that frequent neuroradiological monitoring may be indicated in asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with high immunoglobulin G toxoplasma titers. 
Inhibitory effect of interleukin-4 on the in vitro growth of Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. We investigated the effect of recombinant human interleukin-4 (rhIL-4) on the in vitro growth of human leukemia cells in liquid culture and 3H-thymidine incorporation and found inhibitory effects on the growth of leukemic cells from patients with Ph1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph1 ALL) and three Ph1 ALL cell lines. However, no inhibitory effects were seen in Ph1-positive leukemic cell lines derived from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis and various types of Ph1-negative leukemia cells, including B-lineage leukemia cells. In a flow cytometry assay of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), all three Ph1-positive ALL cell lines showed the presence of IL-4R on their cell surfaces, and the IL-4-dependent inhibition on the growth of Ph1-positive ALL cells was abrogated by the addition of either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against rhIL-4. Other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-CSF, and IL-6, showed no inhibitory effects on the growth of Ph1-ALL cells, but tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN)-alpha, -beta, and -gamma displayed slight inhibitory effects in a high concentration. The growth inhibition induced by rhIL-4 in the Ph1-positive ALL cells was not abrogated by the addition of antibodies against either IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha. Furthermore, these cells showed no significant production of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma or TNF-alpha after exposure to rhIL-4, thus indicating that the growth inhibition of Ph1-positive ALL cells by rhIL-4 is not associated with IL-4-stimulating production of these factors. rhIL-4 caused significant inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity in these Ph1-positive ALL cells, similar to Herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase that inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity in these cells. Our finding suggests that the clinical evaluation of rhIL-4 may offer promising therapeutic possibilities for patients with Ph1-positive ALL. 
A myocutaneous flap for closure of upper arm amputations for uncontrolled axillary tumors. Tumor spread or recurrence in the axilla is usually treated with nodal dissections. At times disease recurrence is uncontrolled, causing significant morbidity including pain, bleeding, lymphedema, and neurologic symptoms. Previously, forequarter amputation has been the treatment for this problem, resulting in a significant cosmetic and functional deficit. This report describes a novel myocutaneous flap that can be used to cover soft tissue defects after major disarticulations of the upper extremity. The deltoid myocutaneous flap has been used to successfully treat three patients with uncontrolled tumors in the axilla and preserve the shoulder structures to lessen the functional deficit. 
Realistic expectations for the patient with intermittent claudication. To determine the natural history of intermittent claudication 112 patients were followed for a minimum of 5 years and a median period of 82 months. Thirty-seven patients (33 per cent) died during the study period. Myocardial infarction (44 per cent) and cerebrovascular disease (28 per cent) were the most common causes of death. Overall mortality rate was 8, 23 and 40 per cent, at 2, 5 and 8 years respectively. Initial ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) correlated with subsequent death. With an initial ABPI less than 0.5 death occurred in 20, 50 and 69 per cent at 2, 5 and 7 years respectively, compared with 5, 16 and 24 per cent respectively for those with an initial ABPI greater than or equal to 0.5 (P less than 0.0001). Of the survivors only 21 per cent had worsening claudication and 13 per cent progressed to critical ischaemia. Arterial bypass for limb salvage was required in eight patients and four limbs were lost during the study period. ABPI identifies a subgroup of claudicants with an extremely high risk of death from coronary and/or cerebral pathology. In this subgroup an aggressive approach to the correction of atherosclerotic risk factors, rather than emphasis on the peripheral vascular problem alone, may improve survival. 
Direct correlation of cytogenetic findings with cell morphology using in situ hybridization: an analysis of suspicious cells in bone marrow specimens of two patients completing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Bone marrow cells from two pediatric patients completing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia were studied using in situ hybridization with an alpha-satellite DNA probe specific for chromosome 17. Morphologic analysis of the end-therapy specimens from each patient had shown small numbers (7.5%, 8.5%) of cells that were suspicious for residual or recurrent disease. These cells could not be morphologically or immunophenotypically distinguished with certainty from immature lymphoid cells (hematogones), which may be present normally, sometimes in increased numbers, in the bone marrow specimens of children. In situ hybridization with a probe to chromosome 17 was used because the leukemic cells from each patient had originally been shown to have an extra copy of this chromosome. In one patient, in situ studies showed a population of cells (106 of 1,000 cells) with three hybridization signals indicating trisomy 17, and thus residual/recurrent leukemia. In the other patient trisomy 17 could not be detected. Additional hybridizations to previously stained bone marrow aspirate smears permitted a direct correlation of the cytogenetic findings with the suspicious cells on a cell-to-cell basis. The questionable cells were identified, photographed, and then re-examined after hybridization. In one patient, 13 of 18 (72%) of the suspicious cells were found to have trisomy 17, whereas in the other patient 0 of 24 (0%) demonstrated an extra copy of this chromosome. These cases illustrate a clinical application of interphase cytogenetic analysis and demonstrate how this technology can be used for direct correlation of cytogenetic findings with cell morphology. This technique should prove useful for the detection of minimal residual disease and for lineage studies in leukemia and myelodysplasia. 
Relations between heart rate, ischemia, and drug therapy during daily life in patients with coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND. Previous studies have shown that little if any increase in heart rate occurs 1 minute before the onset of ischemia in ambulant patients with coronary artery disease. This study tested the hypothesis that there are characteristic relations between heart rate and ischemia in ambulant patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS AND RESULTS. Twenty-one patients with proven coronary disease demonstrated 212 episodes of ischemia during 504 hours of continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram. An important increase in heart rate (from 74 +/- 11 to 90 +/- 14 beats/min, p less than 0.001) occurred between 5 and 30 minutes (not 1 minute) before the onset of ischemia. A significantly higher heart rate at onset of ischemia was seen during Bruce protocol exercise testing than during daily life (117 +/- 12 versus 95 +/- 15 beats/min, p less than 0.01). However, when a less-strenuous, but more prolonged, exercise protocol was used in a subgroup of patients (n = 12), ischemia occurred at a heart rate that was significantly lower than during the Bruce protocol (88 +/- 14 versus 103 +/- 15 beats/min, p less than 0.05) and was not significantly different from the threshold heart rate at onset of ischemia during daily life (88 +/- 14 versus 84 +/- 12 beats/min, p = NS). As part of two placebo-controlled trials, treatment with both propranolol and nitroglycerin altered the distribution of ischemic events by heart rate but in opposite directions. Although propranolol largely eliminated events occurring at high (greater than 100 beats/min) and moderate (80-100 beats/min) heart rates, the number of events at low (less than 80 beats/min) heart rates was increased. In contrast, nitroglycerin reduced episodes at low and moderate heart rates only. CONCLUSIONS. Important increases in heart rate occur before the onset of ischemia during daily life, but this increase occurs much earlier than has been reported. Duration of heart rate increase appears to influence the heart rate threshold for ischemia, and this may contribute to the occurrence of ischemia at lower heart rates during daily life than during standard exercise testing. Last, different classes of drugs appear to have characteristic effects on ischemia occurring at different heart rates that may be useful in planning therapy. 
The "ultraperipheral" revascularization in arteriosclerotic obstruction of tibial vessels. Experimental study. In arteriosclerotic obstruction of the main tibial arteries, the tibial collateral vessels are usually patent, and about 70% of these arteries are potentially suitable for surgical revascularization. The present study aimed at investigating the practical feasibility of a selective revascularization procedure on these tibial muscular arteries (ultraperipheral revascularization). Six lower limbs amputated at thigh level for arteriosclerotic gangrene with complete obstruction of the main tibial arteries, were studied: the tibial collateral muscular vessels showed patency in 65% of cases. The authors propose a surgical technique for the revascularization of these peripheral vessels with the use of a vascular prosthesis. The "post-operative" angiographic studies showed that revascularization of these peripheral muscular arteries was possible. 
Hemangiomas and vascular malformations. Vascular lesions in the neonate and infant are categorized as hemangiomas or malformations. Although their appearances may be similar, the pathobiology, natural history, and prognosis of these lesions are different. Selected important syndromes that are characterized as hemangiomas and vascular malformations are discussed, and an update on what is new in treatment, including laser therapy, is presented. 
Increased prevalence of hereditary metabolic diseases among native Indians in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario. OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of hereditary metabolic diseases in the native and non-native populations of Manitoba and northwestern Ontario. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Children's Hospital, Winnipeg. PATIENTS: Patients were selected by three methods: laboratory tests designed to screen patients suspected of having a metabolic disease, laboratory investigation of newborn infants with abnormalities detected through screening, and investigation of near relatives of probands with disease. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients with organic acid, amino acid and carbohydrate disorders were seen from 1960 to 1990. Of these, 49 (36%) were native Indians (Algonkian linguistic group). This was in sharp contrast to the proportion of native Indians in the total study population (5.8%). Congenital lactic acidosis due to pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (13 patients), glutaric aciduria type I (14 patients) and primary hyperoxaluria type II (8 patients) were the most common disorders detected. Other rare disorders included glutaric aciduria type II (one patient), 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (one patient) and sarcosinemia (one patient). Underreporting, especially of glutaric aciduria type I and hyperoxaluria type II, was likely in the native population. CONCLUSIONS: Hereditary metabolic diseases are greatly overrepresented in the native population of Manitoba and northwestern Ontario. We recommend that native children who present with illnesses involving disturbances of acid-base balance or with neurologic, renal or liver disease of unknown cause by investigated for a possible metabolic disorder. 
Plasma catecholamine levels in cyclic antidepressant overdose. Cyclic antidepressant overdose is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in self-poisoned patients. The major cause of mortality with cyclic antidepressant overdose is cardiotoxicity. We determined plasma catecholamine levels in 41 symptomatic acute overdose patients to identify interactions between QRS duration (a marker for cardiotoxicity) and a presumed hyper-adrenergic state. Using a linear multivariable regression analysis, QRS duration correlated with the presence of cyclic antidepressant, plasma norepinephrine levels, the ratio of norepinephrine to epinephrine level, and pulse rate (p less than 0.001, r2 = 0.42). Commensurate physiologic changes were not found in the presence of elevated catecholamine levels in the cyclic antidepressant overdose group. One possible explanation for the blunted systemic response to the elevated catecholamine levels is adrenergic desensitization. Investigation of serial catecholamine levels during cyclic antidepressant overdose may lead to modification of our current theories of cardiotoxicity and therapy. 
Diastolic time in diabetes. Impairment of diastolic time during dynamic exercise in type 2 diabetes with retinopathy. To evaluate the effect of microangiopathic complications and autonomic dysfunction on diastolic time (DT) during dynamic exercise, 19 patients with type 2 diabetes and ten normal subjects were studied using ear densitography. All subjects had neither an ischemic electrocardiographic response nor chest pain during maximal treadmill exercise. The DT and heart rate (HR) had an inverse nonlinear relation, and electromechanical systole (QS2) and HR had an inverse linear relation during exercise. When the exercise DT-HR and QS2-HR relations were compared, a significant lengthening of QS2, with a consequent shortening of DT, was observed in diabetic patients with retinopathy, compared to patients without retinopathy and normal subjects (p less than 0.005), while no significant differences were found between diabetic patients without retinopathy and normal subjects; however, there were no significant differences in the exercise DT-HR and QS2-HR relations among diabetic patients with and without autonomic dysfunction and normal subjects. A more prominent abbreviation in the diastolic perfusion time observed in patients with retinopathy would be meaningful because microangiopathy might already have limited subendocardial blood flow. Thus, patients with type 2 diabetes who have retinopathy have a potential risk of aggravation of left ventricular function through the deterioration of myocardial blood flow. 
The effects of cyclobenzaprine on sleep physiology and symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia. A double blind, placebo controlled, crossover design study examined overnight sleep physiology, pain, fatigue, and mood symptoms in 12 patients with fibromyalgia treated with cyclobenzaprine. Nine patients completed the study. Patients receiving cyclobenzaprine showed a decrease in evening fatigue (F = 4.7, p less than 0.05) and an increase in total sleep time (F = 4.4, p less than 0.05). Pain, including tender point count and dolorimetry, mood ratings, and alpha non-REM EEG sleep anomaly were unchanged by cyclobenzaprine. 
Mediastinal nodal involvement and the prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer. We evaluated the effect of mediastinal lymph node metastasis on survival in 233 non-small cell lung cancer patients (N2 disease in 199 patients and N3 disease in 34 patients). Of the 199 patients with N2 disease, 144 underwent curative resection. The five-year survival rate of these 144 patients was 20.3 percent, which was significantly better than that of either the noncuratively resected N2 group or the N3 group. Nodal metastases in the curatively resected patients involved superior and inferior mediastinum irrespective of the location of the primary tumor. Patients with right-sided N2 lesions and metastases to the superior mediastinum had a worse survival than those with metastases to the inferior mediastinum. In contrast, patients with left-sided N2 lesions metastasizing to the inferior mediastinum had a significantly worse survival than those with lesions metastasizing to the superior mediastinum. Patients with single-level metastases had a significantly better survival rate than those with multilevel metastases. Subcarinal nodal involvement had an unfavorable effect in case of single-level metastasis, but did not affect the survival in cases of multilevel metastases. Our present study indicated that the survival of patients with N2 disease was affected by the operative radicality, by the number of levels of metastases, and also by the location of the nodal involvement. It seems appropriate that extensive mediastinal dissection should be performed irrespective of the location of the primary tumor. 
Expression of a partially deleted gene of human type II procollagen (COL2A1) in transgenic mice produces a chondrodysplasia. A minigene version of the human gene for type II procollagen (COL2A1) was prepared that lacked a large central region containing 12 of the 52 exons and therefore 291 of the 1523 codons of the gene. The construct was modeled after sporadic in-frame deletions of collagen genes that cause synthesis of shortened pro alpha chains that associate with normal pro alpha chains and thereby cause degradation of the shortened and normal pro alpha chains through a process called procollagen suicide. The gene construct was used to prepare five lines of transgenic mice expressing the minigene. A large proportion of the mice expressing the minigene developed a phenotype of a chondrodysplasia with dwarfism, short and thick limbs, a short snout, a cranial bulge, a cleft palate, and delayed mineralization of bone. A number of mice died shortly after birth. Microscopic examination of cartilage revealed decreased density and organization of collagen fibrils. In cultured chondrocytes from the transgenic mice, the minigene was expressed as shortened pro alpha 1(II) chains that were disulfide-linked to normal mouse pro alpha 1(II) chains. Therefore, the phenotype is probably explained by depletion of the endogenous mouse type II procollagen through the phenomenon of procollagen suicide. 
Submaximal exercise thallium-201 SPECT for assessment of interventional therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Submaximal thallium-201 stress testing has been shown to provide important diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the diagnostic value of early submaximal stress testing and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after interventional therapy. Scintigraphic results from 56 patients with infarctions, who underwent acute thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, or both, were compared with late (6 weeks) functional outcome as assessed by radionuclide ventriculography and with results of discharge coronary angiography. A linear correlation was found between the extent of thallium-201 SPECT perfusion defect and late ventricular function (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01). Forty-two percent of patients with large SPECT perfusion defects had normal left ventricular ejection fractions, suggesting an overestimation of infarct size by early imaging. Sensitivity and specificity of thallium-201 SPECT for detection of coronary artery stenosis in noninfarct territories was 57% and 46%, respectively, indicating limited diagnostic definition of extent of underlying coronary artery disease. Results of follow-up coronary angiography showed a significant relationship between the size of the initial perfusion defect and early restenosis or reocclusion of the infarct artery. Thus the extent of early thallium-201 perfusion defects correlates with late functional outcome but appears to overestimate the degree of injury. Submaximal thallium-201 stress testing allows only limited characterization of underlying coronary artery disease. Early assessment of infarct size may identify a patient population at high risk for reocclusion of the infarct artery. 
Evaluation and treatment of blunt renal trauma. We examined retrospectively the records of 126 patients with blunt renal trauma to determine the criteria for radiological investigations and the imaging study of choice. Of the 3,993 patients admitted to our regional trauma unit during the last 13 years 126 (3.1%) had blunt renal trauma. Mean patient age was 32 years (range 13 to 87 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 3:1. Mean followup was 7 months (median 4 months). Of the patients 72% had a minor renal injury, 17% had a moderate injury and 11% had a major renal injury. Treatment was conservative in 114 patients, while 9 underwent a genitourinary operation. Results were excellent in 87% of the patients and good in 8%, while 5% failed treatment. All patients who had microscopic hematuria without shock had minor injuries. Excretory urograms (IVPs) were normal in 74% and 39% of the patients when performed for minor and moderate renal injuries, respectively. Computerized tomography (CT) was abnormal in all cases when performed, and was more sensitive and specific than an IVP. Therefore, the majority of patients with blunt renal trauma can be treated conservatively with an excellent result. Furthermore, radiological investigations are not needed in those with microscopic hematuria and no shock. When radiological investigations are indicated a CT scan is the imaging study of choice. 
Role of high total protein in gallbladder bile in the formation of cholesterol gallstones. While it is generally accepted that cholesterol supersaturation of bile is of key importance in the rapid formation of cholesterol crystals, the role of total biliary protein and pH in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones is less well understood. The relation of cholesterol saturation, total protein, and pH was studied in 73 gallbladder bile samples with and 35 gallbladder bile samples without cholesterol crystals. In samples containing crystals, a trend to higher values of cholesterol and to a higher cholesterol saturation index was observed. However, significantly (P = 0.02) higher concentrations of total protein were found in samples with crystals [0.80 +/- 0.40 g/dL (8.0 +/- 4.0 g/L)] than in samples without crystals [0.63 +/- 0.26 g/dL (6.3 +/- 2.6 g/L)]. Moreover, of 22 bile samples with total protein concentrations greater than 10.0 g/L, cholesterol crystals were detected in all but 2. Total lipids, bile acids, phospholipids, and pH values were not significantly different in the two groups of bile samples. It was concluded that high biliary protein concentrations are frequently associated with cholesterol crystals and may, therefore, be a possible risk factor in the pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones. 
In vivo measurements of relative motion between an uncemented femoral total hip component and the femur by roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis. Roentgen stereophotogrammetric analysis (RSA) was used to study rotation and subsidence of an uncemented polyethylene-coated femoral component for total hip arthroplasty in ten patients younger than 55 years of age. Three years postoperatively, the total subsidence averaged 2.44 mm and the internal rotation was 7.4 degrees. The rate of subsidence decreased between the observation periods, whereas the rate of rotation, after an initial significant decrease, became almost constant. One patient, who was a clinical failure and required revision arthroplasty, had a significantly higher rate of migration after six months. The pattern of subsidence in the absence of pain might be the normal reaction of bone to an uncemented prosthesis, but the continuing rotation suggests the potential for failure of the arthroplasty. The type of analysis made possible in RSA may allow early prediction of the success of arthroplasties and significantly speed the design cycle for arthroplasty components. 
Desmoplastic fibroma of the maxillary sinus. Report of a case and review of the literature. A desmoplastic fibroma of the maxillary sinus is reported in a 15-year-old boy. Desmoplastic fibroma is a rare benign tumor in the maxillofacial region. The features of this case and of 49 previously described lesions are analyzed and discussed. 
Aortoiliac surgery in renal transplant patients. Fifteen patients who had undergone renal transplantation 3 months to 25 years earlier were operated on for treatment of complicated aortoiliac atherosclerosis; eight had aneurysms and seven had stenotic or obstructive lesions. Except for the first patient, operated on in 1973, in whom the kidney was protected by general hypothermia, no special measure was used to protect the kidneys. A transient increase in creatinemia occurred in 11 patients during the postoperative period, whereas creatinine values remained unchanged in the other four. All patients had regained renal function identical to the + preoperative state in less than 10 days; three of them had significant improvement as a result of correction of a lesion that was impairing renal blood flow. Results obtained in this series show that protection of the transplant during aortic surgery is not necessary, provided an adequate surgical technique is used. This technique avoids the complex methods employed in the majority of previously reported cases and appears to be a safe procedure. 
Polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma of minor salivary gland. A comparative histologic and immunohistochemical study. Sixteen polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas were reviewed and compared with 17 adenoid cystic carcinomas and with 21 other histologically similar minor salivary gland neoplasms. The polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas were for the most part distinctive in their microscopic appearance. Typically they exhibited infiltrative growth by small uniform cells in single-layered ducts. A syncytium of tumor cells was also characteristic, although solid and cribriform patterns were seen, making definitive diagnosis difficult with some tumors. Immunohistochemical staining for S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, actin, vimentin, and keratins resulted in relatively distinctive antigenic profiles for the tumors studied. Of significance was strong S-100 protein and weak actin staining of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinomas, moderate actin staining of adenoid cystic carcinomas, moderate glial fibrillary acidic protein staining of monomorphic adenomas and pleomorphic adenomas, and nonreactivity of monomorphic adenomas for vimentin. It is believed that the immunoprofiles could be useful in the microscopic diagnosis of salivary gland tumors. The identification of antigens found normally in myoepithelial and epithelial cells supports the concept that these tumors are derived from pluripotential reserve cells. 
Left ventricular mass index and diastolic filling. Relation to blood pressure and demographic variables in a healthy biracial sample. The relationships of left ventricular (LV) structure and diastolic filling to ambulatory blood pressure, race, age, and gender were studied in 104 young, generally healthy, untreated subjects with normal or marginally elevated blood pressure. Average daytime systolic blood pressure (r = 0.41, P less than .001), diastolic blood pressure (r = 0.38, P less than .001), male gender (r = 0.49, P less than .001), and age (r = 0.32, P less than .001) were univariate correlates of LV mass index as measured by M-mode echocardiography. In a stepwise multiple regression model, male gender, age, and systolic blood pressure were independent predictors of LV mass index. LV filling rate normalized to mitral stroke volume, a Doppler-derived index of diastolic filling, was inversely related to age (r = -0.47, P less than .001), heart rate (r = -0.27, P less than .01), LV mass index (r = -0.32, P less than .001), and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.20, P less than .05). Age, heart rate, and LV mass index were predictors of normalized peak filling in a stepwise regression model. Race was not significantly related to either LV mass index or diastolic filling. Our results confirm the importance of demographic variables as well as blood pressure in determining LV mass and filling characteristics in humans prior to the development of sustained essential hypertension. These variables contribute to ventricular mass and diastolic function in varying degrees. Gender is strongly correlated with LV mass, but not with filling indices. 
Delays in the discharge of elderly patients. This paper reports a prospective study of the incidence and magnitude of delays in the discharge of 80 elderly (65+ years old) patients admitted to two general medical services in teaching hospitals in Edmonton, Alberta. The average length of stay was 16.6 days. Discharges were delayed in 14% (11/80) patients, accounting for 21% of the total days stay. Patients whose discharge was delayed tended to be older, to have delirium and/or dementia, to more often come from or require transfer to long term care (LTC) institutions, and/or to be dependent in essential activities of daily living. The 4-Score, an index for predicting non-medical days, was useful in identifying patients at risk for delays in discharge, and had a sensitivity of 0.82, and a specificity of 0.90. Interventions to reduce delays in discharge must address the frail nature of the patients, their lack of support and existing administrative relationships with LTC institutions. Acute care hospitals will likely need to undertake formal programs for the long term care of many of these patients. 
Videoendoscopic evaluation of patients with dysphagia: an adjunct to the modified barium swallow. The modified barium swallow is currently the most comprehensive, widely available, and easily interpreted technique for the evaluation of patients with dysphagia by the head and neck surgeon. However, it requires the facilities, personnel, and use of a radiology suite, a trained speech pathologist, and exposure of the patient to radiation. It would therefore be helpful to have an adjunctive, physician based, nonradiographic method of examination that could provide information similar to and possibly even more complete than that supplied by the modified barium swallow. Such an adjunctive method could help otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeons confronted by a new patient with swallowing difficulties to orient themselves to the nature and severity of the problem while waiting for the modified barium swallow to be scheduled, performed, and reviewed. It could also be a helpful tool for management of patients with cancer of the head and neck, whose swallowing function may change rapidly in the early postoperative period. In such cases, intervals between modified barium swallow examinations (dictated by concern over radiation exposure) may be too far apart to allow up-to-the-minute decisions on case management. Finally, some patients who may be too ill to travel to the radiology suite might benefit from a bedside procedure that would yield information about swallowing function similar to that provided by the modified barium swallow. Videoendoscopic evaluation of dysphagia (VEED) is a protocol I developed and have used regularly since 1984. Experience with this method of dysphagia evaluation has shown that it answers the needs outlined above. Its usefulness also goes beyond that of the modified barium swallow by providing a more detailed understanding of the component anatomic and functional deficits that comprise a given patient's swallowing problem, information about upper aerodigestive tract sensory deficits, and a means for visual feedback training of pharyngeal and laryngeal musculature. The protocol is reviewed here. Case reports illustrating the clinical usefulness of VEED as an adjunct to the modified barium swallow are also presented, and the relative strengths and weaknesses of VEED and the modified barium swallow are compared. 
Which pH threshold is best in esophageal pH monitoring? Two questions were examined, namely, 1) whether pH 4 is really the optimal threshold for the definition of acid gastroesophageal reflux, and 2) to what extent shifting of the upper limits of normal affects sensitivity and specificity of 24-h pH monitoring. To answer these questions, we studied 74 patients with proven reflux disease and 37 asymptomatic volunteers, using ambulatory 24-h esophageal pH monitoring. Gastroesophageal reflux was defined as episodes with esophageal pH of less than the threshold values 3.0, 3.5, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0, respectively. For each of these pH thresholds, the percentage time with esophageal pH below the threshold was calculated separately for periods of upright and supine body position. Two-dimensional receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to define upper limits of normal. A maximum of sensitivity, specificity, and rate of correct decisions (all 89%) was obtained using pH 4 for the definition of gastroesophageal reflux, although other pH thresholds were not much worse. On the basis of pH 4, the upper limits of normal could be shifted around the "optimal upper limit of normal" within a certain limit without considerable loss of accuracy of pH monitoring. This may explain the divergences between upper limits of normal obtained by different laboratories. In conclusion, 1) the threshold pH 4 should further be used for the definition of acid gastroesophageal reflux, and, 2) within certain limits, shifting of the upper limits of normal has little effect on the accuracy of pH monitoring in gastroesophageal reflux disease. 
Genetic control of susceptibility to diethylnitrosamine and dimethylbenzanthracene carcinogenesis in rats. The susceptibility to cancer induction after a single dose of diethylnitrosamine in male rats and a single dose of dimethylbenzanthracene in female rats was examined in the grc- strain R16 and the grc+ strain ACP, both of which have the same major histocompatibility complex genes but differ in the grc region. No tumor-promoting regimens were used, and the animals were fed only laboratory chou. The R16 males developed liver cancer and the R16 females developed breast cancer, there also were malignancies in other organs in some animals. By contrast, the ACP males did not develop any malignancies, and the ACP females had a significantly lower prevalence of malignant tumors. Thus the susceptibility to cancer in these two strains of rats has a genetic basis associated with genes in the grc region, and is independent of the carcinogen used, the action of a promoter, and the sex of the animals. 
Deletion of the entire cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 gene as a cause of impaired drug metabolism in poor metabolizers of the debrisoquine/sparteine polymorphism. The debrisoquine/sparteine polymorphism is associated with a clinically important genetic deficiency of oxidative drug metabolism. From 5% to 10% of Caucasians designated as poor metabolizers (PMs) of the debrisoquine/sparteine polymorphism have a severely impaired capacity to metabolize more than 25 therapeutically used drugs. The impaired drug metabolism in PMs is due to the absence of cytochrome P450IID6 protein. The gene controlling the P450IID6 protein, CYP2D6, is located on the long arm of chromosome 22. A pseudogene CYP2D8P and a related gene CYP2D7 are located upstream from CYP2D6. This gene locus is highly polymorphic. After digestion of genomic DNA with XbaI endonuclease, restriction fragments of 11.5 kb and 44 kb represent mutant alleles of the cytochrome CYP2D6 gene locus associated with the PM phenotype. In order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the mutant allele reflected by the XbaI 11.5-kb fragment, a genomic library was constructed from leukocyte DNA of one individual homozygous for this fragment and screened with the human IID6 cDNA. The CYP2D genes were isolated and characterized by restriction mapping and partial sequencing. We demonstrate that the mutant 11.5-kb allele results from a deletion involving the entire functional CYP2D6 gene. This result provides an explanation for the total absence of P450IID6 protein in the liver of these PMs. 
Subclinical peripheral nerve involvement in AIDS: an electrophysiological and pathological study. Thirty patients with AIDS without symptoms or signs of peripheral neuropathy were compared electrophysiologically with 23 age and sex matched healthy controls. The patients had a mean reduction in the amplitude of common peroneal compound muscle action potentials of 37% (95% CI 11-70%) and of sural sensory action potentials of 34% (CI 18-49%). Mean conduction velocity of both motor and sensory nerves was reduced by between 1 and 7 m/s, with a prolongation of F waves corrected for height of 5% in the arms and 13% in the legs. The distal motor latencies were unchanged. These changes did not correlate with the duration of AIDS, degree of immunosuppression (CD4 count), Body Mass Index, albumin or vitamin B12 level. Four patients had subclinical mononeuropathies. Sural nerve taken at necropsy from five asymptomatic AIDS patients had evidence of axonal degeneration without inflammation or demyelination. There was a mean reduction in myelinated fibre density of 30.5% (CI 10-51%) compared with eight age matched sudden death controls (p = 0.01). This loss principally affected the larger fibres. The pathological and electrophysiological changes indicate axonal degeneration and are similar to those seen in other chronic disorders and in normal ageing. It is concluded that this axonal degeneration is not specific to HIV. 
Primary progressive aphasia with focal neuronal achromasia. We describe the clinical, radiologic, neuropsychological, and neuropathologic features of a 69-year-old man with a 3-year history of progressive transcortical expressive aphasia. Neuropsychological testing showed progressive dysfunction of expressive language. Neuropathologic examination demonstrated focal cortical degeneration involving the left superior frontal gyrus, with swollen achromasic neurons and no evidence of Alzheimer's disease, Pick's disease, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Lewybody disease, or other dementing disorders. This case adds to the known heterogeneity of the underlying pathology of patients with primary progressive aphasia. 
Pericardial cyst with partial erosion of the right ventricular wall. A case of pericardial cyst with partial erosion into the anterior wall of the right ventricle is presented. Cardiopulmonary bypass was necessary for excision of the cyst. This report helps to alert surgeons of the possible need for cardiopulmonary bypass during the removal of some pericardial cysts, especially in patients with signs and symptoms of infection and in whom preoperative imaging fails to show distinct margins between the cyst and cardiac structures. 
Splenosis: an unusual cause of intraabdominal hemorrhage. A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe abdominal pain. She developed hypovolemic shock from an intra-abdominal bleed. At laparotomy she was found to be bleeding from two areas of splenosis on the uterine ligament. The patient had sustained a ruptured spleen 22 years prior and had no symptomatology from her areas of splenosis. A short review of splenosis is presented. 
Alterations in influence of granuloma-derived cytokines on fibrogenesis in the course of murine Schistosoma mansoni infection. Schistosomiasis is the main cause of hepatic fibrosis worldwide, yet its pathogenesis remains unknown. We previously reported that conditioned medium from cultures of hepatic egg granulomas (isolated from mice acutely infected with Schistosoma mansoni) can stimulate fibroblast proliferation and matrix production in vitro. We have proposed that initiation of hepatic fibrosis in this infection might be under the control of granuloma-derived cytokines. We now report that conditioned medium from cultures of schistosomal egg granulomas isolated from liver of chronically infected mice has reduced fibrogenic activity compared with medium from cultures of granulomas obtained from more acutely infected mice. In related studies, we adoptively transferred splenocytes from infected mice and examined the fibrogenic activity in culture supernatants of hepatic egg granulomas isolated from the recipients. Those prepared from recipients of splenocytes from chronically infected mice contained substantially less fibrogenic activity than did those from recipients of splenocytes of acutely infected mice. These findings suggest that the fibrogenic influence of schistosomal egg granuloma products decreases during the course of chronic murine S. mansoni infection. Furthermore, our preliminary findings suggest that immunoregulatory cells may be responsible for the down-regulation of this influence. Previous observations indicating that in murine schistosomiasis hepatic collagen and hyaluronate synthesis and deposition are elevated in acute but not chronic infection might be explained on the basis of our observations. 
Genomic structure of the human prion protein gene. Creutzfeld-Jacob disease and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome are rare degenerative disorders of the nervous system which have been genetically linked to the prion protein (PrP) gene. The PrP gene encodes a host glycoprotein of unknown function and is located on the short arm of chromosome 20, a region with few known genes or anonymous markers. The complete structure of the PrP gene in man has not been determined despite considerable interest in its relationship to these unusual disorders. We have determined that the human PrP gene has the same simple genomic structure seen in the hamster gene and consists of two exons and a single intron. In contrast to the hamster PrP gene the human gene appears to have a single major transcriptional start site. The region immediately 5' of the transcriptional start site of the human PrP gene demonstrates the GC-rich features commonly seen in housekeeping genes. Curiously, the genomic clone we have isolated contains a 24-bp deletion that removes one of five octameric peptide repeats predicted to form a B-pleated sheet in this region of the PrP. We have also identified 5' of the PrP gene an RFLP which has a high degree of heterozygosity and which should serve as a useful marker for the pter-12 region of human chromosome 20. 
Primary mucoid adenocarcinoma of the larynx. Mucous glands carcinomas of the larynx are rare, with most being represented by 'non-specific' adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma. Here we report a unique case of mucoid adenocarcinoma of the larynx occurring in a 46-year-old woman. Despite the presence of regional lymph node metastasis, she remained well four years after surgery. 
Platelet activating factor-induced shock and intestinal necrosis in the rat: role of endogenous platelet-activating factor and effect of saline infusion. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The mechanism of ischemic bowel necrosis induced by platelet-activating factor is unclear. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after platelet-activating factor injection, we hypothesized that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. The present study investigated the effects of saline infusion on platelet activating factor-induced bowel necrosis and its mechanism. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into four groups: group A consisted of sham-operated rats; group B received platelet-activating factor (1.5 micrograms/kg iv); group C received platelet-activating factor and saline (0.097 mL/min iv); group D received platelet-activating factor and WEB 2086 (platelet-activating factor antagonist). RESULTS: Saline infusion largely reversed platelet activating factor-induced hypotension, hemoconcentration, and reduction of the superior mesenteric arterial blood flow. Saline infusion also ameliorated platelet activating factor-induced bowel injury, although a mild-to-moderate degree of necrosis still developed focally. In addition, saline prevented the platelet activating factor-induced increase in intestinal platelet-activating factor production. Saline also prevented the increase in intestine leukocyte number, as estimated by myeloperoxidase activity. CONCLUSIONS: Saline infusion is an effective treatment for platelet activating factor-induced shock and intestinal necrosis. However, focal bowel injury is still observed, suggesting that other factors besides hemodynamic changes contribute to the development of tissue injury. We also showed that, in vivo, platelet-activating factor stimulates its own synthesis via a positive feedback loop, which could be blocked by intravascular volume expansion with saline. 
Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil with and without doxorubicin in the adjuvant treatment of resectable breast cancer with one to three positive axillary nodes. In the attempt to improve current adjuvant results in patients with one to three positive axillary lymph nodes, in November 1981 we activated a prospective randomized study to assess the effectiveness of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) for 12 courses versus CMF for eight courses followed by Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milan, Italy) for four courses. The 5-year results were evaluated in a total of 486 patients entered into the study up to December 1987. CMF chemotherapy was delivered IV for a total of 12 courses when given alone and for eight courses when followed by four courses of Adriamycin. All drugs were recycled every 3 weeks. Rather than temporarily reducing doses, drug administration was delayed for 1 to 2 weeks in the face of myelosuppression on the planned day of treatment. After a median follow-up of 61 months, no significant differences were evident between the treatment groups in terms of relapse-free (CMF 74% v CMF followed by Adriamycin 72%) and total survival (CMF 89% v CMF followed by Adriamycin 86%). Drug treatments were fairly well tolerated and devoid of life-threatening toxicity. Present results, which were not influenced by menopausal status, indicate that Adriamycin given after CMF failed to improve treatment outcome over CMF alone. However, the role of Adriamycin in an adjuvant setting remains to be further clarified. Considering the good 5-year results achieved in this study at the expense of minimal toxicity, full-dose CMF remains, at present, the adjuvant chemotherapy of choice for patients with one to three positive nodes. 
Neuroleptic drug use in the nursing home: the impact of OBRA. In 1990 the new OBRA legislation affecting nursing home care went into effect. This legislation and the regulations written to interpret it introduce specific rules concerning the use of neuroleptic medication in the care of nursing home residents. This article examines this legislation and the new regulations, and reviews neuroleptic drug use, including appropriate indications, side effects and prescribing guidelines. Physicians who care for nursing home patients should be familiar with the regulations. 
U74006F, a novel 21-aminosteroid, inhibits in vivo lipid peroxidation but fails to limit infarct size in a canine model of myocardial ischemia reperfusion. Peroxidation of membrane lipids has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury. We therefore assessed the efficacy of U74006F, a potent in vitro vitamin E-like inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, in limiting infarct size in a canine model of transient coronary artery occlusion. Twenty dogs underwent 2 hours of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 6 hours of reperfusion. U74006F or saline solution was administered continuously from 1 hour of occlusion to the end of the experiment. U74006F blunted any increase in production of conjugated dienes (an index of lipid peroxidation) at both 30 minutes (1.73 +/- 0.16 mol/L x 10(-4) vs 2.62 +/- 0.22 in control dogs, p less than 0.05) and 6 hours (1.39 +/- 0.22 vs 2.06 +/- 0.18 in control dogs, p less than 0.05) after reperfusion. Furthermore, 6 hours after reflow vitamin E levels tended to be lower than baseline values in control dogs and higher than baseline values in dogs treated with U74006F. However, analysis of infarct size indicated no statistically significant difference between the two groups when expressed either as a percentage of the left ventricle (10.4 +/- 1.8% in U74006F vs 15.2 +/- 2.4% in control dogs) or as a percentage of the area at risk (33.0 +/- 5.5% in U74006F vs 37.8 +/- 4.5% in control dogs). Although U74006F appeared to be a potent in vivo inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, it failed to limit infarct size after 2 hours of occlusion and 6 hours of reperfusion in this canine model. 
Factors associated with poor visual outcome in acute retinal necrosis. We reviewed 22 consecutive patients (26 eyes) with acute retinal necrosis to elucidate whether there was any sign at an early stage to predict poor visual outcome. Final visual acuity of the patients fell into two groups, one worse than 20/600 (15 eyes) and the other better than 20/30 (11 eyes). The patients with poor visual outcome showed diffuse retinal arteritis or arterial obliteration which was associated with reduced amplitude of electroretinographic a and b waves and elevated levels of circulating immune complex, even at an early stage when retinal exudates were still localised to the peripheral fundus. The retinal exudates in these patients extended rapidly to the posterior pole. In contrast, the patients with good visual outcome showed retinal arteritis limited within retinal exudates throughout the course. These signs at an early stage can be used as prognostic factors to manage patients with acute retinal necrosis more constructively. 
Permissivity of primary cultures of human Kupffer cells for HIV-1. Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) represent the largest reservoir of fixed macrophages in the body. Accordingly, we have undertaken a study to evaluate their susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Five-day-old primary cultures of Kupffer cells (KC) were infected with HIV-1, and as the infection progressed, syncytia appeared. Within the cells, viral proteins were detected by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies directed against gp120 and p24. Electron microscopic examinations revealed the presence of typical Lentivirinae particles. The particles released from KC in the extracellular medium showed reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen; they could infect lymphocytic cells and were neutralized by a HIV+ patient's serum or an anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody. Our results thus demonstrate that the interaction of HIV-1 with KC in vitro leads to a productive infection. They suggest that the KC may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and may (i) participate in the transmission of the infection to the peripheral blood cells, (ii) play a role in the depletion of uninfected CD4+ cells. 
Envenomation by the puss caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis). We discuss the case of a 52-year-old woman who developed urticarial lesions after the acute envenomation of a puss caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis). The puss caterpillar, one of more than 50 species of caterpillars that can cause envenomation in the United States, is considered to be one of the most serious. Its clinical presentation and current recommended treatments are reviewed. 
Human atrial natriuretic factor and renin-aldosterone in paracetamol induced fulminant hepatic failure. It has been postulated that deficiency of a putative natriuretic factor, or resistance to such a factor, may contribute to sodium retention in fulminant hepatic failure. Levels of plasma human atrial natriuretic factor (h-ANF), plasma renin activity, and aldosterone concentration were measured in 33 patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to paracetamol overdose, and 12 healthy control subjects. Levels of h-ANF were raised only in patients with evidence of severe renal impairment (serum creatinine greater than 300 mumol/l and urine output less than 100 ml/24 hours). h-ANF values were median 4.15, range 2-9 pmol/l and 10.1, 1-25 pmol/l for the control and severe renal impairment groups respectively (p less than 0.001). In the latter plasma renin activity was raised compared to that in control subjects (median 19.8, range 1.04-41.7 and 2.86, 1.87-5.9 pmol/l/h respectively, p less than 0.02). Plasma aldosterone concentration was also raised in patients (2176, 199-6894 pmol/l compared to 368, 133-578 pmol/l in control subjects, p less than 0.01). Haemodialysis induced changes in circulating h-ANF which correlated with volume and right atrial pressure changes (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.05 respectively). In six patients with no or mild renal failure infusion of 900 ml 5% human albumin solution caused a significant increase in plasma h-ANF (p less than 0.05) without natriuresis or diuresis, a finding compatible with the hypothesis that there may be resistance to h-ANF in this group. The present findings indicate that there is no deficiency of h-ANF in fulminant hepatic failure and that known mechanisms of h-ANF release are not impaired. 
Endoscopic retrograde hemorrhoidal sclerotherapy using 23.4% saline: a preliminary report. Historically, injection sclerotherapy has had a prominent role in the treatment of symptomatic hemorrhoids. Concern over sclerosant-related morbidity and dissatisfaction with anoscopic injection techniques has limited the application of this modality in the United States. This study reports an initial evaluation of 23.4% saline, used as a nonallergenic sclerosant, in the flexible endoscopic treatment of symptomatic internal hemorrhoids. Initial results in 19 patients with symptomatic grade I, II, or III hemorrhoids suggest that the technique is very effective in relieving bleeding, and frequently alleviates prolapse as well. The technique has proven to be well tolerated and associated with high patient satisfaction and low complication rates, with no serious complications noted. This modality is eminently suited for single session examination and therapy of the patient undergoing endoscopic evaluation for lower gastrointestinal bleeding whose findings are limited to hemorrhoidal disease. 
Oral contraceptives and breast cancer. Cause and effect? Case-control studies dealing with breast cancer and oral contraceptives (OCs) were reviewed against a background of currently accepted rules for conducting and interpreting epidemiologic research. There is a strong consensus that OCs have not increased the risk of breast cancer in women over age 45, even when they have been used for long periods. The controversy is confined to studies of cancer diagnosed in young women. Although an effect of duration of OC use has been observed in some studies, there is neither a latency period nor an effect from recent or current use. There is no obvious relationship to the type of pill and no consistent effect of the dose of estrogen. The effect, if it exists at all, is not confined to any specific subgroup; it has not been related to age at starting OCs. It has been observed in only a few studies, some of which were subsequently discounted. Others have shown no effect or have suggested a reduced risk of breast cancer with increasing duration of use. None of the studies purporting to show an effect of OCs have controlled for the potential confounding effects of duration of lactation, induced abortion, recent pregnancy or a history of diseases that are associated both with reduced use of OCs and reduced risk of breast cancer. Most have inappropriately controlled for benign breast disease. There is an urgent need for a reanalysis of existing studies to take these factors into account. The lack of consistency and the potential for bias and confounding argue strongly against concluding, at this time, that there is a causal relationship between OCs and breast cancer. 
Prophylactic sclerotherapy for esophageal varices in men with alcoholic liver disease. A randomized, single-blind, multicenter clinical trial. The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Variceal Sclerotherapy Group. BACKGROUND. Sclerotherapy is an effective treatment for bleeding esophageal varices in patients with alcoholic liver disease. It has also been suggested that sclerotherapy might be effective in preventing initial episodes of bleeding and improving survival among such patients. METHODS. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial comparing prophylactic sclerotherapy and sham therapy in 281 men with alcoholic liver disease who had at least three variceal channels and no history of variceal bleeding. All the patients underwent endoscopy; 143 received sclerotherapy, and 138 received sham therapy. RESULTS. The two patient groups were well matched at entry with respect to the extent of liver disease and other clinical indexes, except that other medical illnesses were significantly more common in the sclerotherapy group. The study's data-monitoring board terminated the trial 22.5 months after it began because the rate of mortality from all causes was significantly higher in the sclerotherapy group (32.2 percent) than in the sham-therapy group (17.4 percent, P = 0.004), despite the fact that the men who received sclerotherapy had significantly fewer episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding. The causes of death varied, and there is no obvious explanation for the excess mortality in the sclerotherapy group. After the termination of treatment, the excess mortality rate in the sclerotherapy group promptly declined. There were 53 episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (including 10 from esophageal varices and 9 from esophageal ulcers) in the sclerotherapy group and 40 episodes (including 19 from esophageal varices) in the sham-therapy group. Complications of sclerotherapy were frequent but seldom life-threatening. CONCLUSIONS. For unknown reasons, prophylactic sclerotherapy is associated with increased mortality among men with moderate-to-severe alcoholic liver disease and esophageal varices. Sclerotherapy should not be performed until after an initial episode of bleeding from esophageal varices has occurred. 
Increased treatment of hypertension does not explain the decline in stroke mortality in the United States, 1970-1980. The steady decline in mortality from stroke in the United States accelerated markedly in the 1970s. It has been widely assumed that an increase in the rate of treatment of hypertension is the most likely explanation for this major public health achievement. An analysis of available information, however, suggests that improvements in the community control of hypertension in the United States in the period 1970-1980 have contributed in only a minor way. There were 45,357 fewer deaths from stroke in 1980 among those aged 35-74 years than might have been expected if the death rates had stayed the same as in 1970. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Surveys indicate that six million more people received antihypertensive medication in 1980 than in 1970. Results from a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials of the treatment of hypertension suggest that between 6% and 16% of the reduction in stroke mortality was due to the increased treatment of hypertension. Epidemiological observations indicate that between 16% and 25% of the overall decline in stroke mortality can be attributed to the treatment of hypertension, suggesting that clinical trials probably underestimate the community-wide benefits of treatment. These results also suggest that at least three quarters of the decline in stroke mortality in the United States in the period 1970-1980 is due to factors other than antihypertensive treatment. 
Adjuvant intraperitoneal chromic phosphate therapy for women with apparent early ovarian carcinoma who have not undergone comprehensive surgical staging. Forty-nine women with apparent Stage I and II ovarian carcinoma received intraperitoneal phosphate 32 as the only adjuvant therapy after primary surgery. In addition to bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 40 (82%) had analysis of peritoneal cytology, and 35 (71%) underwent omentectomy. Random peritoneal biopsies and retroperitoneal lymph node sampling were not done in any of these patients. The overall and disease-free survival rates were 86% and 75%, respectively, with no significant differences by stage, histologic grade, histologic type, or low-risk versus high-risk subsets recognized in patients who received comprehensive surgical staging. Seven (58%) of 12 patients had lymph node metastasis as the first site of recurrence, including two of three with late recurrences. Significant morbidity related to intraperitoneal chromic phosphate (32P) occurred in one (2%) woman. These results emphasize the need for comprehensive surgical staging of women with apparent early ovarian carcinoma to aid in the selection of appropriate initial adjuvant therapy. 
An analysis of lymphocyte 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine binding in neurological patients. Evidence of altered binding in Alzheimer's disease. Muscarinic cholinergic receptors were analysed in lymphocyte membranes from 35 patients with early (n = 20) and late onset (n = 15) Alzheimer's disease (AD), 86 patients with other neurological disorders and 60 normal controls by the specific binding of 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine (3H-NMS). The number of binding sites of 3H-NMS (Bmax) was significantly decreased both in early and late onset AD groups as compared with age-matched controls, by 54% and 40%, respectively, whereas the apparent binding affinity (Kd) was the same in all disease and control groups. In addition, the average Bmax in early AD was significantly lower than in late AD. The density of the binding of 3H-NMS was also significantly lower in a subgroup of old subjects with Down's syndrome (DS), whereas no changes were found in younger individuals with DS or in patients with Parkinson's disease, whether they were demented or not, multi-infarct dementia, myasthenia gravis or epilepsy. In the AD group, the difference in binding sites was unrelated either to the severity of dementia or disease duration. Treatment of the patients with cholinergic agents did not alter the binding values in any of the examined group. We conclude that the alteration of lymphocyte muscarinic receptors is highly associated with AD, but whether this reflects the central cholinergic deficit in these patients is uncertain. 
Evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries: correlation of magnetic resonance angiography, duplex ultrasonography, and conventional angiography. We compared duplex scanning, "bright blood" and "black blood" magnetic resonance angiography, and conventional angiography for evaluation of the extracranial carotid arteries. All three methods were applied to 39 vessels in 20 patients. Duplex scanning was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in six instances. In three instances the degree of stenosis was overgraded by the scanner, and in three cases the stenosis was undergraded. Magnetic resonance angiography was inaccurate when compared to conventional angiography in three instances. In all cases magnetic resonance angiography overgraded the degree of stenosis. By use of a greater than 70% stenosis as a positive study, the sensitivity of magnetic resonance angiography was 100% and the specificity 92%. With use of the same criteria, the sensitivity of duplex scanning was 86%, and specificity was 84%. In those evaluations where the results of the magnetic resonance angiography and duplex scanning were in agreement, the correlation with conventional angiography was 100%. We conclude that magnetic resonance angiography is an alternative means to duplex scanning for noninvasive carotid imaging. A combination of bright and black blood magnetic resonance angiography is precise in delineating lesions of the extracranial carotid artery and may ultimately eliminate the need for conventional angiography in the evaluation of carotid stenosis. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to superior mesenteric artery to duodenum fistula: rare complication of metastatic lung carcinoma. Although metastases from primary carcinoma of the lung to the small intestine appear to be more common than previously suspected, they rarely produce symptoms. Such metastases may present as bowel perforations. Overt gastrointestinal bleeding has been described only as a prelude to perforation. We describe the case of a 55-yr-old man with carcinoma of the lung that had metastasized to the brain and to the third part of the duodenum. The duodenal metastasis presented with massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The metastasis was seen to be actively bleeding at endoscopy, and a direct fistula from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery to the third part of the duodenum was shown angiographically. Arterial invasion and destruction by tumor was confirmed at postmortem examination. This complication of metastatic carcinoma of the lung has not been previously described in the English literature. 
Increased plasma levels and blunted effects of brain natriuretic peptide in rats with congestive heart failure. The hemodynamic and renal effects of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) were studied in conscious rats with experimental congestive heart failure (CHF) produced by an aortocaval fistula. The peptide had potent hypotensive, diuretic, and natriuretic effects in control rats, all of which were abolished in CHF. Plasma levels of BNP increased time-dependently during the development of CHF, and were more than four-fold higher in sodium retaining rats than in control rats. The data suggest that BNP secretion from the atria is increased in CHF, and that resistance to BNP, in addition to the relative resistance to atrial natriuretic factor, may contribute to sodium retention in CHF. 
Selective antibiotic prophylaxis in biliary tract operations. A prospective study of 397 patients with primary biliary operations performed for benign disease included a perioperative culture of the bile. Two main groups of patients in whom bacteria in the bile and, thus, probably increased risk postoperative infection was common, are patients undergoing emergency operation (60 per cent bacteria in the bile, as compared with 22 per cent in those with elective operations) and patients with a history of acute cholecystitis or pancreatitis, or both, or jaundice (49 per cent bacteria in the bile with a positive history as compared with 11 per cent without). The rate of infection was 2.8 per cent in high-risk groups, as compared with 0.6 per cent in patients undergoing elective operative procedures with no history of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or jaundice. Thus, antibiotics can probably be reserved for those patients who had emergency surgical treatment and for those with elective operations and a history of acute cholecystitis, pancreatitis or jaundice. In addition, antibiotic prophylaxis might be indicated for all patients who are 75 years of age or older, as bacteria in the bile seems to be common in this age group even without a history of the aforementioned complications. 
Effects of long-term enalapril therapy on cardiopulmonary exercise performance after myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. The Enalapril Postinfarction Exercise (EPIE) trial was designed to study the effect of enalapril treatment on peak and submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise performance over the course of 1 year in men after myocardial infarction with mild exercise intolerance. METHODS AND RESULTS. One hundred sixty men with a peak VO2 less than 25 ml/kg/min and without effort angina were randomized to receive enalapril 20 mg qd or placebo on a double-blind basis. The mean age was 60.3 +/- 7.6 years. All patients received concurrent beta-blocker therapy for secondary prophylaxis. Treatment began at 21 days (group 1, n = 100) or more than 6 months after infarction (group 2, n = 60). Patients underwent exercise with real-time gas-exchange analysis nine times over the course of 48 weeks. In group 1, improvement in exercise performance occurred during the course of the trial in both groups of patients receiving placebo or enalapril. The mean peak VO2 for the placebo-treated patients in group 1 increased from 18.3 +/- 3.4 ml/kg/min by 4.9% at 48 weeks (p less than 0.05). The corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 18.9 +/- 3.8 ml/kg/min with a 3.7% increase (p = 0.07). Total exercise time increased in the placebo-treated patients from 645 +/- 96 seconds by 7.3% (p less than 0.01). Corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 674 +/- 103 seconds with a 5.4% increase (p less than 0.01). In group 2, the mean peak VO2 at baseline for the placebo-treated patients of 20.3 +/- 3.8 ml/kg/min increased by 4.4% at 48 weeks (p = NS). The corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 19.2 +/- 3.6 ml/kg/min with a 2.6% increase (p = NS). Total exercise time increased in the placebo-treated patients from 677 +/- 114 seconds by 0.7% (p = NS). Corresponding values for enalapril-treated patients were 659 +/- 99 seconds with a 1.1% increase (p = NS). There were no significant differences between the placebo and enalapril subgroups at any time with regard to peak VO2, exercise duration, or the VO2 at the anaerobic threshold. CONCLUSIONS. This trial demonstrates that long-term converting enzyme inhibition with enalapril had no significant effect on the peak or submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise performance over the course of 1 year in men after myocardial infarction with only mildly reduced exercise capacity. 
Spraying of aerosolized fibrin glue in the treatment of nonsuturable hemorrhage. In the present report, the authors describe the use of aerosolized fibrin glue (FG) to achieve hemostasis in patients with nonsuturable hemorrhage. The multicomponent FG was sprayed on bleeding tissues with a dual chamber spray head that allowed simultaneous application and mixing of fibrinogen and thrombin on the tissue surface. Sterile propellant gas was passed through tubing to the spray head and independently controlled, allowing for drying of the tissue surface immediately before FG application. This technique was found to be effective in achieving hemostasis of parenchymal organs, retroperitoneal surfaces, and skin graft donor sites. Additional potential applications of this technique include the control of hemorrhage from mediastinal and pleural surfaces. 
Randomized comparative trial of indomethacin and ritodrine for the long-term treatment of preterm labor. A randomized prospective trial was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of ritodrine and indomethacin in the long-term treatment of preterm labor. Forty patients with intact membranes in preterm labor at 23 to 34 weeks' gestation were randomized to receive either intravenous ritodrine or oral indomethacin as the first-line tocolytic agent. Successful intravenous ritodrine therapy was followed by oral terbutaline therapy, and indomethacin-treated patients continued to receive oral indomethacin. Treatment failures were defined as progressive preterm labor or patient intolerance, and these patients were treated with intravenous magnesium sulfate. Ritodrine and indomethacin were equally successful in delaying preterm birth as defined by interval to delivery, gestational age at delivery, delivery delayed greater than 7 days, attainment of 35 weeks of gestation, percentage of patients who required magnesium sulfate therapy, percentage of patients who were readmitted with premature rupture of membranes, absence of recurrent preterm labor, and infant birth weight. More than 80% of mothers who received ritodrine voiced complaints of beta-sympathomimetic side effects, and one patient discontinued treatment as the result of intolerance. There were minimal patient complaints with indomethacin use. No statistically significant differences were noted in neonatal outcome as defined by Apgar scores, umbilical cord pH, intensive care days, ventilator days, or neonatal deaths. However, three cases of primary pulmonary hypertension were observed in the indomethacin group. We had not previously observed this problem with short-term (24 to 48 hours) indomethacin therapy. 
Treatment for acute myelocytic leukemia with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation following preparation with BuCy2. One hundred twenty-seven patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) were given busulfan 4 mg/kg on each of 4 days and cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg on each of 2 days (BuCy2) followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical or one antigen disparate sibling. For 71 patients in first complete remission, 23 in second complete remission or initial relapse, and 33 patients with primary refractory disease, second or subsequent relapse, or a preceding hematologic disorder, the 3-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) is 63.1%, 32.6%, and 24.2% respectively. The actuarial probability of relapse for each group is 14.1%, 40.6%, and 61.0%. In multivariate analyses, relapse and decreased LFS were associated with advanced disease phase and with M4/M5 French-American-British classification. The LFS of first remission patients was adversely associated with a short time interval from diagnosis to transplantation. This study indicates that BuCy2 is an attractive preparative regimen for marrow transplantation in patients with AML and that prognostic factors for relapse and LFS are similar those described for regimens containing total body irradiation. 
Oxygen-induced hypercarbia in obstructive pulmonary disease. We investigated the mechanisms responsible for oxygen-induced hypercarbia in ventilator-dependent patients with advanced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To quantitate the effects of oxygen (O2) on respiratory drive, we determined the CO2 recruitment threshold (PCO2 RT) in 10 mechanically ventilated patients under normoxic (PaO2 = 67 +/- 7 mm Hg) and hyperoxic (PaO2 = 370 +/- 67 mm Hg) conditions. PCO2 RT is a measure of the CO2 responsiveness of the mechanically unloaded respiratory system and, as such, is independent of mechanical impedance and respiratory muscle strength. After O2 supplementation, PCO2 RT increased from 42 +/- 6 to 45 +/- 6 mm Hg (p less than or equal to 0.05), indicating a suppression of so-called hypoxic respiratory drive. The effect of hyperoxia on the dead space to tidal volume ratio (VD/VT) and CO2 elimination (VCO2) was studied in 6 patients. Measurements were made at identical ventilator settings, thus eliminating breathing pattern- and respiratory work-related effects on these variables. VD/VT rose from 0.49 +/- 0.09 to 0.55 +/- 0.06 (p less than or equal to 0.05), but VCO2 remained constant at 0.21 L/min. We discuss why measuring O2-induced changes in minute ventilation, VCO2, PaO2, and VD/VT in spontaneously breathing patients is insufficient to distinguish between gas exchange- and respiratory drive-related mechanisms for hypercarbia. Based on the O2-induced increase in PCO2 RT, we conclude that so-called suppression of hypoxic drive plays an important role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. 
Spontaneous favorable outcome of tracheal laceration. We present the case of a 57-year-old woman with a huge tracheal laceration after intubation. With simple supportive therapy, the laceration healed in ten days, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. At the three-month follow-up, no sequelae were observed. 
Study of belching ability in antireflux surgery patients and normal volunteers. The ability to belch was evaluated by a novel test, after gaseous stomach distension to standard volume, in 16 patients after antireflux surgery and nine healthy volunteers. A structured assessment of dyspeptic symptoms was also carried out in both groups. Repeat studies in volunteers showed acceptable reproducibility for the new test of belching capacity (within-subject coefficient of variance 4.5 per cent). After antireflux surgery, patients had lower volume individual belches (median(range) 27.5(0-104) ml in patients versus 76(15-165) ml in volunteers; P less than 0.02) and belched less gas within 1 h of the stimulus than volunteers (median(range) 205(0-1363) ml in patients versus 456(45-818) ml in volunteers; P less than 0.05). Belching frequency was similar in both groups. The incidence and severity of symptoms were unrelated to belched gas volumes. 
Population-based study of surgery in juvenile onset ulcerative colitis. A geographically based cohort of 37 children with ulcerative colitis has been derived by sampling from Scottish Hospital In-patient Statistics. Surgical histories were examined and analysed by actuarial methods, and the major operations performed were compared with operations for ulcerative colitis in the Lothians' Surgical Audit. Fourteen of the 37 patients had a total of 26 operations (15 major, 11 minor). Sixteen per cent had major surgery within 5 years of onset of symptoms, and the types of operation were similar to those recorded in Lothians' Surgical Audit. Operation rate was significantly lower than that for a parallel cohort of patients with Crohn's disease. With a mean follow-up of 7.4 years, seven (19 per cent) patients have a permanent stoma and there has been one death. 
Intraoperative defect in haemostasis in a child receiving valproic acid. This report describes the development of an intraoperative defect in haemostasis which occurred during surgery for lengthening of the heel cords and release of hip contractures in a patient receiving valproic acid. A review of the literature failed to find any other cases of a valproic acid-induced bleeding disorder occurring under anaesthesia and surgery. While recognized in the non-surgical literature, this case reports the first in which the development of a valproic acid-induced haemostatic defect occurred under anaesthesia. The subsequent course is discussed and some pathophysiological mechanisms are presented. It is suggested that for patients receiving valproic acid preoperative education should include PT/PTT, platelet and fibrinogen counts and bleeding time so that abnormal coagulation states can be recognized. 
Adamantinoma of the tibia with pulmonary metastases and hypercalcemia. Adamantinomas of long bones are rare primary malignant bone tumors. A case of a woman who died of pulmonary metastases of an adamantinoma of the tibia is presented. A unique feature of this case is the association with hypercalcemia. The association of hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, decreased parathyroid hormone levels and increased urinary cAMP excretion suggests a humorally mediated hypercalcemia. Histologic and ultrastructural analysis of the pulmonary metastases demonstrated that the tumor was composed of a heterogeneous cell population with mesenchymal and epithelial differentiation. 
Effect of hyaluronic acid on postoperative intraperitoneal adhesion formation in the rat model. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of hyaluronic acid solution in preventing intraperitoneal (IP) adhesions. DESIGN AND SETTING: The study design was prospective, randomized and blinded and involved 83 rats. INTERVENTIONS: Measured serosal injury was inflicted using a CO2 laser on the right uterine horn of the rat. Animals randomized to groups 1 and 2 received either 0.4% hyaluronic acid or its diluent phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) intraperitoneally before and after the injury. In groups 3 and 4, the same solutions were used only after the injury. Postoperative adhesions were assessed at second-look laparotomy. Histologic assessment of the fresh laser injury was carried out on uteri pretreated with hyaluronic acid, PBS, or nothing. MAIN OUTCOME: Pretreatment with hyaluronic acid was associated with a significant reduction in postoperative adhesions and a significantly decreased crater depth. CONCLUSIONS: Hyaluronic acid appears to reduce postoperative IP adhesion formation by coating the serosal surfaces and decreasing the extent of initial tissue injury. 
Conjugated estrogens reduce endothelial prostacyclin production and fail to reduce postbypass blood loss. Intravenous conjugated estrogens correct bleeding times and reduce bleeding in uremia, gastrointestinal telangiectasias, and liver disease. One study found a similar benefit in patients undergoing open heart surgery. The mechanism by which conjugated estrogens improve bleeding times is unknown. We report on the effect of estrogens on endothelial prostacyclin production and bleeding in coronary bypass surgery. In a randomized, double-blind trial, 16 male patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery received four daily infusions of conjugated estrogens (0.6 mg/kg/day) or placebo, preoperatively. Groups were similar with respect to age, preoperative hemostatic profiles, and pump time. Conjugated estrogens significantly reduced greater saphenous vein endothelial prostacyclin production in the estrogen group compared to control subjects. Postoperative blood loss was not reduced, with a trend toward increased blood loss in the treatment group. We have shown that conjugated estrogens reduce endothelial prostacyclin production and fail to reduce blood loss in coronary bypass surgery. 
New visits for abdominal pain in the primary care setting. Abdominal pain is a common problem in primary care. Previous studies of this problem are limited by either the age group examined or the clinical setting. Findings of the 1980 and 1981 National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys were combined to assess new visits for abdominal pain. A visit to a physician was considered to be for new abdominal pain when: 1) the principal reason for the visit was either stomach or abdominal pain, cramps, or spasms; 2) the visit was not the result of a referral; and 3) the physician had not previously seen the patient for the condition associated with the pain. Abdominal pain was the most frequent reason for a new pain visit. Women sought medical care for new abdominal pain more frequently than men. Most patients saw general practitioners or family physicians for evaluation of their pain, only 5% of patients were subsequently referred, and 6% were hospitalized. Clinical lab tests were ordered in 45% of new abdominal pain visits, while in approximately 20% X-ray procedures were ordered. Seventy percent of the patients were given a prescription, with antacids and antispasmodics being prescribed most frequently. 
Altered distribution of basic fibroblast growth factor in diabetic retinopathy. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a potent endothelial cell mitogen that has been proposed to play a role in proliferative diabetic retinopathy and other neovascular processes. Our understanding of the in vivo role of basic FGF in the pathogenesis of these disorders is limited. We studied the immunolocalization of basic FGF in 16 clinical cases of diabetic retinopathy to determine whether the normal retinal distribution of basic FGF changed during the development of diabetic retinopathy and correlated with the onset of retinal neovascularization. By using monoclonal and affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against basic FGF and heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), we found that basic FGF colocalized with HSPG to vascular basement membranes. As the basement membranes thickened during the progression of diabetic retinopathy, the intraretinal stores of immunoreactive basic FGF and HSPG expanded. With the development of neovascularization, the colocalization of basic FGF and HSPG changed; HSPG localized to basement membranes, while basic FGF localized intracellularly, with only minimal basement membrane immunoreactivity. Incubations of the neovascular fronds with exogenous basic FGF demonstrated multiple HSPG glycosaminoglycan-binding sites for basic FGF, indicating that basic FGF had not been released from the matrix of neovascular fronds by heparitanase digestion. 
A survey of antiemetic use in children with cancer. Pediatric oncologists within Pediatric Oncology Group institutions were surveyed to determine current antiemetic practices for children receiving chemotherapy and the basis for those practices. A mean severity rating for associated nausea and vomiting was calculated and used to rank 31 chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the treatment of childhood cancer. Antiemetics were used 17%, 79%, and 98% of the time for chemotherapeutic agents with mild, moderate, or severe associated nausea and vomiting, respectively. A median of one, two, and three antiemetics were used for mild, moderate, and severe agents, respectively. Antihistamines and phenothiazines were the drugs most commonly used for agents causing mild or moderate nausea and vomiting, and metoclopramide hydrochloride/antihistamines with lorazepam and/or corticosteroids were used most often for chemotherapeutic agents causing severe nausea and vomiting. Most oncologists based their choice of antiemetics on personal experience. Current literature addressing the treatment of nausea and vomiting in children receiving chemotherapy, as reviewed here, does not always support the present clinical practices. 
Geographic variations in the histologic characteristics of the gastric mucosa. Histologic sections of 205 gastrectomy specimens, which were obtained for benign and malignant diseases, were reviewed. All patients were Mexican nationals. The following histologic features were recorded: intestinal metaplasia, intramucosal cysts, ciliated gastric cells, and different types of pyloric cells ("ordinary"; with granular cytoplasm; with small cytoplasmic vacuoles; with large cytoplasmic vacuoles; or with homogeneous "glassy" cytoplasm). The percentage of specimens showing intestinal metaplasia was similar in those containing gastric ulcers (42.7%) or adenocarcinomas (50.0%). Intestinal metaplasia was decreased in men 59 years of age or older and in women 69 years of age or older. Diffuse-type adenocarcinoma accounted for 90% of the gastric tumors. Only 3 of the 205 specimens (1.9%) contained intramucosal cysts, and only 1 (0.4%) showed ciliated cells. Pyloric cells with granular cytoplasm were observed in 21.2% of the specimens, and pyloric cells with small cytoplasmic vacuoles were seen in 1.9%. Pyloric cells with large vacuoles or "glassy" cytoplasm were not found in any case. These results indicate differences in the proportions of several histopathologic findings in the gastric mucosa, between Mexicans and other ethnic groups that have been investigated in previous surveys. The authors' findings support the hypothesis that different environmental factors, acting in disparate geographic regions, may account for dissimilarities in the histologic appearance of "normal gastric mucosa.". 
Coronary-subclavian steal: correction of recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms. Six months following aortic valve replacement and myocardial revascularization using the left internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft, recurrent angina and cerebrovascular symptoms occurred in our patient. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated a subtotal stenosis of the proximal left subclavian artery and a patent internal mammary artery graft with angiographic steal from the myocardium. The angina and cerebrovascular symptoms were relieved with correction of the proximal subclavian stenosis by balloon angioplasty. This demonstrates the importance of aortic arch and subclavian evaluation and selected angiography prior to myocardial revascularization using the internal mammary artery as a pedicle graft. 
Treatment of acute systemic toxicity after the rapid intravenous injection of ropivacaine and bupivacaine in the conscious dog. Two groups of six beagle dogs received rapid intravenous (IV) injections of ropivacaine or bupivacaine on two occasions in a blinded random fashion. Initially, a dose sufficient to cause convulsions (CD) was given followed by twice the CD (2 x CD), which was administered 48 h later. The CD of bupivacaine (4.3 mg/kg) and ropivacaine (4.9 mg/kg) caused significant (P less than 0.05) increases in heart rate and mean arterial blood pressure. There was no difference between drug groups. Seizures were abolished by 10 mg/kg of intravenous thiamylal. Endotracheal intubation and controlled respiration with O2-enriched air with no other treatment resulted in rapid and complete recovery in all dogs. All dogs receiving 2 x CD of bupivacaine (8.6 mg/kg) or ropivacaine (9.8 mg/kg) were initially treated with thiamylal and mechanical ventilation. Two dogs in the bupivacaine group developed hypotension, respiratory arrest, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, which were resistant to closed chest cardiac massage, treatment with epinephrine, bretylium, and atropine, and direct current cardioversion. The four remaining dogs in the infusion group were successfully resuscitated. All of the animals in the ropivacaine-treated group survived the administration of the 2 x CD dose. Mild hypotension developed in one dog and was treated with intravenous epinephrine (0.75 mg). This resulted in nodal tachycardia, which was abolished after treatment with bretylium. Another dog had two 1-s bursts of premature ventricular contractions requiring no treatment. The rapid treatment of convulsions and cardiovascular toxicity resulted in a decreased number of deaths in both groups when compared with dogs from a previously published study in which no therapy was instituted. Thus, early aggressive treatment of central nervous system and cardiovascular system toxicity is capable of reducing the incidence of mortality associated with the rapid intravenous administration of excessive doses of local anesthetics. 
Abnormally high level of C4b binding protein and deficiency of free fraction of protein S in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and recurrent thromboses. A patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and numerous thrombotic accidents was found to have a deficiency of the free fraction of protein S, most likely due to an abnormally high level of C4b binding protein. These abnormalities, unique in comparison to 4 other patients with hypercoagulation states, were partially corrected with cyclophosphamide. There was no evidence of a consumption of complement components. The interactions between the hemostasis system and the complement cascade are discussed. 
Clinical symptoms in young adults with atypical chest pain attending the emergency department. Clinical symptoms were studied in 69 consecutive patients below the age of 40 years who were attending the emergency unit because of unexplained chest pain. In a structured interview a few weeks after the emergency visit, only one-third of the patients reported that they believed in the doctor's diagnosis; they believed in a psychological or cardiac origin of the pain more often than the doctors. The chest pain was most often described as oppressive and/or stabbing. In 95% of cases it was central or left-sided. Associated symptoms were commonly reported, breathlessness being most commonly reported by two-thirds of the patients, followed by dizziness, palpitation and numbness/tingling. Mental symptoms such as tiredness, anxiety and tension were frequently reported. On the basis of the background literature the aetiology is discussed. We conclude that immediate symptom analysis, including psychosomatic symptoms, particularly breathing problems, is of central importance. 
Pleuropulmonary complications of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. The most common pulmonary complication of EVS is pleural effusion. The most clinically significant pulmonary complication of EVS is delayed perforation with formation of esophagopleural or esophagobronchial fistula. Pneumonia, empyema, pulmonary infarction, and atelectasis can also occur. Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy probably does not cause ARDS, but that issue remains unsettled. Transient relative pulmonary hypertension during EVS is probably of no clinical significance, but caution is urged when sclerosing varices in a patient with borderline right heart function. 
Identification of transforming genes of subgroup A and C strains of Herpesvirus saimiri. Herpesvirus saimiri is an oncogenic herpesvirus that induces rapidly progressing lymphomas in New World primates. Using retrovirus vectors for gene transfer, specific open reading frames of H. saimiri were tested for their ability to transform rodent cells in culture. One open reading frame, designated STP-C488 (for saimiri-transformation-associated protein of the subgroup C strain 488), phenotypically transformed Rat-1 cells, resulting in formation of foci, growth at reduced serum concentration, and growth to higher cell densities. Cells transformed by STP-C488 formed invasive tumors in nude mice. The STP-A11 reading frame of strain 11 (subgroup A) was much less potent in its transforming ability than STP-C488. These results demonstrate the oncogene nature of these two open reading frames and provide a means for studying their transforming functions independent of the rest of the H. saimiri genome. 
Beneficial effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine on apolipoproteins in hypertensive patients. The objective of the study was to assess the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine on plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins in patients with essential hypertension. After a four-week placebo wash-out period, 73 patients (41 men, 32 women) were studied in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study comparing sustained-release isradipine (isradipine SR) with the standard isradipine formulation. Nineteen patients received 5 mg/day and 54 patients 10 mg/day. Lipids were evaluated at the end of the placebo period and after 12 weeks of treatment with isradipine. In both treatment groups, lipid and lipoproteins were not modified. However, apolipoprotein A-I levels increased significantly (P less than .001) and the ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A-I concentration decreased significantly (P less than .01) irrespective of gender. These data show that the levels of plasma apolipoprotein A-I, a strong predictor of coronary heart disease, are favorably affected by isradipine of either formulation. The mechanisms of this effect remain to be elucidated. 
Intracranial metastasis of a choroid plexus papilloma originating in the cerebellopontine angle region: a case report. The authors present a rare case in which a choroid plexus papilloma originating in the left cerebellopontine angle region metastasized and formed a space-occupying lesion in the right temporal region. A 46-year-old woman with choked disks presented with two separate mass lesions in the right temporal and the left cerebellopontine angle regions. Magnetic resonance imaging exhibited the relationship between the tumors and the surrounding structures. To our knowledge, no case has been reported in which a choroid plexus papilloma originating in the cerebellopontine angle region formed a space-occupying lesion in the right temporal region. 
Clinical, physiologic, anatomic and procedural factors predictive of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. In a recent prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trial, a combination of aspirin and dipyridamole was not associated with a reduction in the rate of restenosis within the 1st 6 months after coronary angioplasty. The purpose of this study was to determine whether clinical, anatomic or procedural factors were predictive of the observed restenosis rates in that prospective trial. A total of 247 patients and 280 segments underwent follow-up angiography and quantitative coronary angiographic analysis between 4 and 7 months after coronary angioplasty. Two baseline clinical characteristics--angina class and duration of angina in months--were related to the rate of restenosis by univariate analysis. Patient-related stepwise logistic regression analysis identified severity of angina as the only clinical predictor of restenosis. Three univariate baseline anatomic characteristics--percent diameter stenosis before angioplasty, stenosis greater than 10 mm in length and calcific stenosis--and two early postangioplasty characteristics--residual percent diameter stenosis and residual mean pressure gradient--were predictive of restenosis. Of these, only two--length of stenosis and residual percent diameter stenosis--were independently related to restenosis by multivariate analysis and only the former is identifiable before the procedure. It is concluded that in prospective studies in contrast to retrospective studies, few clinical and anatomic factors appear to be predictive of restenosis after coronary angioplasty. 
Serum lipoprotein (a) levels in men with peripheral vascular disease. The authors quantified serum lipoprotein (a) (Lp) (a) by enzymo-immuno-analysis in 86 outpatient men suffering peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and in 53 age-matched healthy men. They further measured serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, low density lipoproteins-cholesterol, high density lipoproteins (HDL)-cholesterol and serum apolipoprotein B. Serum triglycerides were significantly increased in patients with PVD versus controls (148 +/- 8 and 114 +/- 7 mg/dL, mean +/- SEM). HDL-cholesterol levels were significantly lower in patients versus controls (36 +/- 1 and 43 +/- 2 mg/dL, respectively). Serum Lp(a) levels in patients with PVD were 20 +/- 2 mg/dL, whereas in controls they were 16 +/- 3 (p: NS). Serum Lp(a) concentrations were identical in smoker and nonsmoker patients. There was no correlation between Lp(a) concentration and the other lipid parameters. Conversely, as occurs in coronary heart disease and in cerebrovascular disease, Lp(a) does not seem to be a marker for PVD, although a trend toward a higher mean levels was found. 
Third-degree atrioventricular block in an athlete. There is a wide spectrum of changes in the resting electrocardiograms of athletes. We here present a case of third-degree atrioventricular block in an asymptomatic young athlete. 
Septicaemia after colonoscopy in patients with cirrhosis. Two patients with ulcerative colitis and chronic active hepatitis with cirrhosis, who developed Gram negative septicaemia after colonoscopy are described. These and two similar reported cases indicate that giving prophylactic antibiotics to patients with cirrhosis undergoing colonoscopy should be considered, particularly when the cirrhosis is advanced. 
Oral water intoxication in infants. An American epidemic Between 1975 and 1990, a total of 34 patients with water intoxication were treated at St Louis (Mo) Children's Hospital, 24 of these in the last 3 years, indicating a marked increase in incidence of this previously rare condition. Thirty-one were infants living in poverty who ingested excessive amounts of water offered at home by their caretakers. Exhaustion of the supply of infant formula was the most common reason given for this substitution. Infants were treated by a single infusion of hypertonic saline or a slow infusion of isotonic saline. Central pontine myelinolysis was not observed as a complication of hypertonic saline therapy. Modification of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children to provide sufficient formula for the growing infant and better education of mothers as to the hazards of excessive water ingestion might reduce the incidence of this preventable and life-threatening condition. 
A comparison of the results following oromandibular reconstruction using a radial forearm flap with either radial bone or a reconstruction plate. Fifteen cases of oromandibular reconstruction using a radial osteocutaneous flap were compared with 16 in which the mandible was replaced with a reconstruction plate and a forearm flap was used for intraoral lining. All cases involved oral cancer; most had been irradiated. Nine survived in each group. Complications included one infected nonunion in addition to two bone exposures in the bone group, compared with three cases of plate exposure and two bone exposures in the plate group. Functional results were similar in both, but osteointegrated implants were possible only in the patients receiving bone. Cosmesis seemed somewhat better in the plate group. Donor-site problems were common but minor, and long-term forearm function was slightly reduced in both groups. Although the sample sizes were small, the reconstruction plate together with a radial forearm flap appeared to provide effective reconstruction following composite resection. However, we would not recommend this for the younger patient or in benign disease. 
Massive cardiac involvement of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. An autopsy case. We describe an unusual autopsy case of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma with massive cardiac involvement. The patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of fever and cervical lymph node enlargement, which improved following treatment with vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide (Endoxan), prednisolone sodium succinate, and doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin). He was then followed up in the outpatient clinic, but was readmitted to the hospital with palpitations and dyspnea. Cardiomegaly developed rapidly, and the patient died of congestive heart failure 3 months after readmission. The heart was massively enlarged at autopsy. The heart, including adhered surrounding tissue, weighed 1600 g. The myocardium was found to be replaced by massive infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells. Cardiac involvement by adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma may result from extension or retrograde flow through cardiac lymphatics from the destroyed mediastinal lymphatic system. 
Perfusion without systemic heparinization for rewarming in accidental hypothermia. We report on a patient with accidental deep hypothermia (23.3 degrees C) and cardiorespiratory arrest resulting from severe craniocerebral injury. Systemic anticoagulation was contraindicated, and the decision was reached to rewarm the patient with cardiopulmonary bypass without systemic heparinization using heparin-coated perfusion equipment. The patient was successfully rewarmed, was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, and recovered. 
Intraoperative cardiovascular collapse secondary to latex allergy. An apparent allergic reaction has been noted in children undergoing open urological surgery. This condition is characterized by precipitous hypotension, tachycardia and upper body flushing, and it often causes termination of the procedure. Latex allergy has been identified as the possible inciting event. Contact of latex rubber gloves with intra-abdominal structures (handling bowel) appears to be the most dramatic trigger mechanism for this reaction. We report on 10 patients with latex allergy, 6 of whom have myelomeningocele, who have undergone reconstructive surgery. Severe anaphylactic shock developed intraoperatively in 5 patients and during a barium enema performed with a latex catheter in 1 patient. These 6 patients had previous allergic reactions to latex material, which was not detected preoperatively. In the remaining 4 patients latex allergy was diagnosed preoperatively. A total of 6 patients agreed to a skin prick test to liquid latex. Three patients reacted with a wheal size greater than or equal to a histamine control at a dilution of 1:1,000 and 3 patients at 1:100. In contrast, none of the 5 normal controls reacted to any of the concentrations including full strength latex. A history of exposure to latex products (balloons, surgical gloves, catheters, condoms and so forth) with allergic reactions should heighten surgeon awareness of a potentially severe intraoperative reaction. Furthermore, a skin prick test may be used to screen high risk patients such as those with myelomeningocele. A protocol involving preoperative corticosteroid and antihistamine therapy is recommended. 
Cardiac angiosarcoma with ruptured right atrium diagnosed by echocardiography. A 41-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of right-sided chest pain. Two-dimensional echocardiographic examination revealed a ruptured right atrium and a localized pericardial effusion. Color Doppler echocardiography and contrast echocardiography showed blood flow from the right atrium into pericardial effusion, which was confirmed at emergency surgery. The pathologic specimen from the right atrium showed a spindle cell angiosarcoma. 
Chinese hamster ovarian cells transfected with the murine interleukin-6 gene cause hypercalcemia as well as cachexia, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis in tumor-bearing nude mice. The effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vivo were assessed by inoculating Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells which were transfected with the murine IL-6 gene in nude mice. Nude mice bearing CHO cells expressing IL-6 developed hypercalcemia. Tumor-bearing mice also showed increases in white cell count, platelet count, and decreases in body weight. In nude mice carrying CHO tumors which had not been transfected with the IL-6 gene, there were no changes in these parameters. These results suggest that increased circulating concentrations of IL-6 in patients with malignant disease may contribute to a number of paraneoplastic syndromes including hypercalcemia, cachexia, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. 
HIV infection among women entering the New York State correctional system. Human immunodeficiency virus infection is the leading medical problem among prison inmates in several states. In 1988 a blinded seroprevalence study was conducted on 480 New York female prison entrants to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for HIV infection in this population. Ninety (18.8 percent) women were HIV-seropositive. Seroprevalence was highest among women ages 30-39 (25.0 percent) and varied by ethnicity (Hispanics, 29.4 percent; Blacks, 14.4 percent; Whites, 7.1 percent) and residence (New York City, 23.8 percent; Upstate, 5.1 percent). Nearly half (44.9 percent) of the 136 acknowledged intravenous drug users and one-third (33.8 percent) of the 71 women with a positive syphilis serology were HIV-seropositive. There was no difference in fertility histories between seropositive and seronegative women, and two of 21 pregnant women were seropositive. This study led to increased clinical and prevention services for this high-risk population. 
Giant, human immunodeficiency virus-related ulcers in the esophagus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the esophagus has recently been implicated as a cause of giant esophageal ulcers in HIV-positive patients with odynophagia. The authors examined four patients in whom esophagograms (one single-contrast and three double-contrast studies) revealed giant, HIV-related ulcers indistinguishable from those of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis. All four patients had severe odynophagia, one had an associated maculopapular rash, and two became HIV-positive at approximately the time of clinical presentation. In all patients, biopsy samples, brushings, and cultures obtained with endoscopy were negative for CMV or herpes simplex. One patient had positive brushings for candidiasis, but this may have resulted from fungal superinfection of the ulcer. Two patients were treated with orally administered steroids, and all four had swift clinical improvement; symptoms disappeared during an average period of 8.3 days from presentation. HIV-related esophageal ulcers should be distinguished from CMV ulcers, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated in these patients. 
A prospective randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy with bolus versus continuous infusion of doxorubicin in patients with high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcoma and an analysis of prognostic factors. A prospective randomized trial was conducted to compare the cardiotoxic and therapeutic effects of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks) administered by bolus or 72-hour continuous infusion as adjuvant chemotherapy in 82 eligible patients after resection of high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or superficial trunk. Cardiac toxicity, defined as a 10% or greater decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction as assessed by radionuclide cineangiography, was evaluated in 69 patients. Cardiotoxicity was seen in 61% of patients in the bolus treatment arm with the median doxorubicin dose of 420 mg/m2. Among patients who received continuous infusion, 42% had cardiotoxicity with a median dose of 540 mg/m2. The rate of cardiotoxicity as a function of the cumulative dose of doxorubicin was significantly higher in the bolus treatment arm (P = 0.0017). Two patients in each group had clinical congestive heart failure, with one cardiac death occurring in each. There was a trend toward a lower rate of metastasis (P = 0.19) and a significantly lower rate of death of disease (P = 0.036) for patients treated with the bolus dose. Cox model analysis identified three unfavorable characteristics for the rate of developing a distant metastasis: blood transfusion within 24 hours of operation (P less than 0.00001), tumor deep to the fascia and 5 cm or more in size (P = 0.0043), and a histologic subtype other than liposarcoma (P = 0.0002). The unfavorable effect of continuous infusion was not selected in the model (P = 0.16). Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with soft tissue sarcoma is investigational. Furthermore, the impact of perioperative blood transfusion merits further study. 
Balloon diameter of the Inoue balloon catheter during percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy: clinical and experimental study. To determine adequate and effective balloon diameters of the Inoue balloon catheter, we reviewed clinical results and characteristics of the Inoue balloon catheter, especially the relationship between the intra-balloon pressure and the balloon diameter, experimentally and clinically, in 46 patients with mitral stenosis undergoing percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC). Mitral valve area increased from 1.1 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.3 cm2 in all patients after PTMC. Based on balloon diameter settings, mitral valve area increased from 1.3 +/- 0.4 to 2.3 +/- 0.5 cm2 in patients treated with a balloon setting greater than 26 mm in diameter, from 1.1 +/- 0.3 to 2.0 +/- 0.5 cm2 in patients with a balloon setting at 26 mm in diameter, and from 1.1 +/- 0.4 to 1.7 +/- 0.4 cm2 in those treated with a balloon setting less than 26 mm in diameter, with an increase in mitral valve area of 1.0 +/- 0.6, 0.9 +/- 0.4, and 0.7 +/- 0.2 cm2, respectively. There was a significant difference between the increase in mitral valve area at a setting of 26 mm in diameter and that observed at a setting less than 26 mm in diameter. We next investigated differences between balloon diameter settings and actual balloon diameters measured from cineangiograms at maximum balloon inflation. The ratio of actual balloon diameter to a setting diameter of less than 26 mm was smaller than that of 26 mm. To evaluate the reason for the difference, we investigated the relationship between intra-balloon pressure and balloon diameter. In the prototype Inoue balloon catheter, intra-balloon pressure increases from 1.0 kg/cm2 at 20 mm in diameter to 2.2 kg/cm2 at 30 mm in diameter at atmospheric pressure. In conclusion, the increase in mitral valve area was inadequate when the balloon was less than 26 mm in diameter because of inadequate intra-balloon pressure. We, therefore, recommend a balloon size set above 26 mm to obtain adequate intra-balloon pressure when using the Inoue balloon catheter. 
Abdominal aortic aneurysms complicated by spontaneous iliocaval or duodenal fistulae. Seven hundred and twenty one abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated between 1960 and 1985. Twenty one of these (2.9%) were complicated by the development of a spontaneous primary fistula, 16 (2.2%) into the vena cava or iliac veins and 5 (0.7%) into the duodenum. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only four instances, two aorto-caval and two aorto-duodenal fistulae. Hospital mortality was 44% for aorto-caval and 60% for aorto-duodenal fistulae. Despite the lack of a precise preoperative diagnosis in the majority of cases, the prognosis for aorto-caval fistula remained comparable to that for patients undergoing emergency surgery for uncomplicated ruptured aortic aneurysms. The mortality of spontaneous aorto-duodenal fistulae was appreciably higher and the aneurysmal contents of 4 out of these 5 cases had positive bacterial cultures. 
Ocular inflammation in Crohn's disease. During a 4-year period, the authors examined 19 patients with Crohn's disease and associated ocular inflammation. Seven patients had uveitis, eight had episcleritis, and four had anterior scleritis. Large peripheral corneal infiltrates developed in two patients with scleritis. Increased bowel activity was closely related to the presence of acute episcleritis but not to uveitis or scleritis. To determine risk factors for the development of ocular inflammation, this group of 19 patients was compared with a group of 93 patients with Crohn's disease in whom ocular inflammation was not present. There were no demographic differences between the groups. Patients with colitis or ileocolitis were more likely to suffer from ocular inflammation (23.9%, 17 of 71), than patients with small bowel involvement alone (2.8%, 1 of 36) (P = 0.013). Those with arthritis or arthralgia had a higher incidence of ocular inflammation (29.4%, 15 of 51), than patients without joint involvement (6.6%, 4 of 61) (P = 0.003). These results suggest that the risk of developing ocular inflammation in Crohn's disease may be related to the site of bowel involvement and to the presence of arthritis. 
Systemic and pulmonary circulatory effects of protamine following cardiopulmonary bypass in man. The cardiovascular effects of protamine were studied in 19 men with normal left ventricular function undergoing primary myocardial revascularization. Protamine was given over 120 sec after termination of cardiopulmonary bypass. Arterial and pulmonary pressures, aortic blood flow, central venous pressure, heart rate and electrocardiogram were continuously registered. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was recorded at the times of maximal hemodynamic response. The systolic arterial pressure fell from 116 to 66 mmHg about 60 sec after the start of protamine infusion, but spontaneously began to rise after a few seconds, reaching 90% of pre-protamine levels at 126 sec. No inotropic drugs or volume infusion were given. At about 2 min, the mean pulmonary artery pressure rose from 16.3 to 26.2 mmHg and the central venous pressure from 7.0 to 11.4 mmHg. The heart rate and cardiac output were almost unchanged throughout. Systemic hypotension and pulmonary hypertension are suggested to represent true side effects of protamine or protamine/heparin complex. When left ventricular function is good, the hypotension reverses without treatment. Volume infusion may indeed precipitate right heart failure when the pre-load effect is added to the subsequent protamine-induced pulmonary hypertension. 
A randomized, controlled trial of treatment of alcoholic hepatitis with parenteral nutrition and oxandrolone. I. Short-term effects on liver function. The present studies were designed to provide careful measures of effects of oxandrolone, an anabolic steroid, intravenous nutritional supplementation, and the combination of these two treatments on liver functions, metabolic balances, nitrogen metabolism, and nutritional status in patients with moderate to severe alcoholic hepatitis. Of 43 patients originally recruited, 39 (19 men, 20 women) with typical clinical and laboratory features of alcoholic hepatitis (11 Child's-Pugh class B; 28 class C) were admitted to a metabolic unit and completed a 35-day three-phase protocol. Phase I was a 10-day baseline period of observation, during which routine and special quantitative tests of liver function (galactose and antipyrine metabolism), a 7-day elemental balance study, and a 15N, 13C-leucine metabolism study were done. Phase II was a 21-day treatment period during which patients were randomly assigned to receive one of four regimens: 1) standard therapy, consisting of abstinence, a balanced, nutritionally adequate diet, and multivitamins; 2) oxandrolone (20 mg orally four times a day) plus standard therapy; 3) nutritional supplementation, consisting of 2 L daily of 3.5% crystalline amino acids (in 5% dextrose), given by peripheral vein; or 4) a combination of oxandrolone and nutritional supplementation, along with standard therapy. Metabolic balances were repeated during phase II. Phase III was 2 or 3 days posttreatment, during which special studies of liver functions and volumes and leucine metabolism were repeated. All patients who completed phase I of study and were randomly allocated to one of the four treatment groups completed the subsequent two phases. Overall, with time, patients showed highly significant improvements in most clinical and laboratory features. For most standard laboratory tests (e.g., serum albumin, transferrin, prothrombin time) improvements were more marked in patients treated with nutritional supplementation and/or oxandrolone than in those given standard therapy alone. Liver volumes fell in all treatment groups, with greater improvement in those treated with nutritional supplementation. Improvements in galactose and antipyrine metabolism rates were significant only in those treated with nutritional supplementation or oxandrolone. Effects of treatments on metabolic balances, nitrogen metabolism, and measures of nutrition are described in this issue in a companion paper. We conclude that the addition of nutritional supplementation and oxandrolone to standard therapy of moderately severe or severe alcoholic hepatitis is well tolerated, and leads to more rapid improvement in the laboratory parameters measured. 
Myocardial lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzyme activities in transplanted human hearts. Lactate dehydrogenase and its heart (H) and muscle (M) subunit activities were studied in right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from eight transplanted human hearts and compared with five chronically failing hearts and six normal human hearts from brain-dead liver/kidney donors. Of the 17 transplant biopsies (taken 5-95 weeks postoperatively), only two showed histologic signs of chronic rejection: They were excluded from the group analysis. A higher proportion of the M subunit of lactate dehydrogenase (M%) was found in the transplanted and the chronically failing hearts than in the normal hearts, presumably reflecting increased myocardial anaerobic glycolytic stress. In the early post-transplantation period, M% was higher in the transplanted than in the chronically failing hearts. Thereafter M% gradually fell, but had not reached normal levels 1-2 years after transplantation. During that time it was similar to the values in the chronic-failure hearts. In the two biopsies with chronic rejection, M% was nearly twice as high as in contemporaneous biopsies showing mild or no rejection. Monitoring of enzymatic adaptation from endomyocardial biopsies may be of clinical interest. 
Genetic basis for p53 overexpression in human breast cancer. Overexpression of an activated form of the p53 protein may be involved in neoplastic transformation. We found widespread overexpression of p53 by immunohistochemical staining in 11 (22%) of 49 primary invasive human breast cancers. Northern blot analysis showed that this overexpression was not due to an increase in the steady-state level of p53 mRNA. The p53 gene was directly sequenced in 7 of these tumors with elevated levels of the protein and, in each case, a mutation that altered the coding sequence for p53 was found in a highly conserved region of the gene. Whereas 4 of these tumors contained only a mutant p53 allele, the other 3 tumors exhibited coding sequences from both a mutant and a wild-type allele. p53 mutations have previously been correlated with allelic loss of part of chromosome 17p that contains the p53 locus. Examination of all 49 breast tumors revealed a 61% frequency of deletion at or near the p53 locus. However, the presence of allelic deletion did not correlate with overexpression of the protein. Six tumors that were deleted but did not express high levels of the protein were sequenced and all retained a wild-type p53 allele. In this series of human breast cancers, overexpression of the p53 protein, not allelic loss on chromosome 17p, was always associated with mutation of the p53 gene. 
Small cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract: an immunohistochemical, electron microscopic and clinicopathological study. We examined 13 cases of small cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract to evaluate and compare the immunocytochemical and ultrastructural features as well as the clinicopathological behavior. Immunohistochemical stains revealed that neuron specific enolase and chromogranin showed differences in staining between the bladder and prostate, as well as between the small cell and adenocarcinomatous components of the prostate. Also, synaptophysin was negative over-all in 12 of 13 cases. Epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen and keratin showed strong focal positivity within the small cell component. Electron microscopy was performed in 4 cases, with 3 demonstrating neurosecretory granules. Clinically, 6 of the 7 patients with adenocarcinoma/small cell carcinoma of the prostate did poorly, all with a survival of 15 months or less. Of 5 patients with transitional cell/small cell carcinoma of the bladder 2 fared better (both had no evidence of disease at 12 months and 11 years, respectively). Based upon the immunostaining and electron microscopic findings, small cell carcinoma of the genitourinary tract is heterogeneous in appearance and, therefore, may arise from a multipotential cell of origin. This cell of origin may be organ-specific, as demonstrated by the variability in staining characteristics among the prostate, bladder and kidney, as well as by the differences in the clinical behavior of these malignancies. Small cell carcinoma of the prostate has a poor prognosis, while small cell carcinoma of the bladder may portend a better prognosis if diagnosed at an early stage. 
Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser-assisted pulmonary resections. The neodymium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser is a new approach to limited pulmonary resection. It avoids distortion of surrounding pulmonary tissue and potential pleural space problems, which can occur with mechanical stapler resections. We have recently used this laser to manage 39 pulmonary lesions in 20 patients. There were no major postoperative complications, and air leak after resection was minimal. Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser excision is a useful method that may have an advantage over mechanical stapling techniques for the limited resection of many pulmonary lesions. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated gastropathy: incidence and risk factor models PURPOSE: The most prevalent serious drug toxicity in the United States is increasingly recognized as gastrointestinal (GI) pathology associated with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The incidence of serious GI events (hospitalization or death) associated with NSAID use was therefore prospectively analyzed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and patients with osteoarthritis. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: The study consisted of 2,747 patients with RA and 1,091 patients with osteoarthritis. The yearly hospitalization incidence during NSAID treatment was 1.58% in RA patients and was similar in all five populations studied. The hazard ratio of patients taking NSAIDs to those not taking NSAIDs was 5.2. The incidence in osteoarthritis may be less. The risk of GI-related death in RA patients was 0.19% per year with NSAIDs. Multivariate analyses assessing risk factors for serious GI events were performed in the 1,694 (98 with an event) RA patients taking NSAIDs at the predictive visit. The main risk factors were higher age, use of prednisone, previous NSAID GI side effects, prior GI hospitalization, level of disability, and NSAID dose. A rule is presented that allows estimation of the risk for the individual patient with RA. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the risk factors for NSAID-associated gastropathy and their inter-relationships provides a tool for identification of the patient at high risk and for initiation of appropriate therapeutic action. 
Renal failure due to bronchogenic adenocarcinoma metastatic to kidneys. A case is presented of a fifty-eight-year-old woman with bronchogenic adenocarcinoma in whom renal failure developed manifested by hypertension and azotemia. Subsequent percutaneous needle aspiration biopsy confirmed metastatic renal involvement. No etiology other than renal infiltration due to metastatic bronchogenic adenocarcinoma was found to explain the renal failure. Literature review revealed no previous reported case of metastatic bronchogenic adenocarcinoma to the kidney presenting antemortem with renal failure. 
Determinants of sciatica and low-back pain. Several factors were studied for their association with the prevalence of chronic low-back syndromes, sciatica, and unspecified low-back pain (LBP) in 2,946 women and 2,727 men (age range, 30-64 years) participating in the Mini-Finland Health Survey, a project aimed at comprehensive evaluation of the population's health. On the basis of a standardized clinical examination, a physician diagnosed sciatica in 5.1% and LBP in 11.6% of the subjects. Those with a previous traumatic back injury had a 2.5-fold risk of having sciatica or LBP. The fractions of sciatica and LBP attributable to such back injuries were estimated to be 16.5% and 13.7%, respectively. Sum indices of both physical and mental stress at work were found to be directly proportional to the prevalence of sciatica and LBP. Smokers had an increased risk of LBP, and body height was related positively to the prevalence of sciatica. These associations, however, were inconsistent between sex and age subgroups. In the presence of osteoarthritis in the knee, hip, or hand, LBP was prevalent (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-6.9), but sciatica was not (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.7). Diabetics were found to have a significantly decreased prevalence of LBP (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.3-0.8). Many factors, independent of each other, determine the occurrence of chronic low-back syndromes. The determinants of sciatica and LBP are different to some extent. 
Myointimal hyperplasia as a result of balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy. The balloon-tipped embolectomy catheter is widely utilized in the treatment of arterial thromboemboli, significantly improving mortality and limb salvage rates. However, early and late complications related to catheter-tip injury and balloon trauma continue to occur and compromise the results of surgical intervention. Myointimal hyperplasia is an example of an unusual late complication induced by balloon-related arterial wall trauma. Myointimal hyperplasia is a commonly recognized healing response of the arterial wall to endothelial injury but is rarely reported after balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy. The extensive nature of the injury increases the incidence of limb loss. The pathophysiologic nature of this process is reviewed, and pertinent structural details such as intimal thickening and disruption of the internal elastic lamina are presented. The pathogenesis of myointimal hyperplasia suggests guidelines for catheter use during embolectomy that may further reduce the incidence of this unusual complication. 
Oral contraceptive use and coronary risk factors in women. The relationship between oral contraceptive use and other coronary artery disease risk factors was examined in 215 nonsmoking women grouped as never, current, or previous users. Current oral contraceptive users had higher triglyceride levels (p less than or equal to 0.001) than other groups, higher systolic blood pressure, and lower plasma HDL-cholesterol levels (p less than or equal to 0.05) than previous users. The effect of oral contraceptive use on plasma triglyceride values persists on multivariate regression analysis independently of age, body mass index, dietary sodium and cholesterol intake, cigarette smoking, and level of physical activity. Oral contraceptive use also has an independent relationship to the plasma total cholesterol/HDL- cholesterol ratio. These findings indicate that oral contraceptive use is adversely associated with plasma lipid and lipoprotein values. 
A simple radiologic method to estimate the quantity of bowel gas. Patients with functional bowel disorders frequently complain of bloating and abdominal pain, but no practical method is available to measure intestinal gas objectively. To evaluate a new technique, we evaluated 54 abdominal radiographs from 19 patients. A gastroenterologist and a radiologist independently outlined the intestinal gas bubbles in these films. Areas of gas bubbles were measured with a computer digitizing board. Bowel gas was also measured in 24 healthy controls, and in five emergency room patients, supine and erect radiographs were compared to evaluate the effects of position on bowel gas patterns. The two evaluators agreed well on the measured areas of bowel gas (r = 0.96), showing that this is a reliable method. Bowel gas was significantly greater in patients than in controls but did not correlate with symptoms. Bowel gas was significantly greater in supine than upright films, showing that the position of the patient must be standardized. 
Successful epicardial pacing in blunt trauma resuscitation. Epicardial pacing wires were used successfully in the resuscitation of a moribund victim of blunt trauma after fluid resuscitation and chemical measures had failed. Application of these wires to treat the bradycardia of shock should be considered in selected patients when standard measures fail. 
Formation and spontaneous closure of an arteriovenous fistula after transvenous pacemaker placement. We report the findings in a patient with the unusual complication of arteriovenous fistula formation of the subclavian vessels seven weeks following placement of a dual-chamber pacemaker. The fistula's subsequent course was equally unusual, closing spontaneously three weeks later. It is postulated that the thrombotic and fibrotic reaction elicited by the leads contributed to the fistula's closure. Two surgical procedures, correction of the fistula and reimplantation of the pacemaker, were thus avoided by careful monitoring of the patient. 
Ileal segment for ureteral substitution or for improvement of ureteral function. A total of 29 patients received an ileal segment interposition between the upper and lower urinary tract for partial or total ureteral substitution, or for ileal wrapping around a massively dilated, aperistaltic ureter. Indications for an operation included the presence of an extensively diseased or short ureter and an aperistaltic megaureter that had failed previous reconstructive attempts. Nine patients (group 1) underwent an ileal sleeve procedure in an attempt to increase the ureteral peristaltic activity and facilitate drainage. Among these patients 7 (78%) had a stable upper tract radiologically and normal serum creatinine (less than 1.6 mg./100 ml.), while 2 (22%) had deterioration of the renal function. Ten patients (group 2) had undergone a myriad of reconstructions that failed and then underwent complete ureteral substitution with ileum. Among them, renal function (as evidenced by excretory urography and serum creatinine) is stable in 7 (70%) and deteriorated in 3 (30%). In 10 patients (group 3) the ureters were partially replaced by ileum in addition to a bladder augmentation procedure. Of these patients 8 (80%) have stable renal function and 2 (20%) had renal failure. Over-all, 7 patients have different degrees of renal failure; among them 2 (6.9%) are on dialysis and 2 (6.9%) have received a transplanted kidney. In groups 2 and 3 the results with an antireflux operation indicated that among 6 ureteroileal reimplantations 5 (83%) were successful, among 12 intravesical intestinal nipples 6 (50%) failed to prevent reflux and there was no case of obstruction, while among 4 ileocecal intussusceptions 2 (50%) were successful and 2 failed. Mucous secretion produced temporary ureteral obstruction in 1 ureter (3.4%), which resolved without surgical intervention. Some of the aforementioned procedures were done in the past and in some situations a different reconstructive technique would be considered presently. The surgical complexity and magnitude of the procedures justify their performance only in difficult clinical situations as an alternative to urinary diversion or renal autotransplantation. 
Comparison of cellular protooncogene activation and transformation-related activity of human melanocytes and metastatic melanoma. Two cell lines (NH and HM1), established from patients with metastatic melanomas, were evaluated for the presence of activated cellular protooncogenes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated increased expression of the c-myc gene (from 9 to 14 times) in NH and HM1 cell lines by densitometric comparison with human melanocyte cell lines. Analysis of the expression of 13 additional cellular protooncogenes revealed either no detectable levels (c-fms, c-abl, v-src, c-erb A1, c-erb B, v-mos, TGF beta, and c-myb) or unaltered expression levels (cH-ras, N-ras, c-fos, and c-sis) in normal human melanocytes and metastatic melanomas. Elevated expression of the c-myc gene was also detected in two long-term cultured melanoma cell lines (RPMI 7951 and SKMEL-30). Analysis of c-myc expression by in situ hybridization in HM1 cells showed that expression was not localized to a sub-population of cycling cells and all cells were overexpressing c-myc mRNA. Differences in relative abundance of c-myc transcripts suggests a relationship with the ability of DNA from these cell lines to efficiently transform NIH 3T3 cells and form colonies on soft agar. 
Assessment of systemic effects of different ophthalmic beta-blockers in healthy volunteers. Systemic beta-blockade after single doses of ophthalmic beta-blockers (one drop in each eye) was investigated in healthy volunteers in two randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled studies. beta-Blockade was evaluated by displacement of the bronchodilator (specific airway conductance), positive chronotropic (heart rate), and tremorogenic (finger tremor amplitude) dose-response curve for inhaled isoproterenol. In study 1, 0.5% betaxolol, 0.6% metipranolol, and 0.5% timolol were tested in 16 subjects. Compared with placebo, all beta-blockers resulted in a significant systemic beta-blockade (p greater than 0.05); the increasing order of potency was betaxolol, metipranolol, and timolol. In study 2, 2% butylamino-phenoxy-propanol-acetate (BPPA; a noncardioselective but topically oculoselective drug) and 1% timolol were investigated in 12 subjects. Placebo and BPPA showed no differences (p greater than 0.05), whereas timolol resulted in a significant beta-blockade (p less than 0.05). Topical oculoselectivity is an important aspect of drug safety of beta-blocking eyedrops. Measure of tremor is appropriate to evaluate beta 2-blockade. 
Randomized study on the effect of collagen impregnation of knitted Dacron velour aortoiliac prostheses on blood loss during aortic reconstruction. Intraoperative blood loss is an important factor in reconstructive surgery for aortoiliac disease because it is clearly associated with an increase in the operative morbidity and mortality rates. To minimize intraoperative blood loss, a blood-tight vascular prosthesis has been developed by impregnating a knitted Dacron prosthesis with bovine collagen. To study a potential reduction of intraoperative blood loss using these collagen-impregnated prostheses, we conducted a prospective randomized trial involving the collagen-impregnated prosthesis and its non-impregnated substrate, the Dacron knitted non-impregnated prosthesis. During a 2.5-year period, 123 consecutive patients (undergoing 81 procedures for aneurysmal disease and 43 procedures for occlusive disease) were admitted for elective aortic reconstructive surgery. Equal numbers of the two prostheses were randomly implanted. Various parameters were monitored: intraoperative blood loss before aortic cross-clamping (phase 1), during implantation of the prosthesis (phase 2) and after release of aorta cross-clamping (phase 3); the number of intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusions; and, finally, all preoperative and intraoperative factors that might contribute to intraoperative blood loss. A significant overall difference in intraoperative blood loss between the collagen-impregnated (2425 ml) and the non-impregnated (1907 ml) group was found (P = 0.003). However, this difference could not be attributed to collagen impregnation because no statistically significant difference in blood loss was found in the relevant period of operation (phase 3). Similar results were observed in patients operated on for both aneurysmal and occlusive disease (2600 versus 2195 ml and 2105 versus 1344 ml respectively). 
Continuous venovenous hemofiltration in the management of acute decompensation in inborn errors of metabolism. Continuous venovenous hemofiltration was used to treat two neonates, one with maple syrup urine disease and the other with an inborn error of long-chain fatty acid oxidation. The latter infant had hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia and lactic acidosis. In both cases, acceptable biochemical control was achieved within 8 hours. This therapy offers the potential to overcome acute crises rapidly in a wide range of inborn errors of intermediary metabolism. 
Immunocytochemical detection of kappa and lambda light chain V region subgroups in human B-cell malignancies. We have used a sensitive immunoperoxidase method and highly specific anti-light chain antisera to determine the light chain variable region (VL) subgroup nature of cytoplasmic (c) and cell surface (s) Ig expressed by human monoclonal plasma cells and B lymphocytes. The immunocytochemical characterization of cIg and sIg used antisera specific for the established kappa light chain V kappa subgroups (V kappa I, V kappa II, V kappa III, and V kappa IV) and the lambda light chain V lambda subgroups (V lambda I, V lambda II/V, V lambda IV, and V lambda VI). Studies were performed using cytospin preparations of bone marrow-, peripheral blood-, and lymph node-derived cells from patients with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis AL, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and with low-, mid-, and high-grade B-cell malignancies. The V kappa or V lambda subgroup of the cIg or sIg also could be identified after deparaffinization and enzyme treatment of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens. For those patients who had monoclonal serum or urinary Igs, there was complete concordance between the VL subgroup of the secreted Ig and that of the cIg or sIg. The percentage distribution of V kappa or V lambda subgroups on the sIg of cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and other cytomorphologic types of B-cell malignancies differed from that found for kappa- or lambda-type Bence Jones proteins obtained from patients with multiple myeloma, amyloidosis AL, and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. In contrast to the plasma cell and lymphocytoid plasma cell diseases, a relative predominance of certain VL subgroups, ie, V kappa IV, V lambda III, and V lambda IV, and the absence of the amyloid-associated V lambda VI subgroup were found in CLL and related diseases. The immunocytochemical techniques used make possible a rapid means to demonstrate B-cell monoclonality and provide further evidence for the selective expression of certain VL genes in human B-cell neoplasia. 
Improvement in oxygen tensions and pulmonary blood flow with intermittent distal aortic compression during normoxia, hypoxic hypoxia, and hyperoxia in neonatal piglets. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We investigated the hypothesis that, in a newborn piglet during normoxia, hypoxia, and hyperoxia, increasing aortic pressure transiently by intermittent short-duration aortic compression would affect left-to-right shunting of blood and thus increase pulmonary artery blood flow, pulmonary arterial PO2, and aortic PO2 proximal to the point of compression. We also investigated whether a balloon atrial septostomy, by providing an open channel for communication between the right- and left-sided circulations, would further improve pulmonary blood flow and aortic PO2. Studies were performed in eight 7- to 10-day-old newborn piglets in three phases (FIO2 of 0.21, 0.12, and 1.0) before and after balloon arterial septostomy in each piglet. Blood gas measurements and hemodynamic variables were recorded before and at the end of a 30-sec period of aortic compression. RESULTS: During aortic compression, all the animals demonstrated a 50 to 70 mm Hg increase in aortic pressure proximal to the compression. Before balloon septostomy, there were 21%, 41%, and 8% increases in aortic PO2 in the room air, hypoxic, and hyperoxic phases of the experiment, respectively. There were also statistically significant increments in pulmonary blood flow and arterial pressures. After balloon septostomy, there were 35%, 25%, and 21% increments in aortic PO2 during the room air, hypoxic, and hyperoxic phases of the experiment, respectively. However, there was no statistically significant further improvement in the effects of aortic compression on PO2 with septostomy compared with those effects before septostomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increasing systemic arterial pressures in order to forcibly affect left-to-right shunting of blood may be potentially beneficial in the management of hypoxia in situations where low pulmonary artery blood flow may be contributing to hypoxia, e.g., in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. 
Thromboembolism prophylaxis. Choosing the proper method for surgical patients. The primary care physician can play a major role in preoperative consultation in terms of assisting the surgical team to reduce the risk of thromboembolism. A preoperative risk assessment takes into account the type and duration of surgery as well as the existence of risk factors such as age and underlying medical conditions. With careful communication, the consulting physician and surgical team can together select a method of preventing thromboembolism that will prove both safe and effective. 
Comparison of effects of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular function in patients over with those under 60 years of age. This study examined the effect of age on left ventricular (LV) function, assessed by contrast ventriculography 3 weeks after a first acute myocardial infarction in 312 patients who received thrombolytic therapy within 4 hours of the onset of infarction and in 83 patients who received placebo. Streptokinase was given to 188 patients and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to 124. Patients were divided into 2 age groups: less than 60 years (n = 244) and greater than or equal to 60 years (n = 151). Thrombolytic therapy improved ejection fraction in both age groups: from 54 +/- 13 to 59 +/- 11% (p = 0.021) in the younger group and from 50 +/- 14 to 57 +/- 13% (p = 0.004) in the older group. Ejection fraction was identical in streptokinase- and rt-PA-treated patients. Multifactor analysis of variance revealed that younger age and thrombolytic therapy were independently associated with improved ejection fraction. Thrombolytic therapy also reduced end-systolic volume (p = 0.001) by 14 ml in the elderly and 9 ml in the younger group. Minor bleeding complications were more frequent in the elderly and 3 serious hemorrhages occurred in patients greater than or equal to 60 years. These findings reveal that thrombolysis improves LV function in all age groups studied. Because increasing age is independently associated with a lower ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction, thrombolytic therapy may confer greater benefits in older patients. 
Tubal occlusion after inguinal hernia repair. A case report. Midtubal occlusion and infertility occurred subsequent to an inguinal hernia repair. Recognition of the traumatic etiology is important because other causes of midtubal obstruction, such as endometriosis, tuberculosis and adenomatoid tumor of the oviduct, may be considered contraindications to reconstructive surgery. Once recognized, the condition is highly amendable to microsurgical reconstruction. 
HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 subfractions, and the risk of acute myocardial infarction. A prospective population study in eastern Finnish men. BACKGROUND. We investigated the association of cholesterol concentrations in serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) and its subfractions HDL2 and HDL3 with the risk of acute myocardial infarction in 1,799 randomly selected men 42, 48, 54, or 60 years old. METHODS AND RESULTS. Baseline examinations in the Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study were done during 1984-1987. In Cox multivariate survival models adjusted for age and examination year, serum HDL cholesterol of less than 1.09 mmol/l (42 mg/dl) was associated with a 3.3-fold risk of acute myocardial infarction (95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.7-6.4), serum HDL2, cholesterol of less than 0.65 mmol/l (25 mg/dl) was associated with a 4.0-fold risk of acute myocardial infarction (95% CI, 1.9-8.3), and serum HDL3 cholesterol of less than 0.40 mmol/l (15 mg/dl) was associated with a 2.0-fold (95% CI, 1.1-4.0) risk of acute myocardial infarction. Adjustments for obesity, ischemic heart disease, other cardiovascular disease, maximal oxygen uptake, systolic blood pressure, antihypertensive medication, serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations reduced the excess risks associated with serum HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol in the lowest quartiles by 52%, 48%, and 41%, respectively. Additional adjustments for alcohol consumption, cigarettes smoked daily, smoking years, and leisure time energy expenditure reduced these excess risks associated with low HDL, HDL2, and HDL3 cholesterol levels by another 26%, 24% and 21%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Our data confirm that both total HDL and HDL2 levels have inverse associations with the risk of acute myocardial infarction and may thus be protective factors in ischemic heart disease, whereas the role of HDL3 remains equivocal. 
Unilateral pulmonary oedema of the contralateral lung following transaxillary sympathectomy. A previously healthy young male developed unilateral pulmonary oedema immediately after re-expansion of an intentionally collapsed lung after transaxillary sympathectomy. The pulmonary oedema was localised to the contralateral, uncollapsed lung. 
Calcium metabolism and dietary calcium in salt sensitive hypertension. Evidence has accumulated over the past decade that suggests a relationship between low calcium intake, abnormalities in cation metabolism and hypertension in certain segments of the essential hypertension population. This evidence has been developed from epidemiological data, calcium intervention trials and observations related to biochemical alterations suggestive of a calcium deficiency in certain patients with hypertension and in animal models of essential hypertension. It is becoming increasingly evident that salt sensitive individuals are especially likely to be characterized by abnormalities of calcium metabolism and blood pressure responses to dietary calcium. In this review the role of calcium in the regulation of blood pressure is examined with an emphasis on epidemiological, biochemical, hemodynamic and dietary intervention data in the salt sensitive hypertensive patient. 
Epidemiology of acute rheumatic fever in a multiethnic, multiracial urban community: the Miami-Dade County experience. During the mid-1980s, several US communities experienced outbreaks of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), often involving predominantly white, middle-class individuals living in suburban or rural settings. The medical records of all patients diagnosed with ARF in Miami-Dade County, Florida, between 1984 and 1988 were reviewed. Thirty-five cases met the revised Jones criteria and were considered definite; four additional cases were classified as probable. Carditis was present in 54%. Of the 39 patients, 32 (82%) were black. The annual incidence of ARF among black children aged 5-14 years was 12.25 per 100,000 compared to 0.71 for other (non-Hispanic white plus Hispanic) children (P less than .001). ARF was centered in the inner city, where the incidence among black children reached 15.21. Despite the multiethnic, multiracial character of Miami-Dade County and the rapid influx of immigrants, ARF in this community remains primarily a disease of underprivileged, black inner-city children. 
The role of platelet activating factor and its antagonists in shock, sepsis and multiple organ failure. PAF has been implicated as a mediator of shock, sepsis and MOF. The results of experimental data demonstrate that PAF induces changes characteristic of endotoxemia and sepsis, including systemic hypotension and diffuse microvascular leakage. These effects are prevented by PAF antagonists. PAF induces many of the characteristic changes of MOF, including functional impairment in the lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract and heart. PAF antagonists will inhibit these adverse effects. PAF antagonists are now being manufactured by a number of pharmaceutical companies studying the beneficial effects of PAF antagonists in human disease. Data from these studies promise valuable information with significant clinical relevance to the practicing surgeon. 
Prevalence and malignant potential of colorectal polyps in asymptomatic, average-risk men. Screening colonoscopy was performed on 119 asymptomatic elderly men with no other risk factors for colonic neoplasms. Ninety adenomas were detected in 49 (41%) subjects. Mean adenoma size was 6.5 mm, with 83 (92%) less than or equal to 10 mm. Forty-nine (54%) adenomas were located proximal to the splenic flexure, and 17 (19%) were classified as tubulovillous or villous. Moderate- to high-grade dysplasia was found in 29 (32%) adenomas and was associated with larger size (p less than 0.0001) and villous architecture (p = 0.0038). Two subjects harbored adenomas with invasive cancer. Seventy-one hyperplastic polyps were found in 40 (34%) subjects. The mean size of hyperplastic polyps was 3.4 mm, and 64 (90%) were located in the left colon. We conclude that, in this population, adenomas are common lesions that are frequently small. However, substantial proportions of these adenomas may be at risk for malignant degeneration due to the presence of villous architecture and higher grades of dysplasia. Because adenomas and hyperplastic polyps are endoscopically indistinguishable, all polyps found at endoscopy should be removed or ablated. 
Large molecular form of serum HBeAg in chronic hepatitis B virus infection: relation to liver cell damage. We have separated circulating HBeAg into small and large molecular forms by agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed the relationship between the two forms and other clinical features of chronic hepatitis B, especially in regard to liver cell damage. The large HBeAg accounted for 7.3% +/- 3.4% of serum HBeAg in 9 subjects with normal liver histological findings or nonspecific reactive hepatitis, 38.0% +/- 27.8% in 32 patients with chronic persistent hepatitis and 65.6% +/- 23.3% in 21 patients with chronic active hepatitis (p less than 0.01). A positive correlation was seen between the height of aminotransferase elevations and the percentage of large HBeAg. Three patients who progressed from histologically normal liver or nonspecific reactive hepatitis to chronic active hepatitis had dramatic increases in the percentage of large HBeAg. The finding that the presence of large HBeAg in serum correlated with the severity of hepatitis suggests that HBeAg may play an important role in determining the degree of liver injury in chronic hepatitis B. 
Flecainide acetate prevents recurrence of symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The Flecainide Supraventricular Tachycardia Study Group Oral flecainide acetate was administered to 34 patients with documented symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8-week crossover trial design. PSVT was defined as a regular tachycardia of at least 120 beats/min without evidence of atrioventricular dissociation. The study required considerable patient cooperation. Patients first entered a 4-week qualifying phase followed by a 3-week, open label, flecainide dose-ranging phase. They were then randomized in a blind fashion to receive either placebo or tolerated flecainide dose for an 8-week treatment period and then crossed over after four symptomatic documented episodes of PSVT or at the end of the treatment period. By all efficacy parameters analyzed, flecainide was superior to placebo. Flecainide was associated with an actuarial 79% freedom from symptomatic PSVT events compared with only 15% on placebo at 60 days (p less than 0.001). Of the 34 patients, 29 had recurrence of symptomatic PSVT at least once during the placebo phase; only eight patients had a recurrence during the flecainide phase (p less than 0.001). The median time to the first symptomatic PSVT event was 11 days in the placebo group and greater than 55 days in the flecainide group (p less than 0.001). Likewise, the interval between attacks was a median of 12 days on placebo compared with more than 55 days on flecainide (p less than 0.001). Finally, the flecainide slowed symptomatic PSVT heart rates to 143 +/- 12 beats/min from 178 +/- 12 on placebo (p less than 0.02) in the seven patients who had events in the placebo and flecainide treatment phases. 
Laser laparoscopic vagotomy and pyloromyotomy. We performed bilateral truncal vagotomy and gastric drainage procedure using standard laparoscopic instruments in five mongrel dogs. The procedure consisted of a transthoracic thoracoscopic bilateral truncal vagotomy and transperitoneal laparoscopic pyloromyotomy. A contact Nd:YAG laser fiber was used. There was no mortality, minimal morbidity, and post-operative gastric emptying was satisfactory. Pathologic studies indicated vagotomy was complete. We believe that this may be the initial step in the development of a simple, safe, and effective endoscopic procedure for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. 
Relation of stenosis resolution pressure to long-term clinical outcome after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Variables associated with a poor long-term prognosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) include a short duration of symptoms before PTCA, unstable angina and the presence of thrombus at the PTCA site. These imply a component of transient or dynamic obstruction as opposed to a pure fixed obstruction. It is postulated that resolution pressure (i.e., the pressure at which complete balloon inflation occurs) may also correlate with prognosis after successful PTCA. In 173 consecutive patients undergoing successful, elective, single-lesion PTCA, 48 (28%) were found to have narrowings that resolved at less than or equal to 2 atm (group 1) and 125 (72%) were found to have narrowings resolved at greater than 2 atm (group 2). There were no significant differences in baseline, anatomic or procedural variables between the 2 groups, except that angiographic coronary dissection occurred in 17% of group 1 patients versus 40% of group 2 patients (p less than 0.007). During a mean follow-up of 12.0 +/- 6.1 months, the incidence of cardiac events (repeat PTCA, coronary artery bypass grafting or myocardial infarction) was 29% in group 1 versus 15% in group 2 (p less than 0.05). The overall incidence of angina was similar between the groups (25 vs 28%), but Canadian Cardiovascular Association class 4 angina occurred significantly more frequently in group 1 than group 2 (21 vs 8%) (p less than 0.04). These data suggest that a low resolution pressure is associated with a higher incidence of unstable angina and recurrent cardiac events during follow-up than higher resolution pressures. 
Pharmacologic therapy for fetal arrhythmias. Although great strides have been made in diagnosing fetal cardiac anatomic and functional abnormalities, in utero cardiac therapy is limited to the treatment of significant arrhythmias. The fetal prognosis may change if the dysrhythmia persists or if the condition results in intrauterine heart failure. When either complication is evident, intrauterine drug therapy may be indicated if the fetus is considered too immature for delivery. Information from case reports has shown several drugs to be useful to cardiovert the fetus, with digitalis being the pharmacologic agent used most often. At present, treatment consists mainly of transplacental administration of antiarrhythmic agents with the object of normalizing FHR and rhythm and abolishing, or preventing, fetal cardiac failure. Various agents have been used with variable success. More direct fetal therapy by intramuscular injection or umbilical vein infusion may replace unsuccessful indirect maternal therapy. It is unclear why some fetuses respond (or appear to respond) and others have hydrops and die in the absence of congenital heart disease or documented infection. With proper therapy, many fetuses survive and have a satisfactory prognosis, depending on the form of arrhythmia and the nature of any cardiac structural defects. 
The stratification of cardiac surgical procedures according to use of blood products: a retrospective analysis of 1480 cases. The use of blood products in 1480 consecutive cases of adult cardiac surgical procedures over a period of 15 mth was studied retrospectively using the database of the Department of Anaesthesia of the Institut de Cardiologie de Montreal. Use of blood products was compared in patients having (1) coronary artery bypass grafting, (2) valvular surgery, (3) or a combination of 1 and 2. First operations were compared with reoperations. Overall, the use of homologous blood products was greatest in patients of Group 3, intermediate in patients of Group 2, and smallest in patients of Group 1. Reoperations were associated with an increase in intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells, but postoperative chest drainage was similar to first operations. When all blood products (packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelets) were taken into consideration, patients undergoing primary CABG or valve surgery were the least exposed to homologous blood donors (five and six units transfused respectively). Repeat CABG was associated with an intermediate exposure to homologous blood products (eight units). Finally, primary and repeat combined procedures, and repeat valve surgery were associated with the greatest exposure to foreign blood products (10, 13 and 10 units respectively). The data presented in this study provide a rational basis for stratification of procedures according to the expected use of blood products, particularly in view of future studies which may be planned to examine the efficiency of blood conservation strategies. 
Abnormal blood pressure response to exercise in borderline hypertension. A two year follow-up study. Twenty-eight men with borderline hypertension according to the World Health Organization criteria underwent maximal exercise testing, and then were followed for a two year period. The prevalence of abnormal blood pressure behavior during exercise was 53.58% (n = 15). During follow-up established hypertension developed in 63.33% (n = 10) of subjects with an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise, and only in 15% (n = 2) of subjects with normal blood pressure behavior. In predicting established hypertension development in a two year follow-up, maximal exercise testing has the following statistical values: sensitivity = 83.33%, specificity = 68.75%, accuracy = 75%, positive predictive value = 66.66%, negative predictive value = 84.61%. 
Neo-adjuvant (pre-emptive) cisplatin therapy in invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Following 2 pilot studies which showed 57 and 61% response rates to intravenous cisplatin for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder prior to definitive treatment, the West Midlands Urological Research Group (WMURG) and the Australian Bladder Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) independently began randomised trials to test the survival benefit of neo-adjuvant intravenous cisplatin prior to radiotherapy in T2-T4 M0 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Both trials failed to recruit their target numbers of 250 patients in the West Midlands and 320 in Australia. Since they had similar treatment protocols and eligibility criteria, they were combined in an overview analysis, achieving a total number of 255 patients. Each treatment group was compared with its own control group and the differences were pooled to give an overall result. There was no difference in survival between treated and control patients. The odds ratio was 1.13 with the control groups faring marginally better than the chemotherapy groups. Even with 255 patients the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio was wide (0.80-1.57). Although there is no clear evidence of a clinically worthwhile benefit from neo-adjuvant cisplatin, this approach must be tested in a larger study using combination treatments with greater activity in metastatic disease. 
Coronary capillaries in patients with congestive cardiomyopathy or angina pectoris with patent main coronary arteries. Ultrastructural morphometry of endomyocardial biopsy samples. BACKGROUND. The coronary microvasculature may be abnormal even in the presence of angiographically normal epicardial arteries. Abnormalities of small coronary vessels have been invoked as a cause of angina. METHODS AND RESULTS. To quantitatively evaluate the morphology of capillaries in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or the syndrome of angina and small vessel disease (SVD), we performed electron microscopic morphometry of capillaries in right ventricular biopsy samples taken from 32 patients. Ten had angina, normal epicardial coronary arteries, and evidence for SVD; 12 had DCM; and 10 had normal hearts. In patients with DCM, the ratio of microvessels to myocytes was not different than that of controls (0.49 +/- 0.06 versus 0.51 +/- 0.05). Mean cross-sectional areas of the capillaries (lumen plus wall) and lumen were significantly greater than those of controls (45.3 +/- 15.1 versus 22.7 +/- 8.3 micron 2, p less than 0.001; 17.6 +/- 6.9 versus 11.6 +/- 6.2 micron 2, p less than 0.05, respectively). Fibrous content of the myocardium, as assessed by quantitative light microscopy, was significantly increased (16.3 +/- 3.3% versus 5.0 +/- 2.4%, p less than 0.001). In contrast, in patients with SVD, the capillary-to-myocyte ratio was reduced (0.33 +/- 0.08, p less than 0.001). Although mean cross-sectional areas of the entire capillary (32.4 +/- 19.7 micron 2) and the lumen (8.9 +/- 7.8 micron 2) were not statistically different than those of controls, there was an absence of capillaries less than 15 micron 2 in cross-sectional area, and the frequency distribution of the lumen area was skewed to the left. Swollen endothelial cells frequently encroached upon the lumen. There was a mild increase in fibrous content (9.5 +/- 3.7%, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS. Enlarged capillaries and a normal ratio of capillaries to myocytes appear to be features of DCM. Of the patients with SVD, there was both a relative lack of capillaries and capillary lumen narrowing from swollen endothelium. These changes may induce ischemia and angina and may result in mild fibrosis. 
Ectopic pituitary adenoma in the suprasellar cistern: case report. The case of a 56-year-old man with an ectopic pituitary adenoma is reported. Neurological examinations, neurodiagnostic imaging, surgical observation, endocrinological evaluation, histological examination, and immunohistological study demonstrated evidence of ectopic prolactinoma in the suprasellar cistern and the presence of a normal pituitary in the sella turcica. The patient underwent total removal of the suprasellar mass by a pterional approach, leading to a surgical and endocrinological cure. 
Basal ganglia mass lesions in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. A 2-year-old boy suffered aphasia, hypotonia, dystonia, and loss of activity and spontaneous speech during an active stage of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis with pericarditis, fever, anemia, and a high antinuclear antibody titer. These neurologic signs slowly improved with corticosteroid treatment but fluctuated over 1 year. The neuroimaging studies revealed irregular mass lesions in the basal ganglia bilaterally mainly involving the globus pallidus. They gradually decreased in size and almost disappeared after 1 year. A stereotactic brain biopsy revealed a slight proliferation of astrocytes. Chorioretinitis was also observed during the clinical course. A chronic inflammatory process involving cerebral vessels was suspected, although angiography did not demonstrate cerebral vasculitis. The possibility of central nervous system lymphoma could not be eliminated. The type of aphasia and the relation to the lesion sites are discussed. 
Dysmegakaryopoiesis resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in treated acute myeloid leukemia. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by trilineage dysplasia, including atypical megakaryocytes. Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (FAB M7) is particularly associated with atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia (AMH). Fifteen patients with nonmegakaryoblastic AML developed AMH after therapy, comprising 12.6% of cases of AML diagnosed from 1986 to 1989. Platelet counts were normal in nine patients and decreased in six. Blasts comprised less than 5% of cells in 40% of the biopsies, ranged from 5-15% in 53%, and comprised more than 30% of cells in 7%. Numerous small hypo- and hyperlobated megakaryocytes were seen in all specimens, often occurring in clusters, and were more easily seen in sections than in smears. Subsequent biopsies in 13 patients showed a remission marrow in seven, increased blasts in three, and AML in three; none showed AMH. AMH resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia may be seen transiently after treatment of AML. 
Bilateral cerebellopontine angle tumors in neurofibromatosis type 2. In a series of over 500 cases of cerebellopontine angle tumors, 19 patients had bilateral neurinomas. Four of these tumors arose from the facial rather than the acoustic nerve. A conservative policy regarding surgery had been adopted in an effort to prevent hearing loss for as long as possible. Nevertheless, all patients operated on in this series are now totally deaf. The results of managing these patients surgically and conservatively are discussed. 
Oestrogen receptor D5 antibody is an independent negative prognostic factor in gastric cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated oestrogen receptors in tissues other than those considered to be sex hormone responsive, for instance in gastric cancer. In vitro experiments have shown oestradiol to be trophic to gastric cancer cell lines. The effect of D5 (an oestrogen receptor-related protein) status on survival was therefore studied in a group of 188 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for gastric cancer. Ninety-two patients (49 per cent) were positive for the D5 antibody. There were no differences between the D5-positive and D5-negative groups for age or adverse prognostic features such as high grade tumours or advanced stage. The D5-negative patients had a significant survival advantage over the D5-positive patients. The 95 per cent confidence interval for survival in the patients with D5-negative tumours was 63-101 weeks compared with 39-66 weeks for the patients with D5-positive tumours (Mantel-Cox statistic = 4.15, P = 0.042). Prognostic factor analysis with a Cox proportional hazards model showed tumour stage (P = 0.001) and D5 status (P = 0.003) to be significant independent factors in gastric cancer. Lauren type, grade and gender were not significant independent factors in this small series. 
A modified neoglottis procedure: update and analysis. In recent years, various techniques have been introduced for construction of an epithelium-lined shunt between the trachea and the esophagus or hypopharynx. We described a rigid neoglottis in a preliminary report of 12 cases in which the upper tracheal rings were used to construct the epithelium-lined tract. This study reports the cases of 22 additional patients and offers an in-depth analysis of additional demographics, complications, and long-term speech results that quantify the vocal characteristics of neoglottic speakers. Results indicate rapid postoperative speech rehabilitation in nearly all patients, good long-term speech results (mean followup, 52 months), and low morbidity. There was a low incidence of local recurrence and stenosis, and 26 of 34 patients had either no aspiration or occasional asymptomatic aspiration of small amounts of liquid. This modified neoglottis procedure should be considered for patients who need voice restoration after laryngectomy. 
Intracellular calcium transients and arrhythmia in isolated heart cells. Intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) elevation may mediate cardiac arrhythmias. However, direct measurement of the rapid alterations of [Ca2+]i on a beat-to-beat basis using fast temporal resolution and without signal averaging in the spontaneously beating in vivo heart is lacking. Furthermore, data from an isolated spontaneously beating myocyte preparation that develops arrhythmia similar to that in the in vivo heart are unavailable. We measured rapid changes of [Ca2+]i with fast temporal resolution in isolated spontaneously beating neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with cell-to-cell communication and characterized the interrelation between [Ca2+]i and arrhythmia. An elevated extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o) concentration of 10.8 mM induced premature beats, a rapid beating rate (tachyarrhythmia), and chaotic or fibrillatory beating activity in a small group of myocytes. [Ca2+]i levels during systole increased from the nanomolar to micromolar concentration range before arrhythmia development. Spontaneous oscillations of [Ca2+]i during diastole could evoke a spontaneous tachyarrhythmia. In the presence of [Ca2+]i elevation, a spontaneous tachyarrhythmia could induce severe [Ca2+]i overload. Reduction of [Ca2+]i with 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid AM (5 microM) in the presence of 10.8 mM [Ca2+]o reversed the arrhythmia. In single ventricular myocytes superfused with 10.8 mM [Ca2+]o, oscillations of membrane potential characteristic of transient inward current occurred that were prevented by ryanodine (0.1 microM), an inhibitor of Ca2+ flux across the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This study characterizes 1) an isolated multicellular myocyte model of arrhythmia similar to that evident in in vivo hearts, 2) elevation of [Ca2+]i with systolic [Ca2+]i levels of 1-3 microM and diastolic [Ca2+]i oscillations before the initiation of arrhythmia, 3) tachyarrhythmia as a cause of severe [Ca2+]i overload, which may be important in the perpetuation and degeneration of arrhythmias, and 4) reversal of arrhythmia with reduction of [Ca2+]i. The results in the isolated myocyte model may have relevance to the generation and perpetuation of certain cardiac arrhythmias associated with calcium overload. 
Quality assurance for patients with head injuries admitted to a regional trauma unit. The efficacy of trauma systems in reducing preventable deaths has been established but the methods of auditing care are still evolving. Various "audit filters" to identify which patients' charts should be reviewed have been proposed. An analysis of all patients admitted to the Regional Trauma Unit (RTU) over a 19-month period was conducted. Of 729 patients, 135 were identified as having suffered a traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (TICH). On review, neither delay in transfer from the emergency room to the operating room nor increasing time from the incident to the operating room correlated with increasing mortality. In contrast to delay, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission correlated well with outcome. The charts of patients with anomalous outcomes based on admission GCS score were reviewed, and two possibly preventable deaths were identified. There were 48 patients with TICH who had no operations but there were no deaths attributable to a missed operation. There were 76 patients for whom the GCS score at the referring hospital and the GCS score on admission to the RTU were available. Seven of 19 patients who worsened on transfer declined because of significant pulmonary injuries. Anomalous outcomes based on admission GCS score and declining GCS scores are recommended as quality assurance filters. 
Survival of patients with metastases from uveal melanoma. The authors evaluated a series of 145 consecutive patients with metastases from uveal melanoma, after proton beam irradiation, to assess the effect of early diagnosis and treatment for metastases on survival. Metastases were diagnosed between 7 weeks and 8.3 years (median, 2.4 years) after proton beam irradiation. Most patients (n = 94) were symptomatic before diagnosis; the remainder were first detected during screening examination. Liver involvement was documented in nearly all patients (n = 136). The majority of patients had died from metastases by the close of the study (n = 137). Significantly longer survival occurred among patients diagnosed during screening examination (P = 0.004) and among young patients (P = 0.03). The majority of patients received some form of treatment for metastases (69%). Median survival was 2.0 months for patients receiving no treatment compared with 5.2 months for those receiving treatment for metastases (P = .0001). However, the overall 1-year survival rate was poor (13%). Prophylactic adjuvant therapy could be explored as a means to increase disease-free survival in patients with uveal melanoma. 
Cardiac biopsy in patients with "primary" atrial fibrillation. Histologic evidence of occult myocardial diseases. Fourteen patients (ten men and four women; mean age, 37 years) with lone atrial fibrillation (AF) (1 to 18 months' duration) were evaluated by thyroid function tests, two-dimensional echocardiography, hemodynamics, coronary angiography, and left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, because of unresponsiveness to the usual antiarrhythmic therapy. The results of the T3, T4, TSH, and TRH tests were normal in all patients; cardiac valves and ventricular and atrial sizes (left atrium less than 40 mm) were within the normal limits; also normal were LVEDP (less than or equal to 10 mm Hg) and EF (greater than 0.50). Histologic findings were abnormal in all cases, with three patients showing cardiomyopathic changes, three other patients showing active myocarditis (lymphocytic in two and eosinophilic in one), and eight patients with nonspecific necrosis or fibrosis or both. Steroids (prednisone; 50 mg/m2 of body surface area daily) used in addition to antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with eosinophilic and lymphocytic active myocarditis were able to cause reversion to sinus rhythm, while the other patients continued to have AF. This study documents that occult myocardial diseases (myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and nonspecific necrosis or fibrosis) can underlie "primary" AF. The addition of steroids to antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with refractory AF and histologic evidence of active myocarditis seems to be useful in controlling the arrhythmia. 
Idiopathic scrotal calcinosis is idiopathic. The appearance of calcific masses within the dermis of scrotal skin is generally referred to as idiopathic scrotal calcinosis. There has been some debate about the pathogenesis of these calcium deposits. This debate centers on the question of whether the calcium deposition is truly idiopathic or whether it occurs as a result of preexisting epidermal cysts. We have performed immunohistochemical staining for keratin in nine patients with apparent idiopathic scrotal calcinosis and have found no evidence of keratin in the dermal tissue immediately adjacent to the calcium deposits. We conclude that idiopathic scrotal calcinosis is idiopathic. 
Benign familial neonatal convulsions: evidence for clinical and genetic heterogeneity. The gene for autosomal dominant "benign" familial neonatal convulsions, a transient, primary epilepsy of infancy, has recently been assigned to chromosome 20q. To determine whether this disorder is genetically heterogeneous, we performed linkage analysis in two previously unreported pedigrees with benign familial neonatal convulsions in which clinical heterogeneity was evident. There were 14 affected persons in the first family, and none had seizures (febrile or afebrile) after the age of 2 months. The second family had 13 affected individuals and 2 obligate carriers; seizures frequently did not remit until 6 to 24 months, febrile convulsions occurred in at least 2 patients, apparent audiogenic seizures occurred in 4 patients, and 1 individual had refractory epilepsy until late adolescence. Linkage studies with the chromosome 20 markers D20S19 and D20S20 were performed in both families. The resulting data favored linkage of the disease and marker loci in Family 2 by a maximum odds ratio of 45:1 at 6% recombination. In Family 1, however, the odds were greater than 20,000:1 against linkage at 10% recombination or less. We conclude that the syndrome of benign familial neonatal convulsions is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Further study will be necessary to clarify the relationship between phenotype and genotype in this disorder. 
Alterations in the levels of iron, ferritin and other trace metals in Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases affecting the basal ganglia. Levels of iron, copper, zinc and manganese were measured by inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy in frozen postmortem brain tissue from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy with strionigral degeneration (MSA), and Huntington's disease (HD) compared with control subjects. Total iron levels were found to be elevated in the areas of basal ganglia showing pathological change in these disorders. In particular, total iron content was increased in substantia nigra in PD, PSP and MSA, but not in HD. Total iron levels in the striatum (putamen and/or caudate nucleus) were increased in PSP, MSA and HD but not in PD. Total iron levels were decreased in the globus pallidus in PD. There were no consistent alterations of manganese levels in basal ganglia structures in any of the diseases studied. Copper levels were decreased in the substantia nigra in PD, and in the cerebellum in PSP, and were elevated in the putamen and possibly substantia nigra in HD. Zinc levels were only increased in PD, in substantia nigra and in caudate nucleus and lateral putamen. Levels of the iron binding protein ferritin were measured in the same patient groups using a radio-immunoassay technique. Increased iron levels in basal ganglia were generally associated with normal or elevated levels of ferritin immunoreactivity, for example, the substantia nigra in PSP and possibly MSA, and in putamen in MSA. The exception was PD where there was a generalized reduction in brain ferritin immunoreactivity, even in the substantia nigra. An increase in total iron content appears to be a response to neurodegeneration in affected basal ganglia regions in a number of movement disorders. However, only in PD was there an increased total iron level, decreased ferritin content, decreased copper content, and an increased zinc concentration in substantia nigra. These findings suggest an alteration of iron handling in the substantia nigra in PD. Depending on the form in which the excess iron load exists in nigra in PD, it may contribute to the neurodegenerative process. 
Identification of alloimmunized patients: use of radiolabeled allogeneic platelet kinetic measurements and platelet antibody tests. In a group of stable, nonthrombocytopenic leukemia patients awaiting bone marrow transplantation, results of paired allogeneic radiolabeled platelet kinetic measurements were correlated with the results of several different platelet and lymphocytotoxic antibody tests to determine which parameters could be used to identify patients who were alloimmunized to platelets. Seven patients with acute leukemia who had been transfused during induction therapy were used as the test group, and, as a control group, five untransfused patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia were also studied. Concurrent fibrinogen survival measurements were performed in all patients to assess whether hemostatic factor consumption (ie, disseminated intravascular coagulation) was present. Allogeneic platelet survival measurements were reduced from normal in all 12 study patients. In 8 of 12 patients, fibrinogen and platelet survival measurements were comparably reduced, suggesting disease-related platelet consumption. In four heavily transfused patients with acute leukemia, allogeneic platelet survivals were markedly reduced to less than or equal to 2.1 days, compared with the 3.5- to 7.4-day platelet survival measurements found in the other eight patients. The disproportionately short platelet survivals compared with fibrinogen survival measurements in these four patients, combined with documented positive antibody tests to their donors' platelets in the three patients with evaluable tests, suggested that these patients had become alloimmunized to platelets because of their prior transfusions. There was substantial concordance between the two radiolabeled allogeneic donor platelet survival measurements performed in each of these patients, suggesting that host rather than donor factors have a major influence on transfusion outcome (r = .93, P less than .001). The platelet cross-match tests, using the radiolabeled protein Staph A assay combined with the IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, had the best correlation with the posttransfusion recovery and survival of the donors' platelets. 
Non-trauma mortality in elderly women with low bone mineral density. Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group. 9704 ambulatory women aged 65 years or older were prospectively studied to determine whether low bone mineral density (osteopenia) was associated with mortality. Bone mineral density was measured at entry to the study by single-photon absorptiometry. 299 women died during a mean of 2.8 years' follow-up. Osteopenia was associated with increased non-trauma mortality, probably because it is a marker for several other adverse factors. Each standard deviation decrease in proximal radius bone mineral density (0.104 g/cm2) was associated with a 1.19-fold increase in mortality (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.36), adjusted for age and duration of follow-up. Diminished bone mineral density at the proximal radius was strongly associated with deaths from stroke (relative risk = 1.74; 95% CI 1.12-2.70), an association that was not confounded by history of previous stroke, hypertension, postmenopausal use of oestrogen, thiazide diuretic treatment, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Most deaths in women with low bone mineral density are unrelated to the occurrence of fractures-an observation that should be taken into account when estimating the need for and cost-effectiveness of bone-density screening and fracture prevention programmes. 
The risks of metastases from shunting in children with primary central nervous system tumors. The authors reviewed the hospital charts of 415 pediatric patients treated for benign or malignant primary brain tumors over the past 20 years at the Children's Hospital Medical Center, Seattle. Patients' ages ranged from the neonatal period to 18 years. A shunt was placed in 152 patients (37%), 45 before and 94 after surgery. Confirmation of extraneural metastases was based on clinical and diagnostic examination. Factors analyzed as possibly influencing the occurrence of extraneural metastases were: 1) the shunt: type, valve, location, filter, and revisions; 2) extent of resection; 3) pathology; and 4) treatment regimen. Eight of the 415 patients developed extraneural metastases during life. All eight patients had a medulloblastoma (cerebellar primitive neuroectodermal tumor). These eight patients were separated into Group A (without a shunt) and Group B (with a shunt). In Group A (five patients), the mean interval from primary diagnosis to metastasis was 15 months. Two children had gross total resection of the tumor. The predominant location of metastases in Group A was: bone (two cases); cervical lymph nodes (one); lung/bone (one); and retroperitoneal pelvic mass (one). Three Group A patients had a simultaneous central nervous system (CNS) recurrence. Of the three Group B patients, two had a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt and one a ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt; all were placed postoperatively. One Group B patient had a simultaneous CNS recurrence. No shunt revisions were performed in these three patients. The mean time from primary diagnosis to metastasis was 25 months. One patient had a total tumor resection. The predominant location of metastases was bone (one case), retroperitoneal pelvic mass (one), and abdominal cavity with ascites (one case). Only one patient in the entire series had a filter placed; this resulted in shunt obstruction and was removed 1 month following placement. It is concluded that cerebrospinal fluid shunts, regardless of type, location, revision rate, or filter insertion, do not predispose pediatric patients with brain tumors to develop extraneural metastases. A diagnosis of shunt-related metastases should be based on the development of intra-abdominal (VP shunt) or pulmonary (VA shunt) dissemination primarily with or without additional sites. The diagnosis of medulloblastoma is an important factor related to metastasis occurrence while the extent of resection and postoperative therapy are not influential. 
Prognostic factors in advanced head and neck cancer patients undergoing multimodality therapy. A retrospective analysis was performed to investigate potential prognostic factors for complete remission to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and overall survival in patients with previously untreated stage III and stage IV head and neck cancer. Eighty consecutive patients were treated in one of two studies investigating three or four courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Before local therapy and surgery and/or radiotherapy, 29% attained a complete remission. No strong significant and independent predictor of complete remission was identified. Only nodal stage (N) was found moderately associated with complete remission (p = 0.06). Node-negative patients had higher remission rates. Less important predictors were tumor stage (T) and site of disease; nasopharyngeal patients had superior remission rates (56%). With a median followup of 45 months and estimated 3-year survival rate of 38% (median 23.7 months), individual factors predictive of survival included pretherapy weight loss, performance status, alcohol use, pretherapy serum albumin level, site of disease, and N stage. In multivariate testing weight loss was identified as the strongest independent predictor of survival (p less than 0.0001) and surpassed other health status measures, such as performance status and serum albumin level. In addition, N stage (p = 0.019) and alcohol use (p = 0.017) were found to be predictive. A cross-classification by N stage and weight loss revealed risk groups with distinctly different prognoses, which may be useful for design and analysis in future trials. 
Hip disarticulation: factors affecting outcome. Hip disarticulation, especially in patients with peripheral vascular disease, has been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. This report describes patient characteristics that influence the clinical outcome of hip disarticulation. The medical records of all patients undergoing hip disarticulation from 1966 to 1989 were reviewed for surgical indication, perioperative wound complications, and postoperative deaths. Fifty-three patients underwent hip disarticulation for limb ischemia (10), infection (12), infection and ischemia (14), or tumor (17). The overall incidence of wound complications was 60%, and no significant differences were found among the groups. Prior above-knee amputation and urgent/emergent operations were significantly associated with increased wound complications (p less than 0.05). The overall mortality rate was 21%, ranging from 0% (tumor) to 50% (ischemia) and differed significantly among the groups (p less than 0.02). Mortality was significantly associated with urgent/emergent operations (p less than 0.01). Age, diabetes mellitus, and previous inflow procedures did not influence mortality rates. The presence of limb ischemia influenced mortality rates to a greater extent than did infection, and a history of cardiac disease was statistically predictive of death. Wound complications frequently accompanied hip disarticulation, regardless of operative indication, and were significantly increased by urgent/emergent operations and prior above-knee amputation. Hip disarticulation can be performed with low mortality rates in selected patients. Both limb ischemia and infection substantially increase operative mortality rates. 
Aspirin does not inhibit cholesterol cholelithiasis in two established animal models. The effect of aspirin on cholesterol cholelithiasis was examined in the hamster and the prairie dog. In the prairie dog, diets were composed of semipurified components of chow, plus cholesterol (1.2%), with and without aspirin. Animals were studied for either 2 weeks or 4 weeks. Cholesterol gallstones were present in all groups at the end of each period; aspirin did not alter the incidence of cholelithiasis. All animals studied had cholesterol crystals in the bile when they were killed. Liver cholesterol levels in prairie dogs with and without aspirin tended to be lower in animals fed chow than in animals fed semipurified diets. There were no significant differences in cholesterol levels in the plasma or bile. The cholesterol saturation index of all biles approached unity when animals were fed chow with aspirin; animals fed the semipurified diets had cholesterol saturation indices of less than 1.0. The prairie dogs fed aspirin plus cholesterol in the semipurified diet showed increased levels of biliary chenodeoxycholic acid amidates and concomitant decreased levels of cholic acid amidates compared with animals fed the same diet without aspirin. Hamsters fed aspirin plus cholesterol in a semipurified diet tended to have a greater incidence of gallstones than animals given no aspirin (80% vs. 55%). Liver and bile cholesterol levels were similar with and without aspirin; plasma cholesterol levels increased significantly with aspirin [14.20 vs. 7.80 mmol/L (549 vs. 301 mg/dL)]. Lithogenic indices in all hamsters were above unity; biliary lipids, total lipid concentration, and biliary bile acid composition were similar. These results show that the addition of aspirin to a lithogenic diet does not reduce the incidence of cholelithiasis. 
Abdominal aortic aneurysms complicated by spontaneous iliocaval or duodenal fistulae. Seven hundred and twenty one abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated between 1960 and 1985. Twenty one of these (2.9%) were complicated by the development of a spontaneous primary fistula, 16 (2.2%) into the vena cava or iliac veins and 5 (0.7%) into the duodenum. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only four instances, two aorto-caval and two aorto-duodenal fistulae. Hospital mortality was 44% for aorto-caval and 60% for aorto-duodenal fistulae. Despite the lack of a precise preoperative diagnosis in the majority of cases, the prognosis for aorto-caval fistula remained comparable to that for patients undergoing emergency surgery for uncomplicated ruptured aortic aneurysms. The mortality of spontaneous aorto-duodenal fistulae was appreciably higher and the aneurysmal contents of 4 out of these 5 cases had positive bacterial cultures. 
Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the renal pelvis producing alpha-fetoprotein of hepatic type and bile pigment. A right renal pelvic mass in a 72-year-old man was resected. The histologic appearance of the tumor was a mixture of tubular adenocarcinoma cells and hepatoid neoplastic cells, and there was a resemblance to hepatoid adenocarcinoma. The intraoperative level of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was calculated to be 2246 ng/ml, and the postoperative level ranges from 183.6 to 285.6 ng/ml. Lectin binding assays showed that the serum AFP was the hepatic carcinoma type. In a hepatoid portion, an iron-negative, brown to green pigment was positive for bile. Alpha-fetoprotein was immunohistochemically evident in the neoplastic cells. In addition to the hepatic differentiation, the tumor had differentiated into intestinal absorptive or pancreatobiliary tract cells, as deduced from the frequent presence of spicular bodies, a unique light microscopic feature equivalent to microvilli with an actin core. The hepatoid adenocarcinoma is a distinct type of AFP-producing carcinoma present in the organs with epithelium of endodermal origin. Hepatoid adenocarcinoma in the renal pelvis may arise from a metaplasia of neoplastic mesonephric cells into endodermal cells. 
Azoospermia: a complication of hydrocele repair in a fertile population. Although minor complications have been reported, hydrocelectomy generally is considered to be a safe procedure. We recently treated 3 patients who became azoospermic after hydrocele repair. Of the patients 2 underwent bilateral and 1 unilateral hydrocelectomy. All 3 patients had iatrogenic injury to the vas deferens or epididymis after hydrocele repair. 
Cholesterol screening and life assurance. OBJECTIVES--To examine how insurance companies assess proposals for life assurance from applicants with raised cholesterol concentrations and to determine the excess mortality rating applied. DESIGN--Survey of 49 companies underwriting term life assurance. SETTING--United Kingdom. SUBJECTS--Four fictional men aged 30 seeking 20 year term policies paying benefit only on death. Two had total cholesterol concentrations of 6.4 and 8.1 mmol/l but no other cardiovascular risk factors; one was overweight, hypertensive, smoked 20 cigarettes daily, and had a total cholesterol concentration of 8.1 mmol/l; and one had possible familial hypercholesterolaemia and a total cholesterol concentration of 10.7 mmol/l after treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Percentage excess mortality rating. RESULTS--All companies used explicit criteria to assess the mortality risk associated with hyperlipidaemias, and 47 companies applied the same criteria to men and women. No excess mortality rating was imposed on an applicant with a total cholesterol concentration of 6.4 mmol/l, but a small excess was applied to an applicant with a concentration of 8.1 mmol/l (median excess 50%, range 0-75%). When multiple cardiovascular risk factors were present the same concentration of 8.1 mmol/l resulted in a substantial excess (median 135%, range 50-200%). A smaller but more variable excess was applied to an applicant with possible familial hypercholesterolaemia (median 75%, range 0-200%). CONCLUSIONS--Despite considerable differences among companies in the excess mortality ratings applied, increases in term life assurance premiums are likely to be restricted to patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia, in particular those with familial hypercholesterolaemia. In the absence of other cardiovascular risk factors milder hypercholesterolaemia is unlikely to result in higher premiums. 
The coexistence of tics and dystonia. We studied nine patients with motor and phonic tics and other features of Tourette's syndrome, who developed persistent dystonia in addition to their tics. All, except one, were males (mean age, 35.8 years; range, 8 to 59 years), and had onset of tics prior to age 18 years (mean age, 9 years; range, 1.5 to 17 years). None of the patients were treated with neuroleptic drugs prior to the onset of dystonia. Torticollis and blepharospasm were the most common forms of dystonia. Seven patients had a history of tics in first degree relatives. While these patients were seen in a specialized movement disorder clinic and may, therefore, represent a population with atypical and more severe symptoms, the high prevalence rate of dystonia (5.0% of all patients with Tourette's syndrome seen in the clinic) suggests that some patients with tics may have an increased risk for dystonia. 
Cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin versus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin chemotherapy of ovarian carcinoma: a meta-analysis. The Ovarian Cancer Meta-Analysis Project. Four randomized clinical trials comparing cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin (CP) versus cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (CAP) individually failed to show a significant survival difference in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma. However, by pooling 1,194 patients from these trials in a meta-analysis, there is a statistically significant survival benefit for CAP (P = .02); in addition, there is a significant advantage for CAP in frequency of negative second-look laparotomy (CAP, 30%; CP, 23%; P = .01). Because the dose intensity of CAP was greater than CP in three of the trials, it remains unresolved to what extent the benefit of CAP is from greater dose intensity and to what extent it is from the doxorubicin itself. Either interpretation suggests directions for improving the chemotherapy of ovarian carcinoma. 
Response of newly established mouse myeloid leukemic cell lines to MC3T3-G2/PA6 preadipocytes and hematopoietic factors. Some mouse myeloid leukemias induced by X-irradiation and serially transplanted into syngenic mice do not proliferate in vitro even in the presence of hematopoietic factors. To examine whether such leukemic cells can proliferate in response to stromal cells, we cocultured them with MC3T3-G2/PA6 (PA6) preadipocytes, cells that can support the growth of hematopoietic stem cells. All leukemias developed into in vitro cell lines, showing a dependence on contact with the PA6 cells. Two cell lines responded to none of the known hematopoietic factors including interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, and Epo. These results demonstrate that the mechanism of the action of PA6 cells is different from that of any of the known hematopoietic factors, and that, because these two leukemic cell lines retained the ability to grow in vivo, responsiveness to the known hematopoietic factors is not essential for the leukemic cell growth in vivo. Furthermore, all leukemic cell lines could respond also to the preadipocytes fixed with formalin, paraformaldehyde, or glutaraldehyde, suggesting that some molecule(s) associated with the surface of PA6 cells or with extracellular matrix secreted by the preadipocytes is responsible for the leukemic cell growth. 
Causes of death in patients with tuberous sclerosis. Of the 355 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) examined at the Mayo Clinic, 49 had died (9 of causes other than TSC). We attempted to determine what pattern of organ involvement occurred most often in the 40 patients who died of TSC. One baby died of cardiac failure due to cardiac rhabdomyomas, and one child died of rupture of an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Eleven patients died of renal disease, which was the commonest cause of death. Ten patients died as a result of brain tumors, and four patients (who were 40 years of age or older) died of lymphangiomyomatosis of the lung. Thirteen patients with severe mental handicaps died of either status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia; in all but one of these patients, the only source of information was the death certificate. Survival curves show a decreased survival for patients with TSC in comparison with that for the general population. Patients with TSC need lifelong follow-up for early detection of potentially life-threatening complications. 
Syringoid eccrine carcinoma. Eccrine carcinomas are locally aggressive and have an infiltrative growth pattern. They have a variable clinical appearance and a diversity of histologic findings that often make the diagnosis difficult. The histologic findings, together with immunoperoxidase and enzyme histochemical studies, usually allow differentiation between eccrine carcinomas, other cutaneous neoplasms, and visceral adenocarcinomas with skin metastases. Provided there is no evidence of distant metastases, surgical excision is the treatment of choice. We report a case of syringoid eccrine carcinoma that was treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. 
Reinforced sternal closure. A technique of reinforced sternal closure with stainless steel struts is described. Stable sternum avoids severe complications such as mediastinitis and sternal dehiscence. 
Recurrent varicella-zoster virus infections in apparently immunocompetent children. Fourteen generally healthy children (5 females, 9 males, ages 18 months to 13 years) who have developed 2 to 5 attacks of chickenpox are described. Herpes zoster also occurred in 2 of 14 children. No case of chickenpox was severe or associated with complications. General studies of immunoglobulins, specific antibodies to immunization agents, complement and lymphocyte subpopulation number and function indicated that 1 of 14 had low serum IgA and 3 of 14 lacked antibody to 1 (n = 2) or 2 (n = 1) immunization agents. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific immune studies showed that the children developed VZV-antibody titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of 1:640 to 1:10 240. By immunoblot assay all appeared to develop a normal spectrum of antibodies to individual VZV proteins. All but one developed VZV cellular immune responses with stimulation indices ranging from 3.6 to 174. Sequential follow-up of 8 patients revealed 1 who became seronegative and 2 who lost VZV cell-mediated immune responses. Chickenpox may recur more frequently than is generally recognized. General and VZV-specific immune investigations are unlikely to indicate a reason. 
Cervical implantation metastasis by endometrial adenocarcinoma. A distinct type of cervical involvement by endometrial cancer is reported and termed cervical implantation metastasis. It is believed to result from implantation of endometrial cancer on the denuded endocervix after fractional dilatation and curettage (D & C). The histologic criteria for diagnosis are: (1) the cervical implantation metastasis must be imbedded in the endocervical epithelium or superficial stroma surrounded by an implantation site of inflammatory cells and granulation tissue (free-floating cancer cells above the cervical mucosa are not acceptable as implantation tissue), (2) the histologic findings of the cervical implantation metastasis must be similar to those of the endometrial adenocarcinoma in the uterine corpus, (3) the cervical implantation metastasis must be separate from the primary tumor with no evidence of direct extension, and (4) the cervical implantation metastasis should be surrounded by nonneoplastic endocervical glands with no transition between the two. Of the 176 patients who underwent fractional D & C before hysterectomy, nine (5%) were found to have cervical implantation metastasis. No patients had cervical implantation metastasis who did not undergo fractional D & C before hysterectomy. When stratified according to stage, grade, and myometrial invasion, there was no statistically significant difference in the recurrence rate between patients with or without cervical implantation metastasis. It appears that cervical implantation metastasis does not alter prognosis or require specific treatment. 
Thoracic outlet syndrome caused by tumor of the first rib. We report a new case of thoracic outlet syndrome caused by a tumor of the first rib and review 11 other reports found in the literature. A 25-year-old man was admitted with thoracic outlet syndrome in the C8-T1 nerve roots. The first rib was removed through a supraclavicular approach with excision of the medial clavicle. All symptoms disappeared. On histologic examination fibrous dysplasia was found in the rib. Tumors of the first rib are uncommon and are rarely responsible for thoracic outlet syndrome. When the tumor is very large, as in our case, we recommend a supraclavicular approach associated with excision of the medial clavicle. During the liberation of the brachial plexus, great care should be exercised to avoid nerve injuries. Because malignancy of the tumor cannot be eliminated with certainty before or during the operation, wide excision of the entire rib is recommended. 
Costs and health consequences of cholesterol screening for asymptomatic older Americans. To predict the consequences of cholesterol screening among elderly Americans who do not have symptoms of heart disease, we explore the cost implications of a cholesterol screening program, evaluate evidence linking hypercholesterolemia to coronary heart disease and mortality in the elderly, and describe the likely effects of therapy of hypercholesterolemia. According to our calculations, if all Americans 65 years of age and older adhered to a cholesterol screening program similar to the one proposed by the National Cholesterol Education Program, minimum annual expenditures for screening and treatment would be between $1.6 billion and $16.8 billion, depending on the effectiveness of diet and the cost of the medications used to treat hypercholesterolemia. There is no direct evidence that this program would lessen overall morbidity or extend the lives of elderly Americans. 
Osteoid osteoma: CT-guided percutaneous treatment. Seven patients with presumed osteoid osteoma were treated with percutaneous destruction or drill resection with computed tomographic (CT) guidance. The diagnosis of osteoid osteoma was made on the basis of findings in the clinical history and results at plain radiography, bone scintigraphy, and CT. In four patients, histologic confirmation was obtained. Hospital stay lasted from 1 to 3 days. After 11-38 months of follow-up examinations, all patients were asymptomatic. The authors report this simple procedure as an alternative to the more traditional open surgery technique. 
Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome: megalencephaly and heterotopic gray matter. A 3-month-old white male with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS), facial deformities, brain malformations, and cortical blindness is presented. Facial deformities included left ear hypertrophy and a left-sided hamartomatous neck mass. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested that a central nervous system (CNS) abnormality, involving gray and white matter, should be linked with LNSS. Magnetic resonance imaging was more useful than computed tomography in demonstrating the full spectrum of CNS anomalies, including unilateral lissencephaly, a paucity of white matter, excessive and heterotopic gray matter, apparent left schizencephaly, and unilateral left colpocephaly (dilation of atrium and posterior horn of lateral ventricle). Postmortem examination revealed left hemisphere megalencephaly with a dilated posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The impressive gray matter heterotopias likely were the source of the patient's seizures and perhaps the ultimate cause of death. Megalencephaly and other deviations of neuronal migration should be considered as a dramatic component of LNSS. 
New potent verapamil derivatives that reverse multidrug resistance in human renal carcinoma cells and in transgenic mice expressing the human MDR1 gene. Multidrug resistance in human renal cell carcinoma is mainly caused by expression of the MDR1 gene and is characterized by a broad spectrum cross resistance to many natural product chemotherapeutic agents. This resistance can be overcome by applying chemosensitizers which inhibit the function of the MDR1 gene product P-glycoprotein. The development of new reversing agents with fewer side effects and a higher potency in modifying resistance is a high priority of research on drug resistance. We have evaluated four new verapamil derivatives on 21 primary human renal cell carcinomas in vitro, and also tested them in an MDR-transgenic mice model. These mice express the human MDR1 gene in their bone marrow cells and measurement of their white blood counts provides a simple, rapid and reliable system to screen for the potency of MDR-reversing agents in vivo. We demonstrate here that all four drugs are effective in reversing multidrug resistance in primary cultures of human renal cell carcinomas when used in combination with vinblastine chemotherapy, and to a lesser extent with doxorubicin or daunomycin chemotherapy. Our in vivo data indicate that two of these reversing agents display low toxicity at high concentrations and are more effective at low, clinically achievable concentrations, than the other two drugs and R-verapamil. These results make the two new drugs attractive candidates to be taken into clinical trials. 
Regulation of cerebral blood vessels by humoral and endothelium-dependent mechanisms. Update on humoral regulation of vascular tone. Recent studies suggest that humoral and endothelium-dependent mechanisms may play an important role in the cerebral circulation. Angiotensin may acutely and chronically increase resistance of large cerebral arteries and reduce cerebral microvascular pressure without changing cerebral blood flow. We hypothesize that the brain may sense reductions in microvascular pressure and initiate compensatory neurohumoral responses to raise arterial pressure. Vasopressin appears to play an important role in regulation of production of cerebrospinal fluid and brain fluid volume. Vasopressin also may be protective when intracranial pressure is elevated. Endothelium-dependent mechanisms also may have important influences on tone of cerebral vessels. Synthesis of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide, or a nitric oxide-containing compound, appears to influence both basal tone and responses of large cerebral arteries to acetylcholine in vivo. Large cerebral arteries dilate in response to increased blood flow in vivo, and this response may be mediated in part by release of a humoral factor by endothelium. Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles to receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated agonists are impaired during chronic hypertension. The mechanism of impairment of endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles appears to involve production of an endothelium-derived contracting factor. 
Treatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea with a dental orthosis. A dental orthosis, designed to increase the size of the upper airway by advancing the mandible, was used in 68 patients to treat snoring and varying degrees of obstructive sleep apnea. The orthosis increased the posterior airway space, as assessed by lateral cephalograms. Seven months (range 2 to 25) after beginning use, 75 percent of patients were using the orthosis regularly. Snoring, by report, was improved in all patients but one (p less than 0.001) and was eliminated in 42 percent (95 percent confidence interval 30 to 55 percent). Sleep quality and sleepiness were also reported improved. Apneas and hypopneas, measured before and after use in 20 patients with obstructive sleep apnea, were reduced from an average of 47 to 20 events per hour (p less than 0.001). Oxygenation and sleep disturbance were also improved. Apnea-hypopnea frequency was reduced with treatment to less than 20/h in 13 patients. Residual frequencies greater than 20/h were associated with higher initial frequencies of apneas and hypopneas. Side effects of orthosis use were minor, and no serious complications were observed. The dental orthosis is an effective treatment for the symptom of snoring and can also effectively treat obstructive sleep apnea of moderate severity. 
Decreased Gs alpha mRNA levels accompany the fall in Gs and adenylyl cyclase activities in compensated left ventricular hypertrophy. In heart failure, only the impairment in adenylyl cyclase activation progresses. We have previously reported that there is a global reduction in adenylyl cyclase associated with a decrement in Gs functional activity in cardiac sarcolemma from animals with pressure overload-induced hypertrophy and heart failure. This study was performed to determine whether hypertrophy alone in the absence of heart failure is sufficient to promote these changes and whether the superimposition of heart failure intensified these changes. Basal and stimulated adenylyl cyclase and Gs activity, as determined in the S49 cyc- reconstitution assay, were measured in sarcolemma from normal (NL), left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and heart failure (HF) animals. Simultaneously, we measured the mRNA level encoding for the Gs alpha subunit. These studies indicate that Gs activity and Gs alpha mRNA are decreased by approximately 30% both in the failing heart and even in the heart with compensated hypertrophy before heart failure develops (Gs activity, pmol cyclic AMP/10 min per microgram, NL 4.2 +/- 0.4, LVH 3.0 +/- 0.2, HF 3.2 +/- 0.3; Gs alpha mRNA, pg/10 micrograms RNA, NL 131 +/- 9.0, LVH 104 +/- 7.4, HF 97.4 +/- 9.1; P less than 0.05 as compared with NL for LVH and HF). Accompanying this decrement in Gs activity is a fall in adenylyl cyclase, both basal and stimulated. However, we also identified a further decrease in adenylyl cyclase without any additional change in Gs or in its alpha subunit mRNA level. This is seen only in the sarcolemma from animals with heart failure as compared with those with compensated LV hypertrophy (e.g., NaF-stimulated activity, pmol cyclic AMP/min per mg, NL 420.2 +/- 17.5, LVH 347.1 +/- 29.6, HF 244.2 +/- 27.3; P less than 0.05 compared with NL for LVH and HF, P less than 0.05 compared with LVH for HF). In summary, these studies indicate that both Gs and adenylyl cyclase activities fall in parallel with the development of LV hypertrophy followed by a further decrement in adenylyl cyclase, independent of Gs, in the setting of heart failure. 
A controlled study of low and high volume anesthetic jelly as a lubricant and pain reliever during cystoscopy. To evaluate the influence of the volume of 2% lidocaine jelly as an anesthetic during cystoscopy 241 men and women received either 11 or 20 ml. jelly intraurethrally in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Pain was recorded on a visual analogue scale by the patient and on a 3-level scale by the physician. The pain scores according to the visual analogue scale were significantly higher in the patients given 11 ml. jelly than in those given 20 ml. when all patients in the study were analyzed. There was no significant difference in the visual analogue scale between the 2 treatments in women but a significant difference was noted in men, although in men older than 55 years the difference was not statistically significant. There was general agreement between the visual analogue scale results and the physician scores but the visual analogue scale procedure was more sensitive in detecting differences between treatments. It is suggested that approximately 11 ml. 2% lidocaine jelly is the appropriate volume for women and 20 ml. is the appropriate volume for men during cystoscopy but that the lower volume of jelly may be sufficient in older men. 
Localized vs generalized pyogenic granuloma. A clinicopathologic study. We herein report the unusual case of a previously healthy young man who had spontaneous development of multiple lobular capillary hemangiomata disseminated over the integument. Based on the observation that the single lesions exhibited (immuno)pathologic and ultrastructural features similar, if not identical, to those of late-stage pyogenic granulomas, we propose to nosologically include our patient's eruption within the disease spectrum of pyogenic granuloma. As opposed to the occurrence of localized forms of pyogenic granuloma, the disseminated eruption seen in our patient and in other patients whose cases are reported in the literature cannot be ascribed to physical trauma. As some of these latter patients suffered from an underlying malignant neoplasm, it is tempting to speculate that both exogenous (eg, trauma) and endogenous (eg, tumor cells) factors can lead to the release of mediators promoting the development of these vascular neoplasms. 
Current surgical technique to repair Fallot's tetralogy with absent pulmonary valve syndrome. The experience with surgical repair of Fallot's tetralogy and absent pulmonary valve syndrome is reviewed. Twenty-two patients aged 1 day to 8 years were treated between 1982 and 1989 using one surgical technique. This consisted of resection of the main pulmonary artery and large parts of the anterior wall of the right and left pulmonary artery. The ventricular septal defect was closed with a patch, and an aortic or pulmonary homograft (size, 8 to 24 mm) was interposed between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Two of the 8 infants operated on died; there was one late death. All 14 older children survived the operation. All survivors are well up to 7 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 3.6 years). We recommend early treatment of infants; older children can be treated electively. The technique used in our series gives excellent results. 
Preoperative diagnosis by enteroclysis of unsuspected closed loop obstruction in medically managed patients. Initial observation and evaluation of patient progress have reduced the number of operative interventions in the management of small intestinal obstruction. The differentiation of simple mechanical from strangulating obstructions has remained difficult. Strangulation is not an invariable component of a closed loop obstruction. We report 27 patients with small bowel obstruction initially managed nonsurgically, in whom enteroclysis 2-8 days after admission demonstrated unsuspected closed loop obstruction. In 25 of the 27 patients, subsequent surgery confirmed the radiologic diagnosis: all the obstructed loops were viable and there was no operative mortality. Our experience suggests that the early performance of enteroclysis should be considered in patients with small bowel obstruction undergoing a trial of nonoperative management. 
The effects of low doses of n-3 fatty acid supplementation on blood pressure in hypertensive subjects. A randomized controlled trial. The potential antihypertensive effects after prolonged use of small doses of fish oils remain undefined. Therefore, we conducted a randomized, double-blind, controlled crossover study comparing low doses of n-3 fatty acid supplementation with n-6 fatty acids on blood pressure in 33 subjects with mild hypertension. After a 6-week stabilization period, subjects ingested either 2.04 g/d of n-3 fatty acids or safflower oil (4.8 g/d of linoleic acid) for 12 weeks, then crossed over to the alternative encapsulated oil for another 12 weeks, after a 4-week washout period. All antihypertensive drug therapy had been discontinued. For the combined data, there were significant reductions from pretreatment values for supine diastolic (-2.4 mm Hg) and sitting systolic (-4.1 mm Hg) blood pressure after fish oil; no significant changes occurred after safflower oil control. Compared with safflower oil, fish oil supplementation was associated with a statistically significant reduction in mean supine diastolic blood pressure of 3.7 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -7.3 and 0.1). Sitting diastolic and mean arterial pressures showed a sequence effect; therefore, only the initial period was used in an analysis of their responses. There were significant decreases from pretreatment values for sitting diastolic (-4.4 mm Hg), mean arterial (-5.1 mm Hg), and systolic (-6.5 mm Hg) blood pressure after fish oil. The differences between groups after the 12-week period remained statistically significant for sitting diastolic and sitting mean arterial blood pressures. No adverse changes were noted in plasma levels of lipid-related measures. 
Helium-oxygen and conventional mechanical ventilation in the treatment of large airway obstruction and respiratory failure in an infant. The application of 70% helium-30% oxygen mixtures by tight-fitting face mask in the emergency management of large airway obstruction is well known. We present the case of an infant with severe large airway obstruction and respiratory failure that was unresponsive to the more traditional approaches of airway management, including the delivery of He-O2 by face mask, endotracheal intubation, and conventional mechanical ventilation with oxygen alone. This case was successfully managed with He-O2, when concentrations of O2 were lower than those previously reported in association with conventional mechanical ventilation, until the obstruction could be surgically corrected. We suggest using a new combination of the low-density helium-oxygen gas mixtures and conventional mechanical ventilation, both of which are readily available in most intensive care units. 
Acetaminophen induced pancreatitis. This is the fourth reported case of acute pancreatitis associated with acetaminophen overdose. The patient had ingested the smallest amount of acetaminophen (9.75-13 g) that has been reported to produce acute pancreatitis. This patient also suffered liver and renal impairment and developed an ileus and ascites. Despite late therapy and laboratory tests that indicated a poor prognosis the patient made a complete recovery without sequelae. 
Role of balloon angioplasty in the treatment of aortic coarctation. Since the initial report of coarctation balloon angioplasty in 1982, several groups have used this technique for native coarctations in neonates, infants, and children and for postoperative recoarctations. However, recommendations for use of balloon angioplasty as a treatment procedure of choice are clouded by reports of aneurysm development at the site of coarctation. Here we review our experience as well as that published in the literature, including Valvuloplasty and Angioplasty of Congenital Anomalies Registry data, and present evidence in support of balloon angioplasty as a therapeutic procedure of choice for treating native and recurrent postoperative aortic coarctations. Balloon angioplasty of native aortic coarctations in 20 neonates and infants 1 year old or less reduced peak systolic pressure gradient across the coarctation from 40 +/- 12 mm Hg (mean +/- standard deviation) to 11 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001); no patient required immediate surgical intervention. The residual gradient at follow-up (mean follow-up, 12 months) in 16 infants was 18 +/- 16 mm Hg, a significant improvement (p less than 0.01) compared with preangioplasty values. In none of the patients did an aneurysm develop. Recoarctation developed in 5 (31%) of the 16 infants and was successfully treated either by surgical resection (in 2) or by repeat balloon angioplasty (in 3). A comparison of mortality and recurrence rates between the balloon angioplasty and surgical groups was made with the help of data pooled from the literature published since 1980. The initial (7% versus 23%) and late (2% versus 25%) mortality and recoarctation (11% versus 18%) rates were higher (p less than 0.025) after surgical intervention than after balloon therapy. When only reports in which patients were operated on after 1979 were included in this type of analysis, the initial and late mortality rates remained higher (p less than 0.01) after operation than after angioplasty, and the recoarctation rates became similar (p greater than 0.1). Thirty-two children (greater than 1 year old) underwent balloon angioplasty of native coarctation with a resultant reduction in peak systolic pressure gradient from 48 +/- 19 mm Hg to 10 +/- 9 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), which continued to remain low (14 +/- 11 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) at follow-up catheterization in 24 children 13 months (mean) later. There were no immediate or late deaths. A small aneurysm developed in 1 patient (4%) but did not require intervention. Recoarctation developed in 2 patients (8%), and in both, repeat balloon angioplasty was performed with good results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Adjusting the dose to the individual response of the patient during the induction of ovulation with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone. To identify the effective dose of intravenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone necessary to induce ovulation in patients with chronic anovulation of diverse etiology, 40 women were subdivided into four groups: idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH), functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, normoandrogenic oligomenorrhea, and polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). During 90 treatment cycles, the dose was the only parameter that was progressively adjusted. The overall ovulation rate per cycle was 100% in IHH, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, and normoandrogenic oligomenorrhea, using only 5 micrograms/90 minutes in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and normoandrogenic oligomenorrhea and up to 7.5 micrograms/90 minutes in IHH. In PCOS, the ovulation rate was 67.6%, using up to 20 micrograms/90 minutes. The lesser degree of effectiveness observed in PCOS can probably be explained by the different basal endocrine profile presented by these subjects. 
Hemorrhage following mandibular osteotomies: a report of 21 cases. Hemorrhage associated with mandibular osteotomies, especially to the extent that it becomes life threatening, is a rare occurrence and its risk is less than that following maxillary orthognathic surgery. Twenty-one cases of significant bleeding following mandibular sagittal split ramus osteotomies, vertical and oblique ramus osteotomies, and genioplasties are presented. Life-threatening hemorrhage associated with mandibular osteotomies is primarily an intraoperative problem and the incidence of major postoperative and recurrent hemorrhage is not as great as following maxillary osteotomies. Suggestions for the avoidance and treatment of these bleeding complications are discussed. 
Effects of lidocaine on reperfusion arrhythmias and electrophysiological properties in an isolated ventricular muscle model of ischemia and reperfusion. Transmembrane electrical activity was recorded from endo- and epicardium of isolated segments of guinea pig right ventricles with standard microelectrode techniques. An ECG was also recorded by two electrodes placed at opposite ends of the tissue bath. Regular stimulation was delivered to the endocardium. Tissues were exposed to simulated ischemia for 15 min and then were reperfused with "normal" Tyrode's solution. Rapid sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy or trigeminy with characteristics of transmural reentry occurred in early reperfusion in 14 of 20 hearts (70%). Arrhythmias were accompanied by prolongation of transmural conduction time and abbreviation of endocardial effective refractory period. With lidocaine, at 1, 5, 10 and 50 microM, reperfusion arrhythmias occurred in 53.3, 22.2, 20.8 and 14.3% of hearts, respectively. The decreased incidence of arrhythmias was statistically significant for 5 to 50 microM lidocaine (P less than .01). The antiarrhythmic effect did not correlate with changes in transmural conduction time, endocardial effective refractory period, or endocardial excitability. However, antiarrhythmic concentrations of lidocaine selectively depressed epicardial excitability and significantly increased endo- to epicardial conduction block during late ischemic and early reperfusion periods. Epicardial inexcitability extended to late diastole and conduction block was not restricted to premature beats. Thus, in transmural reentry in which the epicardium is an essential component of the circuit, lidocaine may interrupt the circuit by selectively rendering this component inexcitable. 
Changes of zero-stress state of rat pulmonary arteries in hypoxic hypertension. Zero-stress state of the main pulmonary arteries, from the main trunk to a vessel with a lumen diameter approximately 60 microns, was determined in 25 normal control and 38 hypoxic pulmonary hypertensive rats. Pulmonary hypertension was induced by placing the rats in a hypoxic chamber with 10% O2-90% N2 at atmospheric pressure. The zero-stress state of each vessel was obtained by first cutting the vessel transversely into a series of rings and then cutting each ring radially, whereupon the ring opened into a sector, which is characterized by an opening angle defined as the angle subtended between two lines originating from the midpoint of the inner wall (endothelium) to the tips of the inner wall. Whereas the pulmonary blood pressure increased monotonically during the development of pulmonary hypertension, the opening angle followed a different course; e.g., the values (means +/- SD) of the opening angle at the pulmonary trunk at times 0 (control) and 2, 12, 28, 96, 144, 240, 480, and 720 h after exposure to hypoxia are, respectively, 294 +/- 30 degrees, 378 +/- 24 degrees, 385 +/- 12 degrees, 374 +/- 11 degrees, 246 +/- 63 degrees, 267 +/- 49 degrees, 193 +/- 19 degrees, 195 +/- 83 degrees, and 239 +/- 38 degrees. Trends at other places on the artery are similar, but the magnitudes differ. In this period of time, intimal edema and thickening were found. The intima media thickened rapidly from 48 to 240 h and then more slowly from 240 to 720 h. Adventitia thickened later; its thickness exceeded that of the intima media at approximately 96 h. Thus the changes of zero-stress state of the pulmonary arteries are seen to be related to the nonuniform remodeling of the vessel wall as revealed by the edema, blebs, and thickening of different layers. 
Long-term results of choledochoduodenostomy in the treatment of choledocholithiasis: assessment of 225 cases. During a 10-year period 2610 patients were operated on for biliary lithiasis; in 225 (8.6 per cent) cases the operation concluded with a choledochoduodenostomy. The commonest preoperative diagnosis (62.2 per cent) in these 225 patients was choledocholithiasis; 30 patients had previously had a cholecystectomy. After choledochoduodenostomy, 4.0 per cent of patients had an intra-abdominal complication; six patients developed an intra-abdominal abscess and three developed an external biliary fistula. Four patients (1.8 per cent) died, three from pulmonary complications and one from a biliary fistula. After a mean follow-up period of 4.6 years, 71.5 per cent of patients were asymptomatic. The remainder suffered from dyspepsia (15.1 per cent), colicky pain (8.7 per cent) or episodes of cholangitis (4.7 per cent). Endoscopy in the symptomatic patients allowed the following conclusions: (a) no patient with dyspepsia had a problem at the anastomosis; (b) 27 per cent of those with colic had anastomotic stenosis or the sump syndrome; and (c) all patients with cholangitis had anastomotic stenosis and residual calculi. 
Dual effects of N-ethylmaleimide on ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats. The effects of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a sulfhydryl (SH) blocker, on ethanol-induced gastric lesions were investigated in rats by varying the route of administration. Oral administration of acidified ethanol (60% ethanol in 150 mM HCl, 1 ml) produced hemorrhagic bandlike lesions in the gastric mucosa. Pretreatment of the animals with orally administered NEM (0.1-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited these lesions (the inhibition was over 80% at 1 mg/kg or greater), and the effects were partially reversed by indomethacin (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous). However, when NEM (10 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously, this agent significantly worsened the lesions. Intragastrically applied NEM produced a dose-dependent reduction of the transmucosal potential difference (PD) and the mucosal nonprotein SH levels, an increase of the volume of gastric contents, and an inhibition of gastric motility, while these parameters remained unaltered after subcutaneous administration of the agent. The microvascular permeability in the mucosa was significantly increased by both oral and subcutaneous administration of NEM (10 mg/kg) but remained unchanged in response to lower doses of orally administered (less than 3 mg/kg). These results suggest that NEM given orally is cytoprotective to the stomach against ethanol, probably by acting as a mild irritant and due to dilution of an irritant and inhibition of gastric motility (muscle relaxation), but when given subcutaneously it aggravates the lesions by unknown mechanisms. 
Bladder and sphincter behavior in patients with spinal cord lesions. To ascertain the relationship between the clinical neurological level, and bladder and sphincter behavior, the video-urodynamic studies of 489 patients with spinal cord lesions due to a variety of causes were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were classified based on the clinical neurological level, etiology of the lesion and presence or absence of signs of sacral cord involvement. Urodynamic findings were classified as either detrusor hyperreflexia, detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia, detrusor areflexia or normal. The results indicate that although there was a general correlation between the neurological level of injury and the expected vesicourethral function, it was neither absolute nor specific. For example, 20 of 117 cervical cord lesions had detrusor areflexia, 42 of 156 lumbar cord lesions had detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia and 26 of 84 sacral cord had either detrusor hyperreflexia or detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. However, if one considers the presence of neurological abnormalities, 84% of the suprasacral cord lesions with detrusor areflexia have sacral cord signs. In contrast, all suprasacral cord lesions with no evidence of sacral cord involvement have either detrusor hyperreflexia or detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia. The positive predictive value for positive sacral cord signs and detrusor areflexia was 87%. The positive predictive value for negative sacral cord signs and detrusor hyperreflexia/detrusor-external sphincter dyssynergia was 81%. These data suggest that the clinical neurological examination alone is not an adequate barometer to predict neurourological dysfunction and that video-urodynamic evaluation provides a more precise diagnosis for each patient. 
Phase I trial of H65-RTA immunoconjugate in patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. H65-RTA is an immunoconjugate that consists of the A chain of ricin (RTA), a ribosomal-inhibiting protein, coupled to a murine monoclonal antibody (H65) directed against the pan-T-cell antigen CD5. The CD5 antigen is heterogeneously expressed on cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tumor cells, but is not expressed on normal cells except lymphocytes. A phase I trial was therefore conducted in which 14 patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma progressive on other therapies were treated with up to three cycles of H65-RTA. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of H65-RTA was 0.33 mg/kg/d administered intravenously for 10 days as defined by dyspnea at rest at higher doses. Other reversible side effects included myalgia, mild hypoalbuminemia with weight gain, pedal edema, fatigue, fevers, and chills. Six patients received more than one cycle of H65-RTA without increased side effects compared with the first cycle. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that peak serum drug levels were dose-dependent, and ranged from 1.13 to 5.56 micrograms/mL, with a terminal half-life ranging from 1.0 to 2.9 hours. The development of antibodies against the immunoconjugate was associated with a lower peak drug level, but not with enhanced side effects. Partial responses lasting from 3 to 8 months were documented in four patients. Three of the responding patients received more than one cycle of H65-RTA in the presence of anti-immunoconjugate antibodies. The results from this phase I trial suggest that H65-RTA is an active drug in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The immunoconjugate may be safely administered repeatedly, even in the presence of anti-immunoconjugate antibodies, with responses noted. Additional studies at the MTD are needed to define the response rate in this disease. 
Cerebellorubral degeneration after resection of cerebellar dentate nucleus neoplasms: evaluation with MR imaging. The authors describe the magnetic resonance (MR) findings in seven patients who developed severe cerebellar symptoms and atrophy of the contralateral red nucleus following removal of unilateral neoplasms in the deep nuclei of the cerebellum. For most patients, pre- and postoperative spin-echo MR images were obtained with long repetition times (TRs) at 1.5 T. The long TR images obtained before surgery demonstrated unilateral masses involving the dentate nucleus. Long TR images obtained after surgical resection of the dentate nucleus showed increased signal intensity in all of seven contralateral red nuclei, three of seven ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncles, and two of seven contralateral inferior olivary nuclei. Three other patients who underwent surgery for cerebellar neoplasms without resection of the dentate nuclei showed no postoperative brain stem changes on MR images. The authors speculate that the changes in the contralateral red nuclei are due to cerebellorubral degeneration (since well-described neural tracts interconnect the dentate nucleus and the contralateral red nucleus). Injury of the dentate nucleus may result in degeneration of distant neural connections. 
Improved treatment results in boys with overt testicular relapse during or shortly after initial therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A Pediatric Oncology group study. Boys with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who have overt testicular relapse (OTR) during initial continuation chemotherapy or within 6 months thereafter have poor outcomes, with long-term survival similar to patients with marrow relapse during treatment. In April 1983, the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) adopted for these patients an intensive treatment protocol (POG 8303) consisting of a four-drug systemic reinduction (prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, and asparaginase), a brief intensive consolidation phase with teniposide and cytarabine, and a 2-year program of continuation chemotherapy with weekly rotating drug pairs (vincristine/cyclophosphamide and teniposide/cytarabine) with or without (by randomization) four-drug reinforcement pulses every 16 weeks. Bilateral testicular radiation (2600 cGy) was administered during reinduction, and intrathecal chemoprophylaxis was given every 4 to 6 weeks. Among 38 eligible study patients with OTR, 5 had prior or concominant extramedullary relapse in other sites. The median duration of complete remission before OTR was 27 months (range, 10 to 42 months). All 38 patients achieved clinical remission after reinduction. Three patients withdrew while in remission, 22 had another relapse (12 marrow, 5 central nervous system (CNS), 2 testicular, 1 retroperitoneal, 1 prostate, and 1 eye), and 13 (34%) remain in complete remission from 32+ to 74+ months after OTR (median, 53+ months). Eighteen patients had their therapy electively discontinued, and five relapses occurred thereafter. These results are superior to those observed in patients with first marrow relapse treated with the same protocol. Approximately one third of patients with OTR treated with POG protocol 8303 exhibit prolonged second remissions with the potential for cure. 
Human papillomavirus DNA types in squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. Previous studies have found variable evidence suggestive of a role for human papillomavirus (HPV) in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. In this study 49 cases of primary verrucous or squamous cell carcinoma from patients referred to a regional medical center were examined initially by Southern blot hybridization to detect HPV types 2, 6, 11, 13, 16, 18, and 32. Approximately 60% of carcinomas from certain head and neck sites, particularly the floor of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, piriform sinus, and larynx, were positive for episomal viral DNA of HPV-6, -11, -16, or -18. HPV DNA was found in some multiple tumors from separate sites of the same patient. Integration of viral DNA into the host cell chromosome was likely in a minority of the positive carcinomas, and no novel HPV DNA types were indicated by the hybridization analyses. Subsequently, DNA remaining from 30 of the carcinomas was examined by a more sensitive polymerase chain reaction amplification assay for DNA of HPV-6, -11, -16, and -18. Twenty-seven of the samples were positive for one or more HPV DNA types, with all positive carcinoma samples containing oncogenic HPV-16 or -18 DNAs. Almost all the patients examined were of the middle to older age group with a history of tobacco use. Although HPV infection of oral mucosa may be a frequent occurrence, a possible role for HPVs in the multifactorial etiology of head and neck carcinogenesis merits further epidemiologic investigation. 
Bilateral optic disc neovascularization in association with retinitis pigmentosa. Bilateral neovascularization of the optic disc developed in a 16-year-old Hispanic girl with retinitis pigmentosa. The neovascularization regressed in both eyes over 1 year without treatment. Ocular and systemic evaluation failed to reveal a recognized cause for the neovascularization. To our knowledge this is only the third case reported of this unusual association. 
Thymic carcinoid. Carcinoid of the thymus is a rare neoplasm. Differentiation from thymoma is important because they have entirely different prognosis. A patient in whom a 19 x 18 x 12 cm carcinoid tumor of the thymus was surgically removed is presented. The tumor metastasized to peritracheal and internal mammary nodes, and invaded the SVC, pleura, lung, and pericardium. This is apparently the largest reported tumor of its kind. Prior to induction of anesthesia cardiopulmonary bypass and rigid bronchoscopy were readily available. Awake intubation was utilized. Even though long-term prognosis is poor, an aggressive surgical approach and adjuvant radiotherapy may achieve extended survival with excellent quality of life. Central aspects of the disease as well as pivotal therapeutic points are discussed. 
Epidural fentanyl does not influence intravenous PCA requirements in the post-caesarean patient. Forty ASA physical status I or II patients scheduled for elective Caesarean delivery were studied to determine the effect of epidural fentanyl on post-Caesarean delivery analgesic requirements as administered by intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Following delivery of the infant, under epidural anaesthesia with lidocaine 2% with 1/200,000 epinephrine, patients were randomly assigned to receive either 10 ml of preservative-free normal saline via the epidural catheter or 100 micrograms of fentanyl with 8 ml preservative-free normal saline in a double-blinded fashion. On arrival in the post-anesthesia recovery room (PAR), patients were provided with intravenous PCA meperidine 12.5 mg every eight minutes as needed. Patients were visited at intervals over the next 24 hr to determine if any differences in narcotic requirements, demands for narcotics, or severity of pain were noted. No differences were observed in any values between the groups. It is concluded that a single bolus of epidural fentanyl does not provide an advantage for postoperative pain relief in this patient population. 
Inhibitor of the thrombin time in systemic amyloidosis: a common coagulation abnormality. Patients with primary systemic amyloidosis (AL) often experience bleeding, and we report a newly recognized coagulation abnormality in AL. Of 103 patients with primary systemic AL studied over 2 years, 41 had prolongation of the thrombin time (range, 25 to 46 seconds; normal, less than 22 seconds) and reptilase time (range, 17 to 39 seconds; normal, 14 to 16 seconds). The fibrinogen from the plasma of 36 patients was precipitated by beta-alanine and diluted to a concentration of approximately 200 mg/dL. The thrombin times of the precipitated fibrinogens were normal in 34 patients, implying that an inhibitor was responsible for the abnormal tests. The addition of patient fibrinogen-free plasma to normal plasma prolonged the thrombin times, and this result confirmed the presence of an inhibitor. The inhibitor is more likely to be present in patients with nephrotic syndrome (20 of our patients) and congestive heart failure (six). A circulating monoclonal protein (24 patients), the presence of amyloid liver involvement (eight), and the presence of amyloid neuropathy (nine) were not predisposing factors. Only one patient had deficiency of factor X. We conclude that inhibition of fibrinogen conversion to a fibrin clot rather than dysfibrinogenemia is the cause of the prolonged thrombin time in primary systemic AL. 
Serum cholesterol concentration and coronary heart disease in population with low cholesterol concentrations. OBJECTIVE--To examine the relation between serum cholesterol concentration and mortality (from coronary heart disease and from other causes) below the range of cholesterol values generally seen in Western populations. DESIGN--Prospective observational study based on 8-13 years of follow up of subjects in a population with low cholesterol concentrations. SETTING--Urban Shanghai, China. SUBJECTS--9021 Chinese men and women aged 35-64 at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Death from coronary heart disease and other causes. RESULTS--The average serum cholesterol concentration was 4.2 mmol/l at baseline examination, and only 43 (7%) of the deaths that occurred during 8-13 years of follow up were attributed to coronary heart disease. There was a strongly positive, and apparently independent, relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from coronary heart disease (z = 3.47, p less than 0.001), and within the range of usual serum cholesterol concentration studied (3.8-4.7 mmol/l) there was no evidence of any threshold. After appropriate adjustment for the regression dilution bias, a 4 (SD 1)% difference in usual cholesterol concentration was associated with a 21 (SD 6)% (95% confidence interval 9% to 35%) difference in mortality from coronary heart disease. There was no significant relation between serum cholesterol concentration and death from stroke or all types of cancer. The 79 deaths due to liver cancer or other chronic liver disease were inversely related to cholesterol concentration at baseline. CONCLUSION--Blood cholesterol concentration was directly related to mortality from coronary heart disease even in those with what was, by Western standards, a "low" cholesterol concentration. There was no good evidence of an adverse effect of cholesterol on other causes of death. 
Comparative morphologic and immunohistochemical studies of estrogen plus alpha-naphthoflavone-induced liver tumors in Syrian hamsters and rats. Syrian hamsters were treated with ethinylestradiol and maintained on a diet containing alpha-naphthoflavone (alpha NF), a regimen that produces a high incidence of liver tumors. Morphologic analyses (light microscopy, immunoperoxidase studies, and electron microscopy) were performed on livers of these animals. After 4 months of hormone plus alpha NF treatment, marked hepatocyte cell changes were already present, as demonstrated by loss of eosinophilic staining of hepatocyte cytoplasm. Large multinucleated hepatocytes exhibiting frequent mitoses were observed around central veins. After 5 months of treatment, there was proliferation of bile ducts, and small cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm resembling hepatocytes appeared surrounding these bile ducts. At 7 to 8 months, the first tumor nodules (foci) were seen. Tumor foci in the portal area consisted of small clusters of large cells resembling hepatocytes with irregular nuclei. At the same time, dysplastic glands were identified among proliferating bile ducts. By 8 to 10 months, large tumors were present. These were trabecular hepatocellular carcinomas with widely varying individual cell morphology. Compared with adjacent liver, dysplastic glands in the portal areas, microcarcinomas, and large tumors all showed intense immunostaining for cytokeratin. Rats treated with the same regimen also developed hepatic tumors, but the light and electron microscopy results and immunohistochemical profiles were very different. Altered hepatic foci composed of small hepatocytes were typically prominent; however, malignant tumors did not arise from the portal area. Neither altered foci nor tumors stained significantly for cytokeratin. These data suggest that the biochemical events giving rise to these liver tumors differ between the species studied, despite the animals being exposed to the same treatment regimens. 
Cocaine and chest pain: clinical features and outcome of patients hospitalized to rule out myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features, electrocardiographic findings, and hospital course in patients admitted with acute chest pain temporally related to cocaine use. DESIGN: Retrospective data analysis. SETTING: A 485-bed county hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred and one consecutive patients with cocaine-related chest pain admitted to the hospital to rule out myocardial infarction. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The quality of the chest pain frequently suggested myocardial ischemia. Dyspnea was common (56%). The onset of chest pain occurred during cocaine use in 21% of patients, within 1 hour of use in 37%, and after 1 hour of use in 42%. Admission electrocardiographic findings were interpreted as normal in 32% of patients; as acute myocardial injury in 8%; as early repolarization variant in 32%; as left ventricular hypertrophy in 16%; and as "other" in 12%. Forty-three percent of patients had ST-segment elevation meeting the electrocardiographic criteria for use of thrombolytic therapy, but such elevation was usually due to the early repolarization variant. The initial total creatine kinase was elevated more than 3.3 mu kat/L (200 U/L) in 43% of patients, and an elevated total creatine kinase was recorded at some time during the hospital course in 47% of patients. The creatine kinase MB fraction was less than 0.02 in all patients. Myocardial infarction was ruled out in all patients. No patient experienced in-hospital cardiovascular complications. CONCLUSION: The quality of acute chest pain related to cocaine use is indistinguishable from that experienced in acute myocardial ischemia. Abnormal or normal variant electrocardiographic findings are common in patients with chest pain related to cocaine use, but nevertheless the incidence of acute myocardial infarction is low. The ST-segment and T-wave changes can mimic acute myocardial injury and are most likely normal findings in young black men that can be readily recognized in the emergency department. Most of these patients do not require admission to an intensive care unit. 
Smell and taste disorders, a study of 750 patients from the University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center. Smell and taste disorders are common in the general population, yet little is known about their nature or cause. This article describes a study of 750 patients with complaints of abnormal smell or taste perception from the University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center, Philadelphia. Major findings suggest that: chemosensory dysfunction influences quality of life; complaints of taste loss usually reflect loss of smell function; upper respiratory infection, head trauma, and chronic nasal and paranasal sinus disease are the most common causes of the diminution of the sense of smell, with head trauma having the greatest loss; depression frequently accompanies chemosensory distortion; low body weight accompanies burning mouth syndrome; estrogens protect against loss of the sense of smell in postmenopausal women; zinc therapy may provide no benefit to patients with chemosensory dysfunction; and thyroid hormone function is associated with oral sensory distortion. The findings are discussed in relation to management of patients with chemosensory disturbances. 
Transmural distribution of myocardial tissue growth induced by volume-overload hypertrophy in the dog. BACKGROUND. Although chronic volume overload is thought to induce uniform cardiac enlargement, the stimulus for tissue growth has not been defined. Changes in diastolic and systolic stress or strain have been proposed as mechanical factors that may stimulate hypertrophy. Since there are thought to be transmural variations in these stresses and strains, three-dimensional patterns of myocardial tissue growth may provide insight into the role of these factors. METHODS AND RESULTS. To assess the transmural variation in tissue growth after volume overload, the configurations of three columns of four to six gold beads (1-mm diameter) implanted in the left ventricular anterior free wall were recorded in five dogs before and after cardiac enlargement induced by creating a systemic arteriovenous fistula. Data were obtained with end-diastolic pressures adjusted to the same level in the control and hypertrophic states. End-diastolic wall thickness remained constant, whereas left ventricular diameter increased. Small increases in transmural systolic strain were seen. The volumes defined by four beads (a tetrahedron) at end diastole showed increases in myocardial mass of 20-27% after 3.6 (mean) weeks of hypertrophy and were uniform across the wall of the left ventricle. The edges of single bilinear-quadratic finite elements were fitted to the three columns of the bead set at end diastole in control and at end diastole after hypertrophy at equal end-diastolic pressures. Thus, continuous transmural strain distribution were obtained at the hypertrophic state with respect to the control state. The transmural distributions of these end-diastolic growth strains were uniform and positive for both the circumferential and longitudinal components measured in a cardiac coordinate system, with small radial growth strain indicating that growth was predominantly parallel to the epicardial tangent plane. Moreover, when strains were transformed (rotated) to fiber coordinates, in-plane fiber and cross-fiber growth strains were both positive at all locations across the wall and approximately equal in magnitude, indicating considerable growth in the cross-fiber direction. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that the stimulus for volume-overload hypertrophy may be constant across the wall and that substantial cross-fiber growth occurs during volume-overload hypertrophy. 
Cell kinetics by bromodeoxyuridine labeling and deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy in prostatic carcinoma needle biopsies. We studied 63 prostate carcinomas in needle biopsies after labeling in vitro by incubating the entire biopsy specimen with tritiated thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine before fixation. Biopsies from 176 patients were labeled, of which 98 were benign and 78 were carcinomas (15 carcinomas were excluded because of scant tissue). The procedure did not interfere with histological diagnosis. Median labeling index was 0.87% (range 0.1 to 29.3%). A labeling index exceeding 3% was unusual but it may indicate the potential for rapid clinical progression. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) flow cytometry was performed on the last 44 carcinomas using cells shed by the prostatic needle biopsy tissue samples during transportation to the pathology laboratory. A sufficient number of cells were obtained for analysis in 37 cases, of which 6 were DNA aneuploid. Labeling index correlated with Gleason histological grade and score, and data from the 6 DNA aneuploid carcinomas suggest association between DNA aneuploidy and a high labeling index. Estimates of percentage of S-phase cells by flow cytometry did not correlate with variables other than DNA index, and appear to have been affected by a high noise-to-signal ratio (few proliferative cells relative to cellular debris) and inability to discriminate between benign and carcinomatous cells. 
Long-term ambulatory cassette EEG with sphenoidal recording in complex partial seizures. Long-term ambulatory cassette EEG with sphenoidal recording (A/EEG-SP) was performed in 51 patients. Group A comprised 31 patients with a clinical diagnosis of complex partial seizures (CPS), and group B comprised 20 patients suspected of having CPS. In group A, detection of temporal spikes was 27% by routine EEG (R/EEG), 72% by sphenoidal EEG (SP/EEG), 27% by A/EEG with temporal chain montage, and 91% by A/EEG-SP. The highest yield achieved by A/EEG-SP as compared with other EEG recordings was documentation of spontaneous seizures of temporal lobe origin. The detection rate of spontaneous seizures by A/EEG-SP was approximately 30%, and the focal or regional onset of seizures could be determined in 60% of patients. In group B, detection of temporal spikes was 11% by R/EEG, 18% by SP/EEG, and 30% by A/EEG-SP. Spontaneous seizures were recorded by A/EEG-SP in two patients (10%). Thus, A/EEG-SP was more effective than A/EEG in detecting interictal and ictal temporal discharges, and A/EEG-SP was superior to SP/EEG in documenting spontaneous seizures of temporal lobe origin. 
Gastroesophageal reflux and upper airway diseases. GER can have important impacts on the upper airway passages, and in turn, upper airway obstruction can certainly aggravate reflux. This relationship should be considered in the newborn or young infant, faced with a sudden life-threatening event, and in the older child or adult presenting with chronic head and neck complaints, either unexplained or unresponsive to adequate medical therapy. A causal relationship may be difficult to establish, based first on clinical expertise as a guideline, on laboratory tests, among which pharyngeal pH monitoring could be promising, and on response to medical antireflux therapy. A better understanding of the significance of high levels of reflux and defective acid clearance, as well as a more precise knowledge of the maturation and functioning of upper airway protective mechanisms, would open the way to more accurate diagnostic procedures, to a more reliable definition of the abnormal, and to greater efficiency in the management of these patients. 
Pentavalent technetium-99m-DMSA uptake in a patient having multiple myeloma without amyloidosis. A pentavalent 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was performed on a patient with multiple myeloma without amyloidosis. A high accumulation of the tracer was found in numerous tumors. We believe that the accumulation of DMSA is unrelated to amyloidosis and that the DMSA scan may have potential for the staging of tumors in patients presenting with multiple myeloma. 
The influence of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy on atopic dermatitis. The prevalence of a premenstrual deterioration in the symptoms of atopic dermatitis, as determined by a postal questionnaire completed by 150 women, was 33%. There was a significant association between a premenstrual worsening of atopic dermatitis and the presence of the symptoms of the premenstrual syndrome (P less than 0.002). Pregnancy had an adverse effect on atopic dermatitis in the majority of cases (52%), usually starting in the first 20 weeks of gestation, although an appreciable proportion of women (24%) had improved during their pregnancy. 
Comparison of cellular protooncogene activation and transformation-related activity of human melanocytes and metastatic melanoma. Two cell lines (NH and HM1), established from patients with metastatic melanomas, were evaluated for the presence of activated cellular protooncogenes. Northern blot analysis demonstrated increased expression of the c-myc gene (from 9 to 14 times) in NH and HM1 cell lines by densitometric comparison with human melanocyte cell lines. Analysis of the expression of 13 additional cellular protooncogenes revealed either no detectable levels (c-fms, c-abl, v-src, c-erb A1, c-erb B, v-mos, TGF beta, and c-myb) or unaltered expression levels (cH-ras, N-ras, c-fos, and c-sis) in normal human melanocytes and metastatic melanomas. Elevated expression of the c-myc gene was also detected in two long-term cultured melanoma cell lines (RPMI 7951 and SKMEL-30). Analysis of c-myc expression by in situ hybridization in HM1 cells showed that expression was not localized to a sub-population of cycling cells and all cells were overexpressing c-myc mRNA. Differences in relative abundance of c-myc transcripts suggests a relationship with the ability of DNA from these cell lines to efficiently transform NIH 3T3 cells and form colonies on soft agar. 
Sulfasalazine treatment in juvenile chronic arthritis: an open study. In an open study, the effect of sulfasalazine was evaluated in the treatment of juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA). Forty-one patients, i.e., 27 boys and 14 girls with JCA under 16 years of age, were included in the study. In all of them, treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) had been unable to control the disease. The patients were divided in 4 subgroups depending on the mode of onset and evolution (Type I = systemic onset, Type II = polyarticular form. Type IIIa and Type IIIb = pauciarticular form). Remission was achieved in 21 patients, significant improvement in 12. Status was unchanged in 4 patients and worsened in 3. In 5 patients side effects were observed, which forced interruption of treatment in 4. Sulfasalazine was stopped in 7 patients: for toxicity in 4 and for inefficacy in 3. In 7 other patients the treatment was terminated after a prolonged remission. These promising results must be confirmed in a double blind versus placebo study, preferably restricted to type III JCA. 
In vitro fragmentation of gallstones: comparison of electrohydraulic, electromagnetic and piezoelectric shockwave lithotripters. To compare the fragmentation efficiency of three different shockwave systems, 63 human gallstone triplets were disintegrated in vitro using an electrohydraulic (MPL 9000, Dornier), an electromagnetic (Lithostar Plus, Siemens) and a piezoelectric (Piezolith 2300, R. Wolf) lithotripter. Since each stone triplet was obtained from the same gallbladder, the concrements of one such set were identical in physicochemical parameters. According to the maximal diameter, the calculi were divided into group A (6 to 15 mm) and group B (16 to 30 mm). Shockwave application was terminated when residual fragments measured 4 mm or less. Forty-five triplets were fragmented at energy settings mainly used in clinical treatment of patients with gallbladder stones (MPL 9000: 20 kV; Lithostar Plus: setting 9 (maximal); Piezolith 2300: setting 3). The fragmentation endpoint was achieved in group A (n = 3 x 36) with the Piezolith 2300 after median 150 (range = 50 to 500) pulses and with the Lithostar Plus after 150 (50 to 750) pulses compared with 500 (50 to 1,500) pulses using the MPL 9000 (p less than 0.01). In group B (n = 3 x 9) the Lithostar Plus (median = 750, range = 250 to 1,250 pluses) required fewer discharges than the Piezolith 2300 (1,250, 250 to 2,500 pulses; p less than 0.05) and the MPL (1,500, 500 to 1,600 [upper limit] pulses; p less than 0.01). 
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgery, and postoperative radiation therapy for invasive thymoma. Between January 1988 and June 1990, seven previously untreated patients with histologically confirmed and clinically staged IIIa invasive thymoma (IT) were enrolled in a prospective, single treatment arm study of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) followed by surgery and postoperative radiation therapy (4600 to 6000 cGy). The NC included three cycles of cisplatin (75 mg/m2 on day 1), epirubicin (100 mg/m2 on day 1), and etoposide (120 mg/m2 on days 1, 3, and 5), every 3 weeks. All patients showed a partial response (greater than 50%) and underwent complete (n = 4) or incomplete (gross [n = 1] or microscopic [n = 2] residual tumor) surgical resection. Histologic examination was negative for two completely resected patients. Projected 2-year survival was 80%; all patients but one currently are alive and disease-free. This approach appeared to be feasible and may be a new therapeutic choice in the management of IT, but its use on a regular basis should be reserved until a larger number of patients and longer follow-up are available. 
Bezold-Jarisch reflex in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex is an inhibitory reflex that originates from the heart, is mediated by the vagus nerve, and is manifested by hypotension and bradycardia. We present 4 pediatric cardiac surgical patients, aged 1 day to 9 months, who exhibited cardiovascular collapse in their early postoperative course. In each patient, cardiovascular deterioration was marked by an insidious decrease in arterial blood pressure without an associated change in heart rate, central venous pressure, or airway pressure. Bradycardia followed the decrease in blood pressure. The Bezold-Jarisch reflex was suspected and atropine was administered, first as a bolus injection at 0.01 mg/kg, and later, as a continuous infusion at 0.01 mg.kg-1.h-1. Atropine prevented recurrent episodes of hypotension and bradycardia. We believe the Bezold-Jarisch reflex is more prevalent than previously suspected in postoperative pediatric cardiac surgical patients. 
Comparative effect of heparin treatment with and without strenuous exercise on treadmill capacity in patients with stable effort angina. It has recently been demonstrated that treadmill capacity and collateral circulation improve as a result of exercise with heparin pretreatment in patients with effort angina. In the present study, we assessed whether heparin alone is effective in increasing treadmill capacity in 14 patients with effort angina. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: (1) group A--20 treadmill exercise periods with standard Bruce protocol twice a day for 10 days with heparin (5000 IU intravenously) pretreatment (seven patients) or (2) group B--10 injections of heparin calcium (10,000 IU subcutaneously) once a day for 10 days (seven patients). In group A, total exercise time was increased from 6.9 +/- 1.2 (SD) to 9.9 +/- 1.9 minutes (p less than 0.0005), as was the maximal double product, from 21,700 +/- 3,500 to 27,000 +/- 4,800 mm Hg/min (p less than 0.05). The double product at the onset of angina was also increased by 34% (p less than 0.05), and the double product at which ST depression (0.1 mV) first appeared was 22% (p less than 0.05) greater after treatment. In contrast, in group B, all of the above-mentioned parameters of treadmill capacity remained unchanged. These data indicate that heparin does not serve as an angiogenic factor by itself, but that it potentiates the ischemia-derived angiogenic factor. 
Pregnancy-induced changes in drug metabolism in epileptic women. The pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs may be altered during pregnancy, resulting in decline of serum concentrations and subsequent suboptimal control of seizures. We investigated changes which may occur during pregnancy in hepatic drug handling by comparing metabolic ratios of 15 pregnant epileptic women to 15 nonpregnant epileptic women, as well as 10 pregnant nonepileptic and 10 nonpregnant nonepileptic controls. We used the caffeine test to describe several enzyme activities: P450 1A2, xanthine oxidase, n-acetyltransferase and hydroxylation. For this end, ratios were calculated among a number of metabolites of the main demethylation pathway of caffeine. In addition, we measured D-glucaric acid excretion for specific characterization of antiepileptic drug metabolism. Paired comparison of epileptic women in late pregnancy and six to eight weeks post partum revealed statistically significant decreases in P450 1A2, xanthine oxidase and n-acetyltransferase activities, and a significantly increased hydroxylation activity during pregnancy. Twenty-one of the 30 epileptic women (70%) were found to be fast acetylators, whereas the normal distribution in the nonepileptic control groups was 50%. Excretion of D-glucaric acid was significantly increased in all epileptic patient groups as compared to the matched nonepileptic control groups. Importantly, it was also significantly increased in the pregnant nonepileptic control group as compared to the nonpregnant nonepileptic women. Overall, our results suggest that enzymatic pathways involved in antiepileptic drug metabolism tend to be increased during pregnancy as a potential cause for observed lower serum concentrations of these drugs. 
Problems and coping strategies of individuals with traumatic brain injury and their spouses. A pilot investigation is reported on the problems and coping strategies of 20 married men and 11 married women with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their able-bodied spouses. All injured subjects experienced severe head injury at least one and a half years earlier. A structured, small-group discussion process was used to elicit a prioritized list of problems and a similar list of coping strategies. Individuals with TBI and their spouses identified problems in living as most important; loss of employment and restrictions on autonomy were reported as the most problematic. Men with TBI placed priority on controlling their anger, whereas, women with TBI were concerned with their mood disorders, particularly depression. Women with TBI and able-bodied wives of men with TBI placed high priority on the use of support groups as a coping strategy. Men placed higher priority on individualistic approaches to adjustment, such as suppression of feelings. A number of testable hypotheses resulted from the pilot study. 
Adult polycystic disease of the liver. Adult polycystic liver disease (APLD) is a rare disorder of liver parenchyma occasionally requiring surgical treatment. Its association with adult polycystic kidney disease has meant that as renal dialysis has become widely available there is an increased number of patients surviving with cystic liver changes. Although usually asymptomatic, patients with APLD may present with abdominal pain or swelling. Liver function is not usually compromised and computed tomography or abdominal ultrasonography are the most useful investigations. The complications of cyst rupture, infection, cholangiocarcinoma and compression of surrounding structures are discussed. Surgical treatment remains controversial, and the options of cyst puncture, fenestration with or without hepatic resection, and liver transplantation are reviewed. 
Image processing in swallowing and speech research. An image processing system for application to studies of the temporal and spatial parameters of movement during swallowing and speech is described. Image sequences from videotape are digitized for computerized manipulation and analysis in an attempt to improve on conventional visual inspection. The system is "interactive" or "event-driven": after executing a function, the computer waits for guidance from the user who controls the program through keyboard and mouse input, selecting options from menus and responding to prompts. The analyst alters image clarity by the application of filters and heightens contrast through video enhancement. A technique called "remapping" reduces head motion and provides uniform spatial scaling. Animated sequences of images are used, as opposed to frame-by-frame analysis, to preserve temporal context and increase efficiency of measurement. Low cost off-the-shelf personal computer hardware is used along with original software tailored to the application. 
Treatment of urticaria and angioedema: low-sedating H1-type antihistamines. H1-type antihistamines are considered the therapeutic agents of choice for treating urticaria and angioedema. The use of traditional H1 antihistamines is limited by their side effects. In recent years low-sedating H1 antihistamines with reduced sedative and anticholinergic side effects have become popular choices for the treatment of urticaria and angioedema. Terfenadine and astemizole are currently available in the United States, and cetirizine and loratadine, currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, are available in other countries. Terfenadine, cetirizine, and loratadine achieve rapid peak plasma concentrations in 1 to 2 hours, whereas astemizole has a slow onset of action. In double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of chronic idiopathic urticaria, low-sedating H1 antihistamines were more effective than placebo. The choice of a particular low-sedating H1 antihistamine depends on pharmacokinetic considerations and frequency of administration. 
Value and limitations of color Doppler echocardiography in the evaluation of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty for isolated mitral stenosis. The limitations of 2-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiography in patients undergoing mitral valvuloplasty are well known. This study was undertaken to assess the value of color Doppler flow imaging in 36 symptomatic mitral stenosis patients who subsequently underwent successful balloon mitral valvuloplasty by comparing the results to those obtained at cardiac catheterization. Color Doppler-guided conventional Doppler assessment agreed well with cardiac catheterization results in classifying mitral stenosis as mild, moderately severe and severe, both before and after valvuloplasty. Color Doppler was also useful in identifying patients who had moderate to severe mitral regurgitation before and after valvuloplasty. Color Doppler flow mapping was more sensitive than oximetry in the detection of iatrogenic atrial septal defects, which were noted in 25 patients. The defects of those patients with smaller defects by color Doppler (diameter less than 0.7 cm) or echocardiographic shunt volume less than 0.7 liters/min tended to close, usually within 6 months, as opposed to those with larger defects or higher shunt volumes, which tended to persist. Echocardiographic shunt volumes revealed a fair correlation with oximetric results. 
Sustained ventricular tachycardia associated with sarcoidosis: assessment of the underlying cardiac anatomy and the prospective utility of programmed ventricular stimulation, drug therapy and an implantable antitachycardia device. The presentation, cardiac anatomy and utility of programmed ventricular stimulation in seven patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia associated with sarcoidosis are described. The mean patient age was 38 +/- 8 years. Pulmonary involvement was apparent in three patients and no systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis were present in one patient. All patients had electrocardiographic abnormalities at rest and six had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%. All seven patients had left ventricular wall motion abnormalities and five had mitral valve dysfunction. Sustained ventricular tachycardia was easily induced in all patients. Spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia was not prevented with corticosteroid administration. Despite antiarrhythmic drug therapy, two patients had sudden cardiac death and an additional four had recurrence of ventricular tachycardia. Four patients had an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator implanted and received drug therapy; all four received appropriate shocks. This report represents the largest descriptive series of consecutive patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia associated with sarcoidosis. Antiarrhythmic drug therapy of ventricular tachycardia in patients with sarcoidosis, even when guided with programmed ventricular stimulation, is associated with a high rate of arrhythmia recurrence or sudden death, or both. Thus, implantation of an automatic antitachycardia device (cardioverter-defibrillator) should be considered as primary therapy in such patients. Furthermore, sarcoidosis should be excluded, with Kveim skin testing if necessary, in any patient with sustained ventricular tachycardia of unknown origin. 
Peroxisomes and the fatty liver of malnutrition: an hypothesis. Peroxisomes play a role in hepatic beta-oxidation of fat, a process that results in the production of hydrogen peroxide. The fatty infiltration of the liver that occurs in severely malnourished children remains unexplained. We observed an almost total absence of peroxisomes in the hepatocytes of these children. We suggest that lack of available peroxisomes could contribute to the development of fatty liver. 
Vasoconstriction of canine coronary collateral vessels with vasopressin limits blood flow to collateral-dependent myocardium during exercise. This study was performed to test the hypothesis that active constriction of coronary collateral vessels can worsen hypoperfusion of collateral-dependent myocardium during exercise. Studies were performed in seven adult mongrel dogs in which intermittent followed by permanent occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery produced an area of collateral-dependent myocardium without gross evidence of infarct. Myocardial blood flow was determined with microspheres while measurement of aortic and distal coronary pressures allowed calculation of collateral and small vessel resistance at rest and during treadmill exercise. The ability of collateral vessel constriction to limit blood flow was assessed by infusion of vasopressin during exercise. During control conditions, blood flow in the collateral zone underwent a subnormal increase during exercise in comparison with the normal zone (1.74 +/- 0.27 versus 2.50 +/- 0.40 ml/min/g, respectively, p less than 0.05). Infusion of vasopressin in a dose that caused no change in normal zone flow (0.01 microgram/kg/min i.v.) produced a 30 +/- 5% further decrease in flow to the collateral zone (p less than 0.01). This decrease in collateral zone flow resulted from a 48 +/- 14% increase in transcollateral resistance in response to vasopressin infusion (p less than 0.01), as well as a 40 +/- 9% increase in small vessel resistance in the collateral zone (p less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that active constriction of both collateral vessels and coronary resistance vessels can contribute to hypoperfusion of collateral-dependent myocardium during exercise. 
Myocardial revascularization for chronic stable angina. Analysis of the role of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty based on data available in 1989 No prospective, randomized clinical trial comparing coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and conservative therapy has been reported. To address when revascularization is indicated, we constructed a decision analytic model. Our model incorporates procedure-related mortality and morbidity, coronary artery disease-related mortality, and the benefit of revascularization. We determined the quality-adjusted life expectancy and expected costs for each strategy. Our model suggests that angioplasty is a reasonable alternative to bypass surgery in patients with favorable lesions if angioplasty would provide a comparable degree of revascularization. Our model predicts that patients treated with angioplasty will have more revascularization procedures than will patients treated with bypass surgery but predicts that both treatments will cost the same over the typical patient's lifetime. In many patients with severe angina or documented ischemia, angioplasty is indicated for stenosis of a single artery. In patients with two vessel disease that is amenable to angioplasty, angioplasty may be a reasonable alternative to bypass surgery. Even in patients whose three vessel disease can be completely revascularized by angioplasty, bypass surgery, although relatively expensive, is slightly better than angioplasty. In patients with three vessel disease and comorbidities that increase operative risk, angioplasty may be a reasonable alternative to either bypass surgery or medical therapy. 
Hepatitis B vaccination in children infected with Schistosoma mansoni: correlation with ultrasonographic data. Forty-one schoolchildren with positive stools for Schistosoma mansoni eggs and 39 age- and sex-matched children with negative stools were given 3 doses, 5 micrograms each, of a plasma derived hepatitis B vaccine. Their sera were examined 3 and 9 months after the third dose for hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs). At 9 months after vaccination, both the number of responders and the mean of antibody titers were significantly higher in the control group than in the group infected with S. mansoni (97% vs. 56% and 334.8 +/- 192.9 vs. 67.7 +/- 74.4 mIU/ml). There was a negative correlation between anti-HBs titers and the long diameter of the spleen as well as between the titers and the long diameter of the spleen and the liver span in the mid-clavicular line (right lobe) taken together. There was also a positive correlation between anti-HBs titers and the diameters of the portal vein. There was no correlation between anti-HBs titers and any of the following 3 parameters: liver span in the mid-clavicular line (right lobe) alone, liver span in the middle line (left lobe) alone, and the degree of thickness of the periportal fibrosis. There was also no correlation between anti-HBs titers and egg counts in the stools. An interpretation of these findings was made in the light of the role of phagocytic activity of the liver and spleen as well as of porta-caval shunts in the immune mechanism. 
Growth and histopathology of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma implanted intraorally in nude mice. A human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) from the floor of the mouth (FOM) was implanted by a needle aspiration technique in the FOM site of athymic nude mice. Mice were killed at 3-week intervals, and the oral cavity, mandible, and neck were sectioned and examined histologically. Tumor growth was observed in 65% of the animals, with histologic features consistent with the engrafted human invasive SCC. These features included invasion of connective tissue in 92%, invasion of muscle in 77%, invasion and destruction of bone in 54%, and vascular invasion in 15% of the mice. In contrast, FOM tumor implanted subcutaneously on back sites of nude mice was totally encapsulated by fibrous connective tissue with evidence of capsular invasion. SCC from other head and neck sites showed similar locally invasive growth after intraoral implantation in nude mice. The results demonstrate the invasive characteristics of human head and neck SCC grown in the homologous oral cavity site in nude mice and support the nude mouse as a biologically relevant in vivo model in the investigation of the biologic characteristics and therapy of head and neck carcinoma. 
Clinical and CT correlates in the diagnosis of intracranial tumours. The correlation between clinical and CT findings in cerebral tumours was prospectively studied in 1191 consecutive referrals for cerebral CT. CT revealed a mass lesion in 51 cases (4.3%): 32 neoplasms, five haematomas and one abscess. The diagnostic specificity of CT for neoplasmic tumours was 86% (32 of 37). The clinical suspicion of a cerebral neoplasm was correct in 25 cases (78%) and the clinical localisatory hypothesis was correct in 20 cases (63%) of the neoplasms. A cerebral tumour was found in 5% (11 out of 226) of patients investigated for their first seizure and in 1% (two of 207) investigated for headache without clinical signs. 
Blunted renal sodium excretion during acute saline loading in normotensive men with positive family histories of hypertension. The natriuretic and intra-arterial blood pressure response to an acute saline load (1000 mL 0.9% NaCl), was studied in normotensive young men with positive (n = 11) and negative (n = 21) family histories of hypertension. The age-matched (36 +/- 5 years) control group with negative family histories of hypertension was subdivided into two groups, one matched for body mass index (BMI) to the subjects with positive family histories of hypertension (n = 10), and another lean control group (n = 11). Baseline blood pressure was significantly higher in subjects with positive family histories of hypertension and in controls matched for BMI as compared with lean controls. Sodium excretion increased in all three groups during the saline infusion, while subjects with positive family histories of hypertension disclosed a diminished natriuretic response as compared with the two control groups. Systolic blood pressure increased significantly during the saline load in subjects with positive family histories of hypertension, while in subjects with negative family histories of hypertension, no significant change in blood pressure was observed. Plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, serum aldosterone, plasma noradrenaline, blood volume, and ouabain-sensitive erythrocyte sodium efflux rate constant did not differ between the three groups at baseline. A significant negative correlation was found between baseline sodium excretion and sodium efflux rate constant in subjects with positive family histories of hypertension. We conclude that the subjects with positive family histories of hypertension exhibit a blunted natriuretic and an exaggerated blood pressure response to an acute saline load as compared with the two control groups with negative family histories of hypertension. This could be of neuronal and/or hormonal origin. 
Left ventricular outflow obstruction resulting from insertion of mitral prostheses leaving the native leaflets intact: adverse clinical outcome in seven patients. Left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction may result from retaining the anterior mitral leaflet when a mitral prosthesis is inserted in the mitral anulus. We retrospectively reviewed the echocardiograms (two-dimensional Doppler and Doppler color flow imaging, or transesophageal with color flow imaging) obtained in seven patients with preoperative mitral regurgitation who had a prosthesis implanted with the native mitral leaflets left intact. Systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet, as seen in dynamic LV outflow tract obstruction, was observed in six of seven patients. LV fractional shortening preoperatively was less than or equal to 0.25 in all (mean 0.20 +/- 0.04) and did not significantly (p = ns) increase postoperatively (mean 0.27 +/- 0.12). Color flow imaging revealed disturbed systolic flow in the LV outflow tract in five patients, and all had systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet. Continuous wave Doppler detected significant systolic LV outflow tract jets in five patients averaging 4.1 +/- 0.9 m/sec. Mitral prosthetic function was normal (pressure half-time of 81 +/- 25 msec and mean gradient of 7 +/- 3 mm Hg +/- SD) in five patients. Clinical follow-up revealed that all had died, six of them within 2 months of their operation. Thus systolic anterior motion of the native anterior mitral leaflet occurs commonly after prosthetic mitral valve insertion with the native leaflets left intact. Continuous wave Doppler often demonstrates increased systolic LV outflow tract velocities consistent with dynamic LV outflow obstruction. 
Treatment of systemic vasculitis with pooled intravenous immunoglobulin. The therapeutic effect of a course of high-dose, pooled, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) on disease activity and circulating antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) was investigated in 7 patients with systemic vasculitis. 5 had active disease despite conventional immunosuppression, and 2 had not received any treatment. All 7 had clinical improvement, which was sustained in 6 and transient in 1. The fall in ANCA concentrations to a mean of 51% of the pre-treatment values was maintained during follow-up. C-reactive protein concentration also dropped considerably. IVIg seemed to confer a useful therapeutic effect without adverse reaction. 
Three different frameshift mutations of the tyrosinase gene in type IA oculocutaneous albinism. Mutations in the gene for the pigment-producing enzyme tyrosinase are responsible for type IA (tyrosinase-negative) oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). Most reported mutations have been single base substitutions. We now report three different frameshift mutations in three unrelated individuals with type IA OCA. The first individual has a single base deletion within a series of five guanidines, resulting in a premature stop codon in exon I on one allele and a missense mutation at codon 382 in exon III on the homologous allele. The second individual is a genetic compound of two separate frameshift mutations, including both the same exon I single base deletion found in the first individual and a deletion of a thymidine-guanidine pair, within the sequence GTGTG, forming a termination codon (TAG) in exon I on the homologous allele. The third individual has a single base insertion in exon I on one allele and a missense mutation at codon 373 in exon III on the homologous allele. The two missense mutations occur within the copper Bbinding region and may interfere with either copper binding to the enzyme or oxygen binding to the copper. These five different mutations disrupt tyrosinase function and are associated with a total lack of melanin biosynthesis. 
Selective microscopic examination of gallbladders, hernia sacs, and appendices. The usefulness of many "routine" medical procedures is being challenged in the health care atmosphere of today. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of routine microscopic pathologic examination of three frequently submitted surgical specimens. Pathology reports of 39,568 consecutive specimens, 17,105 appendices, 14,654 hernia sacs, and 7,809 gallbladders, submitted over a 49-year period, were reviewed. Microscopic examination of these tissues detected few unexpected findings. In those instances in which unexpected findings were discovered the primary surgery was curative or additional surgery would not have altered the prognosis. When careful, thorough gross examination by the surgeon and pathologist failed to disclose significant abnormalities or confirmed obvious disease such as inflammation, microscopic examination of these tissues might have been eliminated without a change in patient outcome. Although it could be argued that this microscopic pathologic correlation may be helpful for quality control and/or feedback of surgical decision making, the data indicate that gross examination alone may be sufficient in most cases, since unexpected microscopic findings are rare. The indications for microscopic examination of appendices, hernia sacs, and gallbladders are listed. Substantial savings of resources and time may be expected when selective microscopic examination is used. 
Older age and elevated blood pressure are risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage after thrombolysis. Intracerebral hemorrhage is an important concern after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, but risk factors are controversial. Accordingly, we assessed risk factors in 107 treated patients of whom 4 had intracerebral hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage occurred at a mean of 25 hours (range 3.5 to 48) after therapy and was fatal in 2 patients. Significant differences were found between patients with and without intracerebral hemorrhage for age (77 +/- 7 vs 62 +/- 11 years, p less than or equal to 0.01), and initial (161 +/- 23 vs 135 +/- 23 mm Hg, p less than or equal to 0.03) and maximal (171 +/- 30 vs 146 +/- 20, p less than or equal to 0.02) systolic blood pressures. Initial and maximal diastolic blood pressures also tended to be higher (101 +/- 25 vs 86 +/- 16, p less than or equal to 0.07; 104 +/- 24 vs 90 +/- 13, p less than or equal to 0.06). Differences did not achieve significance for comparisons of gender, height, weight, site of infarction, time to therapy, specific thrombolytic agent used, concomitant therapy, interventions and partial thromboplastin time. It is concluded that age (greater than or equal to 70 years) and elevated blood pressure (greater than or equal to 150/95 mm Hg) are important risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage. The overall balance of benefit and risk of thrombolysis should continue to be assessed by large mortality trials. 
Mortality in acute cerebral infarction in young adults--a ten-year experience. We reviewed the one-month mortality among 213 patients aged fifteen to forty-five years (mean thirty-five) with acute cerebral infarction (CI) evaluated during the period July 1, 1977, to February 1, 1988. Atherosclerotic cerebral infarction (ACI) was diagnosed in 59 (27.7%) patients, 53 (24.9%) had non-atherosclerotic vasculopathies (NAV); 46 (21.6%) had cardioembolic infarcts (CEI). Hematologically related disorders were diagnosed in 30 (14.1%) patients; the cause of CI could not be established in 25 (11.7%) patients. Fourteen patients (9 men, 5 women, mean age 34.8 years), (6.6%) died within thirty days of their CI: 7 had CEI (7/46,15.2%); 4 had ACI (4/59, 6.7%); and 3 had NAV (3/53, 5.6%). Our data suggest that young patients with acute CI have a thirty-day mortality rate lower than older patients. Deaths were most common in patients with CEI. Brain edema and herniation accounted for 6 (43%) of the deaths. 
Body fat, coronary heart disease, and stroke in Japanese men. The Honolulu Heart Program (HHP) is a prospective study of heart disease and stroke in Japanese-American men in Hawaii. Body weight, height, and subscapular and triceps skinfold thicknesses were measured by using standard methods at the baseline exam held in 1965-1968. The relationship of measures of body fatness to the 20-y follow-up for coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke of these men was explored. Body mass index (BMI), subscapular skinfold thicknesses, and centrality index (subscapular skinfold thickness/triceps skinfold thickness) were predictors of CHD in this population, even after other risk factors were added to a multivariate model, indicating an independent contribution of body fat to CHD risk. Neither BMI nor centrality index was related to stroke. However, subscapular skinfold thickness was an independent predictor of stroke. The implications of these findings are that lifestyle changes that lead to an increase in obesity of Japanese men in Hawaii may increase risk for cardiovascular disease. 
IIB osteosarcoma. Current management, local control, and survival statistics--The Netherlands. Guarded optimism is justified in light of the results of treatment of IIB osteosarcoma in the Netherlands. This is due to improvements in diagnostic imaging techniques, staging, adjuvant chemotherapy, and surgical treatment. Five-year survival rates have increased from 25% to 80%. En bloc resection is currently possible. This makes reconstructive procedure justified, both from an oncologic and orthopedic view. Many questions are still unanswered, concerning evaluation of tumor necrosis because of chemotherapy, optimal adjuvant therapy, functional evaluation of different types of reconstruction, and psychological development of the patient. An international gathering of data on the overall treatment of IIB osteosarcoma is advocated to find answers on the above-mentioned questions. A noninvasive adjustable-lengthening prosthesis is mentioned as a Dutch solution to leg-length discrepancy. This prosthesis can be used after limb-saving surgery in young children. 
Minimal change nephrotic syndrome in adults: response to corticosteroid therapy and frequency of relapse. Rate of response to a corticosteroid and frequency of relapse were studied in 33 patients with adult-onset minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). Of these, 28 patients were treated with oral prednisolone (PSL) at 1 mg/kg/d for from 4 to 8 weeks depending on their response, followed by PSL, at gradually tapering doses for 1 year. Five severely nephrotic patients received 1 g of methylprednisolone intravenously (IV) for 3 days, followed by 40 mg/d oral PSL for 4 to 8 weeks and finally PSL in gradually reduced doses. Sixteen patients (48%) were free of proteinuria within 4 weeks, and 25 (76%) within 8 weeks. Two patients required cyclophosphamide for induction of remission. Age at presentation was not significantly correlated with response time to corticosteroid therapy. Thirty-two (97%) went into remission, and relapse occurred in 11 (34%) of these. As assessed by the life-table method, 84% of patients were still in remission at 6 months after induction of remission, 75% after 1 year, and 63% during the follow-up period (mean, 47.1 +/- 29.1 months; range, 6 to 123 months). Incidence of relapse was not correlated with remission induction time, ie, earlier (less than or equal to 4 weeks) or later (greater than 4 weeks), but was greater in younger (less than 30 years of age) patients than older (greater than or equal to 30 years) patients (P less than 0.03). At the last follow-up, 31 patients (94%) were in complete remission and had normal renal function. 
Applying psychometric criteria to functional assessment in medical rehabilitation: I. Exploring unidimensionality. While rehabilitation providers are facing increasing pressure to document treatment outcomes, critics have warned against the inappropriate use of ordinal functional assessment data in arithmetic operations. Two salient criticisms concern the combination of items representing multidimensional abilities into a single total score, and the indeterminate distances between hierarchical functional assessment scale categories. In this initial study, the factor structure of the Patient Evaluation and Conference System (PECS) was studied to assess the potential for unidimensional measurement. Factor analysis of a multidiagnostic dataset (n = 3,564) yielded eight factors accounting for 60% of the variance among 68 PECS items. The factors indicate that several unidimensional measures may underlie the PECS. These factors are delineated, and further studies of unidimensionality and additivity are recommended. 
Ganglioside GM3:GD3 ratio as an index for the management of melanoma. This report evaluates the relevance of the ratio of the melanoma-associated ganglioside, GD3, and its precursor, GM3, to prognosis and management of Stage II disease. Tumor biopsy specimens from 42 melanoma patients were examined for the ratio and found that GD3 and GM3 constitute 80% of the total lipid bound sialic acids (LBSA) of melanoma. Although the ratio of GM3:GD3 in melanocytes, the progenitors of melanoma, is 19:1 (based on %LBSA), it ranged from 15:1 to 1:5 in tumor biopsy specimens. Patients are categorized into three groups based on their GM3:GD3 ratio (%LBSA) of tumor tissues as Group I (ratio ranged from 15:1 to 1.5:1) (10 of 42), Group II (1.4:1 to 1:1.4) (13 of 42), and Group III (1:1.5 to 1:5) (19 of 42). When the overall survival of patients from the onset of Stage II disease was evaluated among different groups, patients belonging to Group I survived significantly longer than patients of Group II (P = 0.02) and Group III (P = 0.01). Interestingly, Group III expressed immunogenic gangliosides (GD2, GM2, and O-AcGD3) better than the other groups and may benefit more from therapies targeted against these gangliosides antigens. The results of this study indicate that GM3:GD3 ratio is an unusual but well-defined biochemical criteria that may be useful for prognosis and therapeutic management of the disease. Therefore, we propose a routine analysis of the GM3:GD3 ratio of tumors excised after surgery. Screening the ratio is feasible since melanoma expresses a simple profile of gangliosides unlike other forms of cancer. 
Hemodynamic effects and tolerability of intravenous amiodarone in patients with impaired left ventricular function. Acute hemodynamic effects and tolerability of intravenous amiodarone, 5 mg/kg administered over 5 minutes, were compared in patients with coronary artery disease and either a normal (left ventricular [LV] ejection fraction greater than or equal to 45%, n = 10, group N) or impaired LV function (ejection fraction less than 45%, n = 9, group L). Amiodarone reduced systemic vascular resistence and LV and aortic pressures in both groups (13%, 18%, and 13%, respectively [group N], and 15%, 17%, and 15%, respectively [group L]) over the short term. Heart rate initially increased (18%, group L, and 10% group N), but was followed by a late 6% decrease in group N only, and by a progressive reduction in contractility (Vmax), together with a rise in LV end-diastolic pressure (19% and 38%, respectively [group N] and 17% and 58%, respectively [group L]; all values p less than 0.05 versus control). Coronary flow increased significantly by 20% (group N) and 31% (group L), but only during amiodarone administration, accompanied by a 26% and 25% reduction in myocardial oxygen extraction in groups N and L, respectively. Stroke work decreased in both groups (20% [group N] and 19% [group L], p less than 0.05 versus control). In contrast, cardiac output only improved (10%) in patients with impaired ventricular function. Significant side effects did not occur. Thus relatively high dosages of intravenous amiodarone are well tolerated and improve cardiac pump function in patients with an impaired, but not with a normal cardiac function. However, the tendency to increase LV end-diastolic pressures necessitates careful monitoring in patients in whom preexisting LV filling pressure may be elevated. 
Bronchial carcinoid tumors: assessment with CT of location and intratumoral calcification in 31 patients. Bronchial carcinoid tumors (BCT) have long been regarded as predominantly central and rarely calcified. The authors retrospectively reviewed computed tomographic (CT) findings in 31 patients (thin-section CT studies in 18) who were seen at their institution with the histopathologic diagnosis of BCT (27 typical, four atypical) during the years 1978-1989. Eighteen BCT (58%) were central and 13 (42%) peripheral, with peripheral defined as located more than 2 cm distal to the origin of the appropriate segmental bronchus. CT scans revealed varied patterns of calcification in seven (39%) of the 18 central BCT and in one (8%) of the 13 peripheral BCT (P less than .1); overall, CT scans revealed calcification in eight (26%) of the BCT. The eight calcified tumors were each of the typical histopathologic type. Peripheral BCT (42%) were nearly as common as central BCT (58%), and CT detection of calcification in BCT was not uncommon (39% of central lesions; 26%, overall). 
Rickettsial infection of the central nervous system: the role of prompt antimicrobial therapy. Rickettsial diseases of man, which are prevalent in all the continents (except Antartica) continue to be a major health problem in tropical and temperate parts of the world. Rickettsioses must be considered in every traveller seeking medical attention soon after returning from endemic areas, since the disease can be associated with significant morbidity. When a definite diagnosis has been made by specific serological tests, prompt antimicrobial therapy is indicated. A tetracycline should be regarded as the drug of choice due to its high efficacy, low toxicity, superior in vitro activity and the possibility of relapse which can follow chloramphenicol therapy. 
Changes in splenic microcirculatory pathways in chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The spleen plays a central role in the pathogenesis of chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP); it produces massive quantities of antiplatelet antibodies, leading to accelerated phagocytosis of platelets. Lymphoid hyperplasia typically occurs in the spleen, characterized by large numbers of lymphatic nodules with active germinal centers. Whether changes in splenic microcirculatory pathways also occur is not known. We have studied this question by scanning electron microscopy of corrosion casts, comparing spleens removed from patients with ITP with normal spleens obtained from organ transplant donors. The casts demonstrate two major changes in microcirculatory pathways in ITP. Firstly, a striking proliferation of arterioles and capillaries is found in the white pulp and marginal zone (MZ), seen as extensive vascularization in 92.3% of lymphatic nodules (n = 191) versus 0.6% (n = 224) in normal spleens. Secondly, the marginal sinus, a series of flattened, anastomosing vascular spaces between the white pulp and MZ, is absent in 89.4% of lymphatic nodules versus 4.9% in normal spleens. The cause of these microcirculatory changes, which may not be exclusive to ITP, is presently unknown. Absence of the marginal sinus may affect distribution of blood flow through the MZ such that platelets spend increased amounts of time in the proximity of macrophages. In the presence of antiplatelet antibodies found in ITP spleens, this delayed transit would lead to greatly increased platelet destruction. 
Thin-layer chromatography to monitor cholesterol gallstone dissolution by methyl tert-butyl ether. We describe a simple and inexpensive method of monitoring methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) dissolution of cholesterol gallstones with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in 10 patients. TLC is a routine semiquantitative laboratory method that can be used to measure the cholesterol concentration present in the MTBE and bile mixture aspirated through the cholecystostomy catheter during gallstone dissolution. TLC is practical in the clinical setting because it can be used to determine if gallstone dissolution is occurring and when MTBE lavage is no longer effective. TLC is performed in the laboratory with routine material and is completed in 15 min. Each TLC measurement costs about $1. The procedure provides objective and specific chemical information on effectiveness and progression of gallstone dissolution, apart from the radiologic and sonographic studies. In our study, TLC signaled effective dissolution in the initial phase of gallstone dissolution by detecting large amounts of cholesterol in the MTBE and bile mixture even before a visible change in size or shape of the stone became apparent by transcatheter cholecystography or by sonography (six of 10 patients). Conversely, lack of cholesterol on TLC after 1 hr or more of MTBE infusion indicates that the stones are pigmented or contain substantial calcium. This means that dissolution with MTBE will be ineffective and that solvent infusion should be terminated. In those cases in which dissolution is progressing well, when TLC shows decreasing amounts of cholesterol in the effluent, only residual fragments insoluble to MTBE remain or the stone is sequestered from MTBE; at this point, solvent infusion should be discontinued or the catheter must be repositioned. Monitoring the rate of cholesterol dissolution by TLC provides important complementary information to cholecystography and sonography during gallstone treatment with MTBE. 
A comparison of two-point discrimination threshold of tactual, non-painful stimuli between chronic low back pain patients and controls. Differences in pain sensitivity between chronic pain patients and healthy controls have been reported. Seltzer and Seltzer extended this line of research in studying the sensitivity to non-painful stimuli. They reported that the 2-point discrimination threshold of chronic pain patients was higher than that of control subjects. However, the study of Seltzer and Seltzer suffered from several methodological shortcomings. Therefore, in the present study we tried to replicate the findings in a group of chronic low back pain patients using a design that was believed to be methodologically stronger. Replication failed: no evidence was found for the hypothesis that chronic pain patients are less sensitive to non-painful stimuli. Further studies on various defined types of acute and chronic pain patients are required. 
Hypertension in women: what is really known? The Women's Caucus, Working Group on Women's Health of the Society of General Internal Medicine. PURPOSE: To determine whether there is sufficient information in the medical literature to guide appropriate treatment of hypertensive women. DATA IDENTIFICATION: Epidemiologic surveys of hypertension, clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy, and studies of selected adverse effects of antihypertensive agents were identified through a computerized search using MEDLINE and by identifying all studies cited in current medical textbooks as supporting evidence for the guidelines for the treatment of hypertensive individuals. All epidemiologic studies selected were cross-sectional or longitudinal, multicenter, population-based surveys. All clinical trials were large, randomized studies comparing one or more antihypertensive agents with a placebo or nonplacebo control group. Epidemiologic studies and clinical trials were reviewed to assess the quantity and quality of information available regarding important aspects of hypertension in women. Data pertaining to epidemiology, natural history, results of treatment, and two significant side effects of antihypertensive treatment were examined. RESULTS OF DATA ANALYSIS: The prevalence of hypertension is greater in black women than in black men and is about equal in white women and men. Because women outnumber men in the population, there are more hypertensive women than men. The attributable risk percent (the proportion of end points that could be eliminated by removing hypertension) for cardiovascular complications of hypertension is higher for women than men. Clinical trials show clear benefit of therapy for black women but no clear benefit for white women; some studies suggest that treatment of white women is harmful. Lipid profiles and their relation to ischemic heart disease differ for women and men; there is currently no information on the effects of antihypertensive agents on serum lipids in women. Few data have been published on the frequency of sexual dysfunction in treated hypertensive women. CONCLUSIONS: Hypertension in women and its related cardiovascular outcomes are a major public health problem. Clinical trials of antihypertensive therapy do not fully support current guidelines for the treatment of hypertensive women. Research concerning adverse effects of antihypertensive agents has largely excluded women from consideration; further studies are required to guide appropriate treatment. 
The role of endogenous gonadotropin release in the etiology of ovarian enlargement during purified urinary follicle-stimulating hormone therapy. Patients with polycystic ovarian disease were grouped into three groups according to their maximum ovarian diameter (maxD) after ovulation induction by purified urinary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Serum luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH were measured daily by radioimmunoassay and size and number of follicles were assessed by ultrasonography. Follicle-stimulating hormone in group A (80 mm less than or equal to maxD) was significantly higher than those of group B (60 mm less than or equal to maxD less than 80 mm) and C (maxD less than 60 mm) for the last 4 days of the treatment. This FSH rise in group A was not accounted for by FSH accumulation by the study of pharmacodynamics, and so was thought to be of endogenous origin. Luteinizing hormone was also elevated 3 days before the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in both groups A and B. The number of follicles in group A at hCG administration was significantly greater than that of group C. Any significant differences were not found in either total amount of purified urinary FSH or in the basal FSH and the LH levels before treatment of the three groups. These results suggest that excessive ovarian enlargement during gonadotropin therapy is caused by multiple follicular development primarily stimulated by endogenous FSH. Endogenous LH release further enhances ovarian enlargement. 
Vascularized omentum graft for the reconstruction of the skull base after removal of a nasoethmoidal tumor with intracranial extension: case report. A 16-year-old boy with rhabdomyosarcoma occupying the nasal cavities and the ethmoid sinus with intracranial extension underwent transcranial surgery. The intradural tumor was resected first with the affected dura of the anterior skull base, and the dural defect was repaired with fascia harvested from the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle. The remaining tumor contiguous to the nasal cavities was completely extirpated. The cranial cavity was then exposed to the opened nasal cavities, where a revascularized omental graft was used to separate these compartments. Lyophilized dura was placed beforehand beneath the omental graft, as a roof to the nasal cavity, and was removed 3 weeks later through the nostril. A bony skull base repair was performed over the omentum using the inner table of the bone flap. Subcutaneous fat from the abdomen was placed on the bone graft for fixation and as an additional seal for the dural defect. Reconstruction of the anterior skull base with a vascularized omental transfer provides an efficient barrier to the nasal cavity. It also serves as an excellent supporting structure for regeneration of the mucosal epithelium of the nasal cavities. 
Acute colorectal ischaemia after anaphylactoid shock. A 29 year old woman is reported with bloody diarrhoea three hours after developing anaphylactoid shock. Sigmoidoscopy, barium enema, and histology showed rectal and colonic ischaemia to the splenic flexure. Recovery was complete. There was no history of vascular disease but the patient was taking an oral contraceptive. Thirty one other cases of spontaneous ischaemic proctitis are reviewed. 
Beta-blocker treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. Beneficial effect of carteolol in mice. BACKGROUND. The effects of carteolol, a nonselective beta-adrenergic receptor blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, were compared with those of metoprolol in a murine model of viral myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy caused by encephalomyocarditis virus. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the acute experiment, BALB/c and DBA/2 mice were inoculated with encephalomyocarditis virus. BALB/c mice were then given carteolol at 1 (n = 10), 10 (n = 10), 30 (n = 11), or 100 mg/kg (n = 9) daily, and DBA/2 mice were given carteolol at 1 (n = 9) or 10 mg/kg (n = 9) daily starting the day of inoculation. Controls were given distilled water (n = 23 for BALB/c mice and n = 8 for DBA/2 mice). BALB/c mice were killed on day 7, and DBA/2 mice were killed on day 14. In the subacute experiment, DBA/2 mice were inoculated with the virus and then given carteolol at 1 (n = 12) or 10 mg/kg (n = 16), or distilled water (n = 27) daily, starting on day 14. Mice were killed on day 28. Virus replication, murine survival, heart weight to body weight ratio, and histopathological findings were similar in each group in the acute and subacute experiments. In the chronic experiment, DBA/2 mice were inoculated with the virus and were then given carteolol at 1 (n = 13) or 10 mg/kg (n = 9), metoprolol at 30 mg/kg (n = 9), or distilled water (n = 31) daily, starting on day 14. Mice were killed on day 104. Heart weight to body weight ratio and histopathological scores were significantly lower in mice given carteolol than in the infected control group. Furthermore, left ventricular cavity dimension, left ventricular wall thickness, and myocardial fiber diameter of the left ventricle were significantly reduced in mice given carteolol compared with the control group. Metoprolol did not cause any significant changes compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that carteolol prevents the development of myocardial lesions similar to those in dilated cardiomyopathy after myocarditis in the chronic stage. 
Lack of correlation between histologic findings and response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer. A retrospective analysis was undertaken to assess the prognostic role of histologic findings in response to chemotherapy and survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Histologic material was available for 395 of 1587 patients treated for metastatic breast cancer at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center between 1973 and 1984. Chemotherapy consisted of 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide or similar drugs, with or without tamoxifen. Maintenance cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil was continued for 2 years after a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 450 mg/m2 was administered. The histologic distribution was as follows: infiltrating ductal carcinoma, 353; invasive lobular, 14; mixed histology, ten; mucinous, seven; signet ring, four; tubular, three; papillary, two; sarcomatoid, one; and apocrine, one. Because individual histologic types occurred infrequently, the patients were divided into infiltrating ductal and nonductal groups. Baseline patient characteristics included age, performance status, estrogen-receptor status, prior hormone response, disease extent, and levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and lactate dehydrogenase. These were similar in the two groups. Significantly more patients with nonductal histology had greater than three metastatic sites. There were also more patients with hemoglobin less than 10 mg/dl and albumin less than 3.5 mg/dl in the nonductal group of patients. However, statistically these factors did not have an impact on the results. There was a 63% response rate (17% complete and 46% partial) for the ductal group and a 60% response rate (12% complete and 48% partial) for the nonductal group. The time from initiation of chemotherapy to disease progression was identical (12 months) for the two groups. Survival from initiation of chemotherapy was not significantly different (22 months for ductal and 27 months for nonductal). Based on this study, the authors conclude that histologic findings have no bearing on patient response to chemotherapy or survival in metastatic breast cancer. 
Long-term results of simple and radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma. From 1974 to 1983, simple and radical nephrectomies were performed at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel Hashomer, Israel) for renal cell carcinoma. The authors reviewed 109 cases that were followed for a period ranging from 5 to 14 years. Simple nephrectomy was performed in 55 patients, and 54 patients underwent radical nephrectomy. The selection of the surgical procedure was based on the surgeon's preference and not on the basis of clinical stage, age, or sex. The surgical results and survival rates were assessed according to the pathologic stage of the tumors. Among patients with Stage I tumor, radical nephrectomy produced better survival rates at 5 and 10 years (P = 0.03); however, when the non-cancer deaths were excluded, the difference in survival was not statistically significant. For Stage I tumors the survival free of disease at 5 years was better for the radical nephrectomy group, but this difference was not statistically significant. No difference was noticed in the local recurrence rate between the two groups. Nephrectomy in patients with Stage IV disease did not alter survival regardless of the type of operation. 
Urinary tract malformations in identical twins. We describe 3 sets of twins with discordance for urological malformations. Zygosity was documented by HLA and blood group typing. It is suggested that evaluation of the identical twin of an affected patient should include the entire urinary tract because of the potential for different lesions. 
Piezoelectric lithotripsy for gallstones: analysis of results in patients with extended selection. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is successful in fragmenting gallstones, but less than 28 per cent of patients with gallstone disease fulfil the conventional criteria for treatment. However, no data exist to substantiate these selection criteria. In this study, the selection criteria were broadened to include patients with radiolucent stones of any size and number, and radio-opaque stones less than 3 cm in diameter. To date; 108 symptomatic patients with gallstones have received treatment. All patients received up to six outpatient sessions of ESWL (6000 shock waves per session) without sedation or analgesia. The dissolution therapy consisted of combined bile salt and terpene administration. The clearance rates were 9 per cent within 2 months, 21 per cent at 2-4 months, 38 per cent at 4-8 months, 60 per cent at 8-12 months, and 78 per cent at 12-18 months. Of patients with a successful outcome only 19 (18 per cent) would have satisfied traditional selection criteria. There have been no significant complications except in one patient who developed mild acute pancreatitis, which settled on conservative treatment, and two patients who developed acute cholecystitis. This study would suggest that the previously accepted selection criteria underestimate the number of patients suitable for gallstone ESWL and dissolution therapy. 
Late onset endophthalmitis associated with intraocular lens: a case of molecularly proved S. epidermidis aetiology. A case of severe endophthalmitis after cataract extraction followed by posterior chamber lens implantation is reported. Microbiological cultures from a tap of the patient's aqueous humour prior to lens explantation as well as from the explanted lens and aqueous and vitreous humour during operation yielded Staphylococcus epidermidis sensu stricto. Scanning electron microscopy showed massive colonisation of the lens loop by staphylococci. Clonal identity of all isolates was demonstrated by plasmid DNA analysis and sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of extra-cellular products. This is strongly suggestive of the aetiological role of S. epidermidis in this case of late onset endophthalmitis. 
Fatigue fracture of the ulna occurring in pitchers of fast-pitch softball. We have reported three cases of fatigue fracture of the ulna in male pitchers of fast-pitch softball. To elucidate the etiology of injury, we first selected three healthy male and three healthy female pitchers from a well-trained college team and analyzed their forearm movement by high-speed cinematography. This showed slight flexion of the elbow joints during wind-up motion, dorsal flexion of the hand joints upon releasing the ball, and extreme pronation of the forearms during the follow-through. We then took 8 mm CT scanning sections of the forearms. Using these images, we investigated shapes and areas of cross-sections of the ulna and its cortical and cancellous bones from the elbow to the hand joints. Our results reveal that the shapes of the sections are significantly different from circles at around the center of the ulna, and the cross-sectional areas are smaller in the middle one-third of the ulna than in other parts. These observations imply that fatigue fractures of the ulna in pitchers of fast-pitch softball must be torsionally induced, tending to occur at the middle one-third of the bone. 
Hepatic interferon-alpha gene transcripts and products in liver specimens from acute and chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In this study we have examined the localization of interferon-alpha in liver tissue from acute and chronic hepatitis B virus carriers to establish whether the defect in interferon-alpha production reported in chronic hepatitis B virus infection is at a pretranscriptional or posttranscriptional level using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques. Interferon-alpha messenger RNA transcripts and the immunoreactive protein were abundant in liver tissue and in particular in hepatocytes from patients with acute hepatitis B virus infection who subsequently recovered. In contrast interferon-alpha polypeptide was present in a significantly lower number of sinusoidal cells, mononuclear cells and hepatocytes in chronic hepatitis B virus carriers. Although a high proportion of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection had cells that expressed interferon-alpha messenger RNA transcripts, the number of such cells was significantly less than in acute hepatitis B virus infection, indicating that the defect in the hepatic interferon-alpha synthesis is at the level of gene activation. Furthermore, using double immunohistochemical staining, the number of hepatocytes containing HBcAg correlated inversely with the proportion of neighboring sinusoidal cells expressing interferon-alpha. These data support previous observations that interferon-alpha production is reduced in chronic hepatitis B virus infection and are consistent with the view that this cytokine is important in the clearance of the virus. 
Stress hormones and acid-base status of human fetuses at delivery. The relationship of plasma concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP), ACTH, cortisol, and PRL in the human fetus to mode of delivery and acid-base status has been investigated in 91 term pregnancies consisting of 4 groups based on mode of delivery, type of anesthesia, and use of ephedrine prophylaxis for maternal blood pressure control. Infants delivered vaginally after uncomplicated labors had higher umbilical cord plasma concentrations of AVP, ACTH, and cortisol than infants delivered without labor. Use of ephedrine, an alpha-agonist, during regional anesthesia was associated with elevated plasma AVP and ACTH concentrations compared to those in women receiving general anesthesia. At the time of delivery, 12 infants had acidemia (pH less than 7.20), as judged by pH of umbilical arterial blood. Their plasma AVP, ACTH, and cortisol levels did not differ from those of infants delivered by uncomplicated vaginal delivery, but were greater than those of infants delivered by cesarean section under general anesthesia. Moreover, in infants with acidemia, plasma concentrations of AVP and ACTH were significantly correlated, but PRL levels were unaffected by mode of delivery or acidemia. Elevated umbilical cord plasma concentrations of AVP, ACTH, and cortisol characterize term vaginal deliveries and are associated with intrauterine stress, demonstrating activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and suggesting that AVP is important in ACTH release in the human fetus; however, PRL does not appear to be an important stress hormone. 
Cauda equina compression associated with breast cancer. A case study in differential diagnosis. The determination of the etiology of spinal cord compression in cancer patients is essential for appropriate therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are not immune to the development of superimposed nonmalignant disease. Although metastatic epidural compression may occur in up to 9% of breast cancer patients, care must be taken to rule out other nonmetastatic lesions causing compression. The association of concurrent breast carcinoma and a spinal neurilemoma simulating a metastatic lesion seems not to have been previously reported. A neurilemoma was observed in a 50-year-old woman. A neurilemoma suspected to be a metastatic lesion may produce the clinical features of pain, neurologic deficit, and weakness. Differentiation will be aided by roentgenograms, radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography, and possible magnetic resonance imaging. Radiologic differentiation hinges on the recognition and the slow-growing nature and noninvasive boundaries of the nonmalignant lesion. Ultimate verification is by biopsy. Treatment should consist of neurectomy, if severely symptomatic, and stabilization as indicated. 
A case of adult T cell leukemia complicated by proliferative synovitis. A 60-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with symmetrical arthritis of the knees. During the 2 years preceding admission, she had experienced recurrent arthritis. A histological examination of her synovial tissue showed prominent villous proliferation of the synovial cells, prominent vascularity throughout and an inflammatory infiltrate composed of abnormal mononuclear cells. Three months later, she developed fever, skin eruptions, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. She also had hypercalcemia and there was abnormal lymphocytosis in her blood smears. She was diagnosed as having adult T cell leukemia. Parenteral chemotherapy treatment with adriamycin and cyclophosphamide gave remission of all the manifestations of disease, including arthritis. Her leukemia recurred, however, and she died 6 months after the diagnosis was made. 
Optimal dosing interval for penicillin treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis. One-hundred-forty-two children with symptomatic pharyngitis had throat cultures positive for group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHA). All were treated orally with penicillin V for ten days. Patients were randomly assigned to receive daily doses of 250 mg four times daily, 500 mg twice daily, or 1000 mg once daily. They were followed four weeks for either recurrent symptomatic pharyngitis or asymptomatic repeat positive throat culture. Patients treated two or four times daily had comparable outcomes. Children given penicillin once daily were more likely to have persistent positive culture after 48 hours treatment (5 of 48 or 10.4% vs. none of 94, p = .004) and more likely to have recurrent positive cultures after end of treatment (10 of 43 or 23% vs. 8 of 94 or 8%, p = .04). The treatment regime of penicillin V 500 mg twice daily is recommended for treatment of pharyngitis due to GABHS. 
Relationship between glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of islet cells in chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. This study was conducted to clarify the relationship between indicators of preoperative glucose tolerance and quantitative changes of endocrine cells in the islet of Langerhans in patients with chronic obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer. Twenty-one specimens of pancreatic tissue obtained from patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy for pancreatoduodenal cancer were divided into four groups according to the degree of fibrosis (Grades 0-III). Islet cells in serial sections were stained immunohistochemically to determine the proportions of B-, A-, D-, and PP-cells in the islets of Langerhans. In patients with pancreatic tissue with the most severe fibrosis, of several preoperative glucose metabolism indices measured, it was found that the ratio of integrated value of change in serum insulin to that of serum glucose (sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS) was significantly decreased. There was a significant positive correlation between proportion of B-cells, and both the ratio of change in insulin to that of glucose (delta IRI:delta BS) and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. On the other hand, there was a significant negative correlation between proportion of A-cells and sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS. The present data strongly suggest that it is possible to estimate the degree of fibrosis and to quantify changes of the islet cells prior to surgery in patients with obstructive pancreatitis due to pancreatoduodenal cancer by calculating these glucose metabolism indices, and that sigma delta IRI:sigma delta BS is a particularly useful index. 
Central sleep apnea and arterial compression of the medulla. We report a 5-year-old with central sleep apnea associated with compression of the medulla oblongata by abnormal looping of the left vertebral artery. The magnetic resonance imaging findings raise the possibility that compression of the respiratory center by an aberrant vertebral artery might cause central sleep apnea. 
Transvaginal ultrasonography versus hysteroscopy in the diagnosis of uterine submucous myomas. Seventy-one women with symptomatic uterine myomas, hospitalized for hysterectomy, underwent preoperative transvaginal ultrasonography and hysteroscopy to compare their reliability in the diagnosis of submucous myomas. After the operation, the surgical specimen was studied carefully and the results were compared with the preoperative diagnostic findings. Transvaginal ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94%; the predictive value of an abnormal ultrasound scan was 81% and that of a normal one was 100%. The sensitivity of hysteroscopy was 100% and the specificity 96%; the predictive value of an abnormal hysteroscopic finding was 87% and that of a normal result was 100%. Mapping of uterine myomas is more precise with transvaginal ultrasonography than with hysteroscopy, but the former method cannot distinguish between a myoma and an endometrial polyp. 
Mild cognitive impairment in the elderly: predictors of dementia. We conducted full diagnostic evaluations, including a comprehensive cognitive assessment battery, of a group of 32 elderly subjects with a clinically identified mild cognitive impairment and a group of 32 age-matched and education-matched normal subjects. The mildly impaired subjects performed significantly more poorly than the controls on tests of recent memory, remote memory, language function, concept formation, and visuospatial praxis. Follow-up evaluations of cognitive status 2 years later revealed clinically detectable cognitive decline relative baseline in 23 (72%) of the mildly impaired subjects. Several of the objective psychological tests accurately discriminated at baseline between the decliners and nondecliners in the mildly impaired group. Among the 20 mildly impaired subjects with no complicating conditions, 16 exhibited cognitive deterioration between baseline and follow-up. These results suggest that most elderly subjects with mild cognitive deficits, as determined by clinical evaluation and objective psychological testing, will manifest the progressive mental deterioration characteristic of dementia and that psychometric predictors can be used to distinguish between benign and more significant underlying disorders in mildly impaired elderly subjects. 
Two-step model of leukocyte-endothelial cell interaction in inflammation: distinct roles for LECAM-1 and the leukocyte beta 2 integrins in vivo. The lectin homing receptor LECAM-1 (LAM-1, Leu8) and the beta 2 integrins, particularly Mac-1 (CD11b/CD18), participate in leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions in inflammation. LECAM-1 is rapidly shed while Mac-1 expression is dramatically increased upon neutrophil activation, suggesting functionally distinct roles for these molecules. Using intravital video microscopy, we have compared the effect of antibodies against LECAM-1 and CD18 on leukocyte interactions with rabbit mesenteric venules. Anti-LECAM-1 monoclonal antibody and its Fab fragments inhibited initial reversible leukocyte rolling along the vascular wall. Anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody had no effect on rolling but prevented subsequent firm attachment of leukocytes to venular endothelium. These results support a two-step model of leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions: reversible rolling mediated in part by LECAM-1 facilitates leukocyte recruitment by the local microenvironment and precedes activation-dependent firm attachment involving beta 2 integrins. 
The spleen in the spleen syndrome: the association of splenoma with hematopoietic and neoplastic disease--compendium of cases since 1864. Splenomas have been described as benign congenital growths. We report six cases of splenomas, all in males. Three had hairy cell leukemia, one had Hodgkin's disease, and one had myeloid metaplasia. Average splenic weight was 1629 gm, and all had multiple splenomas (average diameter 1.89 cm). Splenomas bulged above the cut splenic surface, were pseudoencapsulated, and showed involvement of the underlying disease. A re-evaluation of 105 prior cases are adult (86%; age: 49), with 56% associated with neoplastic disease or hematologic abnormalities. Average spleen weight was 626 gm, and 22% contained multiple splenomas. We conclude that splenomas are most likely an acquired proliferative process strongly associated with neoplastic disease or hematologic abnormalities. Splenomas can also be congenital growths (hamartoma; 26% of the series), which are of little importance. 
The use of an intraluminal shunt for bypass grafts of the cavernous internal carotid artery. Technical note. The authors describe an indwelling intraluminal shunt for use during graft bypass procedures of the cavernous internal carotid artery. The clinical use of this shunt in a patient with meningioma invading the right cavernous sinus is described. This shunt has also been found applicable during carotid endarterectomy, and should prove to be a useful addition to the neurosurgical armamentarium for skull-base surgery. 
Depressed aerobic enzyme activity of skeletal muscle in severe chronic heart failure. A reduction in exercise capacity is a common feature of congestive heart failure. We hypothesized that depressed aerobic enzyme activity of skeletal muscle may contribute to this exercise intolerance. Biopsy samples of vastus lateralis muscle were obtained from seven patients with severe chronic heart failure and analyzed for aerobic enzyme activity. Compared with normal laboratory controls, the patients with heart failure had a moderate reduction (greater than 60%) in skeletal muscle citrate synthase and a marked reduction (greater than 90%) in succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase (all p less than 0.001). Depression of aerobic enzyme activity of skeletal muscle is associated with severe chronic heart failure and is likely one of the contributory factors for impaired exercise capacity seen in the advanced stages of this condition. 
A case of opisthorchiasis diagnosed by cholangiography and bile examination. A case of symptomatic opisthorchiasis in a 66-year-old Laotian immigrant is presented. The diagnosis was made by transhepatic cholangiography and by finding the trematode eggs in bile fluid. The characteristic cholangiographic changes of opisthorchiasis are described, including the intraluminal filling defects, the diffuse irregular dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, and the abrupt endings of the terminal branches. The importance of microscopic examination of the bile is stressed especially when stool examination is negative. 
Hemodynamic and clinical benefits with intravenous milrinone in severe chronic heart failure: results of a multicenter study in the United States. The response of patients with chronic severe heart failure to extended infusions (greater than or equal to 48 hours) of milrinone was evaluated in a multicenter, baseline-controlled, phase III efficacy and safety trial in 189 patients in the United States. Milrinone was given as loading and maintenance infusions according to one of four dose regimens. An effective response was defined as greater than or equal to 20% increases in cardiac index or decreases in pulmonary wedge pressure. All loading doses (range, 37.5 to 75 micrograms/kg/10 min) were effective short term, and maximum response occurred at 15 minutes. For the three effective regimens, cardiac index increased initially (at 15 minutes) by 24% to 42%, and pulmonary wedge pressure decreased by 24% to 33%. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 15% to 31%. The maximal acute response was effective in 99% of individual patients. During maintenance therapy, effective responses were seen at infusion doses of 0.375, 0.50, and 0.75 micrograms/kg/min, whereas an infusion of 0.25 micrograms/kg/min was ineffective. During 2 days of maintenance therapy, cardiac index remained augmented by 34% to 39% for the low and intermediate doses and by 44% to 73% for the high-dose infusion regimen. Pulmonary wedge pressure decreased an average of 18% on day 1 and 30% on day 2. Systemic vascular resistance was reduced by 20% to 25%, and stroke work index was augmented by 21% to 58%. Symptomatic improvement was common during intravenous milrinone therapy for symptoms of dyspnea (61% response), orthopnea (63%), edema (62%), and fatigue (40%). Improvement occurred more frequently in those with worse baseline functional indexes and in those with greater hemodynamic responses to therapy. Safety and tolerance were exceptionally good for these patients with advanced heart failure. 
Ubiquitin-immunoreactive intraneuronal inclusions in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Morphology, distribution, and specificity. Antibodies to ubiquitin have been used to search for evidence of abnormal protein degradation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis--motor neuron disease (ALS). Anterior horn cell ubiquitin-immunoreactive (IR) inclusions were present in all of 31 ALS cases but in none of 23 neurologically normal and in only 1 of 22 neurologically abnormal controls. These inclusions, which were present in familial and sporadic ALS cases, and in cases with dementia, took the form of dense rounded or irregular ubiquitin-IR cytoplasmic inclusions (dense bodies), or loosely arranged bundles ('skeins') of filamentous-appearing material. The presence of ubiquitin-IR inclusions corresponded to the pattern of selective neuronal vulnerability in ALS, although inclusions in pyramidal neurons of the motor cortex were infrequent and were noted in only a minority of cases. Ubiquitin-IR inclusions were more prevalent than Bunina bodies. The latter were present in 67% of ALS cases but were seldom labelled by antibodies to ubiquitin. Intraneuronal inclusions resembling Lewy bodies were present in 23% of ALS cases and were often identified by antibodies to ubiquitin. We conclude that the presence of ubiquitin-IR inclusions in lower motor neurons represents a characteristic pathological feature of ALS in its various clinical forms. Ubiquitin-IR inclusions in ALS differ from ubiquitinated inclusions in other neuronal degenerations in that they are not readily identified by antibodies to cytoskeletal proteins. They may represent accumulations of altered or abnormal neuronal proteins resistant to degradation via the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway. 
Cerebral infarction verified by cranial computed tomography and prognosis for survival following transient ischemic attack. Of 564 consecutive patients with transient ischemic attack, 350 (62%) had cranial computed tomography performed. Except for date of admission and smoking history, there were few differences between the patients evaluated with computed tomography and the 214 who were not. Cerebral infarcts were found in 59 (17%) of the 350 tomographic evaluations. Previous clinically diagnosed stroke, older age, and male sex were all significantly associated with the occurrence of tomographically verified infarcts (p less than 0.05). After controlling for stroke history and other important covariates, patients with tomographically verified infarcts had significantly shorter survival times than did patients without evidence of infarction on computed tomography (p = 0.035). Thus, cranial computed tomography findings appear to have important prognostic value for estimating survival following transient ischemic attack. 
Coexpression of adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor, a human thioredoxin homologue, and human papillomavirus DNA in neoplastic cervical squamous epithelium. Adult T-cell leukemia-derived factor (ADF) is an autocrine interleukin-2 receptor-inducing factor produced by human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1)-transformed lymphocytes, which has a high structural homology with an endogenous dithiol reducing coenzyme, thioredoxin. Its localization was investigated immunohistochemically in the cervix, using normal tissue (27 samples) and squamous neoplastic tissue (three condylomas, 42 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [CIN] samples, 34 invasive squamous cell carcinoma samples). The expression of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was also studied in serial sections of the same subjects. Normal squamous cells and glandular cells of the cervix were negative for ADF. However, intracytoplasmic and/or intranuclear ADF-positive cells were usually found in the intermediate and superficial layers of the neoplastic squamous epithelium of condylomas (three of three cases) and CIN (35/42 cases). HPV DNA was detected in all condylomas and in 27 of 42 CIN specimens. HPV DNA-positive cells were usually localized in the intermediate and superficial layers of the neoplastic squamous epithelium. These HPV DNA-positive cells were also positive for ADF. Invasive squamous cell carcinoma was also positive for ADF (24/34 cases) and HPV DNA (11/34 cases). The coexpression of HPV DNA and ADF was observed in all HPV DNA-positive cases. Coexistence of HPV DNA and ADF immunopositivity in neoplastic squamous cells of the cervix suggests that ADF expression closely reflects the intracellular event on HPV DNA replication. 
Risk stratification for arrhythmic events in postinfarction patients based on heart rate variability, ambulatory electrocardiographic variables and the signal-averaged electrocardiogram. The value of heart rate variability, ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) variables and the signal-averaged ECG in the prediction of arrhythmic events (sudden death or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias) was assessed before hospital discharge in 416 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the follow-up period (range 1 to 1,112 days), there were 24 arrhythmic events and 47 deaths. The initial relation between several prognostic factors and arrhythmic events was explored with use of the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of survival function. Impaired heart rate variability less than 20 ms (p less than 0.0000), late potentials (p less than 0.0000), ventricular ectopic beat frequency (p less than 0.0000), repetitive ventricular forms (p less than 0.0000), left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% (p less than 0.02) and Killip class (p less than 0.02) were identified as significant univariate predictors of arrhythmic events. When these variables were analyzed by using a stepwise Cox regression model, only impaired heart rate variability, followed by late potentials and repetitive ventricular forms remained independent predictors of arrhythmic events. The combination of impaired heart rate variability and late potentials had a sensitivity of 58%, a positive predictive accuracy of 33% and a relative risk of 18.5 for arrhythmic events and was superior to other combinations including those incorporating left ventricular function, exercise ECG, ventricular ectopic beat frequency and repetitive ventricular forms. These results suggest that a simple method of assessment based on heart rate variability and the signal-averaged ECG can select a small subgroup of survivors of myocardial infarction at high risk of future life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death. 
Differing characteristics of human papillomavirus RNA-positive and RNA-negative anal carcinomas. Anal carcinomas were tested for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) RNA transcripts by in situ hybridization using 125I-labeled RNA probes. The HPV transcripts were detected in 73.2% of 41 nonglandular anal carcinomas but in none of six anal or 11 rectal adenocarcinomas. In anal nonglandular carcinomas, no difference in the percentage of tumors that were HPV RNA positive was observed between tumors classed as basaloid carcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas. Patients with HPV RNA-negative tumors were significantly older (9.2 years) than those with HPV RNA-positive tumors. Anal intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 in the surrounding epithelium was seen in 14 of 25 assessable HPV RNA-positive tumors and in none of nine assessable HPV RNA-negative tumors. Anal tumors may include two separate clinical and biologic groups distinguished by their dependence, or lack of dependence, on HPV RNA expression for maintenance of the neoplastic state. 
High-speed memory scanning in Parkinson's disease: adverse effects of levodopa. High-speed memory scanning as assessed by the Sternberg paradigm was studied in 12 nondemented patients with fluctuating Parkinson's disease and 13 age-matched healthy controls. Patients were first assessed before taking their morning dose of levodopa ("off") and again after that dose had produced full clinical effect ("on") after that dose had produced full clinical effect ("on"). Although motor components of the measured choice reaction time were slower in patients when off than in control subjects, memory scanning speed was not different. After levodopa (on), patients' motor time normalized, but cognitive processing speed became significantly slower when compared with previous performance in the off condition and with controls. Contrary to previous concepts of bradyphrenia in patients with Parkinson's disease, these results indicate that dopaminergic stimulation can reduce cognitive processing speed. 
A rare cause of parastomal hernia: stomach herniation. Our case of a parastomal hernia is rare because the stomach became incarcerated in the hernial sac. The diagnosis of parastomal hernia is not a difficult one, but one must be aware of the possible complications of the colostomy and the rare occurrence of the parastomal hernia containing the stomach. 
Thymosin treatment of chronic hepatitis B: a placebo-controlled pilot trial Chronic hepatitis B is a severe and frequently progressive disease. We assessed the safety and efficacy of thymosin fraction 5 and thymosin-alpha 1 in a prospective, placebo-controlled trial in 12 patients with chronic hepatitis B. All patients had histological and biochemical evidence of active liver disease for at least 6 mo before treatment and were positive for serum hepatitis B virus DNA and HBsAg. Seven patients received thymosin fraction 5 or thymosin-alpha 1 and five patients received placebo twice weekly for 6 mo. By the conclusion of the study (1 yr), serum aminotransferase levels had improved significantly in thymosin-treated patients, but not in the placebo group. Six (86%) of the thymosin treated patients and one (20%) patient given placebo cleared hepatitis B virus DNA from serum (p less than 0.04, Fisher's exact test). After treatment, replicative forms of hepatitis B virus DNA were present in the liver specimens of four of five placebo-treated patients but in only one of seven thymosin-treated patients (p less than 0.04, Fisher's exact test). Response to thymosin therapy was associated with significant improvements in peripheral blood lymphocyte and CD3 and CD4 counts and in in vitro production of interferon-gamma over initial values. No significant side effects were observed in patients given thymosin or in placebo-treated patients. Clinical, biochemical and serological improvement in patients responding to thymosin were sustained during 26 +/- 3 mo of follow-up. The results of this pilot trial suggest that thymosin therapy promotes disease remission and cessation of hepatitis B virus replication in patients with chronic viral infection. 
Anterior cruciate ligament allograft transplantation in dogs. The biomechanical and clinical performance of bone-ligament-bone anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) allografts was studied in eight dogs. Allografts were collected from skeletally mature, healthy dogs using aseptic technique, and stored at -70 degrees for three to five weeks before implantation. The allografts were size-matched to the recipient dogs using ACL length and then rigidly fixed in position with interference screws and Kirschner wires. Three dogs regained a normal gait, and their grafts sustained breaking loads that were 25%, 41%, and 59% of controls. Partial or complete graft failure occurred in the other five dogs at some point in the study. Four had intraligamentous rupture and one had an avulsion fracture of the femoral attachment site. Joint-fluid cytology was normal in all eight dogs. Histologic examination showed persistent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Eventually the allograft cores were incorporated in the host bed. Hyperplasia and fibrosis of the synovial membrane were diffuse and persisted as focal accumulations of mononuclear inflammatory cells. 
Influence of allopurinol on cardiac complications in open heart operations. During cardiac operations, the heart is subjected to total ischemia and reperfusion, causing serious operative and postoperative complications such as arrhythmias, heart failure, and infarctions that may be partly due to free radical generation. Thus, allopurinol was tested to see if it could reduce cardiac complications during open heart operations. Ninety patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting were studied prospectively. Fortyfive patients were treated with allopurinol and 45 patients acted as controls. Treatment requiring arrhythmias in the allopurinol group was 6.6% compared with 33.3% in the control group (p less than 0.01). The percentage of patients requiring inotropes was significantly lower in the allopurinol group than in the control group (4.4% versus 26.6%; p less than 0.01). Perioperative myocardial infarction did not occur in the allopurinol group but was seen in 8 patients (17.7%) in the control group. Intraaortic balloon pumping was used in 5 control patients (11.1%) but not in the allopurinol group. This study shows that allopurinol decreases significantly the incidence of cardiac complications in open heart operations. 
Osmotic diarrhea induced by sugar-free theophylline solution in critically ill patients. It is widely accepted that early enteral nutrition is beneficial to critically ill patients. Diarrhea is a common problem in this setting and is often erroneously ascribed to enteral feedings. More often medications cause the diarrhea. Multiple cases of severe diarrhea associated with the use of a sugar-free theophylline solution (SFTS) were discovered by a nutrition support team. SFTS may induce an osmotic diarrhea because it contains sorbitol. A 55-year-old man admitted for a dissecting aneurysm was started on isotonic formula enteral feedings and within a day of starting SFTS developed severe diarrhea. The sorbitol-induced osmotic diarrhea persisted for 36 of his 83 days of hospitalization with direct cost for the evaluation of this diarrhea being $4,250. His prolonged hospitalization cost $166,200. A retrospective review of 20 consecutive patients receiving SFTS revealed that 15 patients had diarrhea for 2 or more consecutive days compared with 20 patients receiving iv aminophylline, of whom only two patients had diarrhea. Furthermore, SFTS was administered to healthy volunteers and a prominent breath hydrogen response was noted. The polyalcohol sorbitol is used as a sweetner in "sugar-free" products and not quantified on labeling because it is considered an inactive ingredient. Nutritionists should be aware that medicinal solutions can contain enough sorbitol to create a laxative effect which is an easily reversible cause of diarrhea in enterally fed patients. 
Differentiation of a human eosinophilic leukemia cell line (EoL-1) by a human T-cell leukemia cell line (HIL-3)-derived factor. Differentiation of a human eosinophilic leukemia cell line, EoL-1, induced by the culture supernatant of a human ATL cell line, HIL-3 (HIL-3 sup) was compared with differentiation induced by defined cytokines. HIL-3 sup induced EoL-1 cells to express eosinophilic granules and segmented nuclei after 6 to 9 days of incubation. HIL-3 sup also induced the expression of Fc epsilon receptor II (Fc epsilon RII/CD23) and an eosinophil differentiation antigen EO-1 mainly on eosinophilic granule (+) cells. Furthermore, HIL-3 sup induced EoL-1 cells to respond to an eosinophil chemotactic factor, platelet activating factor. HIL-3 cells express messenger RNA (mRNA) of interleukin-5 (IL-5), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and IL-3 but not granulocyte CSF (G-CSF). Granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were detected in the HIL-3 sup. Recombinant IL-2 (rIL-2), rIL-3, rIL-4, rIL-5, rM-CSF, and rGM-CSF did not induce eosinophilic granules. rG-CSF induced a few eosinophilic granule (+) cells, and TNF-alpha, which did not induce eosinophilic granules by itself, enhanced the ability of G-CSF to induce them. However, G-CSF and TNF-alpha did not induce the expression of Fc epsilon RII and EO-1 antigen. Moreover, anti-G-CSF, anti-TNF-alpha, anti-GM-CSF, anti-IL-3, and anti-IL-5 antibodies did not suppress the effect of HIL-3 sup on the differentiation of EoL-1 cells. All the data suggest that HIL-3 sup contains an unidentified factor that induces differentiation of EoL-1 cells, and that EoL-1 cells and HIL-3 sup provide an important model for the examination of differentiation mechanisms and functions of eosinophils. 
Cloning of a leucine-zipper protein recognized by the sera of patients with antibody-associated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. Antibody-associated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (the Yo syndrome) is an uncommon disorder in which an immune response is specifically directed against tumor tissue and the cerebellum. Screening of a lambda expression library has resulted in the isolation of cDNA clones that encode the major antigen recognized by serum from these patients. The fusion protein produced by the cDNA clones provides the basis of a simple diagnostic assay for this neurological syndrome. The occurrence of leucine-zipper and zinc-finger motifs in the predicted open reading frame suggests that this protein plays a role in the regulation of gene expression. 
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy presenting as multiple intracranial lesions on magnetic resonance imaging. Case report. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is recognized as an important cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage in the elderly normotensive patient. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of this disease entity are rarely mentioned in the literature. The MR imaging findings of an elderly normotensive patient presenting with an acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage secondary to amyloid angiopathy are reported and a brief review of amyloidosis is presented. 
Singular neurectomy update. II. Review of 102 cases. During the past 18 years, 102 singular neurectomies (SN) were performed on 95 patients with chronic cupulolithiasis of the posterior canal sense organ. Bilateral sequential singular neurectomies were performed in 7 patients and unilateral singular neurectomies in 88 patients. Ninety-nine (97%) of the 102 singular neurectomies completely eliminated the positional nystagmus and vertigo produced by the involved (undermost) ear in the Hallpike maneuver. Following three singular neurectomies (3%), there was improvement but incomplete relief from the positional nystagmus. A sensorineural hearing loss caused by the singular neurectomies occurred in four patients (4%). A thorough knowledge of the surgical and histologic anatomy of the round window niche and singular canal, together with the use of local anesthesia to allow monitoring of a vestibular response to singular neurectomy are essential for effectiveness and safety. 
Elevated serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha after bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage are often followed by the development of fever and other influenza-like symptoms. We report the onset of these symptoms in a healthy volunteer following bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage; the symptoms were temporally associated with the dramatic elevation of serum levels of tumor necrosis factor. Our observations suggest that tumor necrosis factor may be involved in mediating fever and other influenza-like symptoms occurring after bronchoscopy. 
Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis. Analysis of 63 cases. We retrospectively analyzed 63 observations collected in nine French departments of dermatology of an acute pustular dermatosis, recently named in the French literature acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). Even though 11 of these cases occurred in patients with a history of psoriasis, AGEP appeared distinct from pustular psoriasis based on several slight pathologic differences, drug induction in most cases, and a more acute course of fever and pustulosis, with rapid spontaneous healing. We, therefore, suggest that AGEP is a reaction pattern, perhaps favored by a "psoriatic background." The most frequent causes of AGEP seem to be drug reactions, acute infections with enteroviruses, and hypersensitivity to mercury. With 55 (87%) of 63 cases attributed to drugs in this series, AGEP should be added to the list of cutaneous adverse drug reactions. Among drug-induced skin eruptions, AGEP is remarkable by its short time to onset after the administration of the suspected drug (less than 24 hours in half of our cases) and the great predominance (80%) of antibiotics as causative agents. It is suggested that some cases previously reported as "drug-induced pustular psoriasis" were in fact AGEP. 
Nonsense mutations affect C1 inhibitor messenger RNA levels in patients with type I hereditary angioneurotic edema. Members of two unrelated families with type I hereditary angioneurotic edema (HANE) were found to have elevated levels of C1 inhibitor (C1INH) mRNA. DNA sequence analysis of PCR-amplified monocyte C1INH mRNA revealed normal and mutant transcripts, as expected in this disorder that occurs in heterozygous individuals. Single base mutations near the 3' end of the coding sequence were identified in affected members of each family. One mutation consisted of insertion of an adenosine at position 1304 which created a premature termination codon (TAA), whereas the second consisted of deletion of the thymidine at position 1298 which created a premature termination codon (TGA) 23 nucleotides downstream. These mutations are approximately 250 nucleotides upstream of the natural termination codon. Nuclear run-off experiments in one kindred revealed no difference in transcription rates of the C1INH gene between the patients and normals. C1INH mRNA half-life experiments were not technically feasible because of the prolonged half-life of the normal transcript. Dideoxynucleotide primer extension experiments allowed the differentiation of the normal and mutant transcripts. These studies showed that the mutant transcript was not decreased relative to the normal, and this therefore was at least partially responsible for the C1INH mRNA elevation. This elevation may be due to the decreased catabolism of the mutant transcript. 
Neoadjuvant cisplatin plus vinblastine chemotherapy in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Twenty-eight patients with locally advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) received neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin (120 mg/m2 on days 1 and 29) and vinblastine (4 mg/m2 weekly for 6 weeks). At the completion of induction chemotherapy, all patients were assessed for resectability. Those patients judged to be resectable underwent thoracotomy. All remaining patients received thoracic radiation therapy (5500 cGy) followed by additional chemotherapy in those patients responding to neoadjuvant treatment. There were 15 partial responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for an overall response rate of 54% (95% confidence interval, 36% to 71%). Only five partially responding patients (18%) were thought to have had sufficient tumor regression to allow for a potentially curative resection. However, a complete resection was done in only two patients. Overall median survival was 12 months (range, 4 to 72 months) with 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year survival rates of 54%, 39%, and 11%, respectively. The primary toxicity associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy was moderate to severe (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Grade 3 or 4) nausea and emesis in 25% of patients. Hematologic toxicity was relatively modest; only one patient had Grade 4 leukopenia (less than 1000/microliter). Fever and neutropenia were uncommon, and there were no documented septic episodes or treatment-related deaths. Compared with historic controls treated with radiation therapy alone, cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy appeared to improve the median and long-term survival of Stage III NSCLC patients modestly. 
Twenty-seven nonoverlapping zinc finger cDNAs from human T cells map to nine different chromosomes with apparent clustering. cDNA clones encoding zinc finger structures were isolated by screening Molt4 and Jurkat cDNA libraries with zinc finger consensus sequences. Candidate clones were partially sequenced to verify the presence of zinc finger-encoding regions; nonoverlapping cDNA clones were chosen on the basis of sequences and genomic hybridization pattern. Zinc finger structure-encoding clones, which were designated by the term "Kox" and a number from 1 to 32 and which were apparently unique (i.e., distinct from each other and distinct from those isolated by other laboratories), were chosen for mapping in the human genome. DNAs from rodent-human somatic cell hybrids retaining defined complements of human chromosomes were analyzed for the presence of each of the Kox genes. Correlation between the presence of specific human chromosome regions and specific Kox genes established the chromosomal locations. Multiple Kox loci were mapped to 7q (Kox 18 and 25 and a locus detected by both Kox 8 cDNA and Kox 27 cDNA), 8q24 5' to the myc locus (Kox 9 and 32), 10cen----q24 (Kox 2, 15, 19, 21, 30, and 31), 12q13-qter (Kox 1 and 20), 17p13 (Kox 11 and 26), and 19q (Kox 5, 6, 10, 22, 24, and 28). Single Kox loci were mapped to 7p22 (Kox 3), 18q12 (Kox 17), 19p (Kox 13), 22q11 between IG lambda and BCR-1 (locus detected by both Kox 8 cDNA and Kox 27 cDNA), and Xp (Kox 14). Several of the Kox loci map to regions in which other zinc finger structure-encoding loci have already been localized, indicating possible zinc finger gene clusters. In addition, Kox genes at 8q24, 17p13, and 22q11--and perhaps other Kox genes--are located near recurrent chromosomal translocation breakpoints. Others, such as those on 7p and 7q, may be near regions specifically active in T cells. 
Aberrant central venous catheter complicating radical neck dissection. Abnormal migration of central venous catheters is especially common in the case of long lines inserted via the antecubital fossa. A case is described of internal jugular vein migration of a central venous catheter complicating an ipsilateral radical neck dissection. 
Delayed decline in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels after an abrupt reduction in atrial pressures: observation in patients with dual-chamber pacing. The effect of an abrupt reduction in atrial pressures on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion was studied in four patients with complete atrioventricular block with a dual-chamber pacemaker when the pacing mode was changed from the VVI to the DVI mode at an equal rate of 70/min. Simultaneous continuous hemodynamic monitoring was performed using a balloon-tipped thermodilution catheter. With DVI pacing, there was an immediate decrease of right atrial pressure from 4.5 +/- 0.9 to 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, and a reduction of pulmonary arterial wedge pressure from 7 +/- 0.8 to 4.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, together with a rise in cardiac output from 3.1 +/- 0.2 to 3.7 +/- 0.2 L/min. However, despite a constant hemodynamic status after dual-chamber pacing, the arterial ANP level steadily decreased from 151 +/- 26 pg/ml to a steady low level of 78 +/- 15 pg/ml after 20 minutes of dual-chamber pacing (percentage reduction- 48 +/- 8%, p less than 0.05). This persisted until the end of the study at 60 minutes. The time-dependent decay in ANP secretion after an abrupt and constant change in hemodynamic status should be considered when interpreting ANP levels. 
Comparison of the effects of streptokinase and tissue plasminogen activator on regional wall motion after first myocardial infarction: analysis by the centerline method with correction for area at risk. In a trial of streptokinase versus recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) for a first myocardial infarction, 270 patients were randomized. Regional left ventricular function was assessed in 214 patients at 3 weeks. The infarct-related artery was the left anterior descending artery in 78 patients, the right coronary artery in 122 and a dominant left circumflex artery in 14. Analysis was by the centerline method with a novel correction for the area of myocardium at risk, whereby the search region was determined by the anatomic distribution of the infarct-related artery. Infarct-artery patency at 3 weeks was 73% in the streptokinase group and 71% in the rt-PA group. Global left ventricular function did not differ between the two groups. Mean chord motion (+/- SD) in the most hypokinetic half of the defined search region was similar in the streptokinase and rt-PA groups (-2.4 +/- 1.5 versus -2.3 +/- 1.3, p = 0.63). There were no differences in hyperkinesia of the noninfarct zone. Compared with conventional centerline analysis, regional wall motion in the defined area at risk was significantly more abnormal. The two methods correlated strongly, however (r = 0.99, p less than 0.0001), and both methods produced similar overall results. Patients with a patent infarct-related artery and those with an occluded artery at the time of catheterization had similar levels of global function (ejection fraction 58 +/- 12% versus 57 +/- 12%, p = 0.58). 
Modified Rambo meatoplasty in translabyrinthine tumor removal. Spinal fluid otorrhea and otorhinorrhea are morbid complications that occur in up to 18% of patients after removal of translabyrinthine tumor. Both of these problems can be significantly reduced if, during the initial surgery, the posterior canal wall is taken down and the tympanic membrane and external auditory canal skin are removed for better exposure of the eustachian tube orifice. The external auditory meatus can then be sealed by a previously described modification of the Rambo procedure. This additional procedure adds about 20 minutes to the surgery and presents a small risk of retained squamous epithelium. Fifty consecutive patients were divided into two equal groups and studied retrospectively. In group I, the patients underwent a modified Rambo meatoplasty at the time of the removal of their translabyrinthine tumor, whereas patients in group II had the tympanic orifice of their eustachian tube obstructed through the facial recess. Review of the postoperative course of these fifty patients indicated that the addition of the modified Rambo meatoplasty was justified by the overall reduction in morbidity and expense it provided. 
Cardiac toxicity 4 to 20 years after completing anthracycline therapy. OBJECTIVE.--To assess the cardiac status of long-term survivors of pediatric malignancies who received chemotherapy, including anthracyclines. DESIGN AND METHOD.-Patients were evaluated by echocardiogram from 4 to 20 years (median, 7 years) after completion of anthracyclines, with prospective and retrospective analysis. PATIENTS.--The consecutive sample of 201 patients had received a total anthracycline dose of 200 to 1275 mg/m2 (median, 450 mg/m2), and 51 patients had mediastinal radiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The overall incidence and severity of abnormal systolic cardiac function were determined for the entire cohort. Risk factors of total anthracycline dose, mediastinal radiotherapy, age during treatment, and length of follow-up were examined. RESULTS.--Twenty-three percent (47/201) of the cohort had abnormal cardiac function on noninvasive testing at long-term follow-up. Correlation between total cumulative dose, length of follow-up, and mediastinal irradiation with incidence of abnormalities was significant. Fifty-six patients were followed up for 10 years or more (median, 12 years), with a median anthracycline dose of 495 mg/m2. Thirty-eight percent (21/56) of these patients, compared with 18% (26/145) of patients evaluated after less than 10 years, had abnormal findings. Sixty-three percent of patients followed up for 10 years or more after receiving 500 mg/m2 or more of anthracyclines had abnormal findings. Nine of 201 patients had late symptoms, including cardiac failure and dysrhythmia, and three patients died suddenly. Microscopic examination of the myocardium on biopsy and autopsy revealed fibrosis. CONCLUSION.--The 23% incidence of late cardiac abnormalities warrants continued evaluation of patients after anthracyclines to guide patient care and the design of future chemotherapeutic protocols. 
Usefulness of ST-segment changes in greater than or equal to 2 leads on the emergency room electrocardiogram in either unstable angina pectoris or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction in predicting outcome. To determine the reliability of the admission electrocardiogram in predicting outcome in patients hospitalized for chest pain at rest, 90 patients were randomized into a trial of aspirin versus heparin in unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, and prospectively followed for 3 months. The emergency room admission electrocardiogram was analyzed for ST-segment deviation greater than or equal to 1 mm/lead and T-wave changes. Unfavorable outcomes were recurrent ischemic pain, myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization with angioplasty or surgery. In patients who underwent coronary arteriography, a myocardium in jeopardy score ranging from 0 to 10 was assigned, based on the number of vessels with a diameter stenosis greater than or equal to 70% and the location of the stenoses. Considering all 90 patients, an admission electrocardiogram with ST-segment deviation in greater than or equal to 2 leads had a positive predictive value for adverse clinical events of 79% and a negative predictive value of 64%. In the subset of patients without left ventricular hypertrophy and whose admission electrocardiograms were recorded during chest pain (62 of 90), the positive predictive value of ST deviation in greater than or equal to 2 leads improved to 89% and the negative value to 72%. Of the 62 patients, 53 underwent coronary arteriography. There was a positive linear correlation between the total number of leads with ST-segment deviation and the myocardium in jeopardy score (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001). 
Expression of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) isoforms in neuroblastoma. A comparative study on the expression of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in human neuroblastoma cell lines and tissues was undertaken. NCAMs are a family of closely related cell surface glycoproteins involved in cell-cell interactions. Using antibodies that recognise distinct epitopes on NCAM, their presence was shown in neuroblastoma, but these studies do not yield any information on the specific NCAM isoforms associated with the tumour. Western and Northern blot analyses were therefore carried out to characterise the NCAM isoforms in this neuroectodermal tumour. Western blot studies using the monoclonal antibody ERIC-1 showed that all human neuroblastoma cell lines tested expressed the 140 and 120 kilodalton isoforms of NCAM in their desialo state. Some of the cell lines also expressed NCAM-180. The data are corroborated by Northern blotting where a transcript of 7.4 kilobase pairs was identified only in lines expressing NCAM-180; the 6.7 and 5.4 kilobase pair transcripts coding for 140 and 120 kilodalton isoforms, respectively, were present in all the cell lines tested. The NCAM isoforms identified in neuroblastoma were also different from those found in adult and fetal brain tissue, suggesting that aberrations are expressed in the molecule during tumorigenesis. 
Adult polycystic disease of the liver. Adult polycystic liver disease (APLD) is a rare disorder of liver parenchyma occasionally requiring surgical treatment. Its association with adult polycystic kidney disease has meant that as renal dialysis has become widely available there is an increased number of patients surviving with cystic liver changes. Although usually asymptomatic, patients with APLD may present with abdominal pain or swelling. Liver function is not usually compromised and computed tomography or abdominal ultrasonography are the most useful investigations. The complications of cyst rupture, infection, cholangiocarcinoma and compression of surrounding structures are discussed. Surgical treatment remains controversial, and the options of cyst puncture, fenestration with or without hepatic resection, and liver transplantation are reviewed. 
Quantitative nailfold capillary microscopy in cutaneous and systemic lupus erythematosus and localized and systemic scleroderma. Quantitative television microscopy of nailfold capillaries of the fingers was performed in 12 patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (six with discoid type and six with disseminated type), in six patients with localized scleroderma (two with circumscribed type, two with linear types, and two with atrophic type), in 10 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and in eight patients with systemic scleroderma. The following features were analyzed and compared with a control group (n = 15) of similar age: venous plexus visibility; density of capillaries; avascular fields; hemorrhages; giant capillaries; diameters of the transitional segment, the arterial, and the venous limbs; loop width; and flow stop caused by local cooling test. The patient groups with cutaneous lesions only showed no essential differences as compared with the controls. Patients with systemic scleroderma differed in almost every finding from the controls and from patients with localized scleroderma. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus exhibited significant differences in several findings as compared with the controls and the cutaneous lupus erythematosus group, but there was overlap. 
The new 99mTc myocardial perfusion imaging agents: 99mTc-sestamibi and 99mTc-teboroxime. The two new 99m (99mTc) labeled myocardial perfusion agents, 99mTc-Sestamibi and 99mTc-Teboroxime, are now available for routine clinical application. Both agents allow assessment of ejection fraction by the first-pass technique at rest or during exercise, thus providing additional information not available with thallium-201. 99mTc-Sestamibi has long myocardial residence time, as well as adequate myocardial extraction, providing images of higher count density and superior quality compared with thallium-201. 99mTc-Teboroxime has excellent myocardial uptake characteristics but is cleared very rapidly from the myocardium. Both tracers have shown results similar to those obtained with thallium-201 for detection of coronary artery disease and the assessment of defect reversibility. 99mTc-Sestamibi studies using the rest/stress imaging sequence can be accomplished in approximately 5 hours; studies using dual-isotope imaging (rest thallium-201 and stress 99mTc-Sestamibi injection) can be completed in 1 to 2 hours. Gated stress images can be performed with 99mTc-Sestamibi, providing simultaneous information of myocardial perfusion at stress and resting wall motion or thickening and allowing rapid differentiation of ischemic from infarcted tissue. Because of its slow myocardial clearance and absence of redistribution, 99mTc-Sestamibi allows uncoupling of the time of injection from the time of imaging and thus can be valuable in the evaluation of acute myocardial infarction and outcome of thrombolytic therapy. With 99mTc-Teboroxime, rapid serial studies are feasible. Pharmacologic stress and rest studies with 99mTc-Teboroxime single photon emission computed tomography potentially can be completed in under 30 minutes. 
Basophil-bound and serum immunoglobulin E directed against Helicobacter pylori in patients with chronic gastritis. The immunoglobulin (Ig) E immune response in patients with Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis has been evaluated. Of 26 patients with H. pylori infection, 22 (84%) tested positive for basophil-bound specific IgE (determined by the histamine release test) and 18 (69%) for serum specific IgE (determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). In contrast, only 1 of 17 persons in whom the bacterium was not detected presented cell-bound and serum specific IgE. In the 4 histamine release test--positive but enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay--negative patients, removal of antibody from the basophil surface by acid elution showed that histamine release occurred through an IgE-dependent mechanism. When normal basophils, passively sensitized with serum from IgE-positive patients, were exposed to the H. pylori antigen, a significant release was observed, confirming the class specificity of the response. Inhibition experiments with bacteria other than H. pylori showed that the IgE antibody was specifically directed against this organism. The percentage of antigen-induced histamine release did not correlate with serum specific IgE level. However, the response of basophils to antigenic challenge was proportional to IgE-dependent cellular releasability. This finding suggests that target cell sensitivity may be the most important factor in determining the entity of biological response to the antigenic challenge. The ability of H. pylori to induce a specific IgE immune response could answer key questions regarding the mechanisms inducing gastric inflammation. 
Spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistulae in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV. Case report. Spontaneous bilateral carotid-cavernous fistulae and cervical artery dissection is reported in a 20-year-old woman with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV. The clinical features of 16 previously published cases of spontaneous carotid-cavernous fistulae associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type IV are reviewed, for a total of 17 cases. The mean age of the 14 women and three men was 31.6 years. Only direct fistulae were encountered. Diagnostic neuroangiography carried morbidity and mortality rates of 36% and 12%, respectively; neuroradiological treatment resulted in death in one of six patients. The possible value of desmopressin in the management of these patients is discussed. In view of the risks of arterial puncture and surgery, the authors emphasize the importance of early recognition of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. 
PUVA and cancer: a large-scale epidemiological study. There is concern about the long-term carcinogenic effects of psoralen and ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) therapy for treatment of skin disorders. A study of 4799 Swedish patients (2343 males, 2056 females; mean age at first treatment 45.3 years, range 6-93; mean follow-up 6.9 years males, 7.2 years females) who received PUVA between 1974 and 1985 showed a dose-dependent increase in the risk of squamous cell cancer of the skin. Male patients who had received more than 200 treatments had over 30 times the incidence of squamous cell cancer found in the general population. Significant increases (p less than 0.05) were also found in the incidences of respiratory cancer in males and females, pancreatic cancer in males, and kidney and colonic cancer in females. This study confirms previous reports of a dose-dependent increase in the incidence of squamous cell cancer in patients treated with PUVA. 
Protection provided by hepatitis B vaccine in a Yupik Eskimo population. Seven-year results. The long-term immunogenicity and protection provided by a plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine (Heptavax B) was determined in a cohort of susceptible persons immunized in 1981. In this study 1581 susceptible persons were immunized with the recommended three-dose regimen of hepatitis B vaccine. After 7 years, 74% of vaccinees retained antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) levels of 10 mIU/mL or more. Anti-HBs levels at 7 years varied inversely with age and directly with the level of anti-HBs attained 1 year after the first dose. During the 7 years after the first dose of vaccine, five vaccine responders and three other persons developed antibody to hepatitis B core antigen and their level of anti-HBs increased. None developed detectable hepatitis B surface antigen or clinical hepatitis. This update of an ongoing study continues to suggest that the risk of hepatitis B virus infection to most persons with an initial anti-HBs response to hepatitis B virus vaccine of 10 mIU/mL or greater is low, regardless of the initial antibody level. 
Gastric emptying after gastric interposition for cancer of the esophagus or hypopharynx. Transhiatal esophagectomy with primary anastomosis to the stomach (gastric pull-up) is an attractive surgical alternative to colic interposition in patients with cancer of the esophagus and hypopharynx. However, the lack of intrinsic gastric peristalsis and complaints by patients of postprandial regurgitation prompted us to measure the effect of body posture on the rates of gastric emptying in these patients. The rates of solid and liquid gastric emptying were measured in 14 patients who had undergone gastric interposition for esophageal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma. Rates of emptying were measured in both the supine and upright position using a dual-isotope radiolabeling technique. In these patients, the rate of gastric emptying of both solids and liquids was significantly slower in the supine position than in the upright position. Emptying in supine patients was also prolonged when compared with supine normal volunteers. Conversely, the upright rate of solid and liquid emptying in the patients was accelerated when compared with published values for upright normal volunteers. We conclude that gastric emptying after gastric interposition is dependent on upright posture after meals. 
Civilian craniocerebral gunshot wounds. Experience with 120 patients who incurred a gunshot wound to the head with dural penetration is presented. All of the patients were managed by a standard resuscitation protocol and assigned a clinical grade based on their level of consciousness both at the time of presentation and at 2 to 4 months after injury. Fifty patients (42%) underwent surgery. Twenty-eight patients (23%) had a good recovery, 19 (16%) were moderately disabled, 6 (5%) were severely disabled, and 67 (56%) died. All patients who were alert and awake with a normal or near normal neurological examination at the time of admission survived with a good outcome. All but 4 patients who were comatose at the time of admission died. Nine patients, however, who were not comatose at the time of admission died from potentially preventable causes. In 3 of these patients, a more aggressive diagnostic approach (including cerebral angiography) may have altered their ultimate outcome. An expeditious approach to the trauma victim with a comprehensive management scheme after injury may have altered the course in the remainder of these patients. 
Surgical implications of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis. Four cases are described of acute non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis with subsequent development of a compartmental syndrome, requiring extensive fasciotomies. All the patients were young male alcoholics who were taking benzodiazepines as part of an addiction treatment programme. In this risk group clinicians should be aware of two serious complications of non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis: acute renal failure and compartmental syndrome. 
Prolonged hypofibrinogenemia and protein C activation after envenoming by Echis carinatus sochureki. Following envenomization by Echis carinatus sochureki, a professional snake handler developed a profound coagulopathy manifested by hemorrhage from the bite site, venipuncture sites and gums; coagulation testing revealed prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times greater than 150 seconds, a fibrinogen of 0 mg%, and marked elevation of fibrin degradation products. In addition, protein C antigen levels were undetectable. The coagulopathy was treated with cryoprecipitate; two different antivenoms were also administered with uncertain benefit. Subsequently, the properties of the venom and antivenoms were studied. Venom did not directly clot fibrinogen; however, venom concentrations as low as 0.2 micrograms/ml caused significant prothrombin activation. In addition, venom activated protein C in the absence of thrombomodulin, and this activity was inhibited by hirudin. The ability of four commercial antivenoms to neutralize the venom prothrombinase and hemorrhagic activity was measured. Three of the four antivenoms partially neutralized venom-induced prothrombin activation. Extreme differences in efficacy were found among the four antivenoms in neutralizing venom hemorrhagic activity in mice. This case illustrates the difficulty in managing the complex coagulopathy that can result from exotic snake envenomization, and identifies a new coagulant property of Echis carinatus venom (protein C activation). 
Abnormal diastolic left ventricular filling by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. To determine characteristics of diastolic left ventricular (LV) function in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), two groups of CAPD patients without (n = 23; group 1) vs with (n = 25; group 2) LV hypertrophy (greater than 13 mm) were compared with a group of untreated non-renal hypertensive patients with LV hypertrophy (n = 11; group 3) using Doppler-echocardiography. Age and body surface area were comparable in all three groups, mean CAPD-duration (32 +/- 28 vs 26 +/- 23 months; p = NS) was comparable in renal patients. LV systolic function in echocardiography (LVEF: 62 vs 64 vs 63%) and systolic time intervals were normal and comparable in all three groups. Atrial maximum filling velocities (96 +/- 25 vs 91 +/- 25 vs 67 +/- 8 cm/s) were comparably increased, the ratio of maximal early/atrial filling velocities was comparably decreased (0.73 +/- 0.25 vs 0.77 +/- 0.21 vs 0.99 +/- 0.05) in both groups of renal patients as compared to group 3 (p less than 0.05-0.01). Atrial filling fractions were increased in all three groups, more pronounced in group 1 than in group 3 (50 +/- 11 vs 40 +/- 7%; p less than 0.05). The normal correlation of Doppler parameters with age and with LV radius/thickness ratio was altered in renal patients such that high patient age tended to have an additional negative influence on LV diastolic function of hypertrophied, but not of normal myocardium. Isovolumic relaxation time was prolonged in all three groups (134 +/- 38 vs 131 +/- 34 vs 116 +/- 17 ms; p = NS). We conclude that in patients on CAPD, diastolic LV filling is impaired both in normal and hypertrophied myocardium. High age is a factor that further attributes to diastolic dysfunction of hypertrophied myocardium in CAPD. 
Treatable blindness in temporal arteritis. Temporal arteritis is a common cause of blindness. Prompt steroid treatment limits unilateral visual loss while protecting the contralateral eye. Established blindness is irreversible. We report a case of temporal arteritis in which an eye with no light perception secondary to an arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy regained 6/6 vision. 
A randomized study of on-line plasma perfusion over protein A-sepharose and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma. To evaluate the safety of on-line plasma perfusion over protein-A sepharose and the therapeutic advantage of combining plasma perfusion (PP) over protein-A sepharose with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma (MCRC), thirty patients were randomized after surgery of primary CRC to receive a combination of 5-FU and PP over protein-A sepharose (group A), or a combination of 5-FU and PP over sepharose (group B), or 5-FU alone (group C). Bi-weekly on-line PP over 200 ml protein-A sepharose gel (group A) or 200 ml sepharose gel (group B) were performed with a Cobe 2997 blood cell separator for a maximum of 19 treatments per patient. 5-FU was given at 1000 mg/m2/d on days 1-5 of a 4-weekly cycle until progression. PP was well tolerated and no severe or life-threatening toxicity was observed. Mild clinical side-effects consisted of fever and chills (36% in group A, 23% in group B). The most common biological effects of PP over protein-A sepharose were significant drops in IgG (66% of pre-PP values), CH50 and C3 (73% of pre-PP values) and a significant generation of C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins. Tumor response rates were 40% for group A, 0% for group B and 20% for group C. The median survival times tended to be longer in group A (17 months) than in group B (10 months) and in group C (9 months). This is the first randomized trial showing some therapeutic advantage in combining PP over protein-A sepharose with conventional chemotherapy in MCRC. 
Primary spinal epidural extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma. The case of a 7-year-old boy with a spinal epidural extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EES) is presented. He is in complete remission without neurologic deficit 40 months after diagnosis. Another 15 cases were found in the literature and are discussed together with this patient. Twelve of them were male patients. The mean age of the patients was 17.5 years (range, 4 to 47). Symptoms included back pain and/or radicular pain (100%), paresis of one or both legs (83%), sensory disturbances, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. The mean diagnostic delay was 5.8 months. Each patient underwent laminectomy; complete resection of the tumor was impossible in more than 50% of the cases. Most patients received radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. Four patients suffered from local recurrence, eight from metastases. Ten (63%) patients died, 1 to 48 months (mean, 16) after diagnosis. The differential diagnosis is discussed, including disk herniation and several benign and malignant tumors. 
A 2-year experience with the Wolf piezoelectric lithotripter: impact of repeat treatment on results and complications. During a 2-year period, 884 extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy treatments have been performed on stones in 388 renal units (kidney and upper ureter) using a Wolf Piezolith device.* Lithotripsy routinely was performed on an outpatient basis without use of anesthesia or premedication. Often, the maximum number of pulses allowable by a Food and Drug Administration protocol (4,000) was delivered and retreatments frequently occurred on successive days. Of the patients 75% were stone-free 3 months after treatment, while another 20% had only residual small fragments. No intrarenal or perinephric hematomas were observed and only 1 patient has had hypertension requiring medication. Renal colic from passage of stone fragments occurred in only 10% of the patients. An aggressive treatment policy using repeat treatments as necessary provides for superior results with this device without an incision or complication. 
Interference between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep in near miss SIDS. GER may be considered as one of the triggering factors in some apparently life-threatening events or even SIDS. Also at the present time, many teams perform 24-h pH monitoring in at-risk infants and treat those with abnormal scores. However, further investigations are needed to answer the question: Which unknown additional factor(s) is present when a specific episode of GER causes apnea and/or bradycardia either during sleep or wakefulness?. 
Amnesia following damage to the left fornix and to other sites. A comparative study. Two memory-impaired patients, who had suffered damage to the left or both fornix columns during removal of a ventricular cyst, were compared with 3 others having left-sided hippocampal or thalamic lesions, and with normal controls. The tests used were nonverbal--scene recognition, delayed matching-to-sample and concurrent pattern and object discrimination learning. The last two are differentially sensitive to fornix transection and to hippocampal or thalamic ablations in monkeys; however, the patients with fornix damage did not show a distinctive pattern of impairment. The reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. The study adds to the evidence that fornix transection can cause wide-ranging memory disturbances in man. 
Preoperative hemostatic assessment of the adenotonsillectomy patient. Intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage in the patient who has undergone an adenotonsillectomy because of an unrecognized hemostatic defect may increase morbidity and can be potentially life-threatening to the patient in what should be a "routine" procedure. Preoperative identification of occult hemostatic abnormalities, coupled with perioperative management directed at correcting the effects of the defects, should serve to reduce the incidence of this distressful complication. Routine use of preoperative laboratory screening tests for this purpose has been discouraged recently as a result of concerns over cost-effectiveness and the low predictiveness of the tests for bleeding. Our experience with the routine use of a comprehensive hemostatic laboratory screening panel--which includes a bleeding time test--in the adenotonsillectomy patient population demonstrated that 11.5% of our patients had abnormal initial screening laboratory tests; these results were ultimately attributable to occult hemostatic defects. Clinical history, the universally recommended method of preoperative hemostatic assessment, failed to detect any previously unrecognized coagulation disorder. Laboratory screening improved preoperative detection of occult hemostatic defects and allowed for appropriate alterations in perioperative care. Our results with this approach are presented, along with illustrative case histories and a discussion of the current recommendations for preoperative laboratory screening of the hemostatic system, as found in a review of the literature. 
The influence of intraoperative hypotension and perioperative blood transfusion on disease-free survival in patients with complete resection of colorectal liver metastases. An increased interest in surgical treatment of liver metastases from colorectal origin has evolved recently. However not all patients benefit from this approach, with early recurrence and death still being encountered. To evaluate clinical as well as perioperative factors that might significantly affect the outcome of patients with completely resected colorectal liver metastases, we examined 116 patients who underwent resection between September 1987 and August 1989. Median follow-up time was 13.2 months (0.6 to 31.4 months). The overall survival rate was 91% at 1 year and 75% at 2 years. Median survival was not reached. Median disease-free survival time was 11.5 months, with 49.4% and 21.2% of the patients being free of disease at 1 and 2 years, respectively. By univariate analysis, site of primary colorectal cancer, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, size of metastases, number of metastases, length of operation time, percentage mean arterial pressure, number of hypotensive episodes, duration of hypotensive episodes, and whole blood transfusion significantly affected recurrence rate following resection. However only site of primary tumor, CEA, number of metastases, and number of hypotensive episodes remained significant in the multivariate analysis. The most significant single factor that affected recurrence rate was the number of hypotensive episodes during the operative procedure. It is concluded that hypotensive episodes, even when well controlled, should be avoided during operation to maximize the chances of cure and prolong disease-free survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases. 
A survey of antiemetic use in children with cancer. Pediatric oncologists within Pediatric Oncology Group institutions were surveyed to determine current antiemetic practices for children receiving chemotherapy and the basis for those practices. A mean severity rating for associated nausea and vomiting was calculated and used to rank 31 chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in the treatment of childhood cancer. Antiemetics were used 17%, 79%, and 98% of the time for chemotherapeutic agents with mild, moderate, or severe associated nausea and vomiting, respectively. A median of one, two, and three antiemetics were used for mild, moderate, and severe agents, respectively. Antihistamines and phenothiazines were the drugs most commonly used for agents causing mild or moderate nausea and vomiting, and metoclopramide hydrochloride/antihistamines with lorazepam and/or corticosteroids were used most often for chemotherapeutic agents causing severe nausea and vomiting. Most oncologists based their choice of antiemetics on personal experience. Current literature addressing the treatment of nausea and vomiting in children receiving chemotherapy, as reviewed here, does not always support the present clinical practices. 
Comparison of celiprolol and propranolol in stable angina pectoris. Celiprolol International Angina Study Group. The comparative antianginal effects and safety of propranolol and celiprolol, a highly beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker with selective partial beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist activity, were assessed in an international multicenter, placebo run-in, active control, double-blind, randomized, titration-to-effect study of 140 patients with stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris. At baseline, all patients received placebo for 2 weeks, then titrated doses of once-daily celiprolol (200, 400, 600 mg) or twice-daily propranolol (total daily dose 80, 160, 320 mg) over 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week maintenance period. Heart rate and blood pressure, at rest and with exercise, weekly anginal attack frequency, nitroglycerin consumption and symptom-limited treadmill exercise times (modified Bruce protocol) were assessed. Compared with their respective baselines, both celiprolol and propranolol reduced anginal attack and nitroglycerin consumption rates to a comparable degree, while improving exercise tolerance (p less than 0.05). Treatment with propranolol compared with celiprolol, however, was associated with a significantly lower heart rate at rest (p less than 0.01). The double-product at the conclusion of exercise testing was significantly reduced by both drugs. Celiprolol and propranolol had similar effects on blood pressure, and were well tolerated. More symptomatic bradycardia occurred with propranolol. Despite the differences in their hemodynamic actions, once-daily celiprolol is as effective as twice-daily propranolol in the treatment of patients with stable angina pectoris. 
Exclusion of cervical spine injury: a prospective study. Trauma room lateral cervical spine radiographs (LCSR) may improve the safety of intubation and transportation of multiply injured patients by providing earlier recognition of spinal vertebral injuries. We prospectively evaluated 60 consecutive trauma admissions to determine the impact of clearance of cervical spine radiographs on patient care. Fifty-three patients had no cervical spine injury (CSI). Intubations, emergency head CT scan, aortography, or urgent operation (less than 6 hours after admission) were required in the majority of patients and preceded complete cervical spine clearance in all but one instance. The median time for radiologic clearance of the cervical spine was 15 hours (range, 1.5 to 181). LCSR failed to identify three of the seven acute CSI (all three had C7 fractures). The spine-injured were managed with cervical collars and no new neurologic injury developed. We conclude that: 1) LCSRs do not appear to alter urgent management of multiply injured patients during resuscitation and transportation; 2) chest radiographs and emergency investigations should not be delayed by repeated LCSR in the trauma room as it may be difficult to fully exclude CSI in many trauma patients; 3) we support the current ATLS guidelines, which suggest that all patients should be presumed to have an unstable CSI until the presence of cervical injury has been excluded. 
Access to health care in the United States: barriers for neurologic patients, challenges for neurologic physicians Approximately 34 million people in the United States have no health insurance. Up to 80 million people have insurance inadequate to provide care for severe or long-term illness (the underinsured). In 1986, an estimated 1 million persons in the US could not obtain needed health care for financial reasons, and another 18.8 million had difficulty obtaining care. There probably are 3.2 million people with neurologic disorders among the 34 million uninsured, and more among the underinsured. Those patients probably have difficulty obtaining health care, including neurologic consultations, laboratory tests, and radiologic procedures. Congress and many state legislatures are considering various proposals to address the problems of the un- and underinsured. Several national medical professional societies have developed programs to improve access to care for their patients. The American Academy of Neurology Task Force on Access to Health Care is studying access to care for neurologic patients and will recommend a course of action to the Academy. The Task Force welcomes suggestions concerning appropriate steps to improve access to health care for patients with neurologic disorders. 
Survivorship analysis of the uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee replacement [published erratum appears in J Bone Joint Surg [Am] 1991 Sep;73(8):1274] Ninety-six patients who had a total of 108 replacements with an uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee prosthesis were followed for an average of sixty-four months (range, thirty-nine to ninety-three months). At the time of the most recent follow-up, twenty-one implants (19 per cent) had failed, all due to problems with the tibial component. A patellar component was not used, and no noteworthy patellar problems were encountered after the operation. There were no infections about the prostheses, and no femoral implant was revised. The most common cause of failure was collapse of the anteromedial part of the tibial plateau, which occurred in fourteen knees. The prosthesis loosened without collapse of bone in two knees, and five knees were revised because of gross wear of the polyethylene. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which revision of the prosthesis was recommended, the cumulative rate of survival was 84 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, +/- 7 per cent) at five years and 77 +/- 10 per cent at six years. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which the knee replacement was actually done, the five-year rate of survival was the same. No significant differences were demonstrated between groups that were stratified by age, sex, weight, or primary diagnosis. We therefore do not recommend the use of an uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee replacement of the design that was evaluated in this study. 
Incidence and timing of hypothermia in trauma patients undergoing operations. Hypothermia is a major problem in patients who have sustained trauma. We reviewed the cases of 100 consecutive trauma patients transferred directly to the operating room (OR) from the Emergency Department (ED) in a Level I trauma center; 26 cases could not be evaluated. Forty-two patients (57%) became hypothermic at some time between injury and leaving the OR. Fifty-five patients (74%) had a temperature (T) recorded on arrival to the ED; but only 7 (12%) were hypothermic (34.7 degrees +/- 1.5 degrees C). In contrast, 34 patients (46%) arrived in the OR hypothermic (34.8 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees C) and 26 (76%) of these left the OR hypothermic (34.8 degrees +/- 0.9 degrees C). Eight additional patients (20%) arriving in the OR with a T greater than 35.9 degrees C left the OR hypothermic (35.1 degrees +/- 0.4 degrees C). The mean T loss in the ED was significantly greater than that lost in the OR (-0.8 degrees +/- 0.7 degrees C vs. 0.0 degrees +/- 0.6 degrees C; p less than 0.0001, ANOVA). Ninety-two percent of the patients lost temperature in the ED, while 43% of the patients gained temperature in the OR. Hypothermia was associated with lower Trauma Scores, and those patients who were severely hypothermic received more intravenous fluids. However, the impact of fluid infusion was not independent from Trauma Score and did not fully explain the magnitude of the heat loss. These data suggest that hypothermia in trauma patients has a multifactoral etiology related to the magnitude of injury and that the major T loss occurs in the ED rather than in the OR. 
Microinfarction in classic migraine? A study with magnetic resonance imaging findings. By means of magnetic resonance imaging we investigated a total of 45 patients suffering from classic migraine; 25 patients had been treated in our department for classic migraine over the past 2 years (group A), and 20 other patients investigated between 1976 and 1984 were reexamined for this study (group B). Thirty-two age- and roughly sex-matched healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging and served as controls (group C). There was a trend for patients with classic migraine to have more subcortical patchy lesions on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. In a comparison of our control subjects and patients with a history of greater than 20 attacks of classic migraine taken from groups A and B, this difference in number of lesions was significant (p = 0.02). The results suggest that patchy lesions in patients with classic migraine should be interpreted with particular caution before diagnosing a demyelinating disease since the lesions could be ischemic in origin. 
Medication-induced esophageal injury: report of 17 cases with endoscopic documentation. We report on medication-induced esophageal injury (MIEI) in 17 patients (six male, 11 female) seen from October 1986 to May 1990. The mean age of patients was 27.3 (SD = 5.7) yr; mean duration of drug ingestion prior to the occurrence of symptoms 10.2 (SD = 11.5) days, and mean duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention 4.6 (SD = 3.8) days. Symptoms subsided after treatment, with a mean of 6 (SD = 2.5) days. Symptoms included odynophagia (in 17), chest pain (six), epigastric pain (three), and retrosternal pain (one). Symptoms occurred after the drug was stopped in three. MIEI was caused by doxycycline (seven), minocycline (five), Pantozyme (one), cloxacillin (one), unknown (two), and dicloxacillin + Danzen (one). Reclining after drug ingestion was the predominant risk factor. Endoscopy showed most ulcers to be multiple and at midesophagus. Barium swallows done in two patients were negative. There is no previous report of Pantozyme (pancreatic enzyme), Danzen (serratio-peptidase), cloxacillin, and dicloxacillin causing MIEI. 
Incidental appendectomy during videolaseroscopy. One hundred incidental appendectomies were performed in patients undergoing operative laparoscopy (videolaseroscopy) for evaluating and treating various major diseases of the reproductive organs. Except for a fever resolving within 24 hours in one case and mild periumbilical ecchymosis, there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. All patients were discharged within 24 hours of surgery. Average hospital stay was 14 hours. All cases have been followed up for a minimum of 8 months. We believe any risk associated with elective appendectomy as reported here is minimal and outweighed by the benefits of eliminating future emergency appendectomy, simplifying future differential diagnosis of pelvic pain and removing unsuspected abnormality found in the appendix. 
Pancytopenia secondary to short-term, high-dose intravenous infusion of amrinone. The incidence of amrinone-induced thrombocytopenia has been reported to be 2.4 percent in patients receiving intravenous therapy. To date there have been no reports of bleeding in these patients nor have there been reports of other hematologic abnormalities secondary to amrinone administration. This case report describes a patient whose hematologic values began to decrease after two days of amrinone therapy, reaching a nadir at day 8. Values returned to baseline eight days after treatment was discontinued. This report provides the first evidence that amrinone may induce pancytopenia in patients who receive short courses of high-dose, continuous-infusion amrinone. 
3DFT MR angiography of the carotid bifurcation: potential and limitations as a screening examination. The authors compared the three-dimensional Fourier transform (3DFT) time-of-flight magnetic resonance (MR) angiograms in 38 patients initially studied with selective intraarterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) for suspected arteriosclerotic disease of the carotid bifurcation. MR angiograms were successfully obtained in 65 of the 75 carotid arteries (87%) visualized with DSA. DSA and MR angiographic studies were assessed for percentage area stenosis by two independent observers on two occasions. Statistical tests indicated consistency in interpretation for each observer as well as between observers. No significant difference was found between the two modalities in ability to depict changes in percentage area stenosis. For the 32 right carotid arteries in the comparison, the median for the difference between MR angiography and intraarterial DSA was 1.83% (range, -22.38% to 55.60%); for the 33 visualized left carotid arteries, it was 0.00% (range, -20.55% to 49.95%). Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that technically adequate MR angiography may be a sensitive screening examination for stenoses. 
Hepatic phosphofructokinase-1 activity and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels in patients with abdominal sepsis. 1. In sepsis various processes of carbohydrate metabolism, such as hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycolysis, are altered. Phosphofructokinase-1, a key glycolytic enzyme, is controlled in the long term via regulation of synthesis and degradation of the protein itself, while in the short term it is regulated by allosteric effectors, such as fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (the most potent). In the present study hepatic phosphofructokinase-1 activity as well as phosphofructokinase-2 activity and the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate were assayed to determine if they might contribute to the derangement of carbohydrate metabolism seen commonly in sepsis. 2. The levels of glycogen and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and the activity of phosphofructokinase-1 and phosphofructokinase-2 were determined in hepatic biopsies obtained at laparotomy from six patients with and seven patients without abdominal septic foci. 3. A significant increase in plasma lactate concentration was observed in the septic patients, whereas no significant differences in tissue glycogen content or plasma glucose concentration were seen between the groups. 4. No significant change in plasma insulin concentration was observed. However, levels of the counter-regulatory hormones (glucagon, cortisol and adrenaline) were elevated in the septic patients. 5. A 60% decrease in hepatic phosphofructokinase-1 activity was seen in the septic patients. However, no significant changes in hepatic phosphofructokinase-2 activity and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate content were observed in the septic patients. 6. The present results demonstrate that the decrease in hepatic phosphofructokinase-1 activity occurring in sepsis does not appear to reflect alterations in the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate. 
Abdominal musculature abnormalities as a cause of groin pain in athletes. Inguinal hernias and pubalgia. There has been increasing interest within the European sports medicine community regarding the etiology and treatment of groin pain in the athlete. Groin pain is most commonly caused by musculotendinous strains of the adductors and other muscles crossing the hip joint, but may also be related to abdominal wall abnormalities. Cases may be termed "pubalgia" if physical examination does not reveal inguinal hernia and there is an absence of other etiology for groin pain. We present nine cases of patients who underwent herniorrhaphies for groin pain. Two patients had groin pain without evidence of a hernia preoperatively (pubalgia). In the remaining seven patients we determined the presence of a hernia by physical examination. At operation, eight patients were found to have inguinal hernias. One patient had no hernia but had partial avulsion of the internal oblique fibers from their insertion at the public tubercle. The average interval from operation to return to full activity was 11 weeks. All patients returned to full activity within 3 months of surgery. One patient had persistent symptoms of mild incisional tenderness, but otherwise there were no recurrences, complications, or persistence of symptoms. Abnormalities of the abdominal wall, including inguinal hernias and microscopic tears or avulsions of the internal oblique muscle, can be an overlooked source of groin pain in the athlete. Operative treatment of this condition with herniorrhaphy can return the athlete to his sport within 3 months. 
Correlates of Beck Depression Inventory scores in an ambulatory elderly population: symptoms, diseases, laboratory values, and medications. BACKGROUND. Depression is one of the most important psychiatric disorders of older people. Between 1% and 5% of elderly persons who live in the community have major depression. Depressed elderly people are thought to be more likely to complain of symptoms such as headache, constipation, and pain than of disordered mood. The purpose of this study was to determine whether certain symptoms, diseases, or drugs used by older people correlate with scores on the Beck Depression Inventory. METHODS. Beck Depression Inventory scores were obtained in an ambulatory elderly population to identify correlates with self-reported signs, symptoms, diseases, drugs, and laboratory values. A total of 1048 participants were studied, including 712 women and 336 men. RESULTS. In this study, 13.7% of the men and 20.7% of the women had scores suggesting possible depression. A linear regression model revealed eight factors of significance in predicting scores on the Beck Depression Inventory. The most important predictors were the total number of symptoms reported by the patient (P less than .0001), and subjective complaints of memory loss (P less than .0003) and of pain in the abdomen (P less than .0004). CONCLUSIONS. Clinically, the results of this study suggest that depression is underdiagnosed in older patients and that multiple somatic symptoms are the best indicator of depression in this population. 
Meningioangiomatosis: clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic correlation. Meningioangiomatosis (MA) is a rare, benign, hamartomatous lesion of the leptomeninges; MA has been considered to be a forme fruste of neurofibromatosis. A review of pathology records for patients with MA who were seen between 1970 and 1989 at the authors' institutions revealed four patients (three male and one female; aged 2.5-21.0 years; mean, 10.8 years) with a history of seizures but without the stigmata or family history of neurofibromatosis. Three patients had undergone either computed tomographic (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies. All patients had undergone craniotomies to obtain tissue for pathologic analysis; a peripheral, leptomeningeal lesion was found in all four patients. At CT in two patients, the lesions were most consistent with calcification. At T2-weighted MR imaging in one patient, the lesion demonstrated a hyperintense periphery with associated edema of the white matter. Histopathologic examination demonstrated characteristic features of MA--cortical meningovascular fibroblastic proliferation and leptomeningeal calcification. The accurate diagnosis of MA is important since MA is a benign, surgically correctable cause of seizures. 
Cauda equina compression associated with breast cancer. A case study in differential diagnosis. The determination of the etiology of spinal cord compression in cancer patients is essential for appropriate therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are not immune to the development of superimposed nonmalignant disease. Although metastatic epidural compression may occur in up to 9% of breast cancer patients, care must be taken to rule out other nonmetastatic lesions causing compression. The association of concurrent breast carcinoma and a spinal neurilemoma simulating a metastatic lesion seems not to have been previously reported. A neurilemoma was observed in a 50-year-old woman. A neurilemoma suspected to be a metastatic lesion may produce the clinical features of pain, neurologic deficit, and weakness. Differentiation will be aided by roentgenograms, radionuclide bone scans, computed tomography, and possible magnetic resonance imaging. Radiologic differentiation hinges on the recognition and the slow-growing nature and noninvasive boundaries of the nonmalignant lesion. Ultimate verification is by biopsy. Treatment should consist of neurectomy, if severely symptomatic, and stabilization as indicated. 
The child with spells. The purpose of this article was to discuss paroxysms, both neurologic and non-neurologic, that can mimic seizures. This is summarized in Table 4. It should be clear that the evaluation of any spell in a child should begin with a detailed and complete history. Historical features should focus on all aspects of the event--length of time, situation, appearance, quantity, as well as other features not directly pertaining to the event. Physical and neurologic examinations are frequently normal. Ancillary testing that may prove valuable include routine and video EEG monitoring as well as home video recording. 
Adenosine for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Adenosine is the most recent drug approved for the treatment of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. Its advantage is that it is just as effective as verapamil and is far less toxic. The lack of toxicity is due to the extremely short half-life (one to seven seconds). The mechanism of action of adenosine is different from that of other antiarrhythmic agents. For the specific purpose of ameliorating paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, adenosine appears to be an ideal antiarrhythmic drug. 
Recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis after renal transplantation. In a young adult male with chronic renal failure from focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, massive proteinuria appeared within two weeks after transplantation. Although allograft biopsy at eight weeks was normal, a second biopsy eight months after transplant showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis again. Sixteen months after transplantation maintenance hemodialysis had to be restarted. 
A comparative trial of the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids. Outcome in 3- to 8-month-old infants, 9- to 23-month-old infants and children, and 24- to 30-month-old children. The reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the Takeda acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids were compared in 139 infants aged 3 to 8 months, 60 infants and children aged 9 to 23 months, and 99 children aged 24 to 30 months. Good antibody responses to pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), and agglutinogens occurred in all age groups after both the third and fourth doses. After the fourth (booster) dose, the mean antibody values in initially seronegative infants vaccinated at 3 to 8 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 67.8 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (EU) per milliliter; anti-FHA, 149.5 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 125.6. The values in initially seronegative children vaccinated at 24 to 30 months of age were as follows: anti-PT, 92.9 EU/mL; anti-FHA, 251.7 EU/mL; the agglutinin titer was 275.8. Reactions following immunization were minimal. Except for drowsiness after the first dose in infants, there were no clinically significant differences in reactions between infants and older children. The findings in this study coupled with the recent demonstration of efficacy of this vaccine in 2-year-old children supports the recent Japanese recommendation to lower the age of immunization with acellular pertussis vaccine combined with tetanus and diphtheria toxoids to 3 months. 
Detection of tissue injury after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy of gallstones. We evaluated seven patients undergoing gallstone lithotripsy for evidence of hepatic or renal trauma after each of 10 lithotripsy treatments. Postlithotripsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sonography showed no evidence of hepatic or renal injury as compared with baseline studies. Four treatments resulted in sonographic evidence of gaseous hepatic microbubbles (analogous to "the bends") due to cavitation effects of the shockwaves. Three of these four treatments produced serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase and -pyruvic transaminase elevation. One patient had microscopic hematuria. Minimal tissue damage results from gallstone lithotripsy. MRI and ultrasound, performed after lithotripsy, appear to be less sensitive than transaminasemia in detecting this low-grade injury. 
Metastatic pattern of infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast: an autopsy study. We analyzed the autopsy records and autopsy histological slides of 261 patients with breast carcinoma who died at the Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, from January 1972 to October 1989, with particular attention to the metastatic pattern of infiltrating lobular carcinoma (ILC) which we compared with infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC). In 226 of 261 patients who died with metastatic disease there were 25 cases of ILC, 195 cases of IDC, 4 cases of mixed IDC-ILC, and 2 cases of mucinous carcinoma. There was no statistically significant difference in frequency of metastases to common metastatic sites, such as the liver, bone, and pleura, with the exception of the lungs, in which IDC metastases prevailed (P less than 0.006). By contrast, a statistically highly significant prevalence of ILC metastases to the peritoneum/retroperitoneum, hollow viscera, internal genital organs, leptomeninges, and myocardium was found (P values of less than 0.006- less than 10(-6). The metastases to these sites were characterized by diffuse growth of neoplastic cells that infiltrated in a lymphoma or leukemia-like fashion. Such metastases may remain clinically silent for a long time, in spite of their extensiveness. The difference of metastatic pattern between ILC and IDC is insufficiently appreciated in most of the published studies on ILC. 
Excessive sweating: an uncommon sign of basilar artery occlusion. Excessive sweating of the face and, to a lesser degree, of the thorax and limbs, occurred after basilar artery occlusion in a 15 year old Saudi boy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a limited bilateral paramedian infarction of the rostral ventral pons. Basilar artery occlusion in children and adolescents is a rarity. Excessive sweating following such a stroke is rare in any age group. Clinico-anatomical correlations are discussed. 
A comparative study of the cerebrovascular complications of cocaine: alkaloidal versus hydrochloride--a review. Cocaine, especially in its alkaloidal or "crack" form, has been increasingly associated with cerebrovascular disease. Before the crack epidemic, cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) was also implicated as a cause of stroke. However, less is known about the differences in stroke subtypes, age at stroke onset, or presence of underlying structural cerebrovascular disease with different forms of cocaine use. We compared 26 patients (previously reported) from our four institutions plus 16 cases reported in the literature of stroke associated with alkaloidal cocaine to 63 (57 reported in the literature and six not previously reported from our four institutions) cases of stroke associated with cocaine HCl. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are equally likely after alkaloidal cocaine use, whereas cocaine HCl is more likely (approximately 80% of the time) to cause hemorrhagic stroke, with approximately half the intracranial hemorrhages occurring from ruptured cerebral saccular aneurysms or vascular malformations. The presence of an underlying cerebral aneurysm was more common among patients with cocaine HCl-associated strokes than alkaloidal cocaine-associated strokes. Cerebral infarction was significantly more common among the alkaloidal cocaine users than in all the cocaine HCl users, and this was also true when alkaloidal cocaine users were compared with parenteral cocaine HCl (intravenous and intramuscular) users. Only hemorrhagic stroke has been reported with intravenous cocaine HCl use. We conclude that the pathogenesis of cocaine-related stroke is heterogeneous, and depends, in part, on the form of cocaine used. 
Cerebrovascular complications after orthotopic liver transplantation: a clinicopathologic study. We analyzed 55 autopsy cases in 1,357 patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation at the University of Pittsburgh and found that 13 (23.6%) patients had intracranial bleeding, and five (9%) had infarcts. Eight patients had bleeding localized to one intracranial compartment: intracerebral hemorrhage (three patients); subarachnoid hemorrhage (three patients); and subdural hematoma (two patients). Five patients had combinations of multiple sites of bleeding: three with subarachnoid hemorrhage-intracerebral hemorrhage, one with subarachnoid hemorrhage-intracerebral hemorrhage-subdural hematoma, and one with subdural hematoma-intracerebral hemorrhage. Coexistent CNS infections (fungal or bacterial) were associated with hemorrhagic infarcts and intracerebral hemorrhage in four patients. Cerebral embolism and hemorrhagic infarction from bacterial endocarditis occurred in one patient. Five patients died of intracranial bleeding. Severe coagulopathy was the major cause of intracranial bleeding and was associated with systemic bleeding in 12 patients. Significant systemic or metabolic complications were present in all patients and masked the focal signs of the intracranial process in more than one half. 
Digestion of bovine milk proteins in patients with a high jejunostomy. Digestion of milk proteins was studied in short-bowel patients. After ingestion of water, purified beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Ig), or skim milk, effluents were collected at the stoma. The flow rate of the effluent peaked in the first 30-min period after ingestion and returned to the basal value within the first 60 min. After milk ingestion 1) the nitrogen concentration of effluents peaked in the first 30 min, 2) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot indicated the presence of beta-Ig and alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-lac) in jejunal effluents but only during the first 30 min whereas caseins were detected during the initial 1-2 h effluents, and 3) immunoenzymo metric assay indicated that 64% and 44% of the beta-Ig and alpha-lac, respectively, were recovered in an intact antigenic form. Results indicate that the digestion of milk proteins in humans differs quantitatively. Digestion appeared partially incomplete in the upper jejunum, suggesting the importance of the ileum for completion of digestion. 
Some genetic aspects of rolandic epilepsy: waking and sleep EEGs in siblings. Epileptic activity was recorded electroencephalographically in at least one sibling in 22 (51.16%) of 43 patients with rolandic epilepsy and/or centrotemporal spikes. In 26 of 69 (37.68%) siblings, epileptic discharges were observed. These were recorded only in waking in 1 subject (1.5%), in waking and sleep in 13 (18.8%), and in sleep only in 12 (17.4%). The greatest number of epileptic discharges was noted in waking during hyperventilation (52.4%) and in sleep stage C (88%). Foci were recorded in only 4 (5.8%) of the 26 cases with epileptic discharges, and generalized spike-wave complexes were recorded in 22 (31.9%). In one sibling, the sharp-wave focus was located in the right centrotemporal area, in a second in the left occipital, and in a third in the left frontal region with spreading to the centrotemporal; in the fourth, two independent foci were observed in the left and right centrotemporal area. One epileptic discharge was observed every 74.9 s in waking and every 150.9 s in sleep. Epileptic activity was greatest in the group between 5 and 12 years of age (54.3%). The same activation rates were noted in siblings of patients with (47.2%) and without seizures (42.9%), and no differences were noted in siblings with (40%) or without (37.5%) seizures. Family history and sex of the siblings of patient did not play a role in the rate of activation. An autosomal dominant inheritance is assumed, but further investigations are necessary. 
IgM-associated primary diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis: natural history and prognostic indicators. Fifty-four adults with primary mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and IgM deposition were observed for a minimum of three years or until end-stage renal failure. The actuarial renal survival was 80 per cent at 5 years and 64 per cent at 10 years; multivariate analysis identified microscopic haematuria, extent of mesangial proliferation and global glomerular sclerosis as independent prognostic indicators. 
Immunohistochemical demonstration of neurone specific enolase in bone marrow infiltrated by neuroblastoma. One hundred and two bone marrow samples were analysed by histological and immunohistochemical methods for neurone specific enolase (NSE). The biopsies were performed to determine the extent of bone marrow disease in 84 neuroblastomas, nine embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, five Ewing's sarcomas, two cases of Hodgkin's disease and two lymphoblastic lymphomas. Twenty seven (32%) of neuroblastoma bone marrows showed metastases by conventional histological techniques and 33 (39%) after immunohistochemical staining with NSE. Five embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, five Ewing's sarcomas, and two lymphoblastic lymphomas showed bone marrow metastases. Only one of these cases was reactive for NSE. NSE represents a very sensitive immunomarker for the follow up of neuroblastoma and improves detection of bone marrow invasion by neuroblastoma. 
Rheumatoid iliopsoas bursitis presenting as unilateral femoral nerve palsy. A 65-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) developed symptomatic compression of the femoral nerve secondary to an iliopsoas bursitis. Her adjacent hip joint was not severely affected by arthritis. This entity should be included among the entrapment neuropathies complicating RA. 
Clinical aspects of pelvic inflammatory disease. Pelvic inflammatory disease is caused by spread of organisms from the vagina and cervix to the upper genital tract. The patient may have a life-threatening illness or may remain asymptomatic. The disease may be caused by sexually or nonsexually transmitted organisms. Polymicrobial infections are the rule. Therapy requires antibiotic agents with broad coverage of aerobic and anaerobic organisms, including Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
