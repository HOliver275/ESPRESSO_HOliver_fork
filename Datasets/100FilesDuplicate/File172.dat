Combined thoracic aortic dissection and abdominal aortic fusiform aneurysm. Certain clinical and autopsy findings are described in 13 patients who had both aortic dissection (AD) and fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). All 13 patients had severe and extensive aortic atherosclerosis. The AAA was diagnosed clinically in 9 patients, and 5 had the AAA resected. The AD was diagnosed clinically in 5 patients, and 2 underwent attempted operative repair. Two patients who had the AAA resected because of suspected rupture were found later to have ruptured a more proximal AD. Thus, AD occurs occasionally in patients who have AAA. In older persons with suspected rupture of an AAA, a more proximal rupture of an AD should be ruled out. When both AAA and AD are present in the same patient, the AD is more likely the cause of cardiovascular collapse than is rupture of the AAA. 
Enterocutaneous fistulas following laparotomy for trauma. Enterocutaneous fistulas (ECF) are recognized complications of various bowel diseases. Trauma is reported as a rare cause of ECF. ECF following laparotomy for abdominal injury was studied in 15 patients to determine whether traditional principles of management for ECF are applicable in posttraumatic ECF. Thirty-three per cent of patients with posttraumatic ECF spontaneously healed fistulas with appropriate nutritional support without operative intervention. Sixty-six per cent of patients required operative intervention, either because of associated sepsis or failure to spontaneously heal. Five patients had fistulas originate from areas of bowel not injured in the initial injury. This study suggests traditional principles of management for ECF are applicable in ECF following laparotomy for abdominal injury and result in a spontaneous closure of fistulas in one-third of patients. In addition, sepsis is the main indication for early aggressive operative treatment of these fistulas. 
Stroke prevention in women: role of aspirin versus ticlopidine. Stroke is the third leading cause of death in North America. Most studies indicate that women are just as likely as men to have an initial stroke but less likely to have a recurrent stroke. Aspirin and ticlopidine are two antiplatelet drugs that reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by 25% to 30%. In some stroke prevention trials, aspirin has been shown to be more effective for men than for women. In contrast, major stroke prevention trials using ticlopidine have demonstrated equal benefit in women and in men. The overall incidence of adverse effects seen with ticlopidine is not significantly different from that observed with aspirin. There are now two effective agents useful in stroke prevention in both men and women. 
Neutrophil accumulation in ischemic canine myocardium. Insights into time course, distribution, and mechanism of localization during early reperfusion. BACKGROUND. We have previously demonstrated that chemotactic factors released from the ischemic canine myocardium peak early during reperfusion and that they elicit neutrophil adherence reactions in vitro that are dependent on the CD18 glycoprotein family. In this study we investigated the hypothesis that neutrophil localization in ischemic canine myocardium in vivo occurs over a similar time course during early reperfusion and involves a CD18-dependent mechanism. METHODS AND RESULTS. We occluded the circumflex coronary artery for 1 hour in acute, open-chest dogs, followed by reperfusion for 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours. Regional myocardial blood flow was determined using radiolabeled microspheres, and localization was traced using technetium-99m-labeled autologous neutrophils. In the first hour of reperfusion, neutrophil localization occurred preferentially within the subendocardial region and was inversely related to flow. Neutrophil localization diminished across the ischemic myocardium from endocardium to epicardium but remained negatively related to flow in the midmyocardial region. Regardless of flow, little neutrophil localization occurred in the subepicardial region. Neutrophil localization was greatest in the first hour of reperfusion and diminished thereafter. By 4 hours of reperfusion, the rate of localization was markedly attenuated relative to 1 hour. Dogs given anti-CD18 monoclonal antibody R15.7 (1 mg/kg i.v.) before occlusion underwent 1 hour of occlusion followed by 1 hour of reperfusion. When compared with 1-hour reperfusion controls, the R15.7-treated dogs demonstrated significant attenuation of neutrophil localization in the subendocardial region. CONCLUSIONS. These data support the concepts that rapid neutrophil localization during reperfusion occurs within regions of previous myocardial ischemia and that neutrophils preferentially localize within the subendocardial region. The rate of neutrophil localization is greatest within the first hour after the initiation of reperfusion, and localization is, at least in part, CD18 dependent. Therapies directed against neutrophil-mediated reperfusion injury should be initiated with these considerations in mind. 
Establishment and characterization of 20 human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines in a serum-free defined medium (ACL-4). To facilitate the studies in cell biology and drug sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer, cell samples from 55 patients have been used to establish cell lines in culture using a chemically defined medium (ACL-4). A total of 20 cell lines (36 percent) were directly established and characterized: 14 (44 percent) from pleural effusions, five (29 percent) from resected primary tumors, and one (25 percent) from ascitic fluids. They comprised 16 adenocarcinoma, two large cell carcinoma, one squamous cell carcinoma, and one malignant mesothelioma. Each cell line had distinct gross morphologic features and population doubling times from 21 to 75 h. The plating efficiency was 0.01 to 9.51 percent. The modal chromosome number varied from 45 to 108. Secretion of tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, sialyl Lewis Xi, CA 50, CA 125, and CA 19-9) into the medium was also different in each cell line. Most of the cell lines have been xenografted into nude mice and found to be tumorigenic. Survival of 20 patients whose tumor cell specimens continually grew in culture at any time during their clinical course was significantly shorter than that of 35 patients with no in vitro tumour growth (median survival time of 28 weeks vs 53 weeks, p = 0.0093). Our study indicates that in vitro tumor cell growth appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. 
Treatment of refractory peptic ulcer with omeprazole or continued H2 receptor antagonists: a controlled clinical trial. We tested the hypothesis that the gastric H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor, omeprazole, because of its different mode of action and pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion, may be more effective in peptic ulcer that is refractory to histamine H2 receptor antagonist treatment than continuing the same therapy. Altogether 107 patients (duodenal ulcer, n = 88; prepyloric ulcer, n = 14; gastric ulcer, n = 3; mixed sites, n = 2) with refractory peptic ulcer - that is ulcer unhealed after at least two months' treatment with cimetidine 0.8 g or 1 g daily or with ranitidine 0.3 g daily - were randomly allocated to receive either omeprazole 40 mg daily (n = 54) or to continue treatment with the same H2 receptor antagonist and at the same dose (n = 53) for up to eight weeks. The patients in the two treatment groups were well matched demographically. Healing by 'intent to treat' analysis was as follows: at four weeks, omeprazole 46 of 54 (85%), H2 receptor antagonist 18 of 53 (34%) (p less than 0.0001); and at eight weeks, 52 of 54 (96%) and 30 of 53 (57%) respectively (p less than 0.0001). One patient was lost to follow up but of the 22 patients whose ulcers were shown to be unhealed at endoscopy after receiving continued H2 receptor antagonist treatment, 21 healed in four to eight weeks when changed to omeprazole. 
Ras oncogene mutations in benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. Current models for tumorigenesis propose that a series of genetic alterations occur during the progression from the normal cell to the malignant phenotype. Mutations in each of the three ras genes (K-ras, H-ras, and N-ras) have been identified in many human neoplasms, including thyroid cancer. In this study we examined genomic DNA from benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms for mutations that are known to activate the ras oncogenes (codons 12, 13, and 61). DNA from frozen surgically excised tissue (n = 8) and from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (n = 30) was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction and screened for mutations using oligonucleotide-specific hybridization. No mutations were identified in follicular adenomas (n = 9). In follicular carcinomas, 2 of 14 tumors contained mutations (N-ras 61, Gln to Arg), and both of these patients had bone metastases. One of 15 papillary carcinomas had a ras mutation (H-ras 12, Gly to Ser). In contrast to other studies, we found that ras mutations are relatively uncommon in both benign and malignant thyroid neoplasms. Studies of larger numbers of tumors and comparisons of different patient populations will be required to assess a possible association of mutations in N-ras 61 with clinically aggressive follicular cancer. 
Pulsed-field electrophoresis screening for immunoglobulin heavy-chain constant-region (IGHC) multigene deletions and duplications. Genome regions containing multiple copies of homologous genes, such as the immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy-chain constant-region (IGHC) locus, are often unstable and give rise to duplicated and deleted haplotypes. Analysis of such processes is fundamental to understanding the mechanisms of evolution of multigene families. In the IGHC region, a number of single and multiple gene deletions, derived from either unequal crossing-over or looping-out excision, have been described. To study these haplotypes at the population level, a simple and efficient method for preparing large numbers of DNA samples suitable for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was set up, and a sample of 110 blood donors was screened. Deletions were found to be frequent, as expected on the basis of previous serological surveys for homozygotes. Furthermore, a number of multigene duplications, never identified before, were detected. The total frequency of individuals bearing rearranged IGHC haplotypes was 10%. The genes involved in these deletions and duplications were assessed by densitometric analysis of standard Southern blots hybridized with several IGHC probes; two types of deletion and two types of duplication could thus be characterized. These data provide further evidence of the instability of the IGHC locus and demonstrate that unequal crossing-over is the most likely origin of rearranged IGHC haplotypes; they also suggest that such recombination events may be relatively frequent. Moreover, the simplicity and effectiveness of the large-scale PFGE screening approach will be of great help in the study of multigene families and of other loci involved in aberrant recombinations. 
Vasculitic skin ulcers associated with myelofibrosis--a case report. This is the case report of a seventy-seven-year-old woman with ulcerated skin vasculitis of the lower extremities that preceded the appearance of myelofibrosis. No previous report of this association has been found in a survey of the literature. 
White sponge naevus and ocular coloboma. White sponge naevus occurred in association with coloboma of the iris in six members of one family, across three generations. The association of these two dominantly inherited conditions has not to our knowledge previously been described. 
Posterior urethral valves presenting as venous obstruction. A patient with posterior urethral valves presented with unilateral lower leg ecchymosis and edema. He initially had significant renal function impairment. The ecchymosis and edema resolved after appropriate therapy, and his renal function returned to normal. 
Nicotine potentiation of haloperidol in reducing tic frequency in Tourette's disorder [published erratum appears in Am J Psychiatry 1991 Sep;148(9):1282] In an open, nonblind study, 10 patients with Tourette's disorder who were being treated with haloperidol were videotaped before, while, and after chewing nicotine gum. The frequency of tics was reduced significantly during the 30-minute gum-chewing period and during the 1 hour after gum chewing. Nicotine appears to potentiate haloperidol effects in patients with Tourette's disorder. 
Prophylaxis of stress ulcer bleeding. A meta-analysis. Recent studies have reported upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding in 5-25% of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with severe stress despite the use of antacids and/or H2-antagonists. To evaluate the efficacy of this regimen, a meta-analysis of all prospective studies on the prevention of stress bleeding, available from the international literature, was conducted. Only macroscopically visible bleeds were considered. Because alkalinization of the gastric juice has been incriminated in facilitating gastric and pulmonary colonization, agents with little or no influence on the gastric pH have been increasingly investigated in stress bleeding prophylaxis. The meta-analysis was therefore extended to determine the efficacy of two newer substances, pirenzepine and sucralfate, in preventing macroscopically visible stress bleeding, as well as their influence on pulmonary infections and mortality. Antacids and H2-antagonists proved to be significantly superior to untreated controls, with the tendency in favor of antacids administered in short intervals as compared to H2-antagonists. Pirenzepine and sucralfate were significantly superior to H2-antagonists, and sucralfate was as effective as an adequate antacid regimen. Patient groups treated with antacids or H2-antagonists showed a significantly higher risk for the development of nosocomial pneumonia. The most significant differences was found in long-term ventilated patients compared with patients treated with sucralfate. In the same patient group, antacids and H2-antagonists also showed a significantly higher mortality rate than sucralfate. 
The significance of portal vein thrombosis after distal splenorenal shunt. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of portal vein thrombosis after the distal splenorenal shunt, to identify any predictive factors, and to assess the clinical significance of this complication. Preoperative and postoperative angiograms and clinical evaluation were reviewed in 124 patients who underwent distal splenorenal shunts. Total and partial portal vein thrombosis were seen on 13 (10.5%) and 22 (17.7%) postoperative angiograms, respectively. The only preoperative variable correlating with development of portal vein thrombosis was portal venous perfusion, which was significantly lower in patients with than in those without portal vein thrombosis. In six of 10 patients with postoperative pancreatitis, portal vein thrombosis developed. The frequency of early postoperative complications was significantly greater in patients with total portal vein thrombosis than in those with partial or no thrombosis. Long-term follow-up has shown no significant effects of portal vein thrombosis on late ascites, encephalopathy, or survival. 
Macrophage apolipoprotein synthesis and endoneurial distribution as a response to segmental demyelination. The synthesis and endoneurial distribution of apolipoproteins in response to myelin degradation was elucidated morphologically and biochemically in rodent models of segmental demyelination. At the onset of acute demyelination induced by tellurium (Te) poisoning, macrophages infiltrated the endoneurium and then began to express cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for apolipoprotein E (apo E). When demyelinating nerve slices were incubated with S35-methionine, radiolabeled apo E was released, showing that apo E was actively synthesized by the macrophages. Macrophages secreted apo E into the endoneurial spaces, leading to dense endoneurial accumulations. Other apolipoproteins (apo A1 and albumin) were not synthesized in the endoneurium, but they entered edematous nerves, presumably through an early breakdown in the blood-nerve barrier. During the phagocytosis of myelin, plasma-derived apolipoproteins accumulated within some of the macrophages. In chronic demyelination caused by lead poisoning, the cellular and extracellular distribution of apolipoproteins was similar to Te neuropathy; the amount of apo E accumulation and the macrophage density were proportional to the prevalence of active demyelination in teased fibers. Similar patterns of endoneurial apo E were present in an inherited form of demyelination in the twitcher mouse, after antibody-mediated demyelination, and in demyelination secondary to axonal degeneration. Human sural nerve biopsies had patterns of apolipoprotein E antigenicity that were comparable to the rodent models. We conclude that secretion of apo E by infiltrating macrophages is a generalized response to demyelination, and that endoneurial edema leads to the accumulation of certain plasma apolipoproteins within macrophages. These data suggest that endoneurial apolipoproteins and macrophages might mediate important functions in patients recovering from primary and secondary demyelination. 
Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome. The association of congenital ablepharon with the absence of eyelashes and eyebrows, a wide mouth (macrostomia), and auricular, nasal, genital, and other systemic anomalies has been termed the ablepharon macrostomia syndrome. One such case is reported which illustrates the importance of immediate postnatal ocular management to minimise severe visual loss. 
Daily chronic headache. Headache is a disabling condition, and medical science has not, until recently, begun to address it in a fashion consistent with its widespread impact. Despite the limitations in our current understanding, as well as the historical prejudice directed toward patients with this condition, current understanding and treatment approaches can provide hope and relief for most patients who have these disorders. 
Bilateral retinal hamartomas in neurofibromatosis type 2. We report a case of bilateral retinal hamartomas in a child with neurofibromatosis type 2. This unique case demonstrates that a diversity of retinal changes can occur in this disease. 
Prevalence and severity of morbidity among Gujarati Asian elders: a controlled comparison. Asian elders make relatively heavy use of health services: this may be due to higher levels of morbidity, but controlled comparisons have not been carried out. A comparison of the prevalence and severity of chronic diseases and use of health services of Asian and indigenous elders was made. A sample of 59 Gujarati Asians of mean age 62.9 years and 59 indigenous subjects of mean age 63.9 years of whom 42% (25 in each group) were female drawn from a general practice was studied. Asian subjects had a higher prevalence of diagnosed diseases, with the exception of chronic obstructive airways disease, but lower risk of falls and urinary incontinence. Asian subjects had higher life satisfaction scores and lower prevalence of depressed mood. Asian women were more likely to have had contact with primary care services. Both Asian men and women had more frequent hospital admissions, but similar levels of out-patient attendance. Body mass index, blood pressure and shoulder joint range of movement were similar for both Asians and the indigenous population. Asian subjects had significantly lower peak expiratory flow rates and hand grip strength. Asian elders have a higher risk of chronic diseases, but the impact of disease (indicated by life satisfaction, mood, and common disabilities) is less than among the indigenous population. Lower peak expiratory flow rates and grip strength among Asian elders are of concern since they may lead to premature arrival at age-related thresholds of physical capacity essential for independence in activities of daily living. 
Abrupt vessel closure following platelet transfusion post-PTCA. A successful PTCA was complicated by abrupt closure following a platelet transfusion which was given for control of local bleeding. Possible mechanisms of abrupt closure are discussed. Recommendation is made to avoid giving platelet transfusion following PTCA. 
Why all placentas should be examined by a pathologist in 1990 Placental pathology is rarely a part of the training for either obstetrician or pathologist. As a result there has been confusion regarding the potential benefits of routine placental examination. These benefits include clarification of the causes of many adverse pregnancy outcomes, improvement of the risk assessment for future pregnancies, and ascertainment of newborn risk for long-term neurodevelopment sequelae. Information on placental abnormalities may reveal the presence of chronic fetal insults and allow their differentiation from acute (peripartum) stresses. Current methods of risk assessment fail to identify the majority of pregnancies that end in prematurity, stillbirth, growth retardation, or fetal distress. We suggest that placental pathology should be a routine component of obstetric-neonatal care. 
Gaze-dependent hemianopia without hemispatial neglect. A hemispheric field is the space defined by the midsagittal plane of the body. Hemianopia, in the absence of hemispheric spatial neglect, has been thought to be purely retinotopic. Confrontation testing of visual fields in eccentric positions of gaze in hemianopic patients permits the discrimination of hemispheric from retinotopic deficits. In the primary position of gaze, a patient with an ischemic lesion of the right occipital and temporal lobes, who was without unilateral spatial neglect, was unable to detect finger movement, name objects, or identify shapes or colors in the left retinotopic hemifield, but when gazing 30 degrees to the right (so that the left retinotopic field was in the right hemispheric field), he performed nearly as well in the left retinotopic field as in the right. The mechanism of this gaze-dependent hemifield visual impairment is unknown, but we discuss four possibilities: (1) eccentric gaze enhances an alternative visual system; (2) the lesion led to modality-specific hemispheric inattention that was corrected by directing intention (plan to act) and gazing to the right; (3) the lesion led to modality specific inattention that was corrected by compensatory mechanisms that may normally enhance attentive vigilance in central space during eccentric gaze; and (4) the neuronal substrate for hemispheric vision was destroyed, whereas that for retinotopic vision was preserved. 
Coronary heart disease risk markers in users of low-dose oral contraceptives. Seven combination oral contraceptives (OCs) were studied for their effects on glucose, insulin, triglyceride and lipoprotein concentrations. Subjects included 925 women using fixed-dose (monophasic) or variable-dose (triphasic) formulations and 418 premenopausal women not using OCs. The monophasics contained 150 or 250 micrograms of levonorgestrel, 500 or 1,000 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel as the progestin. Triphasic progestin doses were 50-125 micrograms of levonorgestrel or 500-1,000 micrograms of norethindrone. All the formulations increased the fasting serum triglycerides. No changes were seen in serum total cholesterol. The effects on serum lipoproteins depended on the progestin type and dose. Monophasics containing 500 micrograms of norethindrone or 150 micrograms of desogestrel lowered low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Monophasics containing levonorgestrel reduced HDL cholesterol. The triphasics did not affect LDL or HDL cholesterol but altered the balance of HDL subfractions. All the formulations caused a deterioration in glucose tolerance and insulin resistance and increased pancreatic insulin secretion. The greatest effects were seen with formulations containing levonorgestrel. The study showed that a reduction in the progestin dose and use of novel progestins can reduce the potentially adverse effects of OCs on metabolic risk markers for coronary heart disease. 
Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of uveal tumors. We detected seven tumors with magnetic resonance imaging, which demonstrate some of the uses and limitations of this diagnostic technique. In one patient, the correct diagnosis of extraocular extension was demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging when both clinical and ultrasonographic data were not diagnostic. In another case, an extremely small area of extraocular extension was detected with ultrasound evaluation but was not noted on magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reliable in the detection of intraocular tumors. In pigmented uveal melanomas it is both sensitive and highly specific. In amelanotic processes magnetic resonance imaging can identify a mass but cannot always adequately characterize it. Further experience will be necessary to determine the proper role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of uveal tumors. 
Socioeconomic status and visual impairment among urban Americans. Baltimore Eye Survey Research Group. The Baltimore Eye Survey is a population-based study of ocular disorders conducted in East Baltimore, Md, designed to determine the prevalence and severity of vision loss and ocular disease and their relationships to socioeconomic and other risk factors. This survey comprised 5300 subjects (2911 whites and 2389 blacks). Visual impairment was associated with age, race, general health status, educational level, income, and employment status. An identified association of race with blindness and visual impairment was reduced, but not eliminated, after adjustment for these socioeconomic factors, indicating that socioeconomic status itself is an important determinant of visual impairment. 
Open reduction and internal fixation of two-part displaced fractures of the greater tuberosity of the proximal part of the humerus. Twelve patients, ranging in age from thirty-four to seventy-two years (average, fifty-three years), were evaluated an average of five years (range, two to eight years) after open reduction and internal fixation of a two-part displaced fracture of the greater tuberosity of the proximal part of the humerus. The indication for operative reduction was one centimeter or more of displacement of the fracture as seen on the diagnostic radiographs. The anterosuperior deltoid-splitting approach, combined with rotation of the humerus, allowed adequate exposure of the retracted tuberosity. Internal fixation of the greater tuberosity with heavy, non-absorbable sutures and careful repair of the rotator cuff permitted early passive motion. All fractures healed without postoperative displacement. Six patients had an excellent result and six had a good result; active elevation averaged 170 degrees. There was one partial, transient palsy of the axillary nerve. 
Steps towards cost-benefit analysis of regional neurosurgical care OBJECTIVE--To determine the cost of averting death or severe disability by neurosurgical intervention. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis of one year's admissions for neurosurgery; comparison of outcome with expected outcome in the absence of neurosurgical intervention and with the cost of neurosurgery. SETTING--Wessex Neurological Centre. PATIENTS--1026 Patients were admitted to the neurosurgical service in 1984. Of 1185 admissions, 978 case records were available and outcome was known in 919. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Outcome was assessed with the Glasgow outcome scale, modified as necessary, from the case notes, or by letter follow up to the general practitioner. Expected outcomes for each of the 54 diagnoses were derived from both published reports where available and an expert panel of 18 consultant neurosurgeons. The cost of the neurosurgical service for 1983-4 was known from a separate study and the cost per patient was calculated using the length of stay. RESULTS--The cost of neurosurgery in 1983-4 was 1.8 million pounds. In all, 243 deaths or severe disabilities were estimated to have been averted at an average cost of 7325 pounds (range 5000 pounds to 70,000 pounds). The overall cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) was 350 pounds (range 34 pounds to greater than 400,000 pounds). The cost of long term care for severely disabled survivors is at least 18-fold greater than the cost of neurosurgical intervention to avert such disability. CONCLUSIONS--In Britain neurosurgery is not expensive in comparison with the costs and benefits of other areas of medicine, and the cost per QALY is unexpectedly low except for severe diffuse head injury, malignant brain tumors, and cerebral metastases. The neurosurgical budget should be assessed in the context of managing a patient in hospital and subsequently in the community. 
Double-blind placebo-controlled trial of buflomedil in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon: six-month follow-up. The efficacy of buflomedil in reducing the mean daily frequency and severity of winter ischemic attacks has been shown in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including 31 patients (16 in the buflomedil group, 15 in the placebo group) suffering from idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon and followed up for six months. The efficacy was confirmed by nail fold capillaroscopy, which showed a significant alleviation of hemodymanic disturbances and background pallor in comparison with the placebo. Results in terms of clinical and laboratory safety parameters assessed over a six-month period were satisfactory, thus demonstrating the possibility of a long-term treatment. 
Review article: migraine and pregnancy. A 27-year-old woman with no family or personal history of migraine presented with headache associated with unilateral paresthesias and blurred vision. This was her first, and so far only, attack of migraine with aura and led to the diagnosis of her pregnancy and to this review. Migraine can begin for the first time with pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester. Cases of migraine with aura are the most commonly reported. Preexisting migraine usually improves with pregnancy, particularly if it was associated with menstrual migraine. Headache occurs frequently in the post-partum period, particularly in known migraineurs. Migraineurs have no increased risk of complications during pregnancy and their children have no increased incidence of birth defects. 
Foodborne outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by Escherichia coli O157:H7--North Dakota, 1990. In late July and early August 1990, an outbreak of gastroenteritis occurred among persons who had eaten a meal while attending an agricultural threshing show in North Dakota on July 28-29. At least 70 (3.5%) of the more than 2000 attendees were affected; of these, 16 persons were hospitalized, and two children, aged 2 and 8 years, were diagnosed with hemolytic uremic syndrome. An epidemiologic investigation was conducted by the North Dakota State Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories. 
Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis possible responsibility of captopril in the development of lesions. Kaposi's sarcoma appeared 8 months after the start of captopril treatment in a 70-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis. A marked reduction of cutaneous and gastric lesions occurred when captopril was stopped. These findings are compared to immunosuppressive drug induced forms of Kaposi's sarcoma. 
Non-invasive assessment of perioperative myocardial cell damage by circulating cardiac troponin T. Troponin T is a unique cardiac antigen which is continuously released from infarcting myocardium. Its cardiospecificity as a marker protein might be particularly useful in assessing myocardial cell damage in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Therefore, circulating troponin T was measured in serial blood samples from 56 patients undergoing cardiac surgery and in two control groups--22 patients undergoing minor orthopaedic surgery and 12 patients undergoing lung surgery by median sternotomy. In both control groups no troponin T could be detected, whereas activities of creatine kinase were raised in all 12 lung surgery controls and activities of the MB isoenzyme were raised in five of the 12 patients in the lung surgery group and in four of the 22 patients in the orthopaedic surgery group, respectively. All the patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 47) and cardiac surgery for other reasons (n = 9) had detectable concentrations of troponin T. Five patients had perioperative myocardial infarction detected as new Q waves and R wave reductions. In these five patients troponin T release persisted and serum concentrations (5.5-23 micrograms/l) reached a peak on the fourth postoperative day. In the 51 patients without perioperative myocardial infarction serum concentrations and the release kinetics of troponin T depended on the duration of cardiac arrest. In patients in whom aortic cross clamping was short troponin T increased slightly on the first postoperative days; in patients with longer periods of aortic cross clamping troponin T concentrations were higher and remained so beyond the fifth postoperative day. 
Hemodialysis grafts: color Doppler flow imaging correlated with digital subtraction angiography and functional status. Twenty-two patients with hemodialysis grafts were prospectively evaluated with color Doppler flow imaging and digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Eighteen patients had normal functional parameters during hemodialysis, and four had increased venous pressure during hemodialysis. Color Doppler flow imaging allowed identification of nine macroaneurysms related to wall degeneration, two cases of spontaneous fistula formation between the graft and peripheral veins, and 20 stenoses. Use of color Doppler flow imaging led to overestimation of the degree of stenosis at the venous anastomosis when compared with use of angiography. Three cases of subclavian venous stenosis were identified only at angiography. Color Doppler flow imaging appears accurate in the detection of stenoses and seems sufficient for follow-up of normally functioning grafts. However, because of its low sensitivity for identification of proximal stenoses and the necessity of obtaining an angiogram to plan surgical or percutaneous correction, DSA remains the technique of choice. 
Coronary artery narrowing due to extrinsic compression by myocardial abscess. A case of aortic valve endocarditis complicated by perivalvular abscess extending into myocardium is presented. Echocardiography and aortography failed to detect the abscess, but coronary angiography revealed its presence by extrinsic compression of left anterior descending and diagonal arteries. Morphological features of this rare cause for coronary narrowing are described. 
Low angiotensinogen levels are related to the severity and liver dysfunction of congestive heart failure: implications for renin measurements. PURPOSE: To compare the determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) and the direct measurement of active renin by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) as methods of assessing the renin system in patients with congestive heart failure. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The status of the renin-angiotensin system in congestive heart failure was assessed by measuring the plasma renin substrate concentration, PRA, and plasma concentration of active renin in 37 patients with mild to severe congestive heart failure. Natremia and plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were determined as biologic indexes of the severity of heart failure, and concentrations of prealbumin and retinol-binding protein were used as indexes of liver dysfunction. RESULTS: The PRA and the concentrations of active renin and ANF were markedly higher in patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure than in patients with class II to III heart failure, while natremia and the concentrations of renin substrate, prealbumin, and retinol-binding protein were markedly lower in the class IV patients than in the class II to III patients. Plasma renin substrate concentration was negatively correlated with active renin concentration (n = 37, r = -0.45, p = 0.005), and positively related to natremia (r = 0.56, p less than 0.0005), prealbumin (r = 0.54, p less than 0.001), and retinol-binding protein (r = 0.60, p less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of plasma renin substrate can be considered as an indirect index of the severity of heart failure that reflects both the high level of circulating active renin and the decrease in hepatic protein output. In patients with class IV heart failure, low levels of renin substrate led to a marked underestimation of active renin concentration from measurements of PRA. In contrast, direct IRMA of active renin measures the true plasma active renin concentration, independent of plasma renin substrate, and closely reflects renin secretion. 
Human astrocytes contain two distinct angiotensin receptor subtypes. The ability of angiotensin peptides to stimulate prostaglandin release and raise intracellular calcium levels by activating a phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C was assessed in three human astrocytoma cell lines (CRTG3, STTG1, and WITG2). The addition of angiotensin II to CRTG3 cells resulted in a dose-dependent release of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin, the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, and the mobilization of intracellular calcium. Angiotensin-(1-7), previously considered to be an inactive metabolite of angiotensin II, was as potent as angiotensin II for prostaglandin release but did not activate phospholipase C or mobilize intracellular calcium. In contrast, angiotensin-(2-8) caused only a slight increase in prostaglandin release, even though it was as effective as angiotensin II in augmenting inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and calcium mobilization. Moreover, neither the release of prostaglandins in response to angiotensin II or angiotensin-(1-7) nor the mobilization of intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II required extracellular calcium. Angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7) caused the release of prostaglandins from all three human astrocytoma cell lines, but changes in the level of intracellular calcium in response to angiotensin II only occurred in CRTG3 cells. Although previous studies have provided evidence for angiotensin receptor subtypes on the basis of selectivity of antagonists or signal transduction mechanisms, these data suggest that human astrocytes contain multiple angiotensin receptor subtypes on the basis of their response to different angiotensin heptapeptides--angiotensin-(1-7) and angiotensin-(2-8). 
Surgical and chemotherapeutic treatment of hepatic metastases from carcinoma of the breast. To date, no five year survival rates have been reported for patients with hepatic metastases (HM) from breast origin treated by chemotherapy or hormone therapy. This study was done to evaluate whether or not surgical excision of such metastatic disease associated with chemotherapy has any effect on such a poor prognosis. Between May 1985 and September 1988, 22 patients with a diagnosis of isolated (solitary or multiple) HM have been surgically treated. The therapeutic approach also included systemic preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy. Laparotomy findings for those 22 patients are presented. There were benign hepatic lesions in four patients (four different histologic types) and hepatectomy was done in two patients. Diffuse metastatic disease contraindicated any attempt at hepatic resection in six patients. Hepatectomy was possible in 12 patients. There was no postoperative mortality and minimal morbidity. One-half of the patients with metastases had one or more positive lymph nodes at the hepatic pedicule. Median survival time for 12 patients treated by hepatectomy was 37 +/- 9 months after hepatectomy and 42 +/- 3 months after the discovery of HM. Eleven patients had other metastases after an average period of 11.8 months after hepatectomy, and the liver was the first site of recurrence in eight. One patient underwent a hepatectomy twice. Two patients were free of disease 29 to 46 months postoperatively in spite of poor prognostic features on the excised specimen. Although the median survival time was two times better than with usual treatment, we believe this procedure is of doubtful benefit. In this situation, hepatectomy acts as cytoreductive surgical treatment, with the main limiting factor being the relatively low effectiveness of chemotherapy. This type of therapy can be applied only to a restricted number of patients, and if we decide to proceed with this study, we will have to modify the protocol of chemotherapy radically. 
The Health of the Public Program at the University of Washington: a new role for academic medical centers. The University of Washington Health of the Public Program has convened a consortium composed of the region's academic medical center, the two largest managed care plans in Washington, and representatives of the state's major private and public purchasers of health care. The consortium's purpose is to test the feasibility of collaboratively collecting cross-system data, assessing variations in practice, and implementing site-specific interventions to improve the management of common illnesses and encourage preventive care. Changes under way in the ambulatory training environment and in the undergraduate curriculum as a result of the consortium's initial efforts are described. In today's climate of cost consciousness and concerns about quality, academic medical centers can play an important role in helping to improve community-wide outcomes of care. 
Noninvasive detection of reperfusion in acute myocardial infarction based on plasma activity of creatine kinase MB subforms. Successful thrombolytic therapy is associated with an accelerated release of creatine kinase (CK) MB from necrotic myocardium. With use of a previously validated assay, the plasma kinetics of the myocardial subform (MB2) and the plasma-modified subform (MB1) were determined in blood samples obtained from 56 patients with acute Q wave myocardial infarction: 33 patients who received thrombolytic therapy (group A) and 23 patients managed conservatively (group B). Plasma MB2 activity increased more rapidly in the group A patients, but there was substantial overlap with group B. Plasma MB1 activity did not differ significantly between the two groups. The MB2/MB1 ratio was significantly higher in group A patients than in group B patients between 2 and 10 h after the onset of infarction. Among group A patients, the ratio increased from 2.4 +/- 1.6 to 4.6 +/- 2.0 in the 1st h after therapy (p less than 0.001). The peak ratio was 6.3 +/- 2.5 in group A patients and 3.1 +/- 1.2 in group B patients. Twenty-seven of the 33 group A patients had a peak ratio greater than 3.8 versus 5 of the 23 group B patients (p less than 0.001). In seven group A patients, the ratio was greater than 3.8 before plasma CK MB activity was out of the normal range. Angiography was performed at 5.0 +/- 3.5 days in 39 patients. Eighteen (90%) of 20 patients with a patent infarct-related artery had a peak ratio greater than 3.8; 17 (89.5%) of 19 patients with an occluded infarct-related artery had a ratio less than 3.8 (p less than 0.001). 
Estimate of breast cancer risk reduction with weight loss. Upper body fat localization has been associated with an increased risk of cancer. This study demonstrated that 64.2% of 124 women with at least a 4.5-kg weight loss decreased their upper body fat localization, as measured by a reduction in their suprailiac-thigh skin fold ratio and other skin fold thicknesses associated with upper body fat localization. Based on a risk model previously developed for breast cancer and upper body fat localization, a reduction in estimated breast cancer relative risk of 45% was calculated for the entire group of women who lost 4.5 kg or more in weight. Greater weight loss further reduced upper body fat localization and estimated breast cancer risk based on this model. 
Severity of childhood bacterial meningitis and duration of illness before diagnosis. Rapid diagnosis of childhood bacterial meningitis (BM) is generally believed to be essential to avoid poor outcome. To see whether duration of illness before admission to hospital was related to the severity of illness, data from children with BM diagnosed in 18 paediatric hospitals in Finland from 1984 to 1989 were collected prospectively. We divided 286 cases with culture-positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into three groups: BM with a history of up to 24 h (short-history group, n = 141), of more than 24 h and up to 48 h (intermediate-history group, n = 75), and of more than 48 h (long-history group, n = 70). The longer the history, the better the clinical condition of the child. If symptoms or signs of BM lasted 48 h or less, the child did significantly worse, as judged by seven variables, than if the history was longer than 48 h (level of consciousness, p less than 0.001; seizures, p less than 0.01; CSF protein concentration, p less than 0.001; positive CSF gram-stain, p less than 0.01; positive blood culture, p less than 0.05 in Haemophilus influenzae meningitis; serum C-reactive protein, p less than 0.01 between intermediate-history and long-history groups; and urine sodium concentration, p less than 0.001). The differences were not affected by causative organism, sex, age, or preadmission oral antimicrobial agents. The findings show that if BM follows an insidious pattern of disease, diagnostic delay may be unavoidable, which may have medicolegal implications. 
Successful treatment of a persistent cyst, developing after ovarian transposition, with leuprolide acetate. Persistent ovarian cysts are considered to be the most troublesome complication of ovarian transposition. Transabdominal drainage or surgical removal is often required. This paper reports the successful use of leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, in the treatment of a symptomatic and persistent ovarian cyst which developed after ovarian transposition. The benefits of this therapy over others are discussed. 
Hereditary ataxias and paraplegias in Cantabria, Spain. An epidemiological and clinical study. A clinical, genetic and epidemiological study of hereditary ataxias and paraplegias was conducted within a defined area (Cantabria) in Northern Spain from 1974 to 1986. The series comprised 48 index cases and 65 affected relatives. On prevalence day, 103 patients were alive, giving a prevalence of 20.2 cases per 100,000. There were 24 patients (18 families) with Friedreich's ataxia (FA), 12 (6 families) with early onset cerebellar ataxia (EOCA) differing from FA, 6 (3 families) with dominantly transmitted late onset cerebellar ataxia (LOCA), 11 with 'idiopathic' LOCA, 49 (9 families) with 'pure' hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), and 1 patient with congenital cerebellar ataxia. The prevalence found here is comparable with the highest figures described in previous surveys. This may in part be due to the great number of secondary cases in our series. A high frequency of parental consanguinity occurred in FA patients, 'pseudodominant' inheritance being observed in 1 family. The clinical features were those of classical FA except for later onset and slower course in 1 family, and retained tendon reflexes in the lower limbs in 2 cases. Such data indicate the need for modification of the essential criteria for the disease. EOCA included 4 patients with normoreflexic ataxia and 1 patient with ataxia and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone deficiency. In addition, there were 7 patients from 2 unrelated families with a homogeneous syndrome characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance, cerebellar ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and sensory neuropathy. This syndrome is therefore a well defined nosological entity to be added to the list of autosomal recessive mendelian phenotypes. The clinical picture of patients with LOCA was either a 'pure' cerebellar or a 'cerebellar-plus' syndrome. Genetic subgroups of 'pure' HSP were autosomal dominant type I in 5 families and type II in 2, and autosomal recessive in 2 families. 
C-reactive protein as an index of disease activity. Comparison of tenidap, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone in rat adjuvant arthritis. C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations are a useful plasma protein measure that correlate with disease severity and radiographic progression in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We compared 3 drugs with different mechanisms, i.e., tenidap, dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, on both CRP levels and soft tissue swelling in the rat adjuvant arthritis model. CRP rose from a normal concentration of approximately 400 micrograms/ml during the first phase of adjuvant arthritis to approximately 1200 micrograms/ml (primary response), then fell to approximately 900 micrograms/ml and rose again as the disease became systemic during the secondary response to approximately 1400 micrograms/ml. When treatment was administered prophylactically, tenidap and dexamethasone suppressed both the primary and secondary CRP and swelling responses. Cyclophosphamide was without effect in the primary response, but inhibited both swelling and CRP in the secondary response. When therapeutic treatment was begun after secondary disease was established, only tenidap and dexamethasone inhibited CRP and swelling. Both dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide decreased lymphocyte numbers during treatment whereas lymphocyte numbers were elevated during tenidap treatment, suggesting a different mechanism of action for tenidap. CRP levels were more closely linked to the rate of change of paw swelling (disease progression) than to paw volume. 
Treatment of ulcerated hemangiomas with the pulsed tunable dye laser. Hemangiomas are the most common tumor of infancy and are characterized by rapid growth during the first 6 months of life. During the rapid growth phase, approximately 5% to 10% of the hemangiomas ulcerate. Ulcerated lesions are painful, may bleed, and are at risk for bacterial infection. Previous therapy has included daily local wound care, topical antibiotics, and local and systemic steroids. We treated nine infants (eight female and one male) with ulcerated hemangiomas by means of a vascular-specific (585-nm) pulsed (450-microsecond) tunable dye laser. Eight of the nine patients had a single ulceration, whereas one patient had two ulcerations within a large hemangioma. Six of the ulcerations healed with a single laser treatment. One ulceration required two treatments to heal, and the remaining two required three treatments. Pain was subjectively decreased within 2 to 3 days in all patients after a single treatment. The pulsed tunable dye laser should be considered in the treatment of all ulcerated hemangiomas. 
Randomised trial of laxatives in treatment of childhood encopresis. Primary faecal incontinence (encopresis) in children is usually treated with laxative medication and a behaviour modification programme aimed at promoting regular toileting, but the effectiveness of laxatives has never been adequately investigated. 169 children with encopresis and evidence of stool on plain abdominal radiograph were randomly allocated to receive multimodal (MM) therapy (laxatives plus behaviour modification; n = 83) or behaviour modification alone (BM; n = 86). Mean (SD) follow-up was 55.1 (27.0) weeks and 56.7 (32.0) weeks, respectively. By 12 months' follow-up 42 (51%) of the MM group and 31 (36%) of the BM group (p = 0.079) had achieved remission (at least one 4 week period with no soiling episodes) and 52 (63%) vs 37 (43%) (p = 0.016) had achieved at least partial remission (soiling no more than once a week). MM subjects achieved remission significantly sooner than BM subjects, and the difference in the Kaplan-Meier remission curves was most striking in the first 30 weeks of follow-up (p = 0.012). The patterns of compliance with toileting in the treatment groups were almost identical, although about 1 in 8 children overall did not comply with the sitting programme. After exclusion of the 24 poor compliers, there was no significant difference between BM and MM groups. This study shows a clear advantage overall for the use of laxative medication, although the benefit may not be as great for children who are able to maintain regular toileting. 
Benign pleural effusions in long-standing diabetes mellitus. We studied intractable pleural effusions in five patients with long-standing diabetes mellitus and an additional 40 patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction to determine whether the frequency of pleural effusions is increased in diabetic patients and, if so, the relation of pleural effusions to left ventricular dysfunction. In our initial observations, effusions were benign, were not always associated with congestive heart failure (CHF), and reaccumulated following thoracentesis. Effusions associated with CHF persisted despite medical treatment and improvement of CHF. In our study of 40 patients with similar degrees of left ventricular dysfunction, the incidence of pleural effusions in diabetic patients was 83 percent and in our nondiabetic patients was 14 percent (p less than 0.001). We conclude that pleural effusions occur more commonly in diabetic than nondiabetic patients and may be related to left ventricular dysfunction and possibly other factors leading to increased effusion. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy of high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity. Updated results of the Multi-Institutional Osteosarcoma Study. The Multi-Institutional Osteosarcoma Study (MIOS) was designed to determine whether intensive multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy improves the outcome of patients with nonmetastatic high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity as compared with concurrent controls. After definitive surgery of the primary tumor, patients were randomly assigned to immediate adjuvant chemotherapy or to observation without adjuvant treatment. Updated results of this trial indicate that the projected six-year event-free survival for the control group is 11% compared to 61% for the chemotherapy group (p less than 0.001). Similar results were observed in patients who declined randomization but who were followed according to the treatment arms of the protocol. When randomized and nonrandomized patients are pooled according to assigned treatment, a survival advantage favoring those patients treated with immediate adjuvant chemotherapy is apparent. An analysis of prognostic factors among patients receiving immediate adjuvant chemotherapy reveals that elevation of the serum lactic dehydrogenase at diagnosis is the factor most predictive of adverse outcome. Location of the primary site in the tibia confers a favorable prognosis. The authors conclude that the natural history of high-grade osteosarcoma of the extremity has not changed over the past two decades. The administration of immediate adjuvant chemotherapy has a significant favorable impact on event-free survival and should be recommended for all such patients. 
The transmandibular implant: a 13-year survey of its use. During the period from August 1976 until July 1989 the transmandibular implant was introduced in a total of 31 oral and maxillofacial surgery departments in the Netherlands and 1,466 patients were treated. This study includes 1,356 treated patients from 28 departments. The treatment course of 1,201 patients (89.6%) was uneventful. Of the 157 complications, 58 related to the anatomic contour of the mandible, 49 to the surgery, 25 to the prosthetic reconstruction, 8 to the psychosocial attitude of the patient, 8 to the use of medication, 5 to trauma, and 4 to the presence of a skin graft. Treatment of the complications included removal of the implant in 44 patients; in 106 patients the complication was treated satisfactorily. In the remaining 7 patients, hypesthesia was present. The reasons for the removal of the 44 implants were infection (11), operative error (5), premature loading of the implant (3), insufficient width of the mandible after a visor osteotomy (1), loss of osseointegration caused by the prosthesis (14), psychological problems (4), trauma (3), drug-related gingival hyperplasia (2), and inexplicable pain (1). The present survey shows a consistent success rate of 96.8%. 
Conservative management of intraductal carcinoma (DCIS) of the breast. Collaborating NSABP investigators. Seventy-six patients with intraductal carcinoma (DCIS) of the breast have been observed for 83 months (range 50-141) following treatment by lumpectomy (L) only (21), L and breast irradiation (XRT) (27), or mastectomy (28). All represented examples of DCIS retrieved after pathologic examination of a much larger cohort of patients with stage I and II invasive breast cancer enrolled in NSABP protocol 6. Local breast recurrences were similar for women with DCIS and those from this cohort at a similar period of follow-up with invasive cancer treated by L only (43% vs. 39%) and L + XRT (7% vs. 10%). The presence of moderate/marked comedonecrosis was suggestively related to local breast recurrence (P = .07). This latter was significantly reduced for patients receiving post L XRT (P = .01). All local breast recurrences in this study and 29 of 31 recorded by others occurred at or close to the site of extirpation of the index cancer minimizing multicentricity as a contraindication for the conservative surgical treatment of DCIS. Survival rates which were similar for patients with DCIS regardless of form of local treatment were better than that observed for negative node patients with invasive cancer enrolled in protocol 6. Thus, DCIS is a less, not more, ominous disease than invasive cancer. This and other features of its natural history indicate that it would be a contradiction to treat invasive cancer but not DCIS conservatively. 
Maple syrup urine disease. Complete defect of the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex due to a deletion of an 11-bp repeat sequence which encodes a mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in a family with the disease. Branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) deficiency results in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). We examined the molecular basis of familial cases of MSUD by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and genome structure of the affected enzyme. The BCKDH activity in the proband with MSUD was approximately 6% of the normal control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH was absent and that the E1 alpha subunit of BCKDH was markedly reduced. We amplified the cDNAs of the E1 alpha subunit and the E1 beta subunit of the BCKDH complex obtained from cells of the patient, using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNAs. The deduced amino acid sequence for the E1 alpha subunit of the patient's cell was normal. An 11-bp deletion was identified in the region that encoded the mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in the E1 beta cDNA. This 11-bp sequence is found in the first exon of the BCKDH-E1 beta gene, as a direct tandem repeat. Amplification of genomic DNA revealed that the consanguineous parents were heterozygous for this mutant allele, and sister and brother of the patient with the disease were homozygous for this mutant allele. This 11-bp deletion mutation caused a change in the reading frame and the mature E1 beta protein was defective. These observations show the biological importance of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the enzyme activity. The absence of the E1 beta subunit results in instability of the E1 alpha subunit. 
Eosinophilia myalgia syndrome: I. Immunocytochemical evidence for a T-cell-mediated immune effector response. Specimens of muscle and fascia from 13 patients fulfilling the Centers for Disease Control criteria for the eosinophilia myalgia syndrome (EMS) were studied by quantitative immunocytochemical analysis. The immunolocalization of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD22, and CD56 markers, the gamma delta T-cell receptor, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I complex and class II antigens, and complement membrane attack complex (MAC) were examined. The distribution and relative proportions of T cells and T-cell subsets, B cells, macrophages, and eosinophils were determined at perivascular, perimysial, endomysial, and fascial sites of accumulation. At all sites, T cells were predominant, CD8+ cells outnumbered CD4+ cells 6- to 20-fold, and between 60 and 80% of T cells were activated. B cells and eosinophils each accounted for less than 3% of inflammatory cells. Very few cells expressed either the gamma delta T-cell receptor or natural killer cell markers. As in dermatomyositis (DM), MHC class I antigen complex expression was increased on many structurally normal muscle fibers, but in contrast to DM, microvascular MAC deposits were not a feature of EMS. The findings implicate a cellular immune response directed against a connective tissue component in EMS. 
The expression of epidermal growth factor receptor on human bladder cancer: potential use in radioimmunoscintigraphy. Monoclonal antibody 425, which binds to an extracellular domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor, was used to evaluate the expression of this antigen on bladder cancer cells. Epidermal growth factor receptor was found on all bladder cancer cell lines tested. Immunoperoxidase staining of fourteen invasive human bladder cancers with monoclonal antibody 425 demonstrated that ten showed strong staining, one showed weak staining and three were negative. Five noninvasive tumors were similarly examined. Four of these were negative and one showed weak staining. Biodistribution experiments with human bladder tumor xenografts in athymic nude mice using radiolabeled monoclonal antibody 425 and an isotype matched control antibody demonstrated specific tumor localization at five and seven days following antibody injection. Successful imaging of a human bladder tumor xenograft was achieved five days post antibody injection. These data confirm that epidermal growth factor receptor expression correlates with bladder cancer stage and suggests that epidermal growth factor receptor may serve as a target antigen for radioimmunoscintigraphy. 
A quantitative histopathological study of right bundle branch block complicating acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether necrosis of the right bundle branch is responsible for development of right bundle branch block in acute myocardial infarction. Twenty patients with acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction were studied--10 with right bundle branch block (group A) and 10 without (group B)--to evaluate by serial sectioning the pathological extent of myocardial infarction surrounding the right bundle branch and also that of right bundle branch necrosis. Myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch more than 8 mm above the moderator band in all of group A, whereas myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch less than 3 mm above the moderator band in only three patients in group B. Nine hearts in group A showed significant necrosis of the right bundle branch. In group B and in one case with transient right bundle branch block no necrosis was found. The occurrence of right bundle branch block was almost entirely explained by necrosis of the right bundle branch, but transient right bundle branch block did develop without necrosis of the right bundle branch. 
The role of hospital delivery systems in the treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction: rural hospital setting. Discussions on the use of thrombolytic therapy include when is the best time for administration, where is the best place for administration, and who is the most appropriate to begin the administration. Rapid triage and intervention for patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction are special challenges in rural communities. To evaluate the possibility of instituting rapid, "golden hour" treatment for the patient with acute myocardial infarction, rural health care resources must be reviewed. Changes in the health care environment and access to emergent care for the patient with acute myocardial infarction directly affect any treatment. Timely interventions depend on available personnel, appropriate clinical protocols, and regional network systems. 
Antibodies against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes: presence in alcoholic, non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects. Several studies have recently shown the presence of antibodies against acetaldehyde-modifications in the sera of alcoholic patients. To assess the specificity of this immune response, plasma immunoreactivity with proteins modified in vitro by acetaldehyde was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 97 alcoholic patients with varying degrees of alcoholic liver disease, in 35 patients with non-alcoholic liver diseases and in 33 control subjects who were social drinkers. All three groups showed some response against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes. The highest plasma reactivities were found in alcoholics, especially those with steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis. Plasma from patients with non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects also reacted with the acetaldehyde conjugates, but to a lesser extent than plasma from alcoholics. The reliability of these antibodies as markers of either alcohol abuse or alcoholic liver disease therefore appears to be low. However, further studies using more precisely modified proteins or elucidation of the classes of immunoglobulin involved in the immune response against the modified proteins may give clearer differences between the three groups. 
Endoscopic laser therapy for obstructing tracheobronchial lesions. The Lahey Clinic experience using laser bronchoscopy for relief of obstructive tracheobronchial lesions during a 7-year period from 1982 to 1989 involves 269 patients treated with 400 procedures. The carbon dioxide (CO2) laser was used for tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue. The neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used for all obstructing endobronchial neoplasms. Indications for therapy included severe dyspnea, hemoptysis, and postobstructive pneumonitis. All patients had relatively central lesions. A rigid bronchoscope was used to treat 88% of patients, and 12% of patients were treated with a flexible bronchoscope. One death occurred during the intraoperative period. Eleven deaths occurred within 1 week of therapy and were related to the presence of extensive malignant lesions or to coronary artery disease. Our experience indicates that bronchoscopic application of the CO2 or Nd:YAG laser affords effective palliation for patients with obstructive tracheobronchial lesions. The Nd:YAG laser is recommended for patients with bulky vascular endobronchial neoplasms, and the CO2 laser is best reserved for patients with benign tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue. 
Cause of death in unsuccessful prehospital resuscitation. During 1987-1988, prehospital resuscitation was unsuccessful in 204 of 381 patients who suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest due to presumed coronary heart disease in Helsinki. The cause of death was verified by autopsy in 80 (39%) of the 204 patients. Their cause of death could not be estimated on the basis of previous patient history, and their autopsy diagnoses were then related to the initial cardiac rhythm recorded at the scene. At autopsy, coronary heart disease was considered to have been the cause of death in 78% of the patients with ventricular fibrillation, in 43% of the patients with electromechanical dissociation (EMD), and in 60% of the patients in asystole. Cardiac tamponade or massive pulmonary embolism was the cause of death in 15 of the 28 patients with EMD who underwent autopsy. These findings support previously noted relationships between some causes of cardiac arrest and the initial cardiac rhythm, and also in prehospital cardiac arrest patients with unsuccessful resuscitation. 
Evidence from cadavers suggestive of entrapment of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by lumbosacral ligaments. Lumbosacral spines from 51 geriatric-age cadavers (25 men and 26 women) were examined both grossly and under the dissecting microscope for evidence of compression of fifth lumbar spinal nerves by their respective lumbosacral ligaments. These ligaments were found to extend from the transverse process and body of L5 to the ala of the sacrum in 97% of the specimens, and from the transverse process and body of L5 to the promontory of the sacrum in 3% of the specimens. Anterior primary rami of the fifth lumbar spinal nerve were observed to be compressed in 11% (11 of 102) of the specimens examined grossly and under the dissecting microscope. Histologic evidence of chronic compression, as suggested by perineurial and endoneurial fibrosis, peripheral thinning of myelin sheaths, or subjective evidence of a shift in fiber diameter to a population of smaller size fibers was found, deep to the lumbosacral ligament, in three of the 11 nerves judged to be compressed. The information derived is of interest to the clinician whose patient presents with L5 root signs and a myelogram, discogram, and computed tomographic scan which do not show any abnormality. The possibility of extraforaminal compression must be considered as a possible source of the clinical signs. 
MR evaluation of CNS tumors: dose comparison study with gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol. In phase II and III trials of gadoteridol (Gd-HP-D03A), a new nonionic, low-osmolar contrast agent, 40 patients with intracranial neoplasms underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with experimental doses of 0.05-0.3 mmol/kg. Fifteen patients also underwent contrast studies with the standard dose (0.1 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Both gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol appear to have a similar effect when given in equal doses (0.1 mmol/kg, n = 5). Lesion enhancement and delineation were better at higher experimental doses (0.2 or 0.3 mmol/kg, n = 7) and worse at a lower experimental dose (0.05 mmol/kg, n = 3). Quantitative analysis of 10 lesions examined with identical imaging protocols revealed a directly proportional relationship (r = .975) between lesion contrast ratio and dose over a range of 0.05-0.3 mmol/kg. Phantom experiments support the clinical results. Improved enhancement, detection, and delineation of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms resulting from increased injected doses of gadoteridol have the potential to be clinically significant and may justify the possibly higher cost of increased contrast material dosage. Lower doses may not be adequate for the evaluation of most CNS tumors. 
Importance of the renin-angiotensin system in sodium regulation in essential hypertension. To elucidate the effect of natriuretic and antinatriuretic factors on the excretion of an intravenous sodium load, we observed the natriuretic responses of 12 patients with essential hypertension (EHT) and 7 age- and sex-matched normotensive (NT) subjects following the intravenous administration of 1500 mL of normal saline over a 3 h period. After saline infusion, both groups showed increases in urinary sodium excretion (UNaV). The increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and urinary dopamine excretion (UDAV) and the suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) were similar in both groups. However, no significant change in blood pressure (BP) was seen in either group. Since significant negative linear correlations between the basal level of PRA and percent change in UNaV or GFR were seen only in EHT, we observed the influence of suppressing the renin-angiotensin system with a converting enzyme inhibitor. After a 7 day treatment with enalapril, GFR and UNaV in EHT after saline infusion were comparable to data obtained in the absence of enalapril, despite a reduction in preexpansion BP. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation between the basal BP and the percent increase in UNaV was seen among EHT after enalapril treatment. These results suggest that the state of the renin-angiotensin system is important in renal sodium excretion in EHT. 
Mechanisms of otitis media development. Involvement of neurogenic inflammation. The mucosal lining of the middle ear cavity, in particular that of the tympanic membrane and its pars flaccida, exhibits a number of sensory nerves containing the neuropeptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The mucosa is not only rich in nerves and blood vessels but also contains numerous mast cells. It is possible that interactions between histamine-containing mast cells and SP-containing and CGRP-containing nerves--neurogenic inflammation--is one of the mechanisms involved in vessel permeability changes in otitis media with effusion. 
Telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma of the extremities. Results in 17 patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Seventeen patients with telangiectatic osteogenic sarcoma (TOS) of the extremities were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, according to two different protocols. Preoperatively, the patients received high-dose methotrexate (HD-MTX) and cisplatinum (CPD) (HD-MTX/CPD) and doxorubicin. CPD was delivered intraarterially, the other drugs intravenously. Limb-salvage surgery was performed in 12 instances, and five patients were treated with amputation. Postoperative chemotherapy was tailored according to the grade of chemotherapy-induced necrosis. In 13 cases (86%), the resultant grade of necrosis was greater than 90% (good responders). The mean follow-up interval was 3.5 years with a range of 18 to 78 months. Fourteen patients (82%) remained continuously disease-free, while three patients developed lung metastases. Two of these died because of uncontrolled disease, whereas the third patient is alive and disease-free after metastasectomy. No local recurrences were observed. These results are better than those observed in 215 contemporary cases of conventional osteosarcoma treated with the same protocols. This study confirms that TOS is not a uniformly lethal tumor as suggested by prior reports. By employing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a high percentage of patients with TOS can be cured, and in most of them, a limb-sparing surgery is possible and safe. 
Clinical features of 31 patients with Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma Thirty-one patients were diagnosed by morphologic and immunophenotypic features as having primary Ki-1 anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (Ki-1 ALCL). the median age was 35 years (range, 4 months to 78 years); the male:female ratio was 18:13. B symptoms were observed in 13 patients. Peripheral adenopathy was present in 26 patients, while mediastinal adenopathy occurred in five. There was extranodal disease in 13 patients; the most common extranodal site was skin with seven affected. Seventeen patients had stage III/IV disease. Immunophenotypes were T cell in 24 patients and B cell in four patients; immunophenotype could not be determined in three patients. Cytogenetic abnormalities in chromosomes 2, 5, and 7 were detected in three patients. Although therapy was heterogeneous, the actuarial 2-year survival was 73%. Two-year disease-free survival was 39% for all patients; for stages I and II, it was 62% compared with 20% for stages III and IV (P = .001). Complete remission (CR) occurred in 21 of 23 patients receiving combination chemotherapy; however, nine relapses, including six of seven stage IV patients, occurred within 21 months of diagnosis. Preliminary observations suggest that Ki-1 ALCL may have a quiescent phase in the rare patient with only localized skin disease. However, the disease generally behaves as an intermediate- to high-grade lymphoma, and patients with Ki-1 ALCL should receive curative-intent combination chemotherapy. 
Renal vascular response to sodium loading in sons of hypertensive parents. Studies of normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents offer the potential to identify inherited abnormalities that contribute to essential hypertension. We compared renal and systemic hemodynamic responses to saline infusion between normotensive sons of two hypertensive parents (SOHT) and sons of two normotensive parents (SONT) selected from the general population of Rochester, Minn. Hemodynamic measurements were performed after a week of low sodium intake (10 meq/day) and were repeated after a week of high sodium intake (200 meq/day). Despite being in the normotensive range, blood pressures in SOHT were higher than those in SONT during low sodium (124 +/- 3/85 +/- 3 versus 118 +/- 2/71 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) and high sodium (122 +/- 3/80 +/- 3 versus 112 +/- 2/70 +/- 2 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) conditions. Higher pressures in SOHT were associated with elevated systemic and renal vascular resistance. After a high sodium diet, renal vascular resistance in SOHT rose further during acute saline infusion, whereas systemic vascular resistance did not change. After a low sodium diet, this renal vasoconstrictor response to saline infusion in SOHT was not present, and renal vascular resistance fell to levels not different from SONT. Plasma renin activity, aldosterone, and atrial natriuretic peptide did not differ between SONT and SOHT. Circulating levels of norepinephrine were higher in SOHT. These data demonstrate a renal vasoconstrictor response to saline infusion in normotensive SOHT, which depends on prior sodium intake. This alteration in renal hemodynamics may represent an inherited abnormality related to the development of hypertension. 
Solitary polyclonal autonomous thyroid nodule: a rare cause of childhood hyperthyroidism. Solitary autonomous thyroid tumors are an unusual cause of hyperthyroidism, particularly in childhood. We describe the youngest individual so far reported with this condition, a 22 month child with a large hyperfunctioning thyroid nodule who became overtly hyperthyroid after iodinated contrast administration. The histology of the nodule was compatible with follicular cell hyperplasia. These tumors are often called toxic adenomas, although there is no solid evidence that they are true neoplasms. We examined the clonal composition of the child's thyroid tumor by X-chromosome inactivation analysis, taking advantage of a polymorphism in the X-chromosome gene phosphoglycerate kinase. The tumor consisted of an even mixture of cells containing activated paternal and maternal PGK alleles, indicating that the tumor was polyclonal. Furthermore, the nodule had no structural rearrangements or activating point mutations of ras oncogenes, which are found in up to 50% of solitary monoclonal follicular adenomas. Solitary hot nodules may at least in some cases be secondary to hyperplasia, and not to clonal expansion of an abnormal, mutated cell. This may also explain the relatively low frequency of malignant transformation observed in hyperfunctioning thyroid tumors. 
Temperature and total white blood cell count as indicators of bacteremia. This study was designed to quantify more precisely the accuracy of magnitude of rectal temperature and total white blood cell (WBC) count as indicators of bacteremia in children with an obvious focal bacterial infection. A total of 955 children, aged 3 to 36 months, who had rectal temperature greater than or equal to 39.0 degrees C and were seeking care at either of two urban pediatric emergency departments had blood drawn for culture; 885 had blood drawn for WBC count. Twenty-seven had bacteremia. Various combinations of temperature and WBC count were selected to construct receiver-operating-characteristic curves by plotting sensitivity vs false-positive rate (1 - specificity). The receiver-operating-characteristic curve of WBC count provided significantly better diagnostic information than the curve for temperature increments above 39.0 degrees C. Each increment of 0.5 degrees C led to large decrements in sensitivity and false-positive rates. At a WBC count cutoff of 10,000/mm3, the sensitivity was 92% while the false-positive rate was 57%. Using this cutoff point, the clinician could have avoided performing 368 of 955 blood cultures and missed only 2 of 26 children with bacteremia. Receiver-operating-characteristic curves combining WBC count and temperature increments above 39.0 degrees C provided no better diagnostic information than that of WBC count at a temperature cutoff of 39.0 degrees C. It is concluded that increments in temperature above 39.0 degrees C provided additional diagnostic specificity for bacteremia only at the expense of unacceptable decreases in sensitivity. Total WBC count provided better information. A WBC count cutoff of 10,000/mm3 increased specificity with minimal decrease in sensitivity. 
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. Fatal progression of pulmonary hypertension despite steroid-induced remission of interstitial pneumonitis. This report describes a 28-yr-old patient with pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD). She presented with pulmonary hypertension, hypoxemia, and interstitial pneumonitis. We report the discordance between the response of her hypoxemia and interstitial pneumonitis, which resolved with corticosteroid therapy, and her progressive pulmonary hypertension, which caused fatal right heart failure. This report emphasizes that the radiographic interstitial shadowing of PVOD may be caused by either (1) an inflammatory interstitial pneumonitis (which may be responsive to anti-inflammatory therapy) or (2) interstitial pulmonary edema, or both. 
Low-dose isradipine once daily effectively controls 24-h blood pressure in essential hypertension. In one study of 10 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, equivalent total daily doses (13 +/- 2 mg) of isradipine given twice daily and a modified-release formulation of isradipine (isradipine MR) given once daily were found to control adequately 24 h ambulatory blood pressure compared with placebo (P less than .001 for each v placebo). In another study of 22 patients with essential hypertension, 5 and 10 mg isradipine MR once daily has been shown to reduce the average 24 h blood pressure by 11 +/- 1/6 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than .001) and 13 +/- 2/9 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than .001), respectively, compared with placebo. There was no loss of efficacy with isradipine MR during the 24 h observation period with either dose. In conclusion, low-dose isradipine MR once daily is an effective first-line treatment in essential hypertension. 
Pediatric endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed 42 times in 38 patients aged 14 months to 20 yr at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh from 1982 to 1990. The adult side-viewing duodenoscope, Olympus JF1T, was used for all procedures. Intravenous sedation was used in 68% of the patients, whereas general anesthesia was employed in the remainder. Visualization of the appropriate ductal system was accomplished in 35 patients (92%). No therapeutic maneuvers were performed at endoscopy. Eleven of the 22 patients with ductal abnormalities underwent surgical treatment, based on the ERCP findings. The only complication encountered was mild pancreatitis in three patients (8%), all with a history of pancreatitis. We conclude that ERCP is a safe, useful procedure in the evaluation of children with pancreaticobiliary disorders, and in the identification of surgically correctable lesions in 29% of those patients. 
Venous emboli occurring caesarean section: the effect of patient position. The effect of position, horizontal versus 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg's, on the incidence of venous emboli during Caesarean section was evaluated in 207 patients. Venous emboli were diagnosed using precordial ultrasonic Doppler monitoring. In the horizontal position, 44% (60 of 134) parturients had venous emboli compared with 1% (1 of 73) parturients in the 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg's position (P less than 0.0001). Epidural anaesthesia was performed in 171 patients, and 36 patients had general anaesthesia. In the epidural group, pulse oximetric haemoglobin oxygen desaturation and complaints of chest pain and/or dyspnoea were associated with the venous emboli. Venous emboli, probably air, occur frequently during Caesarean section with the patient in the horizontal position. This occurrence was minimized by placing the patient in the 5 degrees reverse Trendelenburg's position. 
Recognizing early Parkinson's disease. Differential diagnosis of Parkinson's disease should cover not only the classic disorder described by James Parkinson in 1817 (paralysis agitans) but also numerous other idiopathic and secondary disorders that have varying degrees of parkinsonian features. Because treatment options can vary greatly among mimicking disorders and differ from those effective for Parkinson's disease, a prompt, accurate diagnosis is essential. Physicians can distinguish between these often-overlapping disorders by differentiating primary from secondary parkinsonism and by classifying primary syndromes into disorders with prominent tremor and those without. 
Spontaneous haematomyelia: a necropsy study. Spontaneous haematomyelia (intramedullary spinal haematoma), is an uncommon event. Predisposing conditions have been reported including syringomyelia, pregnancy and delivery, angioma, spinal artery aneurysm, and haemophilia, but only rarely has a pathological evaluation been performed. Two such cases studied at necropsy are reported. In one case, the haematoma was restricted to the cervical spinal cord, while in the second case it extended from the medulla into the lowest thoracic cord segments. In both cases the haematomyelia was fatal. In the first case the clinical course was subacute, but in the other the course was more acute. Careful neuropathological examination showed no apparent cause for the haemorrhages. 
An in vivo model of experimental arterial stenosis, intimal damage, and periodic thrombosis. Coronary artery bypass grafts, angioplasty, and thrombolysis are beneficial procedures for patients with coronary artery disease. However, these procedures can fail by mechanisms related to interactions between platelets and the damaged arterial wall. An experimental model for studying some of the mechanisms of platelet interaction with endothelial- and medial-damaged stenosed arteries is described. Dogs or pigs are anesthetized, and the chest opened. The heart is exposed, the circumflex or left anterior descending coronary artery is dissected out, and an EMF or Doppler flow probe is placed on it. Distal to the flow probe, the artery is clamped with a vascular clamp to produce endothelial and/or medial injury. Then, an encircling plastic cylinder is placed around the outside of the injured artery, producing a "critical stenosis." Acute platelet thrombus formation begins to occur in the stenosed lumen, gradually increasing the amount of stenosis. This causes the coronary flow to decline and reach zero flow when the artery is completely occluded. Then, the thrombus is embolized into the distal circulation, and flow is restored to normal levels. This occurs repeatedly causing cyclic flow reductions (CFRs). These CFRs can be made larger and to occur more frequently by increasing in vivo platelet activity, by raising the plasma catecholamine levels, or by increasing the collagen exposed in the stenosed lumen by increased medial damage. If an effective dose of an antiplatelet agent is given, the CFRs will be decreased in size and frequency or abolished entirely. Aspirin and other agents abolish the CFRs in this model; however, CFRs can be renewed by infusions of catecholamines or platelet activating factor. Thus, the model may be useful for studying mechanisms that enhance or inhibit arterial thrombosis in stenosed arteries with endothelial and medial injury. 
Characterization of recombinant factor VIII and a recombinant factor VIII deletion mutant using a rabbit immunogenicity model system. The use of factor VIII prepared genetically engineered cell lines (rFVIII) may avoid some of the problems inherently associated with administering plasma-derived factor VIII (pdFVIII) concentrates to hemophilia A patients. Although rFVIII may represent an improvement over traditional therapeutics, the chance exists that protein production in cell culture may result in the presence of novel epitopes that may enhance the formation of inhibitor antibodies capable of neutralizing either rFVIII or pdFVIII. To assess the differences between rFVIII and its plasma-derived homologue, a rabbit immunogenicity model system was developed. Antibodies raised to rFVIII in rabbits were tested for the presence of antibodies capable of binding rFVIII but not pdFVIII, the presence of which would suggest that novel epitope(s) were present. This analysis was performed using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, as well as immunoadsorption. For either technique, rFVIII-specific antibodies were not detected, indicating that differences between rFVIII and pdFVIII were not found. When a rFVIII B-region deletion mutant was similarly tested, antibodies specific for this protein were found. These specific antibodies appeared to bind in the vicinity of the deletion site and their binding was not affected by carbohydrate removal. These results indicate that the rabbit immunogenicity model system is sensitive to alterations in the factor VIII molecule and suggest that full-length rFVIII will not be any more immunogenic in human patients than pdFVIII. 
Thrombin and parathyroid hormone mobilize intracellular calcium in rat osteosarcoma cells by distinct pathways. The mechanisms by which PTH and thrombin mobilize intracellular Ca2+ (Cai2+) were examined in UMR 106-H5 rat osteosarcoma cells. Bovine PTH-(1-34) (24 pM to 240 nM) produced a dose-dependent increase in Cai2+ (EC50, 3 nM), which returned to baseline within 75 sec. Human alpha-thrombin produced an increase in Cai2+ (ECmax, 10 U/ml) which was similar to that of PTH with respect to both magnitude and time course. Chelation of extracellular calcium with 5.0 mM EGTA did not alter the Cai2+ response to either PTH or thrombin. When added together at maximally effective concentrations, PTH and thrombin produced additive effects on Cai2+ in the presence and absence of EGTA. The additive effects of PTH and thrombin on Cai2+ were confirmed at the single cell level, using laser-based image analysis. Bradykinin (1 microM) produced a significant increase in Cai2+ in UMR 106-H5 cells which was of lesser magnitude than the peak 2- to 3-fold increase elicited by PTH or thrombin. Preexposure of cells to 10 U/ml thrombin for 2 min abolished the Cai2+ response to bradykinin, whereas preexposure to 240 nM PTH had no effect on the Cai2+ response to bradykinin. Thrombin elicited a rapid increase in the accumulation of 3H-labeled inositol phosphates (IP2 and IP3) in UMR 106-H5 cells, with increases in [3H]1,4,5-IP3 detectable as early as 15 sec after the addition of thrombin. Bradykinin increased [3H]IP production to a lesser extent than thrombin, whereas PTH neither increased [3H]IP accumulation nor potentiated the [3H]IP response to thrombin. The results suggest that thrombin and bradykinin mobilize Cai2+ from a shared IP3-responsive calcium pool, whereas PTH may use signals in addition to 1,4,5-IP3 to mobilize calcium from a distinct cellular calcium pool. Alternatively, specific calcium compartmentalization exists, and there is differential coupling of these agonists to the 1,4,5-IP3/Cai2+ pathway. 
Disturbed secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with persistent atrial standstill: endocrinologic silence. Persistent atrial standstill is a very rare pathophysiologic condition whose diagnosis is established when both electrical and mechanical silence of the atria are confirmed. To test the hypothesis that secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide is disturbed in patients with persistent atrial standstill, the response of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and other neurohormonal factors during exercise was investigated in three patients with a rate-responsive ventricular demand (VVI) pacemaker implanted for confirmed persistent atrial standstill. The results were compared with those observed in eight normal subjects and patients with a rate-responsive VVI (Group A) or atrial demand (AAI) (Group B) pacemaker implanted for confirmed sick sinus syndrome. Patients in Group A displayed significant elevation of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide secretion both before and during exercise (122.5 +/- 14.8 and 207.5 +/- 8.3 pg/ml, respectively) compared with those in Group B (55 +/- 14.1 and 116.4 +/- 51.5 pg/ml, respectively) and the normal subjects (18.9 +/- 9.8 and 30.8 +/- 19.2 pg/ml, respectively). This indicated development of a nonphysiologic increase in atrial volume or pressure overload, or both, in rate-responsive VVI pacing because of lack of atrioventricular synchrony. However, patients with persistent atrial standstill had undetectable (less than 10 pg/ml) or almost undetectable secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide as well as lower levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the circulation both before and during exercise. Changes in plasma catecholamines during exercise were similar in patients with persistent atrial standstill compared with the other groups. This study indicates that "endocrinologic silence" accompanies electrical and mechanical silence of the atria, which may constitute a third diagnostic clue to persistent atrial standstill. 
Kinetics of Borrelia burgdorferi dissemination and evolution of disease after intradermal inoculation of mice. Borrelia burgdorferi dissemination to selected target organs was examined on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 15, 21, and 30 after intradermal inoculation of 4-week-old C3H mice. Infection was determined by culture (blood, spleen, kidney, ear punch); polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for outer surface protein A (OSP A) DNA (ear punch); histology and spirochete histochemistry (spleen, kidney, skin, heart, joints); and OSP A DNA in situ hybridization (joints, heart). Blood or spleen of most mice were culture positive by day 3 and ear punch by day 10. Polymerase chain reaction performed on ear punches was also positive by day 10. Inflammation of joints and tendons began on days 4 through 7 and heart on days 7 through 10, which coincided with colonization of tissues with spirochetes. Spirochetes were multifocal in distribution, with a predilection for collagenous connective tissue of joints, heart, arteries, nerves, muscle, skin, and other tissues. Relative numbers of spirochetes peaked at 15 days, then decreased by 21 days. Gamma M immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody was detectable on immunoblots as early as day 4, with subsequent declining reactivity, and IgG antibody was detectable by day 7, with expanding reactivity to multiple antigens through day 30. 
Efficacy and toxicity of thromboxane synthetase inhibitor for cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. The efficacy and possible side effects of thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthetase inhibitor in the treatment of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) were assessed for 24 patients who presented with grades I to IV of the Hunt and Hess classification. All patients underwent aneurysmal clipping within 48 hours after SAH. Postoperatively, TXA2 synthetase inhibitor, Cataclot [sodium (E)-3-[p-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)phenyl]-2-propenoate] was administered to 13 patients by continuous drip infusion at a dose of 1 microgram/kg/min for 8 to 14 days (group A). The remaining 11 patients did not receive this drug (group B). Of the 13 patients in group A, seven patients (54%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm after SAH. Four patients (31%) developed a transient deterioration of consciousness and/or motor disturbance. Three of these patients fully recovered, while one of them showed a mild neurological deficit on discharge. One patient (8%) developed permanent dysphasia and hemiparesis as a result of ischemic brain damage due to vasospasm. One patient (8%) died of the side effect. On the other hand, of the 11 patients in group B, only three (27%) showed no symptomatic vasospasm. One (9%) patient presented a transient neurological deficit but fully recovered upon discharge. Four patients (36%) showed permanent neurological deficits, although they all could lead an independent life after discharge. The three remaining patients developed a severe disturbance of consciousness caused by ischemia due to vasospasm, and two of them died within 1 month after the onset of SAH. In the group treated with Cataclot, two patients developed an epidural hematoma late during the administration of the drug. Of these two, one patient died of increased intracranial pressure that was accelerated by the complication. These results indicate that TXA2 synthetase inhibitor is effective in not only decreasing the occurrence of symptomatic vasospasm but also reducing the neurological deterioration due to vasospasm after SAH. However, this drug has a hazardous side effect in that it may promote a tendency to bleed, which caused death in one of our patients. 
Constrictive pericarditis masquerading as Budd-Chiari syndrome. Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) and constrictive pericarditis (CP) share many common clinical features. Over the last year we encountered three patients in whom CP clinically mimicked BCS. Two of the three did not even have raised jugular venous pressure. One patient with severe jaundice and hepatic coma ultimately died. Liver biopsy features were not discriminating. The final diagnosis of CP was established by echocardiography, chest computed tomography (CT), or cardiac catheterization. We conclude that in all patients with apparent BCS and atypical features, a noninvasive test like echocardiography or chest CT should be done to rule out treatable illness like CP before embarking on such invasive procedures as liver biopsy for diagnosis. 
Calcium and carcinogenesis of the mammary gland. Effects of dietary calcium on mammary carcinogenesis in rats were investigated because of evidence that calcium counteracts the promotion of colon cancer by dietary fat and because experimental diets for rats normally contain higher amounts of calcium and vitamin D than do human diets. Our earlier experiments indicated that yields of tumors induced in young, Sprague-Dawley rats by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene (DMBA) were higher when dietary calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D were decreased. Results of an experiment in which dietary amounts of calcium, phosphate, and vitamin D were varied independently suggested that phosphate and vitamin D have interactive effects with calcium. Another experiment in which dietary vitamin D alone was varied provided evidence that higher amounts inhibited tumorigenesis in the presence of low amounts of calcium and phosphate but the results with a high-calcium and -phosphate diet were inconclusive. The findings suggest that low amounts of dietary calcium and vitamin D and high amounts of phosphate increase susceptibility to DMBA-induced mammary neoplasia. 
Human beta-galactosidase gene mutations in GM1-gangliosidosis: a common mutation among Japanese adult/chronic cases. Molecular analysis of the human beta-galactosidase gene revealed six different mutations in 10 of 11 Japanese GM1-gangliosidosis patients. They were the only abnormalities in each allele examined in this study. A 165-nucleotide duplication (positions 1103-1267) was found in two infantile patients, producing an abnormally large mRNA; one patient was probably a homozygote, and the other was a heterozygote of this mutation. The other two infantile patients had different mutations; a 123 Gly(GGG)----Arg(AGG) mutation in one patient and a 316 Tyr(TAT)----Cys(TGT) mutation in the other. A 201 Arg(CGC)----Cys(TGC) mutation, eliminating a BspMI site, was detected in a late-infantile/juvenile patient; the restriction-site analysis of amplified genomic DNA confirmed his heterozygosity for this mutation. A 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation was found in all five adult/chronic patients examined in this study. It created a SauI site, and restriction-site analysis confirmed that four patients were homozygous mutants. The other was a compound heterozygote for this mutation and another 457 Arg(CGA)----Gln(CAA) mutation. These mutant genes expressed markedly decreased or completely deficient enzyme activities in beta-galactosidase-deficient human fibroblasts transformed by adenovirus-SV40 recombinants. We conclude that gene mutations are heterogeneous in GM1-gangliosidosis but that the 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation is common among the Japanese adult/chronic cases. Genotype-phenotype correlations in GM1-gangliosidosis are briefly discussed. 
Short- and long-term psychological status following stroke. Short form MMPI results. Indices of self-reported depression and psychological adjustment after stroke were evaluated using a short form of the MMPI. Patients with poststroke periods of 2 to 6 and 7 to 24 months were selected, and indices of general intellectual functioning and lesion size/location were obtained. Despite similar levels of intellectual functioning and lesion parameters, the longer duration group showed significantly higher depression scores and significant (T greater than 70) elevations on several other clinical scales of the MMPI. In contrast, the mean overall profile of the short-duration group was roughly within normal limits. These findings have implications for the clinical assessment and treatment of stroke patients and long-term psychological adjustment after stroke. 
Perioperative stroke. Part I: General surgery, carotid artery disease, and carotid endarterectomy. Although stroke, defined as a focal neurological deficit lasting more than 24 hr, is uncommon in the perioperative period, its associated mortality and long-term disability are high. No large-scale data are available to identify the importance of recognized risk factors for stroke in the perioperative period. A review of the literature shows that the incidence and mechanism of its occurrence are influenced by the presence of cardiovascular disease and the type of surgery. The most common cause of perioperative stroke is embolism. In non-cardiac surgery, the incidence of perioperative stroke is higher among the elderly. Properly administered, controlled hypotension is associated with minimal risk of stroke. Cerebral vasospasm may be the cause of focal cerebral ischaemia in eclamptic patients, and the aggressive treatment of hypertension may exacerbate the neurological damage. The risk of stroke associated with carotid endarterectomy is closely related to the preoperative neurological presentation, and the experience of the surgical/anaesthetic team. Symptomatic cerebrovascular disease, acute stroke, asymptomatic carotid lesions, preoperative assessment of risk, local and general anaesthesia, cerebral protection and monitoring during carotid endarterectomy are discussed with reference to reducing the risk of perioperative stroke. Adequate monitoring and protection have minimized the risk of ischaemia from carotid clamping, and the major mechanism of stroke is embolization. 
Protein status and metabolic expenditure determine the response to intravenous nutrition--a new classification of surgical malnutrition. To determine whether nutritional and metabolic factors affect the response to intravenous nutrition (IVN) 146 surgical patients were classified according to their protein and metabolic status using direct measurements of body protein and metabolic expenditure. The patients were grouped into four categories: category I, moderate to severe protein depletion without raised metabolic expenditure; category II, moderate to severe protein depletion with raised metabolic expenditure; category III, mild protein depletion without raised metabolic expenditure; and category IV, mild protein depletion with raised metabolic expenditure. After 2 weeks of IVN patients in category I gained a mean(s.e.m.) of 0.43(0.06) kg of body protein (P less than 0.001) and had significant rises in both plasma transferrin and prealbumin (P less than 0.05); patients in category II gained 0.30(0.11) kg of protein (P less than 0.005) and also had significant rises in transferrin and prealbumin (P less than 0.05). Patients in category III lost 0.24(0.11) kg protein (P less than 0.05) and had no changes in either transferrin or prealbumin and patients in category IV lost 0.51(0.13) kg of body protein (P less than 0.001) and although there was a significant rise in plasma prealbumin there was no significant change in plasma transferrin. When postoperative patients were examined separately, they did not differ significantly from preoperative patients except in category I, where their protein gain was only 0.19(0.10) kg, an amount not significantly different from that gained by patients in category II. In each of the four categories described, the changes in total body protein occurring with 2 weeks of IVN were determined by the relative effects of two competing processes; protein depletion and raised metabolic expenditure. With moderate to severe protein depletion (approximately 30 per cent depletion of body protein stores) there was a marked tendency to gain protein with IVN. When the patient had a raised metabolic expenditure or was postoperative this tendency of depleted patients to gain protein was still present but it was less. With only mild protein depletion (approximately 10 per cent depletion) increases in metabolic expenditure made it difficult, if not impossible, to prevent continuing protein loss in spite of aggressive nutritional support. The patient categories we have described determine the response to IVN and form the basis of a new clinical classification of surgical malnutrition. 
Malignancy and chronic wounds: Marjolin's ulcer. Malignancy in chronic wounds is not uncommon and has been reported as occurring in chronic scars of diverse causes. We report an unusual case of bilateral thermal injuries of the lower extremities that 40 years later presented as very large, painful, fungating wounds of both lower legs. After histologic confirmation of squamous cell carcinoma, eradication of the disease required amputations of both the lower extremities and reconstructive procedures. In addition, we discuss current theories regarding the mechanism of malignant degeneration in chronic wounds and evaluate treatment on the basis of information currently available in the literature. 
Endoscopic sphincterotomy: the whole truth. An 8 year experience of 602 patients (median age 76 years) referred for endoscopic management of common bile stones is reported. No patient referred for treatment has been excluded. A diagnostic cholangiogram was achieved in 94 per cent and sphincterotomy was accomplished in 91.5 per cent. The bile ducts were demonstrated to be completely cleared of stones in 491 (81.6 per cent) of 602 patients. A mean number of 1.9 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography examinations per patient were necessary to achieve this result. Complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy, which were strictly defined, occurred in 10.5 per cent of patients although five patients had two complications (total complication rate 11.3 per cent). The 30-day mortality rate was 2.2 per cent, seven of 13 deaths (1.2 per cent) occurring as a direct result of sphincterotomy. There have been statistically significant improvements in bile duct clearance and complication rates with increasing experience of endoscopists. 
Prolonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents. OBJECTIVES: Previous reports have described prolonged paralysis after treatment with neuromuscular junction blocking agents in critically ill patients. The purpose of this study was to further describe a group of patients who developed prolonged weakness after treatment with these agents. DESIGN: Clinical information, electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology results are described in this group of patients. Clinical information includes diagnoses, dosage of neuromuscular junction blocker, other medications affecting the neuromuscular system, and neuromuscular examination and clinical course. SETTING: All patients were seen in the ICUs of three local hospitals. PATIENTS: Included were critically ill patients with a variety of diagnoses, all of whom developed severe weakness after discontinuation of neuromuscular junction blocking agents. INTERVENTIONS: Electrodiagnostic studies and muscle biopsies were performed on several of the patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All patients had pronounced weakness without sensory loss. Electrodiagnostic and muscle pathology findings were consistent with failed neuromuscular transmission. Although many patients had disorders or were taking medications that can injure the neuromuscular system, no disorder or medication was common to all. Recovery of strength often took several months and most patients were slow to wean from mechanical ventilator support. CONCLUSIONS: Although alternative explanations cannot be excluded with certainty, the use of neuromuscular junction blocking agents may lead to neurogenic atrophy and care must be taken when using them. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen. Morphological, radiological, immunophenotypic, and ultrastructural features. A case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the spleen is described. Its rapid enlargement, demonstrable by ultrasound studies and computed tomographic scan, its gross appearance, and some of its histologic features suggested malignant lymphoma. However, a characteristic circumferential zonal pattern and polytypic immunophenotype helped to establish the correct diagnosis. In retrospect, the zonal pattern was also identified radiologically. 
Regulation of the oncodevelopmental expression of type 1 chain ABH and Lewis(b) blood group antigens in human colon by alpha-2-L-fucosylation. Blood group antigen expression in the distal human colon is related to the development of the organ and is modified by malignant transformation. To elucidate the biochemical basis for these changes, we have (a) analysed the activity of glycosyltransferases coded for by the H, Se, Le, X, and A genes, in tissue biopsy specimens from normal and malignant proximal and distal human colon; (b) characterised the glycosphingolipids expressed in the various regions of normal and malignant colon by immunostaining of high performance thin layer chromatography plates; and (c) located the antigens on tissue sections from the same subjects by immunohistochemistry. In both secretors and non-secretors we found a significantly higher activity of alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases in carcinomatous rectal tissue than in tissue from normal subjects, whereas the other transferase activities studied showed no significant differences. The acceptor substrate specificity suggested that both the Se and the H gene dependent alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases are increased in carcinomas. In non-malignant tissue the only enzyme which showed appreciably higher activity in caecum than in rectum was alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferase. Immunochemistry and immunohistochemistry showed alpha-2-L-fucosylated structures in normal caecum from secretors and in tumour tissue from both secretors and non-secretors. We conclude that the alpha-2-L-fucosyltransferases control the expression of ABH, and Lewis(b) structures in normal and malignant colon. 
Follow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery. A follow-up study of unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 and C4 segments of the internal carotid artery was performed. During the 10-year period from 1979 to 1989, there were 22 patients with 24 aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. All 24 aneurysms were unruptured. They represented 3% of all intracranial aneurysms and 11% of all internal carotid artery aneurysms diagnosed at the hospital during the 10-year period. Eighteen patients were women and 4 were men. Their ages ranged from 34 to 82 years (mean 63.3 years). Of the 22 patients, 12 (55%) had multiple aneurysms. A follow-up study without treatment was made in 15 of the 22 patients who had a total of 16 unruptured aneurysms arising from the C3 or C4 segment of the internal carotid artery. This study excluded 7 of the 22 patients with a total of eight aneurysms because of operation or death soon after diagnosis. The average maximal dimension of the 16 aneurysms was 5 mm, with a range of 2-17 mm. Follow-up periods varied from 11 months to 10.5 years, with an average of 4.7 years. During this period, none of the 16 aneurysms ruptured, and they remained asymptomatic, except for one aneurysm that had been discovered as a result of the cavernous sinus syndrome. Some surgeons are now attempting direct operations on intracavernous carotid artery aneurysms, even if the aneurysms are unruptured and relatively small. 
Abdominal aortic aneurysms complicated by spontaneous iliocaval or duodenal fistulae. Seven hundred and twenty one abdominal aortic aneurysms were treated between 1960 and 1985. Twenty one of these (2.9%) were complicated by the development of a spontaneous primary fistula, 16 (2.2%) into the vena cava or iliac veins and 5 (0.7%) into the duodenum. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only four instances, two aorto-caval and two aorto-duodenal fistulae. Hospital mortality was 44% for aorto-caval and 60% for aorto-duodenal fistulae. Despite the lack of a precise preoperative diagnosis in the majority of cases, the prognosis for aorto-caval fistula remained comparable to that for patients undergoing emergency surgery for uncomplicated ruptured aortic aneurysms. The mortality of spontaneous aorto-duodenal fistulae was appreciably higher and the aneurysmal contents of 4 out of these 5 cases had positive bacterial cultures. 
A case of intracerebral air embolism secondary to the insertion of a Hickman line. Complications following the insertion of intravenous catheters are relatively uncommon. We report a potentially serious, hitherto unrecognized complication of Hickman line insertion, and discuss the condition. 
Isolation and direct characterization of resident microglial cells from the normal and inflamed central nervous system. In addition to the major population of infiltrating leukocytes recovered from inflamed rat central nervous system (CNS), all of which expressed high levels of leukocyte common antigen CD45, many cells were coisolated that were MRC OX42+ (complement receptor 3/CD11b) but expressed low-to-moderate levels of CD45 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules. Most cells from normal CNS, in contrast, lay within this latter, CD45low population. From previous in situ immunohistochemical studies, the fortuitously isolated CD45low cells were probably resident (ramified) microglia. Using irradiation chimeras, we show that resident microglia respond to inflammation by upregulating CD45, CD4, and MHC class I molecules with a minority of these cells increasing their expression of MHC class II molecules. A 3- to 4-fold increase in the number of microglia isolated from inflamed CNS provided indirect evidence that the cells had proliferated. In normal CNS, a very small population of blood-derived CD45high-expressing cells are present; most MHC class II expression is associated with these few cells and not with the resident microglia. 
Grading of human urothelial carcinoma based on nuclear atypia and mitotic frequency. I. Histological description. The World Health Organization (WHO) grade II bladder tumors constitute a clinically and histologically heterogeneous group due to imprecise histological definitions. In an attempt to improve this problem 124 transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder were histologically reviewed using a modified Bergkvist system. The grade II tumors were divided into 2 groups, grades IIa and IIb, mainly with reference to the degree of nuclear atypia and number of mitoses. Using definitions possible to express by numerical means, the separation was easy and reproducible. Due to great histological resemblance between certain close grades we propose a new grading system with 3 grades combining I and IIa (grade A), IIb and III (grade B), and a third group (grade C) for the anaplastic tumors. 
Typical and atypical bronchopulmonary carcinoids. A clinicopathologic and flow cytometric study. The clinicopathologic and flow cytometric characteristics of 47 bronchopulmonary carcinoids were assessed, relative to patient survival. Aneuploidy was associated more often with tumor size of greater than or equal to 3.0 cm (P less than 0.004) and lymph node (P less than 0.013) or vascular involvement (P less than 0.004). Also, an aneuploid DNA content was seen significantly more often in histologically atypical (79%) than in typical carcinoid neoplasms (18%) (P less than 0.0001). Cox proportional hazard model analysis revealed that the histologic category (typical vs. atypical) and ploidy pattern were important prognostic indicators. Size of the primary tumor and the presence of vascular involvement were also significant predictors of outcome. Histologically atypical carcinoids with diploid DNA content pursued a less aggressive course than did their aneuploid counterparts. 
Down's syndrome and mixed acute leukemia in infants. The routine use of panels of monoclonal antibodies has been complementary to the French-American-British (FAB) leukemia classification, and has unmasked the occurrence of mixed acute leukemia (myeloid-lymphoid). It is widely accepted that children with Down's syndrome (DS) have a high incidence of acute leukemia. There is an extensive body of literature emphasizing the cytogenetic findings in these children. However, information as to the immunophenotype is often limited to the lymphoid surface determinants. The authors report two children with DS whose leukemic blasts were studied with a panel of 17 monoclonal antibodies (myeloid, lymphoid, and megakaryocytic) by flow cytometric examination and were classified as biphenotypic acute leukemia. The blast population coexpressed myeloid and T-cell surface markers. The lymphoid origin was ruled out on the basis of negative terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase and molecular analysis demonstrating germline configuration for the JH and beta TCR genes. 
The impact of breast-conserving treatment and mastectomy on the quality of life of early-stage breast cancer patients: a review. In recent years, doubt has been shed on the necessity of mastectomy for women with early-stage breast cancer. Apart from purely medical studies comparing (radical) mastectomy to less intruding surgical treatment, a number of studies (N = 18) have been published investigating the impact of breast-conserving treatment versus mastectomy on quality of life. We review these studies with respect to medical issues (treatment modality, stage of disease), methodologic issues (design, measurement moment, sample size), and results (psychologic discomfort, changes in life patterns, fears and concerns). It is concluded that there is no solid proof of a better psychologic adjustment after breast-conserving treatment and that there are no substantial differences between the different treatment modalities in changes of life patterns and fears and concerns. However, the results with respect to body image and sexual functioning favor the use of breast-conserving treatment. 
Termination of central sleep apnea episodes by upper airway stimulation using intermittent positive pressure ventilation. A 52-year-old man presented with pure central sleep apnea syndrome that failed to respond to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) therapy. Intermittent positive pressure stimulation via a nasal mask was instituted using a portable positive pressure ventilator. We found marked reduction in the respiratory disturbance index, number of desaturations, and the number of arousals with this mode of therapy. 
Prevalence of obesity in a Native Hawaiian population. Mortality data indicate that Native Hawaiians have higher death rates when compared with the US all-races population, and full-blooded Native Hawaiians are likely to have the highest mortality rates from heart disease in the nation. However, to date no comprehensive population-based study of risk factors in Native Hawaiians has been conducted. In this study of 257 Native Hawaiian adults, 62.8% of the women and 65.5% of the men were greater than or equal to 20% overweight by the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II) standards. Thirty-four percent of the women and 47% of the men were severely overweight. The mean body mass index (BMI, in kg/m2) was 30.3 in women and 30.9 in men. Women aged 45-54 y were heaviest with a mean BMI of 31.6. Of the men aged 25-34 y, 79.2% were overweight. The mean waist-to-hip ratio was 0.85 for women and 0.95 for men in this sample. 
Mitomycin C-loaded microcapsules in the treatment of colorectal liver metastases. Pharmacokinetics of regionally administered particulate chemotherapy. Microencapsulated mitomycin C has been used for the treatment of intrahepatic tumors in Japan, but there have been no reports of its use in western countries. In this study, the pharmacokinetic profile of intrahepatic arterial mitomycin C microcapsules is reported. Regional mitomycin C was administered to six patients, both in the microencapsulated form and in solution. The clearance (140 +/- 31 1/hour, mean +/- SD) and half-life of drug in plasma (0.39 +/- 0.03 hours), and volume distribution (246 +/- 23 1) were significantly higher, and peak drug concentrations (80 +/- 75 ng/ml) significantly lower with the microencapsulated preparation than with the free drug (clearance, 46 +/- 8 1/hour; half-life, 0.11 +/- 0.02 hours; volume distribution, 33 +/- 4; peak drug concentration, 812 +/- 423 ng/ml), on Student's t testing (P less than 0.05). The results show that very little systemic exposure is associated with the microencapsulated form of mitomycin C. Dose escalation should be feasible without increasing systemic toxicity. 
Expression of glutathione S-transferase-pi messenger RNA in human esophageal cancers. The expression of human glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) in resected primary esophageal tumors and in matching normal esophageal mucosa from 25 patients undergoing radical surgery was measured by RNA blot hybridization. The RNA transcript levels of GST-pi in the tumor tissues were higher than those in normal tissues in 20 of 25 cases (80%). The mean GST-pi mRNA value in the tumor tissues (n = 25) was significantly (P less than 0.01) elevated as compared with that in background mucosa (n = 29), and in ten of 25 tumors (40%) the level of GST-pi mRNA exceeded the mean normal tissue value by two standard deviations (normal mean value + 2 X SD). The results obtained from the current experiment thus suggests that GST-pi might be a useful marker for human esophageal cancer. No correlation between GST-pi mRNA level and clinical stage or histologic characteristics was apparent. 
Adhesion formation after laparoscopic surgery in tubal pregnancy: a randomized trial versus laparotomy. OBJECTIVE: Women with ectopic pregnancy (EP) who have been operated on by laparoscopy are thought to have improved subsequent fertility, probably because of less adhesion formation. We aimed to evaluate the adhesion formation after laparoscopy as compared with laparotomy in a randomized trial. DESIGN: One hundred five patients with tubal pregnancy were stratified with regard to age and risk factors and randomized to surgery by laparoscopy or laparotomy. To evaluate adhesion formation and tubal status, 73 patients with strong desire of pregnancy underwent a second-look laparoscopy. The adhesion status at the ipsilateral and contralateral side at primary surgery was compared with the status at second-look laparoscopy. RESULTS: Patients operated on by laparotomy developed significantly more adhesions at the operated side than patients operated on by laparoscopy (P less than 0.001). Substantially more patients in the laparotomy group underwent adhesiolysis at second-look laparoscopy than did patients in the laparoscopy group. Tubal patency did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic treatment of EP results in less impairment of the pelvic status compared with conventional conservative surgery. 
Expression of intrahepatic hepatitis D viral antigen in chronic hepatitis D virus infection. To elucidate the biological importance of intrahepatic hepatitis D virus antigen, its expression was correlated with biochemical and histological inflammatory activity in 98 biopsy specimens from 68 patients seropositive for total antibody to the virus. Seventy five specimens were positive for intrahepatic nuclear antigen for HDV antigen accompanied by cytoplasmic HDV antigen in only one biopsy specimen. This group had significantly higher serum transaminase activities and inflammatory activity than the remaining cases that were negative for HDV antigen. Among the group positive for HDV antigen, there was no correlation between the proportion of hepatocytes containing HDV antigen and either serum transaminase activity or histological inflammatory indices. In 22 HDV antigen positive patients who had follow up biopsy specimens taken at a median of two years, the proportion with cirrhosis increased from 36% to 73%. Serum transaminase activities remained the same during this period, but the proportion of HDV antigen positive cells dropped. Follow up of 51 patients showed that 21 died or underwent liver transplantation within three years. The absence of an association between intrahepatic HDV antigen expression and progression of histological liver damage does not support the view that HDV is directly cytopathic to hepatocytes. Immune mediated mechanisms may have a role in the pathogenesis of chronic liver disease related to HDV infection. 
Patterns of mortality in sickle cell disease in the United Kingdom. Eighteen of 384 patients entered on the Brent sickle cell disease register died between 1974 and 1989, a mortality of one per 128 years of follow up. Two children died from acute splenic sequestration and a third died from fulminant pneumococcal septicaemia: none was taking prophylactic penicillin. Acute chest syndrome was the cause of death in eight young adults and one child. Three deaths occurred after surgery. Cerebrovascular accidents contributed to the cause of death in three cases and there were two sudden unexplained deaths. Ten of the deaths occurred at home or within 24 hours of admission to hospital. Post mortem examinations were made in 14 cases, but the histological appearances of acute chest syndrome were often not recognised. In most cases for whom information was available, the cause of death (chest syndrome, pneumococcal sepsis, postoperative complications) could have been prevented. 
Evidence of c-myc gene abnormalities in mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma of young adult age. Six cases of mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (MLCL) with sclerosis were analyzed for the presence and patterns of c-myc and bcl-2 loci rearrangements, and for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus DNA sequences by Southern blot hybridization, c-myc gene alterations were found in three of six cases. Two cases showed the presence of mutations or small rearrangements at the 3' end of the first exon. The c-myc gene abnormalities found in these two cases are similar to those observed in the translocation 8;14 of the endemic Burkitt's lymphomas or in its variants t(2;8) and t(8;22). A third case showed a major rearrangement of c-myc gene, with truncation within its first intron, similar to those observed in sporadic Burkitt's and in acquired immunodeficiency-associated lymphomas. None of the cases displayed bcl-2 gene rearrangements or contained viral sequences. Our data suggest a possible role for a translocation-mediated c-myc activation in the pathogenesis of MLCL. Conversely, bcl-2 gene and Epstein-Barr virus do not appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of these peculiar lymphomas. The association between c-myc structural modifications and MLCL also seems to be of relevance in light of the peculiar tendency of this tumor to involve unusual extranodal site (eg, kidney), reminiscent of the spreading attitude of Burkitt's limphomas. 
Mortality among workers exposed to ethylene oxide. BACKGROUND. Ethylene oxide is a sterilant gas that causes leukemia and other cancers in animals. Studies in Sweden have shown an excess of leukemia and stomach cancer in humans exposed to ethylene oxide, but other studies have generally failed to confirm these findings. METHODS. We conducted a study of mortality in 18,254 U.S. workers exposed to ethylene oxide at 14 plants producing sterilized medical supplies and spices. The subjects averaged 4.9 years of exposure to the gas and 16 years of follow-up. The exposure levels in recent years averaged 4.3 ppm (eight-hour time-weighted adjusted exposure) for sterilizer operators and 2.0 ppm for other workers. The levels in earlier years are likely to have been several times higher. Mortality in this cohort was compared with that in the general U.S. population. RESULTS. Overall there was no significant increase in mortality from any cause in the study cohort. The standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were 0.97 for leukemia (95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 1.67; 13 deaths observed), 1.06 for all hematopoietic cancers (95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 1.47; 36 deaths), and 0.94 for stomach cancer (95 percent confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.70; 11 deaths). Analyses according to job category and according to the duration of exposure showed no excess in cancers, as compared with the rate in the general population, but there was a significant trend toward increased mortality with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure for all hematopoietic cancers. The rate of death from hematopoietic cancer (especially non-Hodgkin's lymphoma) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 1.55; 27 deaths). Mortality from leukemia in recent years (1985 through 1987) was significantly increased among men (SMR, 3.45; 5 deaths). CONCLUSIONS. For the entire cohort, there was no increase in mortality from hematopoietic cancer. There was a slight but significant increase among men, however. Among men and women combined, there was a trend toward an increased risk of death from hematopoietic cancer with increasing lengths of time since the first exposure to ethylene oxide. 
Propranolol ameliorates the development of portal-systemic shunting in a chronic murine schistosomiasis model of portal hypertension. We investigated the role of early portal hypotensive pharmacotherapy in preventing the development of portal-systemic shunting in a portal hypertensive model of chronic murine schistosomiasis induced by infecting C3H mice with 60 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Propranolol was administered in drinking water to 20 animals for a period of 6 wk at a dose of 10 mg.kg-1d-1, starting at 5 wk of schistosomal infection. 32 age-matched mice with chronic schistosomal infection served as controls. All animals were studied 11 wk after the infection. Compared with controls the portal pressure (10.8 +/- 0.40 mmHg) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in the propranolol-treated animals (7.9 +/- 0.80 mmHg). Portal-systemic shunting was decreased by 79%, from 12.2 +/- 3.34% in controls to 2.5 +/- 0.99% in the propranolol group (P less than 0.05). Portal venous inflow was reduced by 38% in the propranolol treated animals (2.50 +/- 0.73 ml/min; n = 6) compared with controls (4.00 +/- 0.34 ml/min; n = 8; P less than 0.05). The worm burden, the granulomatous reaction, the collagen content of the liver, and the serum bile acid levels were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. These results demonstrate that in chronic liver disease induced by schistosomiasis, the development of portal-systemic shunting can be decreased or prevented by the reduction of flow and pressure in the portal system. 
Arrhythmogenic effects of graded coronary blood flow reductions superimposed on prior myocardial infarction in dogs. BACKGROUND. We studied arrhythmogenesis and its underlying pathophysiology during graded reductions of coronary blood flow, superimposed on prior myocardial infarction to test the hypothesis that spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and induced ventricular tachycardia are dependent on different patterns of coronary flow reduction in hearts with prior myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. In 10 sham-operated dogs (control group) and 24 dogs with 3-week-old experimental apical myocardial infarction, the left circumflex coronary artery was constricted to produce four grades of flow reduction: 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%. Among the sham-operated control animals, only one of 10 (10%) developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and only two of nine (22%) were inducible into sustained ventricular tachycardia during 100% circumflex coronary artery flow reduction. No spontaneous ventricular fibrillation or inducible ventricular tachycardia occurred with lesser grades (25%, 50%, or 75%) of flow reduction among the control animals. In the myocardial infarction group, five of 24 dogs (21%) were inducible before flow reduction. However, 50% flow reduction in the myocardial infarction group resulted in inducibility of ventricular tachycardia in 12 of 24 dogs (50%); nine of 16 (56%) during 75% flow reduction; and six of 11 (55%) with 100% flow reduction. In addition, none of the dogs in the myocardial infarction group developed spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during 25% or 50% flow reduction, whereas six of 22 (27%) developed ventricular fibrillation during 75% flow reduction and 10 of 21 (48%) during 100% flow reduction. In dogs with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation during flow reduction, the total myocardial mass of the ischemic "risk" zone and infarcted zone was significantly greater than in those without spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (68 +/- 5% versus 56 +/- 6% [p less than 0.01]). There was no difference in the total myocardial mass of the ischemic risk zone and infarcted zone between dogs with and without inducible ventricular tachycardia during flow reduction. CONCLUSIONS. In canine model of subacute myocardial infarction, superimposed ischemia increased the likelihood of inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia with lesser grades of coronary flow reduction compared with that necessary to allow spontaneous ventricular fibrillation. The underlying pathophysiology appears to differ between spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and electrically induced sustained ventricular tachycardia. 
Prevention of bacterial infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. A randomized, multicenter trial comparing norfloxacin with ciprofloxacin. The GIMEMA Infection Program. Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin in preventing bacterial infection in neutropenic patients. DESIGN: A randomized, controlled, multicenter trial. SETTING: Twenty-one hematologic units in tertiary care or university hospitals. PATIENTS: Eight hundred and one consecutive, afebrile, adult patients who had hematologic malignancies or who had bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (neutrophil count, less than 1000/mm3) expected to last more than 10 days. INTERVENTION: Patients were randomly assigned to receive orally every 12 hours norfloxacin, 400 mg, or ciprofloxacin, 500 mg. MEASUREMENTS: Efficacy analysis was done for 619 patients: 319 treated with norfloxacin and 300 treated with ciprofloxacin. MAIN RESULTS: More patients receiving ciprofloxacin did not develop fever during neutropenia and did not receive antibiotics (34%) compared with those receiving norfloxacin (25%) (P = 0.01). Patients receiving ciprofloxacin had a lower rate of microbiologically documented infection (17% compared with 24%; P = 0.058), particularly of infection from gram-negative bacilli (4% compared with 9%; P = 0.03). The interval to the first febrile episode was also longer in patients receiving ciprofloxacin (8.3 compared with 7.2 days; P = 0.055). The rates of clinically documented infection, fever of unknown origin, and mortality as well as compliance and tolerability were similar in the two groups. Patients who had neutropenia for less than 15 days, who had severe neutropenia for less than 7 days, and who received antifungal prophylaxis benefited most from ciprofloxacin therapy. CONCLUSION: Ciprofloxacin should be used to prevent the development of infection in neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancies. 
Adjuvant whole-abdominal radiation therapy in uterine papillary serous carcinoma. Nine patients from 34 to 74 years of age (median, 67 years of age) with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) were treated with whole-abdominal radiation therapy (WART) on an adjuvant basis after cytoreductive surgery. All patients were treated with megavoltage photons to an abdominopelvic field to a median dose of 2500 cGy, with continued treatment to a whole pelvic field to a median dose of 4500 cGy. Three patients received additional boost to the vaginal apex. Follow-up time ranged from 6 to 31 months (median, 25 months) after completion of WART. Six patients had recurrent disease at 5 to 20 months (median, 7.5 months). Four of these patients died of their disease during the follow-up period. Three of six patients in whom treatment failed had disease at the vaginal apex. None of these patients received boost radiation therapy to that site. In contrast, two of three patients remaining disease free were treated with additional vaginal apex irradiation. Based on these results, the authors do not routinely recommend WART for adjuvant treatment of UPSC. They do, however, recommend vaginal apex irradiation for these patients. 
Increased plasma endothelin-1 in the early hours of acute myocardial infarction. Endothelin is a novel endothelium-derived vasoactive peptide with potent vasoconstrictor action in the coronary bed; however, its possible contribution to myocardial ischemia and infarction is not known. Plasma endothelin-1 concentration was measured with use of a radioimmunoassay in serial venous samples from 22 patients over a 72 h period after acute myocardial infarction (14 patients with uncomplicated infarction [group I] and 8 patients with hemodynamic or ischemic sequelae [group II]). Twenty-two normal subjects and seven patients with stable angina served as the control subjects. Endothelin-1 levels in patients with stable coronary disease were not different from those of normal subjects (0.62 +/- 0.56 and 0.76 +/- 0.38 pg/ml, respectively). In group I, plasma levels of endothelin-1 rose sharply after myocardial infarction, reaching a peak of 4.95 +/- 0.78 pg/ml at 6 h after the onset of chest pain (p less than 0.05 compared with values in control subjects) and returning rapidly toward the normal range by 24 h. Patients with complicated infarction (group II) demonstrated a similar rapid increase in plasma endothelin-1 to a peak value of 8.29 +/- 1.95 pg/ml; however, plasma endothelin-1 remained elevated in these patients, becoming significantly different from values in group I at 48 and 72 h. There was no correlation between peak increases in creatine kinase and peak endothelin-1 in either group, suggesting that the stimulus for elevation of endothelin-1 was not myocardial necrosis itself. Furthermore, left ventricular ejection fraction did not correlate with the increase in endothelin-1 in group I patients, whereas there was a significant inverse relation between ventricular function and plasma endothelin-1 in group II. 
Legionella myositis. Neuromuscular involvement in patients with legionnaires' disease is common, with serum CK elevations in up to 78% of patients. A few cases have been associated with neuropathy. The mechanism of injury to the neuromuscular system is unknown, but organisms have not previously been found in nerve or muscle. We report the clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic findings in a patient with Legionella myositis and motor neuropathy, the first case to demonstrate direct muscle invasion by the Legionella organism. 
Lichen planus and mesalazine. Lichen planus is a recognized complication of sulfasalazine therapy. Two patients developed typical oral and cutaneous lichen planus on sulfasalazine and their skin lesions recurred when they were subsequently changed to mesalazine. Lichen planus only resolved on withdrawal of both drugs. It seems likely that the aminosalicylic acid moiety is responsible for this reaction and that lichen planus is a true complication of mesalazine therapy. 
Plantar fasciitis. Etiology, treatment, surgical results, and review of the literature. Plantar fasciitis is a common orthopedic syndrome among athletes and nonathletes. The etiology of the pain is multifactorial but usually involves inflammation and degeneration of the plantar fascia origin. The majority of patients will respond to conservative measures. Surgical treatment is reserved for those patients who do not respond. A complete plantar fascia release is performed through a medial longitudinal incision. Prominent heel spurs and degenerated areas in the plantar fascia are resected. Of 27 surgically treated cases followed from one to three years, satisfactory results were obtained in 24 cases. Histologically, localized fibrosis or granulomatous changes or both were noted in several cases. 
Creatine kinase isoenzyme band mimicking CK MB on agarose gel electrophoresis. The authors report the case of an 80-year-old man with prostatic disease whose serum contained an aberrant band in the MB position on agarose gel electrophoresis of creatine kinase (CK) isoenzymes. The authors demonstrated that the band probably was CK BB; the patient had no evidence of myocardial infarction. Contrary to most previous reports of such cases, the aberrant enzyme did not appear to be linked with IgG, IgA, or IgM; it also did not behave as if attached to a chelatable cation. Care must be taken to avoid mistaking such bands for CK MB. 
Does cigarette smoking have an independent effect on coronary heart disease incidence in the elderly? In order to evaluate the effects of cigarette smoking on coronary heart disease (CHD) in elderly persons in the Honolulu Heart Program, 1,394 men between ages 65 and 74 were followed during an average 12-year period for new cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD. Incidence rates increased progressively in individuals classified at baseline as never, former, and current smokers, respectively. The absolute excess risk associated with cigarette smoking was nearly twice as high in elderly compared with middle-aged men. 
Muscle mitochondrial DNA in encephalomyopathy and ragged red fibres: a Southern blot analysis and literature review. Various mitochondrial DNA abnormalities have been described in patients with encephalomyopathies. We performed Southern blot analysis of skeletal muscle mitochondrial DNA in nine adult patients with clinical features and ragged red fibres suggesting mitochondrial dysfunction. Two patients with encephalomyopathy and two with the MERRF syndrome (myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibres) had the normal PvuII restriction pattern of muscle mitochondrial DNA. In contrast, mitochondrial DNA deletion was observed in two of six patients with ophthalmoplegia. One suffered from typical Kearns-Sayre syndrome and the other from isolated external ophthalmoplegia. None of these patients had affected relatives. The detection of mitochondrial DNA deletion in external ophthalmoplegia and their site and size support previously reported data. 
Acute positive inotropic intervention: the phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors that are selective for cAMP-specific cardiac and vascular PDE III comprise a new group of agents for the treatment of heart failure, which at present are limited to clinical shortterm intravenous use and research uses only. Although both intravenous amrinone and milrinone are FDA approved, only amrinone is available for general clinical use. Selective phosphodiesterase inhibition produces beneficial actions of positive inotropy and peripheral vasodilation that result from increased cardiac and vascular muscle concentrations of intracellular cAMP and ionic calcium. In addition, a positive lusitropic action (enhancement of cardiac relaxation) has been observed. Neither beta-adrenergic agonist activity nor inhibition of the sodium-potassium ATPase is produced by these agents. The magnitude of hemodynamic improvement generally exceeds that of the cardiac glycosides and is comparable with that of intravenous catecholamines such as dobutamine. The different pharmacodynamic profile of the PDE inhibitors is additive to the effects of cardiac glycosides, complementary and synergistic to the actions of catecholamines, and has been shown to have favorable effects on coronary hemodynamics. As a result there is continued enthusiasm for the short-term intravenous use of amrinone and potentially milrinone in the setting of acute heart failure resulting from systolic dysfunction (after myocardial infarction, open heart surgery, or infectious or toxic myocarditis), heart failure resulting from right ventricular systolic dysfunction, and when patients with severe heart failure await cardiac transplantation. Initiation of treatment with an intravenous bolus followed by a maintenance infusion provides prompt increases in stroke volume and cardiac output and simultaneous reductions in right and left ventricular filling pressures and systemic vascular resistance. 
Consequences of the nuclear power plant accident at Chernobyl [published erratum appears in Public Health Rep 1991 May-Jun;106(3):352] The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), on April 26, 1986, was the first major nuclear power plant accident that resulted in a large-scale fire and subsequent explosions, immediate and delayed deaths of plant operators and emergency service workers, and the radioactive contamination of a significant land area. The release of radioactive material, over a 10-day period, resulted in millions of Soviets, and other Europeans, being exposed to measurable levels of radioactive fallout. Because of the effects of wind and rain, the radioactive nuclide fallout distribution patterns are not well defined, though they appear to be focused in three contiguous Soviet Republics: the Ukrainian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR, and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Further, because of the many radioactive nuclides (krypton, xenon, cesium, iodine, strontium, plutonium) released by the prolonged fires at Chernobyl, the long-term medical, psychological, social, and economic effects will require careful and prolonged study. Specifically, studies on the medical (leukemia, cancers, thyroid disease) and psychological (reactive depressions, post-traumatic stress disorders, family disorganization) consequences of continued low dose radiation exposure in the affected villages and towns need to be conducted so that a coherent, comprehensive, community-oriented plan may evolve that will not cause those already affected any additional harm and confusion. 
Spontaneous near disappearance of bilateral coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistulas. Although coronary artery fistula is a relatively rare anomaly, it sometimes develops with advancing age, requiring surgical removal. We report a unique case of a patient whose bilateral coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistulas nearly disappeared in the course of four years. This case is interesting in view of recognizing one of the natural courses of this entity. 
Cerebral blood flow changes in migraine: methods, observations and hypotheses. A number of basically different methods have been used in studies of the cerebrovascular changes which occur in migraine and each individual set of findings seems to be dependent on which method is used. One method on its own can only disclose a part of all the pathophysiological events. This review is an attempt to consider the capabilities of each method and to bring together the results from different studies on migraine in order to create a complete picture of the cerebrovascular changes which occur during the course of a migraine attack. 
Pulmonary oedema after airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. We report a case of pulmonary oedema which developed after airway obstruction due to bilateral vocal cord paralysis. The patient was a 52-yr-old woman undergoing craniotomy for an acoustic neuroma. Anaesthesia was uneventful. Spontaneous ventilation resumed after reversal of neuromuscular blockade. Following extubation she showed signs of airway obstruction and dyspnoea. The trachea was reintubated but she became hypoxic, PaO2-36 mmHg, produced pink frothy secretions and the x-ray was typical of pulmonary oedema. The oedema cleared within 24 hr. Tracheostomy was performed one week later as the cords were still fixed, but the latter had recovered by three months and the tracheostomy was closed. The cause of the cord paralysis is unknown but probably was a result of surgical trauma to the brain stem. 
Progression of coronary atherosclerosis: is coronary spasm related to progression? A total of 239 patients undergoing serial coronary angiography with a concomitant ergonovine provocation test were studied between July 1974 and June 1987. The progression of coronary artery disease was evaluated in relation to risk factors, especially coronary artery spasm. Patients were classified into three groups: 1) new myocardial infarction group (39 patients); 2) progression without infarction group (90 patients); and 3) nonprogression group (110 patients). To assess how risk factors and coronary spasm are related to the occurrence of new myocardial infarction and progression without infarction, 11 variables in the three groups were examined: age, gender, the time interval between the studies, fasting blood sugar, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, smoking, serum cholesterol, triglyceride, uric acid and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test. Multiple regression analysis selected three independent predictors of progression without infarction: cholesterol (p less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test (p less than 0.001). Multiple regression analysis also selected three independent predictors of the occurrence of new myocardial infarction: fasting blood sugar (p less than 0.01), systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.05) and a positive response to the ergonovine provocation test (p less than 0.001). A positive response to the ergonovine provocation test was the strongest factor for occurrence of both new myocardial infarction and progression without infarction. To evaluate segmental arterial changes, 3,275 coronary artery segments were analyzed in the 239 patients. 
Reductions in cirrhosis deaths in the United States: associations with per capita consumption and AA membership. Cirrhosis mortality and morbidity rates have declined in many jurisdictions, including the U.S., in recent years. Previous research in Canada and Europe suggests that these declines are linked to changes in per capita consumption of alcohol and changes in the availability and/or utilization of services to reduce abusive drinking (e.g., treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous). In this study, changes in cirrhosis death rates in the 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia between 1974 and 1983 were regressed onto changes in per capita consumption (1974-83). AA membership (1974-83) and alcoholism treatment (1979-82). No significant relationship between treatment and cirrhosis changes was observed; however, the measure of change in treatment may not reflect the full extent of changes that occurred in the 1974-83 period. As predicted, decreases in per capita consumption and increases in AA membership were significantly associated with decreases in cirrhosis rates. 
Severe, symptomatic, dose-limiting hypophosphatemia induced by hepatic arterial infusion of recombinant tumor necrosis factor in patients with liver metastases. Twenty-two patients with liver metastases received 45 courses of recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) by hepatic arterial infusion in doses ranging from 12.5 to 175 micrograms/m2/d for 5 days by continuous infusion. The induction of statistically significant, dose-related, severe, albeit transient, hypophosphatemia (less than 1.0 mg/dl) associated with clinically significant, right-sided myocardial dysfunction and severe lassitude was observed. These side effects were promptly reversed after rTNF was stopped and intravenous phosphate supplementation was started. As no significant or consistent increase in urinary phosphate excretion was detected, the rTNF-induced hypophosphatemia probably resulted from an intracellular shift of phosphate. Since tumor regression was clearly associated with the lowest levels of serum phosphate, hypophosphatemia may be important in the antitumor effects of rTNF. 
Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma: an additional component of Carney's complex. Report of a case. The authors report a case of Carney's complex (the complex of myxomas, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity) in a 32-year-old white man. Psammomatous melanotic schwannoma has recently been included as a component of this disorder. The complex was recognized after a psammomatous melanotic schwannoma was resected from the sacral canal. Subsequent echocardiography revealed ventricular cardiac myxomata. Resection of these lesions was successfully performed. Review of previous history and pathologic material further supported the diagnosis. The authors conclude that recognition of each component as part of the syndrome is of crucial importance, because it may prevent a fatal outcome. A family screening program should be performed in each case. 
Lower-extremity vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease: prospective evaluation with duplex Doppler sonography. Eighty-five men with 92 vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity underwent a total of 264 examinations with duplex Doppler over a 2.5-year period. In 64 patients who underwent more than one examination, the total follow-up encompassed 740 months. In 220 native femoral arteries (96.0%) the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was higher than that in the graft. Arteriovenous shunting was associated with a normal PSV and a markedly elevated diastolic component at spectral analysis. Focal fluid collections were common initially near the graft and usually disappeared uneventfully. An average PSV of 32 cm/sec or less was always associated with impending occlusion. The sensitivity of an average PSV of 40 cm/sec or less to indicate impending graft occlusion by the next visit was only 33%; the specificity, 94%. At initial examination, stenoses were associated with high PSV focally in the graft or low PSV with absent diastolic flow. 
Ulcerative colitis in the autotransplanted neovagina. A 33-year-old woman had undergone a radical surgical excision for carcinoma of the vagina at age 11. Vaginal reconstruction using a pedicled transplant of the sigmoid colon was successfully accomplished at age 19. Fourteen years later she developed vaginal bleeding, and a biopsy of the neovagina revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Within 2 weeks the patient developed bleeding per ano, and a rectal biopsy also revealed changes consistent with ulcerative colitis. Symptoms responded to sulfasalazine. This is believed to be the first case report of ulcerative colitis developing in colonic tissue used for a neovagina. The etiology, natural history, and surveillance of ulcerative colitis in relation to this unique case are reviewed. This case argues against the hypothesis that chronic ulcerative colitis is causally related to direct exposure to alimentary antigens. 
Effect of interferon administration on serum hepatitis C virus RNA in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus RNA as detected by reverse transcription and nested polymerase chain reaction was monitored in 16 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon. Hepatitis C virus RNA became undetectable after 4 to 8 wk of interferon administration in 13 of the 16 patients. During 6 mo of follow-up, 5 of the 13 patients who became negative for hepatitis C virus RNA after interferon administration remained negative, and all five continued to have normal ALT levels. Repeat liver biopsy in these five patients revealed histological improvement. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, which was initially positive in all treated patients, fell to undetectable levels in three of the five patients. In contrast, aminotransferase levels rose again in all eight patients who had become hepatitis C virus RNA negative but had again exhibited hepatitis C virus RNA after completion of therapy. In 16 untreated patients, hepatitis C virus RNA remained detectable. These results indicate that detection of hepatitis C virus RNA may be useful as a marker of viral replication in chronic hepatitis C; they also suggest that interferon should again be administered to patients who become hepatitis C virus RNA negative on treatment but again exhibit this marker of viral replication when treatment is stopped. 
Partial hypoparathyroidism. A variant of transient congenital hypoparathyroidism. We encountered three children who had neonatal hypocalcemia followed by a period of normocalcemia and recurrence of hypocalcemia later in childhood. They were full-term infants with normal birth weights who developed hypocalcemia within the first 48 hours after birth. The hypocalcemia resolved in 1 week, 3 months, and 14 months in the three patients. The recurrences of hypocalcemia occurred at 4, 7, and 12 years of age. Their plasma parathyroid hormone concentrations were consistently low but detectable. We suggest that partial hypoparathyroidism is the underlying abnormality in these patients and that neonatal hypocalcemia in otherwise healthy infants indicates the need for calcium measurements during childhood and adolescence. 
Comparison of the aortic homograft and the pulmonary autograft for aortic valve or root replacement in children. To assess late results of aortic homograft and pulmonary autograft valves implanted into the left ventricular outflow tract of children, we reviewed the case histories of 146 patients 18 years of age or younger who underwent aortic valve or root replacement between November 1964 and April 1990. One hundred three patients (mean, 12 +/- 3.9 years) received an aortic homograft and 43 (mean, 14 +/- 4.1 years) had their own pulmonary valve transferred to the aortic position. There were 54 valve and 49 root replacements with homografts and 36 valve and seven root replacements with autografts. Hospital mortality rate was 15.5% (16 patients) in the homograft group and 11.6% (five patients) in the autograft group. Survivors were followed up for a total of 867 (homograft) and 297 (autograft) patient-years. The late mortality rate was 16.7% (1.9% per patient-year) for patients with homografts and 13.2% (4.4% per patient-year) for patients with autografts, whereas the incidence for reoperation per patient-year was 2.9% and 2.0%, respectively. At 15 years actuarial rates for homografts and autografts for freedom from reoperation were 54% +/- 8.1% and 68% +/- 11.1%; freedom from endocarditis, 97% +/- 2.4% and 75% +/- 10.2%; and freedom from any complication, 41% +/- 6.5% and 50% +/- 10.3%. Valve degeneration occurred in 19 homografts (2.2% per patient-year), whereas there was no definite instance of primary tissue failure among the pulmonary autografts. This experience would indicate that either the homograft or the autograft valve can be used with acceptable results in children. However, the pulmonary autograft gives better long-term performance and, if growth potential is realized, may be the ideal valve substitute in children. 
The relationship of sodium balance and concomitant diuretic therapy to blood pressure response with calcium channel entry blockers. Marked heterogeneity exists in the response of blood pressure to specific antihypertensive agents. In general, a single therapeutic agent can be expected to provide an adequate blood pressure response in 40% to 60% of hypertensive patients. The addition of a second agent usually extends the response rate to over 85%. The addition of a diuretic to nondiuretic regimens often produces an additive blood pressure-lowering effect. However, calcium channel entry blockers (CCBs) may be an exception, as diuretics do not appear to improve these agents' efficacy. CCBs have a dual mechanism for blood pressure reduction. In addition to their vasodilatory actions, they also promote diuresis and natriuresis. These features account for the striking efficacy of these agents when used as monotherapy in hypertensive patients. Studies have shown that dietary sodium restriction does not appear to improve the efficacy of CCBs, nor is a high-salt diet predictive of a better therapeutic outcome. Recent studies also indicate that the addition of a diuretic to a CCB does not produce a significant or consistent additive antihypertensive effect. Because CCBs do not produce the typical responses of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) system to sodium/volume depletion, their diuretic and natriuretic effects do not result in the same adverse metabolic consequences as experienced with traditional diuretic therapy. 
Fibrin fragment D-dimer and fibrinogen B beta peptides in plasma as markers of clot lysis during thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction. The validity of markers in plasma of in vitro thrombolysis was investigated in 12 patients with extensive fibrinogen breakdown (greater than 80%, group 1) and in 12 patients with minimal breakdown (less than 20%, group 2). The patients were treated with 100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) in the "Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction II" (TIMI II) trial. Cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels were measured with two variant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), both using a fibrin fragment D-dimer specific capture antibody. In one instance, a tag antibody was used that cross-reacts with fibrinogen (pan-specific tag ELISA); in the other, the tag antibody was specific for fibrin fragment D (fibrin-specific tag ELISA). Apparent concentrations of cross-linked fibrin degradation products at baseline were within normal limits with both assays in most patients. At 8 hours after rt-PA infusion, the measured cross-linked fibrin degradation products were increased about twofold to fourfold in group 2 with both assays. However, in group 1, levels were significantly higher with the pan-specific tag ELISA (5.8 +/- 4.2 micrograms/mL) compared with the fibrin-specific tag ELISA (1.5 +/- 1.3 micrograms/mL). This observation was most likely a result of detection of fibrinogen degradation products in the pan-specific ELISA. Apparent levels of fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42, a marker of fragment X formation, increased during thrombolysis from 4.2 +/- 2.8 pmol/mL to 2,000 +/- 230 pmol/mL in group 1 and from 4.1 +/- 2.1 pmol/mL to 300 +/- 43 pmol/mL in group 2, and were correlated significantly with the extent of fibrinogen breakdown (r = -0.8). Fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 levels increased from 4.3 +/- 3 pmol/mL to 70 +/- 19 pmol/mL in group 1, but did not increase in group 2. The apparent increase in group 1 could be explained by cross-reactivity of fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42 in the fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 assay. We conclude that cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels as measured with a pan-specific tag ELISA and fibrinopeptide beta 15-42 levels as measured with certain monoclonal antibody-based ELISA are influenced by the extent of fibrinogen degradation. Fibrinopeptide B beta 1-42 is a marker specific for fibrinogen breakdown. Cross-linked fibrin degradation product levels, measured with a fibrin-specific tag ELISA, appear to be markers specific for thrombolysis. Consequently, assays similar to the fibrin-specific tag ELISA may provide more accurate information when correlated with clinical endpoints. 
Management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma. The surgical management of labyrinthine fistulas caused by cholesteatoma remains controversial. Forty cases (41 ears) of labyrinthine fistulas were reviewed. This represented 10% of our total series of cholesteatomas in adults and children (426 ears). Clinical presentation, extent of disease, results of fistula testing and audiometric studies, and radiographic findings were analyzed. A canal wall-down procedure was performed in all but one patient. Generally an attempt was made to completely remove the cholesteatoma, to graft the fistulous area, and to reconstruct the middle ear mechanism in one stage. The matrix was preserved in patients with large fistulas where the involved ear was the only hearing one, when the matrix was adherent to the underlying optic duct, and in selected elderly persons. Long-term followup did not reveal a significant difference in hearing, degree of vertigo, or incidence of recidivism when those patients in whom the matrix was removed were compared with those in whom the matrix was preserved. The importance of recognizing the presence of a labyrinthine fistula preoperatively is stressed, along with the need to be prepared for an unexpected fistula. Operative management is described. 
Catecholaminergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus of normal individuals and patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The parabrachial nucleus is believed to play a role in autonomic regulation. We have used the Fontana-Masson ammoniacal silver nitrate method and a tyrosine hydroxylase-immunostaining technique to demonstrate the presence of neuromelanin-containing catecholaminergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus of normal individuals. In addition, we also show that there is a significant reduction of these catecholaminergic neurons and presence of Lewy bodies in the parabrachial nucleus of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. These findings may be related to the several autonomic disturbances that may occur in idiopathic Parkinson's disease. 
A loading dose/continuous infusion schedule of fludarabine phosphate in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Using a loading dose/continuous infusion schedule, fludarabine phosphate was administered to 51 patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). All patients had evidence of active disease, and the majority had advanced Rai stages. Of the 42 patients assessable for response, 22 (52%) achieved a partial response, five (12%) had stable disease, and 15 (36%) progressed. Thirteen of the 22 responders improved their Rai stages with fludarabine therapy, including six patients who achieved stage 0. Response rates for pretreatment stages III and IV were 60% and 53%, respectively. Patients with final Rai stages 0 to II had better survival than those with stages III and IV. Patients who had undergone splenectomy before starting therapy were more likely to respond. Myelosuppression was the primary toxicity and did not appear to be cumulative. Severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, although infrequent, were associated with several deaths in the early cycles of treatment. Nonhematologic toxicity was mild with no serious neurotoxicity noted. Infections were common with 22 minor, 18 major, and 10 fatal episodes. Fludarabine phosphate by this alternative dosing schedule is effective in refractory advanced CLL and is well tolerated by the majority of patients. 
Response to tumor necrosis factor in two cases of psoriasis. A 70-year-old woman was treated for renal cell carcinoma with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor, 450,000 U/m2 of body surface area, daily for 5 days, once a month. She had had psoriasis for 25 years. After two courses of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor her psoriasis resolved. A 40-year-old man with severe psoriasis was subsequently treated with a total of seven complete and incomplete 5-day courses of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor at doses of 50,000 to 300,000 U/m2/day. Significant toxicity (fever, chills, hypertension, and hypotension) was encountered. Partial resolution of the lesions was seen. Tumor necrosis factor is an active agent in psoriasis. 
Prostaglandin F2 alpha and indomethacin in hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia. Effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange. We treated a 68-year-old man with cirrhosis of the liver associated with moderate hypoxemia. Contrast-enhanced echocardiography revealed late opacification of the left ventricle, and pulmonary perfusion imaging with 99mTc macroaggregated albumin showed evidence of a significant uptake in both lungs and in the liver, spleen, and kidneys. Right cardiac catheterization revealed pulmonary hypotension, low pulmonary vascular resistance, and high cardiac output. We administered prostaglandin F2 alpha intravenously (0.2 microgram/kg/min for 30 minutes) and indomethacin orally (75 mg/day for three days). There was some degree of resolution of the hypoxemia and increases in both pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance. These findings suggest that the pathophysiology of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a reversible intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. These conditions can to some extent be modulated by vasoactive substances such as prostaglandins or other eicosanoids. 
The effects of adenotonsillectomy on growth in young children. A history of poor weight gain can often be elicited in young children with chronic upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. A series of 41 consecutive children under 3 years of age, who underwent inpatient adenotonsillectomy, were reviewed for changes in weight and height. Thirty-seven patients had adequate long-term follow-up. Of these, many had dramatic improvements in growth after adenotonsillectomy. Indications for surgery in this group were recurrent infection in three patients (7%), unilateral tonsillar mass in one patient (3%), and upper airway obstruction in 37 patients (90%). A clear history of sleep apnea was elicited in 59%. At the time of surgery, 19 of 41 patients (46%) were of the fifth percentile or lower for age-corrected weight. The inpatient hospital stay averaged 3.2 days. The postoperative complication rate was 27%, with postoperative stridor as the most common complication. After surgery, 28 children (75%) showed a change to a higher percentile for weight. Twenty-four (65%) had percentile changes of 15% or more. This change is significant according to results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p less than 0.001). We conclude that a relationship exists between improved growth rate and adenotonsillectomy in our study group. The rapid improvement in growth appears to be most obvious in children with upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Upper airway obstruction (including andenotonsillar hypertrophy) should be suspected as a possible cause in the workup of children with suboptimum growth. 
Oral almitrine in treatment of acute respiratory failure and cor pulmonale in patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease. The effects of oral almitrine bismesylate, a respiratory stimulant that acts on peripheral arterial chemoreceptors, was studied in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease and hypoxaemic cor pulmonale. Twenty three patients admitted to hospital with an acute exacerbation of ventilatory failure were randomised to receive either almitrine 100 mg twice a day reducing to 50 mg twice a day over 48 hours or placebo in addition to conventional treatment. On admission the mean (SE) values for blood gas tensions were PaO2 4.8 (0.3) and PaCO2 7.7 (0.3) kPa in the 12 patients who received almitrine and PaO2 4.9 (0.1) and PaCO2 7.6 (0.3) kPa in the 11 who received placebo. After three hours of oxygen therapy at 1 1/min there was a similar rise in PaO2 in both groups, 6.4 (0.2) kPa in those receiving almitrine and 6.6 (0.4) kPa in those receiving placebo. After 24 hours of oxygen therapy values of PaO2 were again similar at 6.3 (0.8) kPa and 6.7 (2.2) kPa respectively. Arterial blood gas tensions improved during the study in those who survived but no significant differences were apparent between the two groups. There were six deaths, five in the almitrine group and one in the placebo group. There were no differences between the groups in respiratory rate, results of spirometry, oxygen requirement, or degree of dyspnoea (on visual analogue scale). The results did not show any benefit from oral almitrine in patients with acute respiratory failure secondary to chronic obstructive airways disease. Plasma almitrine concentrations, however, were often below the optimum therapeutic range, suggesting impaired drug absorption. 
Medication-induced esophageal injury: report of 17 cases with endoscopic documentation. We report on medication-induced esophageal injury (MIEI) in 17 patients (six male, 11 female) seen from October 1986 to May 1990. The mean age of patients was 27.3 (SD = 5.7) yr; mean duration of drug ingestion prior to the occurrence of symptoms 10.2 (SD = 11.5) days, and mean duration of symptoms before seeking medical attention 4.6 (SD = 3.8) days. Symptoms subsided after treatment, with a mean of 6 (SD = 2.5) days. Symptoms included odynophagia (in 17), chest pain (six), epigastric pain (three), and retrosternal pain (one). Symptoms occurred after the drug was stopped in three. MIEI was caused by doxycycline (seven), minocycline (five), Pantozyme (one), cloxacillin (one), unknown (two), and dicloxacillin + Danzen (one). Reclining after drug ingestion was the predominant risk factor. Endoscopy showed most ulcers to be multiple and at midesophagus. Barium swallows done in two patients were negative. There is no previous report of Pantozyme (pancreatic enzyme), Danzen (serratio-peptidase), cloxacillin, and dicloxacillin causing MIEI. 
Developing a dysphagia program in an acute care hospital: a needs assessment. A needs assessment for a hospital-based dysphagia program was conducted to determine incidence, management procedures, and outcome for stroke patients with swallowing disorders. Using a chart review of 225 patients, it was found that 28% had documented evidence of dysphagia. When dysphagia co-occurred with stroke, significantly more functional problems and medical complications were reported, as well as increased need for dietary modifications and alternative feeding methods. The dysphagic patients were more often aphasic and dysarthric and less able to communicate. Mental status was more likely to be reduced and the need for staff supervision during mealtime was increased. Dysphagic patients had significantly longer hospital stays, thus increasing the cost of their care. At discharge, almost half of them continued to need feeding modifications, which may have delayed rehabilitation or transfer to facilities with other levels of care. The dysphagia group clearly displayed a wide range of clinical symptoms that would alert staff to their risk for medical complications because of swallowing problems. We believe that this needs assessment clearly showed that a multidisciplinary dysphagia management program has the potential to enhance patient care while decreasing the cost of health care delivery for the hospital. 
Human interleukin-9: genomic sequence, chromosomal location, and sequences essential for its expression in human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I-transformed human T cells. We have isolated the genomic sequence of human interleukin-9 (IL-9) based on its sequence homology with a human IL-9 cDNA isolated from human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV)-I-transformed T cells by expression cloning. The entire genomic sequence has been determined and the gene consists of five exons and four introns. The human IL-9 gene is mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5 at band 5q31-32, a region found to be deleted in a number of patients with acquired 5q- abnormalities and hematologic disorders. Several blocks of transcriptional control sequences have been identified at the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-9 gene that may play an important role in the control of IL-9 gene expression. The 5'-regulatory region of the human IL-9 gene also contains sequences identified in the 5'-flanking regions of other cytokine genes mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5, including IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and other T-cell growth factor genes including IL-2 and IL-6. The IL-9 gene is constitutively expressed in the HTLV-I-transformed human T cells and the expression of IL-9 in these cells can be further induced by 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13-acetate. Transient transfection analysis using the plasmid containing the 5'-flanking region of IL-9 gene upstream from the firefly luciferase ciferase report gene indicated that the 0.9-kb Smal-Sacl fragment of the IL-9 gene contains sequences required for the constitutive and activated expression of IL-9 gene in HTLV-I-transformed cells. These results will now allow us to study the regulatory mechanism of IL-9 gene expression in normal and leukemic human T cells. 
Randomized controlled trial of prophylactic rifampin for peritoneal dialysis-related infections. Staphylococcal infections are a major cause of catheter infections and peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. Since catheter-related infections are associated with nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in this population, we studied the effect of intermittent rifampin, an antibiotic known to decrease S aureus nasal carriage, on catheter-related infections and peritonitis. We randomly assigned 64 patients to receive either rifampin 300 mg twice daily for 5 days every 3 months or no treatment. The rifampin-treated patients had a significant delay in time to first catheter-related infection (P less than 0.015) and significantly fewer catheter-related infections overall (P less than 0.001). The catheter-related infection rate in rifampin-treated patients was .26 per patient-year versus .93 per patient-year in untreated patients. Multivariate analysis defined baseline colonization of nares or catheter exit-site and prior renal transplant as risk factors for catheter-related infections. There was no significant difference in peritonitis rates between groups, although the trend was for a delayed time to first episodes and fewer episodes in rifampin-treated patients. Adverse effects necessitated withdrawal of rifampin in four patients. We conclude that intermittent rifampin administration is effective in decreasing catheter-related infections in a peritoneal dialysis population. 
Dissecting the primary causes of genetic hypertension in rats. Blood pressure has a genetic component influenced by several to many genetic loci in both humans and animals; that is, blood pressure is a polygenic trait. Ultimately, the primary causes of genetic hypertension can only be established with genetic techniques. The primary tools for this analysis in animals are inbred strains of rodents selectively bred for differences in blood pressure and the genetic analysis of these strains by cosegregation techniques. This analysis determines whether it is possible to separate specific alleles at a candidate genetic locus from a component of blood pressure in genetically segregating populations. If the candidate alleles cosegregate with a component of blood pressure, these alleles must be the cause of the blood pressure differences or be linked on the same chromosome to alleles at other loci that cause blood pressure differences. If, on the other hand, the candidate alleles do not cosegregate with blood pressure, they cannot be the cause of the blood pressure differences. This analysis is straightforward in the case of a single-locus Mendelian candidate trait but is less informative if a candidate trait is itself polygenic. In this case, genetic analysis yields either 1) results that are compatible with, but not definitive proof for, a genetic role of the trait in causing blood pressure differences or 2) results that eliminate the trait as a cause of genetic differences in blood pressure. A complete listing of all the traits that have undergone genetic cosegregation analysis in rodents is given. 
The diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy using an algometer. Thirty-three patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy were studied prospectively to ascertain the pressure-pain threshold of affected and unaffected limbs. The affected side had a lower threshold which was found to be statistically significant. In all 18 patients with upper limb involvement, the pain threshold was reduced on the affected side, but this applied to only 11 of the 15 with leg involvement. This difference may be because patients with lower limb symptoms had been referred later in the course of the syndrome. We showed by repeated tests that after an average of 49 days there was a slow return to normality. The estimation of pressure-pain thresholds may help in the earlier diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy. 
Mesh-constricted varicose and dilated veins used as arterial bypass grafts. To avoid non-autogenous vascular prostheses in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures, otherwise unusable dilated, varicose or thin-walled veins can be implanted as naturally endothelialized grafts after being calibrated by insertion into mesh tubes. In six sheep the 14 mm diameter jugular vein was inserted into a 12 cm long, 6 mm diameter Dacron mesh tube and implanted as a femoropopliteal graft. On the contralateral side the femoral vein with a maximal diameter of 7 to 8 mm was implanted. At control angiography after two months all grafts were patent, none of the wrapped grafts showed wrinkles or signs of anastomotic hyperplasia. Segments of wrapped veins were casted in paraffin under physiological pressure and cut transversely. In all cases the vein wall was pressed against the mesh tubes without forming folds. Mesh-wrapped varicose veins were used for three femorocrural and seven femoropopliteal reconstructions. All grafts showed a smooth flow surface at control angiography. Indentations occurred only at sites where thick-walled side branches had been ligated rather than oversewn. One popliteo-pedal reconstruction occluded after two months and one patient with a crural reconstruction died two months after surgery with a patent graft. The remaining grafts were patent after 11 (2-32) months. Oversized veins can be considerably constricted by tubes without forming wrinkles. By this technique varicose veins can be used as bypass grafts and in general vein grafts can be matched in size to the recipient vessel. 
Outcome in children who nearly drown: a British Isles study OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome in nearly drowned children in the British Isles and identify factors that might predict a poor prognosis. DESIGN--Study of drowned and of nearly drowned children aged less than or equal to 14. Information on nearly drowned children admitted to hospital obtained from consultant paediatricians returning monthly notification cards through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Information on drowned children obtained from Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and other national epidemiological offices. SETTING--British Isles, 1988 and 1989. SUBJECTS--330 children who had confirmed submersion incidents. 142 died before admission to hospital and 188 children were admitted after nearly drowning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death, full recovery, or degree of handicap after near drowning and signs on admission to hospital. RESULTS--All of the children who were conscious on admission fully recovered. Of the 64 children unconscious on admission, 31 had normally reactive pupils and all but three (all of whom had severe preexisting neurological disease) recovered fully. Of the 33 children with fixed dilated pupils on admission, 10 fully recovered, 13 died, and 10 had severe neurological deficit. Spontaneous respiratory effect on admission was associated with normal survival. Pupils that remained dilated six hours after admission and fits continuing 24 hours after admission predicted a poor outcome. CONCLUSION--Children can survive normally after near drowning in the British Isles, particularly if they have been hypothermic. Resuscitation should not be abandoned in nearly drowned children until they have been rewarmed. 
Increasing breast cancer screening among the medically underserved--Dade County, Florida, September 1987-March 1991. Efforts to detect breast cancer at early stages are critical in reducing breast cancer-associated mortality. However, in the United States, different barriers (e.g., lack of insurance, limited access to medical care, and limited awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment) prevent certain groups from using early detection services. To promote early detection of breast cancer among an estimated 67,000 medically underserved women aged greater than or equal to 40 years, the Early Detection Program (EDP) was begun in Dade County, Florida, in the fall of 1987 (1). This report summarizes the progress of the program for September 1987 through March 1991. 
Outcome of infants and children with dilated cardiomyopathy. A review of 81 infants and children with dilated, poorly contracting left ventricles without associated structural abnormalities was undertaken to identify risk factors for poor outcome, which could be used in selecting candidates for cardiac transplantation. Significant atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias, or both, were detected on presentation or during follow-up in 24 patients. Arrhythmias were present in only 8 of 51 survivors (16%) but were detected in 16 of 30 patients (53%) who died (p less than 0.05). Patients dying suddenly were even more likely to have had documented dysrhythmias (8 of 11, p less than 0.05). Left ventricular shortening fraction was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors (14.9 +/- 1.0% vs 15.3 +/- 1.7%). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in 44 patients who had cardiac catheterization averaged 20.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in patients who died than in those who survived (29.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Analysis of actuarial survival revealed that mortality was highest during the first 6 months after presentation (19% mortality). Survival declined more gradually thereafter and was 70% at 2 years, 64% at 5 years and 52% after 11.5 years. Age at initial presentation did not have any significant impact on survival. However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 25 torr was associated with a significantly increased mortality rate (p less than 0.05). Early cardiac transplantation should be considered in patients with markedly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or complex atrial or ventricular arrhythmias. 
Inner ear damage secondary to diabetes mellitus. I. Changes in adolescent SHR/N-cp rats. The association between diabetes mellitus and hearing impairment has been debated in many previous studies. The spontaneous hypertensive/NIH-corpulent (SHR/N-cp) rat has been shown to be a unique genetic model for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Seventeen diabetic and 17 control young male rats were divided into groups according to diet and phenotype. The rats were fed either 54% of sucrose or 54% starch diets for 3.5 months and killed at 5 months. The cochleas were fixed, decalcified, dissected, and stained for hair cell counting. A significant loss of outer hair cells was noted in the diabetic obese (SHR/N-cp) animals when compared with the control obese (LA/N-cp) animals in every group. Although no significant difference was noted between the diabetic obese (SHR/N-cp) animals receiving the starch and sugar diets, the diabetic obese (SHR/N-cp) animals were more severely affected than the nondiabetic lean (SHR/N-cp) rats. 
Cortical benzodiazepine receptor binding in patients with generalized and partial epilepsy. Impaired cortical inhibition may be involved in epileptogenic mechanisms. In a positron-emission tomography (PET) study, we demonstrated a reduction of the cortical benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor density in the epileptic foci of patients with partial epileptic seizures. In the present study, we used the same method in 10 patients with primary generalized epilepsy to determine whether an altered BZD receptor binding could also be demonstrated in this patient group. The [11C]-labeled BZD receptor antagonist Ro 15-1788 was used as ligand. Receptor affinities and densities were calculated in various cortical regions and then compared with the values from corresponding "nonepileptic" regions in the previously examined partial epilepsy patients. Focal alterations of the BZD receptor density or affinity were not demonstrated in patients with generalized epilepsy. This patient group had a slight tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density, however, as compared with corresponding values from 10 patients with partial epilepsy. Our results strongly suggest that a focal alteration of cortical inhibition is not a prominent feature of human generalized epilepsy. The observed tendency toward lower mean cortical BZD receptor density may be a consequence of diffusely impaired cortical inhibition. Further investigations of this issue are therefore indicated. 
Synthesis and evaluation of new iodine-125 radiopharmaceuticals as potential tracers for malignant melanoma. The synthesis, labeling, and biodistribution of four 125I radiopharmaceuticals designed to localize in melanoma were tested. Uptake in tumors was demonstrated by autoradiography of whole-body sections and quantitated by measurement of radioactivity of selected tissues and tumors using melanoma-bearing mice. N-(2-diethylaminoethyl)-4-iodobenzamide was selected for its highest melanoma uptake: 60 min after IV injection of 6.5% and 4% ID/g, respectively for murine B16 and human melanotic melanoma. Tumor uptake showed the highest values of all analyzed tissues from 6 to 24 hr after injection. High uptake in melanotic tumor tissue with relatively low uptake in blood, muscle, brain, lung, and liver tissue resulted in high tumor/nontumor ratios (at 24 hr for B16, tumor/blood = 37, tumor/brain = 147, tumor/muscle = 95). This agent was compared with iodoamphetamine. Scintigraphic images of the tumor confirmed that external detection of melanoma is possible with this new radiopharmaceutical. 
Choledocholithiasis in acute gallstone pancreatitis. Incidence and clinical significance. A prospective study of choledocholithiasis was performed using 110 patients with presumptive diagnoses of acute gallstone pancreatitis. The incidence of migrating and persistent bile duct stones was determined using stool screening and intraoperative cholangiography, and the clinical significance of continued stone obstruction of the papilla was investigated using ultrasound assessment of migration time and a second evaluation of prognostic signs. Pancreatic inflammation was confirmed at surgery in 51 patients, of whom only 27 had stones in the stools (n = 22) or the bile duct (n = 5), suggesting that choledocholithiasis may not be the sole triggering factor of acute gallstone pancreatitis. Neither delayed migration nor persistent stone obstruction of the papilla promoted pancreatic inflammation. 
Dissecting aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The authors present three cases of dissecting aneurysms of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA). A literature search revealed only three previous cases. Analysis of these six cases showed a unique clinical picture. Three patients developed subarachnoid hemorrhage, and the other three had ischemia. All patients complained of occipital headache or neck pain, regardless of the initial symptoms. Heralding episodes were recorded in four cases. Angiography showed a characteristic fusiform dilatation of the PICA and a narrowing proximal to and distal to the lesion. Various surgical treatments were performed in five cases. Intraoperative observation showed a sausage-like swelling of the PICA or one of its branches with various discoloration depending on the age of the intramural clot. The outcomes were favorable. 
Interference between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep in near miss SIDS. GER may be considered as one of the triggering factors in some apparently life-threatening events or even SIDS. Also at the present time, many teams perform 24-h pH monitoring in at-risk infants and treat those with abnormal scores. However, further investigations are needed to answer the question: Which unknown additional factor(s) is present when a specific episode of GER causes apnea and/or bradycardia either during sleep or wakefulness?. 
Stromal osseous metaplasia in carcinoma of the bladder. Osseous metaplasia of the stroma of carcinomas of the bladder is a rare finding that must be distinguished from osteosarcoma and carcinosarcoma. We report a case of multifocal osseous metaplasia in a high grade urothelial carcinoma with extensive glandular differentiation, arising in the base of the bladder of an 84-year-old man. Reports of 11 other cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in primary bladder carcinomas and of 5 cases of stromal osseous metaplasia in metastases of bladder carcinoma are reviewed. 
Effects of interferon-gamma therapy on thyroid function, T-lymphocyte subpopulations and induction of autoantibodies. Treatment with human leucocyte interferon (IFN alpha) has been associated with the development of thyroid autoimmunity and hypothyroidism, but it is not certain whether this phenomenon was a result of contamination with IFN gamma, which induced HLA class II antigen expression on T-lymphocytes. We prospectively studied 11 subjects (5 females and 6 males; mean age, 26.8 yr; range, 18-36) with chronic active hepatitis B who were randomized to receive recombinant human IFN gamma (rhIFN gamma; 10(6) U/m2.day, im, 3 times/week) for 16 weeks. Goiter was not present, and no patient had a history or family history of autoimmune diseases. Serial thyroid functions, including serum T4, T3, free thyroid hormone index, free T4 and TSH before, during, and on subsequent follow-up for a period of 1 yr were all normal. Eight patients had adequate serial samples for study of serological and lymphocyte subpopulations. None of the patients treated with rhIFN gamma developed thyroglobulin or thyroid microsomal antibodies. However, four patients developed antinuclear and smooth muscle autoantibodies during or after rhIFN gamma treatment. Treatment with rhIFN gamma resulted in a significant increase in circulating T-lymphocytes and HLA-DR-positive T-cells (P less than 0.05), with equal proportions of circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells becoming DR positive. The percentage of HLA-DR-positive T-cells remained elevated after discontinuation of rhIFN gamma. Also, rhIFN gamma treatment led to a decrease in the number of circulating granulocytes and interleukin-2 receptor-positive cells. In conclusion, we did not observe any thyroid dysfunction or thyroid autoimmunity in our patients treated with the studied dose of rhIFN gamma, but induction of other autoantibodies was observed. 
Pericardial mass mimicking constrictive pericarditis. Persistent pericardial hematoma due to blunt chest trauma is extremely rare. We report a case of constricted myocardium resulting from a large, partially organized hematoma in the right cardiophrenic angle. The hematoma was assumed to be caused by an occupational accident 17 years before diagnosis. Constriction could only be controlled by complete removal of the fibrous posterior capsule of the hematoma, which covered the epicardium of the right heart. 
The effect of an extra-articular procedure on allograft reconstructions for chronic ruptures of the anterior cruciate ligament. A study was performed on the effect of the addition of an extra-articular procedure involving tenodesis of the iliotibial band to a reconstruction with a bone-patellar ligament-bone allograft for the treatment of chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament. One hundred and four patients were divided into two groups for comparison: Group 1 (sixty-four patients) was treated with only an intra-articular replacement with an allograft and Group 2 (forty patients), with both an intra-articular replacement with an allograft and the extra-articular procedure. Preoperatively, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of twenty variables, including body weight, level of activity, anterior-posterior displacements, number of previous operations, and duration of follow-up. All of the patients returned for follow-up evaluation twenty-three to fifty-four months (mean, thirty-five months) postoperatively. All were treated with the same postoperative program of immediate motion of the knee and rehabilitation. The results were evaluated with the use of a comprehensive subjective and objective system that rated the twenty factors. Both procedures proved to be effective in decreasing functional limitations and symptoms and in improving the level of sports activity and the over-all scores. The results in Group 2 were significantly better than those in Group 1, as measured with tests done with the KT-1000 arthrometer (p less than 0.01) and with regard to the level of sports activity (p less than 0.05) and the over-all scores (p less than 0.01). There was no postoperative difference between the two groups in terms of the results on pivot-shift or isokinetic testing, patellofemoral crepitus, functional limitations, or symptoms. The program of rehabilitation effectively restored 0 to 135 degrees of motion to all but four knees, which lacked 5 degrees of extension at the most recent follow-up. The over-all rate of failure for both groups was 11 per cent. However, the rate of failure was 16 per cent (ten of sixty-four knees) in Group 1 and only 3 per cent (one of forty knees) in Group 2. This difference was significant (p less than 0.05). The extra-articular procedure appeared to provide support to the healing intra-articular allograft by reducing deleterious forces and tibial displacements, and to restore the secondary restraints provided by the lateral iliotibial band. The results suggest that the combination of the procedures is of value in young, athletically active people who have chronic rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Nasal administration of salmon calcitonin for prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in children with nephrosis. To determine the effect of intranasal administration of salmon calcitonin on glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in children with nephrosis, we gave 100 U of calcitonin intranasally on alternate days with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 to five children, 8 to 12 years of age, with frequently relapsing nephrosis. Four patients with osteoporosis, 10 to 14 years of age, were treated only with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and served as control subjects. Both groups were treated with an almost equal amount of glucocorticoids previously and during this study period. Bone mineral content of the spine was measured by a quantitative computed tomographic technique. The bone mineral content was preserved in both cortical and spongeous areas of the vertebrae during the 16-month period in the calcitonin-treated group but was decreased significantly in the control group. Urinary hydroxyproline and calcium excretion decreased significantly in the calcitonin-treated group. The serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations and the parathyroid function did not change significantly in either group. We conclude that calcitonin suppressed bone resorption and might be useful for the long-term treatment of osteoporosis, in combination with 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3, in children with nephrosis requiring long-term glucocorticoid therapy. 
Sudden unexpected death due to papillary fibroma of the aortic valve. Report of a case and review of the literature. The case of the sudden unexpected death of a 21-year-old man due to embolization of segments of an aortic valve papillary fibroma to the left main and anterior descending coronary artery is presented. The literature regarding cardiac papillary fibroma is reviewed with particular reference to those cases associated with sudden death. 
Adrenergic regulation of (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in proximal tubules of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Increased renal nerve activity and sodium retention have been implicated in the development of hypertension in genetically transmitted forms of this disease. The present studies were designed to investigate the relationship between renal nerve integrity and renal proximal tubule (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity of basolateral membranes (BLMs) enriched from proximal tubules of five-week-old SHR was greater, 328.6 +/- 18.9 nmol Pi/mg protein.min, than in age-matched genetic controls rats (Wistar-Kyoto, WKY, rats), 262.3 +/- 34.6 nmol Pi/mg protein.min (P less than 0.02). There was no detectable difference in (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity of 13-week-old SHR and WKY rats. Prior renal denervation was associated with a reduction in proximal tubule basolateral membrane (BLM) (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity, 316.8 +/- 23.8 to 223.1 +/- 23.9 nmol Pi/mg protein/min (P less than 0.02), in five-week SHR. However, denervation had no effect on renal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in either WKY rats, nor did sham-denervation in SHR. In addition, exogenous norepinephrine, 1 microM, produced a more pronounced stimulation of (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in basolateral membranes from SHR as opposed to WKY controls (40.2% vs. 28.7%). Therefore, renal nerve integrity and exogenous catecholamines have a greater stimulatory influence on proximal tubule (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity in the early stages (prior to 5 weeks) of the development of hypertension in SHR than in age-matched WKY rats. 
Postmortem studies of the heart in three fatal cases of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To examine the hearts of individuals who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan, with particular attention paid to the coronary arteries, the neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart because of reported terminal disturbances of cardiac rhythm and conduction. STUDY MATERIAL: Three hearts fixed in neutral formalin and well preserved with all the relevant areas of conduction system intact. METHODS: Light microscopic examination of subserial sections of the sinus node, atrioventricular node and His bundle, coronary chemoreceptor and regional nerves, ganglia, and small coronary arteries. Routine stains used were Goldner trichrome and Verhoeff-van Gieson. RESULTS: Arterial abnormalities were numerous and primarily of two types: focal fibromuscular dysplasia causing moderate to severe narrowing, as well as endarteritis and panarteritis. Extensive examples of neuritis and ganglionitis were present throughout the heart, including the conduction system, where arterial abnormalities were also abundant. In the coronary chemoreceptor there were both old and new lesions comprising focal inflammation with degeneration as well as older areas of fibrotic destruction. Within the sinus node, areas of dense fibrosis replaced all nodal tissue. These abnormalities were similar in nature and extent in all three hearts. CONCLUSIONS: The pathologic lesions present in the coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system of the heart in patients who died from the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome provide a suitable anatomic substrate for substantial cardiac electrical instability, including the occurrence of sudden death. In cases of unexplained cardiac electrical instability or sudden unexpected death an inquiry should be made about previous use of L-tryptophan. In patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, the possibility of cardiac electrical instability should be considered as part of long-range clinical management. 
Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, beta-thromboglobulin, and fibrinopeptide A before, during, and after treatment of acute myocardial infarction with alteplase. Plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), beta-thromboglobulin (beta TG), and fibrinopeptide A (FPA) were followed over 24 hours in 30 patients treated with alteplase for acute myocardial infarction. Samples were taken at baseline (T Oh), after 90 minutes (under alteplase, no heparin, T 1.5h), after 120 minutes (under alteplase and heparin, T 2h), 30 minutes after thrombolytic therapy (T 3.5h), as well as 12 hours (T 12h) and 24 hours (T 24h) after baseline. PAI-1 antigen levels (55 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh, mean +/- SEM) decreased to 35 +/- 5 (T 1.5h) and 40 +/- 6 (T 2h) ng/mL under alteplase, before increasing to 84 +/- 22 (T 3.5h), 130 +/- 30 (T 12h), and 64 +/- 7 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy, P less than .001. A high baseline PAI-1 activity (18 +/- 3 ng/mL) decreased to 2.0 +/- 0.4 (T 1.5h) and 1.7 +/- 0.2 (T 2h) under alteplase and increased to 32 +/- 5 (T 12h) and 19 +/- 3 (T 24h) ng/mL after therapy (P less than .0001). beta TG levels (339 +/- 105 ng/mL at T Oh) decreased to 203 +/- 48 (T 2h), 154 +/- 51 (T 3.5h), 187 +/- 40 (T 12h), and 142 +/- 32 (T 24h) ng/mL under heparin (P less than .01). FPA levels (34 +/- 9 ng/mL at T Oh) increased to 85 +/- 15 ng/mL under alteplase alone (T 1.5h) and normalized under heparin (11 +/- 4, 6 +/- 2, 4 +/- 2, and 3 +/- 1 ng/mL at T 2h, T 3.5h, T 12h, and T 24h, respectively). A high level of FPA at T 3.5h correlated with reocclusion (33 +/- 12 ng/mL, n = 4 v 2.9 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, n = 21, P less than .005). We conclude that plasma levels of PAI-1 antigen as well as activity markedly increase after alteplase therapy of acute myocardial infarction. The high activity of PAI-1 and decreasing beta TG levels suggest that platelets do not contribute significantly to this phenomenon. The marked increase of FPA levels under recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator alone and its normalization under heparin emphasize the important role of concomitant anticoagulation in controlling further intravasal fibrin generation under alteplase. 
Coupling between the heart and arterial system in heart failure. A number of experimental studies have demonstrated the optimal coupling between the ventricle and arterial load, under physiologic and pathologic circumstances, directed to produce maximal stroke work. We investigated matching of the ventricular properties, quantified by the slope of end-systolic pressure-volume relationship, with arterial load properties, expressed by the slope of end-systolic pressure-stroke volume relationship. In normal subjects, with ejection fraction of greater than or equal to 60%, ventricular elastance was nearly twice as large as arterial elastance. This condition affords maximal mechanical efficiency. In patients with moderate heart failure, with ejection fraction of 40-59%, ventricular elastance was almost equal to arterial elastance. This condition affords maximal stroke work from a given end-diastolic volume. In patients with severe heart failure, with ejection fraction of less than 40%, ventricular elastance was less than half of arterial elastance, which resulted in increased potential energy and decreased work efficiency. Ventriculoarterial coupling is normally set toward higher left ventricular work efficiency, whereas in patients with moderate cardiac dysfunction, ventricular and arterial properties are matched, in order to maximize stroke work at the expense of work efficiency. Neither the stroke work nor work efficiency is near maximum for patients with severe cardiac dysfunction. 
Nutrition and metabolism in sepsis and multisystem organ failure. Sepsis and organ failure produce profound metabolic changes that contribute to hepatic and musculoskeletal failure. When multiple organ failure develops, the mortality rate is high, and therapy is unlikely to be effective unless the causative process (e.g., infection, low cardiac output) can be eliminated. Thus, the prevention of multiple organ failure and the prevention or early treatment of infection are paramount. Organ and nutritional support to prevent complications is necessary. The gastrointestinal tract should be used for nutrition whenever possible with a blenderized regular diet with fiber, glutamine, and short-chain fatty acids to protect and preserve the gut. If parenteral nutrition is necessary, special solutions may be necessary for the liver, kidneys, or lungs. If not, protein with 45% branched-chain amino acid, medium- and short-chain triglycerides, glutamine supplementation, and carbohydrates seem best. Other substances are being evaluated that may be helpful in nutrition and organ support, including arginine, xylitol, growth hormone, and anabolic steroids. Multiple organ failure should be prevented, if at all possible, by stopping or controlling the injury, removing as much necrotic tissue as possible, improving blood flow and oxygen consumption, supporting metabolism, and preventing infection or treating it early and adequately. Nutritional support plays a key role in preventing metabolic failure. 
Reducing postischemic paraplegia using conjugated superoxide dismutase. Paraplegia after thoracic aortic aneurysm repair has an incidence of 2.2% to 24%. Oxygen-derived free radicals after reperfusion of an ischemic spinal cord may be partly responsible for neuronal destruction. We studied the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), a free radical scavenger, as a way of increasing spinal cord tolerance to ischemia. Thirty rabbits underwent 40 minutes of aortic occlusion (a known model of paraplegia). Ten of these animals received 25,000 U/kg of PEG-SOD 24 hours before aortic occlusion and two additional doses of 10,000 U/kg, one before and one subsequent to spinal ischemia. Ten animals received superoxide dismutase in the same dosages as those receiving PEG-SOD. Ten control animals received placebo. All animals were studied for 96 hours, at which time a final neurological examination was performed and the results were recorded. Of the 10 animals treated with PEG-SOD, 2 were completely paralyzed whereas 8 had less (7) or no (1) neurological impairment. Eight of the 10 control animals and 9 of the 10 animals receiving superoxide dismutase were completely paralyzed. None of the control animals or animals receiving superoxide dismutase had a normal neurological examination (p less than or equal to 0.05). Treatment with PEG-SOD before and during occlusion increased the rabbit spinal cord tolerance to a 40-minute ischemic insult. Scavenging free radicals may lessen experimental spinal cord injury. 
Staple closure of the hypopharynx after diverticulectomy and total laryngectomy. The use of stapling devices to close hypopharyngeal defects was first published in 1969 but the technique does not seem to have gained much popularity among head and neck surgeons. Fifty-nine hypopharyngeal defects were closed using a linear stapler between January, 1984, and April, 1989, at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Zurich. Twenty closures were performed following resection of hypopharyngeal diverticula, 39 following wide field laryngectomy. A total of 10 salivary fistulae was observed: 2 after diverticulectomy (10%), 3 after laryngectomy in nonirradiated patients (11%), and 5 after laryngectomy in irradiated patients (45%). These fistula rates are comparable with average rates quoted in the literature. Only after laryngectomy for radiation failure was the fistula rate unusually high. No other complications were seen that could have been attributed to this type of pharyngeal closure. Closure of a hypopharyngeal defect with a stapler is easier and faster than with traditional suture methods. Provided the patient has not been previously irradiated, staple closure of the hypopharynx appears to be as reliable as closure by standard techniques and can be safely recommended. 
Role for tumor necrosis factor as mediator of lung injury following lower torso ischemia. Ischemia and reperfusion of the ischemic lower torso lead to a neutrophil- (PMN) dependent lung injury characterized by PMN sequestration and permeability edema. This mimics the injury seen after infusion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), a potent activator of PMN and endothelium. This study tests whether TNF is a mediator of the lung injury after lower torso ischemia. Anesthetized rats underwent 4 h of bilateral hindlimb tourniquet ischemia, followed by reperfusion for 10 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h (n = 6 for each time point). Quantitative lung histology indicated progressive sequestration of PMN in the lungs, 25 +/- 3 (SE) PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) 10 min after reperfusion vs. 20 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (NS), increasing to 53 +/- 5 PMN/10 HPF after 4 h vs. 23 +/- 3 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (P less than 0.01). There was lung permeability, shown by increasing protein accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, which 4 h after reperfusion was 599 +/- 91 vs. 214 +/- 35 micrograms/ml in sham animals (P less than 0.01). Similarly, there was edema, shown by the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, which increased by 4 h to 4.70 +/- 0.12 vs. 4.02 +/- 0.17 in sham animals (P less than 0.01). There was generation of leukotriene B4 in BAL fluid (720 +/- 140 vs. 240 +/- 40 pg/ml, P less than 0.01), and in three of six rats tested at this time TNF was detected in plasma, with a mean value of 167 pg/ml. TNF was not detectable in any sham animal. 
Anaesthesia for a patient with giant axonal neuropathy. Giant axonal neuropathy is a generalised disorder of cytoplasmic intermediate filaments which particularly involves the peripheral and central nervous systems. In this paper we describe a child with giant axonal neuropathy and discuss the anaesthetic management in the light of the pathology and physiology of the condition. 
Distribution of thymic tissue in the mediastinal adipose tissue. The distribution of thymic tissue in the anterior mediastinal, retrocarinal, and preaortic fat was examined histologically in 27 autopsy subjects. Thymic tissue was found in the anterior mediastinal fat in 12 subjects (44.4%), in the retrocarinal fat in two (7.4%), and in the preaortic fat in none. The finding of ectopic thymic tissue in these areas has not been reported previously, would appear to be surgically inaccessible via a median sternotomy, and may be responsible in part for some of the failures of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis. 
Jaundice and cholestasis. Some common and uncommon causes. Jaundiced patients may not always be as sick as they look, and cholestatic patients may be quite ill but not yet jaundiced. There is variability in presentation of cholestasis, and jaundice may be intrahepatic or extrahepatic and acute or chronic. Even though the diagnosis of jaundice can be elusive, an unnecessarily exhaustive search for a cause should be avoided, because some tests are not without dangers. Dr Gordon describes many possible causes, some of which are rare but are still worth consideration. 
Colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis. Influence of anatomical extent and age at onset on colitis-cancer interval. We have examined the age at onset of both ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer in 100 patients seen at Mount Sinai Hospital between 1959 and 1988. There were 85 patients with extensive colitis and 15 with left sided colitis. There was a strong direct correlation between the age at onset of ulcerative colitis and age at diagnosis of cancer (p less than 0.0001); this correlation was found both in patients with extensive colitis (p less than 0.0001) and in those with left sided colitis (p less than 0.005). Patients with left sided colitis developed both their colitis and their cancers about a decade later than did those with extensive disease, but the mean duration of colitis before diagnosis of cancer was virtually the same (about 21 years) in both groups, irrespective of the age at onset of disease. 
Bilateral chylothorax. A 2.5-kg female developed bilateral chylothoraces 10 days after surgery for coarctation of the aorta. Initial conservative management consisted of intermittent positive pressure ventilation, drainage of chylous fluid and enteral feeding, but there was no diminution in loss of chyle. Ligation of the thoracic duct and pleurectomy were performed subsequently to reduce the large daily losses of chyle, amounting to nearly three times the child's circulating blood volume. Brawny oedema of the right upper quadrant of the body developed rapidly after the duct ligation and right pleurectomy. A further period of conservative treatment was required before the latter complication resolved. The literature relating to this iatrogenic complication and to fluid and nutritional losses in paediatric chylothorax is reviewed and discussed. 
Diagnosis and treatment of headache in the elderly. The diagnosis and management of some causes of headache in the elderly are reviewed. Etiologic theories have been presented for each condition. Treatment modalities include pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and surgical therapies. The treatment course set forth in this article can help the clinician provide proper relief for the patient in pain. 
Congenitally corrected transposition and Ebstein's anomaly of the systemic atrioventricular valve: association with aortic arch obstruction. Aortic arch abnormalities are uncommon in patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries. Over a 20-year period, 10 patients with congenitally corrected transposition and Ebstein's anomaly of the systemic atrioventricular (AV) valve were identified. Five neonates had severe systemic AV valve regurgitation with severe coarctation of the aorta (n = 4) or aortic atresia (n = 1) and presented with heart failure. Four died in the neonatal period and one who had coarctation repair died 7 months postoperatively. The remaining five patients with congenitally corrected transposition and Ebstein's anomaly had mild left AV valve regurgitation; none of these had aortic arch obstruction. In neonates who have coexisting Ebstein's anomaly of the systemic AV valve and congenitally corrected transposition, obstruction to aortic arch flow is common. Severe systemic AV valve regurgitation with a morphologic systemic right ventricle may have contributed to low anterograde flow in the ascending aorta prenatally and thereby to the aortic arch abnormality. 
Adenocarcinoma: an unusual presentation. A young pregnant woman had facial swelling in the upper nasal region. This was initially considered to be lymphedema in view of a history of past severe facial acne. A biopsy was done when the lesion progressed; the specimen showed adenocarcinoma. This responded well to radiotherapy, the favorable response being maintained for more than 24 months. 
Indications for modification of coexisting dual atrioventricular node pathways in patients undergoing surgical ablation of accessory atrioventricular connections Concomitant susceptibility to atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia has been demonstrated in certain patients having reentrant tachycardia utilizing accessory AV connections. For those patients undergoing accessory connection ablation, AV node surgical modification may be warranted during the same operative procedure. To assess indications for a combined operative procedure, this study evaluated potential predictors of subsequent spontaneous AV node reentrant tachycardia in patients undergoing ablation of accessory AV connections. Among 62 consecutive patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection, 13 (21%) manifested dual AV node pathways. The latter were identified preoperatively in five patients (four with concealed and one with bidirectional accessory connections) and postoperatively in seven (all seven with bidirectional accessory connections). In one patient with a bidirectional accessory connection, dual AV node pathways could not be demonstrated preoperatively, but AV node reentrant tachycardia was induced. Operative ablation of an accessory connection was successful in all patients. However, postoperatively, 2 of the 13 patients had inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia, 5 had AV node "echo" beats and 6 had no inducible arrhythmia. During 26 +/- 7 months of follow-up study, the two patients with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia postoperatively had symptomatic AV node reentrant tachycardia. In addition, the one patient with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia preoperatively had recurrence of this tachycardia 4 months after attempted surgical modification of the AV node. Consequently, although dual AV node pathways appear to be common in patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection (21%), only a small group (3 of 13) of these patients are at risk for subsequent clinical AV node reentrant tachycardia. 
Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity following duodenal ulcer healing with omeprazole, sucralfate, and Maalox. Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity (PCS) have been studied in 21 duodenal ulcer patients before and after successful treatment with omeprazole (n = 7), sucralfate (n = 7), or Maalox (n = 7). The second study was carried out 3 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the sucralfate- and Maalox-treated groups and 14 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the omeprazole-treated patients. Acid output (mmol/hour) was measured as basal secretion, and in response to 0.1 microgram/kg/hour pentagastrin (low-dose) and 6.0 micrograms/kg/hour pentagastrin (high-dose) stimulation. PCS was calculated as the ratio of low dose:high dose acid output (expressed as a percentage). Ulcer healing with sucralfate resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in low-dose acid output from 36.4% (13.2-51.0) (median [range]) to 8.4% (3.2-45.4) mmol/hour and PCS from 69.1% (44.9-91.4) to 22.0% (16.0-85.6), whereas no significant decreases in any of the measured parameters were noted following ulcer healing with Maalox. Ulcer healing with omeprazole resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in basal acid output from 6.3 (1.5-22.9) (median [range]) to 2.2 (0-6.9) mmol/hour, and low-dose acid output from 31.0 (6.0-58.0) to 23.0 (1.4-44.8) mmol/hour. These findings suggest that acid secretory responses following ulcer healing vary according to the therapeutic agent used. 
Patients with duodenitis have gastric secretory and motor functions like those of duodenal ulcer patients: results of a short-term treatment with ranitidine. Gastric acid secretion, gastric emptying of solids, and the effects of short-term treatment with 300 mg ranitidine at bedtime were evaluated in symptomatic patients with endoscopically and histologically proven duodenitis. The patients investigated had basal and pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid hypersecretion, but normal gastric emptying times. Ranitidine brought about a significant improvement of endoscopic and histological features compared with the pretreatment findings. Endoscopic but not histological improvement was significantly better than with placebo. Furthermore, ranitidine brought about a significant reduction of weekly antacid consumption compared with placebo. Both ranitidine and placebo induced significant symptomatic improvement over basal conditions, but the difference between the two treatments did not reach statistical significance. Gastric secretory and motor functions, as well as the response to therapy, were similar in duodenitis patients with and without previous history of duodenal ulcer; the only exception was in antacid consumption, which was higher in the placebo group in those with past evidence of ulcer disease. Our results suggest that duodenitis patients have secretory and motor functions similar to those of duodenal ulcer patients. Therefore, further trials on large populations of duodenitis patients with antisecretory drugs are justified. 
Differential effects of heptanol, potassium, and tetrodotoxin on reentrant ventricular tachycardia around a fixed obstacle in anisotropic myocardium BACKGROUND. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that electrical uncoupling and depression of the fast sodium channels have differential effects on propagation of the electrical impulse relative to the fiber orientation. METHODS AND RESULTS. In a model of reentrant ventricular tachycardia (VT) (mean cycle length, 144 +/- 13 msec) around a ring of anisotropic myocardium in 10 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, the effects of extracellular K+ concentration [( K+]o) and heptanol were studied. [K+]o and heptanol each had a dose-dependent effect on VT cycle length. However, high [K+]o slowed the VT mainly by depressing longitudinal conduction, whereas heptanol preferentially depressed transverse conduction. The ratio between longitudinal and transverse conduction velocities progressively decreased with high [K+]o and progressively increased with heptanol. Heptanol terminated VT at a mean concentration of 3.5 +/- 0.5 mM. The cycle length before termination was 446 +/- 120 msec (p less than 0.001). In eight of 10 experiments, termination occurred by failure of conduction during transverse propagation. VT terminated at a mean [K+]o of 11.6 +/- 1.8 mM. The cycle length before termination was 493 +/- 341 msec (p less than 0.01). In seven of 10 cases, termination occurred by failure of conduction during longitudinal propagation. In the remaining five episodes (two with heptanol and three with high [K+]o), termination occurred by collision of the reentrant beat with an antidromic impulse being reflected within the ring. In a separate series of six hearts, tetrodotoxin was administered during VT. Like high [K+]o, tetrodotoxin prolonged the cycle length of the VT by preferentially slowing longitudinal conduction, and VT was terminated by longitudinal block. CONCLUSIONS. During reentrant VT, electrical uncoupling of cells by heptanol or modification of active membrane properties by high [K+]o or tetrodotoxin has a differential depressing effect on propagation of the impulse relative to the fiber orientation. 
Effects of alterations in pulmonary function and sleep variables on survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Breathing abnormalities and nocturnal hypoventilation occur in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). A prospective study was undertaken to determine the relationship of pulmonary function test abnormalities with quality of sleep and survival in 21 patients with ALS. Results of spirometry including determination of maximal respiratory pressures and arterial blood gases were compared with several formal polysomnographic variables and then also with 18-month survival. The patients had mild to moderate pulmonary function deficits, but the quality of sleep was best related to age (mean age, 58.5 years). The results of pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas measurements did not correlate well with the presence of nocturnal breathing events or survival time, but the maximal inspiratory pressure was 86% sensitive for predicting the presence of a nocturnal oxygen saturation nadir of 80% or less and 100% sensitive for predicting 18-month survival. Although obstructive breathing events occurred, the primary explanation for the decline in nocturnal oxygen saturation was hypoventilation. We conclude that routine pulmonary function tests may be useful for screening for reductions in nocturnal oxygen saturation and also may have prognostic value. Further studies may determine whether treatment of nocturnal hypoventilation will have an effect on survival in patients with ALS who have breathing impairment. 
Transition of Ki-67 index of uterine cervical tumors during radiation therapy. Immunohistochemical study. Histopathologic and Ki-67-staining features of cancer cells were investigated in biopsy specimens before and during radiation therapy in 29 patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma. No morphologic changes were observed up to doses of 540 cGy. A few intact cancer cells remained up to doses of 2700 cGy. Moderate changes in the cancer cells were noticed in patients who received 900 cGy or more, i.e., multinuclei, swollen nuclei and cytoplasms, and prominent large nucleoli. At doses of 1800 cGy or greater, many cancer nests had severely damaged cancer cells with features such as cytolysis, karyolysis, karyorrhexis, pyknosis, and bizarre giant cells. There was no mitosis in the cells of patients who received doses greater than 1800 cGy. The Ki-67-positive cancer cells showed diffuse nuclear-stainings and dot-stainings before radiation therapy. Radiation doses more than 900 cGy changed the staining pattern of the Ki-67 antibody; large irregular spot-stainings and ring-stainings were observed predominantly. The Ki-67 index initially increased with the radiation dose; the mean Ki-67 indices before radiation therapy and at radiation doses of 180 cGy, 540 cGy, and 900 cGy were 41%, 50%, 63%, and 68%, respectively. The indices decreased when the dose was increased further, and they were 39% and 20% at doses of 1800 cGy and 2700 cGy, respectively. Possible explanations, including recruitment of quiescent cells, for the change in Ki-67 staining are discussed. 
Posterior fossa intracranial hemorrhage in infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: sonographic findings. Posterior fossa hemorrhage was documented by autopsy in five infants who had been treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation over a 5-year-period. In all five cases, the diagnosis was made prospectively by cranial sonography. Sonographic findings were compared with those in a control group of 15 infants with normal posterior fossae at autopsy. The following sonographic abnormalities were exhibited in neonates with posterior fossae hemorrhage: loss of definition of the cerebellum and fourth ventricle on midline sagittal images, heterogeneous cerebellar parenchyma, focal hypoechoic lesions, ventricular dilatation, and tentorial abnormalities. Bright foci inferior to the third ventricle were seen in four neonates in the normal control group. These foci measured 5-10 mm in diameter. One cranial sonogram was falsely interpreted as showing a posterior fossa hemorrhage because of prominent echoes in the interpeduncular cistern. Infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation are at risk for developing posterior fossa hemorrhage. Awareness of sonographic signs and potential pitfalls in the interpretation of posterior fossa hemorrhage is important for early and accurate recognition of these unusual and sometimes treatable hemorrhages. 
Positive role of Clostridium difficile infection in diarrhea in infants and children. A retrospective review of children with Clostridium difficile infection and diarrhea identified 43 patients. Fifteen (35%) had immunoglobulins below the normal range for age, and typified those with transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, because all increased their levels over the following 12 months. The age of those with hypogammaglobulinemia was significantly younger (p less than 0.01), averaging 18.8 months, than those with normal immunoglobulins who had a mean age of 4.6 yr. The number with recurrent C. difficile infection was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) in the hypogammaglobulinemic group than in those with normal immunoglobulins (46% vs 18%). Eleven children were identified who had C. difficile toxin in the stool after antibiotic therapy, but who had no diarrhea at the time of study. All had normal immunoglobulins. Control patients (20 without and 40 with diarrhea) had no evidence of C. difficile infection, and all but three had normal immunoglobulins. Three (7%) of those with diarrhea had IgA deficiency, and all had a diagnosis of milk protein allergy. These data suggest that immunoglobulin values be obtained in infants and children who have problematic C. difficile diarrhea in order to identify disorders of immunoglobulin synthesis which may be the underlying cause of repeated upper respiratory disease requiring antibiotic usage. 
Variable regression of experimental bronchial preneoplasia during carcinogenesis. It has been thought that squamous severe atypical metaplasia of the bronchus is reliably precancerous. The canine subcutaneous bronchial autograft model for studying the progression of epidermoid carcinogenesis (normal----regular squamous metaplasia----mild, moderate, and severe atypical metaplasia----squamous cell carcinoma) provides evidence that severe atypical metaplasia of the bronchial epithelium is reversible. Among 148 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had serial sampling of the epithelium and exposure to implants of methylcholanthrene, severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 28 that received only a single implant. During the total carcinogen exposure (median 24.5 months), 9 of 28 (32%) developed squamous cell cancer, and 19 of 28 (68%) regressed toward normal. Severe atypical metaplasia was noted in 34 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that received two or more carcinogen implants: epidermoid cancer developed in 26 of 34 (76.5%), and regression toward or to normal occurred in 8 of 34 (23.5%). Severe atypical metaplasia was not detected in 53 subcutaneous bronchial autografts: 19 that received only a single implant and 34 that received two or more implants. Progression and regression occurred among these subcutaneous bronchial autografts in proportions similar to those found in subcutaneous bronchial autografts wherein severe atypical metaplasia was seen. Among 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts initially studied after 6 months of exposure to carcinogen, progression to severe atypical metaplasia was seen 3 months later in 19 of 33 that had additional exposure; in the same interval regression of epithelial abnormalities occurred in 14 of 33 subcutaneous bronchial autografts that had no additional exposure (p less than 0.05). We have presented evidence that severe atypical metaplasia includes at least three cell populations: one committed to cancer without further stimulus, one that regresses despite further carcinogen exposure, and one that requires additional carcinogen to progress to cancer. At least in this model, severe atypical metaplasia is not inexorably precancerous. The subcutaneous bronchial autograft model is suitable for seeking biologic indicators of irreversibility. 
Spinal cord ischemia after resection of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms: MR findings in 24 patients. MR images of the thoracic spinal cord were made in 24 patients who developed signs and symptoms of spinal cord ischemia or infarction following surgery for a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Findings consisted primarily of four different patterns of signal abnormalities in the distribution of the anterior spinal artery. These abnormalities were identified as types A-D, depending on the degree of involvement of the gray matter and surrounding white matter. We found good correlation between the distribution of the signal abnormalities in the cord, the severity of the neurologic deficits, and the clinical outcome. MR is the imaging method of choice for diagnosing spinal cord ischemia or infarction. A thorough knowledge of the spinal cord arterial territories is crucial for characterizing ischemic MR signal abnormalities and for differentiating them from other causes of myelopathy. 
Predicting chemically induced duodenal ulcer and adrenal necrosis with classification trees. Binary tree-structured statistical classification algorithms and properties of 56 model alkyl nucleophiles were brought to bear on two problems of experimental pharmacology and toxicology. Each rat of a learning sample of 745 was administered one compound and autopsied to determine the presence of duodenal ulcer or adrenal hemorrhagic necrosis. The cited statistical classification schemes were then applied to these outcomes and 67 features of the compounds to ascertain those characteristics that are associated with biologic activity. For predicting duodenal ulceration, dipole moment, melting point, and solubility in octanol are particularly important, while for predicting adrenal necrosis, important features include the number of sulfhydryl groups and double bonds. These methods may constitute inexpensive but powerful ways to screen untested compounds for possible organ-specific toxicity. Mechanisms for the etiology and pathogenesis of the duodenal and adrenal lesions are suggested, as are additional avenues for drug design. 
Role of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in intraabdominal abscess formation in the rat. Our concept of the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis and advanced pelvic infection, such as tuboovarian abscess, is evolving. Although Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are thought to play a significant role in acute pelvic inflammatory disease, other microorganisms, such as aerobes and anaerobes, have repeatedly been reported to play a significant role, also, particularly in the patient with advanced disease. A study was designed to evaluate the pathogenesis, and particularly any synergistic role, of some aerobes and anaerobes with N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis abscess formation. Using the rat model developed by Weinstein and Onderdonk, the study demonstrated that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis alone do not produce abscesses. However, when combined with facultative or anaerobic bacteria, synergism with abscess formation is noted frequently. The data support the hypothesis that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis initiate infection and that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria act synergistically to produce abscesses. In addition, microorganisms not inoculated were found to be recruited into the infectious process. The organisms may gain access to the peritoneal cavity via the lower genital tract or from transmucosal migration from the intestinal flora. 
Effect of clonidine on gallbladder contraction and small bowel transit time in insulin-treated diabetics. Cholelithiasis is more prevalent in diabetics than in nondiabetics. Gallbladder dysmotility is supposed to be one of the causative factors. Reduced alpha-adrenergic tone has been demonstrated in the enterocytes of diabetic rats, and its correction by clonidine might explain the beneficial effect that the drug has on diabetic diarrhea. We therefore surmised that diabetic cholecystoparesis could also be due to alpha-adrenergic alterations. To test this hypothesis, we studied gallbladder contractions by real time ultrasonography, and small bowel transit time by lactulose hydrogen breath test, in 13 insulin-requiring diabetics before and after administration of the alpha-adrenergic stimulant clonidine (0.3 mg orally). That plasma levels were sufficient was evidenced indirectly by a fall in blood pressure. Clonidine significantly improved the rate of emptying (0.0193 +/- 0.00057/min vs. 0.0318 +/- 0.0027/min; p less than 0.005), but not the fasting and residual gallbladder volumes. Small bowel transit time was significantly prolonged after clonidine (169 +/- 17 min vs. 208 +/- 17; p less than 0.05). These results suggest that 1) reduced alpha-adrenergic tone corrected by clonidine may be present in the diabetic gallbladder, and 2) clonidine's antidiarrheal effect might be explained, at least in part, by a prolongation of the small bowel transit time. 
Relation between myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor and left ventricular function in patients with left ventricular volume overload due to chronic mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation. The relation between myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor and left ventricular (LV) function was studied in 10 patients, aged 41 to 61 years (average 51), with LV volume overload mainly due to chronic mitral regurgitation. Beta-adrenergic receptors were examined using crude membrane in LV papillary muscle obtained at mitral valve replacement. Cardiac function was evaluated at preoperative cardiac catheterization with the interval to surgery of 1 to 33 months (average 7). Beta-adrenergic receptor density in 7 patients with New York Heart Association class II or III congestive heart failure was higher than that in 3 patients with class IV heart failure (59 +/- 19 vs 37 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein, p less than 0.05). Beta-adrenergic receptor density showed a positive correlation with end-systolic stress/end-systolic volume index ratio, the index for contractile function (p less than 0.005). Other parameters such as cardiac index, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and LV ejection fraction had no significant correlation to beta-adrenergic receptor. The results demonstrated that increases in symptom and LV dysfunction, particularly of the contractile state, was associated with decreased myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density from possible down-regulation in patients with chronic mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation. 
Serum neuron-specific enolase levels after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We examined serum levels of neuron-specific enolase by enzyme immunoassay in 29 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured cerebral aneurysm. Serum neuron-specific enolase levels were significantly higher in patients with a poor neurological status than in patients with a good neurological status on admission, and the greater the amount of subarachnoid blood, the higher the serum neuron-specific enolase level. Patients with a good outcome had low serum neuron-specific enolase levels throughout their courses. Serum neuron-specific enolase levels increased with development of delayed ischemic neurological deficits and, especially in poor outcome patients, high levels persisted until 3 weeks after the subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Dopaminergic abnormalities in borderline essential hypertensive patients. To explore whether an altered metabolic pathway of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) may be related to some previously observed dopamine abnormalities in borderline hypertension, we measured basal and DOPA-induced (500 mg orally) changes in blood pressure and pulse rate as well as in three hourly plasma and urine samples. We found that borderline hypertensive patients compared with controls 1) showed a higher baseline urinary excretion of methoxytyramine, a marker of exocytotic dopamine release, with a greater DOPA-induced decrease of systolic blood pressure without reflex tachycardia; 2) had in response to DOPA a blunted plasma DOPA and free dopamine increase but an accentuated plasma dopamine sulfate and urinary DOPAC excretion; and 3) eliminated comparable quantities of dopamine in urine despite a lower rise in the glomerular DOPA load. Furthermore, although DOPA elicited natriuresis in both groups, its effect was greater in borderline hypertensive patients, who lacked the urinary sodium correlation with urinary dopamine excretion seen in control subjects. These data are compatible with increased basal exocytotic dopamine release and accelerated neuronal and renal (extraneuronal) dopamine generation from administered DOPA in borderline hypertension. The DOPA-induced hypernatriuresis exceeding augmented dopamine in borderline hypertensive patients, contrasting with the urinary sodium and dopamine correlation in control subjects, suggests that DOPA induced an additional natriuresis in borderline hypertensive patients by a decrease in renal sympathetic tone because of its central inhibition of sympathetic outflow, which also may account for the absence of reflex tachycardia. 
Amantadine toxicity presenting with complex ventricular ectopy and hallucinations. Amantadine hydrochloride is a commonly prescribed drug with a narrow therapeutic-to-toxic range. Toxicity is related to the anticholinergic properties of the drug and primarily affects the cardiovascular, central nervous, and respiratory systems. We report the case of an adolescent who ingested 1.3 grams of amantadine and developed complex ventricular arrhythmias and altered mental status. The arrhythmias were completely suppressed with intravenous lidocaine. This case supports the hypothesis that lidocaine is effective for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias secondary to amantadine toxicity. 
Flash lamp pumped dye laser for rosacea-associated telangiectasia and erythema. The persistence of facial telangiectasis and erythema in patients with rosacea frequently presents a major cosmetic problem. It may also contribute to relapses of papular and pustular lesions. This study of 27 patients treated for their telangiectasia and erythema with a flash lamp pumped dye laser tuned at 585 nm is described. The laser gave good or excellent reduction of telangiectasia and erythema and overall appearance in 24 of the patients with between one and three treatments. In addition, papule and pustule activity was decreased in 59.2% of the patients, with those with the most severe pre-treatment activity having the most significant improvement. It is suggested that this is a useful additional form of treatment that may improve the telangiectasia and erythematous component of rosacea. 
Testing the psychogenic vomiting diagnosis. Four pediatric patients. We treated four patients with chronic vomiting during childhood in whom a tentative diagnosis of psychogenic vomiting was made after an extensive evaluation. In each case, the diagnosis was reconsidered during the course of treatment, as observations about the patients and their response to interventions accumulated. In three instances, these observations did not fit those expected if the diagnosis of psychogenic vomiting was correct. This led to a reexamination of the organic evaluation and the discovery of an undiagnosed organic contribution to the vomiting. In the fourth patient, gastric emptying studies confirmed that there was a strong psychological contribution to the vomiting, and helped to more carefully define this contribution. Family and individual psychotherapy and treatment were aided by the greater clarity in diagnosis. 
Strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels in muscles from patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes. Intramuscular blood vessels were examined with succinate dehydrogenase stain in skeletal muscle biopsy specimens from 6 patients with mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). Almost all arteries had large granular deposits with high succinate dehydrogenase activity in their walls. Electron microscopic examination of serial frozen sections of these biopsies showed that the smooth muscle cells of the strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels contained markedly proliferated mitochondria, characteristic of patients with MELAS. The presence of strongly succinate dehydrogenase-reactive blood vessels in muscle biopsy specimens provides an important clue toward understanding the underlying pathogenetic mechanism in patients with MELAS as well as another approach to the diagnosis of this disorder. 
Study of human papillomavirus in oral epithelial dysplasia and epidermoid carcinoma in the absence of tobacco and alcohol use. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are implicated in the etiology of benign and malignant mucosal lesions in both human beings and animals. The oncogenic role of HPV in malignant cervical lesions is well supported by DNA hybridization techniques and epidemiologic studies. However, the role of HPV in oral epithelial dysplasia and epidermoid carcinoma remains speculative. In this study the in situ hybridization technique was used to detect HPV genotypes 6 and 11; 16 and 18; and 31, 33, and 35 in tissue specimens from a study group consisting of 18 patients who were non-tobacco users, or non-tobacco and non-alcohol users, in whom oral epithelial dysplasia and epidermoid carcinoma developed. The hybridization findings were compared with those of a comparable control group of patients with similar lesions who had a history of tobacco and alcohol use. None of the study group cases was reactive with any of the DNA probes. Two cases of the control group showed positive hybridization with HPV DNA probe types 6/11 and 16/18. The implications of these findings are presented and discussed in an attempt to clarify the role of HPV in HPV-associated oral epidermoid carcinomas. 
Abnormal responses to orthostatic testing in children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope. Syncope in the pediatric age group is a frequent event. Most often the cause is readily apparent--i.e., orthostatic hypotension or a vasovagal event. However, there are a large number of children with frequent recurrent unexplained syncope. Neither history, physical examination, nor standard testing reveals a cause. One hundred four consecutive patients were evaluated by orthostatic testing after standard methods found no cause for the recurrent syncope. Forty-seven (44%) of these 104 patients had syncope produced by orthostatic testing. Twenty-six of the 47 (55%) became syncopal within 5 minutes of testing initiation and 21 of the 47 (45%) after 5 to 11 minutes of testing. These patients had an average decrease of 81.5 mm Hg in blood pressure and a 25 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Of 12 control subjects, none lost consciousness with standing times as long as 14 minutes. Pacing was ineffective in preventing syncope, as two patients with a previously implanted normally functioning pacemaker had recurrent syncope clinically. Syncope was also induced by orthostatic testing, with the pacemaker showing a normal response with pacing as the patient became bradycardic. The syncopal event produced by orthostatic testing occurred with a downward blood pressure trend and a narrowing of the pulse pressure without a significant increase in heart rate. This was followed by a sudden drop in blood pressure and then by bradycardia. There is a group of children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope due to abnormal orthostatic control mechanisms. Orthostatic testing appears helpful in identifying these patients. 
Beriberi heart disease in a schizophrenic with an unusual diet. A 37-year-old male presented with peripheral edema of sudden onset. Other signs of heart failure were absent. Subsequent evaluation revealed that the patient was a schizophrenic whose diet consisted almost entirely of carbohydrates. A clinical diagnosis of beriberi heart disease was made and the patient improved dramatically within several days of thiamine supplementation. The presentation of beriberi heart disease in developed countries is discussed. Emphasis is placed on food faddists and psychiatric patients in whom clinical findings may be subtle or absent. 
Reversal of low dose angiotension hypertension by angiotensin receptor antagonists. During acute angiotension II (Ang II) infusion (200 ng/kg/min i.v.) into anesthetized rats, mean arterial pressure rose from 124 +/- 1 to 154 +/- 2 mm Hg. The peptidic Ang II antagonist saralasin lowered arterial pressure in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal decrease in pressure was similar to that observed after the Ang II infusion was discontinued. The nonpeptide Ang II antagonist, 4'-[( 2-butyl-4-chloro-5-(hydroxymethyl)-1H-imidazole-1-yl] methyl) [1,1'-biphenyl] -2-carboxylic acid (SC-48742), lowered acutely elevated arterial pressure to a level similar to that on discontinuation of the angiotensin infusion. Chronic (8 days) infusion of Ang II (20 ng/kg/min i.v.) increased mean arterial pressure from 116 +/- 3 to 164 +/- 7 mm Hg, which then decreased to 121 +/- 6 mm Hg on termination of the infusion. Saralasin (10 micrograms/kg/min, a maximally effective dose during acute angiotensin infusion) decreased mean arterial pressure from 168 +/- 7 to 141 +/- 3 mm Hg, a pressure significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than the pressure observed after the angiotensin infusion was discontinued. SC-48742 decreased mean arterial pressure from 167 +/- 7 to 127 +/- 3 mm Hg, a pressure not statistically different from the minimum pressure observed after the angiotensin infusion was terminated. The mechanism of blood pressure elevation during acute high dose or chronic low dose Ang II infusion is different, the latter having a significant neural component as measured by the response to trimethaphan. The peptidic antagonist saralasin was fully effective in lowering acute angiotensin hypertension but only partially effective during chronic hypertension. 
Radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility: results in 170 patients with chest pain. The role of radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility in patients with chest pain has been studied rarely. Consequently, we compared the results of radiologic and manometric examinations of the esophagus in 170 patients (106 women, 64 men; mean age, 53 years) with chest pain. Manometry, used as the standard, was normal in 114 (67%) patients, and showed the following abnormal diagnoses in the remaining 56 (33%): nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 27 (48%), nutcracker esophagus in 16 (29%), diffuse esophageal spasm in 11 (20%), and achalasia in two (4%). Radiologic specificity was 93% (106/114) and overall sensitivity only 36% (20/56). Sensitivity increased to 50% by excluding those with nutcracker esophagus, a purely manometric diagnosis. Of the 20 patients in whom nonspecific esophageal motility disorder and diffuse esophageal spasm were undetected on radiologic examination, minimal manometric criteria for diagnosis were available in 18. Our results show that radiologic recognition of normal esophageal peristalsis is excellent. However, the vast majority of patients with chest pain do not appear to have abnormal esophageal motility on radiologic evaluation. 
Junctional tachycardias: anatomic substrate and its significance in ablative procedures. The conduction system was studied by serial section in three patients with intractable supraventricular tachycardias originating from the atrioventricular (AV) junction who died suddenly. The three patients were a 6 month old girl (Case 1), a 5 month old boy (Case 2) and a 22 year old woman (Case 3). The latter had a pacemaker inserted after surgical ablation of the AV node. The heart was hypertrophied and enlarged in all. In Case 1, the AV node was partly within the central fibrous body and there was a left-sided AV bundle with acute necrosis in the summit of the ventricular septum, adjacent to the AV node and bundle. In Case 2, the coronary sinus was displaced cranially close to the central fibrous body, resulting in abnormality of the latter, with entrapment, distortion and division of the AV node and bundle into two distinct components within the central fibrous body. In Case 3, a left-sided AV node was connected to the atrial septum. The right AV node was completely interrupted by sutures and the penetrating and branching bundle and bundle branches were markedly fibrosed. In addition, the atrial septum and summit of the ventricular septum showed marked inflammatory reaction with fibrosis, which was more marked on the right ventricular side. Histologic examination of the conduction system in all three cases demonstrated congenital abnormalities of the AV junction that may be related to the tachycardia. These findings emphasize the need to carefully evaluate the atrial septum and AV junctional area, including the coronary sinus, before ablative procedures are undertaken. 
The Carney complex with ocular signs suggestive of cardiac myxoma. We treated a patient who had ophthalmic findings of the Carney complex that led to a search for and the discovery of asymptomatic cardiac myxoma. Substantial morbidity and mortality are associated with the complex because of the occurrence of cardiac myxoma. Facial and eyelid lentigines, conjunctival and caruncle pigmentation and eyelid pigmentation may precede signs or symptoms of cardiac myxoma. A study of the patient's primary relatives disclosed manifestations of the complex transmitted in a manner consistent with mendelian autosomal dominant inheritance. 
Tuberculosis cutis miliaris disseminata as a manifestation of miliary tuberculosis: literature review and report of a case of recurrent skin lesions. The development of severe adverse reactions to antituberculous drugs in a patient with miliary tuberculosis led to unorthodox, suboptimal antituberculous therapy. The patient's failure to respond to therapy was discovered when acid-fast bacilli were detected in new skin lesions. Such lesions have been described in the literature as tuberculosis cutis miliaris disseminata; 24 cases (in addition to that described herein) have been reported thus far. The patient eventually recovered completely after detection and drainage of a large retrofascial tuberculous abscess. This case illustrates the importance of careful examination of the skin in clinical medicine, as tuberculosis cutis miliaris disseminata is an easily overlooked sign of miliary tuberculosis. 
Importance of ulceration of carotid plaque in determining symptoms of cerebral ischemia. In order to investigate the relationship between carotid plaque morphology and symptoms of cerebral ischemia, a prospective clinicopathological study was performed. Ninety consecutive intact carotid plaques obtained from surgery and 43 carotid plaques from cadavers without symptoms of cerebral ischemia were evaluated. Ulceration and mural thrombus were the only morphologic findings statistically correlated to the presence of hemispheric symptoms (p less than 0.02). Intramural hemorrhage was more common in patients with hemispheric symptoms but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.31). Plaque causing high degree stenosis had a higher incidence of intramural hemorrhage (p = 0.04) and ulceration (p less than 0.02). Ulceration of plaque plays a major role in the onset of hemispheric symptoms. The results of our study support the hypothesis that in the majority of the cases, hemispheric symptoms are embolic in nature. 
Early experience with the smart laser in the treatment of atherosclerotic occlusions. A dual-laser system (helium-cadmium and pulsed dye) capable of continuous computer analysis of spectroscopic characteristics of tissue fluorescence, which can distinguish atherosclerotic plaque from components of normal arterial wall, was used to deliver laser energy to ablate plaque. During a 1-year period this system was used to facilitate balloon angioplasty of short (3 to 17 cm) total occlusions of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries only when standard angioplasty techniques were ineffective. During the year of the study, in one institution 415 patients were subjected to arteriography of the lower extremities for leg ischemia (397 for limb salvage indications). Standard angioplasty techniques were used in 94 of these patients; 218 patients were unsuitable for standard angioplasty, did not fulfill criteria for "smart" laser treatment, and underwent standard bypass operations. Only 11 patients (plus six others in the second institution) requiring treatment fulfilled the criteria for use of the "smart" laser. In 10 patients the occluding lesion was traversed by the laser wire (diameter 0.021 inch), and luminal patency was effectively restored by balloon angioplasty to greater than or equal to 70% of the most normal-appearing segment of that artery. Satisfactory luminal patency has persisted for 2 to 12 months (mean 6 months) in nine patients; the lesion in the tenth patient restenosed at 3 months. The laser procedure was unsuccessful in all three patients with occlusions greater than 10 cm and in four others. Although there were three microperforations with the laser wire, there were no clinically significant complications. 
The cubital tunnel and ulnar neuropathy. The anatomy of the cubital tunnel and its relationship to ulnar nerve compression is not well documented. In 27 cadaver elbows the proximal edge of the roof of the cubital tunnel was formed by a fibrous band that we call the cubital tunnel retinaculum (CTR). The band is about 4 mm wide, extending from the medial epicondyle to the olecranon, and perpendicular to the flexor carpi ulnaris aponeurosis. Variations in the CTR were classified into four types. In type 0 (n = 1) the CTR was absent. In type Ia (n = 17), the retinaculum was lax in extension and taut in full flexion. In type Ib (n = 6) it was tight in positions short of full flexion (90 degrees to 120 degrees). In type II (n = 3) it was replaced by a muscle, the anconeus epitrochlearis. The CTR appears to be a remnant of the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle and its function is to hold the ulnar nerve in position. Variations in the anatomy of the CTR may explain certain types of ulnar neuropathy. Its absence (type 0 CTR) permits ulnar nerve displacement. Type Ia is normal and does not cause ulnar neuropathy. Type Ib can cause dynamic nerve compression with elbow flexion. Type II may be associated with static compression due to the bulk of the anconeus epitrochlearis muscle. 
Prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In a group of 236 very low birth weight (VLBW) surviving infants, 60 had developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the nursery. When compared with the 176 infants without BPD, infants with BPD were smaller, more immature, with lower one- and five-minute Apgar scores. Infants with BPD had a greater incidence of cardio-pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) complications in the nursery. On follow-up, 25 (42%) of these infants were abnormal developmentally compared to 7% of infants without BPD (p less than .001). When comparisons were made within the group of infants with BPD, very few differences were found in maternal or infant risk factors between the normal and abnormal infants. The infants with BPD who had poor outcome more often had seizures and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The infants with BPD who had good outcome were more often small for gestational age (SGA) and resuscitated with intubation at birth. They had apnea in the nursery more frequently than did abnormal infants with BPD. We conclude that VLBW infants with BPD are at greater risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome than those without BPD. The risk for the infant with BPD relates to CNS complications rather than to chronic lung disease. 
Postoperative pulmonary edema in young, athletic adults. Pulmonary edema secondary to postextubation laryngospasm is a potentially life-threatening problem, demanding early diagnosis and prompt treatment. We believe that this problem has been grossly underestimated in its incidence, as only seven adults have been reported in the English literature, whereas seven adults have been observed at our institution in only a 24 month period. All were young, healthy, athletic adult males (average weight, 218 pounds) who underwent relatively minor, uncomplicated surgical procedures under general anesthesia. Five of these patients were collegiate and/or professional athletes and had meticulous medical records detailing their clinical course. Clinical laryngospasm was noted immediately following extubation and anesthesia by mask with subsequent pulmonary edema. The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical examination, arterial blood gas determinations or pulse oximetry, and chest roentgenogram. Four adults required reintubation. Six of the seven adults demonstrated very rapid resolution of the pulmonary edema with prompt diagnosis and institution of a therapeutic regimen including oxygen, diuretics, reintubation, and/or positive pressure ventilation. In one patient, the problem was not immediately recognized, and progressed to florid pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation 14 hours later in the emergency room, and 3 days of mechanical ventilation. The etiology of pulmonary edema following upper airway obstruction represents an interplay between several factors: cardiogenic and neurogenic mechanisms, as well as hypoxia contribute. In this group, excessive negative intrathoracic pressure generated by forced inspiration against a closed glottis is the most likely, consistent, and logical explanation. This study suggests that young, healthy, athletic males may be at increased risk for this complication. 
Mammographic densities and risk of breast cancer. To determine the relation of mammographic densities to subsequent breast cancer risk, a case-control study was undertaken using prediagnostic mammograms of screening program participants. Mammograms of cases (n = 266) and controls (n = 301) were blindly assessed for mammographic densities, which were measured by planimetry. The odds of breast cancer increased steadily with increasing breast density (test for trend, P less than 0.0001). Breast cancer odds was 1.7 for densities between 5% and 24.9%, 2.5 for 25% through 44.9%, 3.8 for 45% through 64%, and 4.3 for densities of 65% and greater (referent = less than 5% densities). Odds ratios also increased with increasing densities among women with the P2 and DY mammographic patterns. These findings suggest that the percentage of mammographic densities in the breast can predict breast cancer risk more accurately than a qualitative assessment of mammographic patterns. 
Major vascular complications of orthognathic surgery: false aneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas following orthognathic surgery. False aneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas are rare complications of orthognathic surgery. The vessel most commonly involved with false aneurysms following mandibular surgery is the internal maxillary artery, and this vessel, especially the sphenopalatine branch, may also be involved following maxillary surgery. An unusual factor in the presentation of false aneurysms following Le Fort I osteotomies is an initial episode of epistaxis occurring greater than 2 weeks postoperatively. Arteriovenous fistulas following orthognathic surgery are more apt to involve large vessels, especially the internal carotid artery. Embolization procedures are the treatment of choice for false aneurysms and arteriovenous fistulas in the maxillofacial region following orthognathic surgery. 
Pharmacokinetics of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin during elective aortobifemoral bypass grafting. Perioperative monitoring has demonstrated that administration of heparin on an empirical basis is associated with a wide variation in patient response and elimination rate. This problem may be overcome by intervention on the basis of perioperative monitoring or by using forms of heparin with different pharmacokinetic properties. When compared with unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin has a higher bioavailability after subcutaneous administration, a linear clearance mechanism with a prolonged half-life, and is at least as effective in preventing postoperative vein thrombosis. Theoretically these characteristics of low-molecular-weight heparin could lead to more predictable levels of heparin activity. In this study we compared the pharmacokinetics of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin after an intravenous injection in patients undergoing aortic graft surgery. Heparin activity was measured before heparin administration and at 5, 20, 35, 50, 65, 80, 95, and 110 minutes after administration. The anti-Xa activity in the low-molecular-weight heparin group showed less variation and was more sustained when compared to the unfractionated heparin group. Fibrin degradation products were moderately correlated with the anti-factor Xa levels of the low-molecular-weight heparin group, but no correlation was found in the unfractionated heparin group. The anti-factor Xa activity of low-molecular-weight heparin was, in contrast to that of unfractionated heparin, not completely reversible by protamine administration. The blood loss was comparable in both groups. In contrast to what was expected, the pharmacokinetic profiles of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin showed a similarity after intravenous injection in patients undergoing aortobifemoral bypass grafting. Factors that could have influenced the pharmacokinetic behavior of heparin are discussed. 
Physiologic and anatomic assessment of patients with rectocele. Clinical, physiologic, and anatomic assessments were carried out in 22 female patients with symptomatic rectocele (Group A), 15 patients with asymptomatic rectocele (Group B), and 14 subjects having no rectocele (Group C). Resting and pressure, rectal pressure, rectal compliance, anorectal inhibitory reflex, and rectal sensation did not differ among the groups. Proctography revealed that the lengths of the rectocele during attempted defecation in groups A (1.6 [1.0-3.5] cm) (median and range) and B (1.6 [1.0-3.0] cm) were significantly greater than that in Group C (0.4 [0.1-0.9] cm) (P less than 0.001 in both groups). Median pelvic floor descent at rest in Groups A (4.3 [1.6-7.5] cm) (median and range) and B (4.3 [1.3-6.9] cm) were significantly greater than that in Group C (2.5 [1.2-5.0] cm) (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.02, respectively). These results indicate that rectocele is not associated with any physiologic change apart from a significant increase of pelvic floor descent. 
Final report on the second British Institute of Radiology fractionation study: short versus long overall treatment times for radiotherapy of carcinoma of the laryngo-pharynx. The second British Institute of Radiology trial of dose fractionation in radiotherapy compared two groups of prospectively randomized patients with squamous carcinoma of the laryngo-pharynx; one group was treated in a short (less than or equal to 4 weeks) and the other in a long (greater than 4 weeks) overall time. Treatment in any one centre could be given, with no planned gap in the course of treatment, either as a conventional, daily (5 fractions per week regime) or as 3 fractions per week. A total of 611 patients were allocated to treatment, of whom nine have had to be excluded from the analysis for a lack of information. Patients were admitted to the trial from January 1976 to December 1985 and were followed up for a maximum of 10 years and a minimum of 3 years. A reduction in total dose was made for use in the short compared with the long treatment regime. This reduction in total dose varied between 18% and 22% depending on whether 5 fractions or 3 fractions per week regimes were used. Overall, no statistically significant differences have been found between the two arms of the trial. The patients treated with 5 fractions per week in a short overall treatment time showed fewer late normal tissue effects. An analysis based on stratification by age, stage and anatomical site gave a relative risk (short/long overall treatment time) for deaths of 1.23 with a 95% confidence interval from 0.96 to 1.59. Analyses stratified for stage and site gave relative risks with 95% confidence intervals of 1 x 10 (0.84-1.44) for local recurrences/tumour persistence, and 1.01 (0.70-1.45) for laryngectomies. 
Prevalence and natural history of otitis media with perforation in Maori school children. New Zealand Maoris are one of five ethnic groups in developed countries known to have a high rate of ear disease, including perforation of the eardrum (CSOM). It is a strongly held belief by otolaryngologists whose practice dates back to the 1960's that the prevalence of CSOM in Maori children is gradually falling. Despite the obvious practical implications this change has not yet been documented. The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence of CSOM in two surveys conducted in 1978 and 1987 of children living in a North Island Maori community. A second aim was to examine the natural history of CSOM in these children. The raw data from the 1978 study were reviewed. Of 134 children aged 4-13, 12 had CSOM. In 1987 the same age group yielded 12 children out of 250 with CSOM. The prevalence of CSOM fell from 9 per cent to 4 per cent. The incidence of new perforations in 1987 was 1.3 per cent per child per year. It is concluded there has been a fall in the rate of CSOM, although otitis media remains a significant problem for these children. The probability of a perforation healing was influenced by whether or not the perforation had been observed before: at least 35 per cent of perforations seen for the first time healed, but none of the perforations seen on two occasions healed spontaneously. It was concluded that perforation of the eardrum can be managed conservatively at first. 
Persistent bile leak after liver transplantation: biloma drainage and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic sphincterotomy. Persistent bile leaks after liver transplantation were successfully treated in three patients with percutaneous or surgical drainage of bilomas and endoscopic retrograde ampullary sphincterotomy. In all three patients, biliary anastomoses were achieved by means of choledochocholedochostomies, with a T-tube stent in the anastomosis. The bile leaks led to subhepatic bilomas that had persistently high catheter outputs (greater than 200 mL per 24 hours) for longer than 1 month. Biloma drainage decreased shortly after sphincterotomy. 
Combined pterional-anterolateral approaches to cranial base tumors. Advanced tumors of the paranasal sinuses, parotid gland, orbit, parapharynx, and cranial cavity may invade the infratemporal fossa by direct extension or through natural anatomic pathways. The inability to control disease involving this region is reflected by the unacceptably high recurrence rates for both intracranial and extracranial neoplasms. Between 1983 and 1986, a pterional (or subtemporal) approach was combined with such conventional anterolateral procedures as a mandibulopharyngectomy, maxillectomy, orbitectomy, and parotidectomy in 13 patients with advanced skull base lesions. The tumor origin was extracranial in ten cases and intracranial in three patients. Seven of the neoplasms were malignant and six were histologically benign. Complete tumor removal was achieved in all patients. Repair of the ablative defect was achieved with a temporalis myogenous flap in ten patients, and primary closure or distant myocutaneous flaps in the remaining three patients. Postoperative complications included three lateral nasocutaneous fistulae secondary to temporalis myogenous flap necrosis and isolated cases of stroke, cerebral edema, pneumocephalus, and cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. Twelve patients are alive without evidence of disease at a mean interval of 25 months. The remaining patient died from lung metastases 11 months after surgery. 
Clinical role of respiratory virus infection in acute otitis media. The clinical characteristics of acute otitis media in relation to coexisting respiratory virus infection were studied in a 1-year prospective study of 363 children with acute otitis media. Respiratory viruses were detected using virus isolation and virus antigen detection in nasopharyngeal specimens of 42% of the patients at the time of diagnosis. Rhinovirus (24%) and respiratory syncytial virus (13%) were the two most common viruses detected. Adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43 were found less frequently. The mean duration of preceding symptoms was 5.9 days before the diagnosis of acute otitis media. Ninety-four percent of the children had symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. Fever was reported in 55% and earache in 47% of cases. Patients with respiratory syncytial virus infection had fever, cough, and vomiting significantly more often than patients with rhinovirus infection or virus-negative patients. No significant differences were found in the appearance of the tympanic membrane and outcome of illness between virus-negative and virus-positive patients with acute otitis. Most patients respond well to antimicrobial therapy despite the coexisting viral infection. If the symptoms of infection persist, they can be due to the underlying viral infection, and viral diagnostics preferably with rapid methods may be clinically useful in these patients. 
Rationale for the use of 5-HT1-like agonists in the treatment of migraine. Migraine headache is thought to be associated with a dilatation of cranial blood vessels, particularly those in the dura mater, and an accompanying localized sterile inflammatory response. Sumatriptan is a highly selective 5-HT1-like receptor agonist which selectively constricts cranial blood vessels (including those in the dura mater). It also inhibits neurogenically-mediated plasma protein extravasation in the dura mater. Haemodynamic studies in anaesthetized animals have shown that sumatriptan selectively constricts the carotid arterial circulation and this effect appears to be restricted to an effect on carotid arteriovenous anastomoses. Sumatriptan has a much more selective pharmacological profile than ergot preparations which are also used in the acute treatment of migraine. The development of sumatriptan has been based on a vascular theory of migraine and its high degree of efficacy in the treatment of migraine strengthens the argument that dilatation of cranial blood vessels is the cause of vascular headache. 
Abdominal pain in HIV infection. The causes of abdominal pain in patients with AIDS are different from those of the general population, and there are no guidelines as to which investigations are optimal. We reviewed our experience of 63 patients who presented with abdominal pain as the main reason for admission to the AIDS unit at St Stephen's and Westminster Hospital between January 1988 and January 1990. All patients were assessed within the same structured diagnostic programme. Thirty-five had upper abdominal pain, predominantly in the right upper quadrant in 27; seven had lower abdominal pain, which was concentrated in the right iliac fossa in three; 21 had diffuse abdominal pain. The causes of pain were determined satisfactorily in the majority of patients using routine gastroenterological investigations. The predominant site of pain had considerable predictive value in the diagnosis. The commonest cause of right upper quadrant pain was sclerosing cholangitis (17 of 27); endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography was necessary for a confident diagnosis. Diarrhoea was frequently associated (15 of 21) with diffuse abdominal pain; the commonest cause (six of 21) was cytomegalovirus colitis. Neoplasia was the cause of abdominal pain in eight patients. The other causes of abdominal pain and the utility of various investigations are discussed. An investigatory route which may provide maximum information has been suggested. 
Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation in subjects with peristalsis: prevalence and clinical outcome. Incomplete lower esophageal sphincter relaxation is recognized in achalasia and has been reported in subjects with esophageal spasm. We reviewed 500 consecutive manometric studies from a 3-yr period to determine the prevalence of this manometric finding, its association with other motility abnormalities, and the clinical outcome of subjects without associated aperistalsis (i.e., without achalasia). We identified 60 subjects with incomplete lower sphincter relaxation, 17 of whom had at least some normal peristalsis (3.4% of the total). Mean lower sphincter residual pressure for these 17 subjects (4.5 +/- 2.8 mm Hg) was intermediate between those with achalasia (11.7 +/- 6.8 mm Hg) and those with normal relaxation (0.1 +/- 0.2 mm Hg). Both peristaltic and contraction abnormalities in the esophageal body were prevalent in the 17 subjects compared with those who had normal relaxation. Outcome with conservative medical therapy after a mean follow-up of 3.3 yr was not significantly related to presence of peristaltic or contraction abnormalities at presentation, and 71% of subjects with or without these concomitant findings had improvement or complete resolution of symptoms. Only one subject worsened and was treated with pneumatic dilation. We conclude that incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter without aperistalsis is uncommon, symptom regression occurs with conservative therapy, and pneumatic dilation appears rarely required over a modest follow-up period. 
Relation of stenosis resolution pressure to long-term clinical outcome after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Variables associated with a poor long-term prognosis after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) include a short duration of symptoms before PTCA, unstable angina and the presence of thrombus at the PTCA site. These imply a component of transient or dynamic obstruction as opposed to a pure fixed obstruction. It is postulated that resolution pressure (i.e., the pressure at which complete balloon inflation occurs) may also correlate with prognosis after successful PTCA. In 173 consecutive patients undergoing successful, elective, single-lesion PTCA, 48 (28%) were found to have narrowings that resolved at less than or equal to 2 atm (group 1) and 125 (72%) were found to have narrowings resolved at greater than 2 atm (group 2). There were no significant differences in baseline, anatomic or procedural variables between the 2 groups, except that angiographic coronary dissection occurred in 17% of group 1 patients versus 40% of group 2 patients (p less than 0.007). During a mean follow-up of 12.0 +/- 6.1 months, the incidence of cardiac events (repeat PTCA, coronary artery bypass grafting or myocardial infarction) was 29% in group 1 versus 15% in group 2 (p less than 0.05). The overall incidence of angina was similar between the groups (25 vs 28%), but Canadian Cardiovascular Association class 4 angina occurred significantly more frequently in group 1 than group 2 (21 vs 8%) (p less than 0.04). These data suggest that a low resolution pressure is associated with a higher incidence of unstable angina and recurrent cardiac events during follow-up than higher resolution pressures. 
What if Americans ate less fat? A quantitative estimate of the effect on mortality. Americans consume an average of 37% of their energy intake as fat. Many authorities recommend restricting fat intake to 30% of energy intake to reduce the rates of coronary heart disease and perhaps of cancers of the breast, colon, and prostate. Based on the assumptions that underlie those recommendations, we estimated the effect of this dietary change on mortality. If all Americans restricted their intake of dietary fat by reducing consumption of saturated fat and accompanying dietary cholesterol, the corresponding reductions in serum cholesterol levels could reduce coronary heart disease mortality rates by 5% to 20%, depending on age. If the relationship between dietary fat and cancer is as strong as has been observed in some studies, the proportional effects on mortality from fat-related cancers could be even greater, although the absolute effects--given the lower mortality rates--would be smaller. Overall, if the assumptions are correct, about 42,000 of the 2.3 million deaths that would have occurred in adults each year in the United States could be deferred. This 2% benefit, equivalent to an increase in average life expectancy of 3 to 4 months, would accrue chiefly to people over the age of 65 years. If recent concerns about the possibly harmful effects of cholesterol lowering on mortality from noncardiovascular causes--which mainly affect younger persons--are valid, these relatively modest benefits would be overestimates of the actual effect. 
Near normalization of adolescent height with growth hormone therapy in very short children without growth hormone deficiency. Ten prepubertal children with stature at or below the 1st percentile for height and without growth hormone deficiency received 0.3 U recombinant growth hormone per kilogram daily for 2 years before puberty. Their growth velocity increased from 4 +/- 0.3 cm/yr before treatment to 10.7 +/- 0.6 and 8.8 +/- 0.6 cm, respectively, during the first and second years of treatment, and then remained at 5.7 +/- 0.7 cm the year after the end of growth hormone administration. This resulted in a near normalization of adolescent height. Bone maturation paralleled chronologic age, and therefore the expected final height of the children increased by approximately 10 cm. Administration of growth hormone induced a reversible hyperinsulinemia, with moderate and transient changes in glucose metabolism. A prospective, randomized study, including an untreated cohort, will be needed to confirm the effects on final height and to determine the magnitude of the response in familial short stature. 
Gastric duplication cyst. Endoscopic presentation as an ulcerated antral mass. A case of a 53-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain and weight loss is described. Endoscopy showed a smooth antral mass with what appeared to be a central overlying ulcer. Computerized tomography and upper gastrointestinal series confirmed the presence of a gastric mass. Laparotomy and local resection showed a gastric duplication comprised of two cysts, one with communication to the stomach lumen. Gastric duplication is a rare entity, especially in the adult. Though generally benign, local ulceration or fistula formation can cause symptoms and may suggest a more malignant process that warrants investigation. 
Distinction between metabolic and myogenic mechanisms of coronary hyperemic response to brief diastolic occlusion. We monitored an index of coronary vascular resistance (mean aortic pressure/mean coronary flow) in 19 heart-blocked conscious dogs paced at 60 beats/min and instrumented with an aortic pressure catheter, left circumflex artery electromagnetic flow probe, and a coronary occluder. Cessation of pacing for a single beat resulted in a long diastole control (LDC) intervention beat of 2-second duration characterized by a progressive rise in diastolic coronary vascular resistance index. A 400-msec coronary artery occlusion early in a long diastole (LD4) dramatically inhibited the rate of rise in resistance index during the first 600 msec (phase 1) after occlusion. Partial recovery of the resistance index rise rate was evident during the remaining 400 msec (phase 2) of the long diastole. In nine dogs, LDC and LD4 intervention beats were instituted during two conditions of myocardial metabolic activity in which the myogenic stimuli associated with coronary occlusion would be similar: 1) paired pacing and 2) normal pacing plus intravenous adenosine and phenylephrine infusions (AP) to maintain mean aortic pressure and coronary flow at paired pacing levels. During paired pacing, the LD4-LDC differences in phase 1 and 2 resistance index rise rates (-69 +/- 18 and -48 +/- 31 mmHg/ml/sec2, respectively) were greater than during normal pacing plus AP (-32 +/- 14 and -1 +/- 32 mm Hg/ml/sec2, phase 1 and 2, respectively) (p less than 0.05). These differences are consistent with operation of a metabolic mechanism in response to occlusion. 
Sympathetic secretory response to hypercapnic acidosis in swine. We studied the effect of graded acute hypercapnic acidosis (HA) on sympathetic neural activation in 15 juvenile farm swine in vivo. In seven animals with acute HA, plasma norepinephrine (NE) concentration increased progressively from 189 +/- 34 to 483 +/- 80 pg/ml (P less than 0.04) as arterial CO2 partial pressure (PaCO2) increased in steps from 40 to 80 Torr (pH 7.17 +/- 0.01). Plasma epinephrine (EPI) concentration increased from 30 +/- 15 to 125 +/- 66 pg/ml (P = NS) over the same change in PaCO2. At PaCO2 of 110 Torr, plasma NE increased 3.4-fold above maximal basal concentrations; plasma EPI was 1.8-fold greater than basal under the same conditions. With HA, systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreased from 1,748 +/- 110 to 1,392 +/- 145 dyn.s.cm-5 (P less than 0.0002), cardiac output (CO) increased from 3.4 +/- 0.3 to 4.3 +/- 0.3 l/min (P less than 0.01), and heart rate (HR) increased from 117 +/- 11 to 154 +/- 17 beats/min (P less than 0.03). To demonstrate that catecholamine secretion was related directly to acidosis caused by an increase in PaCO2, HCO3- was infused in eight other swine to buffer extracellular acute HA (pH 7.37 +/- 0.01 at PaCO2 of 80 Torr). Buffering attenuated the increase in plasma NE, which remained within the normal range at PaCO2 of 80 Torr. The decrease in SVR and increases in CO and HR also were also attenuated by HCO3- buffering of HA. We demonstrate the effects of graded acute HA on endogenous secretion of catecholamine and on the associated hemodynamic responses in swine. 
Metabolism of 25-OH-vitamin D3 by peritoneal macrophages from CAPD patients. The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol (1,25(OH)2D3), is produced mainly by the kidney, but there is evidence for extrarenal production in certain circumstances. We studied whether peritoneal macrophages (PM) from CAPD patients were capable of metabolizing 25-OH-D3 to 1,25(OH)2D3. We found that PM were able to metabolize 25-OH-D3 in vitro; the main product following 16 hours of incubation was 19-nor, 10-oxo, 25-OH-D3 with smaller amounts of 1,25(OH)2D3. However, after shorter incubations of three and five hours a larger portion of 1,25(OH)2D3 was produced. The metabolism of 25-OH-D3 was greatly enhanced in PM harvested during episodes of peritonitis. This property was specific for PM of CAPD patients, and was not found in PM from normal subjects. However, incubation of control PM with peritoneal effluent from CAPD patients resulted in induction of the ability of these cells to metabolize 25-OH-D3. This induction was enhanced by preincubation with peritoneal effluent from CAPD patients suffering from peritonitis. Prostaglandin E2 was found to be involved in this synthesis: addition of PGE2 to normal PM induced metabolism of 25-OH-D3, and incubation of PM from CAPD patients with indomethacin decreased the metabolism of 25-OH-D3. The vitamin D metabolites produced by PM from CAPD patients could have a role in immunological resistance to peritoneal infections. 
Recombinant alpha interferon in metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A cooperative phase II study. A total of 61 evaluable patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma have been treated with 3 x 10(6) IU per square meter of body surface with recombinant alpha 2b interferon three times a week within a Cooperative Phase II Study. Toxic death for terminal renal failure occurred in 1 patient (1.63%), and toxicities greater than WHO grade 2 were present in 10 cases (16%). The overall response rate after six months of treatment was 13.1% (partial response 4, minor response 4). Two complete responses were obtained at nine and fifteen months (3.3%). Long-lasting stabilization of disease was 13.1 percent. 
Screening mammography. Screening mammography can reduce mortality from breast cancer and is the only means of detecting nonpalpable cancers that are often more curable. Based on this, guidelines have evolved but compliance with them has been slow. Reservations are based on yield-cost-benefit-harm considerations, but uniformed and/or disadvantaged women and reluctance if not resistance to screening mammography by primary care physicians are major problems. The challenges are to overcome these obstacles and to obtain sufficient competent personnel and facilities to make reproducibly optimum screening mammography, which is accurately interpreted, widely available to all eligible women at the lowest possible cost. 
Colposcopic evaluation of human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive women. To determine the effect of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection on cervical histology, 32 known HIV-seropositive women underwent cervical colposcopic evaluation. All had cervical cytology, colposcopically directed biopsy, and T-cell studies performed. Thirteen of 32 patients (41%) had cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Another 14 of 32 patients (44%) had histologic evidence of cervicitis. Abnormal cytology, noted in only three women, suggested CIN in one and inflammatory atypia in two. All (five of five) patients with a clinical diagnosis of AIDS had CIN, compared with 30% (eight of 27) of non-AIDS HIV-positive patients (P less than .05). Patients diagnosed with CIN had significantly lower CD4 cell counts (221/mm3 versus 408/mm3; P less than .06) and CD4:CD8 ratios (0.33 versus 0.62; P less than .02) than those without CIN. Patients with cervicitis had greater T-cell immunosuppression than did those with normal histology. In addition, patients with AIDS were more likely to have higher-grade lesions than were non-AIDS HIV-seropositive patients. Seven of 12 CIN specimens available for analysis by polymerase chain reaction using consensus sequence primers detected human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA, including three patients with three or more HPV types. Our data suggest that abnormal cervical pathology is common among HIV-positive women and that cytologic screening is not predictive of CIN in this population. In addition, the presence and severity of cervical dysplasia correlates with quantitative T-cell function. We strongly recommend that cervical colposcopy be part of the routine management of HIV-seropositive women. 
Abrupt outpatient withdrawal of medication in analgesic-abusing migraineurs. 46 migraineurs with secondary chronic daily headache were treated for medication abuse as outpatients by abrupt withdrawal of the offending drugs. The patients were supported with adequate explanation of the disorder, regular follow-up, amitriptyline (10 mg at night), and naproxen (500 mg) for relief of headache symptoms. By 6 months of follow-up 37 patients had relief from chronic headaches, and analgesic intake had become intermittent and appropriate to the original occasional migraine episodes. 6 had substantially reduced analgesic intake, but headache severity was unchanged; 2 had not managed to reduce intake and headache was unchanged; and 1 patient withdrew after the first visit. 
Factors affecting compliance with screening sigmoidoscopy BACKGROUND. A retrospective, qualitative study in a university setting was undertaken to better understand factors influencing patient compliance with screening sigmoidoscopy. METHODS. Individuals who completed screening sigmoidoscopy were interviewed to learn about the physician-patient relationship, general knowledge of cancer, family experience with cancer, exposure to the media, and specific reasons why sigmoidoscopy was completed. RESULTS. Respondents reported that their physician's recommendation had a strong positive influence on their decision to have sigmoidoscopic screening, as did their family and personal experiences with cancer. In all cases, the patients stated that they would not have had a sigmoidoscopy without the recommendation of their physician. Respondents were little influenced by exposure to the media or by famous personalities. CONCLUSIONS. The importance of the physician's recommendation for the patient to have sigmoidoscopy and demonstration of concern with early cancer detection may represent the primary motivating factors in completion of screening sigmoidoscopy. 
An improved method for the quantification of left-to-right cardiac shunts. We have investigated a technique for quantifying QP/QS in left-to-right cardiac shunts. In this method, the gamma variate, which is fitted to the first-pass portion of the lung curve, is used to generate a curve, which simulates the response of a normal lung curve with systemic recirculation. The difference between this curve and the observed lung curve is then used to calculate QP/QS. This method was evaluated on a set of simulated lung time-activity curves with precisely known QP/QS values on a group of 11 patients with no clinical suspicion of cardiac shunt and on a group of 30 patients referred for cardiac shunt studies. The QP/QS in each of these studies was determined by three individuals using both the Maltz-Treves method and the new method. This method yielded QP/QS values that were more accurate on the simulated lung data and had less interobserver variation on all the studies than those obtained from the Maltz-Treves method. 
Diffuse Lewy body disease presenting with a supranuclear gaze palsy. A patient with diffuse Lewy body disease presented with supranuclear vertical and horizontal ophthalmoplegia, dementia, axial rigidity and falls, bradykinesia and pyramidal signs. This broadens the clinical presentation of this pathological diagnosis and re-emphasises the heterogeneity of patients diagnosed clinically as progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome). 
Computed tomography for patient management in coronary artery disease. Computed tomography (CT) represents the optimum theoretical approach to x-ray imaging. This conclusion results from an awareness of CT's capacity to solve the fundamental limitation of all forms of x-ray imaging--the superimposition of anatomic structures. Because CT is potentially a fully three-dimensional method, this problem is addressed in a manner not subject to the risks, complications, and technical limitations of selective angiography, subtraction angiography, tomography, and other techniques. Ultrafast CT provides a broad spectrum of useful quantitative cardiac data during one minimally invasive procedure. Therefore, the optimism for cine CT imaging of the heart is well founded. Apart from the demonstration of anatomic structures in any reconstructed plane and in movie format, without the need for any form of electrocardiographic gating, this new generation of millisecond CT scanners offers a unique potential for measuring myocardial mechanics and perfusion. Myocardial integrity can be evaluated by measuring myocardial wall thickening, which is a sensitive indicator of blood flow. It can also be assessed by time-density changes derived from analyzing the passage of contrast medium through thin slices of myocardium. Feasibility studies have demonstrated that this should be possible in the clinical setting by use of fast CT scanning. The radiation exposure to the patient with cine CT is low and comparable to, or less than, that of conventional CT and 10-15% of that received during angiocardiography; therefore, it is not a practical limitation. Further clinical and research studies are needed to determine the future role of this exciting new modality in the diagnosis and management of patients with heart disease. 
Arboviral infections in the United States. Arboviruses are important considerations in the differential diagnosis of encephalitis and other acute infections. Alterations in the environment and in human behaviors contribute to changing patterns of arboviral transmission. These trends, the periodic epidemic resurgence of arboviral diseases such as St. Louis encephalitis, and the discovery of new arboviruses present a continued challenge to infectious disease clinicians. 
Changes in protein, RNA and DNA and rates of protein synthesis in muscle-containing tissues of the mature rat in response to ethanol feeding: a comparative study of heart, small intestine and gastrocnemius muscle. 1. The relative sensitivity of heart, small intestine and skeletal muscle to chronic ethanol feeding was investigated in mature Wistar rats fed ethanol as 36% of total energy intake; controls were fed the same diet in which ethanol was substituted by isoenergetic glucose. 2. Chronic ethanol feeding had no apparent effect on the protein, RNA and DNA contents of heart homogenates (atria and ventricles). The ratios of RNA/protein (synthetic capacity), RNA/DNA (synthetic material per nucleus) and protein/DNA (DNA-unit or apparent cell size) were also unaltered in the hearts of alcohol-fed rats. Fractional rates of cardiac protein synthesis (ks), and synthesis relative to RNA (kRNA) and DNA (kDNA) and absolute rates of protein synthesis (Vs) were unaffected by ethanol feeding. The total content of cardiac soluble proteins was unaltered by chronic ethanol feeding, but there were small and statistically significant decreases in the contents of the myofibrillar and stromal protein fractions. There were no differences in ks in any of the cardiac subcellular protein fractions. 3. In the small intestine, ethanol feeding had no statistically significant effect on either protein or RNA contents, but there was an apparent increase in RNA when expressed relative to either protein or DNA, though the DNA-unit was unaltered. There were also substantial decreases in ks, kRNA, kDNA and Vs of approximately 15-35%. 4. In the gastrocnemius, RNA contents were significantly reduced by ethanol feeding but protein and DNA contents were unaffected. Indices of the synthetic capacity and synthetic material per nucleus were also reduced, but the DNA-unit was unaltered. These observations were accompanied by approx. 15-30% reductions in ks, kRNA, kDNA and Vs in response to ethanol feeding. 5. It is concluded that various aspects of protein metabolism in the heart, small intestine and skeletal muscle are adversely affected by chronic ethanol toxicity. The characteristics and magnitude of the responses in each tissue differ. Effects in the heart may be subtle, though haemodynamic indices may ensue. The ethanol-induced alterations in the small intestine and skeletal muscle may be responsible for gastrointestinal disturbances in motility and skeletal muscle weakness, respectively. 
Collagenous colitis: pathophysiologic considerations. Collagenous colitis, a cause of watery diarrhea characterized by a distinctive band of collagen under the surface epithelium of the colon, has been recognized with increasing frequency in recent years. The pathophysiology of collagenous colitis remains obscure. The thickening of the subepithelial collagen layer may be a response to chronic inflammation or a local abnormality of collagen synthesis. The precise mechanism of the diarrhea in collagenous colitis is also unclear, and it has not been possible to link the diarrhea directly to the excess collagen deposition. The relationship between collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, another type of microscopic colitis, remains to be defined; elucidating the relationship between the two disorders may provide clues to the pathophysiology of both. 
Possible linkage of the estrogen receptor gene to breast cancer in a family with late-onset disease. The estrogen-receptor locus is a candidate gene for inherited susceptibility to human breast cancer, particularly among families with later onset, primarily estrogen-receptor-positive tumors. For one extended family with eight patients with late-onset disease, one estrogen-receptor haplotype was consistently coinherited with breast cancer, yielding a +1.85 lod score for linkage at zero recombination. Simulation of this pedigree assuming independent inheritance of breast cancer and estrogen-receptor genotypes led to a lod score greater than or equal to 1.85 only once in 2,000 replicates. We suggest testing linkage of this gene to breast cancer in other families with late-onset disease. 
Clinical pharmacology of intravenous enoximone: pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in patients with heart failure. Twenty-one patients with heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] class II to IV) received a 24-hour infusion of enoximone followed by a 12-hour washout period. Patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Groups I to III received an 0.5 mg/kg bolus, followed by a maintenance infusion of 2.5, 5.0, or 10.0 micrograms/kg/min. Group IV patients received a maintenance infusion of 5.0 micrograms/kg/min without a loading dose. Serial assessment of hemodynamics, plasma levels of enoximone and enoximone sulfoxide, and ventricular ectopy were performed. Enoximone produced a clinically significant increase in cardiac index, and a decrease in mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure and systemic vascular resistance in all groups. Enoximone mildly increased heart rate, and had a minimal effect on mean arterial pressure. There was no statistically significant change in ventricular ectopy during the infusion. Significant hemodynamic improvement was noted at even the lowest infusion rate, and did not increase in linear fashion at higher infusion rates. In patients who did not receive an initial loading bolus of 0.5 mg/kg, the increase in cardiac index was delayed by approximately 1 hour. Plasma concentrations of both enoximone and its major metabolite continued to rise throughout the 24-hour infusion in group III (10.0 micrograms/kg/min), rather than reaching steady state as predicted by the terminal exponential half-lives of these compounds. This is suggestive of nonlinear pharmacokinetics and indicates a potential for excessive accumulation of enoximone and its metabolite during prolonged infusion. These findings may have important implications in guiding the intravenous administration of enoximone. 
Very severe self-poisoning lithium carbonate intoxication causing a myocardial infarction. A case of severe lithium carbonate self-poisoning is described, presenting with a very high serum lithium level (14.6 mmol/L) on admission. Lengthy and repeated hemodialyses were required to lower lithemia to nontoxic ranges. As is usually reported, our patient had prolonged neurologic manifestations (coma, hyperreflexia, fluctuating focal signs) and developed hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and diarrhea. Other less common features were the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction without coronary artery lesions and thrombocytopenia. The possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed. Hemodialysis and supportive intensive care treatment are commented upon. The final outcome was favorable, and the patient recovered completely. 
Quantification of ST-segment changes during coronary angioplasty in patients with left bundle branch block. Electrocardiographic manifestations of ischemia are difficult to interpret in the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB). Recently developed techniques allow continuous computerized digital analysis of ST segments that can be zeroed to the patient's own baseline electrocardiogram even if that baseline is abnormal conduction. With use of this technology, ST-segment changes during balloon coronary occlusion were compared in 10 patients with LBBB versus an age-, sex-, and coronary anatomy-matched population of 20 control subjects with normal baseline conduction. ST-segment deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm from baseline was present in 80% of patients with LBBB and in 75% of control patients (difference not significant). There was no significant difference between patients with LBBB versus control patients in maximal ST-segment deviation (2.6 +/- 1.7 vs 2.0 +/- 1.0 mm) or in ST-segment deviation measured after 60 seconds of occlusion (2.4 +/- 1.3 vs 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm). ST-segment deviation reached 1 mm more quickly in patients with LBBB (33 +/- 11 seconds) than in control subjects (60 +/- 36 seconds) (p = 0.003). It is concluded that ST-segment analysis is feasible in patients with LBBB using digital self-referenced ST analysis and may provide important clinical information regarding the presence of myocardial ischemia. 
Effects of early captopril administration on infarct expansion, left ventricular remodeling and exercise capacity after acute myocardial infarction. In a double-blind study, 99 patients (82 men, age range 40 to 75 years) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were randomly assigned to receive captopril or placebo. Treatment began within 24 hours of admission. Serial echocardiographic measurements of endocardial segment lengths and left ventricular (LV) volumes, and ejection fractions were obtained. The 2 groups were matched at baseline except for an excess of previous AMI in the placebo group (13 of 50 vs 2 of 49 patients, p = 0.002). The increase in anterior segment length, from baseline to 2 months, was significantly less in the captopril than in the placebo group (2.8 +/- 1.6 vs 10.4 +/- 2.4mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] -13.5 to -1.7, p = 0.01). The increase in posterior segment length was also less in the captopril group, but the difference was not significant (3.2 +/- 1.2 vs 7.0 +/- 1.8mm, 95% CI -8.0 to 0.5, p = 0.08). Fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated increases in segment length greater than 2 standard deviations of the measurement error (14 of 70 [20%] vs 29 of 72 [40%] patients, p = 0.009). In patients with anterior AMI, the infarct-containing anterior segment length increased by 4.5 +/- 2.3 mm in the captopril versus 12.4 +/- 3.1 mm in the placebo group (95% CI -15.7 to -0.2, p = 0.046), and fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated infarct expansion (6 of 20 [30%] vs 13 of 21 [62%] patients, p = 0.04). 
Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase is a peroxisomal enzyme in human fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. The intracellular localization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (superoxide:superoxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.15.1.1) has been examined by immunofluorescence using four monoclonal anti-Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase antibodies raised against a recombinant human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase derivative produced and purified from Escherichia coli. Colocalization with catalase, a peroxisomal matrix enzyme, was used to demonstrate the peroxisomal localization of Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase in human fibroblasts and hepatoma cells. In the fibroblasts of Zellweger syndrome patients, the enzyme is not transported to the peroxisomal ghosts but, like catalase, remains in the cytoplasm. In addition, immunocryoelectron microscopy of yeast cells expressing human Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase showed that the enzyme is translocated to the peroxisomes. 
Adrenaline injection for endoscopic haemostasis in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. Over a 30-month period, 53 patients with actively bleeding non-variceal lesions of the oesophagus, stomach or duodenum were treated by endoscopic injection of 1/10,000 adrenaline. Initial haemostasis was obtained in 50 cases, and permanent haemostasis in 44. Emergency surgery for bleeding was required in nine patients overall, and there were four deaths. All lesions requiring surgery were located on the posterior wall of the duodenum or the lesser curve of the stomach, and all but one had evidence of an exposed arterial vessel. Adrenaline injection is an effective, safe and simple method of endoscopic haemostasis. 
Estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and heat-shock 27-kD protein in liver biopsy specimens from patients with hepatitis B virus infection. It has been proposed that in the human liver, the estrogen receptor gene may become inappropriately expressed as a consequence of HBV integration, contributing to cell transformation. This study was undertaken to examine estrogen receptor status in patients with hepatitis B virus infection and to analyze the expression of progesterone receptor and of a heat-shock 27,000-D protein (hsp27), both of which are estrogen regulated in estrogen target tissues. Receptor proteins were detected in liver biopsy specimens by immunocytochemistry using antireceptor monoclonal antibodies; a monoclonal antibody was also used to detect hsp27. Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor were mainly seen in the nuclei of hepatocytes. The presence of hepatitis B virus infection did not always result in elevated estrogen receptor expression, but in general the expression of this receptor protein was higher in hepatitis B virus-positive patients than in patients with the same pathological findings (hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma) but without hepatitis B virus. This was more clearly seen in the patients with hepatitis. Although estrogen receptor expression was moderate to high in many samples, the expression of the two biochemical markers of estrogen action at postreceptor levels (progesterone receptor and hsp27) was low or absent in most of the liver tissues examined, suggesting that in the liver the interaction of estrogen-estrogen receptor-DNA has characteristics inherent to this tissue. 
Fasting plasma glucose levels and endogenous androgens in non-diabetic postmenopausal women. 1. The clinical association between glucose intolerance, hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism is well recognized in premenopausal women with polycystic ovarian disease. We examined the hypothesis that fasting plasma glucose levels might be related to endogenous androgen levels in postmenopausal women in the absence of overt clinical disease. 2. In a Southern Californian cohort of 848 nondiabetic postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years, fasting plasma glucose levels positively correlated with levels of the endogenous androgens dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and free testosterone and negatively with sex-hormone-binding globulin across the whole range of glucose and hormone levels. Mean dihydroepiandrosterone sulphate and free testosterone levels were 16% and 46% higher, respectively, and mean sex-hormone-binding globulin levels 27% lower in the top compared with the bottom quartile of fasting plasma glucose levels. This relationship was independent of age, body mass index, cigarette smoking habit and exogenous oestrogen use. 3. These findings raise questions about the possible physiological role of androgens in the regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance and, possibly, in the mediation of the some of the cardiovascular consequences of diabetes in women. 
Pharyngeal function and snoring characteristics in apneic and nonapneic snorers. Abnormalities in pharyngeal function, manifested even when the patients are awake, are thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of sleep apnea. Tests of awake pharyngeal function continue to stimulate interest because it is hoped that they may allow physicians to distinguish patients with sleep apnea from those without it, and therefore reduce the number of unnecessary sleep studies. We elected to study two measures of pharyngeal function: changes in pharyngeal area with lung volume (PLVD) and changes in pharyngeal area in response to externally applied positive pressure, i.e., pharyngeal distensibility (Cph). Both measurements have been employed for assessment of pharyngeal function, and both are thought to reflect pharyngeal "floppiness." Measurement of PLVD is technically very simple, whereas the measurement of Cph is technically more complex. If the two measurements are highly correlated, it might be possible to replace the technically more difficult one by the simpler one. Consequently, the purpose of this study was two-fold: first, to examine the relationship between pharyngeal distensibility and lung volume dependence of pharyngeal area, and second, to compare these parameters in a large group of confirmed snorers with and without obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We studied 75 unselected patients referred for the investigation of snoring and suspected sleep apnea. All patients had nocturnal polysomnography, pulmonary function tests, and measurement of pharyngeal areas at TLC, FRC, and residual volume (RV) employing the acoustic reflection technique. The area measurement at FRC was performed at zero and at 4.1 cm H2O positive airway pressure to calculate pharyngeal distensibility. 
Ligamentous compression of the celiac axis: CT findings in five patients. Compression of the celiac trunk by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm is an uncommon angiographic and surgical finding that rarely may be symptomatic. We retrospectively reviewed contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans in five patients with severe ligamentous compression of the celiac axis, confirmed by surgery and/or angiography, and compared the findings with those of enhanced scans of 100 consecutive patients without known ligamentous compression. In all five patients with ligamentous celiac artery compression, CT showed effacement or narrowing of the celiac trunk by an anterior soft-tissue band. Dilated peripancreatic collateral vessels were seen in four cases, and poststenotic dilatation of the distal celiac trunk was seen in two cases. The normal appearance of the vasculature was seen in the majority (76%) of the 100 control subjects, but in eight patients the celiac origin was obscured on CT scans, and in 16 patients the celiac trunk appeared narrow or effaced. Our experience suggests that severe ligamentous celiac artery compression can be identified on CT. However, the isolated CT finding of effacement or obscuration of the celiac axis occurs sufficiently often in normal patients that it is not adequate evidence to establish the diagnosis of celiac artery compression. 
Tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells: endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 as an inducible adhesive receptor specific for colon carcinoma cells. Activation of endothelial cells by the two inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor strongly increases tumor cell adhesion. We describe antibody inhibition studies showing that the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), a cell-surface glycoprotein selectively expressed by cytokine-activated endothelial cells and responsible for neutrophil adhesion, is the major, if not the only, mediator of colon carcinoma cell adhesion to activated endothelial cells. Among the different tumor cell lines tested, seven colon carcinoma cell lines were sensitive to ELAM-1 antibodies. Adhesion of melanoma, osteosarcoma, and lung, cervix, or kidney carcinoma cell lines to IL-1-treated endothelial cells was not affected by the ELAM-1 antibody. This result suggests that ELAM-1 is selectively recognized by colon carcinoma cells and that adhesion of tumor cells to activated endothelial cells could be mediated by different and specific mechanisms. 
Effect of long-term enalapril therapy on cardiopulmonary exercise performance in men with mild heart failure and previous myocardial infarction. Forty-one men with documented myocardial infarction greater than 6 months previously were randomized to long-term (48 weeks) therapy with placebo or enalapril on a double-blind basis. All patients were receiving concurrent therapy with digitalis and a diuretic drug for symptomatic heart failure (functional class II or III). The mean age was 64 +/- 7.3 years and no patient suffered from exertional chest pain. Patients underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exertional chest pain. Patients underwent maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing to exhaustion on an ergometer cycle nine times over the course of 48 weeks. Gas exchange data were collected on a breath by breath basis with use of a continuous ramp protocol. In the placebo group (n = 21), the mean (+/- SD) peak oxygen consumption (VO2) at baseline was 18.8 +/- 5.2 versus 18.5 +/- 5.5 ml/kg per min at 48 weeks (-1.4%, p = NS). In the enalapril group (n = 20), the corresponding values were 18.1 +/- 3.1 versus 18.3 +/- 2.6 ml/kg per min (+2.8%, p = NS). The mean VO2 at the anaerobic threshold for the placebo group at baseline study was 13.1 +/- 3.5 versus 12.8 +/- 2.1 ml/kg per min at 48 weeks (-2.2%, p = NS). The corresponding values for the enalapril group were 11.8 +/- 2.3 versus 11.8 +/- 2.4 ml/kg per min (+1.4%, p = NS). The mean total exercise duration in the placebo group at baseline study was 589 +/- 153 versus 620 +/- 181 s at 48 weeks (+5.4%, p = NS). 
Dysfibrinogenemia associated with thrombosis and third-trimester fetal loss. A case report. Dysfibrinogenemias are rare genetic disorders that are clinically silent, cause a mild bleeding tendency or have thromboembolic manifestations. During pregnancy they often cause hemorrhage and first-trimester abortions. A patient with a severe thrombotic tendency during pregnancy had a third-trimester fetal loss. 
Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase expression in foetal skin, inflammatory dermatoses and cutaneous neoplasia. Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is an enzyme expressed by some epithelial neoplasms but not normal interfollicular epidermis. In order to examine the relationship between malignant change and de-differentiation we studied histochemically the expression of GGT in human foetal skin, various inflammatory dermatoses and epidermal neoplasms. In foetal skin GGT was detectable after 7 weeks' gestation, reached a maximum at 11 weeks and was undetectable by 24 weeks. It was expressed strongly by squamous cell carcinoma and focally in Bowen's disease and actinic keratoses. There was no GGT expression in basal cell carcinoma or most benign skin tumours, but keratoacanthomas were weakly positive. Keratinocytes in the vicinity of malignant melanocytes also expressed GGT. This study suggests that GGT expression, while not a simple marker of malignancy, may represent reversion to a less differentiated or 'foetal' phenotype. 
Primary orbital intraosseous hemangioma. Primary orbital intraosseous hemangiomas are rare--only 16 cases have been reported previously. The authors describe five patients with this benign tumor. Patients ranged in age from 49 to 77 years, and each had a painless or mildly tender nodular lesion. Ophthalmic symptoms were minimal, although nasolacrimal obstruction was the original sign in one patient. Four of five patients responded well to complete tumor excision (two patients) or partial resection of the lesion (two patients). The fifth patient required a second operation for tumor progression after partial excision of the hemangioma. The 16 previously reported cases of orbital intraosseous hemangioma are reviewed, and the natural history and pathology of this rare vascular lesion are discussed. 
Risks of untreated hypertension. A discussion [comment] There is a strong and graded association between blood pressure and the incidence of major coronary heart disease manifestations, congestive heart failure, stroke, and total mortality. The risk of any of these manifestations is also modified by other risk factors. Tobacco smoking affects the risk for all of the previously mentioned end points. Generally, lipid disturbances are only important predictors of coronary heart disease and total mortality. Several facts indicate that elevated blood pressure is causally related to the end points. There are, however, positive relations between blood pressure levels and heart rate, serum cholesterol level, body mass index, and, according to some studies, glucose intolerance. Some more basic abnormality may be responsible for the blood pressure increase and the increases in these other factors. Hypothetically, this abnormality may be more fundamentally related to some of the end points than is hypertension itself. If that is the case, then the type of antihypertensive treatment may be of decisive importance. Different end points may be affected differently by antihypertensive drugs, a factor that may be essential in the choice of drug treatment. Proper management of other risk factors is also essential in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. 
High-dose epinephrine improves the return of spontaneous circulation rates in human victims of cardiac arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the return of spontaneous circulation (RSC) rates in human victims of cardiac arrest treated with standard doses of epinephrine (SDE) or high-dose epinephrine (HDE). DESIGN: Prospective case series. SETTING: A university hospital emergency department during 1987 through 1989. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine adult victims of nontraumatic cardiac arrest. INTERVENTIONS: At the discretion of the treating physician, patients received epinephrine in bolus doses ranging from 1 to 15 mg. HDE was defined as a dose of at least 0.2 mg/kg; smaller doses were defined as SDE. Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. MEASUREMENTS: Patients were grouped as +RSC if they developed a sustained spontaneous palpable pulse or blood pressure and as -RSC if they did not develop a pulse or blood pressure. Patients were also grouped by their presenting rhythm. Potentially perfusing rhythm was electromechanical dissociation or ventricular tachycardia. Nonperfusing rhythm was asystole or ventricular fibrillation. Rates were analyzed using the Fisher exact test and the two-tailed unpaired t test. HDE improved the rate of initial resuscitation (P = .008). The effect was greatest in patients with nonperfusing rhythms (P = .014) and disappeared when evaluating patients with potentially perfusing rhythms. No patient survived to hospital discharge. CONCLUSION: High-dose epinephrine improves initial resuscitation rates in human victims of cardiac arrest. Its greatest effect is in patients with a nonperfusing rhythm. 
Intratemporal facial nerve hemangiomas. Facial nerve hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that arise within the temporal bone and have a histologic appearance similar to both cavernous hemangiomas and vascular malformations. In contrast to facial nerve schwannomas, these are extraneural tumors that cause symptoms by compression and tend to produce deficits when very small in size. We report our experience at the House Ear Clinic with 34 patients having these nonglomus intratemporal vascular tumors. Hemangiomas arising in the internal auditory canal tend to produce a progressive sensorineural hearing loss and are demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas those at the geniculate ganglion are usually first seen with facial nerve symptoms and may require high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) for detection. Facial electromyography is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. Because of their extraneural nature, early diagnosis can permit removal of the tumor with preservation of facial nerves in some patients. 
Prevention of arrhythmias after noncardiac thoracic operations: flecainide versus digoxin. Cardiac arrhythmias are known complications of thoracic operations. The prophylactic value of flecainide administered as a constant-rate, intravenous infusion (0.15 mg.kg-1.h-1) after a loading dose (2 mg.kg-1) was compared with digoxin (10 micrograms.kg-1 for 12 hours, then 0.25 mg.24 h-1) in a randomized study in 30 patients using Holter monitoring during the first 72 hours after operation. Drug monitoring was performed every day to keep a serum level of flecainide of 200 to 600 ng.mL-1 and a digoxin level of 0.8 to 2 ng.mL-1. Failure, defined as the appearance of atrial fibrillation or flutter or the development of complex ventricular arrhythmias (Lown IVb and V), was observed in one patient in the flecainide group (7%) and in 7 patients in the digoxin group (47%) (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that flecainide is more efficient than digoxin in preventing and treating cardiac arrhythmias after thoracic operations. At the dosage used side effects related to flecainide or digoxin were not observed. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: results of an early experience. Ninety consecutive patients over a 6-month period with acute (31 patients) or chronic (59 patients) cholecystitis underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on an ambulatory (49 patients), one-night (33 patients), or two-night (5 patients) basis. Three patients required open procedures for 1) perforated duodenal ulcer at 48 h, postoperatively, 2) a cholecystoduodenal fistula, and 3) Mirizzis syndrome with erosion of the common duct. The procedure is safe, efficacious, and should be offered to patients with acute and chronic biliary disease. 
Dysmegakaryopoiesis resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in treated acute myeloid leukemia. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by trilineage dysplasia, including atypical megakaryocytes. Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (FAB M7) is particularly associated with atypical megakaryocytic hyperplasia (AMH). Fifteen patients with nonmegakaryoblastic AML developed AMH after therapy, comprising 12.6% of cases of AML diagnosed from 1986 to 1989. Platelet counts were normal in nine patients and decreased in six. Blasts comprised less than 5% of cells in 40% of the biopsies, ranged from 5-15% in 53%, and comprised more than 30% of cells in 7%. Numerous small hypo- and hyperlobated megakaryocytes were seen in all specimens, often occurring in clusters, and were more easily seen in sections than in smears. Subsequent biopsies in 13 patients showed a remission marrow in seven, increased blasts in three, and AML in three; none showed AMH. AMH resembling acute megakaryoblastic leukemia may be seen transiently after treatment of AML. 
Etiology of autism: genetic influences. In summary, there are a few specific genetic conditions that can be associated with autism. Among cases of unknown etiology, there is ample evidence for a higher genetic liability to autism in siblings of autistic probands than expected from the population prevalence. It appears likely that both parents and siblings have a higher liability for social and cognitive deficits that are milder but conceptually similar to those found in autism. Others factors may alter this underlying genetic liability such as sex, IQ, and prenatal and perinatal injury. In the future, genetic analyses and genetic linkage studies will need to consider using a broader definition of the autism phenotype to include not only autism but severe cognitive and social deficits. The exact genetic mechanisms and genes involved are the subject of current investigations by several research groups. Investigations in this area are likely to continue to provide important information about the causes of autism. 
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies in childhood. II. Clinical manifestations and syndromes. During a 4-year period 1984 to 1988, 20 children referred with manifestations of central nervous system or neuromuscular disease combined with hyperlactatemia were found to have a mitochondrial disease. Each diagnosis was based on the results of thorough biochemical and morphologic investigations. The patients were separated into one series with mainly encephalopathy (n = 14) and another with mainly myopathy (n = 6). The patients with encephalopathy had the following syndromes: Kearns-Sayre (n = 2), MERRF (myoclonus epilepsy and ragged red fibers; n = 2), MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes; n = 3), Alpers (n = 3), Leigh (n = 1), and other variants (n = 3). In patients with myopathy, three had hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy. Ultrastructural abnormalities of mitochondria were the most common morphologic changes in the muscle biopsies. Complex I deficiency was most common in the patients with encephalopathy. All of the patients with myopathy had complex IV deficiency. Mutations of mitochondrial DNA were found in six patients with encephalopathy. We conclude that identification of defects at the DNA level and determination of the phenotypic expression with clinical, morphologic, and biochemical methods are fundamental for future rational classification of mitochondrial disorders. 
Juvenile fibromatosis of the orbit: a case report with review of the literature. Proliferation of fibrous tissues to form a localised mass with infiltrating margins may occur anywhere in the body; involvement of the orbit is rare. Children and young adults are most commonly affected. The term 'juvenile fibromatosis' is one of several synonyms. Of the two main forms of this entity, the solitary form is the more common and the prognosis is good. The multicentric form has a poor prognosis. The patients described, a 2 1/2-year-old boy, had a solitary nodule of juvenile fibromatosis removed from the right orbit and was asymptomatic 2 3/4 years postoperatively. 
Ultrasonic detection of parathyroid adenomas. High-resolution real time sonography was used to evaluate patients with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism. A total of 12 consecutive patients was scanned pre-operatively. The sensitivity of the procedure was 92% and the specificity 97%. In our hospital sonography is the procedure of choice for localizing enlarged parathyroid glands prior to surgical exploration. 
A comparison between heparin and low-dose aspirin as adjunctive therapy with tissue plasminogen activator for acute myocardial infarction. Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial (HART) Investigators BACKGROUND. We report the results of the Heparin-Aspirin Reperfusion Trial, a collaborative study comparing early intravenous heparin with oral aspirin as adjunctive treatment when recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is used for coronary thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction. METHODS. Two hundred five patients were randomly assigned to receive either immediate and then continuous intravenous heparin (starting with a 5000-unit bolus; n = 106) or immediate and then daily oral aspirin (80 mg; n = 99) together with rt-PA (100 mg intravenously over a six-hour period) initiated within six hours of the onset of symptoms. We evaluated the patency of the infarct-related artery by angiography 7 to 24 hours after beginning rt-PA infusion, the frequency of reocclusion of the artery by repeat angiography on day 7, and ischemic or hemorrhagic complications during the hospital stay. RESULTS. At the time of the first angiogram, 82 percent of the infarct-related arteries in the patients assigned to heparin were patent, as compared with only 52 percent in the aspirin group (P less than 0.0001). Of the initially patent vessels, 88 percent remained patent after seven days in the heparin group, as compared with 95 percent in the aspirin group (P not significant). The numbers of hemorrhagic events (18 in the heparin and 15 in the aspirin group) and recurrent ischemic events (8 in the heparin and 2 in the aspirin group) were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. Coronary patency rates associated with rt-PA are higher with early concomitant systemic heparin treatment than with concomitant low-dose oral aspirin. This observation has important implications for clinical practice and should be considered in the design and interpretation of clinical trials involving coronary thrombolytic therapy. 
Impaired binding properties of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease. To determine the factors underlying the apparent reduction in binding ability of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma, hormone-binding characteristics were further examined in patients with this disease and in control subjects. No differences in affinity constants with respect to triodothyronine or serum thyroxine-binding globulin from hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhotic and normal subjects were found. The affinity for thyroxine was significantly reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.41 +/- 0.13 x 10(10) mol-1) and cirrhotic (0.65 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) mol-1) patients compared with normal subjects (0.94 +/- 0.7 x 10(10) mol-1). Investigations carried out on liver tissue obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease showed that thyroxine-binding globulin within tumor tissue was elevated and bound less exogenous tracer hormone compared with that obtained from nontumor tissue. Tumor-derived thyroxine-binding globulin with altered binding properties is, at least partly, responsible for the abnormal behavior of the serum protein in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Characterization of liver epithelial cells transfected with myc and/or ras oncogenes. While many liver tumors contain activated myc and ras oncogenes, the mechanisms by which these genes contribute to cellular transformation is poorly understood. Activated versions of the cellular oncogenes, c-myc and/or c-H-ras were transfected into normal rat liver epithelial cells to identify cellular pathways that are altered in the cells containing the oncogenes. The results of these and other investigations indicate that the biological properties associated with the transfection of c-myc include immortalization, reduced contact inhibition of growth, activation of phospholipase A2-mediated pathways, increased sensitivity to transformation with a ras gene, and greatly increased sensitivity to growth factors. The biological properties associated with the transfection of the ras gene include morphological transformation, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenicity, increased phosphatidylinositol metabolism, the induction of growth-factor processing and secretion, which leads to (exogenous) growth factor-independent tumor growth, and a marked resistance to normal inhibitors of growth such as TGF-beta. It is proposed that the complementary actions of the myc and ras genes in cellular transformation may be related to the ras-induced secretion of autocrine growth factors by cells sensitized to their effects by the myc gene. The increased stimulus for growth coupled to a ras-induced insensitivity to growth inhibitors may lead to clonal expansion of these cells and tumor development. 
Fatal tonsillar herniation in pseudotumor cerebri. A 27-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri died after lumbar puncture secondary to tonsillar herniation. Five years earlier she had a respiratory arrest after lumbar puncture. MRI and autopsy ruled out the presence of an Arnold-Chiari malformation or a mass lesion of the posterior fossa, but midsagittal views suggested the presence of low-lying cerebellar tonsils. 
Mastoid surgery in childhood. The presenting features and operative findings in 105 patients aged 16 years or less undergoing mastoid surgery are reviewed. In 94% surgery was for chronic otomastoiditis, usually acquired, and associated with cholesteatoma in 64%. Post-operative otorrhoea persisted beyond 6 months in 44% and contralateral disease required some form of surgical procedure in 20%. Post-operative hearing thresholds were improved or unchanged in the majority of patients, most of whom underwent cortical or modified radical mastoidectomy. An improvement in the therapeutic results of mastoid surgery in childhood is clearly necessary, but requires a greater understanding of the aetiology of chronic middle ear disease. 
Primary small-cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Report of 11 cases and review of the literature. Primary small-cell carcinoma of the esophagus is an uncommon esophageal malignancy. This report details the clinical and pathologic aspects of 11 cases seen at our institution over 20 years, as well as 123 other cases reported in the literature. Small-cell carcinomas of the esophagus show considerable histologic heterogeneity. Neurosecretory granules can be found in the majority of cases and some show evidence of multidifferentiation. Like primary small-cell cancers of the lung, those in the esophagus are highly aggressive, are usually associated with spread at the time of diagnosis, and have a dismal prognosis regardless of treatment. The possible origin of this interesting variety of esophageal neoplasm is also discussed. 
Vulvar vestibulitis: prevalence and historic features in a general gynecologic practice population. All gynecologic patients seen by the author during a 6-month period were questioned and examined by means of a swab test to determine the prevalence of vulvar vestibulitis and the normal variation in sensitivity of vestibular skin. Of 210 patients, 78 (37%) had some degree of positive testing. A total of 31 patients (15%) were found to fulfill the definition of vulvar vestibulitis. A questionnaire was administered to these patients as well as to seven patients in whom vestibulitis had been previously diagnosed. A total of 50% had always had pain, most since their teenage years. Their history was not suggestive of a cyclic or remittent pattern of symptoms. Those with secondary dyspareunia or resolution of pain were usually either in a post partum phase or had group B streptococcus or human papillomavirus. The two most severe cases of vestibulitis occurred after use of fluoroucil cream. A total of 32% had some female relative with dyspareunia or tampon intolerance, raising the issue of a genetic predisposition. 
Posterior cortical dementia with alexia: neurobehavioural, MRI, and PET findings. A progressive disorder of relatively focal but asymmetric biposterior dysfunction is described in a 54 year old right handed male. Initial clinical features included letter-by-letter alexia, visual anomia, acalculia, mild agraphia, constructional apraxia, and visuospatial compromise. Serial testing demonstrated relentless deterioration with additional development of transcortical sensory aphasia, Gerstmann's tetrad, and severe visuoperceptual impairment. Amnesia was not an early clinical feature. Judgment, personality, insight, and awareness remained preserved throughout most of the clinical course. Extinction in the right visual field to bilateral stimulation was the sole neurological abnormality. Early CT was normal and late MRI showed asymmetrical bioccipitoparietal atrophy with greater involvement of the left hemisphere. Results from positron emission tomography (PET) showed bilaterally asymmetric (left greater than right) occipitotemporoparietal hypometabolism. The metabolic decrement was strikingly asymmetric with a 50% reduction in glucose consumption confined to the left occipital cortex. The picture of occipitotemporoparietal compromise verified by MRI, PET, and neurobehavioural testing would be unusual for such degenerative dementias as Alzheimer's (AD) and Pick's disease, although atypical AD with predominant occipital lobe involvement cannot be excluded. This case supports the concepts of posterior cortical dementia (PCD) as a clinically distinct entity and for the first time documents its corresponding metabolic deficit using PET. 
Acute phosphate depletion dissociates hormonal stimulated second messengers in osteoblast-like cells. The acute effect (24 h) of either phosphate depletion or phosphate surfeit on hormonal stimulated signal transduction systems was studied in the osteoblastic cell line UMR-106. Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in), induced by different calciotropic hormones (PTH, prostaglandin E2, endothelin) was blunted by acute phosphate depletion, whereas at high inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations the rise in [Ca2+]in was augmented. Basal [Ca2+]in was not altered by either Pi depletion or Pi excess. The effect of acute phosphate depletion on hormonal mediated [Ca2+]in rise was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ suggesting that under these conditions, the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, is not affected. Also, nonhormonal calcium entry pathways such as depolarization-activated calcium channels or protein kinase C-activated Ca2+ channels were not affected by acute phosphate depletion. cAMP accumulation in the cells, either through receptor or nonreceptor-mediated mechanisms, increased under low Pi conditions and decreased as Pi concentration in the culture media was progressively increased from 0 to 2 mM during 24 h of incubation. Changes in Pi concentration had no effect on basal cAMP generation by the cells. The facilitative effect of acute Pi depletion on agonist-induced cAMP accumulation could be demonstrated in both the presence and absence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.2 mM). PTH receptor binding assessed with [Nle8 Nle18 Tyr34] bovine PTH (1-34) NH2 was not altered by phosphate depletion. We conclude that exposure of osteoblasts to different Pi environments modulates the second messenger responses to hormones in a reciprocal fashion so that acute phosphate depletion down-regulates [Ca2+]in signals while augmenting cAMP generation and vice versa. Inasmuch as bone resorption processes can be modulated by Ca2+ and cAMP the data presented herein suggest that the altered bone resorptive response to calciotropic hormones (e.g. PTH), under surfeit or deficit of phosphate, is mediated by changes in [Ca2+]in and cAMP. 
Acute cholangitis secondary to hepatolithiasis. In a series of 88 patients with acute cholangitis secondary to hepatolithiasis, 26 (30%) required emergency therapeutic intervention because of septicemic shock (n = 15), persistent fever (n = 8), or spreading peritonitis (n = 3). Analysis was made to define factors that predisposed to failure of conservative treatment and characteristics that could predict the need for emergency biliary decompression. The age, incidence of concomitant medical diseases, previous biliary surgery, positive blood culture, bacterial strains resistant to antibiotics used, and multiplicity of bacterial strains in bile cultures in patients who required emergency intervention were similar to these factors in patients who had elective operations after successful conservative management. The incidence of intrahepatic segmental obstruction by stones or strictures was similar, but many more patients who required emergency intervention had concomitant extrahepatic obstruction due to impacted common ductal stones or strictures. Logistic regression analysis of clinical, hematological, and biochemical data showed that maximum pulse rate within 24 hours of presentation (greater than 100 beats per minute, relative risk, 2.8) and platelet count at the time of admission (less than 150 x 10(9)/L, relative risk, 5.2) were the factors with independent significance in predicting the need for emergency therapeutic procedures. This finding may serve as a guideline for identifying high-risk patients for early intervention. 
Update on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The major components of atherosclerotic plaque, ultimately responsible for clinical effects, are deposited lipids--mostly cholesteryl esters and cholesterol, derived largely from the lower-density lipoproteins of the blood--and proliferated, modified arterial smooth muscle cells with their synthesized connective tissue products. Advanced plaques vary widely in the proportion of the two components, but evidence indicates that lipid deposition--especially of lipoprotein elements--often occurs in the lesion-prone intimal areas of the artery prior to the buildup of smooth muscle cells. The 1980s were remarkably productive for investigators who study the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. We now know of the many forms of lower-density lipoproteins, i.e., low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), some of which are more likely to be associated with accelerated atherosclerosis and some of which are more likely to be influenced by diet. Among these forms of LDL and VLDL are LDL-1, beta-VLDL, and Lp(a). Work has been reported implicating various alterations of endothelial function in the permeability of the arterial endothelial barrier in the transport of these low-density, cholesterol-rich macromolecules. Of possibly greater interest is the developing evidence that such proliferation-stimulating molecules as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) can be produced by a number of cells likely to be involved in the progression of atherosclerotic plaque. In addition to platelets, these include activated monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages, injured endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells, which can undergo an autocrine conversion to PDGF synthesis--possibly stimulated by LDL from hyperlipidemic serum. Leukotrienes and other endothelium-associated regulatory molecules may also take part in the paracrine and autocrine mechanisms of stimulating smooth-muscle-cell proliferation. Additional recent developments that have led to a better understanding of atherosclerotic pathogenesis have occurred. The first is evidence of the involvement of oxidized LDL and its apolipoprotein B in atherogenesis. Research indicates that antioxidants have a suppressive effect on atherogenesis when oxidized LDL has been involved in lesion development. The data linking the development of autoimmune reactions to these oxidatively altered lipoproteins are also impressive. Further, there is increasing evidence that atherogenesis in nonhuman primates and in people in whom chronic sustained circulating immune complexes are involved is likely to be accelerated, even when few or no classic risk factors are present. These lesions appear to represent a distinct microarchitectural form of concentric and transmural atherosclerosis that is better classified as "atheroarteritis.". 
Lack of predictive value of the APACHE II score in hypoalbuminemic patients. The APACHE II score predicts mortality in severely ill patients. This score does not account for the serum albumin level. Ninety-three patients (28 with serum albumin levels less than 2.5 g/dL [group I] and 65 with serum albumin levels greater than or equal to 2.5 [group II]) were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were comparable in age, APACHE II score, and compliance with required protein needs. Patients with severe hypoalbuminemia had nearly double the death rate of patients with mildly low or normal albumin concentrations (54% compared with 29%). The death rate in the severely hypoalbuminemic patients was 5.1-fold higher than would be predicted by their APACHE II score. The death rate in those patients with mildly low or normal albumin levels had only a 1.9-fold higher rate than would be predicted by their APACHE II score. It is concluded that severe hypoalbuminemia increases the risk of death significantly higher than would be predicted by the APACHE II score. APACHE II score is not as accurate in a severely hypoalbuminemic population. 
Preservation of aortic valve in type A aortic dissection complicated by aortic regurgitation. Two hundred fifty-two patients underwent operation for type A aortic dissection at Stanford University Medical Center from 1963 to 1987 and Duke University Medical Center from 1975 to 1988. Sixty-seven percent had an acute type A dissection and 33% had a chronic type A dissection. In addition to repair or replacement of the ascending aorta, 121 patients (48%) required an aortic valve procedure. Valve resuspension was performed in 46 (39 acute type A and 7 chronic type A), with an operative mortality rate of 13% +/- 5% (+/- 70% confidence limits), and aortic valve replacement in 75 (36 acute type A and 39 chronic type A), with an operative mortality rate of 20% +/- 5% (p = not significant versus resuspension). The operative mortality rate for patients requiring only repair or replacement of the ascending aorta was 32% +/- 4%. Indications for valve replacement included coexistent (nonacute) aortic valve disease, Marfan's syndrome, annuloaortic ectasia, and cases in which successful resuspension could not be accomplished. The overall actuarial survival rate for all patients was 59% +/- 3% (+/- 1 standard error of the mean), 40% +/- 4%, and 25% +/- 5% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Survival rates at these same times for patients with valve resuspension were 67% +/- 8%, 52% +/- 10%, and 26% +/- 19%, respectively; for patients who required aortic valve replacement, these survival rates were 70% +/- 5%, 39% +/- 8%, and 21% +/- 11%; finally, patients who received only an ascending aortic procedure had survival probabilities of 51% +/- 5%, 37% +/- 6%, and 23% +/- 6% (p = not significant versus resuspension versus aortic valve replacement). Multivariate analysis showed advanced age (p less than 0.001), previous cardiac or aortic operation (p less than 0.001), more preoperative dissection complications (p = 0.002), and earlier operative date (p = 0.038) to be the only significant, independent factors that increased the likelihood of early or late death. The type of aortic valve procedure (resuspension versus aortic valve replacement versus none) was not a significant predictor of mortality. Two of 46 patients with valve resuspension required late aortic valve replacement (freedom from aortic valve replacement: 100% and 80% +/- 13% at 5 and 10 years, respectively), as did 4 of 75 patients with initial aortic valve replacement (freedom from repeat aortic valve replacement: 98% +/- 2% and 73% +/- 13%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Fetal breathing and development of control of breathing. Technical advances during the last several decades have greatly facilitated research into fetal physiology and behavior, specifically fetal breathing (FB). Breathing movements have been demonstrated in the fetuses of every mammalian species investigated and appear to be part of normal fetal development. In this review we focus on the methods of measuring FB and on some of the problems associated with these measurements and their interpretation. We also review fetal behavior, the role of the peripheral and central chemoreceptors in spontaneous FB, the fetal respiratory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia, and the transition to continuous breathing at birth. It is clear that in many ways the control of breathing movements in utero differs from that after birth. In particular, inhibitory influences are much more prominent before than after birth. Possibly this is due to the unique fetal situation, in which conservation of energy may be more important than any advantage breathing activity imparts to the fetus. 
Histological and immunohistochemical study of the gall bladder lesion in primary sclerosing cholangitis. The histological features and type of mononuclear cell infiltrate in gall bladders from six patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were studied using routine staining techniques and immunohistochemistry. Control studies were performed using the gall bladders from six patients (age and sex matched) with chronic cholecystitis and four with primary biliary cirrhosis. A range of histological abnormalities was present in gall bladders from patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis including a mild to moderate degree of epithelial hyperplasia, pseudogland formation, and mononuclear cell infiltrate of the epithelium; moderate to severe chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate and fibrosis affecting the superficial and deep layers of the gall bladder wall; and minimal smooth muscle hypertrophy. These abnormalities were non-specific and were also present in gall bladders from patients with chronic cholecystitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Vasculitis and granulomas were not present in the patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the superficial and deep mononuclear cell infiltrate in primary sclerosing cholangitis gall bladders was composed predominantly of lymphocytes, in contrast to chronic cholecystitis where macrophages were found in similar or greater numbers. Moreover, T lymphocytes (activated and resting) were present throughout the lymphocytic infiltrate and were apposed to the base and interdigitated between the biliary epithelial cells in significantly greater numbers than in chronic cholecystitis gall bladders. B lymphocytes were present only in lymphoid follicles. Comparative studies using liver biopsy specimens from three of the primary sclerosing cholangitis patients showed a similar T lymphocyte portal tract infiltrate. 
Testolactone, sulindac, warfarin, and vitamin K1 for unresectable desmoid tumors. Ten patients with large inoperable desmoid tumors in various body locations were treated with testolactone. Four tumors (40%) responded with major regressions, i.e., more than 50% reduction in volume. Eight patients received nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, sulindac, or sulindac with warfarin and vitamin K1 [Mephyton]) for periods of 2 to 91 months. There was one major regression, one partial regression, and three instances of tumor growth arrest over periods up to 8 years. Seven patients were treated with nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs concurrent with or after testolactone or tamoxifen. There were five major regressions and one partial regression with extensive central necrosis of an enormous intra-abdominal tumor. The last patient has been treated for only 12 months, with no change in tumor volume. It appears that estrogens function as growth factors for desmoid tumors, and that minimization of these effects inhibits tumor growth in some, but not all, cases. In those instances where antiestrogens were not effective as single agents, the tumors usually responded to subsequent nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Withdrawal of estrogen may be followed by inhibition of transcription of genes that support tumor cell proliferation, and sulindac and indomethacin may augment these effects by inhibiting prostaglandin and cyclic AMP synthesis and the activity of protein kinase C. Warfarin may function as a protonophore to acidify the cytoplasm and prevent the alkalinization that is necessary to initiate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, again an impairment of the transcription process. 
The clinical heterogeneity of hypertension. More than the character of the blood pressure elevation, the cardiovascular risk profile should be the prognostic guide for antihypertensive therapeutic decision-making. Hypertension tends to occur in association with other risk factors which augment the risk and need to be considered in evaluating the hazard of hypertension, the urgency for treatment, and the choice of treatment. Elevated blood pressure is often accompanied by blood lipid abnormality, obesity, electrocardiograph (ECG) abnormality, glucose intolerance, and elevated fibrinogen and hematocrit, all of which enhance the risk of cardiovascular sequelae of hypertension. Hypertensive patients at particularly increased risk of cardiovascular events are those with an increased total/HDL-cholesterol ratio, ECG abnormality, impaired glucose tolerance, or the cigarette smoking habit. The risk of a cardiovascular event among hypertensive patients varies over more than a 10-fold range depending on the number of these coexistent risk factors. Multivariate risk formulations are available to allow a composite estimate of the joint conditional probability of a cardiovascular outcome in hypertensive patients with multiple risk factors. Since some antihypertensive agents can adversely affect blood lipids, glucose tolerance, or uric acid values, the risk profile must also be taken into account in choosing the optimal antihypertensive therapy. Also, hypertension is commonly associated with angina, myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, stroke, or cardiac failure. These too must be taken under consideration in judging the urgency for treatment and the choice of agents. Thus, hypertension is best regarded as a component of a cardiovascular risk profile in implementing optimal therapy and in assessing its efficacy. 
Comparative efficacy of daptomycin, vancomycin, and cloxacillin for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis in rats and role of test conditions in this determination. The in vivo efficacy of daptomycin, a new cell wall-active anti-gram-positive-bacterial agent, was compared to those of cloxacillin and vancomycin in a rat model of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis. Both methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains were used. When therapy was initiated early (8 h) after infection, at the time when valvular bacterial counts were relatively low (approximately 10(6) CFU/g of vegetation), 3 days of therapy was found to be effective against the MSSA strains whatever the antibiotic regimen. In contrast, when the onset of therapy was delayed up to 15 h after infection, so that higher bacterial counts could develop on the valves (approximately 10(9) CFU/g of vegetation), a longer period of treatment (6 days) was required to cure infection. Under these conditions after 3 days of therapy, daptomycin was more effective than cloxacillin and vancomycin against the MSSA strains. Similarly, daptomycin showed a greater activity than vancomycin against the MRSA strain after 3 days of treatment, but after 6 days both antibiotics were equally effective. Decreasing doses of daptomycin showed decreasing activity: 10 mg/kg of body weight every 12 h (q12h) was better than 5 mg/kg q12h, whereas 5 mg/kg q24h (providing drug levels in blood detectable only during the first 12 h) failed to cure infection. In vitro, daptomycin was highly bactericidal at high concentrations (25 and 60 micrograms/ml, corresponding to peak levels in serum after doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and bacteriostatic at lower concentrations (0.5 to 2.5 micrograms/ml, corresponding to trough levels in serum). 
9p monosomy in a patient with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit disorder. Family studies support the presence of an autosomal dominant gene; however, to date, an assignment for the GTS locus has not been made. We present the case of a boy with GTS and a deletion of the terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 9, del(9)(qter----p2304:). 
Are there interactions and relations between genetic and environmental factors predisposing to high blood pressure? An overview of published observations suggests that both genetic predisposition and environment work together to produce hypertension in most persons. High blood pressure before age 55 occurs 3.8 times more often among persons with a strong positive family history of high blood pressure. Much of the total variability in blood pressure in modern populations seems attributable to genetic factors. Estimates of the proportion of the variance attributable to all genetic factors (heritability [H2]) vary from 25% in pedigree studies to 65% in twin studies for sitting diastolic blood pressure. Several biochemical traits associated with high blood pressure are highly genetic (H2, 78-84%) and may help elucidate the pathophysiology of high blood pressure. While pertinent environmental factors such as salt intake, alcohol use, and amount of exercise also correlate significantly among relatives, only 7% of the total variance of diastolic blood pressure seems attributable to all shared environmental factors in family households. Thus most familial aggregation of high blood pressure appears to be due to genes rather than shared family environment. Practical benefit may result from identifying familial predisposition in multiple siblings with high blood pressure before age 55 and lipid abnormalities (labeled "familial dyslipidemic hypertension"). About 12% of high blood pressure patients have familial dyslipidemic hypertension and also have high risk of early coronary heart disease.
