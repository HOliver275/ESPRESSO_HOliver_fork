Prevention of stress-induced erosive gastritis by parenteral administration of arachidonic acid. Stress-induced mucosal ulcerations are associated with a decreased synthesis of mucosal prostaglandin (PG) E2. This phenomenon is poorly understood. To investigate whether it is due to a decreased availability of the necessary substrates to the mucosa, four groups of 10 Holtzman rats were studied: group 1 received normal saline by intraperitoneal (ip) injection; group 2 also received ip normal saline, then were submitted to stress, by the cold restraint method; group 3 received a solution of arachidonic acid (AA) ip; and group 4 also received ip AA, then were submitted to stress. After sacrifice, the number of gastric ulcerations were counted and specimens of nonulcerated mucosa were assayed for PGE2 by high-performance liquid chromatography; the mean numbers of ulcers were 0, 5.8, 0.8, and 3 and the mean levels of PGE2 were 55, 41, 125, and 62 pg/mg of wet tissue for groups 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It is concluded that parenteral administration of AA reduces but does not completely eliminate stress-induced gastric ulcerations and that the stressed animals synthesized half as much PGE2 as the nonstressed ones after ip administration of equal amounts of AA, suggesting that stress reduces the availability of AA to the gastric mucosa, possibly by vascular spasm. 
A technique to accurately construct a contact dressing. We describe a technique to rapidly and accurately construct the contact layer of a composite dressing. This technique is simple to perform and is suitable for any open wound. It is especially useful for moderately sized wounds created during extirpation of tumors by Mohs micrographic surgery. 
The outcome of decompressive laminectomy for degenerative lumbar stenosis. The outcome of laminectomy for the relief of symptoms resulting from degenerative lumbar stenosis is not well established. Eighty-eight consecutive patients who had had a laminectomy for degenerative lumbar stenosis between 1983 and 1986 were studied. Eight of the patients had had a concomitant arthrodesis. The follow-up evaluation included a review of charts and standardized questionnaires that were completed by the patients. One year postoperatively, five patients (6 per cent) had had a second operation and five still had severe pain. By the time of the latest follow-up, in 1989, fifteen (17 per cent) of the original eighty-eight patients had had a repeat operation because of instability or stenosis; twenty-one (30 per cent) of the seventy patients who were evaluated by questionnaire in 1989 had severe pain. The factors found to be associated with a poor long-term outcome, defined as severe pain or the need for a repeat operation, or both, included co-existing illnesses (such as osteoarthrosis, cardiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic pulmonary disease) (p = 0.004), the duration of follow-up (p = 0.01), and an initial laminectomy involving a single interspace (p = 0.04). We concluded that the long-term outcome of decompressive laminectomy is less favorable than has been previously reported, and that co-morbidity and a single-interspace laminectomy are risk factors for a poor outcome. 
Cortical evoked potentials by stimulation of the vesicourethral junction: clinical value and neurophysiological considerations. In 21 healthy volunteers and 42 patients with either neurogenic bladder dysfunction (24), partial peripheral denervation of the bladder (12) or nonneurogenic bladder dysfunction (6) scalp-derived evoked potentials after stimulation of the vesicourethral junction (cortical evoked potentials) were recorded. In addition, evoked potentials from the posterior tibial nerve (tibial somatosensory evoked potentials) and from the pudendal nerve (pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials) were evaluated. The results obtained in normal subjects were reproducible and comparable to those reported in previous studies. Cortical evoked potentials of vesicourethral junction consisted of a prominent negativity with a mean latency of 95 msec. Tibial and pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials were similar and showed a typical W-shaped complex. In normal subjects stimulation of the vesicourethral junction was described as a stimulus-synchronous pulsation combined with a continuous burning feeling and sometimes with a desire to void. In 4 normal subjects no cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction could be obtained because of a decreased pain threshold. In regard to clinical value, the results demonstrate that in patients with lesions of the central nervous system (in the group with cauda equina and conus medullaris lesions, and in the group with suprasacral spinal cord lesions) the results of cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction and pudendal somatosensory evoked potentials widely correlate due to similar afferent nervous pathways within the central nervous system. However, in patients with partial peripheral denervation of the bladder with suspected additional secondary local detrusor damage the results of cortical evoked potentials obtained by stimulation of the vesicourethral junction differ mostly from the results of somatosensory evoked potentials obtained by stimulation of the pudendal nerve. The pattern obtained (increased sensory and pain threshold, normal cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction with normal latencies and normal or increased amplitude) is indicative of local detrusor damage. In 21 patients the ability to detect cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction was combined with the sensation of stimulus-synchronous pulsation, whereas in the other 21 patients the absence of this sensation during stimulation was combined with the absence of cortical evoked potentials. On the other hand, no correlation was found between the ability of obtaining cortical evoked potentials of the vesicourethral junction and the stimulus-induced sensation of pain and/or desire to void.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Abnormal small bowel permeability and duodenitis in recurrent abdominal pain. Thirty nine children with recurrent abdominal pain aged between 5.5 and 12 years, underwent endoscopic duodenal biopsy to find out if there were any duodenal inflammatory changes, and if there was a relationship between duodenal inflammation and intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA. Duodenal inflammation was graded by the duodenitis scale of Whitehead et al (grade 0, 1, 2, and 3). In 13 out of 39 patients (33%) definite signs of inflammation were found (grade 2 and 3). Intestinal permeability to 51Cr-EDTA in patients with duodenitis (grade 1, 2, and 3) was significantly higher (4.42 (1.73)%) than in patients with normal (grade 0) duodenal biopsy appearances (3.3 (0.9)%). A significant association was found between duodenal inflammation and abnormal intestinal permeability. Our results give further evidence that there is an intestinal origin of these patients' complaints. 
Surgical treatment of limbic epilepsy associated with extrahippocampal lesions: the problem of dual pathology. The authors present their review of 178 patients who underwent en bloc temporal lobectomies as surgical treatment for intractable epilepsy. Hippocampal cell density was quantitatively analyzed and the histology of the anterior temporal lobe was reviewed. Fifty-four patients (30.3%) had evidence of extrahippocampal lesions in addition to neuronal cell loss within the hippocampus (the dual pathology group). The pattern of cell loss was analyzed in the remaining 124 cases (69.7%) with no extrahippocampal pathology, and compared with that of the dual pathology group and a control group of four nonepileptic patients. Hippocampal cell loss was found in almost all epileptic patients compared to the control group. Severe cell loss greater than 30% of control values was found in 88.7% of patients without extrahippocampal lesions, but in only 51.8% of patients with dual pathology. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (p less than 0.001). In the dual pathology group, lesions of different pathology had a significant relationship with the degree of hippocampal cell loss: all 12 patients with glioma had mild cell loss, whereas all 13 patients with heterotopia were associated with severe cell loss. Severity of hippocampal cell loss was also analyzed in relation to seizure history: a prior severe head injury was associated with severe cell loss. Other factors such as seizure duration, secondary generalization, or family history of seizures were not associated with hippocampal damage. Dual pathology may produce a combination of neocortical and temporolimbic epilepsies that warrants a precise definition of the true epileptogenic area prior to surgical treatment. 
Regional chemotherapy using continuous intravesical infusion doxorubicin for the treatment of muscle invasive transitional cell bladder carcinoma in a rat model. Previously established animal models of invasive transitional cell bladder carcinoma and continuous infusion intravesical drug delivery were combined to evaluate the urothelial toxicity and antineoplastic efficacy of continuous intravesical infusion doxorubicin (DOX). Dose-response toxicity experiments studied histologic changes in the rat urinary bladder following urothelial exposure to three different urinary levels of DOX, as a function of the duration of drug infusion. Systemic and local drug absorption, as measured by DOX levels in serum, bladder, retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and liver, was measured at intervals during drug administration. In vitro chemosensitivity assays were used to determine tumor sensitivity to DOX. Treatment studies evaluated the impact of 14-day continuous infusion DOX beginning seven days following tumor implantation. No histologically discernable changes in the normal urothelium were noted in bladders of animals receiving continuous intravesicle DOX at mean urinary concentrations of 0.05 micrograms./ml. (n = 5), 0.56 micrograms./ml. (n = 10), and 5.69 micrograms./ml. (n = 10) for periods of up to 14 days. Serum drug concentrations demonstrated a non-significant upward trend following the start of therapy. Significant increases in tissue DOX levels were noted in the bladder and retroperitoneal lymph nodes on chemotherapy days 7 and 14. Mean tissue DOX concentrations in both the bladder and lymph nodes were greater than the IC50 observed in the in vitro sensitivity assay. DOX-treated tumor-bearing animals (n = 17) had a mean tumor volume (+/- standard deviation) of 0.65 gm. +/- 0.52 gm. compared to an average tumor volume of 1.20 gm. +/- 0.66 gm. in the control group (n = 18) (p = 0.0112). Continuous infusion intraluminal chemotherapy demonstrated a clear cytoreductive effect with minimal local toxicity in this model. Drug tissue levels were observed in regional lymphatic drainage fields as well as the bladder wall. Further study to evaluate this approach as a bladder-sparing alternative to muscle invasive disease is warranted. 
Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on pressure-induced left ventricular hypertrophy in rats. The influence of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the development of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy due to stenosis of the aortic arch was studied in female Sprague-Dawley rats. The aortic arch was banded to an outer diameter of 1.0 mm. After 14 days, LV and right ventricular functional parameters and transstenotic pressure gradient were measured in anesthetized rats. In addition, regional heart weights were determined, and myocytes of three different heart regions were isolated and subjected to morphometric analysis. To inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, ramipril was administered orally by gavage in a single daily dose of 1 mg/kg. Rats with aortic stenosis showed a marked increase in LV systolic pressure, mean prestenotic aortic pressure, and LV stroke work compared with sham-operated rats and demonstrated a systolic transstenotic pressure gradient of 82 mm Hg. This increase in LV hemodynamic load was paralleled by the development of LV hypertrophy as determined by a 37% increase in LV weight and by a 20% increase in cell volume of isolated LV myocytes. Concomitant ramipril treatment did not significantly affect LV functional parameters. The transstenotic pressure gradient was the same as in untreated rats with aortic stenosis. Likewise, the weight gain of the LV as well as the development of cellular hypertrophy of the LV were not influenced. Thus, in this model, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition did not reduce the development of LV hypertrophy independent of the hemodynamic load. 
Use of bioerodible polymers impregnated with mitomycin in glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits. A prospective, randomized, double-masked, and placebo-controlled study was performed to evaluate the effects of a localized and sustained release of mitomycin on the success of glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits. A bioerodible polymer was used as the drug carrier. Full-thickness filtration surgeries were performed and data from 22 rabbits were collected. One eye received a polymer impregnated with mitomycin (0.02 mg or 0.06 mg), while the fellow eye received a drug-free polymer. Intraocular pressure, bleb survival, and postoperative complications were investigated. Intraocular pressures remained lower for a longer period of time (P less than 0.004) and filtration blebs lasted longer (P less than 0.05) in experimental eyes than in control eyes. Conjunctivitis and sectorial corneal haze occurred more frequently in eyes treated with the higher dosage mitomycin compared with control eyes. The use of mitomycin-C in a polymer delivery system appeared to promote the success of glaucoma filtration surgery in rabbits. With the lower dosage of mitomycin, clinically significant ocular toxicity was not noted. 
Influence of type of prosthesis on late results after combined mitral-aortic valve replacement. The influence of type of prosthesis on the late outcome of patients with combined mitral-aortic valve replacement was analyzed by comparing, at a 14-year follow-up, patients receiving two biological prostheses (group 1; n = 135), two mechanical prostheses (group 2; n = 221), or a mechanical prosthesis in the aortic position and a bioprosthesis in the mitral position (group 3; n = 97). No difference was found among the three groups in terms of actuarial survival and incidence of and freedom from valve-related deaths, thromboemboli, and hemorrhages. Patients with biological prostheses had a significantly greater incidence of structural valve deterioration, reoperations, and overall complications when compared with patients with only mechanical prostheses. The results of an extended follow-up of patients with combined mitral-aortic valve replacement indicate that mechanical prostheses perform better in the long-term owing to their superior durability when compared with biological valves. The use of bioprostheses should be confined to old patients with limited life expectancy because of their cardiac disease, provided that anticoagulants are not used. Combination of mechanical and biological prostheses in the same patient should be avoided because the advantages of each type of prosthesis are lost. 
Chick nutritional encephalomalacia and prostanoid formation. Nutritional encephalomalacia (NE) was induced in young chicks using a diet low in vitamin E and containing 8% ethyl esters derived from safflower oil fatty acids (S-E group). The same diet with added alpha-tocopheryl acetate (S+E) failed to produce the pathology, and chicks receiving aerated linseed oil--high in alpha-linolenic acid and low in alpha-tocopherol (L-E)--did not develop symptoms. Formation of metabolites from labeled arachidonic acid (AA) by thrombocytes was similar in the S+E and S-E groups, yielding thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and hydroxy fatty acids as the major products. Collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation and TXB2 production were not significantly different in the S-E and S+E groups, but aggregation values and TXB2 synthesis were significantly less in the L-E group than in the ataxic S-E chicks. Prostaglandin E2 production by aortal rings was significantly influenced by the diet; S-E yielded the highest value and L-E the lowest. These results show that alpha-linolenic acid causes alterations in the AA metabolism and thrombocyte function in young chicks. 
Carinal resection for bronchogenic carcinoma. Techniques are available for carinal resection and reconstruction for bronchogenic carcinoma involving the carina. Successful outcome depends on careful patient selection, thorough preoperative evaluation, careful anesthetic management, strict attention to surgical technique, and compulsive postoperative care. Since 1973 we have performed 37 carinal resections for bronchogenic carcinoma: 21 right carinal pneumonectomies, 7 carinal resections, 7 carina plus lobe resections, and 2 carina plus pneumonectomy stump resections. Five patients had diseased N2 nodes and 13 patients had diseased N1 nodes. Complications included pulmonary (8), vocal cord paresis (3), atrial fibrillation (9), anastomotic stenosis (4), and anastomotic separation (3). There were 3 early postoperative deaths (8%). All were related to adult respiratory distress syndrome and were unresponsive to aggressive treatment. There were 4 late postoperative deaths between 2 and 4 months (10.9%). All late postoperative deaths were related to anastomotic complications (stenosis [1] and separation [3]). There are 5 absolute 5-year survivors and an actuarial 5-year survival rate of 19%. 
Endothelial dysfunction in response to psychosocial stress in monkeys. The current study was designed to evaluate the effects of a disrupted social environment on the endothelial integrity of various vascular segments in male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Each of 20 single-caged adult monkeys was fed a diet comparable to a person's ingestion of 240 mg cholesterol/day for a 10-week baseline period and then was introduced as a stranger into a four-member social group for 3 days. Half of the monkeys received a beta-adrenergic blocking agent (metoprolol) via subcutaneous implant 2 days before and during group housing. The social manipulation produced persistent sympathetic arousal as evidenced by significantly elevated heart rates among untreated monkeys (p less than 0.01) but not among their metoprolol-treated counterparts, whose heart rate declined (p less than 0.05). After the social manipulation, all monkeys were necropsied and evaluated for endothelial incorporation of immunoglobulin G (as an indicator of cell death), endothelial cell replication, the presence of adherent leukocytes, and arterial low density lipoprotein permeability and concentration. At branching sites in the thoracic aorta, immunoglobulin G incorporation and endothelial cell replication were significantly greater in untreated monkeys than in metoprolol-treated monkeys (p less than 0.01 for both analyses); no differences existed at nonbranch sites. Endothelial cell replication in the coronary arteries (where immunoglobulin G incorporation was not examined) was also greater among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys. No significant differences were observed between treatment groups in arterial low density lipoprotein permeability or leukocyte adherence; estimates of arterial low density lipoprotein concentrations were higher among untreated than among metoprolol-treated monkeys, but only in the abdominal portion of the aorta. These results indicate that social disruption is associated with both sympathetic nervous system arousal and indexes of endothelial dysfunction, effects that may be prevented by treatment with a beta-adrenergic blocking agent. 
Clinical and electrophysiological aspects of acute paralytic disease of children and young adults in northern China. Acute peripheral nervous system diseases leading to paralysis in children are rare in Europe and the USA, whereas epidemics of a Guillain-Barre-like syndrome occur annually among children in rural parts of northern China. To clarify the features of this disorder 36 patients, aged 15 months to 37 years (median 7) with this syndrome were investigated; 91% were from rural areas. In 47%, a prodromal illness was reported in the preceding 4 weeks. Leg weakness and resistance to neck flexion were the earliest symptoms. The weakness ascended rapidly and symmetrically to affect the arms and respiratory muscles, with maximum weakness occurring a mean of 6 days after onset of weakness. Bulbar weakness occurred in 61% of patients, but only 1 had extraocular paresis. Respiratory assistance was needed by 31% of patients. Tendon reflexes were lost as weakness developed. 42% of patients had raised concentrations of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, and the mean cell count was 3 cells/microliters (range 0-12/microliters). Electrodiagnostic studies in 22 patients showed severe reductions in motor evoked amplitudes from distal stimulation. Sensory action potentials were normal. Electromyography revealed denervation potentials in limb muscles. The distinctive epidemiological, clinical, and neurophysiological characteristics of this illness suggest that the disorder is different from both Guillain-Barre syndrome and poliomyelitis. The neurophysiological findings support the hypothesis that the disorder is a reversible distal motor nerve terminal or anterior horn cell lesion. 
Hemodynamic responses to endotracheal extubation after coronary artery bypass grafting. After coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery, patients may remain at risk for myocardial ischemia and infarction and ventricular dysrhythmias. The hemodynamic responses to endotracheal extubation and the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine pretreatment were studied after CABG surgery and overnight mechanical ventilation. Twenty-five patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 13) patients who had tracheal extubation after pretreatment with a placebo; group 2 patients who received lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) before tracheal extubation. Hemodynamic data, electrocardiographic tracings, and arterial blood gases were obtained before tracheal extubation, during suctioning, and 1, 5, and 20 min after tracheal extubation. Group 1 patients displayed significant increases in heart rate, arterial blood pressure, rate-pressure product, right atrial pressure, and cardiac index during suctioning and within 1 min of tracheal extubation, returning to preextubation level by 5 min. There were no significant changes in pulmonary and systemic resistance indices. Hemodynamic changes in group 2 patients were similar to those in group 1. Both in the absence and presence of lidocaine, tracheal extubation caused hemodynamic responses that were small in magnitude and brief in duration. These responses were not associated with electrocardiographic or enzymatic evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction, or with ventricular dysrhythmias. Compared with the well-documented hemodynamic responses to tracheal intubation, we found that extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery was associated with less pronounced responses. This may be related to avoidance of laryngoscopy and possibly accommodation to the endo-tracheal tube. These modest hemodynamic responses of extubation of the trachea after CABG surgery were not modified by intravenous lidocaine. 
Mycosis fungoides: cutaneous T-cell lymphoma [published erratum appears in Am Fam Physician 1991 Jun;43(6):1954] Most patients with mycosis fungoides are between 40 and 60 years of age. The disease has three clinical stages: (1) the premycotic, or patch, stage, consisting of macular, scaling, faint pink to red pruritic patches, usually on unexposed surfaces; (2) the mycotic, or plaque, stage, consisting of reddish, purple-brown plaques, often annular in shape and symmetric in distribution, and (3) the tumor stage, consisting of red-brown to violaceous, dome-shaped, firm tumors with a predilection for the face and body folds. The Sezary syndrome is a leukemic variant. Treatment depends on the extent of disease and includes topical or systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy and psoralen plus long-wave ultraviolet light therapy. 
Role of extended aortoplasty related to the definition of coarctation of the aorta. One hundred thirty-nine patients underwent operation for coarctation of the aorta. Age ranged from 1 day to 21 years and weight, from 1.5 to 70.4 kg. Numerous methods of repair were used. The operative mortality was low (1.3%), and 17 patients (11.3%) died late. Recoarctation occurred in 13 patients (9.4%). We attempted to correlate mortality and recoarctation with the surgical procedure. A review of the literature revealed no classifications of coarctation that applied to the anatomical and pathological variations we found at the time of operation. Therefore, we devised a surgical classification to separate the various entities in the spectrum of coarctation: type I = primary coarctation; type II = coarctation with isthmus hypoplasia; and type III = coarctation with tubular hypoplasia involving the isthmus and segment between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries. Each of these types has subtypes: A = with ventricular septal defect and B = with other major cardiac defects. We believe that rather than labeling one procedure as "the procedure of choice," providing this classification will allow the surgeon to use a method of repair that is suited to the anatomical variation. 
A follow-up study of occupational skin disease in Western Australia. From a total of 993 previously reported cases of occupational skin disease (OSD), 954 (96%) were contacted and 711 (75%) examined. The review time (i.e., period from original diagnosis of OSD until review) varied from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of over 8 years. Over 60% of cases were reviewed more than 2 years after the original diagnosis was made. More than 50% were still suffering from OSD or consequences related thereto. Clearance was less likely in those who remained in their original, or similar, occupational environment. However, of those who changed their job due to OSD, many suffered aggravation of the dermatitis from factors in the new work environment. Over 10% of cases had evolved into a persistent postoccupational dermatitis without obvious cause. This condition is responsible for considerable impairment and is of medicolegal importance due to confusion as to its relationship to the original occupational factors. 
Balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children. Traditionally, the treatment of esophageal strictures in children has been done with mercury bougies in a prograde fashion or with Tucker dilators passed along a guide wire in a retrograde manner. An alternative approach has used a balloon dilatation catheter passed over a guide wire previously placed under fluoroscopic guidance. Over the past 5 years, this technique has been used in 43 procedures for both discrete and diffuse strictures. The interventions were performed in a total of 15 patients ranging in age from 8 months to 21 years. In all cases, there was improvement of the preceding symptoms following dilatation. This report details the experience with this technique at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, emphasizing the indications, contraindications, and potential complications associated with balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children. 
Remission and recurrence after withdrawal of therapy for ocular cicatricial pemphigoid. Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) is a chronic, progressive, autoimmune disease that scars mucus membranes and may lead to blindness. The authors studied the long-term effects of OCP in 104 consecutive patients (average follow-up, 4 years) to determine whether complete remission could be achieved after a course of treatment with immunosuppressive drugs. Prolonged periods of remission while not undergoing therapy were maintained in approximately one third of patients with OCP. Follow-up must be continued for life, as relapse occurred in 22% of those who were in remission and not undergoing therapy. Those who relapsed regained disease control readily upon reinstitution of therapy and did not deteriorate to more advanced cicatrization. Sex, age, initial degree of inflammation, and the incidence of extraocular involvement did not have a prognostic significance on outcome. Mechanisms that underlie the differing responses to therapy are not yet known. 
Morphometric evidence for bone resorption and replacement in prostate cancer. A series of 78 patients with metastatic bone disease from prostate cancer underwent iliac crest biopsy, enabling histomorphometric quantification of eroded bone surface and bone volume in both tumour-free and metastatic bone tissue. Eroded surfaces in tumour-free specimens were high in patients with active compared to stable disease but bone volume was maintained in both groups, whilst in bone surrounding micrometastases (n = 8) eroded surfaces were further increased and bone volume reduced. Eroded surfaces within metastases were greater still but were associated with increased bone volume due to replacement of the existing trabecular tissue with abnormal woven bone, giving an overall appearance of sclerosis. These results show that the effect of prostate cancer on bone tissue is complex, involving differential disturbance of bone formation and resorption within metastases, in bone surrounding tumour invasion and in the tumour-free skeleton. 
Surface osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma arising on the periosteal aspect of bone comprises a biologically heterogeneous group of neoplasms. The group as a whole may be referred to by a single descriptive term that emphasizes their common site of origin and underscores their malignant osteogenic potential: surface osteosarcoma. Its biologic heterogeneity may be approached via a number of avenues. Detailed description of individual tumors and grading are frequently employed. However, implementation of a classification system based upon reproducible clinical, roentgenographic, macroscopic, and histologic parameters is advantageous. The suggested classification system serves to clearly define parosteal and periosteal osteosarcoma, as well as recognize unusual variants. Most important, it defines therapeutic strategy. The classification system identifies low-grade, biologically indolent forms (i.e., parosteal osteosarcoma and periosteal osteosarcoma) that are best treated by surgery alone. At the same time, it recognizes high-grade forms with significant potential for life-threatening behavior (i.e., 'dedifferentiated' parosteal osteosarcoma and high-grade surface osteosarcoma) that are best managed by multimodality therapy incorporating chemotherapy and surgery. 
Suture entrapment and secondary ureteral obstruction. During the 6-year period ending in 1988, suture entrapment and secondary postoperative ureteral obstruction occurred in 18 (0.33%) of the 5379 patients who underwent major pelvic operations for benign conditions. Sixteen cases occurred after vaginal surgery and two after abdominal hysterectomy. Placement of the McCall suture or sutures for elevation of a bladder neck caused ureteral entrapment most frequently. Early diagnosis was facilitated by comparison of preoperative and postoperative serum creatinine levels. The mean change in serum creatinine level in patients with unilateral obstruction was an increase of 0.8 mg/dl. Treatment by either antegrade placement of ureteral stents or abdominal exploration with deligation or ureteroneocystotomy was successful in all cases. Retrograde placement of ureteral stents was unsuccessful. 
An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 colitis associated with consumption of precooked meat patties. An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis at a Minnesota junior high school in October 1988 comprised 32 cases among 1562 students (attack rate, 2.0%). Four children were hospitalized; none developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Case children were more likely than controls to have eaten heat-processed meat patties (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-20.1; P less than .001) in the school cafeteria on a specific day. The minimum estimated attack rate among students who ate these patties was 8%. The patties should have been sufficiently cooked by the manufacturer to destroy enteric pathogens before they were frozen and distributed. E. coli were cultured from frozen patties that were manufactured at the same plant on the same dates as the implicated patties, but serotype O157:H7 was not isolated. Heat-processed meat patties may serve as vehicles for E. coli O157:H7 infection, and currently there are no federal or state regulatory standards to ensure the safety of these products. 
Dacryocystorhinostomy in osteopetrosis. Osteopetrosis is a rare congenital disorder of bone metabolism characterized by generalized sclerotic bone resulting from osteoclast dysfunction. There are several ocular manifestations, one of which is nasolacrimal duct obstruction from osteosclerosis of the nasolacrimal foramen. The surgeon must anticipate and prepare for the difficulties of working with marbleized, ultra-dense bone, alternating technique accordingly. In nasolacrimal duct obstruction, surgical management produces seemingly stable long-term results. However, if ossification recurs at the operative site, reoperation may become necessary for either optic nerve decompression or dacryocystorhinostomy. 
Timing of breast cancer excision during the menstrual cycle influences duration of disease-free survival OBJECTIVE: To study disease-free survival at 10 years in relation to timing of breast tumor excision during the menstrual cycle. DESIGN: A prospective study of consecutively treated patients with primary breast cancer. SETTING: Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. PATIENTS: Two hundred and eighty-three premenopausal patients treated by mastectomy and axillary dissection. MAIN RESULTS: When the tumor was excised during the follicular phase, approximated by setting the putative day of ovulation on day 14 after the onset of last menses, a higher recurrence risk (43%) was observed compared with excision later in the menstrual cycle (29%, P = 0.02). The rate peaked among patients treated between days 7 and 14 and was lowest between days 20 and 30. Multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model to control for tumor size, nodal status, estrogen receptor status, adjuvant chemotherapy, and family history indicated that the hazard rate of breast cancer recurrence after excision during the follicular phase was 1.53 (95% Cl, 1.02 to 2.29). Stratification by nodal status indicated that the effect of phase was statistically significant only among patients with positive nodes (hazard ratio, 2.10; Cl, 1.19 to 3.70). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that the risk for recurrence may be affected by the hormonal milieu of the menstrual cycle; these findings must be confirmed, however, by a prospective study in which cycle phase at time of tumor excision is biochemically documented. 
Reversible sustained increase of gastrin and gastric acid secretion in a subgroup of duodenal ulcer patients on long-term treatment with H2 antagonists We assessed the effect of long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion on basal and meal-stimulated serum gastrin and gastric acid secretion in 37 patients on long-term maintenance treatment with H2 antagonists for severe relapsing and/or complicated duodenal ulcer disease. After a mean of 142 weeks (range, 28-324 weeks) of continuous treatment, gastric acid secretion, basal plasma gastrin, and gastrin response to a test meal were evaluated. All tests were performed a week after drug discontinuation to exclude rapidly reversible hypergastrinemia. Gastrin levels were above the normal range in seven patients (18.9%). After H2 antagonist were stopped for 6 weeks, basal gastrin returned to normal levels in all cases [from a median of 180 (range, 130-350) pg/ml to 58 (25-90) pg/ml] and peak meal-stimulated gastrin significantly decreased from a median of 500 pg/ml to 245 pg/ml (p = 0.02). In patients with hypergastrinemia, the discontinuation of H2 antagonists for 6 weeks led to a significant decrease of gastric acid secretion. Patients who developed hypergastrinemia spent more weeks on full-dose treatment and had more recurrences during therapy. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that a long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion can induce, in a small percentage of patients, a reversible sustained hypergastrinemia and a consequent increase of acid secretion, which conceivably could lead to more frequent relapses of duodenal ulcer disease. 
Renal plasmacytoma: Mayo Clinic experience and review of the literature. Extramedullary plasmacytoma arising in the kidney is rare. Only 8 cases have been reported. Recently, we noted the ninth case, the second case seen at the Mayo Clinic. Clinically, the tumor mimics a renal cell carcinoma or a transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis. 
The relationship of chemotherapeutic and endocrine intervention on natural killer cell activity in human breast cancer. Peripheral blood natural killer (NK) activity against K562 target tumor cells was monitored in patients with breast cancer receiving no treatment, combination chemotherapy, and/or endocrine therapy. NK activity in untreated Stage I patients with no evidence of disease (ned) was significantly higher than in healthy controls. NK activity was shown to decline in individuals with cytotoxic drug therapy (P equals 0.036). There also were reduction in lymphocyte recoveries concomitant with chemotherapeutic intervention (P less than 0.001). Lymphocyte counts were incorporated in a calculation of absolute NK activity that more accurately reflected the significant reduction in NK activity that occurred in patients with localized and systemic disease on chemotherapy. Different chemotherapeutic agents were found to selectively affect NK activity. Stage II patients on phenylalanine mustard (P)/5-fluorouracil (F) (PF) and cyclophosphamide (C)/methotrexate (M)/5-fluorouracil (F) (CMF) protocols showed significant reductions in overall NK activity relative to healthy controls and Stage I patients with ned. Patients on P/doxorubicin (A)/F/tamoxifen (Tx) (PAFT) protocols showed reduced NK activity relative to Stage I patients. Patients on the short-dose C/A (CA) protocol showed normal levels of overall NK activity. High-risk Stage I patients on methotrexate (M)/F (MF)with sequential leucovorin rescue and patients with metastatic disease on endocrine therapy, i.e., Tx or megestrol acetate (Meg) showed overall NK activities in the range of healthy controls. Patients with systemic disease on CMF, CMF/vincristine/prednisone (CMFVP), vinblastine/A/thiotepa/fluoxymesterone (VATH), mitomycin/mitoxantrone (MtMx), and A regimens showed overall levels of absolute NK that were significantly less than either healthy controls or metastatic patients undergoing endocrine therapy. NK cytolytic data, monitored at multiple effector to target ratios, were subjected to exponential regression analysis. The elevation of NK cell responses in Stage I patients with ned and the decline of NK cell responses with cytotoxic chemotherapy were due to alterations in the maximal plateau levels of NK cell cytotoxicity represented by the A (asymptote) values. The k values obtained on regression analysis and indices of the relative killing capacities of individual NK cells remained unaltered in all populations. These results suggest that the cytolytic lymphocyte NK pool, elevated in Stage I patients with cancer, selectively declines as a result of cytotoxic therapy. 
Examination of the early conceptus. The pathologist encounters the early, first-trimester conceptus as a product of spontaneous or surgical abortion or as a specimen from ectopic, usually tubal, gestation. In the vast majority of cases of spontaneous abortion, the embryo/fetus has been dead for 1 week to several weeks and is most often lost in the process of uterine emptying; the placenta, accordingly, stands as the main "witness" of the abortive process. The fact of embryonic/fetal death is established and dated through an interpretation of gross and microscopic changes in the villous stroma, including its vessels and the embryonic erythrocytes therein. Elective abortions performed for social reasons occasionally yield abnormal findings that suggest gestations otherwise destined to eventual spontaneous abortion. Other therapeutic abortions are indicated by abnormal sonographic or cytogenetic findings that may be correlated with the morphologic features of the evacuated conceptus. Cytogenetic abnormalities correlate to a high degree with embryonic growth disorganization and with early death, usually before the fetal stage (30 mm) is reached. Adequate sampling of the placenta, its membranes, and of the embryo/fetus is recommended. For cytogenetic studies, clean, viable specimens must be obtained; these are most often required in cases of habitual abortion. 
Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty utilizing prolonged balloon inflations: initial results and six-month follow-up. Coronary angioplasty (PTCA) using prolonged balloon inflation has obviated emergency coronary bypass surgery in some patients with acute occlusions at the time of PTCA. However, the use of prolonged balloon inflations has not been shown to improve long-term restenosis rates. As an alternative to the passive autoperfusion catheter, we evaluated a hemoperfusion system in which blood was obtained from the side arm of an arterial sheath and infused through the central lumen of standard balloon catheters via a modified Medrad IV pump during balloon inflation. PTCA was performed in 71 male patients (median age 57 yr). The median balloon inflation time was 4.8 minutes and the median rate of blood perfusion was 30 ml/min. PTCA was successful (lumen increase by 20 percentage points) in 83% of patients (59/71) with diameter stenosis decreasing from a median 82% to 30%. Emergency coronary bypass was required in four patients (5%). Angiographic data for six-month followup was available on 37 patients. The restenosis rate (loss of 50% of gain) was 46% (17/37). The conclusion is that prolonged balloon inflation angioplasty has a role in complicated PTCA but offers no advantage in improving long-term restenosis rates in elective PTCA. 
Epithelial downgrowth following the removal of iris inclusion cysts. We present three patients in whom epithelial downgrowth occurred following the excision of iris inclusion cysts. The sheet-like downgrowth was aggressively treated and successfully eradicated in two of the three patients. Early identification and prompt therapy are essential. 
Estimation of Doppler gradients at rest and during exercise in patients with recoarctation of the aorta. In patients with suspected recoarctation of the aorta the estimation of the pressure difference between the arms and legs is an important part of the examination. Because this difference is often augmented when the circulation is stressed by exercise, exercise tests are a useful part of the evaluation. Doppler echocardiography was used to estimate this pressure difference in 16 adult patients in whom simultaneous pressure and Doppler recordings were made both at rest and during exercise. There was a close correlation between the invasive peak instantaneous gradient and the Doppler gradient both at rest and during exercise. There was only a moderate correlation between the invasive peak to peak gradient and the Doppler gradient at rest and during exercise. Doppler echocardiography is recommended as an easy and accurate method of estimating the peak instantaneous gradient both at rest and during exercise in patients with suspected recoarctation. 
Biological significance of tissue plasminogen activator content in brain tumors. Fresh brain-tumor samples were obtained at operation and analyzed for their content of tissue type plasminogen activator (tPA) using an activity assay (gel chromatography zymogram) and an enzyme-linked immunospecific assay. The specimens were taken from 23 glioblastomas, 35 metastatic tumors, 42 meningiomas, 16 low-grade gliomas, and seven acoustic neurinomas; seven specimens were from normal brain. A strong correlation was found between the results of the two assays (r = 0.77, p less than 0.0001). There was a threefold difference in the tPA content of the benign tumors as compared to malignant tumors (p = 0.0006), the latter having less tPA. Histologically benign meningiomas contained higher tPA than malignant meningiomas (p = 0.01); however, the difference between low-grade gliomas and high-grade gliomas was less evident. Overall regression analysis data have shown an inverse relationship between the tissue content in tPA and the presence and degree of tumor necrosis and peritumoral brain edema (p = 0.004 and p = 0.0004, respectively). This finding was most consistent in the glioblastoma group where the correlation coefficient values were r = 0.53 and r = -0.55, respectively. There was no significant correlation between the tissue tPA content and the age and sex, steroid use, or plasma tPA of the patients or the duration of symptoms. In summary, this is the first demonstration of tPA in a large series of human brain tumors and in normal brain. The differences observed have clear biological significance and, although the source of tPA in tumor tissue is still unknown, a relative reduction in tPA in tumor tissue may play an integral role in the development of tissue necrosis and tissue edema. The lack of tPA in tumor necrosis was not due to tissue destruction and cell death since urokinase was readily detectable in that tissue. 
Autologous transfusion: an alternative to transfusion with banked blood during surgery for cancer. Autologous blood transfusion in surgery for cancer has been avoided because of the metastatic potential of reinfused malignant cells. This study determined whether viable tumour cells remain in the red cell concentrate after separation and whether blood transfusion filters remove these tumour cells before reinfusion. Units of banked blood were inoculated with tumour cell lines: breast cancer SKBr3; colon cancer COLO 320; lymphoma Daudi; erythroleukaemia K562. After processing with the Cell Saver, aliquots of the red cell concentrate and waste saline wash were examined for tumour cells and cultured. Tumour cells from all four cell lines were identified in the red cell concentrate but not in the waste saline wash. All the cell lines except Daudi grew from the red cell concentrate. Experiments on two of the cell lines (SKBr3 and COLO 320) were performed in which the red cell concentrate was either unfiltered (control) or filtered with SQ40S blood transfusion filter or RC100 leucocyte depletion filter. Both cell lines were present in the control samples and after filtration with SQ40S filters, and cells from these samples grew normally in culture. No tumour cells were evident after filtration with the RC100 filters and no growth of either cell line was found after 1 week in culture. The Cell Saver in combination with RC100 filters may be suitable for use during the surgical treatment of malignant disease. 
"Near miss" death in obstructive sleep apnea: a critical care syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to alert critical care physicians to the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea with respiratory failure ("near miss" death) and to elucidate characteristics that might allow earlier recognition and treatment of such patients. DESIGN: We examined clinical and laboratory characteristics of eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea presenting to the ICU with respiratory failure. These characteristics were compared with those of eight stable apnea patients of similar severity but without a history of presentation with respiratory failure. SETTING: Medical ICU and pulmonary outpatient clinic at the Houston Veterans Administration Medical Center, a teaching hospital affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine. PATIENTS: Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea who presented in, or developed, acute respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were matched to eight stable obstructive sleep apnea outpatients from the chest clinic. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The records of these 16 patients were reviewed and multiple characteristics that might predict these obstructive sleep apnea patients prone to respiratory failure and death (called the "near miss" death group; n = 8) were examined. The mean age of the near miss group was 57 yrs. All eight patients presented with respiratory acidosis (mean pH 7.22), hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 82 torr [10.9 kPa]), and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 45 torr [6.0 kPa]). Six of the eight patients had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as determined by clinical characteristics and spirometry. Predisposing factors included facial trauma, lower respiratory tract infections or bronchospasm, and use of pain medication. All but one of the near miss subjects had awake hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 49 torr [6.5 kPa]) and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 58 torr [7.7 kPa]) during periods of clinical stability while only two controls had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and none had hypercarbia. The prevalence of a history of wheezing and prior hospitalization for "respiratory problems" were greater in the near miss group. Once cured of apnea, no patient presented with recurrence of respiratory failure in follow-up ranging from 6 to 80 months, and cor pulmonale recurred in only one patient during subsequent onset of central apneas. CONCLUSION: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea who have concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hypercarbia and hypoxemia are more prone to develop severe respiratory failure and probable death than those patients with apnea alone. The current study shows that recurrent respiratory failure and presumably mortality from this acute complication can be reversed with effective treatment of the obstructive apnea. 
Symptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle. A case of symptomatic diverticulum of the 4th ventricle in a 57-year-old man is presented. This clinicopathological observation supports a relationship between ventricular diverticula and ependyma-lined paraventricular cysts. 
Morphologic and staining characteristics of a cyanobacterium-like organism associated with diarrhea. A spherical organism 9-10 microns in diameter, seen in three outbreaks of diarrhea in Southeast Asia and the United States during the past 2 years, bore characteristics of a cyanobacterium when observed in formalin-preserved stool specimens and by electron microscopy. Organisms in freshly passed stool specimens showed an internal morula of lipid-containing globules. In fresh water, the morula divided into two sausage-shaped structures resembling the sporocysts of an isosporid coccidian. After 7 months, the organisms had not developed the crescentic sporozoites seen in the Coccidia but had begun to multiply slowly in culture. It was impossible to stain the internal structures of the organisms because the outer cyst wall ruptured during desiccation, releasing the contents of the cysts. The organisms were readily identified by their intense blue autofluorescence under UV light, but they were also recognizable by bright-field microscopy and by a modified acid-fast stain. Almost all infected persons suffered intermittent diarrhea for 2-3 weeks and many emphasized a feeling of intense fatigue during the course of their illness. 
The initial electrocardiogram in patients seen by a mobile coronary care unit. The advent of thrombolytic therapy for patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction has highlighted the importance of the initial electrocardiogram (ECG) in decision making. Thus we analysed the initial ECGs of 94 consecutive cases with suspected myocardial infarction who were seen within six hours after the onset of chest pain by a mobile coronary care unit. The study included 91 patients (three patients admitted twice) (61 male), aged 27-83 years (mean 60.5). Median time from onset of chest pain to arrival of the mobile coronary care unit was 75 minutes (range 15-345), and mean mobile coronary care unit response time was 12.3 +/- 7 (SD) minutes (range 5-45). The majority of cases (65 of 94, 69.1 per cent) were seen within two hours of the onset of symptoms. A final diagnosis of myocardial infarction was made in 48 of 94 (51.1 per cent) cases; 38 had unstable angina and eight other diagnoses. Of the 48 with myocardial infarction the initial ECG showed ST segment elevation in 37, ST depression and or T wave inversion in six, Q waves only in three and left bundle branch block in two. No patient with an initially normal ECG had a myocardial infarction. Thrombolytic therapy was given out of hospital to 33 of 38 patients with ST segment elevation. In seven patients with ST elevation (median delay time to intensive care 60 minutes), rapid resolution of ST segment elevation occurred following thrombolytic therapy and there was no significant elevation of cardiac enzymes, suggesting that the infarct had been aborted. 
Fluoroscopically guided nasoenteric feeding tube placement: results of a 1-year study. Nasoenteric tube feeding is a widely used alternative to parenteral intravenous nutritional support or gastrostomy tube placement. Unmonitored tube passage may result in complications and delays the beginning of tube feedings. The authors studied the results of 882 fluoroscopically guided feeding tube placements in 448 patients in 1 year to determine rates of success and complications, as well as the long-term outcome of this population of patients. Seven hundred sixty-four attempts (86.6%) were successful in positioning the tube distal to the third portion of the duodenum. Four major complications (three fatal arrhythmias and one tracheobronchial injury) were encountered. Only seven patients (2%) experienced aspiration events that were due to positioning of the tube in the distal duodenum. Seventy-seven percent of patients required either one or two tubes; the average "tube life" was 7.8 days. Most repositionings were required because of patient noncompliance or inappropriate administration of solid medications. Fluoroscopically guided nasoenteric tube passage is safe, easily performed, and highly successful, and has resulted in widespread clinical acceptance in our institution. 
Blood flow reactivity to hypercapnia in strictly unilateral carotid disease: preliminary results. To show relationship between degree of carotid arterial stenosis and cerebral blood flow reactivity (RES%) to induced hypercapnia, fluorine-18-fluoromethane and positron emission tomography (PET) was used to study 18 patients with carotid distribution transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), all free of stroke, who had angiographic-proven unilateral arterial disease. Non-involved carotid arteries were either normal or had non-stenotic plaque. Either normal arteries or nonstenotic ulcerations in the symptomatic carotid arteries were present in five of 18 (28%), ipsilateral carotid stenosis from 50-99% was present in eight of 18 (44%), and ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion was present in five of 18 (28%) patients. In comparison with 14 normal controls, all patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow territories had significantly lower mean (SEM) RES% [5.0' (0.2) vs 4.0 (0.9), p less than 0.04]. Symptomatic anterior borderzone (ABZ) RES% was also significantly lower [4.6 (0.4) vs 3.3 (0.9), p less than 0.04], than controls. In patient subgroup comparisons, the 50-99% stenosis subgroup clearly had the lowest MCA RES% [3.4 (0.2)] as well as the lowest ABZ RES% [2.8 (0.4)] on their symptomatic sides. Age, expired pCO2, mean arterial blood pressure, serum glucose, serum haematocrit and number, type and estimated duration of TIAs were not significantly different between subgroups. Linear regression showed a significant relationship between RES% and both measured percentage-stenosis (p = 0.04) and residual luminal diameter (p = 0.05) in symptomatic MCA territories. This approached significance in symptomatic ABZ regions. This preliminary data set suggests that unilateral carotid stenosis can and does result in impaired CO2 reactivity following hypercapnia. 
Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in two patients with basilar artery occlusion. Two patients with angiographically proved basilar artery occlusion were treated with systemic recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) according to protocol. The first patient was in a locked-in state and gradually deteriorated. On repeat angiography the basilar artery remained occluded. He died and necropsy revealed a pontine haemorrhagic infarction. The second patient, who was comatose and with decerebrate posturing, made a remarkable recovery. Angiography showed reperfusion. Therapy was initiated in the first patient after six hours and in the second after two hours. Treatment with rtPA is promising but probably not feasible for every patient. Success may depend on duration of occlusion and composition of occluding thrombus. 
Acalculous biliary pain: cholecystectomy alleviates symptoms in patients with abnormal cholescintigraphy. A 45-minute infusion of an octapeptide of cholecystokinin (Kinevac; Squibb Diagnostics, New Brunswick, NJ) was used to measure the gallbladder ejection fraction during cholescintigraphy in 40 normal volunteers. Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy was shown to be a reproducible test. The maximum mean gallbladder ejection fraction occurred 15 minutes after cholecystokinin infusion and was 74.5% +/- 1.9% (mean +/- SEM). A gallbladder ejection fraction greater than 40% (mean -3SD) was arbitrarily defined to be normal. The gallbladder ejection fraction test was then used to identify patients with acalculous biliary symptoms who may respond to cholecystectomy. A total of 103 patients was tested; 21 had abnormal gallbladder ejection fractions and were randomized into two groups, cholecystectomy or no operation. These patients were followed up symptomatically at 3-month intervals for 13-54 months (mean, 34 months). Of the 11 patients who underwent cholecystectomy, 10 (91%) lost their symptoms and 1 improved. Of the 10 patients in the group that did not undergo surgery, all continued to be symptomatic, 2 of whom requested cholecystectomy after 13 and 24 months, respectively. Of the 13 gallbladders obtained from surgery, 12 showed evidence of chronic cholecystitis, muscle hypertrophy, and/or narrowed cystic duct. A normal gallbladder ejection fraction was recorded in 82 patients, and further treatment was left to the discretion of their referring clinician. On follow-up, 50 patients were asymptomatic and 10 were symptomatic without specific treatment of the biliary tract; 14 underwent cholecystectomy, 8 of whom were asymptomatic. Pathological abnormalities were recorded in 6 of the removed gallbladders. It is concluded that the gallbladder ejection fraction obtained after a 45-minute infusion of cholecystokinin during cholescintigraphy is a reproducible measure of gallbladder emptying, and that cholecystectomy alleviates the biliary-type pain of patients with a reduced gallbladder ejection fraction. 
Automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator: is early implantation cost-effective? The evaluation of survivors of sudden cardiac death with serial electrophysiologic studies involves a lengthy and expensive hospitalization, especially when an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator is ultimately necessary. The cost efficacy of this conventional approach was therefore compared with direct implantation of a cardioverter-defibrillator after the first electrophysiologic study. Thirty-two survivors of sudden death who had inducible ventricular tachycardia during their initial electrophysiologic study underwent serial drug trials. At discharge 12 (37%) were taking an antiarrhythmic drug found to prevent induction of ventricular tachycardia and 20 underwent cardioverter-defibrillator implantation after serial drug trials proved ineffective. The average length of hospitalization for this group that had undergone serial drug testing was 20.2 +/- 9.3 days at an average cost of $48,900 +/- $31,600. Seven survivors of sudden death had no inducible ventricular tachycardia during their initial electrophysiologic study and underwent direct cardioverter-defibrillator implantation. Their average length of hospitalization was 12.6 +/- 6.2 days at an average cost of $40,400 +/- $8,300. It is concluded that automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation as an early intervention is not more costly and indeed may be cost-effective compared with therapy guided by serial electrophysiologic testing. As antitachycardia devices become more versatile, long lived and easier to implant, earlier implantation is likely to compare even more favorably with drug therapy. 
Increased dietary branched-chain amino acids do not improve growth in developing rats with chronic biliary obstruction. We studied dietary branched-chain amino acid enrichment in cholestatic weanling rats. Growth was assessed with body weight, muscle weight and nitrogen balance. Systemic metabolic measurements that reflect liver function were evaluated, including plasma ammonia, albumin, amino acids, glucose, triglyceride and branched-chain ketoacids, as well as urinary carnitine excretion. Twenty-two rats underwent bile-duct ligation at 14 d of age. At weaning, 11 rats were fed a control diet and 11 an isoenergetic, isonitrogenous branched-chain amino acid-enriched diet for 3 wk, each with a sham-operated, pair-fed control. Body weights were similar in all four groups. Changes due to bile-duct ligation and not affected by the diet manipulation included lower plasma glucose, nitrogen balance and muscle weight, and higher triglyceride concentration, carnitine excretion and liver weight. Changes due to ligation that were normalized by dietary manipulation included plasma albumin, ammonia and total amino acid concentrations. The ratio of branched-chain to aromatic amino acids was decreased in ligated animals fed both diets; however, branched-chain amino acids were lower in the two groups fed more branched-chain amino acids. 
Disturbance in sodium regulating hormones in chronic obstructive uropathy. Serum atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), plasma renin activity (PRA), angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone levels have been studied in patients with chronic bilateral ureteric obstruction resulting from high pressure chronic retention of urine (HPCR), both in the obstructed state and during the post-obstructed period. Increased ANP levels observed during chronic obstruction fell rapidly following urinary tract decompression by urethral catheterisation. Serum ANP resurged briefly within 24 h but stabilised thereafter at a lower level. PRA was initially suppressed but rose after catheterisation, the increase lagging behind the changes seen for ANP. Rising levels of AII and aldosterone followed this trend but, unlike PRA, levels were not completely suppressed in the obstructed state. The observed hormonal changes probably reflect homeostatic mechanisms directed to the maintenance of sodium and water balance during obstruction and to limitation of the diuresis following its relief. 
Repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms. A statewide experience. The results of elective treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms are excellent in many institutions. To our knowledge, however, no study has compared the results in a large geographic area in which patients were treated by a variety of surgeons and hospitals. We studied the results of repairing abdominal aortic aneurysms for all Medicare recipients during a single year in Kentucky. One hundred thirty-six operations were performed by 52 surgeons in 31 hospitals. Overall operative mortality was 18%; elective and emergency operative mortality rates were 6% and 49%, respectively. Advancing age did not affect outcome, but mortality due to ruptured aneurysms was higher in smaller hospitals than in larger hospitals. The low mortality for elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms in an elderly population by numerous surgeons in divergent hospitals is a strong indication for its liberal use compared with the high mortality and morbidity of emergency surgery. 
Empowering potential: a theory of wellness motivation. Data were collected from 29 individuals who were attempting to initiate and sustain programs of cardiac risk factor modification. Data were analyzed through the technique of constant comparative analysis. Empowering potential, the basic social process identified from the data, explained individual motivation to initiate and sustain cardiovascular health behavior. Empowering potential was a continuous process of individual growth and development which facilitated the emergence of new and positive health patterns. Within the process of empowering potential, individuals use a variety of strategies which guide the initiation and maintenance of health-related change. The process of empowering potential consists of three stages: appraising readiness, changing, and integrating change. Two categories occurred throughout the process of empowering potential: imaging and social support systems. These findings provide a better understanding of how motivated action is initiated and reinitiated over time. 
Effects of urokinase receptor occupancy on plasmin generation and proteolysis of basement membrane by human tumor cells. The goal of the present study was to assess the relative importance of receptor-bound and secreted plasminogen activator urokinase (u-PA) in generating cell-surface plasmin and fostering destruction of normal tissue by tumor cells. We first showed that active site-inhibited u-PA could displace endogenous u-PA from the surface of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line HCT 116. We then prepared expression vectors for u-PA and for a mutant molecule in which the codon for the active site serine residue was changed to encode alanine. Expression of non-functional mutant u-PA decreased the level of cell-bound active u-PA by more than 95% via a mechanism that involved competition for receptor sites. Decreased cell-surface u-PA activity was associated with a decrease in cell-bound plasmin activity to undetectable levels, suggesting that receptor-bound u-PA plays an important role in the generation of plasmin on the cell surface. Transfectants that secreted eightfold to 20-fold elevated levels of active wild-type u-PA showed approximately 50% increases in cell-associated u-PA and only twofold to fourfold increases in cell-associated plasmin, suggesting that the role of secreted u-PA in generating cell-surface plasmin activity was relatively minor. In parent cells and both types of transfectants there was a good correlation between the amount of plasmin bound to the tumor cell surface and the extent to which a basement membrane substrate was degraded. These studies show that receptor-bound u-PA provides an efficient mechanism for plasmin generation on the surface of tumor cells, which, in turn, contributes significantly to their degradative potential. 
Impaired binding properties of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease. To determine the factors underlying the apparent reduction in binding ability of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma, hormone-binding characteristics were further examined in patients with this disease and in control subjects. No differences in affinity constants with respect to triodothyronine or serum thyroxine-binding globulin from hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhotic and normal subjects were found. The affinity for thyroxine was significantly reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.41 +/- 0.13 x 10(10) mol-1) and cirrhotic (0.65 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) mol-1) patients compared with normal subjects (0.94 +/- 0.7 x 10(10) mol-1). Investigations carried out on liver tissue obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease showed that thyroxine-binding globulin within tumor tissue was elevated and bound less exogenous tracer hormone compared with that obtained from nontumor tissue. Tumor-derived thyroxine-binding globulin with altered binding properties is, at least partly, responsible for the abnormal behavior of the serum protein in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Isradipine twice daily lowers blood pressure over 24 H. The objective of this study was to compare the effects of isradipine and placebo on blood pressure (BP) at the end of the dosing interval ('trough'). Following a three-week placebo period, 187 patients who had previously shown a response to treatment with isradipine (based on office BP measurements) were randomized to double-blind treatment with 2.5 mg isradipine twice daily or placebo for six weeks. Four of these patients withdrew from the study during the double-blind phase because of adverse events (one taking isradipine and three taking placebo). Blood pressure during the double-blind study was always measured 12 h after drug administration (trough values). The rate of normalization [defined as diastolic BP (DBP) less than or equal to 90 mm Hg] was 52/96 (54%) in the isradipine-treated group compared with 30/87 (33%) in the placebo group. A further 12/96 (12%) patients taking isradipine showed a fall in DBP of greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg, although their DBP was still not less than 90 mm Hg, compared with 5/87 (6%) patients receiving placebo. This difference was statistically significant (P = .003). Thus, isradipine in a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily lowers blood pressure over 24 h. 
Chimeric BCR-abl messenger RNA as a marker for minimal residual disease in patients transplanted for Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We correlated polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-detectable BCR-abl fusion transcripts with cytogenetic status in 24 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). Of 10 Philadelphia chromosome negative (Ph-) patients, only one was found to exhibit a BCR-abl fusion transcript. Fourteen patients with Ph+ ALL, including eight in clinical remission, exhibited PCR-detectable BCR-abl rearrangements. A detectable Ph chromosome was present in only five of the eight patients in clinical remission. Of the three cytogenetically negative, BCR-abl-positive patients, two eventually succumbed to post-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) relapse. The third died of early transplant complications. Serial PCR analyses were performed on four Ph+ ALL patients in clinical remission who underwent allogeneic BMT. One patient who was PCR negative on post-BMT days 21 and 75 became PCR-positive on day 116 and died in relapse on day 154. One patient was weakly positive for BCR-abl on day 23, negative on day 56, but died of transplant complications on day 124. Two patients exhibited no post-BMT BCR-abl rearrangements and remain well on days 279 and 371. Our findings suggest that PCR analysis may be useful in the early identification of relapse in patients transplanted for Ph+ ALL. 
The "make/break test" as a diagnostic tool in functional weakness. Strength was measured in four major muscle groups with a hand-held dynamometer. The "make" and "break" technique was used with and without encouragement, and fatiguability was tested in patients with organic weakness and patients with functional weakness. Patients with functional weakness could be distinguished from the other two groups by an increase in strength greater than 20% with the break compared with the make technique. Additionally they tend to show larger increases in strength with encouragement and their "fatiguability" was less. 
Localized recurrent postoperative pernio associated with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A patient with recurrent pernio of the right ankle for 21 years after surgery had a leukocytoclastic vasculitis localized in the area. We suggest that the various histologic descriptions of pernio in the literature and in this case represent different levels of severity of the disease. 
Early hepatocellular carcinoma: MR imaging. All areas in hepatic lesions designated as adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) with malignant foci have recently been recognized as cancer. AH with malignant foci can be classified into two types, depending on the presence of overt cancerous nodules. Lesions without macroscopic nodules are defined as early hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), while those with a macroscopic component are defined as HCC with early components. A comparative study of early HCC and HCC with early components was performed with magnetic resonance imaging. Early HCC lesions (n = 20) were isointense (n = 11) and hyperintense (n = 9) on T1-weighted spin-echo images and isointense (n = 17), partially hyperintense (n = 2), or hypointense (n = 1) on T2-weighted spin-echo images relative to the surrounding liver. Lesions classified as HCC with early components (n = 8) were hyperintense (n = 5), isointense (n = 2), and of mixed signal intensity (n = 1) on T2-weighted images. T1-weighted imaging was superior to T2-weighted imaging in depicting early HCC, but the latter could be useful in evaluating the progression of HCC in the histopathologically early stages. 
Heart disease in blacks of Africa and the Caribbean. Cardiovascular pathology in African and Afro-Caribbean blacks features three major conditions: hypertension, rheumatic heart disease, and the cardiomyopathies. Ischemic heart disease is as yet distinctly uncommon in these societies but the adoption of Western lifestyle and its inevitable risk factors for atherosclerosis makes it likely that coronary artery disease will emerge ultimately. Hypertension poses special problems in these regions--its prevalence rate is high both in rural and urban settings, its consequences devastating in its severity of target organ involvement, and its management strategy complicated by the high cost of drugs, poor patient compliance, and the lack of clinical resources for effective monitoring of detected and referred cases. Rheumatic heart disease remains an eminently preventable condition. The ultimate strategy lies in improving the quality of life in these communities through adequate housing, sanitation, and health education, and integrating primary prophylaxis into national health care programs to forestall the development of rheumatic fever. Cardiomyopathy poses the greatest challenge as its etiology remains elusive. Its dilated form has been linked with Toxoplasma and with Coxsackie B viruses, but hard evidence of a cause-effect relationship is still lacking. 
Breast conservation therapy. Severe breast fibrosis after radiation therapy in patients with collagen vascular disease. Two patients with collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma) had extremely poor cosmetic results after breast radiation therapy (RT). The patient with rheumatoid arthritis received 5251 cGy at 210 cGy per day, followed by a 1600 cGy iridium-192 implant boost. Between 8 and 11 months post-RT she had severe breast fibrosis, retraction, and pain that required a mastectomy for relief. The patient with scleroderma received 5040 cGy at 180 cGy per day without a boost. Between 1 and 4 months post-RT the systemic symptoms of scleroderma progressed and the breast became hard and retracted. Both rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are chronic systemic diseases characterized by severe inflammation and an autoimmune component. The presence of scleroderma at or before treatment should be considered a contraindication to breast RT, whereas the presence of active rheumatoid arthritis should be considered a relative contraindication. An autoimmune mechanism will be presented to explain both the fibrosis and the systemic progression of collagen vascular disease that was observed. 
Outcome after emergency surgery for cancer of the large intestine. The data for 77 patients with colorectal cancer who underwent emergency surgery for acute intestinal obstruction (57 patients) or perforation (20 patients) within 24 h of admission were evaluated. The patients were older and had more advanced disease than patients undergoing elective surgery for colorectal cancer. Emergency surgery for carcinoma of the right colon consisted of primary resection in 95 per cent of cases and was followed by a 28 per cent mortality rate. Perforated tumours of the left colon and rectum were managed by primary resection in 82 per cent of cases with a 22 per cent mortality rate. In contrast, obstructing tumours of the left colon and rectum were treated by primary resection in 38 per cent of cases with a 6 per cent mortality rate, and by primary decompression in 62 per cent of cases with a 25 per cent mortality rate. The overall postoperative mortality rate was 23 per cent and increased with advanced tumour disease, perforation and peritonitis. Cardiac decompensation and intraabdominal sepsis were the major causes of death. Although the long-term survival rate following emergency surgery was worse than after elective surgery, improvements in outcome should be achieved by better management of the initial emergency situation. 
Serial gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans in patients with early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: implications for clinical trials and natural history. Six patients with early, mild, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis were studied with monthly gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans for 8 to 11 months. Numerous enhancing lesions were observed irrespective of clinical activity. Four of the 6 patients had one or more enhancing lesions present on each examination. The other 2 patients had enhancing lesions noted in 7 and 9 of 11 months. In contrast, only two clinical exacerbations were observed during the study period. Neither the exacerbations nor other changes in symptoms or signs correlated with occurrence of the enhancing lesions. Enhancement generally persisted for less than 1 month. The opening of the blood-brain barrier as reflected by gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging may represent ongoing disease activity in patients with mild, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis who are clinically stable. The frequency of these lesions appears to be sufficient to use as an outcome measure in clinical trials testing clinical efficacy in patients with early, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. 
Diagnostic sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot hybridization for the detection of human papillomavirus DNA in biopsy specimens from cervical lesions. Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with benign and malignant neoplasms of the cervix. One of the criteria for their etiologic role requires an assessment of whether virtually all or only a small fraction of lesions contain viral genomes. DNA preparations from colposcopically directed punch biopsies of cervical lesions were analyzed by Southern blot hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of HPV DNA. The biopsy specimens represented different pathologic entities (koilocytosis, condyloma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and invasive carcinoma). In Southern blot hybridization with radioactive probes for HPV 11, 16, 18, 31, and 33, HPV DNA was detected in 74% of the biopsy specimens (42 of 57 cases), with the predominant types being HPV 16 and HPV 18. In contrast, after PCR amplification with primers yielding fragments of characteristic size for HPV 11, 16, and 18, the analysis of the same 57 biopsy specimens revealed that all samples were positive for at least one HPV type. To exclude false-positive PCR results, controls without HPV DNA were interspersed at regular intervals, and results were evaluated only if these controls remained HPV negative. To exclude false-negative results due to failure of the reaction, a target sequence within the c-Ha-ras-1 gene was used as an internal control. All HPV typing results obtained by Southern blot hybridization were in agreement with HPV typing by PCR. The higher number of positive samples in the latter analysis stems from the increased sensitivity of PCR, which was which was effective in identifying as few as 10-100 HPV DNA molecules; in contrast, the sensitivity of Southern blot hybridization was 1 pg, or approximately 10(5) molecules of HPV DNA. The authors conclude that, with sufficiently sensitive diagnostic methods, HPV DNA can be detected in most, if not all, neoplastic cervical lesions. 
bcl-1 rearrangement. Frequency and clinical significance among B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. The authors investigated the structural organization of the bcl-1 locus, a putative oncogene associated with reciprocal chromosomal translocation t(11;14), by Southern blot hybridization analysis and its frequency, distribution, and prognostic significance in a panel of 156 clinically and pathologically well-defined B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs) and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). The authors detected bcl-1 rearrangements in only 2 of 42 CLLs and 4 of 114 NHLs, specifically 3 of 29 diffuse small lymphocytic and 1 of 10 diffuse small cleaved cell and none of 5 diffuse intermediate lymphocytic, 13 follicular predominantly small cleaved, 17 follicular mixed small cleaved and large cell, 4 diffuse mixed small and large cell, 26 diffuse large cell, and 10 diffuse small noncleaved cell lymphomas. None of seven cases of Rai stage III or IV CLL or seven diffuse large cell lymphomas occurring as Richter's syndrome exhibited bcl-1 rearrangements. In conclusion, the bcl-1 locus rearranges in only about 4% of B-cell CLLs and NHLs, is predominantly rearranged in low-grade B-cell neoplasms, and does not appear to be preferentially associated with those occasional CLLs and low-grade NHLs displaying clinical aggressiveness, advanced clinical stage, or large cell transformation (Richter's syndrome). Therefore the demonstration of bcl-1 rearrangement does not appear to have clinically useful prognostic significance. 
Modifications of the nasal cycle in patients with hypothalamic disorders: Kallmann's syndrome. The nasal cycle is a phenomenon characterized by cyclic changes in the airflow resistance of each nasal fossa from congestion or constriction of the nasal erectile tissue. This phenomenon is caused by alterations in the influence exerted by the autonomic nervous system and is believed to be regulated by a hypothalamic center. In order to verify this hypothesis on the hypothalamic regulation of the nasal cycle, the authors studied a group of subjects with Kallmann's syndrome. This disorder is characterized by coexisting hypothalamic hypogonadism and hyposmia or anosmia due to hypothalamic and olfactory center hypoplasia. An anomalous nasal cycle was found in all the subjects with Kallmann's syndrome. This disorder might be related to hypothalamus atrophy. 
Abdominal musculature abnormalities as a cause of groin pain in athletes. Inguinal hernias and pubalgia. There has been increasing interest within the European sports medicine community regarding the etiology and treatment of groin pain in the athlete. Groin pain is most commonly caused by musculotendinous strains of the adductors and other muscles crossing the hip joint, but may also be related to abdominal wall abnormalities. Cases may be termed "pubalgia" if physical examination does not reveal inguinal hernia and there is an absence of other etiology for groin pain. We present nine cases of patients who underwent herniorrhaphies for groin pain. Two patients had groin pain without evidence of a hernia preoperatively (pubalgia). In the remaining seven patients we determined the presence of a hernia by physical examination. At operation, eight patients were found to have inguinal hernias. One patient had no hernia but had partial avulsion of the internal oblique fibers from their insertion at the public tubercle. The average interval from operation to return to full activity was 11 weeks. All patients returned to full activity within 3 months of surgery. One patient had persistent symptoms of mild incisional tenderness, but otherwise there were no recurrences, complications, or persistence of symptoms. Abnormalities of the abdominal wall, including inguinal hernias and microscopic tears or avulsions of the internal oblique muscle, can be an overlooked source of groin pain in the athlete. Operative treatment of this condition with herniorrhaphy can return the athlete to his sport within 3 months. 
The influence of smoking on complications after primary amputations of the lower extremity. A total of 165 primary above-the-knee (AK) and below-the-knee (BK) amputations in 137 patients were reviewed retrospectively. Of the 77 patients who smoked, 44 smoked cigarettes, 30 cheroots, and three a pipe. There were 88 nonsmokers. At the time of surgery, the smokers were on average 6.4 years younger than the nonsmokers. The review revealed no discrepancy between smokers and nonsmokers with regard to amputation level, the BK to AK ratio being 2:1. In cigarette smokers the risk of infection and reamputation was 2:5 times higher than in cheroot smokers or nonsmokers. The poor results obtained in cigarette smokers may be ascribed to the fact that this group of patients smoked during the phase of healing and that only cigarette smokers tend to inhale. Inhalation of smoke leads to high concentrations of nicotine, which compromise the cutaneous blood-flow velocity and increase the risk of the formation of microthrombi. Consequently, amputees should abstain from cigarette smoking during the phase of healing. Preferably, the habit should be broken one week before surgery, which is the requisite period for the process of coagulation and the fibrinogen level to normalize and for free radicals to be eliminated. 
Surgical management of metastatic renal carcinoma of the spine. A total of 33 patients with renal cell carcinoma metastatic to the spine underwent spinal decompression over a 5-year period; 20 were operated on for neurologic dysfunction, and the remainder for pain alone. Surgery was performed anteriorly in 21, posteriorly in 9, and combined in 3 cases. The surgical approach was determined by the preoperative anatomic localization of the tumor. Of these patients 88% had fusions with instrumentation and polymethylmethacrylate; 88% of patients had partial or complete relief of pain; and 64% of bedridden patients subsequently were able to walk. Neurologic function improved in 60% of patients with a neurologic deficit; however, only 36% of incontinent patients regained bladder control. Survival averaged 8.0 +/- 1.5 months. Survival correlated with the degree of neurologic dysfunction and the presence of other known metastases. Recurrent cord compression developed in 49% of patients, usually at the same level; 9 of these 16 patients had repeat decompression, with similar operative results as the primary procedure in terms of pain and neurologic function. Blood loss was variable but often significant. Preoperative embolization appeared to be beneficial. Precise tumor localization preoperatively directing the surgical approach and better patient selection would likely improve results and decrease morbidity. Good palliation appeared to be achieved in regards to both pain relief and improved neurologic function. 
Identification of colon cancer-predisposed individuals: a cytogenetic analysis. Peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 23 individuals with polyps and 10 age-matched controls were cytogenetically studied. Of 23 individuals with polyps, 13 were males and 10 females. The age distribution of these patients was between 22 and 84 yr, with a medium age of 49.6 yr. Chromosome 5 was involved in structural rearrangements in 10 of the 18 patients with adenomatous polyps (55.5%). All those who showed involvement of chromosome 5 alterations had either adenomatous polyps or Gardner's syndrome, and two had colon adenocarcinoma. Of the remainder who did not show involvement of chromosome 5, eight had adenomatous polyps and five had hyerplastic polyps (non-neoplastic). Of the 10 control samples, only one showed alteration of chromosome 5. Of the 10 adenomatous polyp subjects that showed chromosome 5 defects, two had translocations of chromosome 5 and the short arm of 17. Chromosome 5 was broken 13 times (5 times in the q arm and 8 times in the p arm). Based on our present cytogenetic data, we tentatively conclude that lymphocyte metaphases may be used to identify colon cancer-predisposed individuals. 
Attenuation of myocardial ischemia during coronary occlusion by ultrashort-acting beta adrenergic blockade. To assess the effect of the ultrashort-acting beta blocker esmolol on ischemia induced by acute coronary occlusion, we studied 16 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty. Doppler echocardiography and ECG monitoring were performed continuously before, during, and after balloon occlusion in the drug-free state and during esmolol infusion. Fourteen of the 16 patients had ST segment elevation during balloon inflation. However, maximal ST segment elevation (2.1 +/- 1.5 mm vs 1.7 +/- 1.3 mm, p less than 0.001) and duration of ST segment elevation (68 +/- 20 seconds vs 54 +/- 19 seconds, p less than 0.05) were both significantly reduced during esmolol infusion. Furthermore, the decrease in ejection fraction seen during drug-free balloon occlusions was significantly blunted during esmolol infusion. In the baseline state ejection fraction decreased from 55% to 38% (p less than 0.05) during coronary occlusion compared with a decrease from 52% to 49% (p = NS) during esmolol infusion. In addition, esmolol appeared to delay the onset of segmental wall motion abnormalities after coronary occlusion, occurring at a mean of 40 seconds after balloon inflation versus a mean of 31 seconds in the absence of beta blockade (p less than 0.05). Thus the use of ultrashort-acting beta blockade appears to diminish the extent and delay the onset of myocardial ischemia during acute coronary occlusion. 
Uterine leiomyoma with skeletal muscle differentiation. Report of a case. Skeletal muscle differentiation is reported in a uterine leiomyoma from a 54-year-old woman. Evidence of rhabdomyoblastic features included a typical light microscopic appearance, immunoreactivity with antimyoglobin antibodies by immunoperoxidase studies, and the presence of myofibrils by electron microscopic examination. The patient is well more than two years after surgery. 
Treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy with intravenous etidronate. A controlled, multicenter study. The Hypercalcemia Study Group In a prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter study, 202 patients with cancer from 19 medical centers were treated for hypercalcemia of malignancy with daily intravenous infusions of etidronate disodium (136 patients) or saline alone (66 patients) for 3 consecutive days. Patients also received up to 3.25 L of saline daily during the treatment period. Of 157 patients for whom data could be evaluated for efficacy, 63% (72/114) of etidronate-treated and 33% (14/43) of saline-treated patients had a normalization of total serum calcium levels. When serum calcium levels were adjusted for albumin (147 assessable patients), 24% of the etidronate- and 7% of the saline-treated patients responded to treatment. No serious side effects or treatment-related deaths occurred. When accompanied by adequate hydration and diuresis, intravenous etidronate was safe and more effective than hydration and diuresis alone in controlling hypercalcemia of malignancy. 
The efficacy of fiberoptic endoscopic examination and biopsy in the detection of early nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Fiberoptic endoscopic examination and biopsy of the nasopharynx was done in 130 patients as a prospective study. They all had elevated titers of antibodies against the viral capsid antigen of Epstein-Barr virus but no symptoms or signs of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Each underwent a biopsy from six fixed sites in the nasopharynx. Of the 780 biopsy specimens taken from seven patients, 11 showed the presence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Techniques to improve the yields of such biopsies with fiberoptic endoscopy are discussed. The presence of tumor was unrelated to the macroscopic endoscopic findings. The highest incidence of subclinical tumor is in the pharyngeal recess. 
Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia of superior vena cava: a rare cause of the superior vena cava syndrome. The superior vena cava syndrome associated with an intraluminal vascular proliferative lesion is extremely rare. A case of intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia of the superior vena cava causing obstructive symptoms is reported that was successfully managed by surgical excision. 
Different metastasis patterns of a human melanoma cell line in nude mice and rats: influence of microenvironment. The metastatic capacity of intravenously injected human FEMX-I melanoma cells in athymic nude mice and rats was compared. Young rats given 1 x 10(6) ascites tumor cells all died of lung tumors with a life span of 50 +/- 10 days (mean +/- SD). In contrast, in accordance with previous findings, only extrapulmonary metastases developed in mice. This host-dependent difference in metastasis pattern permitted studies on the role of factors that may influence the organ specificity of metastases. The tissue distribution of 125I-labeled FEMX-I cells did not differ in the two nude species during the first 12 hours after cell injection. The plating efficiency of FEMX-I cells in soft agar was increased by the addition of conditioned medium prepared from rat lungs, resulting also in a significant increase in colony size. In contrast, conditioned medium prepared from mouse lungs reduced the clonogenic capacity of the FEMX-I cells in a dose-dependent manner. Conditioned media prepared from rat and mouse liver, kidney, and spleen tissues either inhibited or had no effect on colony formation. The results suggest that the unexpected differential metastatic patterns observed in vivo may reflect differences in the presence of growth-modulating paracrine factors in the host lungs. 
Body weight is more important than family history of hypertension for left ventricular function. Left ventricular function was studied in young men with a positive family history of hypertension for two generations (n = 15). The findings were compared with three control groups: one age-, sex-, and weight-matched group with a negative family history of hypertension (n = 14); one normotensive control group unselected as regards family history of hypertension (n = 27); and one group also unselected regarding family history of hypertension but selected with blood pressure criteria to have mild blood pressure elevation (n = 59). The group with a positive family history of hypertension, in comparison with the normotensive control group, was heavier, had higher blood pressure, increased left ventricular wall thickness, increased left ventricular mass, and signs of changes in diastolic and systolic left ventricular function. There were no differences in these variables between the group with a positive family history and the other two control groups. Data clearly indicated that subjects with a positive family history of hypertension, as well as subjects with mild blood pressure elevation, were heavier than the normotensive control group. It is not possible to judge, with available data, if the changes in left ventricular morphology and function in the two groups with a different family history of hypertension and in the group with mild blood pressure elevation occurred as a physiological response to the increase in afterload or if the neurohormonal and metabolic disturbances leading to the condition of slight overweight also affected left ventricular function. 
Noninvasive identification of significant narrowing of the left main coronary artery by dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy. To evaluate the usefulness of dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy with low-level exercise for the identification of left main (LM) coronary artery disease (CAD), 466 consecutive patients with CAD were studied. Thirty-eight patients (8%) had LM stenosis (diameter narrowing greater than or equal to 50%). The LM scintigraphic pattern was present in 9 of 38 patients with LMCAD and 38 of 428 CAD patients without LMCAD (24 vs 9%; p less than 0.005). This pattern was present in 6 of 9 patients with LMCAD without right CAD and in only 3 of 29 patients with LM and right CAD (67 vs 10%; p = 0.0005). Patients with LMCAD had a higher incidence of premature cessation of low-level exercise (53 vs 21%; p less than 0.0001), chest pain (68 vs 48%; p less than 0.02), blood pressure decrease of greater than or equal to 20 mm Hg (44 vs 16%; p less than 0.002) and greater ST depression (0.17 +/- 0.13 vs 0.06 +/- 0.10 mV; p less than 0.001) during dipyridamole loading than patients without LMCAD. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that the LM scintigraphic pattern and markers of ischemia during dipyridamole loading best identified (p less than 0.0001) patients with LMCAD without right CAD (sensitivity 67%, specificity 91%), but this predictability is no better than the LM scintigraphic pattern alone. The combination of clinical markers of ischemia during dipyridamole loading and scintigraphic findings of diffuse slow washout, extensive fixed defects and the LM pattern best identified (p less than 0.0001) patients with LM and right CAD (sensitivity 72%, specificity 80%). 
Ankle arthrodesis in children. The indications, surgical technique, and long-term functional results for ankle arthrodesis differ between children and adults. In children, the reasons for performing a tibiotalar fusion include pain, most commonly from traumatic and septic arthritis, and instability from congenital anomalies or paralytic disorders. The most appropriate procedure is Chuinard's fusion, which achieves a tibiotalar fusion without causing a growth arrest of the distal tibial growth plate. In the long term, young patients with ankle arthrodesis function very well with minimal pain or disability. Stressful activities such as hill climbing, stair climbing, and running may be restricted or require compensatory movements. 
Receptor function in heart failure. In patients with congestive heart failure, down-regulation of beta-adrenoceptors is present, probably as a result of sympathetic overstimulation. In end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy, beta 1-adrenoceptor density is markedly reduced, while beta 2-adrenoceptor density is normal. This latter finding does not necessarily imply normal sensitivity to beta 2-stimulation, due to possible alterations in the beta-adrenoceptor/adenylate cyclase complex beyond the receptor. In some disease states, such as ischemic cardiomyopathy and mitral valve disease, there seems to be a concomitant reduction of the beta 1- and beta 2-adrenoceptor density. The finding of beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation has stimulated the search for novel therapeutic approaches in heart failure patients. Beta-agonists could even further down-regulate beta receptors, and this perhaps explains why they seem not to be useful in long-term use. Agents that directly stimulate adenylate cyclase activity, such as forskolin, or that increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate degradation, such as the phosphodiesterase inhibitors, are being tested. Beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents were used in treatment of heart failure before beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation was recognized in these patients. It is tempting to speculate that the beneficial clinical and hemodynamic effects seen in these patients treated with metoprolol is indeed due to an antagonism of the beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation. Studies testing whether beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents can improve survival in congestive heart failure patients are on-going. 
An unknown syndrome of nose deformity, oxycephaly, aplasia of the nasolacrimal ducts, and symmetrical cyst formation on the upper lip in siblings: craniorhiny. An unknown syndrome of oxycephaly, nose deformity, hair growth on the skin at the base of the nose, symmetrical cyst formation on the upper lip, and aplasia of the nasolacrimal ducts in a mother and her three children is presented. This syndrome showed autosomal dominant inheritance. All three children were operated on. Oxycephaly and lip deformity in two of the children and hypertelorism that existed in addition to the other anomalies in the third were all corrected. All corrective surgery was performed during a single session for each child. 
Thrombolytic therapy for myocardial infarction: assessment of efficacy by myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m sestamibi. Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi has been used to evaluate the efficacy of thrombolytic therapy. Improved image quality due to the higher photon energy of Tc-99m and the increased allowable doses of this radiopharmaceutical along with its lack of redistribution makes Tc-99m sestamibi an acceptable imaging agent for such studies. This imaging agent was used for serial quantitative planar and tomographic imaging to assess the initial risk area of infarction, its change over time and the relation to infarct-related artery patency in patients with a first acute myocardial infarction. Twenty-three of 30 patients were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 4 hours after onset of acute chest pain. Seven patients were treated in the conventional manner and did not receive thrombolytic therapy. The initial area at risk varied greatly both in patients treated with rt-PA and in those who received conventional therapy. Patients with successful thrombolysis and patient infarct arteries had a significantly greater reduction of Tc-99m sestamibi defect size than patients who had persistent coronary occlusion. Serial imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi could find important application in future clinical research evaluating the efficacy of new thrombolytic agents. Direct measurements of the amount of hypoperfused myocardium before and after thrombolysis could provide rapid and unequivocal results using fewer patients and avoiding the use of "mortality" as an end point. This approach has not yet been widely tested in the clinical arena. 
Increase in rubella and congenital rubella syndrome--United States, 1988-1990. In 1988, health departments in the United States reported an all-time low of 225 cases of rubella. However, in 1989, the number of reported cases increased nearly twofold, and in 1990, an additional threefold. As of January 4, 1991, a provisional total of 1093 cases (0.4 cases per 100,000 population) had been reported to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) for 1990--the highest total since 1982 (Figure 1). This report summarizes the increase in rubella and congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) since 1988. 
Fanconi's anaemia and post-cricoid carcinoma. A case of post-cricoid carcinoma, occurring in a patient with Fanconi's anaemia is presented. The case illustrates the rare association of the two diseases. The problems with the management of such a case are discussed. 
Cesarean section by local anesthesia in patients with familial dysautonomia. We describe a 29-year-old patient with familial dysautonomia who underwent cesarean section because of severe intrauterine fetal growth retardation. The surgery was done after induction of local anesthesia to avoid the critical and sometimes fatal complications of general anesthesia known in patients with familial dysautonomia. Surgery was uneventful and almost painless. The postoperative period was without complications. Induction of local anesthesia for cesarean section may constitute a suitable alternative in patients with familial dysautonomia. 
Positive role of Clostridium difficile infection in diarrhea in infants and children. A retrospective review of children with Clostridium difficile infection and diarrhea identified 43 patients. Fifteen (35%) had immunoglobulins below the normal range for age, and typified those with transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy, because all increased their levels over the following 12 months. The age of those with hypogammaglobulinemia was significantly younger (p less than 0.01), averaging 18.8 months, than those with normal immunoglobulins who had a mean age of 4.6 yr. The number with recurrent C. difficile infection was significantly greater (p less than 0.001) in the hypogammaglobulinemic group than in those with normal immunoglobulins (46% vs 18%). Eleven children were identified who had C. difficile toxin in the stool after antibiotic therapy, but who had no diarrhea at the time of study. All had normal immunoglobulins. Control patients (20 without and 40 with diarrhea) had no evidence of C. difficile infection, and all but three had normal immunoglobulins. Three (7%) of those with diarrhea had IgA deficiency, and all had a diagnosis of milk protein allergy. These data suggest that immunoglobulin values be obtained in infants and children who have problematic C. difficile diarrhea in order to identify disorders of immunoglobulin synthesis which may be the underlying cause of repeated upper respiratory disease requiring antibiotic usage. 
Are CT scans for head injury patients always necessary? The study reported here sought to identify a group of adult head injury patients in whom computerized axial tomographic (CT) scans were not necessary. The study was limited to patients 18 years of age and older with a history of minor head injury who remained neurologically stable for 20 minutes after arrival at the trauma center, maintained a Glasgow Coma Scale score of at least 13, and had no clinical evidence of basal skull fracture. These patients had a uniformly good neurologic prognosis. The CT scan did not have any prognostic or therapeutic implications. Of a total of 348 patients studied, 12 had an abnormal CT scan with no neurologic deficits or sequelae, and all of them had an uneventful hospital discharge without readmission. It appears that a routine CT scan for minimal head injury patients is an inefficient use of personnel and equipment which may add to the ever increasing financial burden on trauma centers. 
Tocainide therapy in muscle cramps and spasms due to neuromuscular disease. Significant improvement in symptoms of disabling cramps and muscle spasms was obtained in 9 patients with motor neuron diseases, tetany, and myotonic disorders who were treated with tocainide, a lidocaine analog. No significant side effects were observed except for light-headedness and fatigue in 1 patient, who also showed slight prolongation of intraventricular conduction time. Tocainide is useful in treating disabling muscle spasms and cramps associated with conditions characterized by neuromuscular irritability. This effect is probably based on stabilization of the membrane potential at various levels (motor neurons, peripheral nerve, or muscle fiber membrane). 
The relationship of cocaine to headache in polysubstance abusers. In a questionnaire survey of inpatient polysubstance abusers it was found that cocaine relieved migraine-type headaches much more often in chronic headache sufferers than in those with only occasional headaches (p less than .05). However, cocaine could also bring on headaches after several hours, both in chronic headache sufferers and in those not subject to headaches. The facts that cocaine may relieve headache immediately, and also may precipitate headaches several hours after use, suggests that the well-known vasoconstrictive actions of cocaine may be responsible. Migraineurs seem more susceptible to some of these effects of cocaine than are people without chronic headaches. 
Comparison of the ramp versus standard exercise protocols. To compare the hemodynamic and gas exchange responses of ramp treadmill and cycle ergometer tests with standard exercise protocols used clinically, 10 patients with chronic heart failure, 10 with coronary artery disease who were asymptomatic during exercise, 11 with coronary artery disease who were limited by angina during exercise and 10 age-matched normal subjects performed maximal exercise using six different exercise protocols. Gas exchange data were collected continuously during each of the following protocols, performed on separate days in randomized order: Bruce, Balke and an individualized ramp treadmill; 25 W/stage, 50 W/stage and an individualized ramp cycle ergometer test. Maximal oxygen uptake was 16% greater on the treadmill protocols combined (21.4 +/- 8 ml/kg per min) versus the cycle ergometer protocols combined (18.1 +/- 7 ml/kg per min) (p less than 0.01), although no differences were observed in maximal heart rate (131 +/- 24 versus 126 +/- 24 beats/min for the treadmill and cycle ergometer protocols, respectively). No major differences were observed in maximal heart rate or maximal oxygen uptake among the various treadmill protocols or among the various cycle ergometer protocols. The ratio of oxygen uptake to work rate, expressed as a slope, was highest for the ramp tests (slope +/- SEE ml/kg per min = 0.80 +/- 2.5 and 0.78 +/- 1.7 for ramp treadmill and ramp cycle ergometer, respectively). The slopes were poorest for the tests with the largest increments in work (0.62 +/- 4.0 and 0.59 +/- 2.8 for the Bruce treadmill and 50 W/stage cycle ergometer, respectively). 
Complete temporal lobectomy for surgical resuscitation of patients with transtentorial herniation secondary to unilateral hemispheric swelling. Transtentorial herniation is an ominous finding in the patient with head injuries. We report our experience with 10 patients suffering from acute transtentorial herniation secondary to posttraumatic unilateral hemispheric swelling who were treated aggressively with temporal lobectomy. Eight patients were men and 2 were women. Their ages ranged from 22 to 61 years, with a mean of 37 years. Their preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale scores ranged from 3 to 6, with a mean of 4. All patients had both computed tomographic and clinical evidence of unilateral hemispheric shift and acute herniation without a significant subdural or epidural hematoma. Seven patients had unilateral nonreactive pupils and 3 had bilateral nonreactive pupils. All were taken to the operating room within 2 hours of clinical signs of herniation. Complete unilateral temporal lobectomies including the mesial structures, amygdala, and uncus were performed. In this series, the mortality rate was 30%, including a single patient who was neurologically stable but died from nonneurological injuries. Of the 7 survivors, 4 were functionally independent and 3 required minimal assistance with the activities of daily living. Aggressive, early decompression via complete temporal lobectomy may thus significantly improve the outcome in patients with transtentorial herniation accompanying posttraumatic hemispheric swelling and midline shift. 
Localization of urokinase-type plasminogen activator in stromal cells in adenocarcinomas of the colon in humans. Human colon adenocarcinomas and adjacent normal colon tissues were stained immunohistochemically with three different monoclonal antibodies and one preparation of polyclonal antibodies against each of the two plasminogen activators, uPA (urokinase type) and tPA (tissue type). The staining patterns seen with the respective sets of antibodies were identical. In all of 10 cases, staining for uPA in the normal colon tissue was confined to scattered fibroblastlike cells in the lamina propria. Other cells, including epithelial and endothelial cells, were uPA negative. All the tumor infiltrates contained many more uPA-positive cells than the normal tissues, but the staining was confined to fibroblastlike cells and endothelial cells in the tumor stroma, while no staining of the malignant epithelial cells was detected. Analysis for uPA by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in four cases showed an average uPA content of 0.15 ng uPA/mg protein in the normal colon tissues and 1.6 ng uPA/mg protein in the tumors. Tissue-type plasminogen activator immunoreactivity was confined to endothelial cells in both the normal colon tissue and in the colon carcinomas. These findings may indicate that colon cancer cells recruit stromal cells to produce uPA involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix during invasive growth. 
Hemodynamically stable upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This article is a prospective evaluation of 38 patients presenting to an emergency department (ED) with hematemesis but who were otherwise hemodynamically stable. Four patients were admitted, only one because of the development of hemodynamic instability. Thirty-three patients were discharged; on follow-up there was no evidence of major morbidity or mortality. Two patients were lost to follow-up, one who left against medical advice and one who lived in a county outside the service area of our hospital. Patients with hematemesis can be safely discharged from the ED after observation for 6 hours if they: (1) lack orthostatic vital sign changes; (2) lack associated significant underlying disease; (3) have a hemoglobin concentration greater than 10 gm/dL; (4) are less than 60 years of age; and (5) are thought to be reliable and compliant. 
Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific intravenous immunoglobulin for the prevention of primary CMV infection and disease after marrow transplant. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific immunoglobulin (IVIG) was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial in CMV-seronegative marrow transplant patients with seropositive marrow donors for the prevention of primary CMV infection during the first 100 days after transplant. Patients received 200 mg/kg CMV IVIG on days 8 and 6 before transplant, the day after transplant, weekly for the first month, and then every 2 weeks to complete 10 doses. Patients were followed with weekly CMV cultures and serologic studies and for clinical and histologic evidence of CMV disease. Sixty patients were evaluable in each group. There was significantly less CMV excretion (P = .04) and viremia (P = .01) in the treatment group. However, the incidence of CMV disease including CMV pneumonia, CMV enteritis, and CMV syndrome (fever, leukopenia, hepatitis) was not statistically different. There was also no difference in median time of onset of CMV infection or disease, median number of hospital days, or survival between the two groups. 
Surgical correction of coarctation in early infancy: does surgical technique influence the result? Between 1979 and 1988, a total of 53 infants less than 1 year of age underwent repair of coarctation. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were younger than 3 months. Median age was 0.9 month. Four different surgical techniques were used: resection with end-to-end anastomosis, patch enlargement, subclavian flap aortoplasty, and subclavian displacement aortoplasty (Meier-Mendonca technique). Hospital mortality was 7.5% and was limited to patients with additional complex intracardiac defects. Neither age nor surgical technique had an influence on the operative risk. Follow-up averaged 15 to 43 months for the four different groups. Restenosis developed in 9 (19%) of 47 patients regularly followed up, 5 (11%) of whom have had reoperation. Age at operation was not a predictor for restenosis, which occurred in 17.4% of patients less than 1 month and 20.8% of those greater than 1 month of age at operation. Patch enlargement and the subclavian displacement technique demonstrated the highest restenosis rates (42% and 43%, respectively). However, patients who underwent patch enlargement had less favorable pathological conditions. It is concluded that results of coarctation repair in early infancy do not depend as much on the operative method itself as on the specific pathological aspect, which largely determines the method of treatment. Some reservation must be made in regard to the subclavian displacement technique. 
Nonlymphoblastic lymphoma in children--histology and stage-related response to therapy: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. From May 1979 to March 1983, 93 eligible patients with nonlymphoblastic lymphoma (NLBL) were treated by members of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) with Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), vincristine, prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and mercaptopurine (ACOP+); CNS prophylaxis with intrathecal (IT) methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cranial irradiation (2,400 rads), and radiation therapy to the primary disease were administered in stages I and II, and to residual disease in stages III and IV. Duration of treatment was 2 years for stages I, II, and III and 3 years for stage IV disease. Of the 93 patients entered onto the study, 47 had diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma (DSNCL), 38 had diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL), and eight had other histologies. Localized disease (stages I and II) was present in 51 patients, and 42 had advanced (stages III and IV) disease. The study confirmed previously reported importance of stage with a 4-year event-free survival (EFS) of 78% (SE +/- 7%) for patients with localized disease as compared with 44% (SE +/- 9%) in patients with advanced disease (P less than or equal to .001). In localized disease, seven of 11 adverse events occurred in patients who were off therapy and more than 30 months after the initial diagnosis (relapse, three; second malignancy, two; death in remission, two). Large-cell histology proved to be an important prognostic factor in patients with stages III and IV disease with EFS at 4 years of 67% (SE +/- 11%) for DLCL versus 17% (SE +/- 11%) for DSNCL (P less than or equal to .001). We conclude that it is important to distinguish histologically between small noncleaved-cell and large-cell types of NLBL as a basis for further controlled clinical trials. 
National surveillance of dialysis-associated diseases in the United States, 1989. To determine trends in a variety of dialysis-associated diseases and practices, the Centers for Disease Control surveyed 1,867 chronic hemodialysis centers in the United States in 1989 in conjunction with the annual facility survey performed by the Health Care Financing Administration. The response rate to a mailed questionnaire was 92%. These 1,726 centers represented 122,734 patients and 32,486 staff members. The following results were found. 1) During the last 14 years, the incidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection decreased from 3.0 to 0.1% among patients, and from 2.6 to 0.1% among staff members. Over the same time, the prevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity declined from 7.8 to 1.4% among patients and from 0.9 to 0.3% among staff members. Hepatitis B vaccine was given by 92% of the centers. By the end of 1989, 19% of susceptible patients and 55% of susceptible staff members had received all three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. From 1982 to 1989, as a result of receiving vaccine, the prevalence of antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) increased from 12 to 19% among patients and from 18 to 54% among staff. The incidence of non-A, non-B hepatitis in 1989 was reported to be 0.7% among patients and 0.1% among staff members. 2) Twenty-two percent of the centers reported pyrogenic reactions in the absence of septicemia among their patients, and 51% reported septicemia. 3) The reported incidence of dialysis dementia among hemodialysis patients was 0.2%, with a case fatality rate of 23%. 4) In 1989, 68% of centers reported that they reused disposable dialyzers; these centers treated 73% of the dialysis patient population. Among centers that reused disposable dialyzers, the average number of reuses ranged from 1 to 50 (mean, 12) and the maximum number of times a disposable dialyzer was ever reused ranged from 3 to 150 (mean, 28). Chemical germicides used for reprocessing dialyzers included formaldehyde, Renalin (a peracetic acid-hydrogen peroxide-based germicide), and glutaraldehyde-based germicides. Reuse of disposable dialyzers was not associated with any increased risk of acquiring HBV infection among either patients or staff. However, pyrogenic reactions occurring in clusters were reported more frequently in centers that reused conventional dialyzer membranes compared with centers that did not. This increased risk was associated only with centers that used Renalin or glutaraldehyde for reprocessing (not formaldehyde) and occurred with both automated and manual reprocessing systems.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Acute appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma. Incidence or coincidence? Inflammation of the appendix is a common cause of acute abdominal pain. The etiology and pathophysiology of appendicitis have been well described. The initiating factor often is obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by inspissated stool, barium, food, parasites, or hyperplastic lymphoid tissue. Two patients have been identified who developed appendicitis temporally related to blunt abdominal trauma, without other clear etiology. Although absolute documentation of trauma as an etiologic factor in these cases is difficult, theoretical mechanisms for the occurrence are discussed. In the setting of right lower quadrant pain following mild to moderate blunt abdominal trauma, acute appendicitis should be considered as a possibility. 
Limited efficacy of leukopoor platelets for prevention of febrile transfusion reactions. Leukopoor red cell components have a reduced incidence of febrile transfusion reactions. An analogous efficacy for leukopoor platelets has not been convincingly established. The authors analyzed the transfusion records of 36 patients (26 women, 10 men) who received leukopoor platelets following febrile reactions to unmodified platelets. These patients received 409 unmodified transfusions (mean/patient 11) with 84 febrile reactions (rate 20.5%). Reaction rates to unmodified, non-HLA-matched single donor platelets (14.0%) and HLA-matched platelets (6.5%) were significantly lower than to pooled concentrates (27.2%) (P less than .01 and P less than .001, respectively). Of 623 leukopoor transfusions (mean/patient 17), 84 resulted in reactions (13.5%). Although leukodepletion significantly lowered the overall reaction rate as compared with unmodified products (P less than .02), a majority of patients (28 of 36) continued to have reactions. When individual reaction rates to unmodified and leukopoor transfusions were compared, only two patients showed a significant decrease in their reaction rate with leukopoor platelets. It appears that most susceptible patients continue to react to leukopoor platelets, particularly when pooled concentrates are used, and many patients show no reduction in reaction rate. 
Ryanodine contracture: a potentially specific in vitro diagnostic test for malignant hyperthermia. In vitro contracture tests used currently for malignant hyperthermia (MH) do not possess absolute specificity. This is potentially a great problem in the study of the genetic approach which offers the best prospect for the development of a non-invasive diagnostic test for the condition. The calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been proposed as the site of the MH defect. Ryanodine, which binds avidly to this channel, was shown to differentiate between muscle of MH susceptible and normal patients in terms of in vitro contracture response. This ryanodine contracture response is proposed as a potentially specific in vitro diagnostic test for MH. 
Pharmacologically based dosing of etoposide: a means of safely increasing dose intensity. We have previously demonstrated that individualized dosing of etoposide (VP16) by 72-hour infusion is feasible and that the extent of leukopenia is a function of plasma concentration, pretreatment WBC (WBCp), albumin (ALB), performance status (PS), and bone marrow function (based on transfusion requirements). In the current study, 45 patients were randomized between a fixed dose of VP16 (125 mg/m2/d) versus individualized dosing to a target WBC nadir (WBCN) of 1,700/microL. The total dose was increased by an average of 22% in the latter patients (459 +/- 130 mg/m2 v 375 mg/m2, P = .002). This was associated with a decrease in both the mean WBCN (1,510 +/- 950 v 2,500 +/- 1,420/microL, P = .013) and in the variability of the WBCN (P = .039). The VP16 clearance (mL/min) was not correlated with body surface area. Partial responses were observed in one patient each with hepatoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. We conclude that pharmacologically based dosing may be a means of increasing dose intensity without increasing the incidence of life-threatening toxicity due to a decrease in variability around a target WBC. 
Efficacy and safety of intravenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone: Lutrepulse for injection. A multicenter trial was undertaken to assess the ability of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone to restore physiologic ovulatory function in women with diminished or absent pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. In 109 women with primary and secondary hypothalamic amenorrhea, pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Lutrepulse [gonadorelin acetate] for Injection) was extremely effective, resulting in ovulation in 91% and 96% of patients, respectively. Overall complications of intravenous line placement ranged from 0% to 11% (mean = 7%). A 12% incidence of multiple pregnancy was noted, and a single case of ovarian hyperstimulation was reported in a woman who also received clomiphene citrate. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment appears to be of at least comparable efficacy to human menopausal gonadotropins, with the added benefit of reduced overall risks for the patient with hypothalamic amenorrhea. 
The danger of an ultra-early computed tomographic scan in a patient with an evolving acute epidural hematoma. A case of an acute traumatic epidural hematoma that developed after an ultra-early computed tomographic scan of the head is discussed. Serial neurological examinations in patients with head injuries are recommended. 
Epidemiology of encephalitis in children: a 20-year survey. Four hundred five children from the Helsinki area who were 1 month to 16 years old were treated for acute encephalitis at the Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, from January 1968 through December 1987. Encephalitis occurred most commonly in children 1 to 1.9 years of age, among whom the incidence was 16.7 per 100,000 child-years. The incidence remained quite high until the age of 10 years, and then gradually declined to 1.0 per 100,000 child-years at the age of 15 years. Since 1983, when mumps, measles, and rubella vaccination eradicated the encephalitides associated with these microbes, the major associated agents have been varicella-zoster, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory and enteroviruses. In infants younger than 1 year of age, the major agents were enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and the group of "others," whereas in older children, respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as varicella-zoster virus, dominated. In children aged 1 to 11 months, the causal agent could not be identified in one-half of all cases, whereas in children who were at least 10 years old, the etiology remained unknown in only one-fourth of cases. Male dominance was most evident in the 4- to 9-year age group. The difference in etiology between males and females was significant (p = 0.02); mumps and varicella were more common in boys, and adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were more common in girls. The overall male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1. Characteristic seasonal variation occurred in encephalitides associated with mumps, measles, and entero- and respiratory viruses. 
Dietary calcium and blood pressure: modifying factors in specific populations. Epidemiologic findings continue to add to the body of evidence supporting a relationship between calcium intake and blood pressure. These findings also indicate that there is a threshold of the potential protective effect of adequate calcium intake, below which the risk of hypertension increases at a greater rate. The set point of this threshold, estimated at 700-800 mg/d, may be modified by a variety of factors including dietary patterns and components, lifestyle, and genetics. This may explain, at least in part, the heterogeneous response observed in dietary-intervention studies. In animal models of hypertension it was shown that greater amounts of calcium must be given to cause a blood pressure change comparable with that in normal animals, suggesting that in high-risk human populations in which calcium metabolism may be disordered, calcium intake may have to be increased to amounts greater than 700-800 mg/d to demonstrate the blood-pressure-lowering effect. Calcium intake at or above the currently recommended daily allowance of 800 mg could be of potential benefit to certain racial groups, individuals ingesting excessive alcohol, and pregnant women, all of whom generally consume low amounts of calcium and who are at higher risk of developing hypertension. 
Second occurrence of spinal epidural metastases. We reviewed records of 79 men with spinal epidural metastases diagnosed from July 1984 to July 1989, imaged by myelography or MRI, and treated with radiation therapy. Thirteen men (16%) had second epidural metastases. The mean time between lesions that developed within two vertebral bodies of a prior lesion was 2.8 months, compared with 15.2 months for lesions that were three or more vertebral bodies from a prior lesion. Some secondary spinal metastases occurring soon after the initial metastasis may represent regrowth of tumor at the border of the radiation port, suggesting that larger radiation ports be constructed for patients with lengthy expected survival times. 
Plasma chromogranin A + B, neuropeptide Y and catecholamines in pheochromocytoma patients. Plasma levels of chromogranin A + B, neuropeptide Y and catecholamines were analysed before, during and after surgery in seven patients with pheochromocytoma. The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic sensitivity of these plasma amines and peptides, and to investigate their peroperative fluctuations. Chromogranin A + B in plasma was increased preoperatively in all patients, showed no significant increase during surgery, and normalized postoperatively. Neuropeptide Y, which alone can induce hypertension, was present in high levels in plasma from three patients preoperatively, increased further in four patients during surgery, and was postoperatively low in all patients. Fractionated plasma catecholamines were increased in five patients before surgery, increased in all patients during tumour dissection, and normalized postoperatively. It may be concluded that plasma chromogranin A + B exhibited as high a sensitivity for pheochromocytoma as fractionated urinary catecholamines in the patients studied. 
An analysis of cerebral blood flow in acute closed-head injury using technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT and computed tomography. Technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine (HMPAO) SPECT and x-ray CT were compared in 15 patients with acute closed-head injury. There were 44 focal lesions in all. Fifteen (34%) lesions were seen on both x-ray and SPECT. Seventeen (39%) lesions were seen only on SPECT. Twelve (27%) of the lesions were seen on x-ray tomography only. Of the lesions seen on x-ray tomography but not on SPECT, two were subarachnoid hemorrhage, two were thin subdural hematomas, and eight were contusions. This study shows that SPECT can detect focal disturbances of cerebral blood flow that are not seen on x-ray tomography. It also suggests that there are two types of contusions: those with a decreased cerebral blood flow (i.e., detectable on SPECT) and those with a cerebral blood flow equal to that of the surrounding brain. 
Parasympathetic withdrawal is an integral component of autonomic imbalance in congestive heart failure: demonstration in human subjects and verification in a paced canine model of ventricular failure. Although enhanced sympathetic tone is a well recognized component of the autonomic profile characteristic of congestive heart failure, the contribution of parasympathetic withdrawal to this autonomic imbalance is less well described. The technique of spectral analysis of heart rate variability provides a dynamic map of sympathetic and parasympathetic tone and was thus used to define the nature of sympathetic-parasympathetic interactions in humans with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and in a paced canine model of congestive heart failure. Humans with cardiomyopathy were found to have an augmentation of the sympathetically mediated low frequency area of the power density spectrum. Parasympathetic withdrawal was demonstrated by significant reductions in the parasympathetically mediated high frequency area (p less than 0.05) and the ratio of high to low frequency areas (p less than 0.01). Administration of atropine to normal subjects resulted in a significant reduction in the high frequency area (p less than 0.05) and the high/low frequency area ratio, both of which decreased within the range noted in patients with congestive heart failure. Administration of isoproterenol in normal subjects led to an augmentation of the low frequency area but to only a small decrease in the high/low frequency area ratio. Induction of congestive heart failure in a paced canine model resulted in alterations in the autonomic profile that resembled those seen in humans with ventricular failure. The prominent high frequency region of the spectrum at baseline, indicating a predominance of parasympathetic tone, was absent after the evolution of congestive heart failure, and there was a marked augmentation of the low frequency region of the spectrum. 
Analysis of morbidity and mortality rates in right hepatectomy with the preoperative APACHE II score. Morbidity and mortality rates in 70 patients who underwent major liver resection for liver tumors (primary and metastatic) were determined and correlated with the preoperative APACHE II score. Patients were divided into three groups according to their preoperative APACHE II score: low (0 to 3), mid (4 to 7), and high (8 and above). A higher score was closely correlated with increased postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates. The group with low scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 34% and a mortality rate of 0%, the group with mid scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 54% and a mortality rate of 3%, and the group with high scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 80% and a mortality rate of 20%. Age did not correlate with morbidity. It was therefore postulated that morbidity and mortality rates were related to the combination of points for abnormal physiologic variables and points for chronic health, or APACHE II score minus points for age. As the combination of these points increases the postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates increase significantly (from 24% in the 0-point group to 69% in the greater than or equal to 3-point group). Also the two deaths occurred in the group with 3 or more points. The preoperative APACHE II score may be used by clinicians to evaluate before surgery the risk of postoperative morbidity and death in elective major liver surgery. 
Dietary fish oil blocks the microcirculatory manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury in striated muscle in hamsters. Epidemiologic observations and experimental studies have demonstrated a protective effect of dietary fish oil on the clinical manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we used the dorsal skinfold chamber model for intravital fluorescence microscopy of the microcirculation in striated muscle of awake hamsters. In control hamsters (n = 7), reperfusion after a 4-hr pressure-induced ischemia to the muscle tissue elicited the adhesion of fluorescently stained leukocytes to the endothelium of postcapillary venules, capillary obstruction, and the break-down of endothelial integrity. These microvascular manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury were significantly attenuated in animals (n = 7) when fed with a fish oil-enriched diet for 4 weeks prior to the experiments. In leukocyte total lipids, the fish oil diet resulted in a substantial displacement of arachidonic acid, the precursor of the potent adhesion-promoting leukotriene (LT) B4, by fish oil-derived eicosapentaenoic acid, the precursor of biologically less potent LTB5, emphasizing the mediator role of LTB4 in ischemia-reperfusion injury. These results suggest that the preservation of microvascular perfusion by dietary fish oil contributes to its protective effects on the clinical manifestations of ischemia-reperfusion injury. 
Comparison of effects of thrombolytic therapy on left ventricular function in patients over with those under 60 years of age. This study examined the effect of age on left ventricular (LV) function, assessed by contrast ventriculography 3 weeks after a first acute myocardial infarction in 312 patients who received thrombolytic therapy within 4 hours of the onset of infarction and in 83 patients who received placebo. Streptokinase was given to 188 patients and recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to 124. Patients were divided into 2 age groups: less than 60 years (n = 244) and greater than or equal to 60 years (n = 151). Thrombolytic therapy improved ejection fraction in both age groups: from 54 +/- 13 to 59 +/- 11% (p = 0.021) in the younger group and from 50 +/- 14 to 57 +/- 13% (p = 0.004) in the older group. Ejection fraction was identical in streptokinase- and rt-PA-treated patients. Multifactor analysis of variance revealed that younger age and thrombolytic therapy were independently associated with improved ejection fraction. Thrombolytic therapy also reduced end-systolic volume (p = 0.001) by 14 ml in the elderly and 9 ml in the younger group. Minor bleeding complications were more frequent in the elderly and 3 serious hemorrhages occurred in patients greater than or equal to 60 years. These findings reveal that thrombolysis improves LV function in all age groups studied. Because increasing age is independently associated with a lower ejection fraction after acute myocardial infarction, thrombolytic therapy may confer greater benefits in older patients. 
Dose-related effects of isoflurane associated with low plasma concentrations of verapamil on global and regional function in normal and compromised canine myocardium. Global and regional myocardial functions were studied in seven open-chest dogs with constant low plasma concentrations of verapamil as increasing concentrations of isoflurane (0.75, 1, 1.5 MAC) were administered in the presence of normal myocardial perfusion and after application of critical constriction of the left anterior descending coronary artery. In the presence of verapamil, increases in isoflurane concentrations caused dose-dependent myocardial depression both before and after critical coronary constriction. The systemic and coronary vasodilatation associated with high concentrations of isoflurane did not occur in the presence of verapamil. The association of verapamil with isoflurane caused regional myocardial dysfunction that worsened at high isoflurane concentrations. This regional dysfunction could not be antagonized in two dogs. The effects of isoflurane on regional function were not modified by application of a critical coronary constriction. 
Intermittent long-term adrenocorticosteroid treatment of myasthenia gravis. It is widely accepted that a long-term, alternate-day administration of adrenal corticosteroids after thymectomy is one of the most effective treatments of myasthenia gravis. However, some patients with myasthenia gravis show a tendency to develop steroid dependency, and require extremely prolonged administration of fairly high doses of steroids. Various types of adverse reactions to steroids are likely to occur in such cases. To avoid this, intermittent, single-dose administration of steroids was performed on a trial basis in the present study. Prednisolone, in doses of 50-100 mg, was given once every 3-7 days in three steroid-dependent myasthenic patients, in one case for up to 6 years. The effects of the intermittent treatment were as good as, and adverse effects less frequently found than in single-dose, alternate-day administration. 
Peritoneal adhesion formation after lysis: inhibition by polyethylene glycol 4000. Peritoneal adhesions cause much long-term postoperative morbidity. This study evaluates the efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 in reducing adhesion reformation after lysis. Adhesions were induced, by abrasion, in 111 Sprague-Dawley rats at a first laparotomy. At a second operation, 10 days later, these adhesions were graded and lysed, after which the animals received one of the following solutions intraperitoneally: 5 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 21), 25 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 23), 32 per cent dextran 70 (n = 22) or isotonic saline (n = 25), or were left as an untreated control group (n = 20). When the reformed adhesions were graded after a further 10 days 5 per cent PEG 4000 was found to be the only solution that inhibited adhesion reformation. The adhesions that reformed in the other four test groups were significantly worse than when they were first graded (P less than or equal to 0.033 for all groups). Therefore 5 per cent PEG 4000 may be useful in clinical practice for the reduction of adhesion formation after lysis. 
Parathyroid hormone-related protein of malignancy: immunohistochemical and biochemical studies in normocalcaemic and hypercalcaemic patients with cancer. Immunohistochemical staining for parathyroid hormone-related protein was performed in 27 tumours from 19 normocalcaemic and eight hypercalcaemic patients with cancer. All the tumours from hypercalcaemic patients stained positively for the protein, as did 17 tumours from normocalcaemic patients. Only hypercalcaemic patients had biochemical evidence of increased bone resorption and abnormalities of renal tubular reabsorption of calcium and phosphate, consistent with the presence of parathyroid hormone-related protein. While tumour mass was higher in hypercalcaemic patients, only one of the initially normocalcaemic patients with positively staining tumours subsequently went on to develop hypercalcaemia and more advanced disease. These data confirm the importance of parathyroid hormone-related protein as a mediator of humoral hypercalcaemia in patients with solid tumours and suggest that low tumour mass may be one reason why serum calcium values are not increased in all patients with tumours containing parathyroid hormone-related protein. None the less normocalcaemia, despite tumour progression in patients whose tumours stained positively for parathyroid hormone-related protein, suggests that other factors may also be important, such as differences in the rate of secretion of the protein by different tumours, or the production of different forms of parathyroid hormone-related protein with varying biological effects. 
Association of sebaceous gland tumors and internal malignancy: the Muir-Torre syndrome. The Muir-Torre syndrome (MTS) is an autosomal dominant genodermatosis characterized by: (1) at least a single sebaceous gland tumor (either an adenoma, an epithelioma, or a carcinoma) and (2) a minimum of one internal malignancy. To date, 120 patients with MTS have been reported. The most commonly associated neoplasms were colorectal (51%) and genitourinary (25%). Unlike colorectal neoplasms in the general population, the majority (58%) of these tumors in MTS patients occurred proximal to or at the splenic flexure. Nearly half of the MTS patients had more than one primary malignancy. Cutaneous lesions occurred before or concurrent with the diagnosis of the initial cancer in 41% of these patients. The median age for the appearance of the skin lesions was 53 years (range, 23 to 89 years); the median age for the detection of the initial visceral neoplasm was 50 years (range, 23 to 81 years). The cancers appear to have an indolent course in many of the MTS patients; the median survival has not been reached and the median follow-up is 10+ years. Patients with an MTS-associated cutaneous lesion should have a complete evaluation for gastrointestinal or genitourinary cancers. Although the penetrance of this disease is variable, its autosomal dominant inheritance suggests that relatives should be examined for sebaceous gland tumors and internal malignancy. 
Lymphoproliferative disorders of the thyroid gland: radiological appearances. Images of lymphoproliferative disorders of the thyroid by ultrasonography (US), computed tomography (CT), 99Tcm and 67Ga scintigraphy were analysed in eight patients (two men and six women, aged 42-83 years). Seven patients were diagnosed as having primary lymphoma and one plasmacytoma. Ultrasound revealed a solid mass with homogeneous and very low echogenicity clearly distinguishable from residual thyroid tissue in five patients, diffuse hypoechoic goitre in one and multiple irregular hypoechoic nodules in both lobes in the patient with plasmacytoma (Case 8). Computed tomography demonstrated a focal low-density area in six cases of lymphoma and decreased density throughout the gland in the other two patients. 99Tcm scintigraphy showed hemilobar enlargement with decreased and uneven trapping, cold area or complete lobar defect in six patients with lymphoma and no trapping in the case of plasmacytoma. 67Ga scintigraphy demonstrated high accumulation in lymphoma and faint accumulation in the case of plasmacytoma. Radiological manifestations with a focal lesion were considered typical and diagnostic of primary thyroid lymphoma, while in one case with diffuse infiltration through the whole gland, the differential diagnosis from Hashimoto's thyroiditis could not be made. In the final case, cells infiltrated diffusely to form islands with patchy distribution among well preserved follicles, correlating with the multiple hypoechoic areas observed by US. 
Diagnosis of mitral valve aneurysm by transoesophageal echocardiography. In a patient with mitral valve aneurysm precordial echocardiography suggested a mistaken diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Transoesophageal echocardiographic examination established the correct diagnosis, which was subsequently confirmed at operation. Transoesophageal echocardiography gives better resolution of lesions associated with the mitral valve than precordial examination and may improve the diagnostic accuracy. 
Inhibition of entry of HIV-1 in neural cell lines by antibodies against galactosyl ceramide. Although the CD4 molecule is the principal cellular receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), several CD4-negative cell lines are susceptible to infection with one or more HIV strains. These findings indicate that there are alternate modes of viral entry, perhaps involving one or more receptor molecules. Antibodies against galactosyl ceramide (galactocerebroside, or GalC) inhibited viral internalization and infection in two CD4-negative cell lines derived from the nervous system: U373-MG and SK-N-MC. Furthermore, recombinant HIV surface glycoprotein gp120 bound to GalC but not to other glycolipids. These results suggest a role for GalC or a highly related molecule in HIV entry into neural cells. 
Listeria monocytogenes infections in patients with AIDS: report of five cases and review. Five patients with AIDS and Listeria monocytogenes infection (three cases of bacteremia and two of meningitis) are reviewed. Four patients had prior or concurrent gastrointestinal illness. Two patients received corticosteroids. A 7- to 21-day course of ampicillin was administered with or without a 7- to 14-day course of gentamicin. This regimen was effective, with no evidence of relapse 7-8 months after therapy was discontinued. The relative infrequency of infection with L. monocytogenes in AIDS patients is unexpected. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) appears to be essential in the inhibition of Listeria in vivo. Elevated levels of TNF in AIDS patients may be protective against listeriosis and thus help explain the low prevalence of listerial infection in this population. Nonetheless, although L. monocytogenes is an uncommon cause of illness in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, it cannot be dismissed as a cause of undefined meningitis or sepsis. 
Molecular and phenotypic analysis of patients with deletions within the deletion-rich region of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene. Eighty unrelated individuals with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) were found to have deletions in the major deletion-rich region of the DMD locus. This region includes the last five exons detected by cDNA5b-7, all exons detected by cDNA8, and the first two exons detected by cDNA9. These 80 individuals account for approximately 75% of 109 deletions of the gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed with the entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints for many of these deletions were further characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) and GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings are presented for all 80 patients allowing a correlation of phenotypic severity with the genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients were old enough to be classified as DMD, BMD, or intermediate phenotype and had deletions of exons with sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients and one intermediate patient had gene deletions predicted to leave the reading frame intact, while 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, and 1 BMD patient had gene deletions predicted to disrupt the reading frame. Thus, with two exceptions, frameshift deletions of the gene resulted in more severe phenotype than did in-frame deletions. This is in agreement with recent findings by Baumbach et al. and Koenig et al. but is in contrast to findings, by Malhotra et al., at the 5' end of the gene. 
Age-specific differences in the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast cancer. Nearly all studies have suggested that the use of oral contraceptives (OC) is not associated with the aggregate risk of breast cancer diagnosed in women aged 20-54. Because of age-specific differences in the breast cancer-parity relationship and because of age-specific differences in other breast cancer risk factors, the Centers for Disease Control reexamined data from the Cancer and Steroid Hormone Study to assess whether OC use has different effects on the risk of breast cancer at different ages of diagnosis. This was a population-based case-control study conducted in eight geographic areas in the United States during 1980-1982. In these data, the relationship between the risk of breast cancer and OC use appeared to vary by age at diagnosis. Among women aged 20-34 years at diagnosis or interview, those who had ever used OC had a slightly increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.0-2.1) when compared with women of the same ages who had never used OC. Among these women, there were no trends of increasing or decreasing risk with any measure of OC use. Among women aged 35-44 years, there was no association between OC use and breast cancer. Among women aged 45-54 years, those who used OC had a slightly decreased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio 0.9, 95% confidence interval 0.8-1.0). Among these women, the risk estimates decreased significantly with increasing time since first and last use. Although the slightly increased risk estimates for the youngest women are compatible with findings by other investigators, the decreased risk estimates for the oldest women have not been described in as many studies. Available data provide no reasons for changes in prescribing practices or in the use of OC as related to breast cancer risk. 
Delayed postanoxic encephalopathy after strangulation. Serial neuroradiological and neurochemical studies. A 13-year-old boy was the victim of attempted strangulation. His condition had returned to normal by the sixth day after the assault; however, from the seventh day, choreoathetosis, dystonia, and marked pseudobulbar paralysis developed in the boy. The computed tomographic scans and T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that were obtained at this time revealed low-density and high-signal intensities in the region of the bilateral putamen and caudate nucleus. These symptoms and the changes in his computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance images subsided gradually during a 2-month period. Sequential analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid for gamma-aminobutyric acid and dopamine concentrations during his illness revealed reciprocal changes with normal recovery. Because of the delayed onset of neurological changes and the cerebrospinal fluid showing reversible symptoms, the delayed encephalopathy after strangulation had been related to the biochemical alterations that followed anoxia in the vulnerable basal ganglia. 
Isolated angiitis of the central nervous system: involvement of penetrating vessels at the base of the brain. Isolated angiitis of the central nervous system (IAC) was diagnosed in a 40-year-old Caucasian male by histological examination of a leptomeningeal biopsy specimen, and the exclusion of systemic inflammatory or infective disease. Therapy with prednisone 30 mg/day and cyclophosphamide 100 mg/day resulted in clinical and radiological improvement, which have been maintained for an 8-month follow-up period. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions implicating involvement of specific penetrating vessels at the base of the brain, an unusual complication of IAC, and allowed an accurate MRI-clinical correlation. 
Current status of coronary artery operation in septuagenarians. Previous reports of elderly patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting have not addressed the current era of aggressive percutaneous angioplasty and frequent urgent or emergent operation. To investigate this important subgroup of patients, we analyzed our recent coronary artery bypass grafting experience with patients 70 years of age or older. From January 1984 to January 1989, 121 consecutive patients in this age range underwent surgical revascularization at our institution. Overall in-hospital operative mortality (OM) was 7.4% (9/121), with 77.8% (7/9) of deaths due to cardiac causes. Serious postoperative morbidity occurred in 71.1% (86/121). Surgical priority was significantly correlated with operative mortality: for elective cases, the OM was 2.9% (2/68), but it was 8.6% (3/35) for urgent cases (p less than 0.05) and 22.2% (4/18) for emergency cases (p less than 0.05). Univariate analysis isolated the need for inotropic support, intraaortic balloon pump, reoperation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and emergency status as significant risk factors for OM (p less than 0.05). Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis identified the need for inotropic support, intravenous nitroglycerin, reoperative coronary artery bypass grafting, and hypertension as independently significant risk factors. A logistic risk equation developed from this population accurately modeled OM at the extremes of operative risk. Three (3.1%) of the 97 patients predicted to have less than 5% OM died, whereas all patients predicted by the model to have greater than 90% OM died. These results indicate that in spite of relatively high morbidity and mortality rates, elderly patients have a very acceptable operative risk in the current era of high-risk coronary artery bypass grafting. This is particularly true if elective revascularization is possible. 
Minimal role of xanthine oxidase and oxygen free radicals in rat renal tubular reoxygenation injury. The role of xanthine oxidase and oxygen free radicals in postischemic reperfusion injury in the rat kidney remains controversial. Proximal tubules, the focal segment affected by ischemic renal injury, were isolated in bulk, assayed for xanthine oxidase activity, and subjected to 60 min of anoxia or hypoxia and 60 min of reoxygenation to evaluate the participation of xanthine oxidase and oxygen radicals in proximal tubule reoxygenation injury. The total xanthine oxidase in isolated rat proximal tubules was 1.1 mU/mg of protein, approximately 30% to 40% of the activity found in rat intestine and liver. Lactate dehydrogenase release, an indicator of irreversible cell damage, increased substantially during anoxia (39.8 +/- 2.3 versus 9.8 +/- 1.8% in controls) with an additional 8 to 12% release during reoxygenation. Addition of 0.2 mM allopurinol, a potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and dimethylthiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, failed to protect against the reoxygenation lactate dehydrogenase release. Analysis of xanthine oxidase substrate levels after anoxia and flux rates during reoxygenation indicates that hypoxanthine and xanthine concentrations are in a 15-fold excess over the enzyme Km and 0.3 mU/mg of protein of xanthine oxidase activity exists during reoxygenation. Hypoxic tubule suspensions had a minimal lactate dehydrogenase release during hypoxia and failed to demonstrate accelerated injury upon reoxygenation. In conclusion, although xanthine oxidase is present and active during reoxygenation in isolated rat proximal tubules, oxygen radicals did not mediate reoxygenation injury. 
The ethics of nontreatment of patients with cancers of the head and neck. There are three levels at which nontreatment decisions for patients with cancers of the head and neck might be made: not doing further diagnostic procedures when the data gained would not make a significant difference to treatment decisions; not continuing aggressive therapy when its benefits are outweighed by the ensuing burdens and harms; and, at the policy level, not providing costly aggressive therapy at all because of the number of patients with unmet, more basic needs. These three levels of nontreatment decisions are discussed in light of ethical theory, briefly introduced. Arguments are made in favor of nontreatment decisions at the two clinical levels mentioned above, but against a policy decision to ration treatment for patients with cancers of the head and neck. 
Outcome in children who nearly drown: a British Isles study OBJECTIVE--To determine the outcome in nearly drowned children in the British Isles and identify factors that might predict a poor prognosis. DESIGN--Study of drowned and of nearly drowned children aged less than or equal to 14. Information on nearly drowned children admitted to hospital obtained from consultant paediatricians returning monthly notification cards through the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Information on drowned children obtained from Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and other national epidemiological offices. SETTING--British Isles, 1988 and 1989. SUBJECTS--330 children who had confirmed submersion incidents. 142 died before admission to hospital and 188 children were admitted after nearly drowning. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death, full recovery, or degree of handicap after near drowning and signs on admission to hospital. RESULTS--All of the children who were conscious on admission fully recovered. Of the 64 children unconscious on admission, 31 had normally reactive pupils and all but three (all of whom had severe preexisting neurological disease) recovered fully. Of the 33 children with fixed dilated pupils on admission, 10 fully recovered, 13 died, and 10 had severe neurological deficit. Spontaneous respiratory effect on admission was associated with normal survival. Pupils that remained dilated six hours after admission and fits continuing 24 hours after admission predicted a poor outcome. CONCLUSION--Children can survive normally after near drowning in the British Isles, particularly if they have been hypothermic. Resuscitation should not be abandoned in nearly drowned children until they have been rewarmed. 
Hemangiopericytoma of the lacrimal sac. Hemangiopericytomas of the orbit are rare tumors with low malignancy potential. To the authors' knowledge, only three previous cases of these tumors occurring in the lacrimal sac have been reported. The authors report a fourth case. Follow-up was obtained on the first reported case, and the patient in that case had a recurrence after 15 years. These tumors should be totally excised and followed for long periods of time. 
Anaerobic pathogenesis: collagenase production by Peptostreptococcus magnus and its relationship to site of infection. Fifty isolates of Peptostreptococcus magnus from intraabdominal sepsis, nonpuerperal breast abscess, and diabetic foot infections were examined for collagenase activity using bovine type I collagen. Collagenase production was detected in a higher percentage of strains from nonpuerperal breast and diabetic foot specimens (P less than .001). This enzyme may be responsible for P. magnus playing a more central role in the pathogenesis of nonpuerperal breast abscess and diabetic foot disease than in intraabdominal sepsis. 
Sternohyoid muscle biopsy. A diagnostic technique in respiratory failure of neuromuscular origin. Patients with neuromuscular disease may develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. We describe a sternohyoid muscle biopsy technique as a diagnostic aid in such patients undergoing tracheostomy for prolonged ventilatory support. The biopsy procedure is quick and without added discomfort or morbidity for the patient. Our preliminary observations in three patients suggest that the sternohyoid muscle biopsy may be a useful diagnostic tool in this selected group of patients. 
Quantitative coronary arteriographic methods in the interventional catheterization laboratory: an update and perspective. Recent research advances in the area of quantitative coronary arteriography are described with respect to their potential role in assessing the effects of interventional therapy and monitoring the restenosis process. Specific areas emphasized are the importance of quantitative arteriography and absolute measures of arterial dimension in monitoring restenosis, the development of a computerized method for measuring lesion roughness, the potential role of measuring stenosis flow reserve based on component analysis principles, limitations of direct measures of myocardial flow reserve using a digital angiographic method and cautionary notes about clinical applications of videodensitometry. The current use of radiography and quantitative measures in limiting arterial injury are briefly reviewed. Finally, a perspective is put forth on the need to develop complementary roles for endovascular echocardiography and angioscopy with existing radiographic imaging technology. 
Morphometric studies in rectal biopsy specimens from patients with ulcerative colitis: effect of oral 5 amino salicylic acid and rectal prednisolone treatment. Morphometric measurements were performed on rectal biopsy specimens from 10 normal control subjects and 33 patients with a relapse of distal ulcerative colitis before and after treatment for four weeks in a double blind controlled trial with oral eudragit S coated 5 amino salicylic acid (n = 12) or rectal prednisolone enemas (n = 15). Measurements were assessed using a computer aided measuring system and a counting technique. When untreated patients were compared with the control group there were significant decreases in the area and height of the surface epithelium, in the area of crypt epithelium, and in the ratios of goblet cells to epithelial cells and of surface epithelium to lamina propria. The vascular and lamina propria areas and the number of intraepithelial polymorphs were increased. Treatment with 5 amino salicylic acid and corticosteroids resulted in similar morphological improvements: there was an increase in the area and height of the surface epithelium and the ratios of surface epithelium to lamina propria and of surface to crypt cell height. The ratio of goblet cells to epithelial cells also increased after treatment, while the numbers of polymorphs in the surface and crypt epithelium and lumen decreased. In conclusion, computerised morphometry is valuable for the assessment of the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis and that in the doses used both treatments were of similar efficacy. 
Risk of cataract and history of severe diarrheal disease in southern India. A case-control study was carried out in the state of Tamil Nadu, southern India, to examine the association between the risk of visually disabling cataract and a lifetime history of severe diarrhea (including cholera). A series of 421 subjects, aged 35 to 65 years, meeting case (n = 181) and control (n = 240) eligibility criteria were enrolled from 19 rural cataract-screening camps. Ninety case-control pairs were postmatched for (reported) age (+/- 2 years), sex, and area of residence. A history of diarrhea was obtained by using an algorithm developed by other investigators in India who have reported a strong association between cataract and diarrhea. An odds ratio of 0.8 (95% confidence limits: 0.0, 3.2) was obtained from matched pairs analysis, and an odds ratio of 1.3 (95% confidence limit: 0.6, 2.7) was obtained among all subjects (n = 392) from a logistic analysis that adjusted for age, sex, occupation, area of residence, and caste. Findings of this study do not support the hypothesis of an increased risk of visually disabling cataract in persons with a positive history of severe diarrhea. 
Coronary-subclavian steal corrected with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. We describe a case of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. A 58-year-old female who had her first coronary bypass operation 6 years previously and a second operation 3 years previously involving the left internal mammary artery and right gastroepiploic artery, developed unusual angina on effort characterized by left precordial pain, pain in the left shoulder and arm, tinnitus and dizziness. Angiography revealed retrograde flow to the left subclavian artery via the left vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery. Severe stenosis of the left subclavian artery was demonstrated at its ostium. Restoration of antegrade flow to the vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery by transluminal angioplasty resulted in complete resolution of these symptoms. 
Clinical significance of soluble CD30 antigen in the sera of patients with untreated Hodgkin's disease. The soluble form of the CD30 antigen (sCD30), an 88-kd glycoprotein that is released by Hodgkin's-derived cell lines in vitro, can be detected in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, adult (HTLV-1+) T-cell leukemia, rare cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and acute infectious mononucleosis (anti-EBV-IgM+). In a prospective study of 90 consecutive untreated patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease who were treated according to the protocols of the German Hodgkin Study group, 22% had detectable levels of sCD30 in their serum. sCD30 was only detected in patients with B symptoms (20 of 44 or 45%), and maximum sCD30 levels (88 U/mL) were found in stage IVB. Of 87 patients evaluable for response, sCD30+ patients had significantly lower rates of complete remission (9 of 20 or 45% v 60 of 67 or 90%; P less than .001) and higher rates of progressive disease (9 of 20 or 45% v 6 of 67 or 9%; P less than .001) than CD30+ patients. Similarly, freedom from treatment failure curves were significantly worse for CD30+ patients (P = .0003). sCD30 disappeared after successful treatment, but increased in patients with progressive disease. It was never detected in patients in complete remission or in healthy controls. We conclude that sCD30 is a valuable marker for disease activity and has prognostic significance in Hodgkin's disease. 
Basic fibroblast growth factor and somatomedin C in human medulloepithelioma. Two published cases of medulloepithelioma, a rare malignant pediatric brain tumor composed of a mixture of primitive neuroepithelium and its differentiated neuronal and glial descendants, were examined by immunohistochemical staining for the presence of growth factors. From a panel of antibodies, those identifying basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I, formerly known as somatomedin C, were strongly immunoreactive within the neuroepithelial cell population of the tumors. Immunoblots of purified recombinant basic fibroblast growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I showed antibody specificity without cross-reactivity. In controls, immunostaining of tissue sections was abolished by preabsorption of primary antibodies with the appropriate growth factor polypeptide antigen. Preabsorption with inappropriate growth factor did not reduce the intensity or alter the distribution of staining. The congruent histologic patterns of immunoreactivities suggest that more than one type of growth factor may be produced by the neuroepithelial component of medulloepithelioma. These growth factors may stimulate proliferation and differentiation of tumor cells by autocrine molecular mechanisms. 
Menstrual symptoms in women with pelvic endometriosis. OBJECTIVE--To investigate menstrual symptoms in relation to pelvic pathology. DESIGN--A prospective questionnaire-based study. SETTING--Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Scotland. SUBJECTS--1250 questionnaires were sent out prior to planned admission and 1200 women (96%) brought the completed questionnaires. They comprised 598 women undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, 312 having laparoscopy because of infertility, 156 having laparoscopy because of chronic pelvic pain and 134 women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for dysfunctional uterine bleeding. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The occurrence of dysmenorrhoea, menorrhagia, menstrual regularity, premenstrual spotting, deep dyspareunia and pelvic pain in women with either endometriosis and post infective pelvic adhesions or a normal pelvis. RESULTS--Menorrhagia, menstrual irregularity and premenstrual spotting occurred with equal frequency in all groups. Deep dyspareunia, pain after intercourse and recurrent pain unrelated to menstruation or coitus was more common in women with endometriosis and those with post infective pelvic adhesions than in those with a normal pelvis. Dysmenorrhoea appears to be more prevalent among women having endometriosis. CONCLUSIONS--Menstrual symptoms, while raising a high index of suspicion for endometriosis, are not entirely reliable as indicators of disease. Dysmenorrhoea is the most common reported symptom in endometriosis sufferers. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered before institution of treatment in women complaining of pelvic pain and menstrual symptoms. 
Conjunctival necrosis after administration of topical fortified aminoglycosides. We treated 11 episodes of bulbar conjunctival necrosis that occurred in ten patients after therapy for suppurative keratitis with topical fortified aminoglycosides. Chemosis and mucous discharge preceded the development of an area of conjunctival pallor, which stained with fluorescein and was 5 to 10 mm from the corneoscleral limbus. Typical lesions developed in the inferior bulbar conjunctiva after a mean of 4.8 days and 112 mg of gentamicin sulfate (109 drops). The fortified aminoglycoside was the only agent common to all cases. The conjunctival defects healed completely between five and 13 days after treatment was modified to reduce or eliminate aminoglycoside exposure. 
Prediction of death and myocardial infarction by radionuclide angiocardiography in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. The prognostic value of radionuclide angiocardiography was examined in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Nine hundred and eight patients who underwent rest and exercise radionuclide angiocardiography without subsequent cardiac catheterization were followed for a median of 4.6 years. Fifty-two cardiovascular deaths and 28 nonfatal myocardial infarctions occurred during the follow-up period. Thirty-nine radionuclide angiocardiographic and clinical variables were analyzed in association with the end points of cardiovascular death, total cardiac events and death from all causes using the Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Univariable analysis identified the exercise ejection fraction as the best predictor of cardiovascular death (chi-square = 82), total cardiac events (chi-square = 84) and death from all causes (chi-square = 66). A small subset of patients (n = 45) with an exercise ejection fraction less than 0.35 were at high risk for future cardiac events, whereas most patients (n = 776) had an exercise ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 and a low probability of a subsequent event. Three variables--the exercise ejection fraction, the exercise change in heart rate, and gender--contained independent prognostic information determined by multivariable analysis. The exercise ejection fraction was the strongest independent predictor (p less than 0.0001) for every end point. The measurement of ventricular function during exercise provides important independent prognostic information in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Radionuclide angiocardiography successfully identifies patients requiring invasive assessment, and the low probability of cardiac events in patients with good exercise ventricular function obviates the need for interventional therapy. 
Efficacy of feedback training in long-standing facial nerve paresis. An efficacious treatment has not been available to patients with aberrant regeneration of the facial nerve as a result of Bell's palsy or after acoustic neuroma excision. This prospective controlled trial examines the efficacy of electromyographic feedback versus mirror feedback as treatment strategies for patients suffering from long-standing (18 months minimum) facial nerve paresis. Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to electromyography with mirror feedback or mirror feedback alone. Seven rural patients who did not undergo treatment served as controls. At 0, 6, and 12 months, facial motor function was objectively quantified by linear measurement of facial movement, visual assessment of voluntary movement, and electrical measurement of facial nerve response to maximal stimulation. Statistically significant improvements were noted in both electromyography and mirror-feedback groups with respect to symmetry of voluntary movement (P less than .03) and linear measurement of facial expression (P less than .01). The positive results of this controlled trial demonstrate that feedback training in combination with a structured home rehabilitation program is a clinically efficacious treatment for patients with facial nerve paresis. 
Safety and cost effectiveness of combined coronary angiography and angioplasty. If coronary angioplasty can be safely performed at the time of the initial diagnostic catheterization, it may result in shorter hospitalization stays and lower overall costs. Combined coronary angiography and angioplasty was performed electively on 733 patients between January 1, 1984, and September 1, 1988. These patients were divided into three major subgroups based upon their indications for angioplasty: 444 (61%) procedures were performed for restenosis; 190 (26%) procedures were performed in patients for unstable angina; and 99 (13%) procedures were performed in patients without unstable angina or previous angioplasty. A subset of 219 patients from this study who underwent elective combined coronary angiography and angioplasty during 1986 were compared with a matched population of 191 patients from the angiography and angioplasty as separate procedures). The success and complication rates were similar for both of these groups. Patients who underwent the combined procedure were hospitalized for a mean of 4.6 days with average total charges of $11,128, compared with 8.0 days and $13,160 for patients undergoing separate procedures (p less than 0.001). Significant savings were also realized with respect to total contrast dose, fluoroscopic time, and total procedural time. Thus in informed patients with suitable coronary anatomy, the strategy of combined angiography and angioplasty may present an opportunity for decreasing hospitalization stay, reducing total charges for revascularization, and reducing radiation exposure without compromising the safety or effectiveness of the procedure. 
Fibrous dysplasia vs adamantinoma of the tibia: differentiation based on discriminant analysis of clinical and plain film findings. Differentiation between benign fibrous dysplasia and malignant adamantinoma of the tibia is challenging because of the impact the diagnosis has on the choice of treatment (none or extensive surgery). The histologic and pathologic similarities of the lesions and the controversial relationship between fibrous dysplasia, osteofibrous dysplasia, and adamantinoma complicate the matter. We found a large overlap of histologic features in lesions considered either fibrous dysplasia or osteofibrous dysplasia on the basis of the radiologic findings. The purpose of this study was to determine the value of the plain radiograph of the lower leg in combination with clinical findings to differentiate the benign from the malignant condition. The clinical symptoms, radiographs, and histologic slides of 46 patients with fibrous dysplasia and 22 with adamantinoma in the tibia were reviewed retrospectively. In only one of 12 patients with radiologic or histologic characteristics of osteofibrous dysplasia were both radiologic and histologic criteria for the diagnosis present. A linear discriminant analysis was performed on six clinical (age, spontaneous pain, pain after trauma, swelling only, pain and swelling, and bowing deformity) and 25 radiologic signs. Fibrous dysplasia and its variant osteofibrous dysplasia could be identified correctly in 87% (40 of 46 patients) and adamantinoma in 95% (21 of 22 patients) by using the patient's age and four radiologic signs. When results from the discriminant analysis of a randomized subgroup of patients (32) were used on the other subgroup (36 patients), fibrous dysplasia was correctly identified in 84% (21 of 25) and adamantinoma in 82% (nine of 11). Fibrous dysplasia is more prevalent than adamantinoma in a young patient, when radiographs show a ground-glass appearance and anterior bowing and when there is no multilayered periosteal reaction and moth-eaten destruction. When radiologic signs and the patient's age are combined, fibrous dysplasia and adamantinoma can be discriminated in a high percentage of patients. 
Comparison of mastectomy and lumpectomy for medial carcinoma of the breast. The recurrence and five year disease-free survival rates of 86 patients with carcinoma of the breast located in the medial quadrants who had either lumpectomy and radiotherapy or mastectomy were compared. Patients who had lumpectomy and mastectomy were comparable with respect to variables reflecting extent of the disease. One of 54 patients who had lumpectomy had a local recurrence and five had a recurrence regionally or at distant sites. In the group of 32 patients who had a mastectomy, one patient had a local recurrence and an additional four patients had a recurrence at other sites. The five year study disease-free survival rate was 83 per cent for the lumpectomy group and 78 per cent for the mastectomy group. These data suggest that, for medial quadrant lesions, there may be a disease-free survival advantage associated with lumpectomy and radiotherapy over mastectomy. Further study of this treatment modality for this subset of patients seems indicated. 
Cytostatic extravasation. A serious complication of long-term venous access. Totally implantable ports have gained popularity as venous access in the treatment of cancer. A case is reported with an uncommon but very serious complication, i.e., cytostatic extravasation secondary to a broken implanted catheter. Guidelines for implantation and remedies are recommended. 
Prevalence of chronic migraine headaches--United States, 1980-1989. Migraine headaches, which are characterized by painful, disabling, and recurring symptoms, have no known cause, treatment, or cure. Quality population-based data are needed to improve epidemiologic understanding of chronic migraine headaches. This report uses data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to describe the prevalence of recent trends in the occurrence of chronic migraine headaches in the United States from 1980 through 1989. 
Diagnosis and laparoscopic grading of acute salpingitis. Pelvic inflammatory disease continues to be a major cause of morbidity in women of reproductive age. Findings of bilateral adnexal tenderness and signs of a lower genital tract infection (mucopus, or leukorrhea, or both) should prompt clinicians to consider the diagnosis of salpingitis in this group of women. Additional signs of infection, such as elevated temperature, palpable adnexal complex, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or c-reactive protein, and positive tests for either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis will improve the overall specificity of the clinical diagnosis. Endometrial biopsy offers an acceptable approach to documenting objectively inflammation of the upper genital tract. Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered in all patients but may be especially helpful for those patients in whom a diagnosis is unclear. A laparoscopic grading system based primarily on tubal mobility and inflammation can be useful in predicting duration of in-hospital therapy and future tubal factor infertility. 
Economic analyses in hypertension: applications for healthcare providers. Hypertension affects millions of Americans. With healthcare dollars becoming more closely scrutinized, economic studies are playing an important role in helping decision makers choose who should receive treatment and which treatments and methods of administration are most cost-effective. This article provides an overview of the different methods used in economic evaluation and demonstrates the utility of each method using studies from the hypertension literature. 
Transient erythroblastopenia of childhood with CD10, TdT, and cytoplasmic mu lymphocyte positivity in bone marrow. Over three years, three children presented with anaemia, reticulocytopenia, and marrow erythroblastopenia. A pronounced lymphocytosis was also evident in two of the marrow aspirates, with increased numbers of cells bearing the immunophenotype TdT+, CD10+ HLA DR+, and cytoplasmic mu +, and reported to be compatible with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). The clinical course of the illness was fully compatible with transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC), and all three children remained well one to four years after initial presentation. It is concluded that increased numbers of lymphoid cells with a common or pre-B ALL phenotype may be found in bone marrow aspirates of children with TEC, and should not be misdiagnosed as acute leukaemia. 
Zinc in the management of tinnitus. Placebo-controlled trial. To assess any possible beneficial effect from zinc on tinnitus we performed a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind investigation. Forty-eight patients with tinnitus were randomized to either placebo or the administration of zinc sulfate as sustained-release tablets of 22 mg Zn++ (Zinklet). The tablets were administered three times daily for 8 weeks. Every week the patients stated the severity of tinnitus on a number scale from 0 to 10. The levels of zinc and albumin in serum were determined both before and after treatment. Of 48 patients with tinnitus, hypozincemia was found in only one patient. The zinc level increased significantly in the patients treated with zinc. We could not demonstrate any beneficial effect from zinc on tinnitus. One of the essential reasons for this finding could be that the zinc levels in serum were in the normal range previous to treatment. 
In situ fresh allograft replacement of an infected aortic prosthetic graft: eighteen months' follow-up. We report a case in which an allogenic aortic graft was used to treat the last one of a series of infectious graft complications. The original operation was a Dacron aortobifemoral bypass for aortoiliac occlusive disease in an institution other than ours. The patient was referred for the treatment of the infection of the prosthetic implant. We inserted a prosthetic bypass from the left axillary to the left deep femoral artery, as well as a crossover autogenous saphenous vein graft from the prosthesis to the right deep femoral artery; in the same operation the infected intraabdominal prosthesis was removed with closure of the proximal aortic stump. Subsequent stenosis of the vein graft made it necessary to insert a prosthetic bypass between the descending thoracic aorta and the two deep femoral arteries. Infection of the last named prosthesis made it necessary to remove it and replace it with a tailored allogenic arterial allograft between the infrarenal abdominal aorta and both deep femoral arteries. The patient had an uneventful recovery as the infection was controlled and both lower limbs were salvaged. Eighteen months later the allograft was patent without any signs of degeneration. Further clinical experience under appropriate conditions may prove the use of allografts effective in the treatment of selected cases of aortic prosthetic infection. 
Low-energy catheter electrical ablation for sustained ventricular tachycardia. Catheter electrical ablation using a relatively low level of energy--40 to 100 joules--was attempted in 12 consecutive patients with drug-refractory sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT). They had 19 monomorphic VTs, and ischemic heart disease was found as the underlying heart disease in one, nonischemic heart disease was found in nine, and no structural heart disease was seen in two patients. Electrical discharge was delivered at the site of the earliest endocardial activation in 17 VTs, and at the slow conduction area in two VTs. Among 19 VTs in 12 patients, 12 VTs (63%) in seven patients (58%) were successfully ablated and became noninducible during electrophysiologic study. There were no major complications, but transient atrioventricular block occurred in one patient and transient friction rub occurred in another. Delivered electrical energy and the time interval between the local electrogram and the surface QRS did not correlate with the clinical outcome of the procedure. However, "excellent" pace-mapped QRS morphology was obtained from the site of earliest activation or from the slow conduction area in 9 of 12 VTs in the successful cases but in only one of seven VTs in the unsuccessful cases. Low-energy catheter electrical ablation seems to be a satisfactory therapeutic procedure compared with the conventional method that uses an energy level of 200 joules or higher. 
Stereotactic management of colloid cysts: factors predicting success. Stereotactic aspiration is a valuable surgical alternative for colloid cysts when used alone or in conjunction with microsurgical resection. Since 1981, the authors have performed computerized tomography (CT)-guided stereotactic aspiration as the initial procedure in 22 patients with colloid cysts; stereotactic aspiration alone was successful in 11 patients (50%). Of the 11 patients in whom aspiration failed, stereotactic endoscopic resection was attempted in three and was successful in one. Seven patients required a craniotomy and microsurgical removal of the cyst performed via a transcortical approach. The preoperative CT appearance in eight cases of a hypodense or isodense cyst correlated favorably with successful aspiration of the cyst in six patients. A hyperdense appearance on the preoperative CT scan in 14 cases was associated with subtotal aspiration in 13 patients; five required craniotomy for removal. Preoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in eight patients provided excellent anatomical definition of the cyst and its relationship to other structures of the third ventricle, but it was not possible to correlate successful aspiration with cyst appearance on MR images with short or long relaxation time sequences. The authors' 9-year experience suggests that preoperative CT studies accurately determine size, predict viscosity, and help to define a group of colloid cyst patients for whom stereotactic cyst aspiration will likely be successful. Unsuccessful stereotactic aspiration was related to two features: the high viscosity of the intracystic colloid material (nine patients), or deviation of the cyst away from the aspiration needle due to small cyst volume (two patients). Because of its simplicity and low risk, stereotactic surgery can be offered to selected patients as the initial procedure of choice. Craniotomy can be reserved for those whose imaging studies predict failure or for those whose cyst cannot be aspirated. 
A therapeutic dilemma: suppressive doses of thyroxine significantly reduce bone mineral measurements in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with thyroid carcinoma. We measured lumbar spine, femoral neck, and forearm bone mineral (BMD) in 24 women (14 premenopausal and 10 postmenopausal) who had been treated with total thyroidectomy and 131 Iodine ablation therapy for nonanaplastic thyroid carcinoma and 24 case controls. At the time of the study, all patients were free of cancer (negative 131 Iodine whole body scan and serum thyroglobulin levels less than 0.3 micrograms/L) and all were receiving doses of T4 sufficiently high to prevent a rise in a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration after an iv bolus of TRH. Femoral neck BMD were significantly reduced in both the premenopausal women (89 +/- 3.8% of case controls, 95% CI, 81 to 98) and postmenopausal women (77 +/- 3.9% of case controls; 95% CI, 68 to 86) receiving T4. Lumbar spine BMD and forearm BMD were unaffected in the premenopausal women, but significantly reduced in the postmenopausal women receiving T4 (lumbar spine BMD = 84 +/- 6.2% of case controls; 95% CI, 70 to 98 and forearm BMD = 89 +/- 5.6% of case controls; 95% CI, 76 to 101). Serum bone Gla-protein, a marker of bone turnover, was significantly increased in both the premenopausal and the postmenopausal women receiving T4 compared to case controls (P less than 0.001 for the difference between patient groups and controls). Whereas the cumulative dose of T4 was highly correlated with the femoral neck BMD in the premenopausal patients (r = 0.528; P less than 0.05); the presence of hypogonadism was the main determinant of the lumbar spine and forearm BMD. This data confirms that premenopausal and postmenopausal women receiving suppressive doses of T4 for thyroid carcinoma have diminished bone mineral measurements and are at risk for osteoporosis. 
Myocardial oedema and ventricular function after cardioplegia with added mannitol. Myocardial oedema may contribute to the impaired myocardial performance which commonly follows open heart surgery with cardioplegia-induced cardiac arrest. The rate of oedema formation during crystalloid cardioplegia and the relation of this to changes in ventricular compliance and ventricular function following reperfusion were studied using an isolated rabbit heart preparation. Myocardial tissue water content increased during cardioplegic arrest and the water content prior to reperfusion demonstrated an inverse correlation with ventricular function after reperfusion. In further studies the effect of adding mannitol to a standard crystalloid cardioplegic solution was investigated. The preparations were divided into two groups: nine were administered a standard cardioplegic solution (Plegisol*) (control group) and a further eight were administered the same solution mixed with mannitol to adjust the osmotic pressure to 360 mOsmol.L-3 (mannitol group). The mannitol group demonstrated less increase in RV water content and superior LV dP/dtmax following reperfusion. It is concluded that mannitol enhances protection of the myocardium during cardioplegic cardiac arrest. 
Histopathologic comparison between human oral squamous cell carcinomas and their xenografts in nude mice. Tumor portions were obtained from 11 oral squamous cell carcinomas and used to produce tumors in a xenogeneic gnotobiotic nude mouse model system. The tumors that developed were examined histologically. The cellular features and tumor growth patterns were compared between the original oral squamous cell carcinoma (T0) and the tumor that developed in the xenogeneic host (T1). The T1 tumors were more highly differentiated in comparison with the T0 tumors. The T1 tumors exhibited less cellular pleomorphism and a more uniform pattern of stratification. The cells in the T1 tumors exhibited an increased mitotic index but did not contain abnormal mitoses. The T1 tumors usually exhibited nodular growth patterns rather than the infiltrating pattern exhibited by the parenchyma of the T0 tumors. The desmoplastic reaction was markedly reduced in the T1 tumors. The results indicated that the gnotobiotic nude mouse model system either selects for or induces a more differentiated pattern of tumor growth than that found in the original human oral squamous cell carcinomas. 
Acute allergic interstitial pneumonitis induced by hydrochlorothiazide [published erratum appears in Can Med Assoc J 1991 Sep 1;145(5):391] OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical features of 4 unpublished cases and 26 published cases of acute allergic interstitial pneumonitis induced by hydrochlorothiazide (HCT). DATA SOURCES: The unpublished cases were found in the database of the Drug Adverse Reaction Program, Health Protection Branch, Department of National Health and Welfare, and the database of the Programme conjoint de pharmacovigilance, in Quebec. The published cases were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE. STUDY SELECTION: Reported cases were selected if they were sufficiently documented. All published cases were selected because a differential diagnosis had been made in each one. DATA SYNTHESIS: The onset was acute and dramatic; the average time to onset of symptoms was 44 minutes. Sex was a predominant risk factor, since 27 (90%) of the 30 patients were women. The average age was 56 years; thus, most of the women were postmenopausal. Over two-thirds of the patients had one to three positive prechallenges or rechallenges, 3 of the 52 documented adverse events occurred after a voluntary rechallenge, some were life-threatening and necessitated mechanical ventilation, and 1 was fatal. Treatment was supportive; avoidance of HCT was the only prevention. CONCLUSION: Acute allergic interstitial pneumonitis due to HCT is extremely rare and potentially fatal. Such a reaction can be diagnosed only if the clinician suspects it when presented with a case of unexplained acute pulmonary edema. 
Deglutition syncope with coexistent carotid sinus hypersensitivity. A 63-year-old man had symptomatic deglutition-induced atrioventricular (A-V) block. There was also a coexistent mixed type carotid sinus hypersensitivity presenting as A-V block. No A-V nodal dysfunction was revealed during electrophysiologic studies. The vasodepressor response to carotid massage implies a central vagal hyperresponsiveness, which can also explain the cardioinhibitory responses to swallowing and carotid sinus massage, both possibly unmasked by posterior myocardial infarction. 
Opposing actions of dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone on insulin sensitivity. In vivo and in vitro studies of hyperandrogenic females. It has been hypothesized that the androgens testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may have opposing actions on insulin sensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we selected patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCO) and hypertestosteronemia and a group of individuals with adrenal hyperplasia (AH) and elevated DHEA and studied their 1) insulin and glucose responses to a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, 2) insulin resistance by hypoglycemic responses to a standard dose of intravenous (IV) insulin, and 3) insulin binding and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) responsiveness to insulin in phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-activated T lymphocytes. PCO patients exhibited elevated basal and glucose-challenged insulin levels and had blunted hypoglycemic responses to IV insulin. Conversely, AH patients had hypoglycemic responses to IV insulin significantly greater than and basal and glucose-challenged insulin levels lower than the PCO patients and weight-matched control subjects. In vitro, T-lymphocyte insulin binding of the PCO patients was 40-60% below control values; in AH patients, insulin binding and PDH insulin sensitivity were above those of the control subjects. Testosterone levels in all study subjects were negatively correlated to T-lymphocyte insulin binding and positively correlated to basal insulin, insulin area under the curve (AUC), and insulin-glucose indices. DHEA levels were positively correlated to insulin binding and inversely related to basal insulin, insulin AUC, and insulin-glucose indices. In all instances, the parameters of insulin sensitivity were more strongly correlated to individuals' ratios of DHEA to testosterone than to either of these androgens alone. 
Fluid collections developing after pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation and intervention. The usefulness of real-time sonography, duplex sonography, computed tomography (CT), cystography, diagnostic aspiration, and percutaneous drainage in the diagnosis and treatment of peri-pancreatic-transplant fluid collections was retrospectively assessed in 46 recipients of extraperitoneal pancreatic transplants. Forty-four abnormalities were identified in the extraperitoneal space at sonography, including four pancreatic pseudocysts associated with malfunction of the pancreatic duct, seven abscesses, six hematomas, nine urinomas, six early postoperative fluid collections that spontaneously resolved, six cases of pancreatitis, and six cases of vascular occlusion. Sonography (including pulsed Doppler sonography) was the procedure of choice in detecting fluid collections and diagnosing pancreatitis, rejection, vascular thrombosis, and pancreatic duct malfunction. CT was diagnostic in four of six hematomas; cystography was diagnostic in seven of nine urinomas. Sonographically guided percutaneous intervention enabled three patients to avoid surgery and allowed optimal surgical planning for six patients. 
Failure of right-sided coloanal anastomosis for treatment of left-sided ulcerative colitis. Report of a case. A patient with ulcerative colitis limited to the rectum and distal colon underwent a left hemicolectomy, a mucosal proctectomy, and a coloanal sleeve anastomosis using the normal proximal colon. She experienced macroscopic recurrence of her disease within 2 months of the operation and eventually required excision of the remaining colon and an end ileostomy. Our experience and that of others would indicate that a right-sided coloanal operation is unsuitable for the treatment of left-sided ulcerative colitis. 
Reactive occipital epileptiform activity: is it benign? Occipital epileptiform activity that is almost continuous and reactive to eye opening has been associated with a childhood epilepsy syndrome and basilar migraine with seizures. An association of these syndromes with a benign course had been disputed. In this study, a retrospective investigation of reactive occipital epileptiform activity (ROEA) was performed to determine the prognostic value of this distinctive EGG pattern. The EEG and hospital record of patients with ROEA were reviewed with an observation period of 6 months to 8 years. The patients were divided into good and poor outcome groups based on response to treatment. Of 33 patients, 12 (36.4%) had complete seizure control; 21 (63.6%) continued to have poorly controlled seizures. Only 3 (9.1%) patients were able to discontinue antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) without seizure recurrence. Analysis of clinical and EEG variables showed that a history of perinatal difficulties, abnormal neurologic findings, and abnormal EEG background activities occur significantly more frequently in the poor outcome group. This study suggests that ROEA is not uniformly associated with a benign course and that other factors are involved in determining prognosis of the epilepsy. 
Methanol poisoning. A rodent model with structural and functional evidence for retinal involvement. Methanol ingestion can lead to visual impairment, central nervous system dysfunction, or death. The extent of ocular involvement has been difficult to determine because the toxicity is restricted to humans and nonhuman primates due to species differences in methanol metabolism. A rodent model of methanol toxicity recently developed by us was used to evaluate retinal dysfunction in methanol poisoning. Formic acidemia and visual toxic reactions developed in methanol-intoxicated rats. Electroretinographic analysis indicated a significant early deficit in b-wave amplitude followed by a temporally delayed, lesser reduction in a-wave amplitude. Histologic evaluation of the eyes 60 hours after methanol administration revealed generalized retinal edema and vacuolation in the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium. Ultrastructural examination showed swelling and disruption of the mitochondria in photoreceptor inner segments, optic nerve, and the retinal pigment epithelium. These studies document direct retinal involvement in this nonprimate model of methanol toxicity. 
Otorhinolaryngologic causes of headache. Pain around the face and neck is common. This pain may be referred from a different area. Because patients usually present with pain and discomfort in a specific location such as the ear, nose, face, throat, or neck, this article discusses separately the innervation of each region and the most frequent causes of pain in each of these areas. 
Dopa-responsive dystonia: long-term treatment response and prognosis. We report observations on the treatment of 66 patients with presumed dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD). Forty-seven of these patients had hereditary disease; 19 had disease of sporadic occurrence. Initial diagnostic confusion with "cerebral palsy" or "spastic diplegia" existed in 16 patients. Several patients benefited from anticholinergic medications and a few from carbamazepine. Levodopa was the most effective treatment in all cases. In the majority, there was an excellent response, with continued long-term clinical stability on levodopa therapy for as long as 10 to 22 years. Four men with sporadic disease and 1 woman with a sister affected with adolescent-onset parkinsonism had similar initial treatment response, but developed "wearing-off" and a less satisfactory response to levodopa within the first few years of treatment. This indicates that some patients with clinical syndromes suggestive of DRD may not have an excellent prognosis on long-term levodopa treatment and may represent misclassified cases of childhood-onset parkinsonism. 
Characterization of estrogen receptor in human gastric cancer. Estrogen receptors (ER) were examined in cytosol, nuclear potassium chloride (KCl) extractable fraction, and nuclear KCl unextractable fraction by the dextran-coated charcoal adsorption method in various gastric cancer tissue. The overall ER-positive rate in the cytosol and nuclear fraction was 19.2%. The maximum binding site (Bmax) was 36.0 to 175.0 fmol/mg of protein, and the dissociation constant (Kd) was 0.6 to 1.6 X 10(-9) in cytosol fraction. In the nuclear fraction, Bmax was 7.5 fmol/mg of DNA and Kd was 2.3 X 10(-9). Estrogen receptors were characterized in cytosol protein. In cytosol, the estrogen (E2)-ER complex was sedimented at approximately the 5S and 8S regions by 5% to 20% linear sucrose gradient centrifugation. A steroid specificity study of ER showed the presence of an binder in gastric cancer tissue. In conclusion, these results that gastric cancer tissue has E2 binding sites with the same biochemical characteristics as in breast cancer and endometrial cancer strongly suggest the hormonal dependency of gastric cancer. 
Anorectal varices--their frequency in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic portal hypertension. Anorectal varices in portal hypertension have been little studied: Seventy eight per cent of 72 patients with portal hypertension had anorectal varices shown at flexible sigmoidoscopy. Significantly more patients with noncirrhotic portal hypertension had these varices than patients with cirrhosis (89% v 56%, p less than 0.01). 
Jejunal biopsy in HIV-infected patients. Forty-nine HIV-infected patients were submitted to peroral jejunal biopsy in order to evaluate the presence of microorganisms and the histomorphometric aspects of the enteric mucosa with subsequent correlation of these findings to the appropriate clinical stage of the disease. Thirty-seven patients fulfilled the CDC criteria for AIDS, of whom 23 presented with diarrhea. Of the 12 patients who had not yet been given an AIDS diagnosis. 3 had persistent generalized lymphadenopathy and 9 were asymptomatic carriers. Flat mucosa was observed in two patients (8.7%) with diarrhea and coccidea. Subtotal villous atrophy and severe lamina propria (LP) mononuclear infiltrate (13%) were found only in patients with diarrhea. Moderate to severe histologic changes were more frequently observed in this group, not always related to the presence of microorganisms. Crypt hyperregeneration was a constant finding. Intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) count was decreased in patients with diarrhea. Specific infectious agents were unexpectedly rare for the tropical developing country population studied. The organism most commonly associated with diarrhea was Cryptosporidium sp. (21.7%). The etiology of diarrhea in a significant number of patients remains unclear. 
Surgical management of retinal detachment associated with the acute retinal necrosis syndrome. We operated on nine eyes in eight patients with retinal detachment associated with acute retinal necrosis (ARN) syndrome. The patients were treated with scleral buckling, vitreoretinal surgery, or a combination of these treatments. Vitrectomised eyes underwent combinations of lensectomy, membrane dissection, scleral buckling, air-fluid exchange, endolaser photocoagulation, cryotherapy, and retinal tamponade with C3F8 gas or SF6 gas. Macular attachment was achieved in eight (89%) eyes. Vision improved in seven (78%) eyes, of which five (56%) achieved 20/200 or better vision. Three eyes that had received laser treatment posterior to areas of retinitis suffered retinal detachment despite this prophylactic treatment. Poor visual outcome resulted from viral infection of the optic nerve or macular involvement, macular hole formation, macular pucker, or hypotony. 
Differences in the use of procedures between women and men hospitalized for coronary heart disease BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Previous studies at individual hospitals have reported differences in the use of major diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for women and men with coronary heart disease. To assess whether these differences can be generalized, we performed retrospective analyses of coronary angiography and revascularization (coronary-artery bypass surgery or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) in women and men hospitalized for coronary heart disease in 1987, using abstract data on 49,623 discharges in Massachusetts and 33,159 discharges in Maryland. We used multiple logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds of the use of a procedure, controlling for principal diagnosis, age, secondary diagnosis of congestive heart failure or diabetes mellitus, race, and insurance status. RESULTS. The adjusted odds of undergoing angiography were 28 percent and 15 percent higher for men than for women in Massachusetts and Maryland, respectively (95 percent confidence intervals for the odds ratios, 1.22 to 1.35 and 1.08 to 1.22). The respective adjusted odds of undergoing revascularization were 45 percent and 27 percent higher for men than for women (95 percent confidence intervals, 1.35 to 1.55 and 1.16 to 1.40). Because these differences could be related to differing thresholds for hospital admission, we performed a second analysis limited to patients with diagnosed acute myocardial infarction (11,865 discharges in Massachusetts and 6894 discharges in Maryland), a group in which all patients would be expected to receive hospital care. The male-to-female odds ratios in both states remained similar in magnitude and were statistically significant for angiography and revascularization. CONCLUSIONS. These findings demonstrate that women who are hospitalized for coronary heart disease undergo fewer major diagnostic and therapeutic procedures than men. These differences may represent appropriate levels of care for men and women, but it is also possible that they reflect underuse in women or overuse in men. Further study should assess the cause of these differences and their effect on patients' outcomes. 
Anterolateral transthoracic transvertebral resection of an intramedullary spinal arteriovenous malformation. Case report. The case is reported of a 16-year-old girl with an anterior thoracic spinal cord arteriovenous malformation (AVM) who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage and sudden change in lower-extremity strength. Spinal angiography revealed a Type II (glomus) intramedullary AVM at the T7-8 level fed by multiple branches of the anterior spinal artery. The AVM was successfully resected using an anterolateral transthoracic approach. The details of this approach and its use for surgery of anterior thoracic spine lesions are described. 
Fucosyltransferases: differential plasma and tissue alterations in hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. To determine whether abnormal metabolism of L-fucose in hepatocellular carcinoma is accompanied by alterations in the activities of fucosyltransferases, the latter were determined in plasma and liver tissue of patients with this disease and in cirrhotic and normal subjects. Activities of alpha-2/alpha-3 and alpha-6-L-fucosyltransferases were all significantly greater in plasma from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma than in plasma from cirrhotic patients or normal subjects (p less than 0.025). The activity of each enzyme was dependent, to a similar extent, on Mn2+, Mg2+ and triton X-10, irrespective of the source, and all displayed pH optimums in the range of 7.5 to 8.0. In contrast, activities of alpha-2/alpha-3 fucosyltransferases were significantly lower (p less than 0.025) in homogenates prepared from tumorous liver tissue than in that prepared from nontumorous tissue from hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic patients, whereas for the alpha-6 enzyme the situation was reversed (typically, tumor tissue levels were 5 pmol/hr/mg; in nontumor tissue they were 2 pmol/hr/mg). Activities of galactosyl and mannosyltransferase in tumor tissue were greater in all cases than in nontumor cirrhotic tissue. Plasma fucosyltransferases are specifically elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma but different mechanisms appear to underlie the changes seen for alpha-2/alpha-3 and alpha-6-L-fucosyltransferases. 
Role of bile acids in splanchnic hemodynamic response to chronic portal hypertension. Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that humoral factors, namely glucagon, can account for approximately 30% of the splanchnic vasodilation in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension. A reduced vascular sensitivity to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II may contribute to the splanchnic vasodilation. However, neither glucagon nor an altered vasoconstrictor sensitivity can fully account for the splanchnic vasodilation observed in portal hypertensive subjects. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the role of bile acids in the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension since (1) serum bile acids are elevated in portal hypertensive subjects and (2) bile acids are potent intestinal vasodilators. Prehepatic portal hypertension was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by surgical constriction of the portal vein. Ten to 14 days after the induction of portal hypertension, the enterohepatic circulation of control and portal hypertensive rats was surgically interrupted. The animals were placed in Bollman restraint cages and allowed to recover. Eighteen to 24 hr later, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and regional blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Normal and portal hypertensive animals without bile fistula served as controls. Plasma bile acid levels measured by radioimmunoassay were approximately 3.8 times higher in portal hypertensive animals than in control. Bile duct cannulation effectively depleted both normal and portal hypertensive animals of their circulating bile acid pool and significantly reduced portal venous inflow in portal hypertensive but not in control rats. A role for bile acids as partial mediators of the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension is suggested since bile acid depletion did not completely abolish the gastrointestinal hyperemia. 
Psychiatric aspects of chest pain in the emergency department. We estimate that a third of the patients who present to the ED with chest pain have a current psychiatric disorder and that psychiatric disorders among chest pain patients are associated with a high rate of ED utilization for chest pain evaluations. Physicians in the ED recognize only a small fraction of the psychiatric disorders, so appropriate treatment or referral may be infrequent. The proportion of chest pain patients with CAD who also have a psychiatric disorder may be in the range of 20% to 30%, justifying careful assessment of psychiatric disorders in CAD patients. We conclude that the psychiatric aspects of chest pain are sufficiently prevalent, clinically significant, and a contributor to unnecessarily high utilization of medical services. We call for clinical research to address these questions by outlining three areas of study that will advance our knowledge and care of the patient with chest pain. 
A prospective evaluation of intracoronary ethanol ablation of the atrioventricular conduction system. The clinical efficacy and complications associated with ablation of the atrioventricular (AV) conduction system by the selective infusion of ethanol into the AV node artery were prospectively assessed in 12 consecutive patients with medically refractory atrial arrhythmias. Six of the patients had previously failed to have permanent complete AV block created with direct current or radiofrequency catheter ablation. The AV node artery was cannulated with a 0.016 in. (0.041 cm) guide wire in all 12 patients. It was also possible to advance a 2.7F infusion catheter into the AV node artery in all patients. Transient AV block was induced by selective injections into the AV node artery of iced saline solution (8 patients) and of radiographic contrast agent (ioxaglate) (10 patients). The infusion of 2 ml of ethanol (96%) induced immediate complete AV block in all 10 patients who demonstrated AV block with ioxaglate. The escape rhythm exhibited a narrow QRS complex preceded by a His bundle deflection in nine patients and left bundle branch block in one patient. The immediate mean rate of the escape rhythm was 45.3 +/- 13.4 beats/min. In two patients who demonstrated reflux of contrast agent into the distal right coronary artery with selective injections into the AV node artery, transient ST segment elevation developed in the inferior electrocardiographic leads with the infusion of ethanol. There was no change in the left ventricular ejection fraction from the baseline value (0.53 +/- 0.12) to that measured after ablation (0.55 +/- 0.11) and no patient developed wall motion abnormalities. 
A carbon fiber implant to aid interbody lumbar fusion. Mechanical testing. A carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer implant has been designed to aid interbody lumbar fusion. The cage-like implant has ridges or teeth to resist pullout or retropulsion, struts to support weight bearing, and a hollow center for packing of autologous bone graft. Because carbon is radiolucent, bony healing can be imaged by standard radiographic techniques. The device has been mechanically tested in cadaver spines and compared with posterior lumbar interbody fusion performed with donor bone. The carbon device required a pullout force of 353 N compared with 126 N for donor bone. In compression testing, posterior lumbar interbody fusion performed with the carbon device bore a load of 5,288 N before failure of the vertebral bone. Posterior lumbar interbody fusion performed with donor bone failed at 4,628 N, and unmodified motion segments failed at 6,043 N. The carbon fiber implant separates the mechanical and biologic functions of posterior lumbar interbody fusion. 
The effects of adenotonsillectomy on growth in young children. A history of poor weight gain can often be elicited in young children with chronic upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. A series of 41 consecutive children under 3 years of age, who underwent inpatient adenotonsillectomy, were reviewed for changes in weight and height. Thirty-seven patients had adequate long-term follow-up. Of these, many had dramatic improvements in growth after adenotonsillectomy. Indications for surgery in this group were recurrent infection in three patients (7%), unilateral tonsillar mass in one patient (3%), and upper airway obstruction in 37 patients (90%). A clear history of sleep apnea was elicited in 59%. At the time of surgery, 19 of 41 patients (46%) were of the fifth percentile or lower for age-corrected weight. The inpatient hospital stay averaged 3.2 days. The postoperative complication rate was 27%, with postoperative stridor as the most common complication. After surgery, 28 children (75%) showed a change to a higher percentile for weight. Twenty-four (65%) had percentile changes of 15% or more. This change is significant according to results of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p less than 0.001). We conclude that a relationship exists between improved growth rate and adenotonsillectomy in our study group. The rapid improvement in growth appears to be most obvious in children with upper airway obstruction resulting from adenotonsillar hypertrophy. Upper airway obstruction (including andenotonsillar hypertrophy) should be suspected as a possible cause in the workup of children with suboptimum growth. 
Emergency laryngectomy. From 1974 to 1990, 31 patients underwent emergency laryngectomy for airway obstruction due to laryngeal carcinoma, in an effort to avoid the complication of stomal recurrence. This group of patients had a greater proportion of multiregional tumours (35 per cent vs 13 per cent) than a comparison group of elective laryngectomies. In other respects the two groups were similar. Early post-operative mortality (6.5 per cent vs 3 per cent), stomal recurrence rates (4.2 per cent vs 4.8 per cent) and survival (53 per cent vs 55 per cent) were not significantly different between the emergency laryngectomy group and the comparison group undergoing elective laryngectomy. 
Evaluating quality, cost-effective health care. Vascular database predicated on hospital discharge abstracts. This population-based study examines all carotid endarterectomies (CE) performed by all surgeons in a single state over a 10-year period. The methodology is designed to determine morbidity rate, mortality rate, cost, and length of stay, as well as to understand the effect of pre-existing chronic disease, physician, and hospital volume on these outcome variables. The data source consisted of hospital discharge abstract data uniformly collected on all admissions (N = 5.9 million) to acute care hospitals in the state. In the decade 1979 to 1988, 11,199 patients underwent CE. Mortality rate from CE was 2.1%, and the postoperative stroke rate was 3.7% over this period. High physician volume decreased the mortality rate (p less than 0.05) and stroke rate (p less than 0.01) by 50% and significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced hospital cost and length of stay independent of patient complexity. Examination of cost data, adjusted for inflation, showed a decrease in mean cost for CE over the decade. Thus physicians are providing better care for less hospital dollars. Both patient and payor outcome is improved by concentrating CE patients in the hands of high-volume surgeons. Although the data suggests this trend is already evolving, the pace of this evolution can be expected to increase as payors recognize that regionalization of this procedure lowers costs. 
Necrotizing tracheitis caused by Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum: unique case and review. The occasional pathogenicity of nondiphtheria corynebacteria in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals is now well established. Previously described sites of infection include heart valves, wounds, urinary tract, and lungs. This report of necrotizing tracheitis caused by Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum illustrates the widening spectrum of infections caused by these organisms. A 54-year-old man developed respiratory distress and symptoms of upper airway obstruction unresponsive to inhaled bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, or intravenous erythromycin. A spirometry flow-volume loop demonstrated fixed upper airway obstruction. Fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination revealed a circumferential inflammatory process partially occluding the tracheal lumen. Gram staining revealed gram-positive rods typical of corynebacteria, and cultures of tracheal tissue yielded C. pseudodiphtheriticum resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. There was no clinical or laboratory evidence for exotoxin or cell-associated toxins. Treatment with intravenous penicillin resulted in resolution of the inflammatory process and eradication of the organisms, as assessed by subsequent cultures. 
Role of bile acids in splanchnic hemodynamic response to chronic portal hypertension. Previous studies from our laboratory suggest that humoral factors, namely glucagon, can account for approximately 30% of the splanchnic vasodilation in rats with prehepatic portal hypertension. A reduced vascular sensitivity to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and angiotensin II may contribute to the splanchnic vasodilation. However, neither glucagon nor an altered vasoconstrictor sensitivity can fully account for the splanchnic vasodilation observed in portal hypertensive subjects. Therefore, the present study was designed to examine the role of bile acids in the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension since (1) serum bile acids are elevated in portal hypertensive subjects and (2) bile acids are potent intestinal vasodilators. Prehepatic portal hypertension was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by surgical constriction of the portal vein. Ten to 14 days after the induction of portal hypertension, the enterohepatic circulation of control and portal hypertensive rats was surgically interrupted. The animals were placed in Bollman restraint cages and allowed to recover. Eighteen to 24 hr later, the rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and regional blood flow measured with radiolabeled microspheres. Normal and portal hypertensive animals without bile fistula served as controls. Plasma bile acid levels measured by radioimmunoassay were approximately 3.8 times higher in portal hypertensive animals than in control. Bile duct cannulation effectively depleted both normal and portal hypertensive animals of their circulating bile acid pool and significantly reduced portal venous inflow in portal hypertensive but not in control rats. A role for bile acids as partial mediators of the splanchnic hyperemia of portal hypertension is suggested since bile acid depletion did not completely abolish the gastrointestinal hyperemia. 
Same-day angioplasty and diagnostic catheterization: safe and effective but riskier in unstable angina. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty was performed at the time of the diagnostic catheterization in 188 patients (215 lesions) at a University Hospital in order to assess the efficacy of this approach and the potential role it should play in the evaluation and treatment of patients. Patients either presented for diagnostic catheterization for evaluation of stable coronary disease (79 patients) or for unstable or new onset anginal symptoms (109 patients). Lesions were graded as to whether they were simple or complex; and post angioplasty films were reviewed for success rate, and degree of revascularization. Patients who were referred for stable anginal symptoms had a slightly higher success rate (91%) compared to those who were referred for new onset or more unstable symptomatology (85%, p = ns). Additionally, lesions morphology was judged to be more complex in unstable patients, as 67% had complex lesions with the presence of thrombus or ulcerated plaque in 56% of these stenoses. Angioplasty success was high for simple lesions in all patients, but was most unfavorable for complex stenoses in patients who presented with unstable symptoms (81% success rate). In patients who presented with new onset or unstable symptoms multivessel disease was present in 69% and angioplasty was more often geared at dilating a culprit stenosis leaving only 49% of these patients with complete revascularization. On the other hand, in 76% of those patients who presented with stable angina complete revascularization was a common outcome. Length of hospital stay was considerably shorter at 2.9 +/- 0.8 days in those patients who presented with stable symptoms. 
Neurohumoral activation in congestive heart failure. This article reviews the evidence that congestive heart failure is accompanied by an increased plasma norepinephrine concentration and that this is due not only to a reduced tissue clearance of the substance but also to a marked increase in sympathetic nerve activity. It also reports data that indicate that the sympathetic activation is associated with an activation of the renin-angiotensin system and an increased plasma level of vasopressin. At which degree of congestive heart failure these phenomena become manifest is not clear, but some studies suggest that the sympathetic and renin-angiotensin systems may be normal in asymptomatic congestive heart failure but already somewhat activated when this condition reaches New York Heart Association class II. There is also evidence that this activation, though initially compensatory, is eventually responsible for a number of adverse cardiovascular effects that account for the negative relationship between this event and survival. Finally, the article discusses the inability of the increased plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide that characterizes congestive heart failure to offset the adverse effects of the neurohumoral activation and the variable influence of drug treatment on this phenomenon. This is not impossible to achieve, however, because heart transplantation appears to rapidly normalize a major factor in the increased sympathetic activity observed before surgical intervention, that is, impairment of the arterial baroreflex. 
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study design and baseline patient characteristics. ETDRS report number 7. The Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS), a multicenter collaborative clinical trial supported by the National Eye Institute, was designed to assess whether argon laser photocoagulation or aspirin treatment can reduce the risk of visual loss or slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy in patients with mild-to-severe nonproliferative or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The 3711 patients enrolled in the ETDRS were assigned randomly to either aspirin (650 mg per day) or placebo. One eye of each patient was assigned randomly to early argon laser photocoagulation and the other to deferral of photocoagulation. Both eyes were to be examined at least every 4 months and photocoagulation was to be initiated in eyes assigned to deferral as soon as high-risk proliferative retinopathy was detected. Examination of a large number of baseline ocular and patient characteristics indicated that there were no important differences between randomized treatment groups at baseline. 
Clinical efficacy of sucralfate in the treatment of gastric ulcer. We performed a randomized, single-blind study in Japan to investigate the efficacy and safety of two dosage regimens of sucralfate granules, 2 g, twice daily (b.i.d. group, n = 30) and 1 g, 4 times daily (q.i.d. group, n = 27), on ulcer healing in 57 patients with endoscopically proven gastric ulcer. Endoscopy was performed after 4 weeks and, if complete healing was not achieved, again after an additional 4 weeks. Of 57 patients, 11 were excluded from the statistical analysis because of protocol violation (six in b.i.d. group, five in q.i.d. group). Of 46 patients eligible for the analysis of healing rates, four patients in the b.i.d. group (all at 8 weeks) and five patients in the q.i.d. group (two at 4 weeks and three at 8 weeks) were withdrawn due to patients' inconvenience. As the possibility that the withdrawals were due to the treatment failures could not be denied, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and generalized Wilcoxon test/logrank test for the calculation and evaluation of healing rates in this study, respectively. Healing rates at 4 and 8 weeks were 50% and 94% in the b.i.d. group and 35% and 68% in the q.i.d. group. There was no significant difference in healing rates between the groups. No serious adverse effect was observed in either group. These results suggest that the 2 g b.i.d. dose of sucralfate in granule form is at least as effective as the conventional dose of 1 g q.i.d. in the treatment of active gastric ulcers and could lead to better patient compliance. 
Vasospasm in a coronary artery aneurysm. Coronary artery aneurysms are not believed to have enough intact smooth muscle to generate significant vasoconstriction. A case is presented illustrating vasospasm of a large fusiform aneurysm of a right coronary artery during angioplasty. Pathophysiology of aneurysms is discussed. 
A case of intracerebral air embolism secondary to the insertion of a Hickman line. Complications following the insertion of intravenous catheters are relatively uncommon. We report a potentially serious, hitherto unrecognized complication of Hickman line insertion, and discuss the condition. 
Difficult pediatric diagnoses. Bruising and bleeding [published erratum appears in Pediatr Clin North Am 1991 Oct;38(5):viii] An approach to the evaluation of a child who presents to the pediatrician with bruising is outlined. Important clues in the history and physical examination that suggest disorders of platelet number and function or coagulation abnormalities are presented. A scheme for using screening tests of coagulation and platelet function is followed by a brief summary of currently available therapies appropriate for bleeding episodes in children. 
Clinical and financial audit of diagnostic protocols for lesions of the cerebellopontine angle OBJECTIVE--To assess the diagnostic efficiency and costs of protocols used for investigating patients with suspected lesions of the cerebellopontine angle. DESIGN--Prospective evaluation of tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds, electronystagmography, and calorics. Positive test results were confirmed or refuted by high resolution computed tomography with intravenous enhancement. SETTING--Single general otolaryngology clinic in a teaching hospital. PATIENTS--270 consecutive patients with sensorineural hearing loss requiring investigation to exclude a lesion of the cerebellopontine angle. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Estimated costs of various diagnostic protocols and performance in detecting tumours of the cerebellopontine angle. RESULTS--Protocols including tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds as sifting tests before computed tomography were clinically acceptable and presented considerable savings over the use of computed tomography in all patients (74,000 pounds or 84,000 pounds v 122,000 pounds). The use of electronystagmography and calorics could not be justified on clinical or financial grounds. CONCLUSIONS--Audiological tests of auditory brain stem responses and acoustic reflex thresholds followed by computed tomography constitute the most cost effective protocol for determining suspected lesions of the cerebellopontine angle. IMPLICATIONS--The cost effectiveness of diagnostic protocols should be evaluated throughout the health service. 
Acute pulmonary hypertensive crisis in a patient with primary pulmonary hypertension treated by both epoprostenol (prostacyclin) and nitroprusside. A 19-year-old girl was diagnosed as having primary pulmonary hypertension that was confirmed by right heart catheterization. Acute right heart failure was associated with syncope. Stabilization, while not achieved with intravenous epoprostenol (Prostacyclin) alone, was achieved with intravenous prostacyclin and nitroprusside. 
The treatment of ankle valgus by surface epiphysiodesis. Progressive ankle valgus in childhood requiring surgical correction is usually because of paralytic disease or conditions that produce a short distal fibula such as multiple exostoses or both. Surface epiphysiodesis of the distal medial tibial physis was used to correct valgus deformity in ten ankles in seven patients. This procedure has been found to be a simple and effective method of treatment. Measurement of the degree of valgus and calculation of the remaining growth of the distal tibial physis are recommended to determine whether this procedure will be effective. It is most often indicated in the presence of moderate valgus in children aged 11 to 14 years. 
Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty in obstructive apnea. Value of preoperative localization of site of upper airway narrowing during sleep. We hypothesized that those obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with upper airway collapse during sleep within the transpalatal airway would have a more favorable response to uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPP) than those patients with obstruction within the hypopharyngeal airway. We tested this hypothesis in seven OSA patients with transpalatal and seven with hypopharyngeal obstruction undergoing UPP. Preoperatively the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) was different between palatal and hypopharyngeal obstructors, 37.8 +/- 6.0 (+/- SEM) and 63.9 +/- 6.3, respectively (p less than 0.05), but the apnea-associated arterial oxygen desaturation and the lowest sleep saturation level were not different between the two groups. Postoperatively the AHI was 17.6 +/- 7.2 in the palatal obstructors and 40.3 +/- 15.6 in the hypopharyngeal obstructors (both p less than 0.05 from preoperative AHI). The palatal obstructors had a significant decrease in the percentage of sleep time spent apneic and the hypopharyngeal obstructors had a significant decrease in the hypopnea, but not apnea, time following surgery. The palatal obstructors had a significantly higher postoperative arterial oxygen saturation than the hypopharyngeal obstructors. Two hypopharyngeal obstructors worsened postoperatively. In addition we found that regardless of the site of the obstruction preoperatively, all obstructions occurred at the level of the palate postoperatively. We conclude that patients with preoperative transpalatal obstruction had diminution in obstructive apneas and those with hypopharyngeal obstruction had diminution in hypopneas but not apneas. Oxygenation was better postoperatively in the palatal obstructors, and none worsened postoperatively. These results suggest that identification of the site of upper airway obstruction in OSA may be beneficial. 
A rare complication of mitral valve replacement. Intraoperative fracture of the right fibrous trigone following a superior approach to the left atrium. Case report. A rare complication of mitral valve replacement is reported. Following a superior approach, through the roof of the left atrium the mitral valve was replaced with a Bjork-Shiley prosthesis in a 52-year-old female, who had undergone previous closed commissurotomy. Fracture of the right fibrous trigone occurred at surgery, following the completion of mitral valve replacement. The lesion was successfully repaired on cardiopulmonary bypass under cardioplegic arrest, placing sutures, after an oblique aortotomy, from below the noncoronary aortic cusp. The postoperative course was uneventful, without occurrence of a-v block. We believe that a superior approach to the left atrium may be a valid alternative for mitral valve surgery in some selected cases. 
Primary embryonal-cell carcinoma of the parietal lobe. Case report. A case of primary embryonal-cell carcinoma of the parietal lobe is reported. The unusually chronic presentation of such a malignant tumor is described. The atypical computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging characteristics of this lesion are presented. Review of the literature yielded no previous reports of a lobar embryonal-cell carcinoma. The rarity of intracranial germ-cell tumors presenting off the midline is discussed. 
The role of enhanced vagal activity on ischemic ventricular tachycardia: pharmacologic basis of inefficiency. The effects of pharmacologic modulation of vagal activity on ischemic ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in 21 conscious dogs after permanent left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) occlusion. Studies were done on spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 383 +/- 100 msec, n = 21), 24 to 72 hours after LAD occlusion, and on inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 251 +/- 30 msec, n = 6), 4 to 7 days after LAD occlusion. Edrophonium (1 mg/kg intravenously), a cholinesterase inhibitor, and methacholine (0.1 to 1 mg intravenously), a muscarinic agonist, had no significant effect on the rate or QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia, despite severe slowing of the sinoatrial rate. Similarly, atropine (up to 60 micrograms/kg intravenously) had no effect on the rate and QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia. In an attempt to enhance myocardial drug delivery to the ischemic and infarcted left ventricle, edrophonium (1 mg/kg) and methacholine (0.1 to 0.2 mg) were injected retrogradely through the great cardiac vein. This did not impart any significant therapeutic advantage over the systemic intravenous route. Sympathetic beta blockade did not affect the therapeutic outcome (n = 5) with either edrophonium or methacholine. It is concluded that direct or indirect enhancement of cardiac vagal activity has no effect on ischemic ventricular tachycardia in this model of subacute myocardial infarction. The lack of efficacy appears to be independent of myocardial drug delivery to ischemic ventricular site(s) and background sympathetic activity. Such a lack of efficacy may be caused by ischemia-mediated degeneration of vagal nerve terminals, by altered responsiveness of muscarinic receptors at infarcted arrhythmogenic myocardial sites, or both. 
Conventional MR neuroangiography. MR angiography of the brain plays an important role in the diagnosis of vessel thrombosis and dissection, giant aneurysms, and occult vascular malformations. This essay highlights some of the features of the intra- and extracranial circulation that make conventional MR neuroangiography valuable in the demonstration of vascular anatomy and vascular disease. 
Comparative study of glass and antimony electrodes for continuous oesophageal pH monitoring. Oesophageal pH monitoring data are influenced by numerous patient or technique related factors, or both. In this study, data recorded with glass microelectrodes or antimony electrodes, both with external cutaneous Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, connected to two different recording devices are compared. Pearson correlation coefficients regarding the reflux index (% of the investigation time with a pH less than 4) ranged from poor to excellent (0.55 to 1.00). Differences in data recorded with glass electrodes are not significantly dependent on the recording device (r:0.93 to 1.00 for the reflux index). The correlation between data simultaneously recorded with antimony electrodes is lower, although not significantly different for the reflux index (0.90). Correlation between data recorded with glass and antimony probes is rather poor (0.55 to 0.70). Therefore data recorded with antimony electrodes cannot be compared with those recorded with glass electrodes. The mean pH recorded with glass electrodes is lower than that with antimony probes. 
Surgical pathology of gastrinoma. Site, size, multicentricity, association with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, and malignancy. Specimens from the pancreas and duodenum of 26 patients with sporadic Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) and 18 patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1) and hypergastrinemia (17 with ZES) were screened immunocytochemically for gastrinomas. Location, size, multicentricity, and malignancy of the gastrinomas were evaluated. The MEN-1 patients had gastrinomas in the duodenum (nine of 18), pancreas (one of 18), and periduodenal lymph nodes (two of 18). No gastrinoma was identified in six patients. Most duodenal gastrinomas were multiple (five of nine) and smaller than 0.6 cm (six of nine). Lymph node metastases were present in eight of 12 patients. All 26 patients with sporadic ZES had a solitary gastrinoma; 14 were found in the pancreas and had a diameter greater than 2 cm. Ten patients had a duodenal gastrinoma, two with a diameter less than 0.6 cm. In two patients, only periduodenal "lymph node gastrinomas" were detected. Eighteen of the sporadic gastrinomas were malignant. These results suggest that duodenal location and multicentricity of gastrinomas are associated with the MEN-1 syndrome, and solitary gastrinomas, either in the pancreas or the duodenum, are predominantly seen in sporadic ZES. 
Relative effects of diarrhea, fever, and dietary energy intake on weight gain in rural Bangladeshi children. Quantitative studies of morbidity, food intake, and somatic growth were done prospectively during 14 mo for 70 children aged 5-18 mo in two Bangladeshi villages. When random-effect regression models were used, monthly changes in weight were inversely related to proportions of days in the month with fever and diarrhea and positively related to energy intake per kilogram body weight. Interestingly, weight changes did not vary with age in this interval. Estimates indicate that increasing energy intakes to the recommended World Health Organization level would have a significantly greater effect on weight gain than would the elimination of diarrhea and fever. With energy at recommended intake and diarrhea and fever prevalence as found in US children, weight gain is predicted to be near that of the international reference population. Therefore, interventions aimed at improving dietary intake may be as important as infection-control programs for improving growth of children in poor developing nations. 
Central retinal vein occlusion associated with drusen of the optic disc. A 43-year-old man had gradual visual changes OD. Funduscopic examination revealed central retinal vein occlusion OD. Complete ocular examination revealed bilateral drusen of the optic disc, confirmed by b-scan ultrasonography. Complete systemic evaluation showed no other etiology for the central retinal vein occlusion. Over a ten-year follow-up, in the absence of systemic disease or other local ocular anomalies, we concluded that central retinal vein occlusion can arise from external compression secondary to drusen of the optic disc. 
A method for allocation of hearing handicap. A three-stage method is proposed for allocation of hearing handicap. First, for a given injury or noise exposure period, the percentage of loss allocable for each ear is calculated as a simple ratio of hearing change (after age correction) to final hearing level. Second, final hearing handicap is divided between the two ears using a formula derived from the 1979 AAO-HNS/AMA standard. The percentage of hearing handicap allocable to a given period for each ear is simply the product of that ear's scores from the first two steps. 
Acceleration of chronic myeloid leukemia correlates with calcitonin gene hypermethylation. Calcitonin gene methylation at CCGG sites were determined in 39 chronic myeloid leukemia patients by isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease analysis. A total of 27 patients were analyzed while still in the chronic phase: 20 patients had a normal gene, and seven had a hypermethylated gene. There were 12 patients initially studied in accelerated or blastic phases. All but one patient showed gene hypermethylation, suggesting a good correlation between gene methylation and disease stage. All five patients who, while still in the chronic phase, had a major 3.1-kb hypermethylated calcitonin gene fragment, accelerated within 2 to 27 months. In consecutively analyzed patients, the initially normal calcitonin gene changed to a hypermethylated state as the disease escalated. The hypermethylation predicted disease acceleration with a median lead time of 6 months before any morphologic or clinical signs of disease progression were seen. The disease progressed in 8 of 27 patients initially studied in the chronic phase: in only two patients this occurred without predictive methylation changes. The results suggest that the assessment of calcitonin gene methylation status may be a promising tool for monitoring chronic myeloid leukemia disease escalation. 
Single photon emission computed tomography in patients with acute hydrocephalus or with cerebral ischaemia after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), cerebral blood flow was studied in eight patients with gradual deterioration in the level of consciousness after subarachnoid haemorrhage. Four had cerebral ischaemia and four had acute hydrocephalus. In patients with cerebral ischaemia, single photon emission computed tomography scanning showed multiple regions with decreased uptake of technetium-99M labelled d,l-hexamethyl-propylene amine oxime (99mTcHM-PAO) mainly in watershed areas. In patients with acute hydrocephalus, decreased uptake was seen mainly in the basal parts of the brain: around the third ventricle, around the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles, and in the basal part of the frontal lobe. After serial lumbar puncture, there was improvement of the uptake of 99mTc HM-PAO in these basal areas in three (convincingly in two and slightly in the other) of the four patients accompanied by clinical improvement in these three patients. These results suggest that patients with acute hydrocephalus and impaired consciousness after SAH, in contrast to patients with cerebral ischaemia, have decreased cerebral blood flow predominantly in the basal parts of the brain. 
Clinical pharmacology of calcium antagonists. There have been major advances in the understanding of the basic pharmacology of drugs acting upon voltage-dependent and receptor-activated calcium channels using patch-clamp techniques. The structure of the L channel is known and the (different) binding sites for various calcium antagonists have been identified using the methods of molecular biology. Although calcium slow-channel antagonists are very widely used in the treatment of hypertension, advances in the clinical pharmacology of angina and, to a lesser extent, cardiac arrhythmias, have not kept up with the basic research in molecular biology. All of the calcium antagonists in current use dilate arteries, and their therapeutic action largely depends on this property. There is evidence of differences in response between arteries and veins, and some degree of selectivity between vascular territories, but the goal of much more specific or localized vasodilation has not been achieved. The most prominent difference between the three main classes of antihypertensive drugs is the mild reflex increase of heart rate seen with the dihydropyridines and the bradycardia seen with verapamil. Most of the side effects of calcium antagonists are also based on vasodilatation, such as flushing and headache. The mild edema often seen with the dihydropyridines probably depends on the changes in capillary pressure brought about by arterial dilatation. Despite their undoubted efficacy as vasodilators, there are no studies thus far which allow any conclusions as to the long-term effect of calcium antagonists on the morbidity and mortality due to hypertension. 
Efficient immortalization of luminal epithelial cells from human mammary gland by introduction of simian virus 40 large tumor antigen with a recombinant retrovirus. When defined in terms of markers for normal cell lineages, most invasive breast cancer cells correspond to the phenotype of the common luminal epithelial cell found in the terminal ductal lobular units. Luminal epithelial cells cultured from milk, which have limited proliferative potential, have now been immortalized by introducing the gene encoding simian virus 40 large tumor (T) antigen. Infection with a recombinant retrovirus proved to be 50-100 times more efficient than calcium phosphate transfection, and of the 17 cell lines isolated, only 5 passed through a crisis period as characterized by cessation of growth. When characterized by immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies, 14 lines showed features of luminal epithelial cells and of these, 7 resembled the common luminal epithelial cell type in the profile of keratins expressed. These cells express keratins 7, 8, 18, and 19 homogeneously and do not express keratin 14 or vimentin; a polymorphic epithelial mucin produced in vivo by luminal cells is expressed heterogeneously and the pattern of fibronectin staining is punctate. Although the cell lines have a reduced requirement for added growth factors, they do not grow in agar or produce tumors in the nude mouse. When the v-Ha-ras oncogene was introduced into two of the cell lines by using a recombinant retrovirus, most of the selected clones senesced, but one entered crisis and emerged after 3 months as a tumorigenic cell line. 
Effects of variable dose milrinone in patients with low cardiac output after cardiac surgery. European Multicenter Trial Group. We studied 99 adult patients after elective cardiac surgery who had low cardiac output (cardiac index less than 2.5 L/min/m2) in spite of adequate cardiac filling pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure less than 8 mm Hg). Patients received milrinone by loading dose (50 micrograms/kg over a 10-minute period), followed by a continuous infusion of either 0.375, 0.5, or 0.75 micrograms/kg/min (low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) given for a minimum of 12 hours. Patients were allocated to each dosage group sequentially, not randomly. Hemodynamic measurements were made before the loading dose and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, 3, 6, and 12 hours after the start of milrinone therapy. Further measurements were made at 2 and 4 hours after treatment was stopped. Milrinone therapy was associated with a rapid, well-sustained, and highly significant increase in cardiac index in all three dose groups (p less than 0.001), and a similar fall occurred in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in all groups (p less than 0.001). Significant increases occurred in heart rate in all three groups (p less than 0.001). Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance also fell significantly, although changes in this latter parameter were less predictable and more dose dependent. Few serious treatment-related adverse effects were seen. We conclude that intravenous milrinone is an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of low output states after cardiac surgery. 
Biomechanical changes at the ankle joint after stroke. The resistance of the relaxed ankle to slow displacement over the joint movement range was measured on both sides of a group of hemiparetic stroke patients, in whom spasticity had been established for at least one year and who showed no clinical signs of contractures. The ankle joints of the age-matched normal subjects were flexible over most of the movement range, showing dramatically increasing stiffness only when the foot was dorsiflexed beyond 70 degrees, with a neutral range between 90-100 degrees, and a less dramatic increase in stiffness during plantarflexion. Hemiparetic patients showed identical curves to the normal subjects on the "healthy" side, ipsilateral to the causative cerebral lesion, but were significantly stiffer in dorsiflexion on the contralateral side, without change in the minimum stiffness range or during plantarflexion. Therefore significant changes in passive biomechanical properties occur at the affected ankle of hemiparetic subjects, predominantly as the result of a loss of compliance in the Achilles tendon, although an increase in the passive stiffness of the triceps surae may also occur. The contribution of these changes to the locomotor disability of hemiparetic patients is discussed. 
Abnormalities of the foot in patients with diabetes mellitus: findings on MR imaging. The MR appearances of foot problems in patients with diabetes mellitus are illustrated. MR has been found to be effective in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis, the most common indication for imaging the feet of diabetic patients. MR has the ability to image numerous pathologic processes, especially subtle soft-tissue changes, that are not detectable with other imaging methods. 
Neurologic aspects of cobalamin deficiency. We reviewed 153 episodes of cobalamin deficiency involving the nervous system that occurred in 143 patients seen over a recent 17-year period at 2 New York City hospitals. Pernicious anemia was the most common underlying cause of the deficiency. Neurologic complaints, most commonly paresthesias or ataxia, were the first symptoms of Cbl deficiency in most episodes. The median duration of symptoms before diagnosis and treatment with vitamin B12 was 4 months, although long delays in diagnosis occurred in some patients. Diminished vibratory sensation and proprioception in the lower extremities were the most common objective findings. A wide variety of neurologic symptoms and signs were encountered, however, including ataxia, loss of cutaneous sensation, muscle weakness, diminished or hyperactive reflexes, spasticity, urinary or fecal incontinence, orthostatic hypotension, loss of vision, dementia, psychoses, and disturbances of mood. Multiple neurologic syndromes were often seen in a single patient. In 42 (27.4%) of the 153 episodes, the hematocrit was normal, and in 31 (23.0%), the mean corpuscular volume was normal. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were unusual even in anemic patients. In nonanemic patients in whom diagnosis was delayed, neurologic progression frequently occurred although the hematocrit remained normal. In 27 episodes, the serum cobalamin concentration was only moderately decreased (in the range of 100-200 pg/ml) and in 2 the serum level was normal. Neurologic impairment, as assessed by a quantitative severity score, was judged to be mild in 99 episodes, moderate in 39 and severe in 15. Severity of neurologic dysfunction before treatment was clearly related to the duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis. In addition, the hematocrit correlated significantly with severity, independent of the longer duration of symptoms in nonanemic patients. Four patients experienced transient neurologic exacerbations soon after beginning treatment with cyanocobalamin, with subsequent recovery. Followup evaluation was adequate to assess the neurologic response to vitamin B12 therapy in 121 episodes. All patients responded, and in 57 (47.1%), recovery was complete, with no remaining symptoms or findings on examination. The severity score was reduced by 50% or greater after treatment in 91% of the episodes. Residual long-term moderate or severe neurologic disability was noted following only 7 (6.3%) episodes. The extent of neurologic involvement after treatment was strongly related to that before therapy as well as to the duration of symptoms. The percent improvement over baseline neurologic status after treatment was inversely related to duration of symptoms and hematocrit. Some evidence of response was always seen during the first 3 months of treatment.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Mortality in a cohort of long-term users of hormone replacement therapy: an updated analysis. OBJECTIVE--To reexamine the mortality experience of a cohort of long-term users of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in comparison with that reported previously for the same cohort of women, paying particular attention to cardiovascular mortality, deaths from breast and endometrial cancer, and deaths attributed to suicide or suspected suicide. DESIGN--Longitudinal cohort of 4544 long-term users of HRT amongst whom mortality is being monitored prospectively in comparison with expected rates in the female population of England and Wales (taking account of age and calendar period). SUBJECTS--4544 women, all of whom were recruited from specialist menopause clinics around Britain and had taken at least one year's continuous HRT at the time of recruitment to the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--All cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, deaths from female cancers, deaths attributed to suicide or suspected suicide. RESULTS--Overall mortality (based on 236 deaths over the entire study period from recruitment to December 1988) remained significantly lower than expected on the basis of national rates (relative risk (RR) 0.56, 95% confidence limits (CL) 0.47-0.66). When specific causes were considered, the only mortality ratios greater than unity were for injury, poisoning and violence (1.54, 95% CL 1.02-2.06), and for suicide and suspected suicide ('suicide') (2.40, 95% CL 1.68-3.11). Comparison of the ratios for the 112 additional deaths with those obtained in our previous analysis revealed that one of the few ratios to show any increase was that for breast cancer mortality. This rose from a significant deficit of 0.55 (95% CL 0.28-0.96) in the earlier period to 1.00 (95% CL 0.55-1.45) in the later period. There was also a suggestion of an increase in breast cancer risk with increasing duration since first use of HRT. Most of the other cause-specific ratios were very similar over the two periods. The ratio of death from all circulatory diseases was notably lower in the later analysis (RR 0.37, 95% CL 0.15-0.58) than in the earlier analysis (0.51, 95% CL 0.36-0.69), as were all of the subcategories of cardiovascular death. The mortality ratio for cancer of the ovary and uterine adnexa fell from 1.12 in the previous analysis to 0.63 (95% CL 0-1.41). The mortality ratio for 'suicide' also decreased, but was only slightly lower in the later period. As before, however, there was evidence of a relatively high prevalence of prior psychiatric problems amongst the recent 'suicide' deaths, suggesting that the excess of deaths from 'suicide' may be a manifestation of selection. CONCLUSION--These data are consistent with a beneficial effect of HRT on cardiovascular diseases, although updated information comparing progestogen-opposed and -unopposed treatment is not available. The increase in breast cancer mortality contrasts with the pattern for all other specific causes examined; taken together with the suggestion of an increase in breast cancer mortality with increasing interval since first exposure to HRT, this finding is somewhat worrying. 
Hereditary hyperparathyroidism and multiple ossifying jaw fibromas: a clinically and genetically distinct syndrome. A large previously reported family with hyperparathyroidism has been reinvestigated recently because of the occurrence of multiple ossifying jaw fibromas in two affected members of the third generation similar to the jaw tumors of four of five affected members of the first generation. These maxillary and mandibular tumors can be differentiated from the "brown tumors" of hyperparathyroidism because they can appear and enlarge even though the hypercalcemia is surgically corrected. These tumors are histologically distinct fibroosseous lesions without the giant cells seen in "brown tumors." The parathyroid enlargement was mostly uniglandular, with multiple tumors found occasionally. Studies in DNA linkage were performed within this large family and a similar family in Houston to determine if the gene for this syndrome, termed HRPT2, is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 11, to which the gene for multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 has been linked. (This linkage is supported by our findings in one family with MEN 1 reported here.) Linkage studies were also performed with markers on chromosome 10, to which the genes for MEN 2A and MEN 2B have been linked. Evidence against close linkage with chromosome 10 and chromosome 11 markers suggests that this clinically distinct syndrome is also genetically distinct. 
Association of a precore genomic variant of hepatitis B virus with fulminant hepatitis. A variant of hepatitis B virus has been described recently in HBsAg+ Mediterranean patients who lack HBeAg and who have an unusual and severe form of chronic hepatitis. This variant is unable to produce HBeAg because of the presence of a novel translational stop codon at the end of the precore region of the genome. By direct sequencing of DNA, generated by the polymerase chain reaction, we have evaluated the association between infection with this variant and the fulminant course of hepatitis B. Eighteen patients with fulminant hepatitis B were studied. Of the 15 cases from whose serum viral DNA could be sequenced, the variant was found in the admission sera of 8 of 9 HBeAg- patients but in none of 6 HBeAg+ patients who had fulminant hepatitis B. Patients harboring the variant progressed more rapidly into hepatic encephalopathy, but those infected with the variant strain alone had a greater likelihood of survival than those infected with the normal strain or a mixture. The mutant strain may emerge spontaneously during fulminant hepatitis as occurs in chronic hepatitis B infection during seroconversion from HBeAg to antibody. Alternately, and perhaps less commonly, patients may be infected with the variant ab initio. 
Accidental and intentional poisonings with ethylene glycol in infancy: diagnostic clues and management. Ethylene glycol has long been recognized as a potentially lethal poison and remains available today as automotive antifreeze and windshield deicer fluids. Ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with peak levels measured one to four hours after ingestion. Metabolism of the parent compound and the production of several organic acids are responsible for the metabolic acidosis observed in ethylene glycol poisoning. Target organ cellular damage is seen in the kidney, brain, myocardium, pancreas, and blood vessel walls. Renal tubular deposition of calcium oxalate crystals is felt to be responsible for the development of the severe renal injury which may accompany ethylene glycol ingestion. The clinical course is quite varied and includes inebriation, hematuria, cardiorespiratory compromise, and neurologic effects. Prompt diagnosis and initiation of treatment, including ethanol therapy and hemodialysis, is necessary to ameliorate the effects of ethylene glycol ingestion. Two cases of ethylene glycol poisoning, one accidental and one intentional, are reviewed. 
Psychological events are both risk factors in, and consequences of, chronic pain. This study questioned 2 assumptions often inherent in psychogenic explanations of pain: (1) that a relationship exists between pain and life events predating pain onset, and (2) that pain patients are a psychologically homogeneous group. Chronic pain sufferers in multiple settings and control subjects participated in this study in which the relationships between pain and 20 psychological variables were examined. Pain was defined and assessed in 3 different ways: (1) membership in a pain group, (2) number of specialists consulted for pain, and (3) pain intensity. Of the 20 psychological variables examined, only less emotional repression and greater "ergomania" (excessive work) were consistently associated with pain on all 3 pain criteria. In addition, pain patients were more likely to have had a relative with pain. Comparisons of pain patients in different settings showed that pain clinic patients reported having been more active throughout their lives, but were currently more depressed and experienced less life satisfaction than patients who were not in a specialized pain centre. These results are interpreted in the light of current multicausal views of pain and conclusions are drawn about the role of psychological variables both as risk factors in, and as consequences of pain. 
Modulation of alpha smooth muscle actin and desmin expression in perisinusoidal cells of normal and diseased human livers. It has been suggested that perisinusoidal liver cells (PSC) play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of fibrocontractive changes. Using light and electron microscopic immunolocalization techniques, a series of 207 normal and pathologic human liver specimens were evaluated for the expression of alpha smooth muscle (SM) actin and desmin in this and other nonparenchymal cell types. In normal adult liver tissue, PSCs were practically devoid of desmin and exceptionally stained for alpha-SM actin, whereas this actin isoform frequently was encountered in PSCs from the embryonic to the adolescent period. A broad spectrum of pathologic conditions was accompanied by the presence of alpha-SM actin containing PSCs; these were detected preferentially in periportal or perivenular zones according to the predominant location of the underlying hepatocellular damage. The occurrence of this PSC phenotype generally was associated with fibrogenesis and was in some cases detected earlier than overt collagen accumulation. Fibrous bands subdividing liver tissue in cirrhosis and focal nodular hyperplasia, as well as desmoplastic reaction to malignant tumors, contained alpha-SM actin-rich cells admixed with variable proportions of cells coexpressing desmin. In end stages, this population was less numerous than in active fibrotic or cirrhotic processes. Using immunogold electron microscopy, alpha-SM actin was localized in microfilament bundles of typical PSCs. Our results are compatible with the assumption that the appearance of alpha-SM actin and desmin-expressing myofibroblasts results at least in part from a phenotypic modulation of PSCs. 
Long term reduction in sodium balance: possible additional mechanism whereby nifedipine lowers blood pressure OBJECTIVE--To assess the changes in sodium excretion and sodium balance after withdrawal of long term nifedipine. DESIGN--Single blind, placebo controlled study in patients receiving fixed sodium and potassium intakes. SETTING--Blood pressure unit of a teaching hospital in south London. PATIENTS--Eight patients with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension who had been taking nifedipine 20 mg twice daily for at least six weeks. INTERVENTIONS--Withdrawal of nifedipine and replacement with matching placebo for one week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Urinary sodium excretion and cumulative sodium balance, body weight, plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations, plasma renin activity and aldosterone concentrations, and blood pressure. RESULTS--During nifedipine withdrawal there was a significant reduction in urinary sodium excretion (day 1: -62.7 mmol/24 h; 95% confidence interval -90.3 to -35.0) and each patient retained a mean of 146 (SEM 26) mmol sodium over the week of replacement with placebo. Body weight and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations increased during the placebo period and seemed to be associated with the amount of sodium retained. Systolic blood pressure rose from 157 (9) to 165 (9) mmHg (95% confidence interval of difference -7.1 to 22.1) when nifedipine was replaced with matching placebo, and the rise seemed to be related to the amount of sodium that was retained. CONCLUSIONS--Nifedipine causes a long term reduction in sodium balance in patients with essential hypertension. This long term effect may contribute to the mechanism whereby nifedipine lowers blood pressure. 
Distribution of porfiromycin in EMT6 solid tumors and normal tissues of BALB/c mice. The distribution of porfiromycin was studied in BALB/c mice bearing EMT6 mammary tumors. The levels of 3H in blood and most tissues peaked approximately 15 minutes after intraperitoneal injection of [3H]porfiromycin. The levels of radioactivity present in most of the tissues and in the tumors were similar at 4 hours and 24 hours after administration. Most of the normal tissues showed uniform, low grain densities when analyzed by autoradiography; the liver and the small intestine had the highest labeling densities. Only kidney, bladder, and tumor showed differential distributions of grains from [3H]porfiromycin. In the kidney, higher grain counts were found in cortex than in medullary regions; grains were uniformly distributed within each region. In the bladder, the highest labeling densities were found in regions near the lumen. Tumor regions that had some necrotic features or regions of necrosis that included some viable cells showed higher labeling intensities than healthy-looking tumor regions, probably because the abnormal microenvironments in these regions led to increased rates of activation of porfiromycin to electrophilic species. These findings show that porfiromycin can reach and be activated in tumor regions containing cells resistant to many chemotherapeutic agents and to x rays. The results also support the concept that agents such as porfiromycin can target cells in specific microenvironmental subpopulations of solid tumors. 
Electrophysiologic study in acute lead poisoning. A 2-month-old girl with acute lead poisoning demonstrated electrophysiologic evidence of neurotoxicity. Motor nerve conduction studies of the median, ulnar, peroneal, and posterior tibial nerves revealed both axonal and demyelinating neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potential studies of median and posterior tibial nerves demonstrated evidence of cortical involvement. Brainstem auditory evoked potential study disclosed the possibility of acoustic nerve involvement but no evidence of a brainstem lesion. Postmortem examination revealed cerebral edema and focal segmental demyelination of the median nerve. 
Pericardial cyst with partial erosion of the right ventricular wall. A case of pericardial cyst with partial erosion into the anterior wall of the right ventricle is presented. Cardiopulmonary bypass was necessary for excision of the cyst. This report helps to alert surgeons of the possible need for cardiopulmonary bypass during the removal of some pericardial cysts, especially in patients with signs and symptoms of infection and in whom preoperative imaging fails to show distinct margins between the cyst and cardiac structures. 
Current perception threshold screening for carpal tunnel syndrome. Screening for the onset of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), which is associated with excess ergonomic stresses of the wrist and hand, is a major concern in occupational medicine. CTS questionnaires, physical examinations, and quantitative sensory function determination through neuroselective current perception threshold (CPT) measurements were obtained from the median digital nerves of 16 assembly line workers who were symptomatic with hand pain. Median nerve evaluations by CPT detected sensory abnormalities in 75% of the workers, and abnormalities in 50% of the workers were detected by clinical evaluations (p less than .05, df = 22). CPT abnormalities were characterized as "hypoesthetic" in 25% and hyperesthesic in 42% of the workers. The noninvasive, nonaversive CPT technique provided sensitive and easily obtained quantitative measures. Regular use of this procedure in the occupational setting may assist in preventing the development of advanced CTS for it provides early detection of median nerve abnormalities. 
Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML): comparison with Ph+ CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. The Groupe Francais de Cytogenetique Hematologique. To better understand the Philadelphia-negative (Ph-) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and its relationships with Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) CML and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), a study was undertaken by the Groupe Francais de Cytogenetique Hematologique. Thirty-five Ph- CML patients were investigated and compared with 55 chronic phase Ph+ CML and 100 CMML patients. There were 12 M-BCR positive (M-BCR+) and 23 M-BCR negative (MBCR+) patients. No clinical or biologic differences were found between Ph+ and Ph-, M-BCR+ patients. In the Ph- group, M-BCR+ and M-BCR- patients differed significantly in age (47.7 +/- 6.6 v 67.0 +/- 6.1 years, respectively; P = .001), leukocytosis (153.4 +/- 135.1 v 58.5 +/- 37.7 10(9)/L, P = .002), relative monocytosis (1.8% +/- 1.2% v 5.6% +/- 1.4%, P = .048), absolute basophilia (8.5 +/- 9.7 v 0.9 +/- 1.5 10(9)/L, P = .001), percentage of immature myeloid precursors (IMP) in peripheral blood (29.0% +/- 9.5% v 15.3% +/- 8.1%, P = .001), and percentage of erythroblasts in bone marrow (BM) (6.5% +/- 3.5% v 14.6% +/- 3.6%, P = .001). Karyotypic abnormalities other than the Ph chromosome occurred in 0 of 12 M-BCR- at diagnosis and 7 of 23 M-BCR- Ph- CML (P = .033). None of the 13 investigated BCR- patients had detectable BCR/ABL transcripts using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and none had an N-RAS mutation. Cytologic findings showed a marked morphologic difference between M-BCR+ and M-BCR- patients, especially in the monocytic lineage. Dysmyelopoietic features in CMML and M-BCR- patients were very similar, and the differences were of quantitative order only. Using four criteria (monocytosis, percentage of IMP, basophilia, and percentage of erythroblasts in BM), patients could be divided into typical and atypical CML and this classification correlated well with molecular findings. We conclude that, while Ph-, M-BCR+, and Ph+ CML are identical diseases, Ph-, M-BCR- CML, and CMML have many similarities and might be only different aspects of a same entity. 
Effect of cisapride on chronic idiopathic constipation in children. The efficacy of cisapride, a new prokinetic drug, as a treatment for chronic functional constipation of childhood was studied in 20 constipated children. Each subject had a stool frequency less than 4/week and/or total gastrointestinal transit time greater than 33 hr and was randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with either cisapride (N = 10) or placebo (N = 10) for 12 weeks. Stool habits, total gastrointestinal transit time, and anorectal motility were evaluated in all children before and at the end of the treatment period. Cisapride significantly increased stool frequency from 1.2 +/- 0.6 to 5.1 +/- 1.9 stools/week (mean +/- SD; P less than 0.05), whereas the lesser effect of placebo was not significant (1.2 +/- 0.8 to 2.8 +/- 0.8 stools/week; P = 0.4). Both treatments significantly (P less than 0.05) decreased laxative or suppository use. Total gastrointestinal transit time was decreased by cisapride (90.8 +/- 9.2 hr to 57.2 +/- 20.2 hr; P less than 0.05) but was not affected by placebo. Anorectal manometry showed that cisapride, but not placebo, significantly decreased the rectoanal inhibitory reflex threshold and the conscious rectal sensitivity threshold. It is concluded that cisapride improves gastrointestinal motility and bowel habits in children with chronic idiopathic constipation and may be useful in the management of some children with this disorder. 
Procurement and transplantation of colonized cadaver skin. Cadaver skin is an important adjunct to burn care. This study was designed to measure the percentage of its contamination prior to grafting and to determine the clinical safety of its use. Cadaveric homografts from 19 donors were harvested, frozen, thawed, and used as a biological dressing. Cultures were obtained at the time of harvest, after incubation in antibiotics, and at actual transplantation. The homografts were 43 per cent, 68 per cent, and 50 per cent contaminant-free, respectively. Two of 14 patients lost their homografts due to infection. However, no patient developed an infection or lost the homograft due to an organism identified during the pretransplantation processing. Therefore, contaminant-free and slightly contaminated cadaver skin can be used safely as homografts. 
Studies in autotomy: its pathophysiology and usefulness as a model of chronic pain. An interesting behavioral syndrome results in animals from the same or similar types of lesions that lead to deafferentation pain in humans; many neurectomized animals begin to scratch, bite, or self-mutilate their denervated limb, a phenomenon termed autotomy. The proposition that this behavior in animals is a response to the chronic pain of peripheral nerve injury has met with considerable controversy. If this issue were resolved, then a better understanding of the neurophysiology of autotomy might help elucidate the mechanisms of the human conditions. To determine the association between deafferentation and the autotomy behavior, we developed a pharmacologically induced functional deafferentation preparation using chronic perineural lidocaine infusion of the sciatic nerve. This 'chronic lidocaine' model's behavior was compared with that of the neurectomy model. While autotomy was noted in 80% of the latter group, no animal undergoing a chronic perineural infusion of lidocaine autotomized. We thus conclude that autotomy is not a response to non-painful sensory deafferentation, but rather that this behavior is a response to pain. We also studied the development of autotomy in a variety of other focal denervation preparations. On the basis of these data, we conclude that autotomy is not due to loss of sensory input on a functional basis nor to an action potential-mediated process. Rather, nerve damage which coincidentally involves sensory loss is necessary and sufficient for the development of this behavior. We suggest that interruption of a humoral feedback process homeostatically operating within the first order sensory neuron with its effect exerted post-synaptically leads to autotomy. The evidence supports the existence of a loss of a transportable, humoral autotomy inhibitory factor. 
Thrombosis in systemic lupus erythematosus: a French collaborative study. A retrospective study was undertaken of 120 children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) seen in Paris and its immediate suburbs who fulfilled at least four of the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for SLE, and in whom the disease was diagnosed before the age of 16 and between January 1975 and December 1987. Eleven of these children (eight girls and three boys) all more than 10 years of age (mean follow up 8.1 years; range 3-13) had thrombotic episodes (9%). Thrombosis was one of the presenting signs in seven patients; in five it was associated with typical symptoms of SLE, and in the other two the thrombotic episode was isolated and diagnosis of SLE was delayed one and three years. Of a total of 16 thrombotic episodes (six of which were recurrent), 14 involved the leg veins, and in four there was associated pulmonary embolism. There were two episodes that affected cerebral arteries. The American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for SLE as well as the incidence of lupus anticoagulant, positive direct Coombs test, and vasculitis in this group of patients was compared with the incidence in patients with SLE but no thrombosis. Only lupus anticoagulant was significantly associated with thrombotic episodes: eight of 11 (73%) of patients with SLE and thrombotic (arterial or venous) episodes had lupus anticoagulant compared with only 10 of 74 patients (14%) with no history of thrombotic events in the same age group. 
Stimulation of atrial natriuretic peptide and vasopressin during retrograde mitral valvuloplasty. Acute mitral obstruction may lead to an increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) due to increased atrial pressure and a large increase in arginine vasopressin (AVP) due to simultaneous arterial and ventricular baroreceptor unloading. We measured ANP and AVP concentration after transseptal puncture and during percutaneous retrograde mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PRMV) in 11 patients (mean age 57 +/- 12 years; nine women) with mitral stenosis and congestive heart failure. Atrial septal puncture per se resulted in a significant increase in ANP and AVP without a significant change in aortic pressure. Subsequent PRMV led to a further increase in ANP, a transient decrease in aortic pressure from 89 +/- 7 to 45 +/- 4 mm Hg, and a large (fivefold) increase in AVP. ANP and AVP were no longer different from baseline values 18 to 24 after the procedure. This study suggests that transseptal puncture and acute mitral obstruction are major stimuli to ANP release and that combined unloading of arterial and left ventricular mechanoreceptors is a very potent vasopressinergic stimulus. 
Cytokine messenger RNA stability is enhanced in tumor cells. Hematopoietic growth factors are produced by a number of human tumors. We extracted RNA from selected human tumor cells known to produce at least one hematopoietic growth factor and found high levels of abnormally stable cytokine messenger (m)RNA. Half-life experiments performed after preventing RNA synthesis by exposing cells to actinomycin D before RNA extraction showed stabilization of cytokine messages in tumor cells in liquid culture as well as in human tumor xenografts grown in mice. Exposure to the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (TPA) caused enhancement of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) message level in lung cancer cells and in control fibroblasts but elevated levels persisted far longer in the tumor cells. In normal cells, an AU-rich sequence in the 3' untranslated region of cytokine mRNAs confers lability to the message. Although a beta-globin gene expression vector containing this region appears to produce unstable mRNA in lung cancer cells, cytokine mRNAs, which also contain this sequence, are very stable in the tumors we studied. This may indicate that another region of the cytokine mRNA molecule is of greater importance than the AU-rich region in determining mRNA stability in tumor cells. 
Expression of embryonic globins by erythroid cells in juvenile chronic myelocytic leukemia. Juvenile chronic myelocytic leukemia (JCML) is a rare hematopoietic neoplasia of early childhood with distinct hematologic and biochemical features. We studied the biologic properties and the globin synthetic profiles of JCML erythroid cells both in vivo and in vitro from a total of 24 patients. In these cases we observed the exuberant colony-forming unit-macrophage (CFU-M) colony growth, as reported previously. Furthermore, in contrast to previous reports, we found significant erythroid colony growth in most of our cases (average: 1,182 burst-forming unit-erythroid [BFUe] per 10(5) plated cells, range: 40 to 6,927). This growth was by and large erythropoietin-dependent and was not greatly influenced by other added cytokines. By several criteria all erythroid colony growth detected in vitro was derived from JCML progenitors. The globin synthetic profile of JCML erythroid cells showed high levels of fetal hemoglobin both in vivo and in vitro (gamma/gamma + beta: 53% to 94% in reticulocytes, 62% to 98% in BFUe-derived cells). In addition (in seven cases studied) we detected embryonic globins (epsilon and zeta) at the protein and messenger RNA level, a novel finding for primary leukemic cells. We speculate that the transformed erythroid cells in JCML harbor a trans environment supporting expression of developmentally earlier genes (fetal, embryonic). However, in contrast to other acute or subacute leukemias, JCML erythroid cells also have the ability to reach full maturation to the red cell level, thus allowing detection of this primitive program in vivo. 
Midventricular obstruction associated with chronic systemic hypertension and severe left ventricular hypertrophy. Midventricular obstruction is an uncommon finding previously defined by catheterization and angiographic techniques in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This study describes the clinical and echocardiographic findings of 10 consecutive patients (mean age 73 years) with severe concentric left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy and the unusual finding of a dynamic systolic obstruction located in the midportion of the left ventricle. All patients were known to have chronic hypertension, and none had a history or family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In each case, a well-defined, high velocity, turbulent jet was identified by Doppler color flow imaging and subsequently confirmed with conventional Doppler techniques. Septal and posterior wall thickness averaged 1.67 and 1.57 cm, respectively. Mean LV mass index was 199 g/m2 and ejection fraction averaged 78%. Peak systolic velocity obtained by continuous-wave Doppler averaged 2.7 m/s and appeared as either a "late-peaking" or a "spike and dome" configuration. Seven of 10 patients gave a history of syncope or severe presyncope at the time of echocardiographic examination. At a mean follow-up of 1 year, syncope or presyncope had resolved in 5 patients in whom medication was adjusted based on the ultrasound study, but persisted in 2 patients in whom diuretic therapy was continued. It is concluded that obstruction to systolic flow can occur at the mid-LV level in some patients with severe concentric LV hypertrophy and avoidance of medication known to lower LV volume may relieve symptoms of transient inadequate cardiac output. 
Prognostic factors in the conservative treatment of ureteric stones. A prospective study was made of 125 ureteric stones in order to detect factors which would predict the successful outcome of conservative treatment. The factors studied were the duration of pain prior to presentation, pyuria, haematuria, surface regularity of the stone and the degree of obstruction as seen radiologically. In stones less than or equal to 10 mm in size, conservative treatment was successful when the duration of pain was less than 30 days (39/45), when there was no significant pyuria (53/82), when the stones had an irregular surface (44/65) and when obstruction was only partial (55/88). Since most of these factors were interactive, further statistical analysis showed that duration of pain was the only significant factor in predicting the outcome of conservative treatment. In stones greater than 10 mm in size these factors had no predictive value and only 2/23 were passed spontaneously on conservative treatment. 
A quantitative histopathological study of right bundle branch block complicating acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether necrosis of the right bundle branch is responsible for development of right bundle branch block in acute myocardial infarction. Twenty patients with acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction were studied--10 with right bundle branch block (group A) and 10 without (group B)--to evaluate by serial sectioning the pathological extent of myocardial infarction surrounding the right bundle branch and also that of right bundle branch necrosis. Myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch more than 8 mm above the moderator band in all of group A, whereas myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch less than 3 mm above the moderator band in only three patients in group B. Nine hearts in group A showed significant necrosis of the right bundle branch. In group B and in one case with transient right bundle branch block no necrosis was found. The occurrence of right bundle branch block was almost entirely explained by necrosis of the right bundle branch, but transient right bundle branch block did develop without necrosis of the right bundle branch. 
Shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia: effects of three different supports. Shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia is a difficult problem to manage and it may be associated with pain and other complications. Measurements taken from x-rays have been used to obtain objective measures of shoulder subluxation, but have not been used to compare the effects of different shoulder supports. This study used x-ray measurements to evaluate different shoulder supports for subluxation in hemiplegia and to see if there was a significant difference between the Harris hemisling and the Bobath sling. The Harris hemisling gave good vertical correction of subluxation and compared closely to the uninvolved shoulder. The Bobath sling did not correct the subluxation as well, and the mean difference between the two slings was significant. The arm trough or lap board was less effective and tended to overcorrect. The Harris hemisling and arm trough or lap board had horizontal measurements similar to the uninvolved shoulders. The Bobath sling, however, distracted the glenohumeral joint horizontally and was more variable. The mean horizontal difference between the Harris hemisling and the Bobath sling was significant. These results support the effectiveness and specificity of shoulder support to decrease subluxation after hemiplegia. 
Prevention of portal hypertension and portosystemic shunts by early chronic administration of clonidine in conscious portal vein-stenosed rats. The hemodynamic effects, including mesenteric-systemic shunts of early chronic administration of clonidine, were studied in conscious, unrestrained, portal vein-stenosed rats. In rats receiving early chronic clonidine (600 micrograms.kg-1.day-1 by gavage), begun 3 days before portal vein stenosis and then administered continuously for 10 consecutive days, portal pressure (10.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) and degree of mesenteric-systemic shunts (58% +/- 25%) were significantly lower than in the placebo group (15.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg and 83% +/- 7%, respectively). The effects were observed either 2 to 3 hr or 18 to 24 hr after the last dose of clonidine. In rats receiving clonidine continuously for 5 days, starting 5 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg) was significantly lower than in the placebo group, but mesenteric-systemic shunts (82% +/- 8%) were not significantly different. In rats receiving a single oral dose of clonidine (600 micrograms/kg) 10 days after portal vein stenosis, portal pressure (11.8 +/- 2.1 mm Hg), measured 2 to 3 hr after clonidine administration, was significantly lower than in the placebo group. Mesenteric-systemic shunts (83% +/- 8%), however, were not significantly different from the placebo group. In addition, 18 to 24 hr after a single dose of clonidine, hemodynamic values returned to basal conditions. We also demonstrated that chronic clonidine administration begun before portal vein stenosis can reduce the initial increase in portal pressure after this procedure. We concluded that early chronic clonidine administration reduces the severity of portal hypertension and the development of portosystemic shunts in portal vein-stenosed rats. 
Spinal muscular atrophy is not the result of mutations at the beta-hexosaminidase or GM2-activator locus. The disease locus for the clinically heterogeneous childhood spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) maps to the chromosome 5 subregion, 5q11.2-13.3. The beta-subunit of beta-D-N-acetylhexosaminidase (hexosaminidase) (EC 3.2.1.52) (Hex B) maps to the same region, and the protein required for substrate recognition by this enzyme, GM2-activator protein, likewise maps to chromosome 5. We have investigated the possibility of allelic variation among some forms of SMA and hexosaminidase deficiency. Recombination between the Hex B and SMA loci eliminates this enzyme as a candidate site for defects causing the illness. Furthermore, we show that, despite previous evidence to the contrary, the GM2-activator locus does not map to chromosome 5, thereby eliminating it as a candidate gene for SMA. 
Randomized comparative study of hemaccel vs. albumin infusion after total paracentesis in cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. Fifty-four cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites were treated with one-session large-volume paracentesis and randomly assigned to two groups. The first group was infused with human albumin, and the second group was infused with hemaccel at doses with comparable oncotic power. The two groups were compared for incidence of complications, recurrence of massive ascites after hospital dismissal and survival rate. The incidence of complications traditionally related to paracentesis, the probability of requiring readmission to the hospital for ascites (p = 0.48) and the probability of survival after entry into the study (p = 0.85) were the same for the two groups. A multivariate analysis of 16 parameters, including treatment modality, identified absolute unresponsiveness to diuretics as the only independent predictor of mortality. These results indicate that hemaccel infusion may safely replace albumin infusion after total paracentesis for cirrhotic patients with refractory ascites. 
Preoperative hemostatic activity and excessive bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass. The rationale for predicting the risk of excessive postoperative bleeding by assessing the hemostatic status of a patient before cardiopulmonary bypass was investigated. A novel, rapid, overall test (hemostatometry) consisting of a physiologically relevant test of platelet function (shear-induced hemostasis) and coagulation was performed using nonanticoagulated blood and compared with the routine coagulation screen. Two hundred five patients undergoing elective coronary revascularization were studied 3 to 4 days before operation. Forty-nine bled excessively for nonsurgical reasons; none were predicted by the routine coagulation tests. Using a stepwise discriminant analysis, hemostatometry correctly predicted 31 of 49 (63%). Thirty of 156 predicted as bleeders by hemostatometry did not bleed. Thus, preoperative hemostatometry predicted 77% of the true outcome. The false predictions suggest, however, that certain bleeding abnormalities probably acquired during cardiopulmonary bypass cannot be predicted. These findings do not justify the routine use of preoperative tests in assessing the bleeding risk in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. 
Estimates of radiation absorbed dose for intraperitoneally administered iodine-131 radiolabeled B72.3 monoclonal antibody in patients with peritoneal carcinomatoses. Using a newly available model for determining estimates of radiation absorbed dose of radioisotopes administered intraperitoneally, we have calculated absorbed dose to tumor and normal tissues based on a surgically controlled study of radiolabeled antibody distribution. Ten patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis received intraperitoneal injections of the murine monoclonal antibody B72.3 radiolabeled with 131I. Biodistribution studies were performed using nuclear medicine methods until laparotomy at 4-14 days after injection. Surgical biopsies of normal tissues and tumor were obtained. The marrow was predicted to be the critical organ, with maximum tolerated dose [200 rad (2 Gy) to marrow] expected at about 200 mCi (7.4 GBq). In patients with large intraperitoneal tumor deposits, the tumor itself is an important source tissue for radiation exposure to normal tissues. Local "hot-spots" for tumor-absorbed dose were observed, with maximum tumor-absorbed dose calculated at 11,000 rad (11 Gy) per 100 mCi (3.7 GBq) administered intraperitoneal; however, tumor rad dose varied considerably. This may pose serious problems for curative therapy, especially in patients with large tumor burdens. 
Use of hydroxyurea in chronic myeloid leukemia during pregnancy: a case report. The concomitant occurrence of pregnancy and chronic myeloid leukemia is uncommon. The use of hydroxyurea in chronic myeloid leukemia during pregnancy is unknown. We report on a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia in whom hydroxyurea was used during pregnancy with a successful outcome for both mother and fetus. 
Evidence for the segregation of a major gene in human susceptibility/resistance to infection by Schistosoma mansoni. Severe clinical disease caused by the major human parasite Schistosoma mansoni is the consequence of high and prolonged infections. Epidemiological studies indicate that, for individuals having frequent contacts with cercaria-infested waters, both infection intensities and reinfection after treatment depend, in large part, on their intrinsic susceptibility/resistance to infection, suggesting the role of genetic factors in human resistance to S. mansoni. To investigate whether a major gene controls human susceptibility/resistance to infection by S. mansoni, segregation analysis of infection intensities, adjusted for the factors relevant in schistosomiasis (water contact, age, sex), was performed on 20 Brazilian pedigrees (269 individuals), using both the unified mixed model and the regressive model of analysis. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that there is a codominant major gene controlling human susceptibility/resistance to infection by S. mansoni. Parameter estimates indicate a frequency of .20-.25 for the deleterious allele; thus, about 5% of the population is predisposed to high infections, 60% is resistant, and 35% has an intermediate, although fairly good, level of resistance. These findings provide a genetic basis for earlier observations on the lower resistance and the predisposition to reinfection of certain individuals. In addition to the detection of a major gene effect, the data suggest that immunity to S. mansoni develops progressively during childhood to reach a maximum around the age of puberty. The implications of these results for the strategy to be used in endemic areas to reduce morbidity and to control parasite transmission are discussed. 
Malignant fibrous histiocytoma in a recurrent thoracic chordoma: case report and literature review. Malignant transformation in a recurrent chordoma in the thoracic region is extremely uncommon. One new case, as well as a review of spinal chordomas that have undergone malignant transformation, is reported. Such cases emphasize the importance of the aggressive initial surgical treatment of spinal tumors. 
Effect of NG-monomethyl L-arginine on endothelium-dependent relaxation in arterioles of one-kidney, one clip hypertensive rats. Dose-response curves to topically applied acetylcholine, bradykinin, and nitroprusside were obtained by intravital microscopy in arcading arterioles of the spinotrapezius muscle of control (n = 9) and one-kidney, one clip hypertensive (1K1C) rats (n = 11) of 4 weeks' duration before and during superfusion with the specific inhibitor of nitric oxide formation NG-monomethyl L-arginine (LNMMA) (10(-4) M) and both LNMMA (10(-4) M) and indomethacin (2.8 x 10(-5) M). Resting arteriolar tone was higher in 1K1C rats than in controls, and vasodilation to acetylcholine and bradykinin, but not to nitroprusside, was reduced (p less than 0.05) in 1K1C rats compared with controls. LNMMA increased arteriolar tone (p less than 0.05) and inhibited the vasodilator responses to acetylcholine and bradykinin (p less than 0.05) in controls but not in 1K1C rats. LNMMA did not alter the response to nitroprusside in either group. Addition of indomethacin to LNMMA increased arteriolar tone and markedly reduced the response to bradykinin, but not to acetylcholine or nitroprusside, in both groups. These findings suggest that resting arteriolar tone is increased in 1K1C rats partially because of the decreased basal release or synthesis of nitric oxide. Responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and bradykinin were attenuated in 1K1C rats, possibly because of changes in synthesis or release of nitric oxide for acetylcholine and of prostacyclin for bradykinin, because the response to the endothelium-independent vasodilator nitroprusside did not differ between the groups. 
Mutations of the p53 gene in lymphoid leukemia. p53 is currently considered to be a tumor suppressor gene product, and its alterations are suggested to be involved in several human malignancies. Here we show evidence of the possible involvement of p53 gene mutations in lymphoid leukemias studied by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and nucleotide sequencing. Fourteen patients with various leukemias were examined and two with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and one with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia were identified to have mutations in the coding region of the p53 gene. These mutations included point mutation, triplet deletion, and single nucleotide insertion. Furthermore, expression of the wild-type p53 mRNA was not detected in the samples from these three patients. In one of them, chromosome 17p was deleted, suggesting the absence of the nonmutated p53 gene, whereas in the other two patients, chromosome 17p seemed to be intact by cytogenetic analysis. Our results suggest that alterations of the p53 gene may have a role in the genesis of some leukemias. 
Effects of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure on atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopressin release during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. 1. Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea have increased diuresis during sleep, which decreases with nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment. These changes have been attributed to an increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide in obstructive sleep apnoea, and its decrease with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 2. In order to clarify the change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, blood samples were taken at 10 min intervals from nine patients with obstructive sleep apnoea during two nights when the patients were either untreated or treated with continuous positive airway pressure. Polysomnographic monitoring, including transcutaneous oximetry, and measurement of oesophageal pressure were performed simultaneously. Plasma arginine vasopressin was also measured. 3. The plasma level of arginine vasopressin did not change. The level of atrial natriuretic peptide was high and exhibited secretion bursts in six out of the nine patients; it drastically decreased with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 4. Across the patients, the mean plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide was correlated with the degree of hypoxaemia and the degree of oesophageal pressure swings during the sleep apnoeas. 5. Within the patients, cross-correlation studies suggested that the atrial natriuretic peptide secretory bursts were related either to the oesophageal pressure swings or to the apnoea-related hypoxaemia. 6. We conclude that release of atrial natriuretic peptide decreases with continuous positive airway pressure treatment in those patients with obstructive sleep apnoea who have increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide before treatment. 
Mastoid surgery at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital 1986-1988. Eighty-three children between ages 0-12 years had mastoid surgery in the three year period 1986-88. The indications were acute mastoiditis (30 children), uncontrolled chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) (24 children), cholesteatoma (22 children) and a miscellaneous group (7 children). Forty-seven per cent of those with acute mastoiditis were under one year but the 27 per cent with cholesteatoma as the precipitating cause were 4-12 years. Twenty-three per cent had significant complications. Typmano-mastoid surgery was employed to resolve uncontrolled CSOM. Children were between 2-12 years and 62 per cent were below the 25th centile for weight. Seventy-nine per cent of the tympanic membrane grafts were successful. The children with cholesteatoma were between 3-12 years and 76 per cent were below the 25th centile for weight. Eight of them only presented after the onset of acute mastoiditis. One child had a definite congenital cholesteatoma. Only one had a pars flaccida origin of the cholesteatoma sac and only eight an origin from the postero-superior pars tensa. All had open cavity surgery. When the cavity was lined by temporalis fascia, healing was improved markedly. 
Cytotoxic activity in plasma from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The present study evaluates an assay of cytotoxic effect of plasma from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Plasma from 20 recently diagnosed ALS patients induced hemolysis of normal red blood cells with a significantly greater intensity than that of normal controls. After at least 1 month of treatment with prednisone and azathioprine, the hemolytic activity of ALS plasma was reduced but was still higher than that of control plasma. 
Longitudinal study of cerebral spinal fluid drainage in polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase in paraplegia associated with thoracic aortic cross-clamping. It has been hoped that pharmacologic prophylaxis in thoracic aortic cross-clamping may avert the unpredictable complication of spinal cord paraplegia, may avoid the mechanical difficulties associated with shunts, partial bypass, or monitoring devices, and may serve as a substitute for or as an adjunct to cerebral spinal fluid drainage. Toward this end 21 mongrel dogs were studied in four groups and underwent 60 minutes of thoracic aortic cross-clamping: group I, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping; group II, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and cerebral spinal fluid drainage; group III, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping, cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intravenous administration of a single dose (5000 units/kg) of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) given 15 to 20 minutes before thoracic aortic cross-clamping; and group IV, six with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and PEG-SOD. Paraplegia was graded by the Tarlov method at 24 hours and up to 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. The carotid and femoral artery pressures, the central venous pressure, and core temperature, taken during the experiment and at the time the dogs were killed, were found to be similar between groups. At 24 hours all dogs in group I were paraplegic; groups II and III had no paraplegic dogs (p less than 0.01), and group IV had fewer paraplegic dogs (two of six) than group I (p less than 0.05). Paraplegia was averted in all dogs treated with cerebral spinal fluid drainage, even 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. 
Adrenal pheochromocytoma presenting with persistent abdominal and flank pain. Pheochromocytoma is classically associated with paroxysms of headache and hypertension. Its presentation, however, may be more varied and subtle. We present a case of an adolescent female who complained of right upper quadrant and flank pain. A right adrenal pheochromocytoma was diagnosed and subsequently removed. The pertinent literature is discussed. 
Return of interdigestive motor complex after abdominal surgery. End of postoperative ileus? Gastrointestinal mechanical activity was studied in 13 patients after different surgical procedures in a fasted and fed state and after pharmacological stimulation. Mechanical activity was recorded by means of a multi-pressure sensor probe placed intraoperatively into the jejunum. Abdominal surgery abolished normal motility only for a short period of time. The time for the reappearance of regular recurring activity fronts varied with the type of the surgical procedure from 3 hr after cholecystectomy to the sixth postoperative day after colon resection. The fed pattern occurred after the first postoperative interdigestive motor complex in all experiments. Stimulation was observed with ceruletide, which induced contractile activity in the small intestine during postoperative ileus. No coordinated caudad propagating activity was observed. The postoperative interdigestive motor complex did not correlate in time with the first passage of flatus and stool in our patients. Thus, the restoration of motility in the small intestine did not coincide with the clinical relief from the so-called "physiological" postoperative ileus. 
Superior mesenteric artery syndrome in acute traumatic quadriplegia: case reports and literature review. Superior mesenteric artery syndrome is a condition in which the third portion of the duodenum is intermittently compressed by the overlying superior mesenteric artery, resulting in gastrointestinal obstruction. Predisposing factors include rapid weight loss, prolonged supine positioning, and using a spinal orthosis, all of which are common among acute traumatic quadriplegic patients. This paper presents three patients, aged 24, 16, and 20 years, with traumatic quadriplegia treated with supine positioning and cervical orthoses, who had postprandial nausea and emesis, bloating, and abdominal pain during rehabilitation. Upper gastrointestinal radiographic series demonstrated abrupt duodenal obstruction to barium flow in all three patients. Two of the patients had complete relief of symptoms with conservative management, and one required surgical duodenojejunostomy. Enhanced awareness of this condition may result in improved recognition of this disease as a cause of persistent, unexplained gastrointestinal disturbances in quadriplegic persons, thereby optimizing its treatment and reducing its potential morbidity. 
Significance of anti-phospholipid antibodies in patients with lupus nephritis. Anti-phospholipid antibodies (APA) as markers or mediators of thrombosis in lupus could be of pathogenetic significance in nephritis, since glomerular capillary thrombi are an indicator of subsequent renal dysfunction. Isotype specific APA antibodies were measured, using cardiolipin as the antigen, in 76 patients with lupus nephritis. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had elevated IgG APA. Overall, 43% of patients showed raised levels of at least one isotype. In general, APA had specificity for anionic phospholipids. In vitro lupus anticoagulant activity was associated with all three isotypes of APA, but only the IgM isotype correlated with the biological false positive test for syphilis. APA were not associated with thromboses or neurological involvement, and only the IgA isotype correlated with thrombocytopenia. We confirmed an association between the presence of intraglomerular thrombi and serum IgG APA. However, we found no association between APA and renal histological pattern, or long-term renal function. Our data, therefore, do not support a major pathogenetic role for APA in the nephritis of lupus in treated patients. 
Submaximal exercise thallium-201 SPECT for assessment of interventional therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Submaximal thallium-201 stress testing has been shown to provide important diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with acute myocardial infarction. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the diagnostic value of early submaximal stress testing and thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) after interventional therapy. Scintigraphic results from 56 patients with infarctions, who underwent acute thrombolytic therapy, angioplasty, or both, were compared with late (6 weeks) functional outcome as assessed by radionuclide ventriculography and with results of discharge coronary angiography. A linear correlation was found between the extent of thallium-201 SPECT perfusion defect and late ventricular function (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01). Forty-two percent of patients with large SPECT perfusion defects had normal left ventricular ejection fractions, suggesting an overestimation of infarct size by early imaging. Sensitivity and specificity of thallium-201 SPECT for detection of coronary artery stenosis in noninfarct territories was 57% and 46%, respectively, indicating limited diagnostic definition of extent of underlying coronary artery disease. Results of follow-up coronary angiography showed a significant relationship between the size of the initial perfusion defect and early restenosis or reocclusion of the infarct artery. Thus the extent of early thallium-201 perfusion defects correlates with late functional outcome but appears to overestimate the degree of injury. Submaximal thallium-201 stress testing allows only limited characterization of underlying coronary artery disease. Early assessment of infarct size may identify a patient population at high risk for reocclusion of the infarct artery. 
Intelligence at six years in relation to neonatal bilirubin levels: follow-up of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Clinical Trial of Phototherapy. Results of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Randomized Controlled Trial of Phototherapy were examined for the relationship of neonatal bilirubin level to neurological and developmental outcome at 6-year follow-up. This analysis focused on 224 control children with birth weight of less than 2000 g. Bilirubin levels were maintained below previously specified levels by the use of exchange transfusion only (24%). Rates of cerebral palsy were not significantly higher for children with elevated maximum bilirubin level than for those whose level remained low. No association was evident between maximum bilirubin level and IQ (Full Scale, Verbal, or Performance) by simple correlation analysis (r = -.087, P = .2 for Full Scale) or by multiple linear regression adjusting for factors that covary with IQ (beta = -.15, P = .58). IQ was not associated with mean bilirubin level, time and duration of exposure to bilirubin, or measures of bilirubin-albumin binding. Thus, over the range of bilirubin levels permitted in this clinical trial, there was no evidence of bilirubin toxicity to the central nervous system. Measures used to control the level of bilirubin in low birth weight neonates appear to prevent effectively the risk of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity. 
Inverted colonic diverticulum: air contrast barium enema findings in six cases. A polypoid elevation of the colonic wall was identified on air contrast barium enema in six patients. The abnormality in each case was found to be an inverted colonic diverticulum. Inverted diverticula appeared as broad-based, smooth, sessile polyps measuring 1.5-2.0 cm. In five of the six patients a characteristic central umbilication and/or evidence of barium within the polyp could be identified. The diagnosis was confirmed in three patients by demonstrating an everted diverticulum replacing the suspected lesion. In the remaining three patients, two of whom had normal findings on colonoscopy, the diagnosis was strongly suggested by the presence of barium extending into the substance of the mass. Additional radiologic maneuvers or a second study may permit accurate diagnosis if the possibility of inverted diverticulum is considered. However, even when the diverticulum cannot be demonstrated, a central umbilication or barium within a smooth intraluminal projection should suggest inverted diverticulum and prevent unnecessary endoscopy or inadvertent diverticulectomy. 
Persistent polyclonal B lymphocytosis with Epstein-Barr virus antibodies and subsequent malignant pulmonary blastoma. Persistent polyclonal B lymphocytosis (PPBL), a rare benign lymphoproliferative disorder, occurred in a 25 year old woman. The lymphocytes showed the phenotype cIgM+, FMC7+, CD19+, CD20+, which was similar to that seen in Waldenstrom's macroglobinaemia, but the proliferation was repeatedly shown to be polyclonal both immunologically and by immunoglobulin gene rearrangement studies. Eleven years after presentation the patient developed a malignant pulmonary blastoma, a rare pulmonary tumour of combined epithelial and mesenchymal origin. The failure to develop a lymphoid malignancy over 11 years together with immunological and genetic evidence of polyclonality confirms that PPBL is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder. The subsequent occurrence of a nonhaemopoietic malignancy suggests that benign lymphoid proliferations, like their malignant counterparts, may predispose to the development of neoplasia. A role for Epstein-Barr virus in the pathogenesis of one or both of these rare conditions is suggested by the finding of raised Epstein-Barr viral capsid antigen titres. 
Family history in patients with transient ischemic attacks. To determine the influence of family history on vascular disease, we surveyed hospital patients discharged with a diagnosis of transient ischemic attack. Of 117 respondents, 81 knew their family history for myocardial infarction and 81 knew their family history for stroke. Of 83 responding 43 reported a personal history of myocardial infarction, and of 85 responding 66 reported a personal history of stroke. As expected, there was an association between positive family and personal histories of myocardial infarction in younger (aged less than 70 years) patients (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.014). This association was reversed for stroke (Fisher's two-tailed exact test, p = 0.017). Older (aged greater than or equal to 70 years) patients had a stronger association between positive family and personal histories of stroke; 14 (74%) of 19 older patients with a positive personal history of stroke had a positive family history of stroke. The reason for this reversal in the relation between family and personal histories of stroke compared with myocardial infarction may relate to the older age at onset of most strokes, differing stroke subtypes in older age groups, or lower rates of fatal myocardial infarction. This study suggests that familial factors may be important in some subtypes of cerebrovascular disease. Familial effects may be different in vascular diseases of the heart and brain. 
Concomitant benefit of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreas fistula formation after pancreatoduodenectomy. Preoperative irradiation improves both the resectability and curability of carcinoma of the pancreas head area and should improve patient survival. We retrospectively investigated the value of preoperative irradiation in preventing pancreatic fistula formation. Of 76 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticojejunostomy by mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis with a stent catheter after pancreatoduodenectomy, 22 had received preoperative irradiation. The irradiation field included the anastomotic site. In two patients, accidental dislocation of the stent catheter was the apparent cause of fistula formation, but the other 21 patients in the irradiated group developed no fistula. In contrast, nine (17%) of 53 patients in the nonirradiated group developed fistulas. In the irradiated group, preoperative selenomethionine Se 75 scintigraphy revealed a cold area corresponding to the pancreas body, which was included in the irradiation field. Thus, a putative decrease in exocrine function at the pancreatic anastomotic site could explain why fistula formation was prevented by preoperative irradiation. 
Hypertension, cardiac disease, and compliance in minority patients. In minorities, as in the general population, hypertension is taken seriously because it is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Until recently, our understanding of the role that hypertension plays in the heart disease seen in minorities has been limited by a paucity of prospective data regarding the prevalence, natural history, and pathophysiology of the disease process in minority populations. In the last few years large-scale epidemiologic studies and well-controlled clinical studies alike have confirmed usually high rates of hypertension-related morbidity and mortality in minorities, particularly blacks and Hispanics. The severity of end-organ damage, both cardiac and renal, that is seen in these patients--especially when coupled with the severe cerebrovascular damage that is also more common in black and Hispanic hypertensives--mandate that more effective public health measures be taken to reduce the incidence of hypertension in these patient populations. Because hypertension is usually without significant clinical symptoms, noncompliance with drug therapy and high dropout rates are common in all patient populations. They are strikingly higher in inner-city populations, however, where illiteracy, poverty, homelessness, and high rates of chemical dependency combine to exacerbate an already serious problem in treating hypertensive patients. Inner-city patients are, increasingly, black and Hispanic patients, and these patients are more likely to be underinsured or uninsured, to be functionally illiterate in English, to be disinclined to seek health care, and to be less capable of following a prescribed regimen than the populace as a whole. The nature of the therapeutic regimen itself is probably the most important determinant of compliance, and compliance with drug therapy will be improved if the clinic chooses a simplified drug regimen and avoids drugs that produce intolerable side effects. Once-a-day--or, with transdermal clonidine, one-a-week--single-drug therapy may not be possible in all patients, but multiple drug therapy and multiple daily dosing schedules should be avoided wherever possible. 
Fetal death associated with measles virus infection of the placenta. A case of fetal death at 25 weeks' gestation, which was associated with maternal measles infection, is described. Immunohistochemical study revealed measles virus antigen in the syncytial trophoblastic cells and decidua but not in the fetus. Results suggest that fetal death was caused by measles virus infection in the placenta. As far as we know, this is the first report in which a measles virus antigen was detected in the placenta by the immunohistochemical method. 
Effect of mitral regurgitation on pulmonary venous velocities derived from transesophageal echocardiography color-guided pulsed Doppler imaging. The effect of mitral regurgitation on pulmonary venous flow velocity was studied in 66 patients undergoing transesophageal echocardiography. Nine patients were studied intraoperatively before and after surgery, so that 75 pulmonary venous flow tracings were analyzed. Fifty-four patients had no significant (0 to 1+) mitral regurgitation and 21 had significant (2 to 3+) mitral regurgitation. Comparison of both groups revealed significant differences in the pulmonary venous flow pattern. In patients with no significant mitral regurgitation, the peak systolic velocity was higher (55 +/- 16 vs. -4 +/- 16 cm/s; p less than 0.0001) and the peak diastolic velocity was lower (43 +/- 13 vs. 59 +/- 17 cm/s; p less than 0.01) when compared with values in patients with significant mitral regurgitation. Consequently, the peak systolic/diastolic velocity ratio was significantly higher in the patients without significant mitral regurgitation (1.4 +/- 0.5 vs. 0.4 +/- 1.3; p less than 0.0001). The same trend was noted with respect to the systolic and diastolic velocity integrals. As the degree of mitral regurgitation increased, the peak diastolic velocity and diastolic velocity integral increased, whereas the peak systolic velocity and systolic velocity integral decreased. In patients with severe mitral regurgitation, the systolic flow became reversed (retrograde). The sensitivity of reversed systolic flow for severe mitral regurgitation was 90% (9 of 10), the specificity was 100% (65 of 65), the positive predictive value was 100% (9 of 9), the negative predictive value was 98% (65 of 66) and the predictive accuracy was 99% (74 of 75). 
Role of extended aortoplasty related to the definition of coarctation of the aorta. One hundred thirty-nine patients underwent operation for coarctation of the aorta. Age ranged from 1 day to 21 years and weight, from 1.5 to 70.4 kg. Numerous methods of repair were used. The operative mortality was low (1.3%), and 17 patients (11.3%) died late. Recoarctation occurred in 13 patients (9.4%). We attempted to correlate mortality and recoarctation with the surgical procedure. A review of the literature revealed no classifications of coarctation that applied to the anatomical and pathological variations we found at the time of operation. Therefore, we devised a surgical classification to separate the various entities in the spectrum of coarctation: type I = primary coarctation; type II = coarctation with isthmus hypoplasia; and type III = coarctation with tubular hypoplasia involving the isthmus and segment between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries. Each of these types has subtypes: A = with ventricular septal defect and B = with other major cardiac defects. We believe that rather than labeling one procedure as "the procedure of choice," providing this classification will allow the surgeon to use a method of repair that is suited to the anatomical variation. 
Improvement of outcome for infants of birth weight under 1000 g. The Victorian Infant Collaborative Study Group. The two year outcome of extremely low birth-weight (ELBW) infants (birth weight 500 to 999 g), born in the state of Victoria over two distinct eras, 1979-80 and 1985-7, were compared. In the 1979-80 era, 25.4% of the ELBW infants survived to 2 years of age; only 12.5% of liveborn ELBW infants survived to 2 years with no neurological disabilities. In the 1979-80 era, ELBW infants born outside the level III centres in the state were significantly disadvantaged in both mortality and neurological morbidity. By 1985-7, the two year survival rate of ELBW infants rose significantly from 25.4% to 37.9%. By 1985-7, the proportion of ELBW infants who survived to 2 years free of neurological disabilities increased from 12.5% to 26.2%. Despite the improved survival, the absolute number of 2 year old children survivors with severe neurological disabilities remained constant at 8/year in both eras. By 1985-7, fewer ELBW infants were born outside the level III centres, their survival rate remained lower, but the severe neurological disability rate in survivors was no longer significantly higher. There has been a concomitant improvement in both survival and reduction in neurological morbidity. 
Comparison of accuracy of transesophageal versus transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of mitral valve prolapse with ruptured chordae tendineae (flail mitral leaflet). The accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography was compared with that of transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of ruptured chordae tendineae (flail mitral leaflet) in 27 patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) who underwent valve repair or replacement for mitral regurgitation. Confirmation of the presence of ruptured chordae resulting in a flail leaflet was available at surgery in all cases. The echocardiographic studies were read blindly by 2 independent observers with any differences resolved by a third. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 63 +/- 13 years. Men (n = 20) outnumbered women (n = 7) (p less than 0.02), and tended to be younger (p = 0.06). Flail leaflets were identified in 20 of 27 patients. In 1 patient, both leaflets were involved and in the remaining 19 patients posterior leaflets (15 patients) were more frequently affected than anterior leaflets (4 patients). Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified all 20 patients with flail leaflets, but 1 false positive study occurred among the 7 patients without a flail leaflet. In contrast, transthoracic echocardiography identified only 12 of 20 patients with flail leaflets, with no false positive studies. Transesophageal echocardiography was more accurate, correctly classifying 26 of 27 (96%) cases versus 19 of 27 (70%) by the transthoracic approach (p less than 0.01). This study suggests a higher incidence of chordal rupture to the posterior leaflet in patients with MVP and demonstrates improved accuracy of transesophageal over transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of flail leaflets. 
Effect of dietary nucleotides on intestinal repair in rats with experimental chronic diarrhea. Nucleic acid synthesis in tissues of rapid growth is preferentially done using dietary purines and pyrimidines via the salvage pathway. In the case of a low protein intake, dietary nucleotides may be semiessential for cell replication of gut, lymphocytes, and bone marrow, and especially in those intestinal diseases in which the mucosa is altered, dietary nucleotides may have a role in intestinal development. The effect of dietary nucleotides on intestinal weight and length, gut mucosal weight, intestinal protein and DNA contents, and lactase, maltase, and intestinal mucosal activities was assessed in a controlled way. Weanling (21-day-old) rats were separated into two groups of 36, each receiving blindly a basal diet containing glucose polymers (C) or a basal diet with lactose as the main carbohydrate (L) for 15 days. Those fed with L developed a syndrome of chronic diarrhea and malnutrition. Ten rats of each group were sacrificed at that time. The rest of the animals of each group were separated into two subgroups. The first was fed with the C diet and the second with the C diet supplemented with 50 mg/100 g of each of the following nucleotides: AMP, GMP, CMP, UMP, and IMP (CN). Thus the subgroups CC, CN, LC, and LN were formed. Rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks and gut separated into three segments corresponding to duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. Analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of diet or segments. DNA and lactase, maltase, and sucrase activities increased in the LN group with respect to LC especially in jejunum and ileum but there were not any differences between CC and CN. 
The interpretation of dysprosody in patients with Parkinson's disease. Prosodic features in the speech production of 21 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were tested. The appreciation of vocal and facial expression was also examined in the same patients. Significant intergroup differences were found in the prosody production tasks but, in contrast to previous results, not in the receptive tasks on the recognition and appreciation of prosody and of facial expression. The discrepancy between the production and recognition of prosodic features does not support the suggestion that dysprosody in Parkinson's disease is necessarily a disorder of processing emotional information that could be misinterpreted as a dysarthria. 
Quality of life in long-term survivors of CNS tumors of childhood and adolescence. Clinical reports of small numbers of pediatric brain tumor patients observed for brief periods suggest that long-term survivors continue to have major handicaps into adulthood. To quantify these late effects we interviewed 342 adults (or their proxies) who had CNS tumors diagnosed before the age of 20 between 1945 and 1974, survived at least 5 years, and reached 21 years of age. Survivors were 32 years old on average at follow-up. When compared with 479 matched siblings as controls. CNS tumor survivors were more likely to have died or to have become mentally incompetent sometime during the follow-up period. They were more likely to be at risk for such adverse outcomes as unemployment (odds ratio [OR], 10.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.6 to 25.7], to have a health condition that affected their ability to work (OR, 5.9; CI, 3.7 to 9.4), to be unable to drive (OR, 28.8; CI, 6.9 to 119.9), or to describe their current health as poor (OR, 7.8; CI, 1.7 to 35.7). Unfavorable outcomes were more frequent in male survivors than in females, in those with supratentorial tumors compared with infratentorial ones, and in those who received radiation therapy. As clinicians consider improving therapies, they should anticipate late effects, such as those we observed, and attempt to target subgroups for interventions that may improve subsequent quality of life. 
Verapamil and migraine prophylaxis: mechanisms and efficacy. Calcium channel blockers have demonstrated efficacy in investigative use for prophylaxis of migraine and cluster headaches. In particular, verapamil, with its low side-effect profile, appears to be a promising alternative to the currently available agents for prophylactic treatment of chronic recurring headaches. Although its exact mechanisms of action in this application are unknown, verapamil exerts a vasodilatory effect on cerebral arteries and interacts with serotonergic systems involved in migraine pathogenesis. A review of studies from the past decade indicates that verapamil may be as effective as traditional therapies as prophylaxis for the major types of chronic recurring headache. 
Relation of cellular drug resistance to long-term clinical outcome in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The clinical relevance of cellular drug resistance in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is unknown. The relation between in-vitro sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs at initial diagnosis and long-term clinical outcome was investigated in 44 children with ALL. The short-term MTT assay was used to assess sensitivity to prednisolone, vincristine, colaspase (asparaginase), daunorubicin, and thioguanine (instead of mercaptopurine which is unstable in vitro). For vincristine and colaspase there was no difference in outcome (probability of continuous complete remission) between sensitive and resistant patients. However, the probability of continuous complete remission was significantly lower in patients with resistant cells than in those with sensitive cells for thioguanine (p less than 0.01), daunorubicin (p less than 0.02), and prednisolone (p less than 0.05). For prednisolone there was a significant worsening of the prognosis (p less than 0.05) from the extremely sensitive patients through an intermediate group to the most resistant group. The prognostic significance of cellular drug resistance was independent of white-blood-cell count, age, sex, and hepatosplenomegaly. Leukaemic cells from boys were more resistant to thioguanine than those from girls. Thus, the short-term highly efficient MTT assay can help to predict long-term response to chemotherapy in childhood ALL. 
Rationale for a primary prevention study using low-dose aspirin to prevent coronary and cerebrovascular disease in the elderly. The benefits of prophylactic aspirin therapy to prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in asymptomatic individuals remains unclear. The rationale for developing a multicentered, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to determine whether low-dose aspirin (100 mg daily) prevents cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in persons aged 70 years and over with no evidence of pre-existing cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease is described. Sample size calculations have indicated that 15,000 subjects would be required over a 4-year follow-up period in order to demonstrate a 20% reduction in overall cardiovascular mortality at the 0.01 level with a power of 0.8. Such a large-scale community-based clinical trial has never been conducted in Australia in this age group. Therefore the PACE (prevention by low-dose aspirin of cardiovascular disease in the elderly) pilot study has been developed to test recruitment strategies and methods and ascertaining disease end-points. 
Myeloablative chemoradiotherapy and autologous bone marrow infusions for treatment of neuroblastoma: factors influencing engraftment. Bone marrow harvested from cancer patients for autologous bone marrow reinfusion (ABMR) after myeloablative treatment may be injured, in both its proliferating and stromal cell pools, by either previous treatment or manipulation at the time of harvest. We have examined the relative effects of seven covariates on hematologic recovery after ABMR in children with neuroblastoma (NBL) using univariate and step-up analysis. We measured recovery by times to achieve (1) white blood cell counts greater than 1,000/microL; (2) absolute neutrophil counts greater than 500/microL; and (3) platelet counts greater than 20,000/microL without transfusion. In univariate analysis, recovery was significantly associated with the amount of prior chemotherapy and the interval between last chemotherapy and marrow harvest. Patient sex, the number of granulocyte-macrophage colonies infused, harvest-to-freeze interval, and use of purging were marginally associated. After adjusting for potential confounders in a multivariate model, the amounts of chemotherapy and granulocyte-macrophage colonies infused were independently significant predictors of time to total white blood cell count recovery; chemotherapy courses and chemo-to-harvest interval were predictors of neutrophil count recovery; and sex, use of purging, and harvest-to-freeze interval were marginal predictors of platelet recovery. The speed of hematologic recovery after ABMR seems to depend mainly on pre-existing factors and marginally on manipulation of the marrow after harvest. These factors may affect both proliferating and stromal cell pools. 
Golf for the mature athlete. Golf is a different sport from all others discussed in this issue in one important aspect: Almost all of its practitioners play more, rather than less, as they mature. A great many of them play better, too. This additional play and skill can be highly satisfying to the participants; however, it puts them at risk for a number of overuse syndromes directly caused by the motion requirements of golf. In addition, the repetitive nature of the activity can exacerbate pre-existing and age-related orthopedic pathology as well. There is no substitute for attention to the preplay aspects of golf (warm-up, flexibility, and strengthening). 
Treatment of acute cluster headache with sumatriptan. The Sumatriptan Cluster Headache Study Group BACKGROUND. Attacks of cluster headache are difficult to treat. Sumatriptan, an agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine1-like receptors, has proved effective in the treatment of migraine. The clinical similarities between migraine and cluster headache and positive results from an open pilot study in patients with cluster headache indicated that sumatriptan should be evaluated more rigorously in the treatment of this condition. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan in 49 patients with cluster headache. The patients received, in random order, a subcutaneous injection of 6 mg of sumatriptan for one cluster-headache attack and placebo for another attack. The results for the two attacks could be fully evaluated for 39 patients. A response to treatment was defined as complete or almost complete relief of headache (no pain or mild pain) within 15 minutes after the injection. RESULTS. In the 39 patients, the severity of headache decreased in 74 percent of the attacks within 15 minutes of treatment with sumatriptan, as compared with 26 percent of the attacks for which placebo was given (P less than 0.001). Thirty-six percent of the patients were free of pain within 10 minutes after the administration of sumatriptan, as compared with 3 percent after placebo (P less than 0.001); by 15 minutes these numbers had increased to 46 percent and 10 percent, respectively (P less than 0.001). Thirteen percent of the patients required oxygen as an additional treatment 15 minutes after receiving sumatriptan, as compared with 49 percent of those who received placebo. The severity of functional disability and the incidence of ipsilateral conjunctival injection also decreased more in response to sumatriptan than placebo. Sumatriptan was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS. Sumatriptan is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for acute attacks of cluster headache. 
An overview of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. This symposium reviewed the risk factors and problems associated with venous thromboembolism in surgical patients, especially those patients having total hip replacement. The importance of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis was emphasized by a theoretical analysis indicating that venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement not only saves lives but is also effective. A discussion of the pharmacology of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) included a review of its role, clinically and experimentally, in venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. Three of the discussants presented their favorable experiences with LMWH in reducing the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement. It can be concluded that LMWH does reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism in patients having hip replacement without causing an increase in blood loss. If its effectiveness and safety remain substantiated, LMWH may soon become the preferred agent for venous thromboembolism prophylaxis. 
Sexual headaches: case report, review, and treatment with calcium blocker. A case is reported in which a patient with sexual and orgasmic headaches was treated successfully with a calcium channel blocker, diltiazem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of successful treatment of sexual headaches with calcium channel blockers reported in the English medical literature. The literature on sexually related headaches is reviewed, and classification, evaluation, differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, and treatment of sexual headaches are discussed. 
Natural history of isolated atrial flutter in infancy. To clarify the natural history of isolated (i.e., without associated congenital cardiac anomalies) atrial flutter in infancy, we reviewed the clinical course in nine patients who were seen with this arrhythmia in the first year of life (range 1 day to 4 months). Atrial flutter was identified by the typical sawtooth pattern in leads II, III, and aVF of the surface electrocardiogram or the pattern of atrial flutter on an atrial electrogram recorded through the esophagus. The mean cycle length of the atrial flutter was 151 msec (atrial rate 397 beats/min). Six of the nine patients had other perinatal problems, such as immune and nonimmune hydrops fetalis (two patients), pneumonia (one patient), anemia (five patients), or low birth weight (one patient). In all patients the rhythm reverted to normal, either spontaneously (two patients), with overdrive pacing (four patients), or after oral digoxin therapy (three patients). No consistent temporal relationship between digoxin administration and conversion was observed; conversion was instantaneous in the four patients who received atrial overdrive pacing. Four patients were discharged receiving digoxin therapy (6 months to 1 year). One patient had supraventricular tachycardia after discharge that was controlled with digoxin. No recurrence of atrial flutter was observed among the nine patients during a mean follow-up of 6.8 years (range 0.2 to 20 years). We conclude that isolated atrial flutter in infancy is rare, has a good prognosis, may be related to transient perinatal events, and often spontaneously converts to normal sinus rhythm; however, when it does not, it will respond to transesophageal pacing. Acute and chronic digoxin therapy is probably unnecessary. 
Induced hypertension during restoration of flow after temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat: effect on neuronal injury and edema. The effect of hypertension instituted during restoration of flow after focal ischemia was studied. After the middle cerebral artery (MCA) of 12 rats was occluded for 2 hours, the ligatures were released and flow was restored for a period of 2 hours. In the control group, mean arterial pressure (MAP) was not manipulated. In the hypertensive group, the MAP was elevated by 25-30 mm Hg immediately after reestablishment of MCA patency. The area of neuronal injury, determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium staining, was significantly smaller in the hypertensive group. Specific gravity, determined by microgravimetry, did not differ between groups. The data demonstrate that modest hypertension, when induced during reperfusion after 2 hours of MCA occlusion, reduces neuronal injury and does not exacerbate edema formation. 
Introduction: physiologic adaptations to exercise training in cardiac patients: contemporary issues and concerns. This symposium dealt with contemporary issues and concerns in cardiac rehabilitation. Selected topics included: the potential of exercise training to enhance coronary collateral circulation; safety and efficacy of high intensity training; influence of beta-blocking agents on exercise prescription and trainability; value of physical conditioning in patients with left ventricular dysfunction or cardiac transplantation; and the effect of exercise on serum lipids and lipoproteins. Each article attempted to assimilate the physiologically germane literature in an area and provide the reader with associated clinical and practical implications. 
Malignant schwannoma associated with xeroderma pigmentosum in a patient belonging to complementation group D. A 43-year-old man with xeroderma pigmentosum, XP97TO, was allocated to complementation group D. He had had moderate photosensitivity at age 1 year and freckles by age 6 but no neurologic abnormalities. Nevertheless, his fibroblasts in culture had the XP-D phenotype. They showed a sevenfold hypersensitivity to killing by 254 nm ultraviolet radiation and a diminished level (29%) of unscheduled DNA synthesis. Phototesting revealed delayed maximum erythema at 72 hours after UVB exposure and a lowered minimal erythema dose. Lentigo maligna developed on the patient's face, and a rapidly growing malignant schwannoma was found on the left trigeminal nerve. This may be the first case of a peripheral nervous tissue neoplasm in xeroderma pigmentosum. 
Symptomatic Chiari malformation in adults: a new classification based on magnetic resonance imaging with clinical and prognostic significance. Thirty-five consecutive adults with Chiari malformation and progressive symptoms underwent surgical treatment at a single institution over a 3-year period. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging scan before and after surgery. Images of the craniovertebral junction confirmed tonsillar herniation in all cases and allowed the definition of two anatomically distinct categories of the Chiari malformation in this age group. Twenty of the 35 patients had concomitant syringomyelia and were classified as Type A. The remaining 15 patients had evidence of frank herniation of the brain stem below the foramen magnum without evidence of syringomyelia and were labeled Type B. Type A patients had a predominant central cord symptomatology; Type B patients exhibited signs and symptoms of brain stem or cerebellar compression. The principal surgical procedure consisted of decompression of the foramen magnum, opening of the fourth ventricular outlet, and plugging of the obex. Significant improvement in preoperative symptoms and signs was observed in 9 of the 20 patients (45%) with syringomyelia (Type A), as compared to 13 of the 15 patients (87%) without syringomyelia (Type B). Postoperative reduction in syrinx volume was observed in 11 of the 20 patients with syringomyelia, including all 9 patients with excellent results. Magnetic resonance imaging has allowed a classification of the adult Chiari malformation in adults based on objective anatomic criteria, with clinical and prognostic relevance. The presence of syringomyelia implies a less favorable response to surgical intervention. 
Combination thrombolytic therapy: a comparison of simultaneous and sequential regimens of tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase. Coronary angioplasty following unsuccessful tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy for acute myocardial infarction has been associated with a high incidence of subsequent reocclusion of the infarct-related artery, and a relatively high in-hospital mortality. In contrast, the combination of t-PA and urokinase, when given intravenously prior to coronary angiography, appears to be associated with a low incidence of post-rescue angioplasty reocclusion. In order to determine whether intraprocedural urokinase, given at the time of rescue coronary angioplasty for failed t-PA therapy, improves long-term patency of the infarct vessel to the same extent as preangiographic, combination t-PA/urokinase therapy, three thrombolytic treatment strategies were retrospectively compared. The first group included 86 patients undergoing rescue angioplasty after t-PA monotherapy (t-PA alone). The clinical and angiographic outcomes of these patients were compared with those of 24 patients who received intravenous or intracoronary urokinase during rescue angioplasty following unsuccessful t-PA therapy (sequential t-PA/urokinase therapy), and with those of 34 patients undergoing rescue coronary angioplasty following unsuccessful therapy with the combination of intravenous t-PA and urokinase (simultaneous therapy). There was no difference in postangioplasty patency rate of the infarct-related artery between the three groups. However, the sequential t-PA/urokinase regimen was associated with a subsequent reocclusion rate that was lower than the rate that occurred in the t-PA monotherapy group but higher than the rate in the simultaneous t-PA/urokinase group (13 versus 29 versus 2%, respectively; p = 0.003). 
Atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli in stroke patients. In 539 consecutive stroke patients admitted to a rehabilitation department, we studied the possible role of atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism by analyzing a series of relevant clinical data in patients with and without atrial fibrillation and in patients with and without venous thromboembolic complications. Deep venous thrombosis as well as advanced age and cardiac disease were significantly (p less than 0.001) more frequent in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, in a model of simultaneous logistic regression carried out on the presence of absence of venous thromboembolic complications, atrial fibrillation was the only significant risk factor. In view of the morbidity and mortality linked to deep venous thrombosis, our findings argue for preventive anticoagulation therapy in stroke patients suffering from atrial fibrillation and merit further study. 
Large mediastinal mass secondary to an aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass graft aneurysm. A case of a 62-year-old man with a large mediastinal mass who had undergone aortocoronary bypass grafting 17 years earlier is presented. Computed tomography showed a 13-cm extrinsic cystic mass believed to represent a pericardial cyst or teratoma. Intraoperatively, the patient was noted to have an aneurysm of his right coronary artery bypass graft. We were able to find 4 other cases seen in this manner. 
Replacement of cholesterol gallstones by murideoxycholyl taurine gallstones in prairie dogs fed murideoxycholic acid. The effect of two hydrophilic bile acids, murideoxycholic acid (3 alpha,6 beta-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid) and ursodeoxycholic acid, on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism and hepatic pathology and gallstone composition was studied in the prairie dog. Cholesterol gallstones were induced by feeding a diet containing 1.2% cholesterol for 75 days. The animals were divided into six groups, and gallstone regression was studied as follows: groups 2 and 5, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol; groups 3 and 6, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol plus 0.15% ursodeoxycholic acid; groups 4 and 7, chow plus 0.2% cholesterol plus 0.15% murideoxycholic acid. Animals in groups 2 to 4 were killed after an additional 6 wk; animals in groups 5 to 7 were killed after an additional 12 wk. Gallstone dissolution did not occur in any group. The gallstones in groups 2, 3, 5 and 6 were typical cholesterol aggregates, as determined by polarized light microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The gallstones of the murideoxycholic acid group were large, solitary, dark stones that appeared radiopaque under 22 kVp x-ray examination. Scanning electron microscopy showed that in these stones the cholesterol crystals had been replaced by an amorphous material, both within the stone and on the stone surface. Chemical analysis indicated that at the end of 12 wk the calcium/sodium salt of the taurine conjugate of murideoxycholic acid (murideoxycholyl taurine) comprised 70% of the stones; protein, cholesterol and small amounts of other bile salts were also present. In vitro studies confirmed the insolubility of the sodium and calcium salts of murideoxycholyl taurine. These studies indicate that the hydrophilic bile acids, murideoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid, did not achieve gallstone dissolution under the conditions used. In the animals fed murideoxycholic acid, an insoluble calcium salt of murideoxycholyl taurine replaced cholesterol as the major constituent of gallbladder stones. This is the first example of an insoluble dihydroxy taurine-conjugated bile acid; administration of the unconjugated bile acid induced precipitation of a kind of gallstone not previously reported. The final result was transformation of cholesterol stones to bile salt stones. 
Functional evaluation following microvascular oromandibular reconstruction of the oral cancer patient: a comparative study of reconstructed and nonreconstructed patients. Over the past decade, the use of free flap transfers in head and neck surgery has led to remarkable advances in the reliability and the ultimate results of oromandibular reconstruction. Stable and retentive dental restorations have been achieved using enosseous implants placed directly into the vascularized bone flaps. However, the functional assessment of patients who underwent primary mandibular reconstruction with these techniques has not been previously reported. A group of 10 reconstructed and 10 nonreconstructed segmental hemimandibulectomy patients were compared using a battery of tests to assess their overall well-being, cosmesis, deglutition, oral competence, speech, length of hospitalization, and dental rehabilitation. In addition, objective measures of the masticatory apparatus (interincisal opening, bite force, chewing performance, and chewing stroke) were used to compare these two groups as well as normal healthy subjects and edentulous patients restored with conventional and implant-borne dentures. The results show a clear advantage for the reconstructed patients in almost all categories. Persistent problems and future directions in oromandibular reconstruction are discussed. 
In vitro study of the interaction of doxorubicin, thiotepa, and mitomycin-C, agents used for intravesical chemotherapy of superficial bladder cancer. Several cytotoxic agents have been identified as effective in the treatment of superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, including doxorubicin, thiotepa and mitomycin-C. An in vitro study was conducted to assess the interactions of these three drugs against a well differentiated human bladder tumor cell line, RT-4, to identify and evaluate synergistic combinations among these agents. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by a colorimetric assay based on the capacity of viable cells to metabolize a tetrazolium dye, MTT, to produce a colored formazan product. The analyses of drug interactions were done by the isobolographic method (construction of isoeffect plots). The combination of doxorubicin and thiotepa was found to be the most synergistic, followed by the combination of doxorubicin and mitomycin-C. The combination of mitomycin C and thiotepa demonstrated an unpredictable effect. These findings suggest the combination of doxorubicin and thiotepa has potential advantage for chemotherapy of superficial bladder tumors. 
Is fetal cellular rhabdomyoma an entity or a differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma? A study of patients with rhabdomyoma of the tongue and sarcoma of the tongue enrolled in the intergroup rhabdomyosarcoma studies I, II, and III. A tumor of the tongue with features consistent with the diagnosis of fetal cellular rhabdomyoma was seen in an 18-month-old infant. The tumor recurred 10 and 22 months after initial resection. The histologic condition of the first recurrence was similar to the original tumor except for some increased nuclear irregularities and mitotic activity. No adjunctive therapy was administered initially or after the first recurrence. The second recurrence showed mixed embryonal/alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. This case represented a unique model of a highly differentiated striated muscle tumor converting to a moderately differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma, and illustrated differential diagnostic difficulties in distinguishing between fetal cellular rhabdomyoma and differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient was compared with eight children and adolescents with primary sarcomas of the tongue who entered the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies (IRS) I, II, and III protocols. The tumors of all eight arose at the base of the tongue. There were five embryonal, one alveolar, and one mixed embryonal/alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas, and one undifferentiated myxoid sarcoma. Five rhabdomyosarcomas were poorly differentiated, and two had a moderate degree of myogenesis. These sarcomas of the tongue represent approximately 0.34% of all cases entered in IRS studies. 
Allograft prosthetic composite arthroplasty for osteosarcoma and other aggressive bone tumors. Allograft prosthetic composite arthroplasty is a reconstruction alternative after limb salvage for aggressive bone tumors. It combines an off-the-shelf implant with a fresh-frozen allograft and has several potential advantages over conventional techniques. Good clinical results can be achieved with acceptable morbidity. The procedure can be performed successfully even in patients receiving chemotherapy. Nonunion was the most common complication encountered but was amenable to autogenous iliac bone graft. The procedure can be customized to meet the needs of the patient, making custom implant manufacturing delay and expense unnecessary. 
Group C streptococcal bacteremia: analysis of 88 cases. Eighty-eight cases of group C streptococcal bacteremia were reviewed retrospectively. Most patients had underlying diseases (72.7%), predominantly cardiovascular disease (20.5%) or malignancy (20.5%). The infection originated most often from the upper respiratory tract (20.5%), the gastrointestinal tract (18.2%), or the skin (17.1%). Prior exposure to animals or animal products was reported in 23.9% of cases. The most common clinical manifestations of group C streptococcal bacteremia were endocarditis (27.3%), primary bacteremia (22.7%), and meningitis (10.2%). Of streptococcal isolates, 61.4% were not speciated, 19.3% were Streptococcus equisimilis, 17.1% were Streptococcus zooepidemicus, and two (2.3%) were Streptococcus equi. The isolates were sensitive to most antibiotics, and most patients were treated with beta-lactam agents. Mortality was high (25.0%), especially among older patients and patients with endocarditis, meningitis, and disseminated infection. Group C streptococcal bacteremia does not differ from bloodstream infection caused by other beta-hemolytic streptococci with regard to clinical presentation, treatment, or outcome. 
Thermal laser-assisted balloon angioplasty of the superficial femoral artery: a multicenter review of 602 cases. A multicenter review of 602 procedures was performed to evaluate the effects of thermal laser-assisted balloon angioplasty on the superficial femoral artery. Four hundred thirty-nine (73%) patients underwent laser-assisted balloon angioplasty for claudication, and 163 (27%) underwent the procedure for limb salvage. Two hundred ninety-two laser-assisted balloon angioplasty procedures were performed for multifocal stenotic disease (greater than 80%) diameter reduction), 258 for total occlusion, and 52 procedures for both superficial femoral artery stenosis and occlusion. The initial recanalization rate was 89% (538/602) depending on the length of the lesion. Success of laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was verified by angioscopy or arteriography, and all patients underwent segmental Doppler studies before discharge and during midterm follow-up extending to 30 months (mean, 11.3 months). Complications occurred in 62 (10%) patients, but only one limb amputation occurred because of a complication related to a laser-assisted balloon angioplasty. Overall, 60% of initially successful procedures have remained patent, but long segment (greater than 7 cm) occlusions have fared poorly (25% patency at 30 months). This minimally invasive technology affords the opportunity to treat short segment (less than 7 cm) symptomatic superficial femoral artery occlusive disease with minimal risk. Initial success and midterm patency rates for appropriate lesions appear to make laser-assisted balloon angioplasty a viable adjunct in the treatment of superficial femoral artery occlusive disease. 
Acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors induced by interleukin-1 alpha: effects independent of tumor necrosis factor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein synthesized in response to the endotoxin bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is the classical mediator of acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. We have demonstrated that interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), with a spectrum of activities very similar to those of TNF, also causes acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. Both TNF and IL-1 induce a cascade of events including the synthesis or release of each other. The present studies were thus undertaken to determine whether the hemorrhagic necrosis induced in tumors by IL-1 alpha is due to TNF. Kinetic parameters of IL-1 alpha-induced hemorrhage were similar to those observed with recombinant murine TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha) or LPS in RIF-1 fibrosarcomas in C3H/HeN (endotoxin-sensitive) mice. However, the amount of TNF found in the sera or tumors of animals treated with LPS was more than 20-fold higher than in mice treated with IL-1 alpha, and LPS induced similar degrees of hemorrhagic necrosis, which was measured by determining the packed volume of red blood cells by 59Fe labeling. A low but significantly hemorrhagic dose of IL-1 alpha induced no detectable TNF in tumors. Pretreatment with 250 micrograms of neutralizing antibody to TNF had no effect on IL-1 alpha-induced hemorrhage, whereas TNF-alpha- and LPS-induced hemorrhagic effects were significantly reduced. These results demonstrate an important antitumor activity of IL-1 alpha that appears to be independent of TNF. 
Estrogen and progesterone binding by acoustic neuroma tissue. Tissue samples from 37 acoustic neuromas were assayed for estrogen and progesterone hormone receptor binding by radioimmunoassay using a dextran-coated charcoal method and Scatchard plot analysis. Twenty-one of the samples were from men, and 16 of the samples were from women. Seven of 37 samples (19%) were positive for estrogen receptor and six of 36 samples (17%) were positive for progesterone receptor. Three of 37 samples (8%) were positive for both receptors. There was no correlation of estrogen receptor positivity with the sex of the patient. These results indicate that estrogen or progesterone receptor binding activity or both are present in a small subset of acoustic tumors. Evidence is lacking, however, that binding of estrogen to the receptor results in growth changes in the tumor. The empirical use of antiestrogen treatment in acoustic neuroma does not appear to be justified at the present time. 
Nontraumatic surgical emergencies in children. Clinical conditions that require operative intervention are frequent causes of emergency department visits. Common causes such as pyloric stenosis, intussusception, inguinal hernias, torsion of the testicle, and ingested foreign bodies are discussed, and aids in diagnosis and early intervention are addressed. Conditions that mimic surgical problems also are mentioned.
