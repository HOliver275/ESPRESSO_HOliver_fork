Reversible operculum syndrome caused by progressive epilepsia partialis continua in a child with left hemimegalencephaly. In a child with left hemimegalencephaly and seizures, a reversible operculum syndrome developed when continuous epileptic discharges spread from the left hemisphere to the contralateral central regions. The operculum syndrome lasted for three months until left hemispherectomy was performed. Soon after surgery the seizures and the operculum syndrome resolved. The operculum syndrome is a facio-pharyngo-glosso-masticatory diplegia usually due to structural lesions in both opercular regions. The reversibility of the syndrome in the reported case demonstrates that the operculum syndrome is sometimes functional rather than lesional. 
Ceftriaxone-associated gallbladder sludge. Identification of calcium-ceftriaxone salt as a major component of gallbladder precipitate Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, is partially excreted into bile. With its clinical use, the formation of gallbladder sludge detected by ultrasonography has been reported. Four surgical specimens were examined and no gallstones were found. Instead, fine precipitates of 20-250 microns were present. Microscopically, there was a small number of cholesterol monohydrate crystals and bilirubin granules among an abundant amount of granular-crystalline material that was not morphologically cholesterol monohydrate crystals. The chemical composition of the precipitates (n = 4) was determined. There was a small amount of cholesterol (1.7% +/- 0.8%) and bilirubin (13.9% +/- 0.74%). The major component of the precipitate was a residue. On further analysis using thin-layer chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and electron microprobe analysis, the residue was identified as a calcium salt of ceftriaxone. The residue also had identical crystal morphology and chromatographic elution profile as authentic calcium-ceftriaxone standards. It is concluded that ceftriaxone, after excretion and being concentrated in the gallbladder bile, can form a precipitate. The major constituent has been identified as a ceftriaxone-calcium salt. 
Distal transfer of the greater trochanter. After congenital dislocation of the hip, Perthes' disease and some other conditions, the femoral neck may be short and the greater trochanter in a relatively proximal position. Distal transfer of the greater trochanter is an effective and relatively simple operation to correct this deformity. We have reviewed 26 patients (27 hips) at a mean follow-up of eight years. Pain relief and improvement in gait were maintained in 74%, and the poor results were largely due to progression of osteoarthritis. We describe a 'gear-stick' sign of trochanteric impingement, which is useful in the pre-operative assessment of patients. 
Surgical treatment of carcinoma of the gastric stump. To evaluate retrospectively the surgical treatment of patients with gastric stump cancer following gastrectomy for benign disease, we reviewed 52 patients operated on at the National Cancer Centre, Tokyo, between 1962 and 1988. Resection was carried out in 47 patients (90 per cent) and with curative intent in 36 (69 per cent). Stage distribution was: stage 1, 15 patients; stage 2, 5; stage 3, 9; stage 4, 23. In 36 cases curatively resected, 32 had completion total gastrectomy and four had subtotal resection. An R1 resection was performed in 11 patients and an R2 in 25. We had two hospital deaths and a 5-year survival rate excluding hospital deaths of 39 per cent. The 5-year survival rates of resected cases, curative cases and those having metastatic nodes were 43 per cent, 57 per cent and 29 per cent respectively. Radical resection is a reasonable treatment for gastric stump cancer as it is for primary cancer of the stomach. 
The activity of 22-oxacalcitriol in osteoblast-like (ROS 17/2.8) cells. 22-Oxacalcitriol (OCT), a synthetic vitamin D analog, can mimic the ability of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3[1,25-(OH)2D3] to differentiate leukemia and skin cells, to enhance the immune response and to suppress PTH secretion, but has much less calcemic activity. The mechanism for this selective action is not understood. OCT has been shown to have a diminished ability to mobilize calcium from bone in vivo, but in vitro findings are contradictory. Little is known about the effect of OCT on bone forming cells. Therefore, the present studies were designed to investigate the actions of OCT at the molecular level in the osteoblast-like cell line, ROS 17/2.8. 3H-OCT was bound to the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in intact cells at the same rate as 3H-1,25-(OH)2D3. As previously found for 1,25-(OH)2D3, the time course of specific binding of OCT was biphasic, with an initial plateau at 1 h and a further increase from 2-8 h. Scatchard analysis demonstrated that exposure to 3H-1,25-(OH)2D3 increased VDR from 24 fmol/mg protein at 2 h to 85 fmol/mg protein at 8 h. Exposure to 3H-OCT increased VDR from 22 to 76 fmol/mg protein, indicating that OCT is also capable of up-regulating the VDR in ROS 17/2.8 cells. In contrast to the lower affinity of OCT for VDR reported for chick intestine and HL-60 cells, the Kd for OCT in intact ROS 17/2.8 cells was identical to that for 1,25-(OH)2D3. The effect of OCT on osteocalcin secretion and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells was also determined. Pretreatment for 24 h with either 1,25-(OH)2D3 or OCT resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of osteocalcin secretion. A 2-fold stimulation by both compounds was observed with 10(-7)M. ALP activity was measured after a 72-h incubation with 10(-7)M 1,25-(OH)2D3 or OCT. Both compounds increased ALP activity to the same extent. Stimulation by OCT of VDR levels, ALP activity, and osteocalcin secretion were inhibited by the addition of 5 microM cycloheximide, indicating that these actions of OCT require new protein synthesis. Thus, OCT, like 1,25-(OH)2D3, up-regulates the vitamin D receptor, stimulates osteocalcin secretion, and increases ALP activity in ROS 17/2.8 cells, suggesting that the analog may be as active as 1,25-(OH)2D3 in stimulating bone formation in vivo. The low activity of OCT in mobilizing calcium from bone in vivo does not appear to be due to an inability of this compound to act on osteoblasts. 
Neuropsychologic test performance in amateur boxers. Cognitive functions of 23 amateur boxers were assessed immediately before and after an amateur boxing event. A range of cognitive measures were employed including tasks of verbal, figural, and incidental memory, motor functions, attention and concentration, and information processing speed. Compared to their prefight performance, boxers demonstrated impairments in verbal and incidental memory, but enhanced executive and motor functions postfight. There were no observed differences between winners and losers on any of the measures. The results are compared to other studies that have shown only minor changes in cognitive functions in amateur boxers compared to controls. 
Headaches due to cerebrovascular disease. Subarachnoid hemorrhage causes sudden, severe headache and requires immediate medical and surgical diagnosis and treatment. A CT scan is the first choice for correct diagnosis. In order to prevent rebleeding, delays in treatment should be avoided. Intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhage is now often recognized by means of CT scanning and sometimes is a cause of headache. Cerebellar hemorrhage commonly causes occipital headache and is an indication for immediate surgical intervention, although small cerebellar hemorrhages can be treated conservatively. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is frequently accompanied by headache, but its etiology remains uncertain. Thrombosis of the cerebrovenous system is a less frequent cause of head pain than that of the arterial system, but it usually shows characteristic neurologic signs. Following carotid endarterectomy or superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery bypass surgery, the patient may have moderate to severe unilateral headaches, probably as a result of platelet aggregation and serotonin release. 
Enterococcal meningitis in an HIV positive haemophilic patient. A 25 year old, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositive, severe haemophilic patient was treated for suspected Pneumocystis carinii infection with high dose intravenous cotrimoxazole and subsequently with prednisolone. When he improved he was discharged on oral treatment only to return two days later, extremely unwell, with headaches, fever, sweats, tachycardia and hypotension. A lumbar puncture showed modest neutrophil pleocytosis but despite empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous benzylpenicillin and cefuroxime he continued to deteriorate. Culture of cerebrospinal fluid subsequently grew Enterococcus faecalis that was resistant to trimethoprim and sensitive to ampicillin, rifampicin, and vancomycin. After a change in treatment to intravenous ampicillin and rifampicin he dramatically improved. Enterococcal meningitis is rare in adults but important to recognise and treat appropriately in view of its high mortality and relative resistance to antibiotics. In our case the combination of HIV infection and previous treatment with antibiotics or steroids, or both, were probable predisposing factors. 
By how much does dietary salt reduction lower blood pressure? III--Analysis of data from trials of salt reduction [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Apr 20;302(6782):939] OBJECTIVE--To determine whether the reduction in blood pressure achieved in trials of dietary salt reduction is quantitatively consistent with estimates derived from blood pressure and sodium intake in different populations, and, if so, to estimate the impact of reducing dietary salt on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease. DESIGN--Analysis of the results of 68 crossover trials and 10 randomised controlled trials of dietary salt reduction. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Comparison of observed reductions in systolic blood pressure for each trial with predicted values calculated from between population analysis. RESULTS--In the 45 trials in which salt reduction lasted four weeks or less the observed reductions in blood pressure were less than those predicted, with the difference between observed and predicted reductions being greatest in the trials of shortest duration. In the 33 trials lasting five weeks or longer the predicted reductions in individual trials closely matched a wide range of observed reductions. This applied for all age groups and for people with both high and normal levels of blood pressure. In people aged 50-59 years a reduction in daily sodium intake of 50 mmol (about 3 g of salt), attainable by moderate dietary salt reduction would, after a few weeks, lower systolic blood pressure by an average of 5 mm Hg, and by 7 mm Hg in those with high blood pressure (170 mm Hg); diastolic blood pressure would be lowered by about half as much. It is estimated that such a reduction in salt intake by a whole Western population would reduce the incidence of stroke by 22% and of ischaemic heart disease by 16% [corrected]. CONCLUSIONS--The results from the trials support the estimates from the observational data in the accompanying two papers. The effect of universal moderate dietary salt reduction on mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease would be substantial--larger, indeed, than could be achieved by fully implementing recommended policy for treating high blood pressure with drugs. However, reduction also in the amount of salt added to processed foods would lower blood pressure by at least twice as much and prevent some 75,000 [corrected] deaths a year in Britain as well as much disability. 
Hypertrophic repair of canine articular cartilage in osteoarthritis after anterior cruciate ligament transection. Transection of the anterior cruciate ligament in the dog is used frequently to produce a model of osteoarthritis (OA). Although it results in metabolic, biochemical, biomechanical and morphological changes in the articular cartilage of the unstable knee which resemble those in human OA, it rarely results in full thickness cartilage loss. The lack of progression of the cartilage lesions in this model has generally been attributed to stabilization of the joint by osteophytes and capsular fibrosis which develop following transection of the ligament. In our study transection of the anterior cruciate ligament of adult foxhounds and mongrels resulted in a progressive increase in the amount of articular cartilage in the unstable knee. In articular cartilage from the medial femoral condyle of the unstable knee the total amount of proteoglycan, as assessed by hexuronic acid analysis, and, often, the proteoglycan concentration were increased. Furthermore, the rate of proteoglycan synthesis was commonly elevated, in comparison with that from the contralateral knee. Thus, in these animals knee instability did not lead to loss of cartilage but to an active synthetic response by the chondrocytes resulting in hypertrophic cartilage repair which was sustained for up to 64 weeks of observation. 
Hydrogen peroxide as a mediator of dopac-induced effects on melanoma cells. Dopac increases tyrosinase activity and exerts cytotoxic effects in cultures of human melanoma cells. The possible role of hydrogen peroxide in these actions was examined. Catalase (100 micrograms/ml) completely reversed the cytotoxic action of 0.3 mM dopac and reduced its tyrosinase-stimulating effect by approximately one half. The results show that extracellular hydrogen peroxide is a mediator of both the tyrosinase-stimulating and cytotoxic actions of dopac. Analysis of the degradation products of melanin from dopac-treated melanoma cells after hydriodic acid (HI) hydrolysis revealed the presence of aminohydroxy-phenylacetic acid (AHPAc). This substance is obtained by HI hydrolysis of melanin formed by oxidation of cysteinyl-dopac. Thus, the presence of AHPAc indicates that dopac is transported into the melanocytes where it serves as a substrate for tyrosinase. 
Angiotensin II causes vascular hypertrophy in part by a non-pressor mechanism. Angiotensin II, when given in low doses, raises blood pressure slowly. When tested in vitro on vascular smooth muscle cells, it has mitogenic and trophic effects; it is not known if it has these effects in vivo. Our purpose was to determine whether vascular hypertrophy develops during slow pressor infusion of angiotensin II and, if so, whether it is pressure induced. Three experiments were done in rats infused subcutaneously with angiotensin II (200 ng/kg/min) by minipump for 10-12 days. Experiment 1: Angiotensin II gradually raised systolic blood pressure (measured in the tail) from 143 +/- 2 to 208 +/- 8 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM), significantly suppressing plasma renin and increasing threefold (NS) plasma angiotensin II. There was no loss of peptide in the pump infusate when tested at the end of the experiment. Experiment 2: In the perfused mesenteric circulation, vasoconstrictor responses to norepinephrine, vasopressin, and KCl were enhanced in rats given a slow pressor infusion of angiotensin II, but sensitivity of responses was not altered. This combination of changes suggests that vascular hypertrophy develops during slow pressor infusion of angiotensin II. Experiment 3: Vessel myography was done after angiotensin II infusion with and without a pressor response. Angiotensin II raised systolic blood pressure, increased heart weight, and produced myographic changes of vascular hypertrophy in the mesenteric circulation, increasing media width, media cross-sectional area, and media/lumen ratio. Hydralazine given with angiotensin II prevented the rise of pressure and the cardiac effect but not the vascular changes. Two-way analysis of variance showed that angiotensin II significantly increased media width, media cross-sectional area, and media/lumen ratio, all independent of hydralazine. Thus, although hydralazine inhibits the pressor and cardiac effects of angiotensin II, suggesting a pressor mechanism for the cardiac change, it does not inhibit structural vascular change, which suggests that at least part of the effect has a non-pressor mechanism. 
Incidence of aneurysms in Takayasu's arteritis. The angiographic findings of Takayasu's arteritis in a series of 113 patients were reviewed. Predominant findings were stenotic or occlusive changes, but fusiform or saccular aneurysms were also found in 36 patients (31.9%) in the various sites of aorta and its major branches. Multiple aneurysms were found in 15 patients. The most common site of aneurysms was the ascending aorta (16 patients); in 7 of the patients these were complicated by aortic regurgitation. Aneurysms developed in the aortic arch in 3 patients, in the descending aorta in 11, in the abdominal aorta in 7, and in the major branches of the aortic arch in 9 patients. In 2 patients, follow-up angiograms showed enlargement of the aneurysms, and rupture of the aneurysm occurred in 1 patient. Aneurysms were found even in young patients. A fifteen-year-old female showed a huge aneurysm in the ascending aorta as the initial manifestation of this disease. Thickening of the walls of aneurysms was common and characteristic. This study revealed the moderately high incidence of aneurysms of various sites of arteries in patients with Takayasu's arteritis. The authors conclude that aneurysm, as well as occlusive changes, can be a primary lesion. 
Clinical doxorubicin chemomyectomy. An experimental treatment for benign essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. Doxorubicin (DXR) was injected as a treatment for benign essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. The other eyelids were treated concurrently with botulinum toxin (BT). No DXR-treated eyelid has maintained 0 strength (commonly achieved with BT). Two patients with benign essential blepharospasm and four patients with hemifacial spasm have achieved major improvement, sustained for more than 6 months. Eyelids have been swollen and inflamed for up to 3 months. No spontaneously irreversible complication has occurred. A single injection at the maximum safe dose (1 mg in the upper lid and 1.5 mg in the lower lid) has not proven sufficient to produce cure. Treatment of each lower eyelid of a muscular male with severe blepharospasm may require cumulative doses of up to 4.0 mg, delivered in three injection events separated by at least 2 months, with each injection no greater than 1.5 mg DXR per site. At the present time, there is no assurance that a permanent cure will result. 
Assessment of proliferative potential in gliomatosis cerebri. The proliferative potential of neoplastic cells in two cases of gliomatosis cerebri was investigated by a combined staining technique, a one-step silver colloid method for nucleolar organizer region-associated protein (AgNOR) and immunohistochemistry for fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The neoplastic cells in the two cases had an abnormal shape and showed positive GFAP immunostaining in their cytoplasm. The numbers of AgNORs were counted in central and peripheral lesions of the neoplastic field in each case. The mean AgNOR scores in neoplastic cells were almost the same as those of nonneoplastic astrocytes in both the central and the peripheral lesions. These values were almost equal to the AgNOR score of low-grade gliomas. These findings indicate that gliomatosis cerebri has an invasive character in the central nervous system and often shows a malignant tendency, but its proliferative potential is significantly lower than that of high-grade gliomas. 
Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome of the lower limbs in renal transplant patients treated with cyclosporin A. In a 36-month period, 240 patients at our institution received kidney transplants from cadaver donors. Cyclosporin A (CsA) was used as the initial immunosuppressive therapy. Seven patients (5 men and 2 women) developed severe pain, periarticular soft tissue swelling with no effusion, and vasomotor changes in affected areas. Although articular mobility was conserved, most of the patients had great difficulty in walking. A patchy osteoporotic pattern was seen radiographically and increased uptake of 99mtechnetium with a periarticular distribution in the clinically affected areas were found. All of these symptoms and radiographic and scintigraphic signs are compatible with definite reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome (RSDS). Articular symptoms began within 3 months after kidney transplantation in all patients; all but 1 patient had plasma CsA levels greater than 200 ng/ml at that time. When the dosage of CsA was reduced, there was concomitant improvement in the RSDS, which appeared when the plasma CsA levels declined to less than 200 ng/ml. The mean duration of the clinical symptoms of RSDS was 8 months. We believe RSDS should be added to the list of complications that may appear in kidney transplant patients who receive CsA treatment. 
Human papillomavirus DNA sequences in cell lines derived from head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. There is increasing evidence that human papillomaviruses (HPV) have a casual role in some neoplasms in human beings. As examples, DNA of HPV types 16, 18, and 31 are frequently present in genital cancers in humans. Recently, oncogenic HPV types have also been identified in neoplasms of the head and neck, including verrucous carcinoma of the larynx, squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and larynx, and inverted papillomas of the nose. These findings and our resource of an extensive panel of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines led us to begin to investigate how frequently HPV DNA was present in these tumor cell lines. For initial analysis, twenty-two HNSCC cell lines derived from 20 patients' tumors were selected as representative of our tumor cell line panel with respect to diversity of primary site, tumor stage, patient age, sex, and clinical course. For Southern analysis, cell line DNA was tested for hybridization with DNA probes for HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 31. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was also performed on five tumor cell lines using types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 52 as probes. Southern blot analysis revealed HPV-specific signals in two of the 22 HNSCC cell lines tested. One of these, UM-SCC-23, was HPV 31 positive, which to our knowledge is the first identification of HPV 31 in HNSCC. UM-SCC-63, the other HPV-positive tumor identified by Southern analysis, hybridized with both type 18 and 31. Of the five tumor cell lines tested with PCR, two were HPV positive. 
Assessment of coronary artery patency after thrombolytic therapy: accurate prediction utilizing the combined analysis of three noninvasive markers. The predictability of patency of the infarct-related artery assessed by means of three noninvasive easily obtainable markers was prospectively examined in 82 patients undergoing thrombolysis for their first myocardial infarction. Positive noninvasive markers were defined as follows: 1) early peak creatine kinase (CK) activity less than or equal to 12 h after the start of thrombolysis; 2) greater than or equal to 50% reduction in ST segment elevation; and 3) occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias within the 1st 90 min of thrombolytic therapy. In 63 (77%) of the 82 patients, Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade II/III reperfusion was achieved within the 1st 90 min as assessed by coronary angiography. Separate analysis of each marker revealed the following respective values for sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive value regarding prediction of coronary artery patency: CK peak less than or equal to 12 h: 84%, 95%, 98% and 64%; reduction of the ST segment elevation greater than or equal to 50%: 60%, 95%, 97% and 42%; and reperfusion arrhythmias: 63%, 89%, 95% and 43%. The combined analysis of all three markers utilizing a logistic regression procedure showed that CK peak (p = 0.0001) and resolution of the ST segment elevation (p = 0.005), but not the occurrence of reperfusion arrhythmias (p = 0.26), were independent predictors of vessel patency. From this logistic regression procedure, a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 97% and a negative predictive value of 100% for prediction of coronary artery patency were obtained. 
Hypercholesterolemia in diabetes and glucose intolerance in the U.S. population. The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, according to the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program, has been determined in a national survey of diabetes and glucose intolerance. Rates of elevated total cholesterol in people with diabetes in the United States are only slightly greater than in those without diabetes after adjusting for age and sex. Nevertheless, high or borderline high total cholesterol is common in diabetes and is present in 70% of adults with diagnosed diabetes and 77% with undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S. population. Of these individuals, 95% have evidence of coronary heart disease or two or more risk factors for heart disease and should therefore have their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol measured. Based on our national data, LDL cholesterol levels warranting dietary treatment for hypercholesterolemia would be expected in 85% of these people. Although elevated LDL cholesterol is uncommon in people with diabetes who have total cholesterol of less than 200 mg/dl, other risk factors for coronary heart disease are very frequent (100% of men, 73% of women), and low total and LDL cholesterol may mask low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Therefore, investigation of blood lipid levels and coronary heart disease risk factors should be routine in all patients with diabetes, and treatment strategies should include management of lipid disorders and the multiple other risk factors for coronary heart disease that are highly prevalent in these patients. 
Breast sonography. Sonographic equipment for breast imaging has continued to improve, and the role of breast sonography has evolved to that of an indispensable adjunct to mammography. Breast sonography is not useful for screening for breast cancer in any age group. Its main use is for the differentiation of cystic vs solid palpable and mammographically visible masses. If strict sonographic criteria are used for a simple cyst, the diagnostic accuracy approaches 100%. Sonographic diagnosis of a simple cyst precludes the need for further workup, including aspiration, biopsy, or followup. This article emphasizes the technical aspects of breast sonography, especially those factors that alter the diagnostic information on the images. These factors can be especially problematic in differentiating cysts and solid masses, the most common diagnostic use of breast sonography. Selection of equipment depends largely on the requirements of a specific practice. Optimally, the sonographic equipment is located close to where mammography is performed, and the sonographic and mammographic findings are interpreted together. 
Electrocardiographic correlates with left ventricular morphology in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. The purpose of the present study was to verify whether the electrocardiographic pattern of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) might be useful in predicting measurements of left ventricular (LV) morphology. A total of 12 electrocardiographic criteria for LV enlargement were evaluated in 67 patients with IDC, aged 14 to 68 years (mean 48), and were correlated to LV wall thickness, volume and mass, as assessed at angiography (all patients) and echocardiography (50 patients). Linear regression analysis showed weak correlations between multiple electrocardiographic criteria and LV wall thickness, volume and mass. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that total 12-lead QRS amplitude, voltage criteria of Sokolow and Lyon, overshoot and U-wave inversion were the variables significantly related to LV wall thickness, as assessed by angiography (r = 0.55, p less than 0.005) and echocardiography (r = 0.43, p less than 0.025). The sum of T/R-wave ratios, the RV6/RV5 ratio and the Romhilt-Estes score were predictors of LV end-diastolic volume, as determined by angiography (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001) and echocardiography (r = 0.77, p less than 0.005). Total 12-lead QRS amplitude and the sum of T/R-wave ratios were the only independent predictors of LV mass, either angiographically (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) or echocardiographically measured (r = 0.71, p less than 0.025). It is concluded that a single electrocardiographic criterion for prediction of LV morphology in patients with IDC is barely effective. Multiple electrocardiographic criteria should be utilized to better predict LV mass and distinguish reliably between LV wall thickening and dilatation. 
Prevention of cold-induced increase in blood pressure of rats by captopril. To assess the possibility that the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the development of cold-induced hypertension, three groups of rats were used. Two groups were exposed to cold (5 +/- 2 degrees C) while the remaining group was kept at 26 +/- 2 degrees C. One group of cold-treated rats received food into which captopril (0.06% by weight) had been thoroughly mixed. The remaining two groups received the same food but without captopril. Systolic blood pressure of the untreated, cold-exposed group increased significantly above that of the warm-adapted, control group within 4 weeks of exposure to cold. In contrast, chronic treatment with captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure. Rats were killed after 4 months of exposure to cold. At death, the heart, kidneys, adrenal glands, and interscapular brown fat pad were removed and weighed. Although captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure in cold-treated rats, it did not prevent hypertrophy of the kidneys, heart, and interstitial brown adipose tissue that characteristically accompanies exposure to cold. Thus, chronic treatment with captopril prevented the elevation of blood pressure when administered at the time exposure to cold was initiated. It also reduced the elevated blood pressure of cold-treated rats when administered after blood pressure became elevated. This suggests that the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in the elevation of blood pressure during exposure to cold. 
Detection of T-cell receptor gamma chain V gene rearrangements using the polymerase chain reaction: application to the study of clonal disease cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This report describes the development and characterization of a method for the amplification of rearranged V-J segments of the human T-cell receptor gamma chain (TCRG) locus using an adaptation of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The technique uses a single pair of 'consensus' primers to amplify rearrangements involving the V gamma I subgroup genes, which are common in malignant cells from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. Using this method we were able to detect rearrangements in the TCRG locus in disease cells from patients with T-cell ALL (12 of 12), common ALL (10 of 14), and Null cell ALL (2 of 2) at presentation. Monoallelic and biallelic rearrangements involving V gamma I subgroup genes were identified by restriction analysis of PCR products from DNA samples from a T-cell leukemic cell line, T-cell clones, and disease cells from patients with ALL of T-and B-cell lineage at presentation. These results confirmed the presence of cell clones within the presentation samples and, in one case, confirmed the persistence of the original malignant cell clone at relapse. This is a rapid and specific method for the detection and characterization of rearrangements of the TCRG locus without recourse to Southern blotting. Therefore, the PCR technique described herein can provide the basis for the study of clonal evolution and minimal residual disease on a high proportion of patients with ALL. 
Histopathological changes in leiomyomata treated with leuprolide acetate. Several studies have shown a decrease in uterine and/or leiomyoma volume when treated with leuprolide acetate (LA), a widely used gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. The mechanism by which these changes occur is unknown. In this study, the histopathological slides of 31 women of reproductive age who underwent hysterectomy or myomectomy were blindly reviewed by a pathologist. Seventeen women underwent myomectomy. Among those, 10 were treated with LA. The tumors in all of these patients were reduced in size after therapy. Histopathologically, the LA treatment correlated with a significant reduction in cellularity. No significant change in fibrosis, edema, or mitotic activity was seen. 
A checklist for managing the dementia patient. Primary care physicians seeing a growing number of elderly demented patients must consider a number of problem areas when treating such patients. This article offers the mnemonic FICS'M (Family, Intellectual status, Continence, Sleep, and Mobility) to help physicians address treatable problems associated with dementing illnesses. Strategies are offered to minimize morbidity from the particular problem and from the treatment, such as trying "low toxicity" therapies and medications with few side effects. Other medical, ethical, and legal issues are discussed, including handling dangerous behaviors and abuse, nursing home placement and autopsy, and specific treatment of both the dementia itself and associated disorders--agitation, depression, and delirium. 
Wild-type and e antigen-minus hepatitis B viruses and course of chronic hepatitis. Using an oligonucleotide hybridization assay, we studied the clinical implication of wild-type hepatitis B virus (HBV) and a HBV mutant that is unable to secrete hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) because of a translational defect due to a stop codon in the pre-C region in 106 hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients with chronic hepatitis B. Wild-type HBV was detected in 31 of 42 (73.8%) HBeAg-positive patients, whereas a mixed viral population was present in 10 (23.8%). Significant differences in the severity and outcome of liver disease were not observed in the two groups of patients. However, the emergence of HBeAg-minus HBV in wild-type HBV carriers was associated with an exacerbation of liver disease and was followed by the presence of antibodies against HBeAg (anti-HBe) in serum in 50% of the cases. In 61 of 64 (95.3%) anti-HBe-positive patients, HBeAg-minus HBV was the predominant virus: HBeAg-minus HBV was detected in 42 patients (65.6%), whereas both wild-type and HBeAg-minus HBV were present in 19 (29.7%). HBeAg-minus HBV was associated with a course of hepatitis characterized by flare-ups of liver cell necrosis interspersed with periods of asymptomatic HBV carriage (P less than 0.01). These data support the hypothesis that genetic heterogeneity of HBV significantly influences the course and outcome of chronic hepatitis B. Wild-type HBV secreting HBeAg induces immunologic tolerance and causes chronic infection. HBeAg-minus HBV might be unable to induce chronic infection without the helper function of wild-type HBV, but it appears to be more pathogenic. Once chronic infection is established, HBeAg-minus HBV variants may prevail and displace wild-type virus. 
Aspirin in transient ischemic attacks and minor stroke: a meta-analysis. An overview analysis of seven randomized controlled trials testing the effectiveness of aspirin in the treatment of patients with transient ischemic attacks and minor strokes was performed. A total of 6409 patients from the seven trials was entered in the analysis; 2182 patients received only aspirin; 1598 patients received an aspirin-combination regimen with either sulfinpyrazone or dipyridamole; and 2629 subjects received a placebo. Aspirin alone produced an 18% decrease in all strokes and cardiovascular deaths. The pooling of studies examining aspirin-combination regimens and the larger grouping of studies of aspirin and aspirin-combination regimens led to more striking results. Indeed, significant risk reductions were observed for three of the four outcomes, namely, total deaths, total strokes, and total strokes and cardiovascular deaths, with odds ratios ranging from 0.59 to 0.78. Suggestive, albeit more modest, results were obtained when examining the impact of these regimens on total cardiovascular mortality. The same tendencies have also been observed in three previously published meta-analyses. 
Combined (team) approach to hemangioma management: arteriography with superselective embolization plus YAG laser/sapphire-tip resection. Thirteen patients have been treated over a 2-year period utilizing a team approach between the radiology and surgical services. Initial diagnostic evaluation is directed at determining the size and anatomic extent of the hemangioma; clinical assessment of coagulation and hemodynamic status is also performed. Arteriography with superselective embolization precedes the surgical procedure, usually by 24 hours. The YAG laser with contact sapphire-tip scalpels is then utilized for resection and reconstruction of the hemangioma. Total removal of hemangioma was achieved in 9 of 13 patients, and partial or subtotal removal was achieved in the remainder. Blood loss and complications were minimal. 
Induction of inflammatory arthropathy resembling rheumatoid arthritis in mice transgenic for HTLV-I. Human T cell leukemia virus type-I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia and has also been suggested to be involved in other diseases such as chronic arthritis or myelopathy. To elucidate pathological roles of the virus in disease, transgenic mice were produced that carry the HTLV-I genome. At 2 to 3 months of age, many of the mice developed chronic arthritis resembling rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial and periarticular inflammation with articular erosion caused by invasion of granulation tissues were marked. These observations suggest a possibility that HTLV-I is one of the etiologic agents of chronic arthritis in humans. 
MRI following severe perinatal asphyxia: preliminary experience. In 30 children suffering from severe perinatal asphyxia an attempt was made to determine the early prognostic signs of severe hypoxic-ischemic brain injury with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Ten early (1-4 days of age), 16 intermediate (2-4 weeks of age), and 38 late MRI (older than 1 month of age) procedures were performed on a 2.35 T MR-system. Severe cerebral necrosis was suspected by T2 hyperintensity of the white matter, with blurred limits to the cortex in early MRI, and was confirmed by T1 hyperintensity of the cortex in intermediate MRI. Severe cerebral necrosis was established at 3 months of age. Of the 11 children with this pattern (group A), 8 had severe and 3 had moderate cerebral palsy on subsequent examination. Thirteen children (group B) had normal late MRI scans; none developed severe cerebral palsy or marked mental retardation. Two children (group C) had focal ischemic lesions. Four children had intracranial hemorrhage (group D). Groups A and B did not differ in the severity of their perinatal histories and findings, suggesting that MRI during the first 3 months is of significant prognostic value. 
Papular dermatitis in adults: subacute prurigo, American style? Determining the best treatment for recurrent pruritic papular eruptions that do not fit well into a diagnosis (of either atopy or some other diagnosis) is sometimes frustrating. We have studied 12 patients with recurrent pruritic papular eruptions by obtaining extensive histories and by performing skin biopsies, immunofluorescence studies, and screening patch tests. The eruptions in this group are not atopic by strict criteria but have atopic features and are without a determinable exogenous cause. Histologic features resemble papular urticaria, but there is no history to suggest arthropod bites. Patients with this type of eruption have features similar to those with subacute prurigo, and they respond to variable combinations of topical or systemic corticosteroids, systemic antihistamines, and UVB or UVA. We suggest that the designation of subacute prurigo might be more appropriate for patients with these findings. 
Complications after intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin: rhabdomyolysis and metastatic infection. Two cases of adverse reaction to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) bladder instillations are reported. In both cases transient fevers and systemic symptoms developed following the instillations. After an additional instillation 1 patient had high fevers, severe myalgias and profound weakness followed by rhabdomyolysis and anuric renal failure, which required 3 weeks of hemodialysis before recovery. Extensive evaluation revealed no cause other than the BCG instillations. In the other patient a firm subcutaneous nodule gradually developed on the chest wall, which contained nonviable acid fast bacilli. 
Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following tumor resection: report of two cases. The authors report two cases of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following resection of an acoustic neuroma and a left sphenoid wing meningioma. Vascular spasm was documented by transcranial Doppler and angiography studies. Both patients responded to hypervolemic therapy. Possible mechanisms contributing to this rare complication are discussed. 
Metastatic melanoma to the heart presenting with ventricular tachycardia. Intraventricular tumors in adults are uncommon, and the association of these with ventricular tachycardia is even more rare. We report a case of an intracardiac metastatic melanoma in a woman who presented with syncope due to ventricular tachycardia. 
Prostate specific antigen: a critical assessment of the most useful tumor marker for adenocarcinoma of the prostate. PSA is a kallikrein-like, serine protease that is produced exclusively by the epithelial cells of all types of prostatic tissue, benign and malignant. Physiologically, it is present in the seminal fluid at high concentration and functions to cleave the high molecular weight protein responsible for the seminal coagulum into smaller polypeptides. This action results in liquefaction of the coagulum. PSA is also present in the serum and can be measured reliably by either a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay or a polyclonal radioimmunoassay. The calculated half-life of serum PSA ranges from 2.2 to 3.2 days and the metabolic clearance rate of this tumor marker follows first-order kinetics. Digital rectal examination, cystoscopic examination and prostate biopsy all can cause spurious elevations of the serum PSA concentration. Conditions such as bacterial prostatitis and acute urinary retention also can falsely elevate the serum PSA level. Because approximately 25% of the patients with BPH only will have an elevated serum PSA concentration and BPH tissue contributes to this PSA value in a variable manner from patient to patient, it is unlikely that PSA by itself will become an effective screening tool for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. However, if combined with digital rectal examination and/or transrectal ultrasound it may become a vital part of any early detection program. Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia also may be associated with moderately elevated serum PSA levels. Although there is a direct correlation between the serum PSA concentration and clinical stage, PSA is not sufficiently reliable to determine the clinical stage on an individual basis. This finding also applies to pathological stage. As a result, the preoperative serum PSA concentration cannot be used to decide whether to recommend radical prostatectomy for potential cure. Low preoperative serum PSA concentrations in patients with previously untreated prostate cancers are predictive of a negative bone scan. Thus, in these select patients a staging bone scintigram may not be necessary. With respect to monitoring patients after definitive therapy, PSA is an exquisitely sensitive tumor marker. Irrespective of the treatment modality (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy or antiandrogen treatment), PSA reflects accurately the tumor status of the patient and is prognostic of eventual outcome; this tumor marker is capable of predicting tumor recurrence months before its detection by any other method. PSA is also a most useful immunocytochemical marker. Its sensitivity and specificity to identify tissue of prostatic origin approach 100%. When compared to PAP, PSA is a more precise and meaningful marker in all clinical situations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The adrenocortical response to brain injury: correlation with the severity of neurologic dysfunction, effects of intoxication, and patient outcome. To test the hypothesis that cortisol levels reflect the extent of neurologic dysfunction and predict patient outcome, neurologic function and cortisol levels were determined in 120 traumatically brain injured patients who never received glucocorticoid treatment. Their mean age was 29 years and 78% were men. The impact of intoxication was examined in 59 patients who had ethanol levels measured. Ethanol was detectable in 40 patients and greater than or equal to 100 mg/dl in 31. There were significant correlations between the extent of neurologic dysfunction, determined by the Glasgow Coma Score and plasma cortisol concentrations 1 and 4 days postaccident. Cortisol levels were universally elevated on admission and approached normal 7 days later. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant effects of circulating ethanol levels on the association between cortisol concentrations and progressively worsening neurologic function, i.e., ethanol reduced the magnitude of the cortisol elevations in a dose dependent manner, abolishing this relationship at levels above 100 mg/dl. Analysis of the relationships between circulating cortisol levels and patient outcome provided a second method for ascertaining the association between injury severity and the magnitude of adrenocortical activation. Admission and day 1 cortisol concentrations were 25 to 40% lower in patients having good recoveries or moderate disabilities than those who remained severely disabled, persistently vegetative or died; serum cortisol values of less than 20 micrograms/dl one day after the accident were more likely to be associated with a good outcome than a poor one (55 vs. 25%, p less than 0.001). The worsening prognosis of patients having higher cortisol values is further reflected in the duration of acute hospitalization of these individuals. 
Syndrome X and hyperventilation. The cardiorespiratory responses to exercise and forced hyperventilation were measured in 17 unselected patients with syndrome X (angina, positive exercise test, normal coronary arteriogram, no other cardiovascular disease) and compared with those in 15 healthy subjects. Forced hyperventilation produced hypocapnia and metabolic alkalosis but no chest pain or electrocardiographic change. Patients with syndrome X showed reduced maximum oxygen consumption with an increased respiratory exchange ratio at peak exercise, confirming that exercise was limited by skeletal muscle perfusion--and thus that the increase in cardiac output with exercise is limited in syndrome X as in heart failure. Arterial carbon dioxide tension (PCO2) homoeostasis during exercise was normal but the ventilatory cost of carbon dioxide excretion was increased in syndrome X (as in heart failure). End tidal PCO2 measurements correlated only poorly with arterial PCO2 in individual patients with syndrome X, providing a possible explanation for previous reports, based on end tidal PCO2 of inappropriate hyperventilation. Patients with syndrome X did not show inappropriate hyperventilation but they did show hyperventilation that was appropriate to maintain normal arterial PCO2 in the face of reduced cardiac reserve. 
Fulminant pulmonary aspergillus infection occluding the aortic arch after high-dose antileukemic chemotherapy. After antileukemic chemotherapy a granulocytopenic patient experienced a rapidly progressive left-sided pneumonia with pleuritic pain. After 1 week, a sudden occlusion of all aortic branches was followed by death. At postmortem, a huge thrombus in the aortic arch caused by Aspergillus invasion from the left lung was found. 
Mid-brain pathology of Wilson's disease: MRI analysis of three cases. MRI scans were obtained from three patients with Wilson's disease, all of whom showed rigidity and dysarthria; two also showed tremor and dystonia. Two had been treated with D-penicillamine for seven and 14 years, respectively and their neurological abnormalities had improved, but the third patient had not been treated. T2-weighted MRI of the mid-brain in all three revealed the characteristic "face of the giant panda" sign, consisting of high signal intensity in the tegmentum except for red nucleus, preservation of signal intensity of the lateral portion of the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and hypo-intensity of the superior colliculus. The clinical significance of these MRI abnormalities is discussed. 
Sickle cell disease and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. While neurological complications are common in sickle cell disease, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage has been rarely reported. A case is presented of a young man with sickle cell disease and subarachnoid hemorrhage found to have two mid-basilar aneurysms, the largest of which had bled. Available literature suggests that this patient may be quite representative as nearly one half of documented cases have been noted to harbor multiple aneurysms, and posterior circulation involvement appears to be common. These anatomic features may relate to the pathophysiology of arterial destruction common in sickle cell disease. 
Severe congestive heart failure. How successful are drug and transplant therapies? Severe congestive heart failure is a fatal illness. Aggressive use of proven medical regimens, including vasodilators and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, may prolong survival time for some patients. Those with refractory symptoms and seriously reduced left ventricular function, impaired exercise capacity, and complex or frequent ventricular arrhythmias should be considered for cardiac transplantation. Candidacy for transplantation is based on the absence of other illnesses that would limit survival or diminish the likelihood of success of the transplant. With the introduction of potent immunosuppressive agents, particularly cyclosporine (Sandimmune), survival rates after transplantation have improved to 90% at 1 year. Major problems include organ rejection, serious infection, development of coronary artery disease in the transplanted heart, and the limited donor organ supply. 
Air in the temporomandibular joint fossa: CT sign of temporal bone fracture. Temporal bone fractures can be difficult to detect clinically and radiographically. Air is sometimes present in the glenoid fossa of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) at computed tomography (CT) of acute basilar skull fractures. This study evaluated TMJ fossa air as a sign of temporal bone fracture. Initial CT scans of the head in 114 patients with a diagnosis of basilar skull fracture at discharge were retrospectively reviewed. TMJ fossa air was present in 23 of 114 patients (20.2%) and was bilateral in three patients. Only temporal bone fractures were significantly (P less than .001) associated with TMJ fossa air. Temporal bone fractures were observed at CT in 23 of 26 cases of TMJ fossa air, but in three of 26 cases, TMJ fossa air was the only CT sign of clinically apparent temporal bone fractures. TMJ fossa air is associated with acute temporal bone fracture and may be the only CT sign of an otherwise inconspicuous temporal bone fracture. 
Regulation of c-myc expression by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in human leukemia cells. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates both the proliferation and functional properties of normal and leukemic myeloid cells via cell surface receptors. The postreceptor mechanisms for these two actions, and the extent to which they represent overlapping biochemical pathways, have not been fully clarified. We have examined the actions of GM-CSF on the expression of c-myc, an early response oncogene associated with the proliferative stimulus of growth factors. GM-CSF reduced the population doubling time of HL-60 leukemia cells from 32 hours to 25 hours, and, at concentrations that were correlated with mitogenicity, induced a rapid twofold increase in the level of c-myc mRNA. Nuclear runoff studies indicated that GM-CSF approximately doubled the transcription rate of c-myc by reversing the transcription attenuation that occurs at the exon 1-intron 1 junction. GM-CSF had no effect on the half-life of c-myc messenger RNA. The biochemical basis for the modulation of c-myc expression by GM-CSF was explored. GM-CSF treatment caused intracellular alkalinization of the cells as measured using the fluorescent probe 2', 7-bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5(and-6) carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). The sodium channel blocker amiloride prevented the GM-CSF-induced change in pH, but did not affect the stimulation of c-myc transcription by GM-CSF. Agents that increase cellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (prostaglandin E2 and cholera toxin) blocked the actions of GM-CSF on c-myc; however, these agents also reduced the basal level of c-myc expression. GM-CSF caused a rapid (5 minutes) and transient decline in cellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) levels, and a slower (30 minutes) and transient decrease in cellular cAMP levels. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the declines in cAMP and cGMP are associated with a stimulation of HL-60 proliferation, while previously reported manipulations that elevate cyclic nucleotides are related to an inhibition of HL-60 proliferation and the potentiation of differentiation. 
Normalization of left ventricular mass and associated changes in neurohormones and atrial natriuretic peptide after 1 year of sustained nifedipine therapy for severe hypertension. Sixteen patients with severe hypertension were treated for 1 year with extended release nifedipine, during which time serial changes in left ventricular mass index and associated alterations in left ventricular systolic function, left ventricular filling, plasma renin activity, atrial natriuretic peptide and catecholamines were evaluated. Mean seated blood pressure (+/- SE) was significantly reduced from 200 +/- 8/122 +/- 3 to 144 +/- 5/89 +/- 2 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001) at 1 year. After 6 months, left ventricular mass index was significantly reduced by 19% from 121 +/- 8 to 96 +/- 7 g/m2 and this reduction was sustained at 1 year. Septal and posterior wall thickness were reduced from 13.4 +/- 0.1 to 11.2 +/- 0.04 mm and from 12.8 +/- 0.1 to 10.0 +/- 0.03 mm (p less than 0.001), respectively. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy decreased from 63% to 25%. Left ventricular fractional shortening increased from 34 +/- 2% to 41 +/- 3% (p less than 0.05) and the relation between fractional shortening and end-systolic stress did not change. Over the year of sustained blood pressure reduction, the peak velocity of early filling increased from 57 +/- 3 to 63 +/- 4 cm/s (p = 0.07), peak velocity of late filling did not change and the ratio of late to early peak left ventricular filling velocity significantly decreased (p less than 0.05). Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels, markedly elevated at entry, decreased from 70 +/- 15 to 41 +/- 8 pg/ml at 1 year (p less than 0.05). Plasma renin activity and catecholamine levels were not altered. 
Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency and cutaneous vasculitis. Report of a case with exacerbation of a cutaneous neoplasm during immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a patient with both Muir-Torre syndrome and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. A keratoacanthoma developed after immunosuppressive therapy for necrotizing vasculitis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of Muir-Torre syndrome associated with alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. 
Cardiac function after hepatic ischemia-anoxia and reperfusion injury: a new experimental model. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: During liver transplantation, reperfusion of the donor liver and in the clinical setting, end-stage liver disease, have occasionally resulted in profound cardiovascular disturbances. The etiology of hepatic injury-induced myocardial dysfunction is still unclear. In this study, the aims were to develop an experimental model that would facilitate the study of the effects of hepatic failure on myocardial function and to determine whether hepatic ischemia or anoxia and reperfusion injury of similar duration would result in the same degree of hepatic failure. Seventy male Sprague-Dawley rats were used as organ donors. Three simultaneous liver-heart perfusions (corresponding to three groups) were established using a modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer with 2% bovine albumin, membrane oxygenation, and a peristaltic pump. Group 1 (n = 10) and group 2 (n = 15) experiments consisted of liver-heart perfusions after 90 mins of normothermic hepatic ischemia or 90 mins of hepatic anoxia, respectively, followed by reoxygenation and 60 mins of reperfusion. Group 3 (n = 8) experiments consisted of sham liver-heart perfusions studied over the same experimental time period (60 mins). Myocardial function variables, liver function tests, arterial blood gases, and electrolytes were measured at baseline and at 3-, 10-, 30-, and 60-min intervals during reperfusion in all experiments. RESULTS: Ischemia or anoxia-induced hepatic failure resulted in a similar degree of hepatic dysfunction. Both forms of acute hepatic failure caused significant increases in liver function tests, a reduction in heart rate (p less than .05), coronary flow (p less than .05), and an increase in calculated coronary vascular resistance (p less than .05). There were no changes in buffer pH, CO2, or ionized calcium that could explain the coronary vasoconstriction. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatic dysfunction induced by ischemia or anoxia of similar duration results in a similar hepatic metabolic profile during reperfusion and can cause direct myocardial dysfunction of the isolated perfused rat heart. 
Surgically treated cavernous angiomas of the brain stem: report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of surgically treated brain stem cavernous angiomas are presented. The previously reported cases are reviewed and the clinical features, radiographic appearance, and treatment of this condition are discussed. Symptomatic brain stem cavernous angiomas should be treated surgically and can be removed with good outcomes. 
Colchicine and antineoplastic therapy for the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions. The complexity of the events that culminate in intimal proliferation after arterial injury and similarities between this response and benign neoplasia suggest that conventional medical therapies will continue to be unsuccessful in preventing recurrent stenosis after percutaneous coronary revascularization. By preventing cell division after smooth muscle cell activation, antimitogenic therapy may inhibit the final common pathway in this complex chain of events and offset the apparent loss of local growth control. Colchicine, which causes metaphase arrest of cell division, has been shown in experimental studies to decrease the extent of atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the severity of arterial restenosis after balloon angioplasty. However, preliminary results from a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial suggest that low dose colchicine (0.6 mg twice a day orally) does not prevent restenosis. The use of more potent antineoplastic agents is limited by the potential for life-threatening side effects. It is possible that these adverse effects can be averted by using novel drug delivery systems to administer antimitogenic therapy locally at the site of arterial injury or by using low dose synergistic combinations of antiproliferative agents. This review examines the potential role of antimitogenic therapy in the prevention of restenosis after coronary interventions and considers the possibility of an overlap of the therapeutic realms of interventional cardiology and medical oncology. 
Symptomatic retinoschisis-detachment involving the macula. We treated three patients (four eyes) in whom posteriorly situated retinoschisis-detachments became symptomatic because of elevation of a limited area of full-thickness retina at the macula adjacent to these lesions. Laser photocoagulation alone was successful in achieving long-term macular reattachment in one eye but failed in both eyes of a bilaterally affected patient. In this patient, retinal cryopexy, external drainage of subretinal and retinoschisis cavity fluid, and intravitreal air injection attained long-term macular reattachment and retinoschisis cavity collapse in both eyes. In the third patient, cryopexy, drainage of subretinal and retinoschisis cavity fluid, and scleral buckling failed to reattach the retina. Subsequent laser photocoagulation induced reabsorption of subretinal fluid but without retinoschisis cavity collapse. Alternative management strategies for these unusual cases include retinal cryopexy alone and vitrectomy techniques. 
Self-inflicted eye injuries. Five cases of self-inflicted eye injury are described and discussed. A review of the literature shows that several psychiatric diagnoses have been assigned to people who damage their eyes. A variety of mechanisms to explain this phenomenon are described. 
Skin pretreatment and the use of transdermal clonidine. Although therapy with transdermal clonidine is effective in bringing elevated blood pressure under control, this mode of delivery has been associated with localized dermal reactions in a small percentage of patients. Because anecdotal information suggests that a number of physicians have resorted to various dermal pretreatment strategies in an effort to alleviate or eliminate these dermal reactions, we decided to investigate the two most commonly used pretreatment strategies, to determine if they affected the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of transdermally administered clonidine. Specifically, we examined the effect of dermal pretreatment with 0.5% hydrocortisone cream and with an over-the-counter antacid, magnesium-aluminum hydroxide suspension, on the pharmacokinetics of transdermal clonidine in 10 adult hypertensive males. Patients were randomized to receive one of the two pretreatment regimens or therapy with the patch alone, and after 7 days of treatment and a 14-day washout period, patients were crossed over to receive one of the other therapies. All patients ultimately received all three therapies. We present here the results from the 10 patients enrolled in our study. Our study found a statistical difference detected in maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), steady-state plasma concentration (Css), and apparent clonidine dose delivered (Doseapp) following dermal pretreatment with hydrocortisone compared with the transdermal patch alone. The mean +/- SD relative extents of absorption (Frel) of clonidine following dermal pretreatment with hydrocortisone and magnesium-aluminum hydroxide in respect to the transdermal patch alone were 94.84 +/- 45.69% and 97.65 +/- 59.65%, respectively. No significant difference was detected in this parameter. Supine and sitting blood pressures and pulse rates were similar during treatment with clonidine alone, following dermal pretreatment with hydrocortisone cream, and following pretreatment with magnesium-aluminum hydroxide suspension. In addition, systemic side effects were evenly distributed among treatments. However, dermal side effects were less frequent following pretreatment with hydrocortisone compared with magnesium-aluminum hydroxide and the patch alone. The results of this study suggest that dermal pretreatment with 0.5 percent hydrocortisone cream may significantly alter the plasma concentrations of transdermally administered clonidine without adversely altering the pharmacodynamics. 
Use of the optical urethrotome knife in the treatment of a benign low rectal anastomotic stricture. Several methods of treatment for benign anastomotic strictures following anterior resection have been described. Surgical intervention in terms of re-exploration and excision of the stricture or the formation of a permanent colostomy will be accompanied by substantial morbidity. The dilatation of these strictures without direct vision may not be safe. We describe a simple method of treating benign rectal anastomotic stricture using an optical urethrotome knife under direct vision. This technique affords an accurate incision of the stricture to increase the size of the lumen, thereby relieving obstruction. 
A balanced carbohydrate: protein diet in the management of Parkinson's disease. Although restricting dietary protein is a proposed adjunct to treating Parkinson's disease (PD), the effect of carbohydrate consumption is unknown. We measured plasma levodopa and large neutral amino acid (LNAA) levels in nine PD patients treated with carbidopa/levodopa and different isocaloric meals containing high protein-low carbohydrate, low protein-high carbohydrate, and balanced 5:1 carbohydrate:protein mixtures. We found that levodopa levels increased significantly regardless of the type of diet, but that plasma LNAA levels varied less and motor performance was superior after the balanced diet than after the other two meals. We conclude that PD patients can consume nutritionally adequate meals and still maintain a stable plasma levodopa:LNAA ratio. 
Prevention of an air embolism by moderate hypoventilation during surgery in the sitting position. The effect of ventilation (normo-, hypo-, and hyperventilation) on transverse sinus pressure (TSP), central venous pressure (CVP), mean arterial blood pressure (mABP), and heart rate was studied in 15 patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment in the sitting position for tumors of the posterior fossa, and the findings were compared with the influence of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) on these parameters. TSP was not influenced significantly by PEEP ranging from 0 to 15 mbar, whereas CVP increased. At the same time, mABP decreased slightly. In contrast, TSP showed characteristic changes with varying ventilation: during normoventilation [end expiratory CO2 pressure (PECO2), 38 mm Hg], TSP was 3 mm Hg and increased to 7 mm Hg on average with hypoventilation (PECO2, 44 mm Hg), whereas hyperventilation (PECO2, 32 mm Hg) caused a reduction in TSP to the atmospheric range. At the same time, CVP remained unchanged, whereas mABP increased with hypoventilation. Presuming that the risk of venous air embolism is closely related to the level of TSP, our results allow the following conclusions. 1) PEEP does not seem to be effective in preventing venous air embolism. 2) Hyperventilation is dangerous in the sitting position, as TSP is reduced to the atmospheric and even subatmospheric range. 3) To prevent air embolism, moderate hypoventilation is recommended during the most critical period of exposing the posterior fossa followed by normoventilation when surgery of the actual lesion has begun. 
Antiphospholipid antibodies in cerebral ischemia. In a 2-year prospective study of 146 patients with cerebral ischemia, we compared vascular risk factors for stroke with clinical and laboratory findings, particularly antiphospholipid antibodies. Ten patients (6.8%) were positive for at least one antiphospholipid antibody; one patient had systemic lupus erythematosus, one had rheumatoid arthritis, and the remaining eight fulfilled criteria for the diagnosis of primary antiphospholipid syndrome. These patients were predominantly male, not necessarily young, and 50% of them did not have any other vascular risk factors; there were no significant clinical or paraclinical differences between these patients and those without antiphospholipid antibodies. Outcome in the 10 patients was good, and platelet antiaggregating drugs proved to be useful in preventing further cerebrovascular ischemic events in our patients. 
Clinical significance of pericardial rub with regional ventricular dilatation. To elucidate the clinical characteristics associated with regional ventricular dilatation in the early phase of myocardial infarction (MI), 228 patients with acute Q-wave anterior MI were studied. Forty-nine patients (21 percent) had echocardiographically demonstrated regional ventricular dilatation (an abnormal bulge in the left ventricular contour during both systole and diastole) on the third hospital day. Careful auscultation revealed that a pericardial rub was present in 49 patients (21 patients with and 28 patients without regional ventricular dilatation) during the first three days after hospital admission. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of pericardial rub with six other clinical variables related to regional ventricular dilatation. Pericardial rub and cardiac output were the significant factors related to the presence of regional ventricular dilatation. Thus, a pericardial rub, in concert with impaired left ventricular function, is a physical sign associated with regional ventricular dilatation, and anatomically transmural infarction is the possible factor explaining their association. 
Long-time survival of a patient with glioblastoma and Turcot's syndrome. Case report. A rare case of Turcot's syndrome is reported in a long-time survivor of glioblastoma multiforme. The patient was treated for his tumor in 1976 with macroscopically complete surgical resection and radiotherapy consisting of 60 Gy to the tumor bed and 40 Gy to the whole brain. Five years later, in 1981, he developed adenocarcinoma of the colon Dukes Stage B which was successfully treated at another hospital by surgery alone. In 1990, he presented with multiple colon polyps and adenocarcinoma Dukes Stage A. For more than 15 years, the patient has been afflicted with cystic and conglobate acne. Possible mechanisms and treatment with 13-cis retinoic acid are discussed. 
Effects of isradipine on platelet function in hypertension at rest and during exercise. The effects of eight weeks of treatment with isradipine (1.25 mg twice daily for four weeks, followed by 2.5 mg twice daily for four weeks) on ex vivo platelet function were investigated in ten male patients with hypertension. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serum thromboxane B2, and beta-thromboglobulin levels were significantly decreased (P less than .05) at rest before exercise ergometry, during exercise, and at rest after exercise. The platelet count and plasma levels of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) were not affected by isradipine. It is concluded that treatment of hypertension with a compound that lowers blood pressure and inhibits platelet activation may be of clinical benefit when routinely applied in hypertensive patients. 
Atrial natriuretic peptide response to cardioversion of atrial flutter and fibrillation and role of associated heart failure. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentrations were measured before and 1 hour after cardioversion in 40 patients (27 with atrial flutter and 13 with atrial fibrillation) admitted for elective cardioversion. Fourteen (11 with atrial flutter and 3 with atrial fibrillation) had clinical evidence of congestive heart failure (CHF). Conversion to sinus rhythm was successful in 39 patients. The mean ANP concentration in the entire group decreased after cardioversion from 38 +/- 4 to 17 +/- 2 pmol/liter (p less than 0.001). In the subgroup with CHF, the ANP level, which was not significantly higher than that in the group without CHF, decreased from 47 +/- 8 to 19 +/- 3 pmol/liter (p less than 0.01). Neither mode of cardioversion (spontaneous 1, pharmacologic 2 and direct-current countershock 36) nor associated CHF influenced ANP response to cardioversion. One patient with atrial flutter and "failed cardioversion" had unchanged ANP level. The decrease after cardioversion in ANP concentration correlated with its control level (r = 0.88, p less than 0.001) but not with the decrease in heart rate. The ANP level in patients with atrial fibrillation was 45 +/- 9 vs 38 +/- 5 pmol/liter in those with atrial flutter (difference not significant). Arrhythmia duration, left atrial size, and ventricular rate or arterial blood pressure did not correlate with ANP concentration in any subgroup. It is concluded that (1) the ANP level is elevated comparably in patients with both atrial flutter and fibrillation regardless of the presence or absence of CHF; and (2) the level decreases, independent of the mode of cardioversion or presence of CHF, promptly after successful cardioversion. 
Urinary retention--an unusual dystonic reaction to continuous metoclopramide infusion. Vomiting is one of the most distressing adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy. Metoclopramide by continuous infusion (400 micrograms/kg/h after a loading dose of 2.5 mg/kg) is a novel administration method for optimizing efficacy. A two-year-old boy developed urinary retention on three occasions, once accompanied by priapism and slurred speech, while receiving a continuous infusion. This was reversed by procyclidine, suggesting that it may have been a dystonic reaction. 
Transforming growth factors beta 1 and alpha in chronic liver disease. Effects of interferon alfa therapy BACKGROUND. Cirrhosis is a diffuse process of hepatic fibrosis and regenerative nodule formation of unknown pathogenesis. Transforming growth factor (TGF) beta 1 induces the production of extracellular matrix proteins by liver cells and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis in laboratory animals. TGF alpha is a hepatocyte mitogen that participates in liver regeneration. METHODS. Using Northern blot analysis, we studied the expression of TGF beta 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in liver specimens from 42 patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis and 12 subjects with either normal or fatty livers. The results were correlated with measurements of procollagen Type I mRNA in liver tissue, procollagen Type III peptide in serum, and the degree of histologic injury. We also investigated whether TGF alpha mRNA would be detectable in biopsy specimens of livers with proliferative activity. RESULTS. TGF beta 1 mRNA expression correlated closely with the expression of procollagen Type I mRNA (r = 0.94) and serum procollagen Type III peptide (r = 0.89) and with the histologic activity index (r = 0.73). All patients with increased fibrogenic activity (serum procollagen Type III peptide level, greater than 11.9 micrograms per liter) had increased levels of TGF beta 1 mRNA (2 to 14 times the levels in the control group or in patients with normal fibrogenic activity), and both TGF alpha and H3 histone (a marker of DNA synthesis) mRNAs were detectable in patients with regenerative nodules. Six of eight patients with hepatitis C treated with interferon alfa for one year had sustained clinical responses with normalization of serum procollagen Type III peptide and aminotransferase activity. All these patients had normal levels of TGF beta 1 mRNA in liver specimens obtained at the end of the year. CONCLUSIONS. TGF beta 1 may have an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease, and TGF alpha expression may be associated with liver regeneration in these patients. 
Immunohistochemical characterization, distribution, and ultrastructure of lymphocytes bearing T-cell receptor gamma/delta in inflammatory bowel disease. Phenotypic characterization and distribution of gamma/delta T lymphocytes in the intestinal mucosa were investigated in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease by immunohistochemistry. The ratio of delta(+) cells to CD3(+) cells in the intraepithelial space of colon was decreased in Crohn's disease (13%) and strikingly decreased in ulcerative colitis (8%) compared with the control (36%). Delta(+) cells in the lamina propria were also decreased, particularly in the distal ileum of Crohn's disease (4%), compared with the control (15%). On the contrary, the cells gathered at the severe inflammatory sites with other inflammatory cells, including beta(+) cells, and were densely distributed in the T-cell zone around lymphoid follicles. Phenotypic characterization showed that delta(+) lamina proprial lymphocytes of colon were mainly CD4(-)CD8(-) in the control (80%) and Crohn's disease (59%). However, in ulcerative colitis, CD4(-)CD8(-) delta(+) lymphocytes were rarely found (3%). This reflects the difference of immunologic background between the two diseases. Immunoelectron microscopically, these cells in inflammatory bowel disease were rich with vesicular structures in cytoplasms, whereas those in the control group contained electron-opaque granules. The decrease and the morphological change may be closely related to the weakness of mucosal defense. 
Haemodynamic considerations in the management of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Cerebral vasospasm occurs, following subarachnoid haemorrhage, in the majority of patients and is accompanied by cerebral ischaemia in 30%. The objectives of this article are to review (1) the effects of subarachnoid haemorrhage and vasospasm on cerebral blood flow (CBF); (2) the effects of induced hypotension and hypocapnia on CBF in these patients; (3) current therapy for cerebral ischaemia from vasospasm. The medical literature was searched using Index Medicus; for the period 1983-90 this search was done on a computer with the CD-ROM version of Index Medicus, Silver Platter. Papers were selected on the basis of validity and applicability to clinical practice; animal studies are included when human data is lacking. Cerebral vasospasm may decrease cerebral blood flow, disturb autoregulation and place the patient at risk for delayed cerebral ischaemia. Intraoperative induced hypotension and hypocapnia can decrease CBF further, although effects of either on outcome have not been evaluated. Calcium antagonists are effective for both the prevention and the treatment of delayed cerebral ischaemia. Of the mechanical treatments, systemic-arterial hypertension has the firmest scientific foundation, although this is frequently combined with haemodilution and blood volume expansion. There is a need for randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy of these latter treatments. 
Caffeine clearance by enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique: a simple, inexpensive, and useful indicator of liver function. The clinical value and sensitivity of serum caffeine clearance measurement has been evaluated as an indicator of hepatic disease. After a 17 hour caffeine exclusion period, 300 mg of caffeine citrate was administered orally to the study subjects. Serum samples were taken four and 16 hours later. Serum caffeine concentrations were measured using an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) and a clearance value derived. Conventional liver function tests were measured at the same time. A total of 103 subjects attending the medical unit in a district general hospital were studied. Twenty one had alcoholic liver disease, 11 non-alcoholic cirrhosis, nine non-cirrhotic liver disease, 21 suspected liver disease, six hepatic tumours, and 35 were hospital and normal control subjects. Caffeine clearance values were lowest in subjects with alcoholic liver disease (median 0.19 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-0.61 ml/min/kg) and significantly reduced in all subjects with liver disease (median 0.32 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-2.68 ml/min/kg) compared with control subjects (median 1.27 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001). In subjects with suspected liver disease subsequently shown to have another explanation for abnormal liver function test results, caffeine clearance values were normal (median 1.31 ml/min/kg, range 0.23-2.64 ml/min/kg) and significantly different, p less than 0.001, from those of subjects with liver disease. Serum albumen values were not different for these latter two groups. Using a cut off value of 0.86 ml/min/kg, caffeine clearance measurement was 100% sensitive for alcoholic liver disease and 89% sensitive for all liver disease. The respective sensitivities for conventional liver function test measurement were 76% and 83%. In the suspected liver disease group, caffeine clearance was abnormal in only 24%, conventional liver function tests were abnormal in 95%. 
Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. A case of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung is described in a 19-year-old man who had had a lobectomy in infancy, for removal of a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation. It is suggested that congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation may predispose a patient to development of epithelial malignancies of the lung, whereas mesenchymal hamartomas usually are associated with nonepithelial neoplasms. 
Expression of perforin in infiltrating cells in murine hearts with acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3. BACKGROUND. Cell-mediated autoimmunity has been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using a murine model of acute myocarditis caused by coxsackievirus B3, we analyzed the phenotypes and morphology of the infiltrating cells in the hearts by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. We also examined the expression of a cytolytic factor, perforin, in the infiltrating cells by immunoperoxidase and in situ hybridization. We found that the dominant population of the infiltrating cells were asialo GM1 positive, were negative for T-cell markers, and had electron-dense cytoplasmic granules, which is consistent with a morphology of large granular lymphocytes. Perforin was found in the cytoplasmic granules of the infiltrating cells expressing perforin messenger RNA. These findings provide for the first time the direct evidence that the first wave of cell infiltration in hearts mainly consists of killer cells and strongly suggests that perforin plays, in part, an important role in myocardial cell damage involved in acute viral myocarditis. T-helper cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes made up the second wave of cell infiltration. CONCLUSIONS. As we previously reported, the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I antigen on cardiac myocytes induced by the infiltrating cells, such as killer cells, may facilitate the interaction between cardiac myocytes and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and may lead to further myocardial cell damage in a later phase. 
Macroscopic vasovasostomy re-examined. Results of 273 consecutive macroscopic vasovasostomy procedures performed at a single institution over a nine-year period between 1978 and 1987 were reviewed. When patients operated on less than five years after vasectomy were compared with those in whom more than five years had elapsed since vasectomy, significant declines in technical success rates as measured by return of sperm to the ejaculate (93% vs. 74%, p less than 0.004), biologic recovery as measured by mean sperm counts (55 million vs. 35 million) and mean progressive sperm motility (30% vs. 13%), and clinical success as measured by pregnancy rates (52% vs. 30%, p less than 0.02), were observed. Examination of complications of vasovasostomy showed a 7.7 percent overall complication rate and a 1.5 percent incidence of major complications. 
Radiologic evaluation of the normal and diseased posterior cervical space. The posterior cervical space seen on cross-sectional imaging of the neck constitutes most of the posterior triangle seen on clinical examination. Although triangular anatomy relates best to the surface perspective of the clinician, a spatial approach to anatomy works better for the radiologist viewing axial images. The posterior cervical space is defined as the area in the posterolateral portion of the neck from the skull base to the clavicles deep to the sternomastoid and trapezius muscles but superficial to the prevertebral space. Its principal contents are fat, the spinal accessory nerve, and lymph nodes. We analyzed CT and MR images and clinical records of 63 patients known or suspected to have disease of the posterior cervical space to determine the imaging features that mark a lesion as originating in the posterior cervical space and the spectrum of diseases that arise there. Of the 63 patients in the study, four had clinical pseudomasses, nine had congenital lesions, 10 had inflammatory disease, six had benign tumors, and 34 had malignant tumors. A typical mass lesion of the posterior cervical space was centered within the fat of the space, between the deep and superficial layers of the deep cervical fascia. Characteristic displacements caused by a mass in the posterior cervical space included anteromedial displacement of the carotid space and posteromedial displacement of the prevertebral space. Our study shows that the differential diagnosis of lesions of the posterior cervical space reflects the normal contents of the space, and that diagnosis can thereby be predicted from knowledge of the normal anatomy and contents of the space. 
Adenosine triphosphate-sensitive potassium channels in anoxia. Potassium channels that are activated by decreasing adenosine trisphosphate levels are blocked by sulfonylurea drugs such as glibenclamide but are opened by diazoxide and some endogenous peptides. Judging from the effects of such drugs, it seems that in the hippocampus, these channels are present not on cell bodies but rather on glutamate-releasing nerve terminals (especially those of mossy fibers in the CA3 region). Because activation of these presynaptic potassium channels reduces anoxic glutamate release, they may be a useful target for specific drug therapy that might prevent the excitoxic effects of excessive glutamate release during anoxia/ischemia. 
Sexual function of women taking antihypertensive agents: a comparative study. OBJECTIVE: To develop a method to evaluate the effects of clonidine and prazosin on sexual function in hypertensive women. DESIGN: Crossover, active-drug controlled pilot study. SETTING: Community recruitment to a university-based teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Ten premenopausal and eight postmenopausal women with mild hypertension and unimpaired sexual function. INTERVENTION: Periodic, self-administered daily diaries assessed the sexual arousal and desire and orgasmic function of women receiving placebo, clonidine, and prazosin. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using analysis of variance for orgasmic characteristics and comparison of the percentages of yes responses to the sexual function questions, no significant difference in the levels of sexual function of women receiving placebo, clonidine, and prazosin was found. However, there was a suggestion that clonidine and prazosin affected some aspects of sexual function. Of the women who received clonidine first, fewer were receptive to partner approach during medication therapy (49%) than during placebo (61%). Fewer women wished for their partners to approach them (WISH) during therapy (41% and 53% for clonidine and prazosin, respectively) than during placebo (60%). In the group that received prazosin first, WISH was affected (32% for prazosin, 31% for clonidine, 45% for placebo). Orgasmic strength increased from 2.1 on placebo to 2.7 on clonidine (second medication), measured on a four-point Likert scale. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study developed a method using self-administered daily diaries for evaluating the effects of antihypertensive agents on sexual function in hypertensive women. These potential effects need to be evaluated in larger studies. 
A review of 13-years experience of osteosarcoma. Since the inception of the authors' facility, 365 patients with osteogenic sarcoma have been treated. While other facilities were surgically treating patients with primary amputation, this facility attempted limb-salvage surgery. The majority of patients being treated with limb-salvage surgery had the resected bone replaced by a metallic endoprosthetic replacement. The emphasis on conservative surgery led to the development of growing endoprosthetic replacements with the first being used in 1975. The cumulative survival of those patients with Stage 2 osteosarcoma treated at this facility between 1977 and 1984 is 48% at five years. 
Sucralfate versus cimetidine in the treatment of reflux esophagitis, with special reference to the esophageal motor function. Sixty patients entered a double-blind clinical trial comparing the effect of 1 g of sucralfate granulate given four times daily and cimetidine, 400 mg twice daily. Twenty-six patients treated with sucralfate and 26 treated with cimetidine were examined with short-term pH monitoring before and after 12 weeks of treatment. Thirty patients, 19 treated with cimetidine and 11 treated with sucralfate, had esophageal motility studied by a radionuclide test before and after 12 weeks of treatment. The efficacy of the treatments was judged by symptoms and endoscopic response after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. The endpoint healing rate was approximately 60% in both groups and symptoms were relieved in half of the patients in both groups (difference not significant). The effect of the treatments on pH and number of spikes reflected the different pharmacodynamic profiles of the drugs, whereas the mean transit time (MTT) was not changed by the treatments. The residual activity after radionuclide transit in the sitting position was significantly increased after treatment with cimetidine. The data support the hypothesis that primary dysmotility might be involved in the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis in about 33% of the patients. Possibilities for a combination therapy with sucralfate and cimetidine are stressed. 
Nifedipine reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and transient ischemia in patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting. A randomized study was performed on 104 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting to examine whether the infusion of nifedipine (n = 53) reduces the incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia and necrosis in the early postoperative period. Continuous hemodynamic and three-channel Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours and serial assessment of serum enzymes and 12-lead electrocardiography were performed for 36 hours postoperatively. Nifedipine (minimum dose, 10 micrograms/kg/hr for 24 hours) was applied from the onset of extracorporal circulation. The control group (n = 51) received nitroglycerin (minimum dose, 1 micrograms/kg/min for 24 hours). Using the combined analyses of electrocardiography and Holter recordings, myocardial ischemia was defined as being either a transient ischemic event (TIE), transient coronary spasm (TCS), or myocardial infarction (MI). The two groups did not differ with respect to preoperative New York Heart Association classification, age, history of myocardial infarction, extracorporal circulation and aortic cross-clamp time, number of distal anastomoses, or systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. The incidence of perioperative myocardial ischemia was substantially lower in the nifedipine than in the nitroglycerin group [TIE: three of 53 patients (6%) versus nine of 50 patients (18%), p less than 0.001; MI: two of 53 patients (4%) versus six of 50 patients (12%), p less than 0.001; and TCS: none of 53 patients (0%) versus two of 50 patients (4%), p = NS]. 
The plain abdominal film accurately estimates extent of active ulcerative colitis. The aim of our study was to establish whether plain abdominal film can accurately assess the extent of active ulcerative colitis. Ninety-seven ulcerative colitis patients were studied, in whom the extent of the macroscopic lesion was established either by colonoscopy (n = 75) or by resection (n = 22). Of these, 42 had proctosigmoiditis, 12 left-sided colitis, 12 subtotal colitis, and 31 total colitis. Nine well-tested features were used for the radiological classification of lesion extent. The radiologists were not given any clinical information. Seventy-eight patients (80.4%) were correctly classified by plain abdominal film (r = 0.86); the best concordance was achieved for proctosigmoiditis and total colitis (80.9 and 90.3%, respectively). In total colitis the most reliable radiological features were "irregularity of the mucosal edge" and "increased thickness of the colon wall, " which were present in 74.2 and 67.7%, respectively, of the correctly classified patients. The fourfold combination of these two features with "loss of haustral clefts" and "empty right colon" was present only in patients with total colitis, and at least one of these features was present in all but one of them. Conversely, all nine abnormalities were absent in 73.8% of patients with proctosigmoiditis. In conclusion, plain abdominal film is a reliable tool for judging the extent of lesion in active ulcerative colitis. It seems particularly accurate in total colitis, where, in the acute phases, it is most important to avoid invasive examinations. 
Phencyclidine increased release of beta-endorphin from anterior lobe of the pituitary. Phencyclidine (PCP) has been found to affect neuroendocrine function by altering the release of the anterior pituitary hormones, adrenocorticotrophin, luteinizing hormone and prolactin. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of PCP on release of the two pituitary hormones also derived from the adrenocorticotropin precursor, namely, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin (beta-E), synthesized in the neurointermediate and anterior lobes of the pituitary. At behaviorally active doses, PCP administered i.c.v. increased plasma levels of immunoreactive beta-E (i beta-E) without affecting the concentration of immunoreactive alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, suggesting that PCP increased the release of beta-E from only the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Dexamethasone pretreatment blocked the PCP-induced increase in i beta-E which indicated further the anterior lobe effects of PCP. MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate), a selective PCP ligand, at behaviorally active doses also increased the plasma concentration of i beta-E. The dose-response curves for induction of behavior was very different from that for increasing the concentration of i beta-E in plasma. The increase in release of i beta-E was stereoselective as (+)-(1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3 methylpiperidine but not (-)-(1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3 methylpiperidine increased release of i beta-E. The increase in plasma levels of beta-E was not due to an interaction with opioid receptors because naloxone did not block PCP-induced release of beta-E. In vitro, PCP also significantly increased release of i beta-E from anterior lobe of the pituitary. 
A phase II trial of intraperitoneal cisplatin and etoposide as salvage treatment for minimal residual ovarian carcinoma. We conducted a phase II study of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP-16) as salvage therapy in patients with ovarian cancer who had persistent disease or who had relapsed after primary systemic chemotherapy and had residual disease of less than 2 cm. Two hundred eleven courses of IP chemotherapy consisting of CDDP 200 mg/m2 and VP-16 350 mg/m2 were administered. All patients received intravenous (IV) thiosulfate protection. Treatment was given once every 4 weeks for a median of six cycles. Twenty-four of 37 assessable patients were clinically free of disease at the end of treatment (normal physical exam, computed tomographic [CT] scan, CA-125 and peritoneal cytology); one patient had a partial response. Ten of these 24 patients consented to reexploration at the end of treatment, and nine were in pathologic complete remission, while one patient had positive peritoneal washings as her only evidence of persistent disease. The median survival of the 37 patients was 26 months from the first day of IP treatment and 51 months from diagnosis. The major toxicity was myelosuppression, with median nadir WBC, granulocyte, and platelet counts of 2,400, 684, and 134,000/mm3, respectively. There was no cumulative renal damage, hypomagnesemia, or chemical peritonitis. We conclude that IP CDDP and VP-16 can produce pathologic complete remissions when used as a second-line regimen for patients with ovarian cancer who have received systemic cisplatin-based therapy and have less than 2 cm disease. 
Cancer control following anatomical radical prostatectomy: an interim report. Cancer control following anatomical radical prostatectomy was evaluated in 586 men who were followed for 1 1/2 to 8 years (median followup 4 years, 166 men followed 5 years or longer). The 5-year actuarial rate was 4% for local recurrence alone, 5% for distant metastases alone, 2% for distant metastases in association with local recurrence and 3% for death of or with disease, while 10% of the men had elevated levels of prostate specific antigen without local recurrence or distant metastases. When the actuarial status at 5 years was evaluated by clinical stage there was local recurrence alone in 0% of men with a clinical stage A1 or B1 nodule, and 4% with stage B1, 7% with stage A2 and 8% with stage B2 disease. When evaluated by pathological stage at 5 years local recurrence alone was noted in 2% of men with organ-confined disease, 8% with specimen-confined disease and 8% in whom the disease involved the surgical margin, seminal vesicles or pelvic lymph nodes. Recognizing that two-thirds to three-quarters of all local recurrences occur within the first 5 years, these data suggest that the anatomical approach to radical prostatectomy is associated with local control rates that are equal to or greater than other series reported in the literature. However, without a randomized study it is impossible to compare one clinical series to another, and followup evaluations at 10 and 15 years will be necessary to confirm these findings. 
Noncardiac chest pain in patients with heart disease. This is a retrospective study of cardiac patients with noncardiac chest pain referred for evaluation of esophageal motility. Sixty-eight patients with heart disease were compared with 210 patients without heart disease according to findings from symptom questionnaires and a psychologic test (Brief Symptom Inventory). More than 70% of each group qualified for an anxiety or depressive diagnosis on the symptom questionnaire. These diagnoses were supported by significant elevations of scores on the anxiety and depression scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Male gender and a diagnosis of panic disorder occurred significantly more often in the patients with heart disease. "Stress" was cited as the cause of illness in about half the sample, but this led to less than satisfactory rates of psychiatric evaluation or pharmacotherapy. This is of particular concern for the cardiac patients because of the known adverse effect of anxiety and depression in those with heart disease. 
Predominant expression of lambda light chain in adult cases with non-T-cell acute lymphocytic and chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis. The authors investigated cytoplasmic immunoglobulins of the leukemic cells from 20 adult cases with non-T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and from three cases with chronic myelogenous leukemia in lymphoid blast crisis using immunoelectron microscopy. They also studied these cases using various monoclonal antibodies. Of the 23 examined cases, nine were negative for both heavy and light chains of immunoglobulins; the authors defined these as common ALL. Two cases were positive for the mu chain but were negative for light chains; the authors defined these as pre-B-cell ALL. The remaining 12 cases were positive for either kappa or lambda light chains; these were defined as B-cell ALL. Of the 12 cases positive for light chains, 11 were positive for the lambda chain. Seven cases of the 11 positive cases for the lambda chain were negative for heavy chains. Eleven cases were positive either for both My4 and My9 or for one of the two antibodies. From these results, the authors conclude the following: (1) the ratio of pre-B-cell ALL among non-T-cell ALL cases (two of 23 cases) was lower in adults than in children; (2) of the light chain-positive cases, the lambda light chain-positive cases predominated (11 of 12 cases); (3) heavy chain-negative, lambda chain-positive cases (seven cases) were observed; and (4) one half of the leukemia cases showed dual phenotypes of B-cell and myeloid cell lineages. 
Abnormal methylation of the calcitonin gene marks progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The clinical aspects of disease progression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are well established, but the nature of the molecular events responsible is not known. We have previously reported a consistent pattern of novel sites of methylation in the 5' region of the calcitonin (CT) gene and other chromosome 11p loci in acute myelogenous and and lymphoid leukemias. In the present study, CT gene methylation patterns were investigated in peripheral blood from 51 patients with CML. Abnormal patterns were found in only 2 of 31 patients in chronic phase, but in 5 of 8 patients in accelerated phase, and in 11 of 12 patients in blast crisis (P less than .005). For one patient studied in blast crisis, abnormal CT gene methylation was found in the peripheral blast cells but not in the granulocytes. In two of three patients studied with CML and having normal peripheral cell patterns, abnormal patterns were found in marrow blast cells. In one patient, only partial normalization of the CT gene methylation pattern was seen after chemotherapy induction of a second chronic phase and the patient relapsed 5 months later. Our findings indicate that abnormal methylation of the 5' region of the CT gene is regularly a marker of disease progression in CML which may prove clinically useful. This abnormal methylation site is part of an imbalance in DNA methylation that may play a role in the progressive genetic instability which characterizes the advancing stages of CML. 
Coronary atherosclerotic plaques with and without thrombus in ischemic heart syndromes: a morphologic, immunohistochemical, and biochemical study. We investigated incidence, severity, and distribution of coronary atherosclerosis, acute thrombosis, and plaque fissuring in ischemic heart disease (both unstable-acute syndromes and chronic ischemia) and in nonischemic controls. We also studied the structural, immunohistochemical, and biochemical profile of plaques, with and without thrombus, including morphometry, immunophenotyping of inflammatory infiltrates, cytokine presence, and ultrastructural features. Critical coronary stenosis was almost the rule in both acute and chronic ischemic series (greater than 90%) whereas it reached 50% in control subjects. Thrombosis was principally characteristic of unstable-acute ischemic syndromes (unstable angina, 32%; acute myocardial infarction, 52%; cardiac sudden death, 26%) but was also found in chronic ischemia (stable angina, 12%; ischemic cardiomyopathy, 14%) and in control subjects (4%). Plaque fissuring without thrombus occurred in low percentages in lipid-rich, severe eccentric plaques in most series. Major differences were found between pultaceous-rich versus fibrous plaques rather than between plaques with or without thrombus. Pultaceous-rich plaques were frequent in sites of critical stenosis, thrombosis, and ulceration. Inflammatory infiltrates, i.e., T cells, macrophages, and a few beta cells, mostly occurred in lipid-rich, plaques unrelated to thrombus. In adventitia, infiltrates were a common finding unrelated to any syndrome. Necrotizing cytokines such as alpha-TNF were immunohistochemically detected in macrophages, smooth muscle, and intimal cells and detected by immunoblotting in 67% of pultaceous-rich plaques, either with or without thrombus. Immune response mediators such as IL-2 were also expressed in analogous plaques but in a minor percentage (50%-40%). Media were extensively damaged in severely diseased vessels with and without thrombus. Ultrastructural study showed that the fibrous cap was either highly cellular or densely fibrillar. Intimal injury with collagen exposure was often associated with platelet adhesion, whereas foamy cell exposure was not. In conclusion, investigated parameters were essentially similar in plaques, both with and without thrombus, whereas major differences were found between pultaceous-rich and fibrous plaques. Since platelets adhere to exposed collagen and not to foam cells, the type of exposed substrates could play a major role in thrombosis. 
5-Hydroxytryptamine and the pathophysiology of migraine. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) has long been implicated in the aetiology of migraine but the evidence remains circumstantial and certainly not definitive. Numerous papers have reviewed the background which is briefly outlined here. Although the continued belief in the primary involvement of 5-HT in the genesis of a migraine attack has recently been questioned, many antimigraine drugs undeniably interact potently with 5-HT receptors. It can be argued, however, that their modest clinical benefit results from their pharmacological effects, be they mediated through 5-HT receptors or otherwise, independently of any pathophysiological involvement of endogenous 5-HT. Nevertheless, there seems convincing evidence that central release of 5-HT by various drug mechanisms causes migraine-like headache in migraineurs. It remains to be seen whether these drugs mimic the pathological event initiating the spontaneous migraine attack. Regardless of these considerations, the focus of research on 5-HT and migraine has proved to be enormously profitable over several decades, culminating recently in the identification of a novel, potentially important, antimigraine drug for the treatment of the acute attack. This drug, sumatriptan, is a selective cranial vasoconstrictor which mediates this effect by specifically activating a particular 5-HT1 receptor subtype. Undoubtedly a precise understanding of its clinical mechanism of action, which is currently being studied by a number of groups, will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of migraine. Perhaps this in turn will help in finally determining whether migraine is a vascular disease and whether or not a disturbance of 5-HT is just epiphenomenal or is truly the primary initiating pathological event. 
Beta-galactosidase tablets in the treatment of lactose intolerance in pediatrics. Lactose-intolerant children manifest diminished or nonexistent intestinal lactase activity, resulting in flatulence, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. To assess the hydrolytic capability of lactase-containing tablets taken immediately before oral lactose challenge, we studied 18 children previously identified as being lactose intolerant and having no underlying organic gastrointestinal disease. Subjects had a mean (+/- SEM) age of 11.4 +/- 3.4 years; 72% were male. At time of the study, lactase-containing tablets or placebo tablets were ingested (double-blind) immediately before drinking a solution of lactose. Breath samples were obtained for hydrogen analysis at 30-minute intervals during a 2-hour period, and clinical symptoms were monitored. In lactose-intolerant patients, hydrogen production was significantly greater following placebo (maximum hydrogen excretion, approximately 60 ppm) compared with lactase-containing tablets (maximum hydrogen excretion, 7 ppm). Increased hydrogen production was associated with clinical symptoms including abdominal pain (89% of subjects following placebo ingestion), bloating (83%), diarrhea (61%), and flatulence (44%). These results indicate, therefore, that coingestion of lactose and lactase-containing tablets significantly reduces both breath hydrogen excretion and clinical symptoms associated with lactose intolerance. 
Absorbable rings for pediatric valvuloplasty. Preliminary study. Secondary valvular stenosis is a significant risk of annular ring implantation during valvular repair in children. To avoid this problem, we have developed an absorbable prosthetic ring (APR), which induces the generation of a biologic fibroelastic ring with mitotic capability and thereby allows atrioventricular annulus growth with age. Twelve polydioxanone (PDS) biodegradable APRs were surgically implanted in immature goats. To avoid possible embolic complications from ring fragments during the absorption period, APRs were covered with an extensible sewing sheath of high-porosity polyester, allowing contact between the PDS, blood, and endocardium. Four APRs were implanted into the right atrial cavity, four in the tricuspid position, and four in the mitral position. Histological studies at 6 months showed a considerable amount of remaining PDS. At 1 year, only small residual fragments of PDS were present, surrounded by collagen and elastic fibers as well as fibroblasts with mitotic activity. This histological structure represents a new biologic fibroelastic ring, which has originated from PDS rings. Echocardiography at 12 months showed that the elasticity of APRs and fibrotic tissue allows normal systolic and diastolic valve motions. These findings, which demonstrate histological changes in native valve annuli as well as stable and elastic annuloplasty without secondary stenosis in growing animals, call for new studies involving hearts with valvular disease. 
Improvement in oxygen tensions and pulmonary blood flow with intermittent distal aortic compression during normoxia, hypoxic hypoxia, and hyperoxia in neonatal piglets. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: We investigated the hypothesis that, in a newborn piglet during normoxia, hypoxia, and hyperoxia, increasing aortic pressure transiently by intermittent short-duration aortic compression would affect left-to-right shunting of blood and thus increase pulmonary artery blood flow, pulmonary arterial PO2, and aortic PO2 proximal to the point of compression. We also investigated whether a balloon atrial septostomy, by providing an open channel for communication between the right- and left-sided circulations, would further improve pulmonary blood flow and aortic PO2. Studies were performed in eight 7- to 10-day-old newborn piglets in three phases (FIO2 of 0.21, 0.12, and 1.0) before and after balloon arterial septostomy in each piglet. Blood gas measurements and hemodynamic variables were recorded before and at the end of a 30-sec period of aortic compression. RESULTS: During aortic compression, all the animals demonstrated a 50 to 70 mm Hg increase in aortic pressure proximal to the compression. Before balloon septostomy, there were 21%, 41%, and 8% increases in aortic PO2 in the room air, hypoxic, and hyperoxic phases of the experiment, respectively. There were also statistically significant increments in pulmonary blood flow and arterial pressures. After balloon septostomy, there were 35%, 25%, and 21% increments in aortic PO2 during the room air, hypoxic, and hyperoxic phases of the experiment, respectively. However, there was no statistically significant further improvement in the effects of aortic compression on PO2 with septostomy compared with those effects before septostomy. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that increasing systemic arterial pressures in order to forcibly affect left-to-right shunting of blood may be potentially beneficial in the management of hypoxia in situations where low pulmonary artery blood flow may be contributing to hypoxia, e.g., in persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. 
Pathophysiology of ischaemia reperfusion injury: central role of the neutrophil. Ischaemia is a common clinical event leading to local and remote injury. Evidence indicates that tissue damage is largely caused by activated neutrophils which accumulate when the tissue is reperfused. If the area of ischaemic tissue is large, neutrophils also sequester in the lungs, inducing non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. Ischaemia reperfusion injury is initiated by production of reactive oxygen species which initially appear responsible for the generation of chemotactic activity for neutrophils. Later, once adherent to endothelium, neutrophils mediate damage by secretion of additional reactive oxygen species as well as proteolytic enzymes, in particular elastase. Therapeutic options for limiting ischaemia reperfusion injury include inhibition of oxygen radical formation, pharmacological prevention of neutrophil activation and chemotaxis, and also the use of monoclonal antibodies which prevent neutrophil-endothelial adhesion, a prerequisite for injury. 
Hemostatic wrapping of ruptured liver in two postpartum patients. A variety of surgical techniques with variable success rates have been reported in the management of the spontaneously ruptured liver in pregnancy. We managed two cases of postpartum ruptured liver by wrapping the liver in hemostatic material. Hemostatic encapsulation effectively controlled massive bleeding of ruptured livers in two postpartum patients. 
Dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency. A genetic disorder of cardiovascular regulation. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase (DBH) deficiency is a genetic disorder in which affected patients cannot synthesize norepinephrine, epinephrine, and octopamine in either the central nervous system or the peripheral autonomic neurons. Dopamine acts as a false neurotransmitter in their noradrenergic neurons. Neonates with DBH deficiency have had episodic hypothermia, hypoglycemia, and hypotension, but survivors sometimes cope relatively well until late childhood when overwhelming orthostatic hypotension profoundly limits their activities. The hypotension may be so severe that clonic seizures supervene. Most currently recognized patients are young or middle-aged adults. The diagnosis is established by the observation of severe orthostatic hypotension in a patient whose plasma norepinephrine/dopamine ratio is much less than one. 
High-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of experimental liver cancer. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) was used to treat Morris rat hepatoma 3924A implanted in the liver. Treatment was administered with a lens-focused 4-MHz transducer that created a focused beam of 550 W/cm2 at peak intensity. One hundred twelve rats with liver tumors were divided into two groups of 56 each. Group 1 received HIFU therapy while group 2 (the control group) did not. All rats were killed immediately or 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days after treatment. Eight rats in each group were killed at each interval for pathologic and biochemical studies. Significant inhibition of the tumor growth was seen in the HIFU-treated group, with tumor growth inhibition rates of 65.4% to 93.1% from the third to the 28th day after treatment. Ultrasound-treated tumors showed direct thermal cytotoxic necrosis and fibrosis. An additional 56 ACl rats with liver tumors were divided into four groups of 14 each. Group 1 received doxorubicin hydrochloride intraperitoneally and HIFU therapy; group 2, HIFU therapy; group 3, doxorubicin hydrochloride; and group 4 (the control group), neither HIFU nor doxorubicin hydrochloride. Significantly improved survival rates were noted in HIFU-treated animals (groups 1 and 2) compared with those of groups 3 and 4. These data suggest that HIFU may be a useful method for local treatment of hepatic tumors. 
Role of surgery in multimodality therapy for gastrointestinal lymphoma. Between 1973 and 1989, 49 patients with gastrointestinal lymphomas were treated at the Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, and followed in the tumor registry. The purpose of this review was to determine the influence of treatment on long-term survival of these patients. The mean age was 63 years (range: 38 to 83 years). There were 33 men and 16 women. The primary tumor sites were gastric 33 (67%), small bowel 11 (22%), and colon 5 (10%). Common signs and/or symptoms at presentation were pain (n = 38), bleeding (n = 11), and weight loss (n = 14). The diagnostic sensitivities of contrast radiography, computed tomography, and endoscopic biopsy were 76%, 89%, and 79%, respectively. Forty-eight patients were treated, and one received supportive care only. Thirty-one patients had surgical resections, 33 patients had chemotherapy, and 16 patients had radiotherapy. Most (n = 30) had multimodality treatment. Statistically significant variables affecting survival rates in patients with gastric lymphomas were lower tumor stage, younger patient age, and surgical resection. 
Steatocystoma multiplex: appearance at mammography. The authors present mammographic findings in a patient with steatocystoma multiplex. Numerous oil cysts were seen in both breasts at mammography. The mammographic appearance is characteristic of, if not pathognomonic for, steatocystoma multiplex. 
Alterations of platelet membrane microviscosity in essential hypertension. 1. The metabolism of blood platelets, taken as an accessible model of excitable cells, has been reported to be altered in hypertension. Most of the identified alterations concern the functions of various plasma membrane constituents. 2. A possible modification of membrane microviscosity was investigated by 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene and 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence depolarization. In order to determine whether or not the membrane structures probed by these indicators were related to platelet physiological functions, the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration was determined in parallel. 3. At physiological temperature, the fluorescence anisotropy of 1-[4-(trimethylamino)phenyl]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene was decreased in untreated hypertensive patients (0.276 +/- 0.002 versus 0.288 +/- 0.002, n = 23 and 22, P less than 0.001), indicating a lowered microviscosity at the lipid-water interface of cell membrane. It correlated inversely with blood pressure (P less than 0.001) and cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration (P less than 0.030). On the contrary, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene fluorescence anisotropy was observed to vary with sex but not with blood pressure. 4. These results suggest that structural membrane modifications may participate in the various functional abnormalities observed in platelets from hypertensive patients. 
Bursitis of the tensor veli palatini muscle with an osteophyte on the pterygoid hamulus. Many patients with temporomandibular joint dysfunction and/or myofascial pain syndrome have numerous symptoms. In cases of multiple complaints, an attempt should be made to resolve symptoms on a step-by-step basis. In this case report, a patient was treated for only one of her numerous complaints, that is, a burning sensation on her palate when she touched the right tuberosity area with her tongue or finger. 
Oxygen transport in adult respiratory distress syndrome and other acute circulatory problems: relationship of oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the evidence that oxygen consumption (VO2) is pathologically dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2). DATA SOURCES: Studies published since 1972 with their relevant bibliographies and computerized search of MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: All clinical papers reporting the relationship of: VO2 to DO2 in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis, other critically ill patients, and normal individuals; cardiac output determined by measured VO2 to calculated VO2 from the arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference; blood lactate to DO2; and selected basic science studies. DATA EXTRACTION: Study quality was assessed and all pertinent data were summarized. RESULTS OF DATA EXTRACTION: Normal individuals display physiologic dependence of VO2 at very low levels of DO2 (330 mL/min.m2). Pathologic dependence of VO2 on DO2 entails two concepts: a) VO2 varies directly with DO2 over a wide range of DO2 and b) of particular import, tissue oxygen extraction is compromised. This pathologic supply dependence was initially identified in patients with ARDS; subsequently, it has been demonstrated in patients with sepsis and in a variety of other critically ill individuals. There are substantial, but not uniform, data documenting this dependence of VO2 on DO2 in ARDS. In some studies, this relationship correlates best with increased lactate concentrations. However, increased blood lactate concentrations do not accurately track other evidence of tissue hypoxia. Some researchers have attributed the finding of this supply dependency to artifact, when VO2 is determined by the arterial-mixed venous oxygen difference. However, when these methods are compared, the correlation is excellent. Others have raised the concern that appreciable changes in VO2, even over short periods of time, may result in physiologic increases in DO2. However, when "control" groups have been contemporaneously compared with patients with ARDS using the same methodology, they have not shown supply dependency. Interwoven throughout the studies reviewed is overwhelming and uniform evidence that both mixed venous oxygen tension (PVO2) and mixed venous oxygen content (CVO2) correlate poorly with cardiac output, DO2, or VO2. The inconsistencies in identifying pathologic DO2 dependency may well reflect the unknown variables that exist in patients with ARDS, perhaps better labeled, multiple organ system failure. CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic dependence of VO2 on DO2, especially the inability to increase tissue oxygen extraction, is present in most patients with ARDS and many other critically ill individuals. PVO2 and CVO2 are both unreliable indicators of cardiac output, DO2, or VO2. 
Long-term patency of the aortofemoral Dacron graft. A graft limb related study over a 25-years period. Graft limb patency was studied retrospectively in a consecutive series of 912 patients (1605 limbs), who received an aorto(bi)femoral Dacron graft for occlusive disease over a 25 years period (1963-1987). The mean follow-up for the series was 5.35 years (range 1 month to 23 years) and 18.5% of the patients were followed for at least 10 years. Primary patency decreased progressively to 83% at 10 years and 77% at 15 years. It was significantly improved to 90% (at 10 years) and 84% (at 15 years) by means of operative thrombectomy (secondary patency). Factors influencing patency (univariate analysis) were (1) concomitant femoropopliteal occlusive disease, (2) the site of the femoral anastomosis and (3) the date of the operation. Multivariate analysis in relation to the femoral anastomosis stressed the importance of profunda femoris artery disease and the date of operation. It is concluded that the negative effects of concomitant superficial femoral artery disease may be completely relieved by an adequate profundaplasty. Furthermore the substantial progress, we documented over the years of the study, supports our view that aortofemoral reconstruction may also be offered as the solution of choice to patients with milder forms of claudication. 
Behavioral arousal in newborn infants and its association with termination of apnea. Arousal is an important protective mechanism that aids in the resolution of obstructive sleep apnea in adults and children, but its role in neonatal apnea has not been investigated. The primary aim of the present study was to determine the role of arousal in the termination of apnea in preterm infants. Videorecording was used to identify spontaneous behavioral arousal in a group of healthy full-term (n = 7) and preterm (n = 10) infants before and during polygraphic monitoring of cardiorespiratory variables and in a group of preterm infants with apnea (n = 10) during similar polygraphic monitoring. Spontaneous arousal rates (mean +/- SE) in full-term infants before and during polygraphic monitoring were 0.18 +/- 0.03 and 0.23 +/- 0.07 episodes/min, respectively. Corresponding values in nonapneic preterm infants were 0.24 +/- 0.03 and 0.24 +/- 0.02 episodes/min. In apneic preterm infants, mean spontaneous arousal rate during polygraphic recording was 0.26 +/- 0.02, but it was considerably higher during apneic sleep periods (0.59 +/- 0.17) than during nonapneic sleep periods (0.25 +/- 0.01). The frequency of occurrence of arousal was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) in long vs. short apnea, mixed vs. central apnea, and severe vs. mild apnea. Although a clear association between arousal and apneic resolution was observed in preterm infants, lack of arousal responses in a large number of apneic episodes suggests that behavioral arousal is not essential for the termination of apnea in these infants. 
Superiority of granisetron to dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis. Trials of selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonists have shown excellent antiemetic activity for chemotherapy containing cisplatin when compared with high-dose metoclopramide. There is little information about the efficacy of these new agents for chemotherapy other than for high-dose cisplatin. We performed a double-blind, randomized trial comparing a single dose of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonist granisetron (BRL 43694A) as a single intravenous dose with dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in 152 patients receiving their first course of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (mainly doxorubicin- and cyclophosphamide-containing combinations). During the first 24 hours, there was a statistically significant advantage for the granisetron group in terms of the prevention of both nausea and emesis. There was no difference in the frequency of reported adverse events. We conclude that granisetron is more effective than dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in patients who are receiving moderately emetogenic cytotoxic agents. 
Pulsed-spray thrombolysis of arterial and bypass graft occlusions. Pulsed-spray thrombolysis is accomplished through forceful injection of a spray of highly concentrated urokinase into clot by using catheters with multiple side holes. We previously reported the immediate technical efficacy of the method in eight arterial and 10 bypass graft occlusions. We now describe the clinical efficacy of the method in a second, larger series of 23 native artery occlusions and 25 bypass graft occlusions. Transluminal angioplasty was performed after thrombolysis in 21 of the arteries and 24 of the bypass grafts. Initial thrombolysis was observed in all artery occlusions and all but one bypass graft occlusion with an average time for pulsed-spray lysis of 65 +/- 28 min in native arteries and 93 +/- 38 min in bypass grafts. Recanalization with improvement in symptoms or distal pulses after thrombolysis and angioplasty was achieved in 74% of treated arterial occlusions and 92% of treated graft occlusions. Of the 15 arteries that were recanalized and did not require adjunctive surgery, seven remained patent at 3-28 months follow-up. Nine of 23 recanalized bypass grafts required early adjunctive surgery. Of the nine synthetic and five saphenous vein grafts successfully recanalized and not requiring surgical revision, the mean patency was 4.3 +/- 3.1 months and 3.0 +/- 2.2 months, respectively. Minor complications were seen in 23% of cases. The two major complications (4%) involved one groin hematoma requiring surgery and one episode of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We conclude that combined pulsed-spray thrombolysis and angioplasty achieve rapid and consistent arterial and graft recanalization with minimal risk. The method offers a favorable alternative to standard thrombolytic therapy of arterial occlusions. In occluded synthetic and vein bypass grafts, the technique is sometimes beneficial, either alone or combined with surgical revision. 
Globus pharyngeus: long-term follow-up and prognostic factors. A prospective trial of 80 patients with globus pharyngeus is reported. An in-depth analysis of the typical history at presentation is given. The average follow-up period was 27 months (range, 21 to 42 months). The asymptomatic rate at this interval was 25%, with a further 35% reporting a significant improvement in symptoms. Three independent factors were found to influence prognosis (p less than .05). These were sex, length of history at consultation, and the presence or absence of associated throat symptoms. Male patients having a history of the globus symptom for less than 3 months and not complaining of any associated throat symptoms had the best chance of becoming asymptomatic or symptomatically improved. The presence or absence of heartburn or its treatment had no bearing on outcome. 
A cohort study of stomach cancer in a high-risk American population. Demographic, smoking and dietary information was obtained from a cohort of 17,633 white American men, largely of Scandinavian and German descent, who responded to a mailed questionnaire in 1966. After 20 years of follow-up, 50% to 90% increases in mortality from stomach cancer (75 deaths) were found among foreign-born, their children, and among residents of the North Central states. An association was seen with low educational attainment and laboring or semiskilled occupations, primarily among immigrants and their children. Risk was evaluated in subjects who regularly smoked cigarettes (RR = 2.6, 95% CI = 1.1 to 5.8). A significant dose-response trend was observed, with subjects who smoked 30 or more cigarettes per day having more than a five-fold increased risk compared with those who never smoked. Elevated risks were also found for pipe smoking and smokeless tobacco use, but not for alcohol consumption. Analysis of dietary consumption of nine food groups revealed no significant associations with stomach cancer. However, total carbohydrate intake and a few individual food items (salted fish, bacon, cooked cereal, milk, and apples) were associated with increased risk. The findings of this prospective study of a high-risk population add to the limited evidence relating tobacco consumption to stomach cancer risk and suggest clues to ethnic, geographic, and dietary risk factors. 
False-positive immunostaining of normal epithelia and carcinomas with ascites fluid preparations of antimelanoma monoclonal antibody HMB45. HMB45 is a melanoma-specific monoclonal antibody that has found widespread use in diagnostic pathology. Recent reports, however, have suggested that this antibody may cross-react with a small number of carcinomas and other epithelial cells. The authors tested the hypothesis that these latter reports represent examples of false-positive immunostaining by comparing the immunostaining on breast, salivary gland, and lung tumors with the following: (1) a commercial ascites preparation of this monoclonal antibody; (2) a protein A-purified antibody preparation derived from ascites fluid; and (3) supernatant fluid obtained from the hybridoma cell line. The authors found that all examples of nonmelanoma immunostaining in the carcinomas tested were eliminated with the nonascites fluid preparations, whereas strong immunostaining of melanomas was retained. The authors conclude that contaminated commercial ascites fluid preparations of HMB45 may account for most, if not all, of the reports of nonmelanoma immunostaining with HMB45. 
Evaluation of right ventricular regional perfusion with technetium-99m-sestamibi SPECT. To evaluate technetium-99m-sestamibi as a right ventricular perfusion imaging agent, 25 normal volunteers and 25 patients with suspected coronary disease were studied with both sestamibi and thallium-201 SPECT. All patients underwent cardiac characterization. Compared to thallium-201 images, visualization of the right ventricle was superior for sestamibi in all cases. After computer masking of the left ventricle, count profiles for each 6-mm right ventricular short-axis slice were extracted and plotted in a bull's-eye type polar map with images normalized to maximal right ventricular counts. On sestamibi right ventricular polar maps, 7 of 11 patients (64%) with right coronary stenosis had fixed or reversible inferior right ventricular defects. None of the 25 volunteers or patients without right coronary stenosis had right ventricular defects (true-negative rate = 100%). We conclude that sestamibi SPECT provides an accurate means to assess right ventricular regional perfusion, with data presentation and interpretation facilitated by the polar map display. 
Lack of increased bleeding after liver biopsy in patients with mild hemostatic abnormalities. Prophylactic transfusions of fresh frozen plasma and platelets are sometimes given to patients with mild elevations in prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and mild thrombocytopenia before percutaneous liver biopsy. To determine whether PTs and PTTs 1.1-1.5 times midrange normal levels and platelet counts 50-99 x 10(9)/L are associated with increased bleeding complications, hospital records of all patients who underwent percutaneous liver biopsy during 56 consecutive months (n = 291) were reviewed. Complete information was available for 177 inpatient procedures (155 standard, 22 fine needle). Overall, the frequency of bleeding complications in patients with platelet counts greater than or equal to 50 X 10(9)/L was 3.4% (6 of 175), with no significant difference between patients with mild hemostatic abnormalities and patients with normal parameters. These data suggest that prophylactic transfusions may not be necessary. One factor was highly associated with bleeding complications: a patient diagnosis of malignancy, 14% (7 of 50) compared with 0.8% (1 of 127) among other patients (P less than 0.001). These patients should be monitored closely after biopsy. 
Serum gastrin increases with increasing dietary calcium but not with increasing dietary fat or fiber in Fischer-344 rats. We studied the effects of dietary calcium, fat and fiber on serum gastrin in Fischer-344 rats in a full factorial experiment as part of a larger study of diet and colon cancer risk factors. Nine- to 10-wk-old male rats were fed standard or experimental diets for 4 wk. Wheat bran was the sole source of fiber. Wheat bran levels were 0, 2.5, 10 and 20%; fat levels were 1, 5 and 10%; calcium levels were 0.18, 0.52 and 1.04% of diet weight. On d 29 serum was collected and stored at -80 degrees C until analyzed. There was a significant (P less than 0.0001) dose-dependent increase in serum gastrin from 102 to 173 ng/L, with increasing calcium. No other significant changes in serum gastrin were noted with the dietary changes. A long-term change in the level of serum gastrin, caused by dietary modification, will influence the trophic effect that gastrin has on colonic mucosa as well as on colon carcinomas. We speculate that calcium supplementation, although slowing colonic proliferation, might have an undesirable effect on the growth of early undetected colonic tumors. 
The detrimental effects of intravenous crystalloid after aortotomy in swine We tested the hypothesis that, after aortotomy, rapidly replacing three times the blood volume deficit with intravenous crystalloid will increase hemorrhage and decrease survival. Sixteen anesthetized Yorkshire swine underwent splenectomy and stainless steel wire placement in the infrarenal aorta and were instrumented with pulmonary artery and carotid artery catheters. The wire was pulled, producing a 5 mm aortotomy and spontaneous intraperitoneal hemorrhage. The animals had been alternately assigned to either an untreated control group (n = 8) or a treatment group (n = 8), which received 80 ml/kg lactated Ringer's solution intravenously. The volume of hemorrhage and the mortality rate were significantly increased (p less than 0.05) in the treatment group receiving lactated Ringer's solution relative to the control animals (2142 +/- 178 ml versus 783 +/- 85 ml, and eight of eight animals versus zero of eight animals, respectively). From these data we conclude that, in this model of uncontrolled arterial hemorrhage resulting from abdominal aortotomy, rapidly administering lactated Ringer's solution intravenously significantly increases hemorrhage and death. 
Anti-B-cell monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of severe B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome following bone marrow and organ transplantation. BACKGROUND. The B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome is an infrequent life-threatening complication of marrow or organ transplantation that is the consequence of profound immunosuppression. The results of treatment have been disappointing, although a small number of patients have been cured by chemoradiotherapy or antiviral agents after a reduction in the dosage of immunosuppressive therapy. We report here the results of treating this disorder with anti-B-cell antibodies. METHODS. Twenty-six patients in whom aggressive B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome developed after bone marrow (n = 14) or organ (n = 12) transplantation received 0.2 mg of CD21-specific and of CD24-specific antibodies per kilogram of body weight for 10 consecutive days in an open, prospective, multicenter trial. RESULTS. The treatment was well tolerated. All patients had transient neutropenia, apparently because the CD24 molecule is also expressed on granulocytes. The treatment was ineffective in seven patients with monoclonal B-cell proliferation. In contrast, 16 patients with oligoclonal B-cell proliferation had complete remission. Systemic remission also occurred in two other patients with oligoclonal proliferation who had central nervous system involvement, although they subsequently died because of progression of the central nervous system disease. In one patient who died early, clonality was not determined. Of the 16 patients who had complete remission, 2 with persistent immunodeficiency due to graft (marrow) rejection or acute graft-versus-host disease had a relapse, and the 1 with graft-versus-host disease subsequently died. Eleven patients were alive and disease-free after a median follow-up of 35 months (5 of 14 marrow recipients and 6 of 12 organ recipients). Four other patients in complete remission died of unrelated causes 4 to 12 months after treatment. CONCLUSIONS. Intravenous administration of anti-B-cell antibodies may be effective in controlling diffuse, severe, oligoclonal B-cell proliferation not involving the central nervous system. 
Excision of cavernous angioma with preservation of coexisting venous angioma. Case report. The case of a patient presenting with dysphasic seizures due to a cavernous angioma coexisting with a venous malformation is reported. The cavernous angioma was resected with preservation of the venous malformation, as confirmed by postoperative studies. The patient was seizure-free following surgery. 
Effects of spinal kappa-opioid receptor agonists on the responsiveness of nociceptive superficial dorsal horn neurons. Spinal cord application of the kappa-opioid receptor agonists dynorphin (50 nmol) or (1S,2S)U-50,488H (0.19-1.9 mumol) produced changes in the excitability of some superficial dorsal horn nociceptive neurons. One-third of the cells exhibited expansion of their receptive fields as defined using mechanical stimuli following a spinal kappa agonist (dynorphin or U-50,488H); receptive field expansions were of the same order as those observed immediately after a conditioning electrical stimulus applied to a peripheral nerve. In addition, spinal U-50,488H produced changes in mechanical and thermal thresholds of the majority of superficial dorsal horn neurons. These changes were dose-dependent. Facilitation of responses occurred at lower doses and inhibition occurred primarily at higher doses, but these effects were not reversed by subsequent administration of naloxone. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that one action of increases in spinal dynorphin levels due to peripheral inflammation, tissue injury or nerve damage, is to contribute to enhanced neuronal excitability in superficial dorsal horn neurons. 
Thyroid cancer: a lethal endocrine neoplasm. This conference focuses on the controversies about managing thyroid cancer, emphasizing the possibility that the treatment of patients with potentially fatal thyroid cancer may be improved. Although the mortality rate from thyroid cancer is low, it is the highest among cancers affecting the endocrine glands (excluding the ovary). Exposure to radiation during childhood in the 1930s and 1940s increased the incidence of but not the mortality from thyroid cancer, because these tumors are mainly papillary cancers developing in young adults. These rates may change as the exposed cohort ages. Risk factors that increase mortality include older patient age and the growth characteristics of the tumor at diagnosis, the presence of distant metastases, and cell type (for example, the tall-cell variants of papillary cancer, follicular cancer [to be distinguished from the more benign follicular variant of papillary cancer], medullary cancer, and anaplastic cancer). Local metastases in lymph nodes do not seem to increase the risk for death from papillary cancer, but they do increase the risk for death from follicular and medullary cancer. In the latter, mortality is decreased by the early detection and treatment of patients with the familial multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome 2a. There are excellent tumor markers for differentiated cancer of the parafollicular and of the follicular cells (serum calcitonin and serum thyroglobulin levels, respectively). Measuring the calcitonin level allows early diagnosis of familial medullary cancer, whereas measuring the thyroglobulin level, although useful only after total thyroidectomy, allows early recognition of recurrence or metastases of papillary or follicular cancer. Initial surgery, protocols for follow-up, and the use of radioiodine for the ablation of any residual thyroid and the treatment of metastatic cancer are discussed. Because these tumors resist currently available chemotherapy regimens, possible ways to increase the effectiveness of radioiodine therapy are considered as are new approaches to treatment. 
Cancer risk after iodine-131 therapy for hyperthyroidism. Cancer incidence was studied in 10,552 patients (mean age, 57 years) who received 131I therapy (mean dose, 506 MBq) for hyperthyroidism between 1950 and 1975. Follow-up on these patients was continued for an average of 15 years. Record linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register for the period 1958-1985 identified 1543 cancers occurring 1 year or more after 131I treatment, and the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.06 (95% confidence interval = 1.01-1.11). Significantly increased SIRs were observed for cancers of the lung (SIR = 1.32; n = 105) and kidney (SIR = 1.39; n = 66). Among 10-year survivors, significantly elevated risks were seen for cancers of the stomach (SIR = 1.33; n = 58), kidney (SIR = 1.51; n = 37), and brain (SIR = 1.63; n = 30). Only the risk for stomach cancer, however, increased over time (P less than .05) and with increasing activity administered (P = not significant). The risk for malignant lymphoma was significantly below expectation (SIR = 0.53; n = 11). Overall cancer risk did not increase with administered 131I dose or with time since exposure. The absence of any increase in leukemia adds further support to the view that a radiation dose delivered gradually over time is less carcinogenic than the same total dose received over a short time. Only for stomach cancer was a possible radiogenic excess suggested. 
Recovery of CD3+ and CD5- lymphocyte subpopulation after autologous bone marrow transplantation and chemotherapy. Although most circulating T cells in normal subjects express both CD3 and CD5 antigens on the cell surface, a small number lack the CD5 antigen. Recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants develop increased numbers of CD3+ CD5- cells, particularly those who develop graft versus host disease (GVHD). This CD3+ CD5- population may rise transiently in patients who have received an autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) and in patients following completion of intensive chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). These findings suggest that these CD3+ CD5- cells are a normal component of the regenerating lymphoid system after BMT or chemotherapy. 
Use of light reflection rheography for diagnosis of axillary or subclavian venous thrombosis. Noninvasive diagnosis of axillary and subclavian venous thrombosis or documentation of the post-thrombotic syndrome using modalities currently in use is not definitive. Light reflection rheography, which is a reflection of venous pressure changes in the extremity as recorded from the subdermal capillary plexus, was used to correctly diagnose axillary or subclavian venous thrombosis in 11 patients. A positive study was confirmed by phlebography in each instance. There were no instances of false-positive results. The methodology is simple, involving testing of the venous outflow from the upper extremity in response to exercise, application of venous congesting pressure, and measurement of the rate of venous outflow when the congesting pressure is released. Normal respiratory variations of an open venous system are also assessed by this noninvasive modality. The tracing obtained is easy to interpret and provides objective evidence of proximal venous occlusion. The test is not operator-dependent and the instrumentation is relatively inexpensive. We believe that light reflection rheography may be an exciting development in the noninvasive diagnosis of axillary or subclavian venous compromise and merits further trials. 
Congenital optic tract syndrome. We describe two patients with complete homonymous hemianopia who were unaware of their visual field defects. The clinical impression of an optic tract syndrome was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging, which showed absence of the corresponding tract in each case. The pathogenesis of congenital absence of the optic tract is unclear but it could represent either a primary failure of development or secondary atrophy due to focal injury during the perinatal period. 
Diagnostic implications of spectral and temporal analysis of the entire cardiac cycle in patients with ventricular tachycardia BACKGROUND. Available methods for analysis of signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) have a low-positive predictive accuracy for identifying patients at risk for ventricular arrhythmias. Identification of the spectral and temporal features in ECGs that distinguish patients prone to ventricular tachycardia (VT) is a prerequisite to implementing refinements in methods that increase the diagnostic power of the signal-averaged ECG. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fast Fourier transforms and time-domain reconstructions based on inverse fast Fourier transforms were computed over the entire cardiac cycle of signal-averaged ECGs of sinus beats from 40 patients with myocardial infarction and sustained VT, 41 with infarction without VT, and 20 normal controls. Ventricular depolarization and repolarization were analyzed by procedures that obviate limited resolution due to short data segments and window functions. Spectral magnitudes of ECGs from patients in each group were compared, and the phase data were used for time-domain reconstructions to determine the temporal distributions of distinguishing frequency bands during the cardiac cycle. Magnitudes of 1-7-Hz frequencies were increased (from p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.00001), and magnitudes of 13-56-Hz and 70-128-Hz frequencies were decreased (from p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.00001) in the spectra of ECGs from patients with VT compared with patients without VT. Time-domain reconstructions demonstrated that 1-7-Hz frequencies were detectable throughout the QRS complex, ST segment, and T wave in ECGs from each group. The 13-56-Hz and 70-128-Hz frequency bands not only contributed to the terminal QRS and ST segment but were also detectable throughout the QRS complex of ECGs from patients with VT. CONCLUSIONS. Results define new spectral and temporal features in signal-averaged ECGs from patients with VT that are excluded from analysis by available techniques that limit the bandwidth or restrict interrogation to portions of the cardiac cycle. These findings provide an objective basis for developing new indexes for signal-averaged ECG analysis. 
Effect of theophylline on sleep and sleep-disordered breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. To investigate the effect of theophylline on sleep and sleep-disordered breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), we studied 12 male nonhypercapnic subjects with a mean +/- SEM age of 62.8 +/- 2.5 yr and a FEV1 of 1.36 +/- 0.11 L using a randomized double-blind crossover protocol. Sustained-action theophylline (250 mg three times or four times a day) or placebo was administered for 2 days, and the alternate drug was administered on the following 2 days. Sleep studies were performed on Nights 2 and 4 with spirometry at 9:00P.M. and 7:00A.M. Two puffs of metaproterenol or albuterol were administered at 10:00P.M. on both study nights. A theophylline level, drawn at bedtime (10:00 to 11:00P.M.), was 14.2 +/- 0.78 micrograms/ml on the theophylline nights and less than 2 on placebo nights. The morning FEV1 was significantly better during theophylline administration (1.27 +/- 0.12 versus 1.00 +/- 0.11 L, p less than 0.001). The mean arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide pressure (PCO2) were also better during NREM sleep on theophylline nights. Neither the mean SaO2 and transcutaneous PCO2 during REM sleep nor the apnea plus hypopnea index (events per hour of sleep) differed between placebo and theophylline nights. Theophylline administration did not impair the amount or architecture of sleep as neither total sleep time nor the fraction of time spent in Stages 1, 2, and 3/4 and REM differed between the two regimens. The number of arousals per hour of sleep was slightly less on theophylline nights (19.9 +/- 1.7 versus 24.9 +/- 2.7, p less than 0.05). 
Psychiatric illness and irritable bowel syndrome: a comparison with inflammatory bowel disease Structured psychiatric interviews and psychological self-report measures were administered to 28 patients with irritable bowel syndrome and 19 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Significantly more of the patients with irritable bowel syndrome had lifetime diagnoses of major depression, somatization disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobic disorder. They had significantly more medically unexplained somatic symptoms, and most had suffered from psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety disorders, before the onset of their irritable bowel symptoms. 
Persistent extrapyramidal syndrome with dystonia and rigidity caused by combined metoclopramide and prochlorperazine therapy. We have reported the case of a 58-year-old woman with cerebral palsy who experienced a persistent, generalized syndrome of dystonia and rigidity (tardive dystonia-parkinsonism) while being treated for vomiting with metoclopramide in combination with prochlorperazine. This syndrome was more severe than is typically seen in drug-induced extrapyramidal syndromes and may have contributed to her death. The extreme severity of this disorder was probably related to the use of a combination of dopamine antagonists in a patient who had premorbid cerebral dysfunction. Although dopamine antagonists should always be used with caution in individuals with cerebral dysfunction, this particular combination of antiemetics should probably be avoided in such patients. 
Coronary angiography after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. PURPOSE: To review the status of emergency, urgent, routine, and selective angiography after intravenous thrombolytic therapy. DATA SOURCES: Relevant English-language articles published from January 1985 to July 1990 were identified through MEDLINE. STUDY SELECTION: For emergency angiography, four major randomized studies were reviewed and data from nine studies that incorporated rescue coronary angioplasty were pooled for meta-analysis. For urgent angiography, two controlled trials were reviewed. Comparisons of routine and selective angiography were done using data from two dedicated, large-scale, controlled trials and the ancillary findings of four other studies of reperfusion that incorporated angiography. DATA EXTRACTION: The review emphasizes the findings from multicenter, randomized, controlled trials. DATA SYNTHESIS: Emergency coronary angiography is done primarily in preparation for primary or rescue angioplasty; the value of rescue angioplasty has yet to be assessed in a randomized trial, but technical success and reocclusion improve significantly after therapy with nonspecific plasminogen activators compared with relatively specific agents (success rate, 86% compared with 75%, respectively; P = 0.03; reocclusion rate, 10.9% compared with 26.8%, respectively; P less than 0.001). Urgent coronary angiography has value for treating recurrent ischemia, but patients who develop this complication after thrombolysis are likely to have a suboptimal outcome despite aggressive care. Studies support the use of either selective or routine angiography in uncomplicated patients after thrombolytic therapy; either approach is acceptable, but the former is more practical and may prove to be cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Optimal follow-up for patients with evolving myocardial infarction who receive thrombolysis may incorporate coronary angiography at various stages. Although our ability to noninvasively detect reperfusion, reocclusion, or viable but ischemic myocardium is limited at present, available data may assist in selecting a catheterization strategy. 
Cerebral ischemic events associated with endocarditis, retinal vascular disease, and lupus anticoagulant. PURPOSE: A group of young patients presenting with cerebral ischemic events, endocardial lesions, and lupus anticoagulant is described in order to highlight the common clinical laboratory features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen consecutive patients (10 females, age range 17 to 53 years [mean 38 years]) at onset of symptoms of cerebral ischemia who had evidence of the lupus anticoagulant syndrome and were being followed prospectively are reviewed. All patients had abnormal phospholipid-dependent coagulation test results, and most had anticardiolipin antibody at the time of presentation. Three of 14 had four or more American Rheumatism Association criteria for definite systemic lupus erythematosus and the remaining patients were considered to have primary lupus anticoagulant syndrome. RESULTS: The common features among these patients included at least one cerebral ischemic event at presentation (stroke or transient ischemic attack), or recurrent episodes suggesting cerebral ischemia (amaurosis fugax, recurrent severe migraine headaches), livedo reticularis, endocardial valvular lesions noted on echocardiography (11 mitral, two aortic valve) that were often associated with discrete vegetations, retinal vascular lesions, and computed tomographic/magnetic resonance imaging scanning or angiographic evidence of multiple cerebral infarction. Venous thromboembolic events were uncommon (three of 14). Common laboratory studies included thrombocytopenia (10 of 14), positive direct Coombs' test result (11 of 14), and hypocomplementemia (11 of 14). Follow-up after initial treatment with either salicylates or anticoagulant therapy (warfarin) for up to 10 years indicated that while many patients had recurrent symptoms suggesting cerebral ischemia, major stroke syndromes did not recur nor new episodes emerge. CONCLUSION: The combination of multiple cerebral ischemic lesions and endocardial lesions, including valvular vegetations, suggests that these cerebral ischemic events represent cerebral emboli, and that these cerebral embolic events originate from vegetative lesions on the mitral or, less commonly, aortic valve, in association with lupus anticoagulant. 
Nonsurgical treatment of drooling in a patient with closed head injury and severe dysarthria. The purpose of this investigation was to measure the effectiveness of the antimuscarinic drug atropine sulfate in the treatment of chronic drooling in a patient with a history of severe closed head injury and resultant widespread oral neuromuscular and higher cortical disturbances. Results of the A-B-A-B-A-B withdrawal paradigm, chosen to demonstrate the functional relationship between drug therapy and the degree of drooling, revealed that administration of atropine sulfate reduced by more than 50% of baseline levels the amount of resting secretion, intraoral accumulation, and pharyngeal-laryngeal pooling of saliva, with negligible side effects. These results are discussed and compared to the alternative drug and surgical approaches to treatment that have been the primary focus of recent research on drooling. 
Cardiac reperfusion damage prevented by a nitroxide free radical. Experimental evidence is presented that directly links ischemia/reperfusion injury to the formation of oxygen-derived free radicals. 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO)--a stable nitroxide radical that disproportionates superoxide radicals and oxidizes reduced metal ions required for OH. formation--was tested for its ability to prevent reperfusion damage in the isolated rat heart subjected to regional ischemia. Severe reperfusion arrhythmia--ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia--were prominent in control hearts, and their duration was significantly reduced by the presence of 0.4 or 1 mM TEMPO. TEMPO also repressed both postischemic release of lactate dehydrogenase and OH. formation. TEMPO slowed the heart rate, but compensatory pacing did not alter the dramatic effect of the nitroxide on reperfusion arrhythmia. TEMPO was partially protective when introduced at the end of ischemia but had no effect when added 1 min into reperfusion. It was concluded that both reperfusion arrhythmia and cell damage were directly related to oxidative damage incurred during the critical first minute of reperfusion. TEMPO strongly protected against reperfusion injury by preventing the formation of OH. and not by decreasing heart rate or by direct suppression of arrhythmia. 
The role of endogenous opiates in athletic amenorrhea. We hypothesized that menstrual disturbances in female athletes arise from opioid-induced abnormalities in gonadotropin and/or prolactin (PRL) secretion. To investigate this hypothesis, we measured luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and PRL levels in eumenorrheic and amenorrheic athletes during thyrotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone tests at baseline, after naloxone infusions, after exercise to exhaustion, and after similar exercise during naloxone infusions. Contrary to our hypothesis, amenorrheic runners did not have significant alterations in basal, postexercise, or stimulated hormone levels compared with eumenorrheic runners. In addition, opioid blockade by naloxone did not enhance gonadotropin release by amenorrheic athletes. 
Pentamorphone for management of postoperative pain. The efficacy, duration, and safety of the synthetic opioid pentamorphone in the treatment of acute postoperative pain were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind study of 72 patients given 0.08, 0.16, or 0.24 micrograms/kg of pentamorphone or a placebo intravenously in the recovery room after major abdominal or orthopedic surgery. Only patients given 0.24 micrograms/kg of pentamorphone experienced decreased pain intensity and increased sedation, both transient in duration. Although the two higher doses of pentamorphone delayed the patient's request for supplemental morphine, the total amount of morphine required within the first hour was not different between treatments. No acute cardiorespiratory changes were observed. Pentamorphone (0.08-0.24 micrograms/kg) was ineffective for treating acute postoperative pain after major surgery. 
Bilateral vestibular paresis: diagnosis and treatment. Patients with bilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction present a substantial diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the otologist. Caloric irrigations that suggest bilateral weakness may mislead the clinician when considerable peripheral function remains. Rotary chair testing at several frequencies is helpful in confirming the degree of residual function and may identify patients who have a better prognosis in rehabilitation. Forty-nine patients with bilateral vestibular paresis were evaluated. The diagnosis was based on caloric responses of less than 5 degrees/sec in both ears and reduced gain on rotary chair trials. Oscillopsia occurred in the minority of patients (35%) and was rare unless severe paresis was present. Episodic vertigo occurred in 43%. All patients had abnormal posturography results, with vestibular dysfunction and severe dysfunction patterns predominating. The treatment outcomes of 22 patients who underwent vestibular rehabilitation are discussed. Prevention of bilateral vestibular paresis remains a high priority. 
A clinical and experimental study on all-trans retinoic acid-treated acute promyelocytic leukemia patients. Fifty patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) have been treated with all-trans retinoic acid (RA). In vitro induced differentiation of primarily cultured bone marrow cells from the patients, colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and L-CFU colony-forming assays, and karyotype analysis were performed over the treatment course. The very high bone marrow complete remission (CR) rate (94%) suggested that all-trans RA was superior to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of APL. The leukemic clone was reduced by RA-induced terminal differentiation and loss of proliferation capacity of leukemic cells. Relapse after CR in about 40% of patients was the major reason for the failure of the RA treatment. Patients who relapsed after a chemotherapy-maintained CR could be effectively reinduced to second CR by RA. However, if relapse occurred after a CR maintained by both RA and chemotherapy, the sensitivity of newly emerged leukemic clones to RA was greatly reduced. Therefore, it is suggested that RA should be replaced by conventional chemotherapy as soon as CR is achieved. Laboratory studies proved valuable in selecting cases for RA therapy and in predicting therapeutic effects and prognosis. 
Carcinomas with metaplasia and sarcomas of the breast. The clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and flow cytometric characteristics of 34 cases of mammary carcinoma with metaplasia were compared with those of 20 cases of pure sarcoma of the breast. All 20 of the latter tumors showed the pattern of malignant fibrous histiocytoma. There were 20 cases of carcinoma with mesenchymal metaplasia, 7 cases of carcinoma with mixed epithelial (squamous) and mesenchymal metaplasia, and 7 cases of carcinoma with epithelial metaplasia (four mixed ductal/squamous and three pure squamous cell carcinomas). No patient with pure sarcoma had lymph node metastases develop; all nodal metastases were found in patients who had carcinoma with metaplasia, although in one case the carcinomatous component was seen only within a lymph node metastasis. Epithelial antigens were found not only within the epithelial elements of all cases of carcinoma, but also within the apparent mesenchymal elements of 44% of the carcinomas showing divergent differentiation. Flow cytometric analysis of eight cases of carcinoma with mesenchymal metaplasia showed aneuploidy/tetraploidy in six neoplasms. For patient management purposes, the distinction of pure sarcoma from carcinoma with metaplasia is important, but additional subclassification of carcinoma with metaplasia is of greater biologic than clinical interest. 
Granulocytic sarcoma of the ovary. An unusual case presentation. We report an unusual occurrence of granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an ovarian mass in a 46-year-old woman with a history of dysplastic nevus syndrome. During workup of the ovarian mass, the diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia was made. A fine-needle aspirate of the ovarian mass showed granulocytic sarcoma. The patient died of complications of the acute leukemia a short time later. A postmortem examination was performed, which confirmed the nature of the ovarian mass as a granulocytic sarcoma. Material was obtained for flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and histochemical studies, and electron microscopy. Ploidy analysis of the tumor showed it to be diploid with an S phase of 4.8% and a G2 + M ratio of 0.5%. To our knowledge, there is only one previous report of a primary ovarian presentation of granulocytic sarcoma, and only four cases in which granulocytic sarcoma was diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology. The association between dysplastic nevus syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in this case is discussed with reference to a review of the metachronous association between melanoma and leukemia as described in the literature. 
Oral leukoplakia and adolescent smokeless tobacco use. The recent increase in smokeless tobacco (ST) use has prompted investigators to assess the health effects of ST use. This study attempted to evaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia among adolescent users and to determine factors associated with its presence. During their annual physical examination, 1116 teenaged football players (567 black, 546 white) answered a 34-question survey and received an oral screening examination. Results indicated that 0.5% of nonusers, 1.5% of previous users, and 13% of current users had clinically evident oral leukoplakia. Factors statistically associated with higher leukoplakia rates included history of ST use, regular ST use, years of ST use, and the weekly quantity consumed. Factors not associated included use of alcohol, use of cigarettes, type of ST used, and hours of ST use. One brand of snuff was found to be associated with a relative risk of leukoplakia higher than that of another brand of snuff. Overall, in ST users oral leukoplakia was six times more likely to develop than in nonusers. Earlier ages of ST use may lead to greater periods of use (in years) and to possible increases in deleterious long-term health effects in current adolescents. 
Enteropathogens associated with acute diarrheal disease in urban infants in Sao Paulo, Brazil. To determine the prevalence and epidemiology of enteropathogens in acute infantile diarrhea, 500 infants less than or equal to 12 months of age with diarrhea and 500 age-matched control subjects coming to a Sao Paulo emergency room were studied. Enteropathogens were identified in 55% of case infants and 10% of controls; enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) of classic EPEC serotypes producing EPEC adherence factor (EAF) (26% of case infants), rotavirus (14%), Salmonella species (8%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (7%), and Shigella species (5%) were associated with diarrhea. Isolation of EAF+ classic EPEC decreased with increasing age of cases and peaked in spring, whereas rotavirus was least common in early infancy and peaked in fall and winter. Bloody stool had a 36% positive predictive value for Shigella infection, EAF+ classic EPEC were highly resistant to antimicrobial drugs. Among poor Sao Paulo infants, EAF+ classic EPEC equaled or exceeded rotavirus throughout the year as a cause of diarrhea bringing children to medical attention. 
Feeding regimens after pyloromyotomy. In a prospective randomized study three different feeding regimens after operation were compared in 74 babies with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: gradual regarding of feeds over 48 h (regimen 1), rapid regarding of feeds over 16 h (regimen 2), and initial starvation followed by full normal feeds at 24 h (regimen 3). No significant difference between the treatment groups was found either in episodes of vomiting after operation (regimen 1, 2.9 episodes in 21 patients; regimen 2, 3.6 episodes in 28 patients; regimen 3, 3.6 episodes in 25 patients) or in the mean duration of postoperative hospital stay (regimen 1, 59.3 h; regimen 2, 47.8 h; regimen 3, 56.7 h). We conclude that vomiting following pyloromyotomy is self-limiting and independent of the timetable or composition of the postoperative dietary regimen. 
Evaluation of the effect of perineuronal morphine on the quality of postoperative analgesia after axillary plexus block: a randomized double-blind study. A randomized, double-blind study was performed on 50 patients scheduled for elective hand and forearm surgery under axillary plexus block to evaluate the effect of perineuronal morphine on the quality of postoperative analgesia. Patients were divided into two groups. In group A (n = 25) 5 mg of preservative-free morphine in 1.0 mL of 0.9% saline was added to the local anesthetic solution (20 mL of 1% plain lignocaine, 20 mL of 0.5% plain bupivacaine). They also received an intramuscular placebo injection of 1.0 mL of 0.9% saline in the upper thigh. In group B (n = 25), 1.0 mL of 0.9% saline was added to the local anesthetic solution and patients received an intramuscular injection of 5 mg of preservative-free morphine in 1.0 mL of 0.9% saline in the thigh. The addition of morphine to the local anesthetic solution for the axillary block did not shorten the onset time of the block, improve the quality of postoperative pain relief, or provide longer lasting analgesia than that obtained with intramuscular morphine. 
Vascular renin-angiotensin system and neurotransmission in hypertensive persons. The existence of a vascular renin-angiotensin system and its role in modulating sympathetic activity were evaluated in forearm arterioles of hypertensive individuals. Isoproterenol (0.03, 0.01, 0.3 microgram/100 ml/min for 5 minutes each; n = 5) was infused into the brachial artery, and active and inactive renin, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine forearm balance (venous-arterial differences corrected for forearm blood flow by strain-gauge plethysmography) were measured. Isoproterenol caused vasodilation and a dose-dependent active and inactive renin, angiotensin II, and norepinephrine outflow, an effect blunted by propranolol (10 micrograms/100 ml/min). To evaluate the role of local angiotensin II on beta-mediated norepinephrine overflow, the experiment was repeated with captopril (2.5 micrograms/100 ml/min for 10 minutes; n = 5), which abolished angiotensin II release and significantly reduced norepinephrine overflow. To test whether angiotensin II facilitates both prejunctional norepinephrine release and its postjunctional action, we evaluated the effect of exogenous angiotensin II, infused into the brachial artery at low concentrations (0.001 microgram/100 ml/min), on forearm vasoconstriction and norepinephrine release induced by endogenous sympathetic activation (application of a lower body negative pressure: -10 and -20 mm Hg for 5 minutes, n = 10) and on the vasoconstrictor effect of local norepinephrine (0.0015, 0.005, 0.015, 0.05, 0.15 micrograms/100 ml/min for 3 minutes each; n = 6). Although angiotensin II increased the vasoconstricting effect and the norepinephrine release induced by lower body negative pressure, it failed to affect norepinephrine-mediated vasoconstriction. Our data indicate the existence in hypertensive individuals of a vascular renin-angiotensin system that seems to modulate sympathetic activity through the presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release. 
Impaired lipopolysaccharide-inducible tumor necrosis factor production in vitro by peripheral blood monocytes of patients with viral hepatitis. We investigated lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor production in vitro by peripheral blood monocytes from patients with various liver diseases. Tumor necrosis factor production was found to be significantly reduced in patients with chronic hepatitis B (n = 17; 135 +/- 30 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml; mean +/- S.E.M.) and patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (n = 15; 212 +/- 22 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) compared with healthy control individuals (n = 47; 411 +/- 40 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml; p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.01, respectively). This reduced tumor necrosis factor production was not only seen with an optimal stimulating concentration of lipopolysaccharide (100 ng/ml) but also with suboptimal concentrations (0.1 ng/ml). In contrast to patients with chronic viral hepatitis, monocytes from patients with alcohol-induced cirrhosis (n = 26; 444 +/- 49 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 7; 412 +/- 81 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) and alcohol-induced fatty liver changes (n = 5; 401 +/- 62 pg tumor necrosis factor/ml) produced normal amounts of tumor necrosis factor when stimulated with an optimal concentration of lipopolysaccharide. Lipopolysaccharide (0.1 ng lipopolysaccharide/ml)-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes of patients with chronic hepatitis B (n = 15; 102 +/- 32 pg/ml) or non-A, non-B hepatitis (n = 13; 97+/- 16 pg/ml) could not be induced to produce more tumor necrosis factor either when prestimulated with gamma-interferon (170 +/- 45 pg/ml and 149 +/- 32 pg/ml, respectively), a lymphokine known to activate monocytes, or with the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin to reduce the suppressive effect of prostaglandin E2 (148 +/- 40 pg/ml and 153 +/- 45 pg/ml, respectively. 
The burden of acute respiratory infection due to measles in developing countries and the potential impact of measles vaccine. Measles is a major cause of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in developing countries. Hospital and community-based studies of ALRI have found that measles accounts for 6%-21% of the morbidity and 8%-93% of the mortality due to ALRI. Although live attenuated measles vaccine is one of the most effective vaccines in use today, measles has not been controlled in many parts of the world, primarily because the levels of vaccine coverage required to interrupt measles transmission have not been achieved. In addition, in some areas, a large percentage of cases of measles occur in infants who are younger than the age recommended for vaccination. Recent studies suggest that the Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine may be more immunogenic than other vaccine strains in young infants. A substantial proportion of ALRI could be prevented by increasing measles vaccine coverage and by the use of particular vaccine strains in younger children. 
Adrenal and ovarian steroid hormone responses to gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment in polycystic ovary syndrome. It has been postulated that in polycystic ovary syndrome ovarian steroids can influence adrenal steroidogenesis. To test this hypothesis, basal and dexamethasone-suppressed-corticotropin-stimulated steroid hormone responses were compared among three groups of women before, during, and after gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment for 3 months. The groups were characterized as follows: (1) women with polycystic ovary syndrome with high dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (greater than 400 micrograms/dl), (2) women with polycystic ovary syndrome with normal dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (less than 300 micrograms/dl), and (3) normal ovulatory women. In response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, basal serum luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, estradiol, estrone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone in all three groups were suppressed to similar levels. Basal serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in the group with high levels declined, but they did not reach the normal, unaltered concentrations in the other two groups. Two subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome in this group with high levels, who showed the greatest declines in basal serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels (34%, 40%), also had evidence of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency before treatment, which was resolved by the end of treatment. In both groups with polycystic ovary syndrome, the increase in maximum incremental rise of dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels in response to a pharmacologic dose of corticotropin from a dexamethasone-suppressed baseline (adrenal androgen capacity) remained unaltered during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist administration. We conclude that ovarian steroids may promote excessive adrenal androgen secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, may induce 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deficiency as a mechanism for adrenal involvement in some women with polycystic ovary syndrome, and do not influence adrenal androgen capacity. 
Responsiveness of patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma to tamoxifen. A Gynecologic Oncology Group study of second-line therapy in 105 patients. One hundred five patients with Stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer whose disease had persisted or recurred after primary surgery and first-line chemotherapy were given tamoxifen (20 mg orally twice daily) and evaluated for response. Eighteen percent of the patients responded: 10% demonstrated a complete response (CR) and 8% showed a partial response (PR). Thirty-eight percent of the patients had short-term disease stabilization. CR had a median duration of 7.5 months, with the longest lasting 17 months. For patients with PR or stable disease, the median duration of response was 3 months (maximum duration, 9 months). When estrogen receptors of tumor tissue from patients demonstrating CR were evaluated, eight of nine (89%) had elevated estrogen receptor levels. This contrasts with patients who had stable or progressive disease as only 59% of them had measurable estrogen receptors (P = 0.16). 
Mucosal IgA recognition of Helicobacter pylori 120 kDa protein, peptic ulceration, and gastric pathology. The gastric IgA response to Helicobacter pylori was examined in 100 dyspeptic patients by means of immunoblotting of supernatants from antral biopsy and gastric mononuclear cell cultures. 76 of 78 patients with chronic gastritis, 2 of 8 with reactive gastritis, and 1 of 14 subjects with normal mucosa showed positive responses. Of patients with chronic gastritis, 75%, 83%, 97% and 76%, respectively, showed responses to the 120 kDa, 90 kDa, 61 kDa, and 31 kDa proteins. None of the 19 patients with chronic gastritis who did not recognise the 120 kDa protein had peptic ulcers, whereas 25 of 57 with positive recognition had peptic ulcers (p less than 0.001). Mucosal recognition of the H pylori 120 kDa protein was also positively associated with the activity of gastritis (polymorph infiltration) (p less than 0.002) and with the extent of surface degeneration (p less than 0.01). These findings suggest that 120-kDa-positive strains of H pylori have pathogenic features associated with active gastritis and peptic ulceration. Infection with 120-kDa-negative strains may explain why peptic ulceration develops in only a proportion of subjects infected with H pylori. 
Meniscal tears: MR and arthrographic findings after arthroscopic repair. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed on 29 previously repaired menisci and one conservatively treated meniscus (total, 30 menisci). Intermediate- and T1-weighted MR sequences revealed persistent signal intensity extending to an articular surface (grade 3 signal intensity) in 27 of the 30 menisci. On T2-weighted images, seven of the 30 menisci were found to contain unequivocally higher signal intensity, defined by a full-thickness defect (grade 3 signal intensity involving two articular surfaces) increasing in signal intensity to a level equivalent to that of joint fluid. The MR imaging and arthrographic appearances of 23 of the 30 menisci were compared. Arthrographic examination revealed partial or complete healing in 13 menisci and tears in 10. The presence of grade 3 signal intensity on intermediate- and T1-weighted MR images did not reliably predict a tear seen at arthrography. Unequivocally higher signal intensity on T2-weighted images is a useful sign in the prediction of a persistent meniscal tear (sensitivity, 60%; specificity, 92%; P less than .02). Since presence of grade 3 signal intensity on intermediate- and T1-weighted images does not reliably predict a tear and unequivocal T2 increase in intensity has a sensitivity of only 60%, arthrography should be considered for assessment of the symptomatic, previously repaired meniscus. 
Reduced vascular compliance as a marker for essential hypertension. In 38 patients with established essential hypertension and 32 age-matched normotensive control subjects proximal and distal arterial compliance were determined by computer-based assessment of the diastolic decay of a brachial arterial tracing and a modified Windkessel model of the circulation. In the hypertensive subjects compared to the normotensive subjects mean arterial pressure was 25% higher (P less than .001), systemic vascular resistance 23% higher (P less than .01), proximal compliance 19% lower (P less than .01), and distal compliance 72% lower (P less than .001). The reduction in distal compliance was highly age-dependent. In the youngest age range (45 to 54 years) little overlap appeared between hypertensive and normotensive groups, whereas in the oldest subjects studied (65 to 75 years) distal compliance was comparably low in the two groups. Thus, distal vascular compliance provides a sensitive and specific marker for the abnormal vasculature associated with hypertension and may be particularly useful in identifying the disease in young individuals with borderline blood pressure. 
Intestinal injury after lumbar discectomy. In a review of 5,200 lumbar discectomies performed from 1974 to 1989, two patients sustained a ventral perforation of the disc space followed by isolated small intestinal injury. Both patients underwent lumbar discectomy at the lumbosacral junction and presented with signs and symptoms of acute abdominal distress within three days after the operation. At surgical laparotomy, small tears were noted in the ileum, which were closed primarily. The patients had an uneventful recovery. The results of a review of 11 instances reported in the literature suggest that isolated intestinal injuries usually occur postoperatively at the lumbosacral junction and involve the small intestine. Factors, such as body habitus, surgical experience, patient positioning and types of instruments, as well as the use of a surgical microscope, do not appear to modify the risk of intestinal injury. After discectomy, patients may present with acute abdominal signs and symptoms or chronic wound infections. Work-up studies include evaluation of vascular structures and ureters either roentgenographically or at abdominal exploration. A high index of suspicion and adequate disc space visualization during discectomy may reduce the incidence of this complication. 
Primary CNS lymphoma treated with osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption: prolonged survival and preservation of cognitive function. Combination chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy has had only modest efficacy in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma. Median survival of these patients, treated primarily with radiotherapy, is 13 months; 5-year survival is less than 5%. Thirty consecutive non-acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients with primary CNS lymphoma were treated with barrier-dependent chemotherapy using intraarterial mannitol to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Follow-up included extensive neuropsychologic testing of all patients. Thirteen patients received cranial radiation 1 to 9 months before referral (group 1). Seventeen patients received initial BBB disruption chemotherapy with subsequent radiation only for tumor progression or recurrence (group 2). The difference in median survivals from diagnosis--17.8 months for group 1 and 44.5 months for group 2--was statistically significant (P = .039). Group 1 survival is comparable with the 20-month median survival of a historical series of patients (n = 208) treated with radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy. Group 2 patient survival represents an advance in the survival of CNS lymphoma and was associated with preservation of cognitive function in six of seven nonirradiated complete responders observed for 1 to 7 years. Patient toxicity was manageable in this intensive therapeutic regimen. In this series, a plateau in survival curves suggests that a major portion of these patients may be cured without the neuropsychologic sequelae associated with cranial radiation. 
Modulation of neuropathic pain behavior in rats by spinal disinhibition and NMDA receptor blockade of injury discharge. When a peripheral nerve is severed, damaged sensory fibers emit a barrage of impulses that lasts for many seconds, or even several minutes ('injury discharge'). We have shown in rats that local anesthetic blockade of this discharge suppresses autotomy (a behavioral model of neuropathic pain). Correspondingly, mimicking prolonged injury discharge with electrical stimulation, especially of C-fibers, increased autotomy. These data support the hypothesis that injury discharge plays a role in the triggering of neuropathic pain. The mechanism of triggering autotomy was investigated using intrathecal injection of agents affecting glutamatergic transmission. A single intrathecal injection at the lumbar enlargement of the NMDA receptor blockers MK-801 and 5-APV, just prior to neurectomy, significantly suppressed autotomy. Blocking glycinergic inhibition just prior to neurectomy with a single strychnine injection strikingly enhanced autotomy. Strychnine enhancement of autotomy was prevented by prior injection of MK-801 or 5-APV. These results suggest that the expression of autotomy in rats, and by inference neuropathic pain in humans, is affected by injury discharge, possibly mediated by long-lasting, NMDA receptor-related, spinal disinhibition. 
Plasmapheresis. A therapeutic option in the management of heparin-associated thrombocytopenia with thrombosis. Heparin-associated thrombocytopenia with thrombosis (HATT) is an uncommon syndrome that is estimated to occur in 1-5% of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Early diagnosis requires careful clinical surveillance, and the management of these patients can be complex. Cessation of heparin therapy and substitution or addition of oral anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents, dextrans, and prostacyclin analogues have been advocated. The authors are aware of only two case reports in the literature that examine the use of plasmapheresis as a therapeutic alternative. The authors report a case of a 53-year-old white man who developed HATT after a single protamine-reversed exposure to heparin. Controlled platelet aggregation studies performed before and after apheresis sessions documented a dramatic response and rapid normalization of platelet number and function in the patient. The authors conclude that plasmapheresis could be a valuable adjunct in the successful management of patients with HATT. When done in conjunction with platelet aggregation studies, an objective measurement of therapeutic efficacy can be achieved. 
Interleukin-2 induces early multisystem organ edema mediated by neutrophils. Interleukin-2 (IL-2), an agent known to activate neutrophils (PMN) with thromboxane (Tx)B2 release, produces pulmonary edema within 6 hours of intravenous infusion. This study tests the role of PMN in mediating the edema. Anesthetized rats received 10(6)U recombinant human IL-2 (n = 15) or vehicle (n = 14) as a constant intravenous infusion during a period of 1 hour. At this time there was leukopenia 3.63 +/- 0.43 (x10(3)/mm3) relative to vehicle-infused control rats 6.12 +/- 0.86 and a decline in PMN, 2.19 +/- 0.14 relative to control value of 3.33 +/- 0.05 (both p less than 0.05). After 6 hours edema, as measured by increase in the wet to dry weight (W/d) ratio, was present in the lungs (4.93 +/- 0.20 relative to control 4.06 +/- 0.10), heart (4.09 +/- 0.11 versus 3.76 +/- 0.08), liver (3.50 +/- 0.10 versus 3.18 +/- 0.10), and kidney (4.25 +/- 0.07 versus 4.00 +/- 0.07) (all p less than 0.05). There was increased lung permeability demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration of 1970 +/- 210 micrograms/mL relative to control 460 +/- 90 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). Interleukin-2 resulted in lung PMN sequestration of 53 +/- 7 PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) relative to 23 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in controls (p less than 0.05) and increased plasma TxB2 levels to 1290 +/- 245 pg/mL relative to control 481 +/- 93 pg/mL (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment of other rats (n = 8) with selective anti-rat neutrophil antiserum 18 hours before the experiment led to a peripheral PMN count 10% of baseline and prevented edema in the lungs (W/d ratio 4.20 +/- 0.16) and heart (3.67 +/- 0.07) (both p less than 0.05) but not liver or kidney. Protein in lung lavage was reduced to 760 +/- 220 micrograms/mL (p less than 0.05). The protection afforded by leukopenia was associated with lack of PMN sequestration and prevention of the increase in plasma Tx levels (484 +/- 120 pg/mL, p less than 0.05). These data indicate that the rapid induction of lung and heart edema with a 1-hour infusion of IL-2 in the rat is mediated, in large part, by activated PMNs. 
Effect of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition on the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. To determine whether angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition may reduce the incidence of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), we retrospectively identified 322 consecutive patients who underwent a successful procedure from June 1988 to December 1989. No patients developed chest pain, ST segment elevation, positive cardiac enzymes, or other evidence of abrupt vessel closure following the PTCA. All patients received intravenous heparin after PTCA and aspirin was begun on the day prior to PTCA. Patients were separated into two groups: those at hospital discharge incidentally treated for hypertension or heart failure with ACE inhibitors (n = 36), and those treated with a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors (n = 286). The two groups were similar with respect to age (61 +/- 13.5 vs. 60 +/- 12.5, p = NS) and other demographic characteristics. Restenosis, defined as the presentation to a physician with symptoms of angina within 6 months of the PTCA and the finding on repeat catheterization of a significant restenosis at the site of the PTCA, occurred in 30% of the patients who were discharged on a drug regimen which did not include ACE inhibitors vs. 3% (p less than .05) in those treated with an ACE inhibitor. Thus, it appears that the use of ACE inhibitors may significantly reduce the incidence of restenosis after successful PTCA. 
Nutritional support in the critically ill surgical patient. Aggressive nutritional support in the critically ill surgical patient is essential if improved outcome is to be realized. An understanding of the metabolic alterations of trauma and sepsis provides the foundation for a nutritional prescription for the individual patient. Careful nutritional assessment; titration of fluid, electrolytes, and micronutrients; provision of adequate calories and nitrogen to meet metabolic needs; and the selective use of specialized formulations are important components of nutritional management in the ICU. 
Patellofemoral pain. An arthroscopic perspective. Patellofemoral pain should be approached as thoroughly as any other musculoskeletal disease. A careful patient history and physical examination are mandatory. These are followed by appropriate imaging studies such as radiographs, bone scans, CT scans, CT arthrograms, and MRI, as each individual case demands. Finally, arthroscopy is employed in its proper sequence. This article has been developed as an attempt to define a classification scheme of anterior knee pain and then to narrow this down to pain localized to the patellofemoral joint. The authors have attempted to isolate further the clinical entities to those that can be diagnosed and treated arthroscopically. Arthroscopy and arthroscopic surgery allow recognition and treatment of these disorders with minimal invasiveness and patient morbidity. 
The elusive cause of instability in unstable angina. The causes of unstable angina are still largely unknown. However, some facts deriving from angiographic, postmortem, and pathophysiologic studies are well established. Angiographic findings: coronary thrombi and complicated stenoses are more frequent in unstable than in stable angina. Conversely, the severity of coronary atherosclerosis and the development of collateral circulation is similar in both coronary syndromes. Postmortem findings: the following features are more frequent in unstable than in stable angina: (1) mural thrombi, which often represent out-growth from the inside of a fissured plaque; (2) inflammatory cells at the site of plaques and in perivascular nerves; and (3) contraction bands in smooth muscle cells of the media surrounding plaques. However, fissured plaques can be found in 10% of individuals dying of noncardiac causes, and fissured plaque may occasionally be missing under the coronary thrombus in unstable angina. Pathophysiologic findings: patients with unstable angina compared with those with stable angina exhibit: (1) higher levels of serotonin in the coronary sinus; (2) higher systemic levels of fibrino-peptide A; (3) higher urinary levels of thromboxane A2 metabolites; and (4) a greater coronary reactivity to constrictor stimuli. A critical analysis of these established facts is required to set the stage for a better comprehension of the causes which can cause a coronary segment to progress in a stuttering way toward acute persistent coronary occlusion and myocardial infarction. Plaque fissure is likely to be an important background thrombogenic stimulus in many cases. 
Antitumor effect of synthetic derivatives of lipid A in an experimental model of colon cancer in the rat. Colon carcinoma is one of the most frequent causes of cancer death in industrialized countries. The patients generally die of the metastases. In a colon cancer rat model, the authors have shown that lipopolysaccharides from Escherichia coli induced the regression of carcinomatosis and cured 20%-30% of the rats. Some synthetic derivatives of lipid A, which are less toxic than lipopolysaccharides, were injected 14 days after the tumor cells. They induced the complete regression of peritoneal carcinomatosis consisting of numerous nodules measuring 1-5 mm in 20%-30% of rats. Only compounds with three or more hydroxymyristic acid residues were effective. In vivo effects were correlated with the capacity to induce the production of interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor but not with the capacity to induce macrophage-mediated cytolysis. It is therefore possible to synthesize weakly toxic derivatives of lipopolysaccharides retaining their antitumoral property in vivo. 
Diurnal variation of essential and physiological tremor. Evaluations were made of the diurnal variations of tremor power at rest, after fatigue and after mass loading, and plasma norepinephrine in patients with familial essential tremor and normal subjects. Diurnal tremor power rhythms for both essential and physiological tremor pursued identical temporal profiles. Plasma norepinephrine levels followed a congruent diurnal pattern with later peak values than the peak values of tremor power. Sympathetic nervous system activity is unlikely to be the cause of diurnal tremor power variation. The consistent diurnal rhythm of tremor power may affect dosage schemes of tremorolytic drugs. 
Measurement of in vivo urological tumour cell kinetics using multiparameter flow cytometry. Preliminary study. The in vivo labelling of urological tumour cells using the S phase marker bromodeoxyuridine (BRdU) for histochemical studies is reported. The use of multiparameter flow cytometry (FCM) with BRdU labelling to study tumour proliferation offers significant advantages. It provides simultaneous measurements of the DNA ploidy (DI), the duration of the S phase (Ts), the potential doubling time (Tpot) and the total and aneuploid tumour labelling indices (LI) from a single specimen. Heterogenous tumour cell populations can be measured with high sensitivity. We report a preliminary study to evaluate the method in the measurement of the kinetics of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder (TCCB). Nineteen patients with TCCB, 1 with leukoplakia of the bladder, 2 with renal carcinoma, 1 with prostatic carcinoma and 1 with a squamous carcinoma of the penis were studied. Of the bladder tumours, 3 were aneuploid, DI = 1.32, 1.58 and 1.89. BRdU uptake was detected in all tumours. The median LI was 1.5% (range 0.5-10.0). In 15/19 tumours the labelling profile was satisfactory for calculation of the Ts and Tpot. The median Ts was 6.2 h and the median Tpot was 17.1 days. This study demonstrates that measurement of multiple parameters of urological tumour proliferation in vivo is possible. These parameters require further assessment as indices of biological aggressiveness and clinical prognosis. 
Effects of heart rate and pulmonary artery pressure on Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time in experimental acute pulmonary hypertension. Chronic pulmonary hypertension in humans is characterized by shortening of the pulmonary artery acceleration time as measured by Doppler echocardiography, such that the higher the pulmonary artery pressure, the shorter the pulmonary acceleration time. Increases in heart rate are also known to produce decreases in the pulmonary artery acceleration time. To explore the relationship between mean pulmonary artery pressure, heart rate, and Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time, experimental acute pulmonary hypertension was created in nine Duroc swine, either by infusion of Sephadex beads with embolization of the pulmonary arterial circulation or by partially occluding the main pulmonary artery 8 to 10 cm distal to the pulmonic valve. Pulmonary artery Doppler flow velocity recordings and invasive pressure measurements were made at baseline and at paced atrial rates ranging from 60 to 160 beats per minute, in 20-beat increments. The results in this acute animal model reveal that increases in heart rate produced significant decreases in Doppler pulmonary artery acceleration time at mean pressures below 25 mm Hg. However, with mean pulmonary artery pressures greater than 25 mm Hg, both heart rate and increases in pulmonary artery pressure had no significant effect on acceleration time. 
Recent developments in the diagnosis and management of patients with transient ischaemic attacks and minor ischaemic strokes. Appropriate management of the patient with transient focal neurological symptoms must start with accurate clinical diagnosis. Wider use of clear diagnostic criteria and symptom checklists, and better knowledge of the clinical features of the 'funny turns' which are not related to transient focal cerebral ischaemia could reduce the present variability in clinical diagnosis of transient ischaemic attacks. More accurate clinical diagnosis contributes to better selection of the most appropriate investigation strategy for each patient. A basic minimum standard of investigation is outlined and perhaps provides a suitable template for audit. Patients with transient ischaemic attacks which are definitely in the carotid distribution may be eligible for entry in trials of carotid endarterectomy. Prudent use of duplex ultrasound studies of the carotid arteries in patients with appropriate symptoms is an effective way to reduce the costs of investigations and their complications (i.e. the number of strokes associated with cerebral angiography). Digital venous subtraction angiography has, by comparison, many disadvantages as a screening tool. Advances in management include: recent statistical overviews which have emphasized the need to consider blood pressure and plasma cholesterol reduction in a large proportion of patients, and the value of long term anti-platelet therapy in reducing the risks of stroke, myocardial infarction and vascular death in both males and females. The value of anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation and transient ischaemic attacks or minor stroke is being tested in current trials. 
Total knee arthroplasty at a Veterans Administration Medical Center. Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) was evaluated in 256 consecutive knees in a Veterans Administration hospital. Patient satisfaction and the effect of intercurrent illness were studied in addition to standard clinical and roentgenographic parameters. Evaluation of results show the superiority of condylar knee designs. In general, TKA was successful with a high degree of patient satisfaction. 
Molecular mechanisms of tubulointerstitial hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Adult kidneys, which are principally composed of tubulointerstitium, do not normally regenerate or expand their working pool of functional cells at a very high rate. Loss of kidney tissue, however, can lead to some compensatory renal enlargement. The catalytic forces initiating such exchanges have not been fully articulated by current experimental endeavors. Increasing evidence, nevertheless, does suggest that factors other than simple changes in renal hemodynamics may be involved in this process. Different cellular elements in the tubulointerstitial microenvironment probably modulate changes in tubular enlargement or size through a complex cytokine network. Autocrine and paracrine stimulation of enlargement by different local growth factors also seem to play a pivotal role. After binding to cellular receptors, these factors activate signal transduction pathways resulting in expression of immediate early genes, which by themselves can synchronize the expression of subsequent genes through the medium of transacting factors. The renal enlargement response can also be modified by endocrine hormones that can activate such genes directly and/or stimulate other adjunctive processes, like receptor expression for the regional binding of growth factors. Furthermore, renal enlargement is under negative feedback of inhibitory factors like TGF beta. It is possible, for example, that special genes exist which are only expressed to arrest enlargement. It has been further suggested that activation of the Na+/H+ antiporter is a common denominator in renal enlargement. Recent findings, however, indicate that the activation of this antiporter is not always necessary, and might rather be a parallel event rather than a key phenomena in tubular enlargement. G0/G1 transition of tubular cells seems to involve similar factors in tubular hypertrophy and hyperplasia. The factors which are responsible for the final determination of the enlargement pattern (hypertrophy vs. proliferation) are unknown. The separation between hypertrophy and hyperplasia, although suggested by striking differences in cellular regulation, may be somewhat artificial, since responses leading to tubular enlargement also exist in circumstances where hyperplasia and hypertrophy are combined events. Recently it has been proposed that growth factors stimulate gluconeogenesis in proximal tubular cells producing hyperplasia, whereas factors inhibiting gluconeogenesis might induce hypertrophy. Whether the common pathway message of this intriguing hypothesis is correct still requires further validation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The feeding pharyngostomy: an alternative approach to enteral feeding. We present a six-year retrospective review of feeding pharyngostomies as performed in this department. The indications, technique and complications of this procedure are discussed. 
Arteriographic findings in EDTA chelation therapy on peripheral arteriosclerosis. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled study, 153 patients with claudication were each given either 20 infusions of Na2EDTA or 20 infusions of saline. Walking distances and ankle/brachial indices were measured before, during, and after treatment. In 30 patients, angiograms and transcutaneous oxygen tensions were obtained before, during, and after treatment. The patients' subjective evaluations of the effect of treatment were also recorded. It is concluded that EDTA chelation therapy has no effect in patients with intermittent claudication in the legs caused by arteriosclerosis. 
Mechanisms of hypertension in diabetes. Hypertension in insulin resistance states is generally attributed to hyperinsulinemia, with resulting increases in renal sodium retention and/or sympathetic nervous system activity. However, recent data from our laboratory suggest that cellular insulin resistance, rather than hyperinsulinemia per se, may lead to hypertension. The basic tenet proposed in this review is that the common mechanism involved in the development of hypertension in both type I and type II diabetes mellitus is a deficiency of insulin at the cellular level. Recent observations suggest that impaired cellular response to insulin predisposes to increased vascular smooth muscle (VSM) tone (the hallmark of hypertension in the diabetic state). For example, recently reported studies from our laboratory demonstrate that insulin in physiological doses attenuates the vascular contractile response to phenylephrine, serotonin, and potassium chloride. Thus, insulin appears to normally modulate (attenuate) VSM contractile responses to vasoactive factors, and insulin resistance should accordingly be associated with enhanced vascular reactivity. Abnormal VSM cell calcium [Ca2+]i homeostasis may be the nexus between insulin resistance and increased VSM tone. The genetically obese, hyperinsulinemic, insulin-resistant Zucker rat demonstrates increased vascular reactivity, reduced membrane Ca2(+)-ATPase activity, increased cellular Ca2+ levels, and a marked impairment in vascular smooth muscle Ca2+ efflux compared to lean controls. Insulin stimulates membrane Ca-ATPase, blocks Ca2+ currents, and Ca2(+)-driven action potentials. Thus, an insulin-resistant state as exists in the Zucker rat may be associated with increased Ca2+ influx through voltage-dependent sarcolemmal Ca2+ channels and/or decreased production or activation of the VSM cell Ca-ATPase pump. 
Pyridostigmine used as a nerve agent pretreatment under wartime conditions. OBJECTIVE. To determine the adverse effects of pretreatment with pyridostigmine bromide for nerve agent exposure during wartime. DESIGN. A retrospective study. SETTING. Southwest Asia. PARTICIPANTS. Personnel who provided medical support to the XVIII Airborne Corps. These medical officers supplied information pertaining to symptoms and disposition of 41,650 soldiers who received pyridostigmine at the onset of hostilities of Operation Desert Storm. INTERVENTION. Pyridostigmine bromide, 30 mg orally, was self-administered every 8 hours while under the threat of nerve agent attack (for 1 to 7 days). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. Physiologic changes attributable to pyridostigmine that resulted in need for medical attention, discontinuation of the drug, hospitalization, and/or evacuation from Southwest Asia. RESULTS. About half of the population noted physiologic changes that were not incapacitating, such as increased flatus, abdominal cramps, soft stools, and urinary urgency. Approximately 1% of the soldiers believed they had effects that warranted medical attention, but fewer than 0.1% had effects sufficient to discontinue the drug. Nonincapacitating symptoms often occurred; however, military mission performance was not impaired. CONCLUSION. While under the threat of nerve agent attack, pyridostigmine can be administered to virtually all soldiers. 
Systemic effects of collagen-impregnated aortoiliac Dacron vascular prostheses on platelet activation and fibrin formation. To minimize intraoperative blood loss a watertight knitted Dacron aortoiliac prosthesis has been developed by impregnation with bovine collagen. A potential disadvantage is that collagen may be associated with an increase in thrombus formation. We conducted a prospective randomized trial to study the systemic effects of collagen-impregnated prostheses and of aortoiliac operation as such on the coagulation mechanism during the first 10 days after operation. Forty-one patients randomly received either a collagen-impregnated (n = 20) or a nonimpregnated prosthesis (n = 21). Twelve patients who underwent cholecystectomies served as controls. Three markers of the coagulation mechanism were monitored: beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products. We found no significant differences in median beta-thromboglobulin, fibrinopeptide A, and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product levels between patients in the collagen-impregnated prosthesis group and patients in the nonimpregnated prosthesis group. This indicates that collagen does not stimulate the coagulation cascade any more than conventional Dacron protheses do. In a comparison of patients who underwent aortoiliac reconstruction and patients who underwent cholecystectomies, the results indicated a significant increased platelet activation and fibrin metabolism in aortoiliac reconstruction group compared with the control group. Finally, we observed a significantly higher preoperative fibrin metabolism in patients with vascular disease than in control subjects. This difference is attributable to the high preoperative fibrin/fibrinogen degradation product values in patients with aortic aneurysms. 
Adenosine thallium 201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy. Pharmacologic coronary vasodilation as an adjunct to myocardial perfusion imaging has become increasingly important in the evaluation of patients with coronary artery disease, in view of the large number of patients who cannot perform an adequate exercise test or in whom contraindications render exercise inappropriate. Adenosine is a very potent coronary vasodilator and when combined with thallium 201 scintigraphy produces images of high quality, with the added advantages of a very short half-life (less than 10 seconds) and the ability to adjust the dose during the infusion, which may enhance safety and curtail the duration of side effects. The reported sensitivity and specificity of adenosine thallium 201 scintigraphy for the detection of coronary artery disease are high and at least comparable with imaging after exercise or dipyridamole administration. 
Inhibition of the metabolism of atrial natriuretic factor causes diuresis and natriuresis in chronic heart failure. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone secreted by the heart that is degraded in vivo by endopeptidase 24:11 (atriopeptidase). UK 69,578 is a novel atriopeptidase inhibitor that raises plasma levels of ANF in animals and normal volunteers, with associated diuresis and natriuresis. This study examines the effects of UK 69,578 in patients with mild heart failure. UK 69,578 was administered as an intravenous infusion over 20 min in a placebo-controlled, cross-over study to six patients with stable (NYHA Class 2) chronic heart failure. The atriopeptidase inhibitor was well tolerated and no side effects were encountered. Mean baseline plasma ANF was elevated at 88 pg/mL (normal less than 50), and increased 2- to 5-fold after UK 69,578 administration. Plasma ANF did not change significantly following placebo. There was a marked diuresis after UK 69,578 compared to placebo. Urinary sodium excretion doubled for 4 to 6 h, but there was no significant rise in potassium excretion. There was no increase in plasma active renin concentration during the study period. Noninvasive hemodynamic monitoring revealed no significant changes in heart rate, systemic arterial blood pressure, or echocardiographic left ventricular dimensions. However, invasive measurements using a Swan-Ganz catheter demonstrated falls in mean right atrial and pulmonary artery wedge pressures after UK 69,578. There was no change in cardiac output. Thus, inhibition of endopeptidase 24:11 by UK 69,578 results in significant elevation of plasma ANF, with associated diuresis, natriuresis and venodilatation. The compound was well tolerated in these patients with mild chronic heart failure. 
Follicular accentuation of leukocytoclastic vasculitis in an HIV-seropositive man. Report of a case and review of the literature. Palpable purpura in a follicular localization developed in association with acute epididymitis in a white man who was seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Biopsy specimens revealed a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with follicular accentuation. With antibiotic therapy the vasculitis resolved, but it recurred during repeated episodes of the epididymitis. Follicular accentuation of skin disease is often seen in HIV-seropositive patients. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with a follicular localization may be the presenting skin manifestation of HIV infection. 
Clinical survey of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in children in a district of Japan. Ischemic cerebrovascular disease in children is relatively rare. To clarify the clinical features of ischemic stroke occurring in infants and children, we evaluated 54 cases of cerebral infarction, excluding cases of moyamoya disease, in patients less than 16 years old at 24 clinics in the Tohoku (northeast) district of Japan. We observed two incidence peaks, one in little children and the other in junior high school students. Infection and minor head trauma were more frequently seen prior to ischemic strokes than was heart disease. The middle cerebral artery region, including the basal ganglia, was most commonly affected (49 patients, 91%) on computed tomograms. Angiography was performed in 48 patients (89%) and showed various types of occlusive lesions, mostly affecting the middle cerebral artery. Hemiparesis was the most common form of disability following ischemic strokes (48 patients, 89%). Surgical treatment was carried out in seven patients (13%). The clinical course of these cases showed that the recovery of children after a stroke tends to be better than that of adults, but that permanent disabilities, such as hemiparesis or mental retardation, occur commonly. Further investigation of juvenile cerebrovascular disease is important to prevent ischemic strokes in children. 
Sinus parasystole. Sinus parasystole is the expression of a protected nondominant sinus pacemaker, which is totally independent of the dominant rhythm. Two forms of sinus parasystole are described: (1) an active form, where both the dominant and the parasystolic pacemakers are located within the sinus node and (2) a passive form, where the basic rhythm is ectopic and the sinus pacemaker is protected as a result of complete retrograde SA block. Three cases of sinus parasystole are analyzed. In the active form of the arrhythmia the parasystolic sinus P waves are identical to those of the basic sinus rhythm. The diagnosis is suggested by variably coupled premature sinus P waves occurring with mathematically related intervals. This relationship between the parasystolic intervals can not be precise whenever complicating factors such as modulation occur. The recognition of active sinus parasystole is difficult, since the parasystolic P waves do not differ from basic P waves, so that the pattern resembles that of sinus arrhythmia or sinus extrasystoles. The passive form of sinus parasystole is more easily recognized due to the clear-cut difference between the dominant ectopic atrial waves and the "parasystolic" sinus P waves, which manifest with variable coupling intervals and reflect mathematically related intervals in between. 
Familial pulmonary hypertension in association with an abnormal hemoglobin. Insights into the pathogenesis of primary pulmonary hypertension. A kindred with a familial hemoglobinopathy and familial primary pulmonary hypertension with autosomal dominant transmission has been identified. Affected family members were obvious from their cyanosis due to a reduced affinity for oxygen by the hemoglobin variant. The mother and one child had clinical pulmonary hypertension, whereas two siblings had cyanosis and preclinical pulmonary vascular disease as evidenced by abnormal perfusion lung scans and elevated levels of fibrinopeptide A in the face of normal pulmonary hemodynamics. In one, pulmonary hypertension could be induced with exercise. The studies on this family support the hypothesis that primary pulmonary hypertension may be initiated by abnormalities of the pulmonary vascular bed that predispose to in situ thrombosis. The possible common genetic transmission of the two diseases offers the speculation that the gene that confers predisposition to pulmonary hypertension may be located near the gene responsible for beta globulin. 
Three-dimensional x-ray computed tomography of the temporal bone as an aid to surgical planning. Three-dimensional x-ray computed tomography (3DCT) has been useful in planning surgical procedures involving craniofacial reconstruction, the pelvis, hip, spine, knee and shoulder. The clinical use of 3DCT in temporal bone surgery has not been evaluated. We used 3DCT to assess temporal bone anatomy in 9 patients. These cases evaluated two encephaloceles, two postinflammatory dehiscences, two temporal bone fractures, one glomus jugulare tumor, one acoustic neuroma, and one meningioma. We found 3DCT useful in these temporal bone applications as a supplement to standard two-dimensional CT scanning (2DCT). While 3DCT provided a better preoperative understanding of the underlying anatomy, no treatment was modified solely on the basis of the information derived from the 3-D presentation of data. We conclude that, although 3DCT images have some qualitative advantages over 2DCT techniques, their value in further defining temporal bone morphology must be evaluated against the cost entailed by their use. 
Structural alterations of microvascular smooth muscle cells in reduced renal mass hypertension. Loss of microvessels (anatomic rarefaction) occurs in chronic reduced renal mass (RRM) hypertension and is mediated via structural degeneration of vascular smooth muscle (VSM) and endothelial cells. The purpose of the present study was to determine if structural changes occur in VSM cells of the microvessels that remain in the tissue of rats with chronic RRM hypertension. Samples of cremaster muscles were taken from normotensive control rats and rats with acute (3-7 days) and chronic (14-28 days) RRM hypertension (75% reduction in kidney mass with 4% NaCl loading). The samples were fixed in situ and processed for light and electron microscopy. Ultrastructural morphology of VSM cells in terminal arterioles of control animals was normal. Although VSM morphology in many microvessels of RRM hypertensive rats was also normal, some vessels exhibited structural changes that were not present in arterioles of the normotensive animals. The most striking change was the appearance of more extensive dense bodies anchoring the contractile filaments around the outer membrane of the cells. Extreme vasoconstriction was observed in some arterioles of RRM rats as long as 2 weeks after salt loading. Focal areas of VSM cell proliferation were evident. Many of the changes occurring in RRM were detected as early as 1 week after the onset of hypertension. These observations suggest that renal mass reduction-salt loading hypertension is associated with early structural and functional changes in the VSM cells. 
Increased platelet aggregate formation in patients with chronic airflow obstruction and hypoxaemia. Platelet aggregate formation in vivo was assessed by means of the platelet aggregate ratio and from platelet release products (beta thromboglobulin, platelet factor 4, thromboxane B2) in 23 patients with chronic airflow obstruction with and without hypoxaemia and in 10 control subjects without respiratory disease. Eight of the 11 hypoxaemic patients were having long term oxygen therapy. The platelet aggregate ratio was lower in the hypoxaemic patients (0.88 (SE 0.03] than in the non-hypoxaemic (0.97 (0.01] and control groups (1.00 (0.02], and there was a trend to lower aggregate ratios in the more hypoxaemic patients. Platelet release products in the peripheral venous blood were not increased in the patients or control subjects. Platelet behaviour is altered in chronic hypoxaemia and this enhanced platelet activity could contribute to the pulmonary vascular damage found in these patients through direct effects or mediator release. 
Noncardiac chest pain in patients with heart disease. This is a retrospective study of cardiac patients with noncardiac chest pain referred for evaluation of esophageal motility. Sixty-eight patients with heart disease were compared with 210 patients without heart disease according to findings from symptom questionnaires and a psychologic test (Brief Symptom Inventory). More than 70% of each group qualified for an anxiety or depressive diagnosis on the symptom questionnaire. These diagnoses were supported by significant elevations of scores on the anxiety and depression scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Male gender and a diagnosis of panic disorder occurred significantly more often in the patients with heart disease. "Stress" was cited as the cause of illness in about half the sample, but this led to less than satisfactory rates of psychiatric evaluation or pharmacotherapy. This is of particular concern for the cardiac patients because of the known adverse effect of anxiety and depression in those with heart disease. 
Sleep apnea in patients with acute myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE: To document sleep apnea in the acute phase of myocardial infarction. If apnea occurs in patients with myocardial infarction, hypoxemia induced by apnea might exaggerate insufficiency of oxygen supplied to the damaged myocardium. DESIGN: Prospective controlled study. SETTING: Critical care unit of a teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients, average age 64 yrs (range 49 to 91). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patient measurements were recorded on a polygraph using an apnea-monitor, pulse oximeter, pulmonary artery pressure monitor, and an ECG. All of the patients observed showed frequent apneic episodes. The apnea was especially frequent when the cardiac index was low. Capillary oxygen saturation of less than 90% (suggesting systemic hypoxia) was observed in 21 patients concomitantly with apnea. Occasionally, arrhythmias followed these episodes (premature supraventricular contractions [n = 10], premature ventricular contraction [n = 4], and ventricular tachycardia [n = 2]). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that sleep apnea is common in the setting of acute myocardial infarction. It may be a factor predisposing to, or even causing, sudden death in patients with acute phase of myocardial infarction. 
Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy: detection of abnormal gallbladder motor function in patients with chronic acalculous gallbladder disease. CCK cholescintigrams were performed in 374 patients with recurrent postprandial right upper quadrant pain, biliary colic, and a normal gallbladder sonogram and/or cholecystogram. The results of these examinations were correlated with the patients' final medical/surgical diagnoses. Twenty-seven patients recruited as control volunteers without objective clinical evidence of biliary disease also underwent CCK cholescintigraphy to determine if the degree of gallbladder contraction post-CCK differs in symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects. Decreased gallbladder motor function was identified (maximal gallbladder ejection fraction response to CCK less than 35%) in 94% of patients with histopathologically confirmed chronic acalculous cholecystitis or the cystic duct syndrome and in 88% of patients clinically believed to have chronic acalculous biliary disease. Decreased gallbladder motor function does not distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic gallbladder disease. 
Prevalence of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] excess in coronary artery disease. Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is composed of 1 low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle, to which 1 molecule of apolipoprotein (a) is covalently linked. Elevated levels of Lp(a) have been associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) and Lp(a) has been shown to be highly heritable. Our purpose was to determine the prevalence of familial Lp(a) excess in patients with CAD. We determined plasma levels of Lp(a) in 180 patients (150 men and 30 women) with angiographically documented CAD before age 60 years, and in 459 control subjects (276 men and 183 women) clinically free of cardiovascular disease. In addition, Lp(a) levels were determined in families of 102 of the CAD probands (87 men and 15 women). No gender differences in Lp(a) levels were observed between men and women (patients or control subjects). Patients with CAD had higher Lp(a) levels than did control subjects (19 +/- 21 vs 13 +/- 15 mg/dl, p less than 0.001). The prevalence of Lp(a) excess (defined as greater than 90th percentile of controls) was 17% in patients with CAD (p less than 0.05). Lp(a) levels were not correlated with cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or apolipoproteins A-I or B. There was a weak correlation between Lp(a) and triglycerides (r = 0.166, p less than 0.05) in patients and control subjects. Stepwise discriminant analysis revealed that Lp(a) was a risk factor for the presence of CAD in men, independent of smoking, hypertension, diabetes, LDL and HDL cholesterol, or apolipoprotein A-I and B levels. Family studies revealed that Lp(a) levels are strongly genetically determined. 
Rubella prevention. Recommendations of the Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP). These revised Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommendations for the prevention of rubella update the previous recommendations (MMWR 1984;33:301-10,315-8) to include implementation of a new two-dose schedule for measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine. Current information about vaccine effectiveness, duration of immunity, vaccination in pregnancy, and progress in controlling congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) is also included. 
Cost-effectiveness of hepatitis B screening in a mental health institution. In 1982, the Ohio Department of Health Screening established guidelines for hepatitis B screening and vaccination for intermediate mental health care facilities. The present study was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of these guidelines. Data from an intermediate mental health care institution in Champaign/Urbana, Illinois, were used. The analysis considered the direct costs and benefits accrued over a 3-year period and a range of transmission rates. At a 3-year transmission rate of 0.030, the screening and vaccination policy cost $7300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $345,800 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). At a more likely 3-year transmission rate of 0.271, the screening and vaccination policy cost $300 per case of hepatitis B avoided (or $12,100 per hepatitis B fatality avoided). Either way, the active prevention policy compares very well with the amounts of money spent by the US Government on other life-saving programs. A general cost-effectiveness model is given that can be adapted for institution-specific analyses at other mental health care facilities. 
Complete repair of atrioventricular septal defect. We report our experience with 103 consecutive children who underwent repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect between 1971 and 1990. Ninety-one patients were less than 18 months old (mean age, 6.2 months; mean weight, 5.8 kg) and were repaired using deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest. There were 15 perioperative deaths. Twelve patients were older (mean age, 40.2 months; mean weight, 18.9 kg) and were repaired using moderate hypothermia and cardiopulmonary bypass. There were two perioperative deaths. Repairs were performed with the single-patch technique. Four younger patients required repeat repair to control residual mitral regurgitation. Two of the older children required late reoperation to replace one or both atrioventricular valves. Three younger children underwent pulmonary artery banding initially; 1 died after complete repair. Three older children underwent initial pulmonary artery banding; 2 died at definitive repair, and the survivor required pulmonary artery reconstruction, which was repeated subsequently. Since 1977 our policy has been to perform primary definitive repair whenever possible. Two patients died late from unrelated causes. At the most recent follow-up the majority of patients had no or minimal symptoms. We continue to advocate primary definitive repair whenever possible using the single-patch technique in symptomatic patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect. 
Crohn's disease of the small bowel. Crohn's disease is a perplexing panintestinal disease whose etiology is unknown. Symptoms and complications vary greatly from patient to patient. Despite the fact that no cure exists, thoughtful, well-planned therapy and appropriate timely intervention, where needed, can result in maintenance of a high quality of life for affected patients. 
Ballistic trauma to the abdomen: shell fragments versus bullets. Two-hundred ninety-nine patients who sustained penetrating ballistic trauma to the abdomen were divided into two groups: Group A consisted of 133 patients with shell fragment injuries from mortar artillery and Group B of 166 patients with bullet injuries from rifles and automatic or semiautomatic weapons. Both groups were analyzed retrospectively in order to compare the extent of injury and outcome. In Group A, the findings at laparotomy were negative in 15 of 133 patients (10%) compared with 9 of 166 patients (5%) in Group B (p less than 0.05). The most commonly injured abdominal organs in Group A were the colon (42%), liver (22%), small bowel (20%), stomach (14%), diaphragm (11%), spleen (10%), major vessels (9%), and kidney (9%). The abdominal organs commonly injured in Group B were the colon (50%), small bowel (41%), liver (33%), major vessels (20%), diaphragm (17%), stomach (15%), spleen (15%), and kidney (15%). Associated extra-abdominal injuries were present in 26% of Group A patients and in 21% of Group B patients (p less than 0.05). Major postoperative complications occurred in 7.5% and 8.4% of the patients in Group A and Group B, respectively (p less than 0.05). Perioperative mortality was 2.3% in Group A versus 7.2% in Group B (p less than 0.01). Our data suggest that high energy bullets to the abdomen cause higher tissue penetration and a greater blast effect than shell fragments. 
Recurrent aphthous ulcers in association with HIV infection. Description of ulcer types and analysis of T-lymphocyte subsets. This study was conducted to characterize the recurrent aphthous ulcers (RAU) found in association with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, to examine evidence for increased severity of the ulcers with HIV disease, and to determine whether increased severity is associated with abnormalities of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets. Seventy-five HIV-seropositive patients with RAU were followed for up to 2 years, and lymphocyte subsets were analyzed in 42. Minor, herpetiform, and major ulcer types were seen, but unexpectedly, 66% of the patients had the usually uncommon herpetiform and major types. These types were temporally associated with symptomatic HIV disease. Patients with major RAU were significantly more immunosuppressed than those with minor or herpetiform RAU in that they had fewer CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes (p less than 0.05). The lesion of RAU is considered to represent a local breakdown in immunoregulation. The systemic immune imbalance seen with HIV disease may amplify the local defect and lead to more severe ulcers. 
Formation of neutralizing antibodies against natural interferon-beta, but not against recombinant interferon-gamma during adjuvant therapy for high-risk malignant melanoma patients. In an adjuvant clinical trial, 34 high-risk malignant melanoma patients were treated with natural interferon (IFN)-beta and recombinant IFN-gamma. Patients with tumor location on head, neck, and trunk received 3 million IU IFN-beta intravenously (IV) three times weekly for 24 weeks. Patients with tumor location on the extremities received subcutaneous (SC) injection of 2 million IU of IFN-beta distal the locoregional lymph nodes instead. All patients were given 50 micrograms IFN-gamma SC on 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks. Antibody formation was detected by coincubation of IFN and patients' serum and assessment of the inhibition of the cytopathic effect by a virus suspension. Soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique. No antibodies against IFN-gamma were observed. The overall incidence of antibody formation to IFN-beta was 55.8% (19/34). Ninety-two percent of the SC-treated patients (13/14) and 30% (six of 20) of the IV-treated patients developed antibodies. Soluble interleukin-2 receptors were found to be significantly lower in antibody-positive patients than in antibody-negative patients. The authors conclude that IFN-beta antibody formation is frequent and might influence IFN induced sIL-2R elevation in vivo. 
Repair of coarctation of the aorta in children: postoperative morphology. To determine the morphologic sequelae after surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta, the authors retrospectively reviewed angiograms and hemodynamic and clinical data on 215 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization after surgical repair of coarctation of the aorta during a 13-year period. Ninety-seven patients (45%) underwent coarctation resection with end-to-end anastomosis; 92 (43%), subclavian-flap angioplasties; and 26 (12%), synthetic-patch repairs. Sixty-four patients (30%) had an "aneurysm," defined as a measurement ratio of repair site to diaphragmatic aorta greater than 1.5. Transverse-arch or isthmic hypoplasia or recoarctation was detected in 86 patients (40%) and was most commonly associated with septal defects or obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Pullback systolic pressure gradients at catheterization were significantly higher (P = .0001) in the patients with transverse-arch hypoplasia and recoarctation than in those with ratios of transverse arch to diaphragmatic aorta greater than 0.9. Significant postoperative arch obstructions can be predicted with measurement ratios on the basis of the diameter of the abdominal aorta. 
Can transcutaneous recordings detect gastric electrical abnormalities? The ability of transcutaneous recordings of gastric electrical activity to detect gastric electrical abnormalities was determined by simultaneous measurements of gastric electrical activity with surgically implanted serosal electrodes and cutaneous electrodes in six patients undergoing abdominal operations. Transient abnormalities in gastric electrical activity were seen in five of the six patients during the postoperative period. Recognition of normal gastric electrical activity by visual analysis was possible 67% of the time and with computer analysis 95% of the time. Ninety four per cent of abnormalities in frequency were detected by visual analysis and 93.7% by computer analysis. Abnormalities involving a loss of coupling, however, were not recognised by transcutaneous recordings. Transcutaneous recordings of gastric electrical activity assessed by computer analysis can usually recognise normal gastric electrical activity and tachygastria. Current techniques, however, are unable to detect abnormalities in electrical coupling. 
Cocultures: a new lead in embryo quality improvement for assisted reproduction. One of the contributory causes to poor PRs in assisted reproduction has been the decreased viability of transferred embryos and the transfer of four-cell embryos into an environment that naturally would be receptive only to 5-day-old blastocysts. In this paper, we have reviewed our own work and that of others on the role of tubal ampullary cells (cocultures) to mimic the in vivo environment to bring about improved embryo quality and an increased number of blastocysts for replacement in IVF patients. The establishment, maintenance, and behavior of human tubal cell lines is first presented, followed by their use as cocultures for fertilization and cleavage of embryos. The mode of action, specificity, and cryopreservation of ampullary cells are also discussed. The currently available results of pregnancies after cocultures are presented together with future aspects of research that are necessary to refine the coculture system. The ultimate aim is to mimic in vivo conditions in vitro, so that at least the PRs of assisted conception can be parallel to normal fecundity in the human. Therefore, a very attractive future includes the freezing of blastocysts generated from coculture, thawing, and replacing them in natural cycles. 
Mathematical modeling of antigen and immune complex kinetics during extracorporeal removal of autoantibody. The extracorporeal removal of circulating auto-antibodies by repeated plasma exchange or continuous lymph drainage is modeled by single-pool kinetics. Total amounts of antigenic determinants, k-valent antibodies and immune complexes are variables of the model. Factors influencing the course of therapy are included: production rate of antigen and antibody and their natural catabolism. This model can give useful formulae for clinical practice. The effect of treatment can be predicted from the relative depletion of antibody and the actual severity of the disease. Another formula shows how the changed catabolism of antigen after antibody binding can influence the amount of immune complexes. As an example, lymph drainage in myasthenia gravis is calculated using averaged data from three patients. 
Colonic fermentation of dietary fibre to short chain fatty acids in patients with adenomatous polyps and colonic cancer. Short chain (C2-C6) fatty acids are produced in the colon through bacterial fermentation of mainly dietary fibre. Butyrate (C4) possesses antineoplastic effects on human colon carcinoma cells, and epidemiological studies indicate that high fibre diets may reduce the incidence of colorectal cancer. The role of dietary fibre during colorectal carcinogenesis might therefore be related to its fermentation to butyrate. Faecal concentrations of total short chain fatty acids and concentrations and ratios of the individual C2-C6 fatty acids did not differ between 16 healthy controls, 17 patients with colonic adenomas, and 17 patients with colonic cancer. Comparison of the molar production velocities (mmol/l.hour) of total and individual short chain fatty acids from glucose, ispagula, wheat bran, and albumin in six and 24 hour faecal incubations showed no differences. The ratio of butyrate production to total short chain fatty acid production from fibre, however, was reduced in patients with colonic cancer and adenomas compared with healthy controls (ispagula, six hours: 6.4, 7.6, and 11.5% respectively, p = 0.005 and 24 hour: 9.1, 9.9, and 15.4%, p = 0.002; wheat bran, six hours: 9.9, 10.2, and 14.7% respectively, p = 0.06 and 24 hours: 15.1, 16.8, and 21.0%, p = 0.01). It may be that the low ratios of colonic butyrate formation combined with low fibre diets increase the risk of colonic neoplasia. 
The natural history of HELLP syndrome: patterns of disease progression and regression. Despite much recent interest in HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count), there is little published information about the natural history of this unique form of severe preeclampsia-eclampsia. The time course and pattern of laboratory abnormalities for 158 patients with HELLP syndrome managed in a single tertiary referral center between 1980 and 1989 were studied retrospectively. Despite considerable patient variation, most gravid women with HELLP syndrome had decreasing platelet counts until 24 to 48 hours after delivery. Conversely, lactate dehydrogenase concentrations usually peaked 24 to 48 hours post partum. In all patients who recovered, a platelet count greater than 1,000,000/mm3 was spontaneously achieved by the sixth postpartum day or within 72 hours of platelet nadir. An upward trend in platelet count and a downward trend in lactate dehydrogenase concentrations should be apparent in patients without complications by the fourth postpartum day. These data provide baseline information against which the course of individual patients can be compared and the infrequent, atypical case identified for interventive therapy. 
Splenosis: an unusual cause of intraabdominal hemorrhage. A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe abdominal pain. She developed hypovolemic shock from an intra-abdominal bleed. At laparotomy she was found to be bleeding from two areas of splenosis on the uterine ligament. The patient had sustained a ruptured spleen 22 years prior and had no symptomatology from her areas of splenosis. A short review of splenosis is presented. 
Immunohematologic characteristics of infection-associated cerebral infarction. We evaluated 50 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke to assess the prevalence of systemic infection preceding the neurological event. We analyzed the immunohematologic characteristics of patients with and without signs and/or symptoms of a preceding infectious process. Patients were examined less than or equal to 7 days after cerebral infarction and evaluated for fibrinogen, anticardiolipin antibodies, fibrin D-dimer (a fragment of cross-linked fibrin), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and protein S. Of the 50 patients, 17 had symptoms of infection beginning less than or equal to 1 month before the stroke (11 had upper respiratory tract infections, three urinary tract infections, two subacute bacterial endocarditis, and one pneumonia). Compared with patients without infection, patients with infection had significant increases in fibrin D-dimer concentration (5.3 +/- 1.1 versus 4.7 +/- 0.9 log-transformed ng/ml, p less than 0.05) and cardiolipin immunoreactivity, IgG isotype (1.8 +/- 1.3 versus 1.1 +/- 0.9 log-transformed phospholipid units, p less than 0.04), and, when studied less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke, increased fibrinogen levels (459 +/- 126 versus 360 +/- 94 mg/dl, p less than 0.05). In conclusion, infection-associated cerebral infarction is common and is associated with substantial immunohematologic abnormalities. 
Postphlebitic syndrome and general surgery: an epidemiologic investigation. Of a random sample comprising 4581 subjects from The Copenhagen County, 3608 (79%) attended an interview and a general health examination. The subjects were defined as suffering from subjective postphlebitic syndrome if they claimed of lower extremity pain or cramps at rest and from objective postphlebitic syndrome if varicose veins, edema, lower extremity ulcers, or skin changes were present. By means of logistic regression analysis, subjective postphlebitic syndrome was found independently associated with previous thromboembolism, obesity, increasing age, female sex, hormonal therapy, varicose veins, and previous major abdominal surgery. Objective postphlebitic syndrome was associated with previous thromboembolism, obesity, former birthgiving, and high social status. The findings support the view that subclinical deep venous thrombosis in connection with previous surgery may give rise to symptoms in the lower extremities. 
Acute antihypertensive and renal effects of isradipine in hypertensive patients with normal and reduced renal function. The renal effects of a single oral dose of placebo v a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, isradipine, were investigated in 12 patients with mild-to-moderate essential hypertension. Six patients (group A) had normal creatinine concentrations greater than 1.6 mg/dL. Patients maintained a constant daily intake of approximately 120 mmol of sodium and 50 mmol of potassium. Measurements were taken at 30, 60, and 90 min after drug administration. Results indicated that isradipine at a dose of 5 mg once daily produced significant antihypertensive and renal responses. In conclusion, there is therapeutic benefit with isradipine independent of the status of renal function. 
Pathophysiology of renovascular hypertension. Renovascular hypertension has its experimental counterpart in the two-kidney, one clip model (Goldblatt hypertension). From the study of this model, a general pathophysiological scheme has evolved suggesting that temporal stages in the development and maintenance of hypertension are regulated by complicated hormonal and neural interrelations. The central roles played by the renin-angiotensin system and the renal nerves is discussed as they relate to other hormones. In addition, the possible contribution of converting enzyme inhibitors to understanding the pathophysiology of this condition is discussed. 
Observation of the external aperture of the vestibular aqueduct using three-dimensional surface reconstruction imaging. Observation of the external aperture of the vestibular aqueduct was hitherto possible only in cadavers or dry temporal bones; however, by applying three-dimensional surface reconstruction imaging, it is now possible to observe solid-looking images of this structure in living humans. When the width of the external aperture of the vestibular aqueduct was measured in 58 people, it was found to be significantly narrower in the affected ears of patients with Meniere's disease than in normal ears. 
Bright pleural effusion and ascites on gradient-echo MR images: a potential source of confusion in vascular MR studies. Motion of fluids other than blood can cause flow-related signal enhancement on MR images, including MR angiograms. In order to study this problem, the appearance of ascites (20 patients) and pleural effusions (five patients) was assessed on MR images made during suspended respiration with flow-compensated gradient-echo sequences as well as T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Signal intensities of vessels, fluid collections, and muscle were measured and vessel/muscle and vessel/fluid contrast were calculated. Fluid motion was measured with a bolus tracking technique that tags a selected volume of fluid with an RF presaturation. Fluid collections had a bright signal in four of five patients with pleural effusion and in 15 of 20 patients with ascites. The average contrast ratio between bright components of the fluid collections and vessels was only 0.03 +/- 0.09. Bright fluid collections were seen on MR angiograms and could obscure blood vessels. Bolus tracking measurements of ascites revealed multidirectional flow, suggesting that its bright signal is related to motion that continues during suspended respiration. Fluid collections appeared dark on T1-weighted images in all patients, indicating that a short T1 relaxation time was not a cause of the high signal intensity. The results indicate that, despite breath-holding, ascites and pleural effusions can show bright signal intensity on gradient-echo images. Awareness of this phenomenon will avoid confusion between moving fluid collections and flowing blood and identify a source of image degradation on both gradient-echo and T2-weighted spin-echo MR acquisitions. 
Alpha 2-macroglobulin is not an acute-phase protein in the rat testis. Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that Sertoli cells actively synthesize and secrete a nonspecific protease inhibitor in vitro; N-terminal sequence analysis, subunit structural analysis, and other biological studies revealed that this protein is the homolog of serum alpha 2-macroglobulin. We have now quantified the relative distribution of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the reproductive compartments and their comparison with nonreproductive organs. In serum and all nonreproductive tissues examined, the concentration of alpha 2-macroglobulin progressively decreased with advancing age. However, in both the testis and epididymis, the levels of this protein increased with the age of the animals. Serum alpha 2-macroglobulin levels were consistently higher than those in any other tissues until 60 days when the concentrations of this protein were the highest in the epididymis. The distribution of alpha 2-macroglobulin in various nonreproductive tissues from female rats was similar to that observed for male rats in that its levels tended to decrease with age. However, uterine levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin increased progressively with advancing age, whereas ovarian levels of alpha 2-macroglobulin remained relatively stable with an increase in animal age. As serum alpha 2-macroglobulin is an acute-phase protein in the rat, the response of this protein in the testis to induced inflammation was examined. The concentration of alpha 2-macroglobulin in serum rose about 150-fold after injection of fermented yeast. By contrast, the levels of this protein in rete testis fluid, which is derived exclusively from seminiferous fluid, did not change in response to inflammation. These results suggest that there might be distinctive mechanisms that regulate this protein in the systemic circulation vs. the microenvironment behind the blood-testis barrier in the seminiferous epithelium. 
Pulmonary hypertension and polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase after esophageal cancer operations. To evaluate the role of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) elastase in pulmonary impairment occurring after operation for esophageal cancer, 10 patients were randomized preoperatively into two equal groups. One group received a placebo infusion and the other, an infusion of the PMN elastase inhibitor ulinastatin. In the placebo group, the mean plasma PMN elastase level increased from 154 +/- 23 micrograms/L preoperatively to 449 +/- 56 micrograms/L at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01), whereas the mean plasma fibronectin concentration decreased from 490 +/- 70 micrograms/mL preoperatively to 265 +/- 81 micrograms/L on postoperative day 2 (p less than 0.01). The mean pulmonary vascular resistance increased markedly from 151 +/- 24 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 preoperatively to 284 +/- 76 dynes.s.cm-5.m-2 at 6 hours postoperatively (p less than 0.01). In the group given ulinastatin, 150,000 units every 12 hours from the start of the operation, the mean PMN elastase value at 6 hours postoperatively was lower (275 +/- 66 micrograms/L; p less than 0.01) and the fibronectin level on postoperative days 1 and 2, higher (p less than 0.05). A lower pulmonary vascular resistance was noted into day 2 (p less than 0.05). Our results suggest that PMN elastase may participate in the development of postoperative pulmonary impairment. 
Echocardiographic demonstration of decreased left ventricular dimensions and vigorous myocardial contraction during syncope induced by head-up tilt. Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed during a head-up tilt test in 11 control subjects (group I) and 18 patients with recurrent unexplained syncope. In four patients (group II), the head-up tilt test was negative at baseline and after isoproterenol infusion. Syncope was induced during baseline head-up tilt in nine patients (group III) and after isoproterenol challenge in five (group IV). The echocardiographic variables assessed were left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic areas and percent fractional shortening. At the end of head-up tilt, end-systolic area decreased by 4.5 +/- 1.3 and 3.0 +/- 1.2 cm2 in groups III and IV, respectively, compared with 0.5 +/- 0.7 and 0.2 +/- 0.1 cm2 in groups I and II, respectively (p less than 0.04). Similarly, end-diastolic area decreased by 5.5 +/- 2.6 cm2 in group III compared with 2.7 +/- 1.9 and 1.75 +/- 0.4 cm2 in group I and II, respectively (p less than 0.04). Additionally, at the end of the baseline study, fractional shortening was significantly greater in group III and group IV (43 +/- 5%) than in groups I and II (p less than 0.01). In conclusion, syncope induced by head-up tilt is associated with vigorous myocardial contraction and a significant decrease in left ventricular end-systolic dimensions. This left ventricular hypercontractility may play an important role in the pathogenesis of syncope induced by head-up tilt. 
Hepatitis B and C viruses and their interaction in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma. Serum taken from patients in a case-control study in Athens, Greece, was used to examine the interactive roles of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the origin of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). An enzyme immunoassay for anti-HCV was used to test serum taken from 185 cases with HCC, 35 cases with metastatic liver cancer (MLC), and 432 hospital controls. Weakly positive anti-HCV results were more strongly related to MLC than to HCC, implying that these anti-HCV results are false positive. By contrast, strongly positive anti-HCV results were significantly related to HCC (relative risk [RR], 6.3), whereas no significant association was evident for MLC (RR, 0.6). The association of anti-HCV with HCC was substantially higher among subjects whose radioimmunoassay was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (RR, 20.0) than among those whose radioimmunoassay was negative for this marker (RR, 4.8). These findings indicate that HCV infection has an interactive role in the origin of HCC. 
Multiple myeloma: increased circulating lymphocytes carrying plasma cell-associated antigens as an indicator of poor survival. In multiple myeloma (MM) an increase in circulating lymphocytes expressing plasma cell-associated antigens (PCAA) has been described. Its prognostic significance was evaluated in this study. The immunologic phenotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes was analyzed with a panel of monoclonal antibodies specific for B, T, natural killer lymphocytes, and PCAA (CD38, PCA1) in 52 MM patients at diagnosis, remission, and during relapse, 18 monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and 25 normal controls. No significant phenotypic alteration was observed in MGUS. In MM, the number of B lymphocytes was in the normal range at diagnosis and during the subsequent phases. A CD4/CD8 ratio decrease, during relapse, was due to both a CD4+ reduction and to an expansion of a subset of CD8+ activated suppressor lymphocytes. CD38+ and PCA1+ lymphocytes at diagnosis were significantly higher than in MGUS, and a further increase was observed during relapse, suggesting a correlation between PCAA expression and disease activity. The prognostic significance of increased PCAA was confirmed by a survival analysis of 32 patients evaluated at diagnosis using a CD38 cutoff of 0.45 x 10(9)/L positive lymphocytes. Median survival for patients with high values was only 14 months, whereas it was not reached at 32 months by those with low values (P less than .0007). 
Giant cell arteritis presenting as limb claudication. Report and review of the literature. Upper limb claudication and pulselessness is an uncommon presentation of giant cell arteritis (GCA), often resulting in delayed diagnosis. We describe such a case diagnosed by angiography, in which a temporal artery biopsy showed classic GCA, despite the absence of local signs or symptoms. A review of 26 similar cases revealed that in 81% of patients where the only manifestation of GCA was upper limb findings, temporal artery biopsy yielded positive findings. Steroid therapy clinically improved 24/26 patients. These findings suggest that a consideration of temporal artery biopsy early in the investigation will hasten diagnosis and appropriate therapy. 
Lack of C-erbB-2 protein expression in pulmonary carcinoid tumours. To determine if amplification of the C-erb-B2 proto-oncogene could be correlated with prognosis in carcinoid tumours, 49 pulmonary carcinoid tumours (26 typical, 23 atypical) were examined using a polyclonal antibody to the C-terminal peptide of the C-erb-B2 protein sequence. No C-erb-B2 gene product could be shown: the demonstration of C-erb-B2 does not seem to help, therefore, in determining diagnosis or prognosis in pulmonary carcinoid tumours. 
CHARGE and Joubert syndromes: are they a single disorder? A patient with the CHARGE association (Coloboma of the eye, Heart defect, Atresia of the choana, Retarded growth and development, Genital hypoplasia, and Ear anomalies or deafness) had intermittent hyperpnea and cerebellar hypoplasia; therefore, he had both the CHARGE association and Joubert syndrome. The 2 syndromes have not been previously linked. We discuss their similarities and review the literature. 
Femoral-distal bypass with in situ greater saphenous vein. Long-term results using the Mills valvulotome. During a 7-year period, 440 consecutive in situ saphenous vein grafts originating in the groin were performed in 371 patients, exposing the entire vein for valvulotomy with a modified Mills valvulotome. critical ischemia was the indication for bypass in 68%, and the distal anastomosis was to an infrapopliteal artery in 46%. Thirty-day operative mortality was 2.0%. Postoperative surveillance identified 18 stenotic grafts (4.1%), which were revised while still patent (primary revised patency); 36 grafts (8.2%) underwent revision after graft occlusion (secondary patency). Five-year life-table analysis showed overall primary revised patency of 78%, secondary patency of 83%, limb salvage of 88%, and patient survival of 66%. Femoroperoneal and inframalleolar bypasses fared well. The presence of diabetes did not diminish late graft patency. In contrast to reversed vein grafts, long infrapopliteal in situ grafts had long-term secondary patency similar to shorter femoropopliteal bypass grafts (p greater than 0.05). These results, coupled with the versatility and simplicity of the technique as used in the present series, suggest that in situ vein grafting is the procedure of choice for long infrapopliteal bypass. 
Identifying risk factors in development of clinically significant post-shock-wave lithotripsy subcapsular hematomas. A retrospective study of 1,012 shock-wave lithotripsy treatments was performed to identify and analyze the risk factors for the development of six clinically significant post-extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) subcapsular hematomas. The patients studied had clinical signs and symptoms that on evaluation were confirmed as originating from a subcapsular hematoma. Common factors identified which we believe may put patients at increased risk for the development of subcapsular hematoma included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and obesity. 
Pain centers--organization and outcome. Pain treatment centers have evolved at a rapid rate, but they differ in their complexity and services provided. Patients, as well as primary care physicians, have difficulty in identifying the appropriate center for a specific problem. Guidelines for pain centers have recently been proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain, along with an attempt at their accreditation. Outcome studies from pain centers have proliferated, with a wide range of treatment programs being reported. Comprehensive multidisciplinary pain centers using the rehabilitation medicine approach are effective in decreasing disability and increasing the productivity of patients with chronic, disabling pain. 
A universal ossicular replacement prosthesis: clinical trials of 152 cases. An ossicular replacement prosthesis is described that advances implant design in several respects. The head is a flattened egg shape, which eliminates pressure points against the pars tensa and provided balance on the stapes. Dense hydroxylapatite ceramic provides maximal biocompatibility. The shaft, of either Teflon or Plastipore, is easily cut to size and is replaceable to minimize wastage. Interchangeable partial or total shaft variants are provided. Trials in more than 200 patients have produced optimal results. Among 152 mature patients in 85% of the good-risk cases, the air-bone gap closed to within 20 dB and in 65% to within 10 dB; in 69% of all cases the gap closed to within 20 dB. Extrusion rates were 5% in good-risk cases and 7% overall. Long-term extrusions have not occurred. Inasmuch as cartilage interpositioning is unnecessary, the prosthesis is rapidly prepared and implanted by an easily mastered technique. 
Exercise training after cardiac transplantation. During the last decade, cardiac transplantation has become the accepted form of treatment for selected patients with end-stage heart disease, which usually results from dilated cardiomyopathy or coronary artery disease. Although 5-yr survival is currently 85%, patients have complicated courses after surgery, with an ever present risk of infection and graft rejection. Because of physical inactivity and severe limitation of cardiac output preoperatively, these deconditioned patients are excellent candidates for medically supervised rehabilitative exercise training programs. Denervation of the myocardium, which occurs with cardiac transplantation, results in a loss of autonomic nervous system modulation of cardiac output, with reliance on circulating catecholamines and with a delayed heart rate and cardiac output response to the onset of exercise. Oxygen uptake kinetics are prolonged, and maximal oxygen uptake is reduced. Additional abnormalities in cardiac and pulmonary artery pressures and in ventilation during exercise have been described. The literature contains seven studies concerning the effects of exercise training in cardiac transplant recipients. Benefits resulting from training include increases in maximal oxygen uptake, peak exercise power output, anaerobic threshold, and lean body mass, reduced perceived exertion, heart rate, and blood pressure during submaximal exercise, and a lowered resting heart rate and blood pressure. There are no data to suggest that exercise training alters the incidence of infection or rejection or improves longevity or return to pre-illness lifestyle. 
The pseudotumor syndrome. Disorders of cerebrospinal fluid circulation causing intracranial hypertension without ventriculomegaly. We report a series of eight cases that show a close resemblance to, but are not identical with, pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) as normally defined. The majority of these cases are characterized by raised intracranial pressure without ventriculomegaly. They include two cases of cranial venous outflow obstruction in which clinical or radiologic abnormalities precluded the diagnosis of PTC proper (cases 1 and 2); one case of chronic meningitis in which an abnormal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) composition precluded the diagnosis of PTC (case 3); two cases without either papilledema or a measured increase of CSF pressure, which in other respects, particularly in response to treatment, resembled PTC (cases 4 and 5); and three cases of what is thought to represent an infantile form of PTC (cases 6 through 8). The purpose of the analysis of these cases is twofold. First, it is argued that these cases throw light on the mechanism of PTC itself, supporting a concept of a disturbance of CSF circulation in this condition, and that they are themselves illuminated by considerations of typical PTC. Second, the cases are used to frame a proposed classification of the pseudotumor syndrome aimed at broadening the diagnostic criteria applied currently to PTC. It is suggested that the pseudotumor syndrome has a single underlying mechanism (disturbed CSF circulation) and that recognition of this mechanism not only clarifies the pathophysiologic processes of PTC but also has important diagnostic and therapeutic implications. 
Corticobasal degeneration. A unique pattern of regional cortical oxygen hypometabolism and striatal fluorodopa uptake demonstrated by positron emission tomography. Corticobasal degeneration presents with an asymmetric akinetic-rigid syndrome, apraxia and combinations of supranuclear gaze palsy, myoclonus, and an alien limb. Six patients aged 59-77 yrs, diagnosed on clinical criteria as having corticobasal degeneration, have been studied with positron emission tomography using tracers of dopamine storage capacity and oxygen metabolism. Striatal 18F-6-fluorodopa uptake was reduced in an asymmetric pattern, caudate and putamen being involved in all cases. Uptake into medial frontal cortex was also impaired. Regional cortical oxygen metabolism was most significantly depressed in the superior and posterior temporal, inferior parietal, and occipital associated cortices. Within the frontal lobe, the hypometabolism was chiefly posterior. This unique combination of regional hypometabolism and disruption of the nigrostriatal system is discussed in relation to the clinical features of the disease and is compared with reported findings in other disorders of cognition and movement. 
Lymphoproliferative lesion of the hypoglossal nerve: case report. A rare case of a lymphoproliferative lesion in the hypoglossal nerve is reported. The patient, a 52-year-old woman, had symptoms identical with those of hypoglossal neurinoma. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a lesion at the left cerebellomedullary angle. The tumor was removed, and histopathological studies revealed that the tumor consisted predominantly of lymphocytes. 
Relevance of common tests of cerebrospinal fluid in screening for bacterial meningitis. This study tests the hypothesis that if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a nucleated blood cell count (NucBC) of less than 6/mm3, CSF tests other than bacterial culture need not be performed to exclude the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in patients not receiving antimicrobial agents. The results of tests performed on the first specimen of CSF obtained for a given hospital visit from children younger than 3 years of age, exclusive of newborn infants admitted to the hospital on their date of birth, were analyzed. Of 3356 CSF specimens evaluated, 122 were from patients with bacterial meningitis; 460 specimens were analyzed separately because the erythrocyte count was greater than 1000/mm3. A negative CSF screening test result was defined as a CSF NucBC less than 6/mm3. In facilitating the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, this screening test had a sensitivity of 98.4%, a specificity of 75.2%, and a negative predictive value of 99.9%. The other CSF tests varied widely in screening effectiveness: a Gram-stained smear had a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 97%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the screening relevance of CSF tests. The CSF NucBC and CSF segmented NucBC performed indistinguishably and superiorly compared with the CSF protein or glucose concentration and the ratio of CSF glucose to serum glucose concentration. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NucBC alone is superior to any combination of the other CSF tests. In a prospective study of 215 children younger than 3 years of age undergoing a lumbar puncture in our emergency department, 85% had empiric criteria identifying them as appropriate for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. The CSF NucBC was less than 6/mm3 in 70% of the 181 patients who would have been eligible for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. These data suggest that a strategy for the sequential testing of CSF could be adopted that would exclude unnecessary determinations and thereby save time, effort, and health care dollars. 
Medical problems of homeless and nonhomeless persons attending an inner-city clinic: a comparative study. The identification of homelessness as a national problem has focused attention on defining the needs of this sizable population. Existing studies on the medical problems of the homeless are largely descriptive and are limited by lack of comparison to nonhomeless persons. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we conducted a retrospective study of the medical problems of homeless and nonhomeless persons cared for in an outpatient clinic serving the medically indigent. Homeless persons (n = 150) were more likely to be identified as alcoholic and to be seen for cuts and gynecologic problems than nonhomeless persons (n = 154) (p less than .01). There were no significant differences in the occurrence of other illnesses considered to be prevalent in the homeless. This study is among the first that validates descriptive data on the health problems of homeless persons by using concurrent nonhomeless controls. It may help in designing programs to meet the medical needs of the homeless. 
Facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision: the patient's perspective. Facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision is currently accomplished using a variety of surgical techniques. A multi-institutional survey of patient perceptions of facial reanimation success was accomplished by mailing a questionnaire to 809 randomly selected members of the Acoustic Neuroma Association. Four hundred sixty patients who underwent 296 reanimation procedures responded. Facial to hypoglossal nerve anastomosis, tarsorrhaphy, and upper eyelid implants were most frequently performed. The patient's estimations of initial deficit, spontaneous recovery, and overall satisfaction with the reanimation procedures are discussed. 
Mass closure of the abdominal wound with delayed absorbable suture in surgery for gynecologic cancer. There has been a resurgence of interest recently in the optimal method of closure of the midline abdominal wound. The focus has been on the high-risk patient in particular. The controversy centers on interrupted versus continuous fascial closure and the choice of suture material. For three years on a gynecologic cancer service, running mass closure with delayed absorbable suture (Polyglactin) was used. Two hundred fifty-six patients were evaluable for analysis. The minimum follow-up time was two years. There was no wound dehiscence. Fourteen patients (5.5%) developed incisional hernias. The mass closure technique using delayed absorbable suture was effective in very-high-risk patients. 
Postoperative external alimentary tract fistulas. Most series dealing with external gastrointestinal fistulas cover experience of many years and include a heterogeneous sample of fistulas. We present our experience with 117 cases of postoperative external alimentary tract fistulas treated since 1980. Only fistulas caused by anastomotic leaks and operative injury to bowel are included. The overall mortality rate was 37%. The fistulas are classified into four types: type I-abdominal, esophagus, gastroduodenal (mortality rate, 17%); type II-small bowel (mortality rate, 33%); type III-large bowel (mortality rate, 20%), and type IV-all sites associated with a large abdominal wall defect (mortality rate, 60%). The main cause of death was intra-abdominal infection. Seventy-six percent of the patients required further operations. We conclude that despite the availability of all modern diagnostic and management facilities, postoperative external gastrointestinal fistulas treated during the 1980s continue to represent a surgical "disaster." Only prevention and improved methods in the management of the associated intra-abdominal infections could improve the results. 
High levels of serum soluble interleukin-2 receptors in hyperthyroid patients: correlation with serum thyroid hormones and independence from the etiology of the hyperthyroidism. The serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptors (s-IL-2R) and soluble CD8 antigens (s-CD8) were measured in 33 patients with Graves' disease (GD), 29 with toxic nodular goiter (TNG), 6 with toxic adenoma (TA), and 12 with hypothyroidism, as well as in 11 patients with infectious mononucleosis (known to have high s-IL-2R and s-CD8 levels) and 34 normal controls. Serum levels of T3 and T4, both total and free, and of TSH were simultaneously determined. s-IL-2R levels were significantly higher in all patients with hyperthyroidism (mean +/- SD, 3276 +/- 1273 U/mL for GD, 4183 +/- 1832 for TNG, and 1671 +/- 648 for TA) compared to normal control values (P less than 0.001 for GD and TNG and P less than 0.01 for TA), while in the euthyroid state they were within the normal range (535 +/- 240 U/mL). Hypothyroid patients had significantly lower s-IL-2R levels compared to normal controls (P less than 0.05). A positive correlation (P less than 0.001) between serum s-IL-2R levels and total/free T3-T4 levels was found in these groups of patients, while no correlation between s-CD8 levels and s-IL-2R/T3/T4 was found. These findings suggest an association between hyperthyroxinaemia and activation of human lymphocytes in vivo. 
Expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 in septic but not traumatic/hypovolemic shock in the baboon. Baboons were subjected to septic or traumatic/hypovolemic shock and their tissues were examined for the de novo expression of endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 (ELAM-1), using immunohistochemical techniques. In animals with septic shock induced with live Escherichia coli, there was widespread expression of ELAM-1, recognized by monoclonal antibodies H4/18 or ENA-1 in most tissues examined with strong staining in the lung, liver, and kidneys. Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule 1 expression was evident in capillaries, venules, small veins, arterioles, and arteries. In contrast, baboons with traumatic/hypovolemic shock had minimal levels of focal ELAM expression in all organs studied. Similarly evidence of neutrophil activation, measured by granulocyte elastase levels in the plasma was much more pronounced in animals with septic shock. The study documents that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and cytokine-induced endothelial activation occurs in vivo in septic shock. Much higher levels of ELAM-1 expression and plasma granulocyte-elastase titer in septic shock, as contrasted with traumatic/hypovolemic shock, are consistent with the higher levels of circulating tumor necrosis factor, other cytokines, and LPS in sepsis. 
Prevention of perioperative deep vein thrombosis in general surgery: a multicentre double blind study comparing two doses of Logiparin and standard heparin. H.B.P.M. Research Group. A total of 1290 patients were enrolled in a randomized multicentre double blind study in order to investigate the use of two doses of a new low molecular weight heparin, Logiparin, in the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in general surgery. Patients who were included had no contraindication to heparin therapy and had at least one of the recognized risk factors for DVT. Patients were randomized to receive unfractionated heparin (UH) 5000 units b.d., Logiparin 2500 units daily or Logiparin 3500 units daily. Each treatment was given subcutaneously 2 h before surgery and continued for 7-10 days. Daily 125I-labelled fibrinogen uptake tests (FUTs) were performed from day 2 to day 7 to detect DVT, and phleboangiography was used to confirm the diagnosis. The wound was examined on a daily basis to check for haematoma formation, and all patients were followed up for 1 month after operation. All three treatment arms were well matched for age, sex, weight, diagnosis and type of operation performed. The three major inclusion criteria in the trial were malignancy, age over 60 years and a history of varicose veins. Positive FUTs (UH = 4.2 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 7.9 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 3.7 per cent) and positive angiograms (UH = 3.0 per cent, Logiparin 2500 units daily = 5.6 per cent, Logiparin 3500 units daily = 2.3 per cent) were significantly more common in the Logiparin 2500 units daily group than in the UH and Logiparin 3500 units daily groups. The rates of major complications (severe haemorrhage, death, pulmonary embolism, reintervention) were similar in the three groups. 
Treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting with ondansetron: a randomized, double-blind comparison with placebo. Postoperative nausea and vomiting are common after recovery from general anesthesia. The antiemetic effect and safety of ondansetron, a selective serotonin type 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, was determined in 36 patients suffering from nausea or vomiting during recovery from intravenous anesthesia by giving either a single intravenous dose of ondansetron (8 mg, n = 18) or placebo (n = 18) over 2-5 min in a randomized, double-blind manner. A "rescue" antiemetic was provided in case of continued vomiting or at the patient's request. Antiemetic efficacy was defined as no request for rescue antiemetic and/or no vomiting episode during the next 4 h. There was no significant difference in the demographic data between the groups. Administration of ondansetron or placebo had no significant effect on vital signs. Ondansetron was an effective antiemetic in 78% (14/18) and placebo was effective in 28% (5/18) of the patients. Laboratory studies 24 h later showed no signs of hematologic, hepatic, or renal alterations. Ondansetron at a dose of 8 mg administered intravenously over 2-5 min appears to be a safe and effective antiemetic for the treatment of nausea and/or vomiting after intravenous anesthesia. 
Testicular injuries. We reviewed 91 testicular injuries in 86 patients (5 bilateral) as a result of blunt trauma in 72 patients and gunshot wounds in 14 patients. In 90 percent of the patients the injury was solitary. With blunt trauma initially conservative management led to the loss of the entire testis in 21 percent in comparison with only 6 percent of those explored promptly. The recent use of testicular ultrasonography has not differentiated intratesticular hematoma from rupture in the majority of cases of blunt trauma. Bilateral testicular injury occurred in 1 of 72 patients (1.4%) with blunt trauma versus 4 of 14 (29%) with penetrating trauma and affected the fertility in 3 of 4 patients on follow-up. 
Interleukin-3. Biologic effects and clinical impact. Human interleukin-3 (IL-3) is expressed in yeast and has a specific activity of 5 x 10(7) U/mg of protein. It exerts functional and proliferative effects on multiple hematopoietic cell lineages including the neutrophil, eosinophil, basophil, monocytic, and thrombopoietic cell lines. IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) share common binding capacities on hematopoietic cells. Each of these agents has entered clinical trials. The clinical experiences with IL-3 alone and in combination with GM-CSF in a Phase I/II trial are summarized in this report. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the Dundee technique A total of 61 patients was subjected to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The procedure was completed in 60 cases and converted to open operation in one (2 per cent). The morbidity rate was low (total 7 per cent, major 2 per cent, blood transfusion rate 5 per cent). The median duration of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiography was 135 min (range 65-270 min). The operation took less time to complete in patients with functioning gallbladders than in those with non-functioning fibrotic organs (median 120 versus 175 min). The majority of patients required opiate analgesia despite infiltration of the stab wounds with bupivacaine. The mean (s.d.) hospital stay was 2.9 (1.5) days. The median time to resume work or full activity after discharge was 11 days. 
Central motor pathways in patients with mirror movements. Central motor pathways were investigated in three patients with congenital mirror movements using magnetic motor cortex stimulation. Response thresholds, amplitudes and latencies were normal. The projection of the corticomotoneuronal pathways was assessed by placing the coil over the vertex and comparing the size of responses in the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles evoked by clockwise and anticlockwise coil currents. In normal subjects, right FDI responses are larger with clockwise currents than with anticlockwise currents at the same stimulation strength and vice versa. In two out of three patients with congenital mirror movements, this sensitivity of response amplitude to coil current direction was reversed. The third patient with congenital mirror movements and a fourth patient with acquired mirror movements had responses which were normally sensitive to current direction. These findings support the hypothesis that some cases of congenital mirror movements may be due to abnormal projection of corticomotoneuronal pathways. 
A selective deficit for writing vowels in acquired dysgraphia Brain-damaged patients with acquired writing disorders provide important information about the normal processes of spelling and writing. Current models indicate that to produce a letter string, its 'abstract' representation is computed and stored in a temporary orthographic buffer, from which it is converted to a verbal code (if the word is to be spelled aloud) or to a physical letter code (if the word is to be written). The stored graphemic representations specify the identity and order of the component letters and their consonant/vowel status. Here I describe the spelling performance of two patients with a selective deficit in writing vowels. When writing words, the first patient omitted all vowels, leaving a blank space between consonants or consonant clusters, whereas the second produced errors that almost exclusively involved vowels. This pattern of performance supports the hypothesis that the consonant/vowel status of graphemes is differentially specified in the spelling process and may be selectively affected after brain damage. 
Double dissociation of short-term and long-term memory for nonverbal material in Parkinson's disease and global amnesia. A further analysis. The traditional concept of memory disorder is deficiency of the long-term (LTM) but not short-term (STM) component of memory. STM impairment with LTM sparing is seldom reported. The present study investigated STM and LTM for nonverbal material in three neurological conditions associated with memory impairment: bilateral medial temporal lobe lesions (patient H.M.), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjects received 3 tests of nonverbal memory: forward block span, immediate and delayed recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale drawings, and immediate and delayed recognition of abstract designs. Compared with the normal control group, the patient groups displayed different patterns of sparing and loss of the two components of memory: in PD, only STM was impaired; in medial temporal lobe amnesia, only LTM was impaired; and in AD, STM and LTM were both impaired. The contrasting patterns of sparing and loss of STM and LTM in PD and global amnesia were present for both recognition and recall. These results provide evidence that STM and LTM are dissociable processes and are served by separate neurological systems: STM depends upon intact corticostriatal systems, whereas LTM depends upon intact medial temporal lobe systems. 
Melanosis and associated tumors in transgenic mice. Melanosis was found to various extents in a wide array of tissues of all 23 autopsied mice whose transgene consisted of the tyrosinase promoter fused to the simian virus 40 early-region oncogenic sequences. Pigmentation in a given animal was attributable to any or all of the following; an increase in numbers of some normally pigmented cells of neural crest origin (a result compatible with early stages of transformation); elicitation of melanin synthesis in some cells that normally have little melanin, or none at all (the latter possibly signaling metaplasia); unusual intercellular transfer of pigment granules from melanocytes into certain normally unpigmented epithelia and endothelia; and profusion of melanin-phagocytizing cells. Neoplasms, occasionally also containing melanin, arose in association with some of these melanotic tissues and included three choroid plexus tumors, three endocardial tumors, two peripheral nerve sheath tumors (schwannomas), two cochlear tumors, two pineal gland tumors, one salivary gland tumor, and one nasal mucosa tumor. These apparently originated independently of the ocular and cutaneous melanomas found in the same animals. The events involved in melanosis may thus contribute to neoplastic conversion. 
Seizures of fronto-orbital origin: a proven case. Distinguishing characteristics of seizures of frontal origin have not been clearly delineated. We describe a case of seizures of proven fronto-orbital origin to provide further definition of characteristics of seizures arising in that lobe. A 36-year-old man had medically intractable seizures since age 8 years. Clinically the seizures were stereotyped, with cessation of activity followed by turning of head and body to the right and then by struggling, kicking, and vocalizations indicating fear. Total seizure duration was approximately 30 s, with an apparent abrupt return of consciousness. The interictal scalp EEGs were similar to those of primary generalized epilepsy, with bisynchronous though asymmetric epileptiform activity anteriorly. Ictal scalp recordings were not localizing. Recordings from bilateral frontal and temporal subdural electrodes showed an electrical focus in the right fronto-orbital region which was confirmed by electrocorticography (ECoG) at the time of craniotomy. The right fronto-orbital cortex was resected and on pathologic examination showed gliotic tissue and intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules consistent with lipofuscinosis. The patient has remained seizure-free for 6 years after operation. 
Chylous ascites and lymphocyst management by peritoneovenous shunt. Although lymphocyst (retroperitoneal lymphocele) is not an uncommon complication after retroperitoneal surgery, with a reported incidence ranging from 0.6% to 48%, the occurrence of chylous ascites is a rare phenomenon. Most reports are anecdotal, and hospital records list the incidence of diagnosis as 0.001% of admissions. Diagnosis of chylous ascites is usually not difficult, inasmuch as aspiration and chemical analysis of the fluid yield the answer. Visualization of retroperitoneal fluid collection by computerized tomography or ultrasonography, however, does always raise the possibility of recurrence of tumor in cases where the primary operation was for cancer. Treatment of smaller lesions can be expectant. Respiratory exercises causing an increase in negative intrathoracic pressure may aid in the movement of fluid through the lymphatics. For larger collections, elemental diets and total parenteral nutrition are also often enough, but surgery is sometimes required. Simple insertion of a peritoneovenous shunt, as in this patient, can be as effective as major operations such as identification and ligation of the offending lymphatic or marsupialization of the cyst. 
Accuracy of endosonography in the staging of rectal cancer treated by radiotherapy. Endosonography is the best available method for the pretherapeutic staging of rectal cancer. The present prospective study was to determine the influence of previous radiotherapy, widely used in the management of this tumour, on the accuracy of endosonography. A complete endosonographic examination was performed just before surgery in 40 patients with rectal cancer. Endosonographic and pathological staging were compared in group A, 21 patients without previous radiotherapy, and group B, 19 patients with preoperative radiotherapy. While the endosonographic accuracy for lymph node involvement was similar in the two groups (85 per cent compared with 84 per cent), wall invasion was correctly ascertained in 86 per cent in group A but in only 47 per cent in group B (P less than 0.05). After irradiation, the thickening of the rectal wall and the poor visualization of the hyperechoic layers hampered interpretation. Post-radiotherapy inflammation and/or fibrosis probably explained the echographic changes. Radiotherapy therefore altered endosonographic staging of rectal cancer. New interpretation criteria are needed for evaluation and follow-up of rectal cancer treated by radiotherapy. 
Increased activation of isolated intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells in inflammatory bowel disease. Normal human lamina propria lymphocytes are in a heightened state of activation compared with peripheral blood with regard to cell-surface activation antigen expression (transferrin receptor, interleukin-2 receptor, 4F2) and the increased spontaneous secretion of immunoglobulins in vitro. This study evaluates the cell-surface expression of activation-associated antigens in different subpopulations of isolated colonic lamina propria mononuclear cells in inflammatory bowel disease. In pilot studies using three-color flow cytometry, autofluorescence was observed that was emitted by unstained lamina propria mononuclear cells, which interfered with both the sensitivity and the specificity of the analyses. Because a major portion of the intestinal lymphocyte populations of interest were autofluorescent, a method to remove autofluorescence signals was developed by designing a computer program for the subtraction of autofluorescence from the emissions of each individual cell. This technique increases both the sensitivity and specificity of flow-cytometric analyses of intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells. Using fluorescence-activated cell-sorter analyses with subtraction of autofluorescence on a single-cell basis, increased expression of lymphocyte activation antigens (interleukin-2 receptor, transferrin receptor, 4F2) was found on the cell surface of isolated intestinal B cells, T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Therefore, markedly increased intestinal lymphocyte activation is a major immunological alteration in inflammatory bowel disease and includes all lymphocyte subpopulations investigated in this study. In addition, 5-aminosalicylic acid, which is used for the treatment of intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel disease, inhibits the expression of cell-surface activation antigens on mitogen-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes in a dose-dependent manner. These observations suggest that lymphocyte activation may play an important role in underlying immune processes that lead to chronicity and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease and may implicate an additional mechanism for the therapeutic action of 5-aminosalicylic acid. 
A double-blinded, randomized trial of hydrocortisone in acute hepatic failure. The Acute Hepatic Failure Study Group. The Acute Hepatic Failure Study Group (AHFSG) has conducted a double-blinded, randomized evaluation of hydrocortisone in patients with acute hepatic failure. From July 1975 through August 1978, a 38-month period, 18 medical centers in the United States and one in Canada participated in this trial. A total of 64 patients were accessed and found eligible to participate in the study; two of them were subsequently eliminated from our analysis. Eighteen patients received placebo; 23 received 400 mg hydrocortisone per day, and 21 patients were administered 800 mg hydrocortisone per day. We did not observe any therapeutic effect of hydrocortisone, and the survival rates for placebo versus 400 mg and versus 800 mg hydrocortisone per day were 22%, 9%, and 24%, respectively. Fulminant hepatitis associated with drug hepatotoxicity or non-A, non-B hepatitis seemed to have a worse prognosis than fulminant B, although these differences were not significant. Serum alpha-fetoprotein had a modest prognostic value of survival and seemed to be limited to fulminant B. The AHFSG recommends, therefore, that corticosteroid use in acute hepatic failure with hepatic encephalopathy be discontinued. 
Management of patients aged over 60 years with supratentorial glioma: lessons from an audit. This audit of clinical management confirmed the poor prognosis for patients (n = 80) aged over 60 years with a diagnosis of supratentorial glioma. The median survival time after diagnosis was 9 weeks following steroids and 7 weeks after biopsy and steroids. Cytoreductive surgery and radiotherapy improved median survival time by a maximum of 16 weeks, but there was significant morbidity in some patients undergoing craniotomy. Although 92% of the biopsied lesions were either glioblastoma or anaplastic astrocytoma, the median survival of these patients was similar to the 8% of patients confirmed as having intermediate grade astrocytoma. Patients presenting with minimal functional deficit (WHO grade I or II) had longer median survival times than those presenting in poor condition (WHO grade III or IV). In this series there was no relationship between management undertaken and clinical status of the patient. The 9% of the cohort that survived 1 year were treated in a variety of ways. This audit, together with results from other studies, suggests that a prospective clinical trial of different management regimes in elderly patients with supratentorial gliomas is needed. Since median survival time in the most intensively treated patients will be around 6 months, treatment evaluation must consider the quality of life provided. 
Diagnosis and treatment of cranial neuralgias. Both medical and surgical therapies may be used in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia and glossopharyngeal neuralgia. Ordinarily, the treatment is medical; however, if a response to drugs is not forthcoming, or if the patient becomes toxic while taking medications or refuses to abide by an appropriate medical program, then surgical consultation should be obtained and the appropriate operation performed. The form and type of neurosurgical procedure will probably depend to a considerable extent on the expertise of the neurosurgeon and his training. Generally, in the elderly, the simplest procedure should be attempted first. It may be necessary to employ both medical and surgical procedures in the individual patient. The medical drug of first choice is carbamazepine. Atypical facial neuralgia is a general term used to cover a variety of head and face pains that are poorly defined and that may not deserve separate clinical status. The pathogenesis of the atypical facial neuralgias is uncertain, and multiple causation seems likely. Search for local inflammatory pathology, neoplasms, vasomotor phenomena, and depressive symptoms is indicated. Treatment should be guided by the findings. 
Helicobacter pylori in children with peptic ulcer and their families. Little is known about the source and spread of Helicobacter pylori, but transmission from infected family contacts has been suggested. We have therefore investigated 15 children with peptic ulcer and their first-degree relatives for H. pylori. Serum anti-H. pylori IgG, pepsinogen I, and gastrin levels were measured. Endoscopy was carried out on the children and relatives, and biopsies were taken from the gastric antrum for histology, microbiology, and urease testing. Six of 11 children with duodenal ulcer (55%) and two of four children with gastric ulcer (50%) were positive for H. pylori. Fourteen of 16 parents (87%) and eight of 13 siblings (61%) of H. pylori-positive children with peptic ulcer were also infected compared with eight of 14 parents (57%) and none of four siblings of H. pylori-negative children with peptic ulcer (P less than 0.10, greater than 0.05, and NS, respectively). The children with H. pylori-negative peptic ulcer and negative siblings combined were younger than positive children with peptic ulcer and positive siblings (P less than 0.001). The reliability of serum anti-H. pylori IgG level as a screening test for infection was confirmed. These findings call into question a pathogenetic role for H. pylori in some childhood peptic ulceration, but do suggest that person-to-person spread of infection occurs. 
Noninvasive diagnosis of vascular trauma by duplex ultrasonography. Duplex ultrasonography was used prospectively in the initial evaluation of 198 patients with 319 potential vascular injuries of the neck and extremities. Patients who were unstable or who had obvious arterial trauma were excluded. Injury was caused by gunshot in 104 (53%), blunt trauma in 42 (21%), stab wound in 34 (17%), and shotgun in 18 (9%). Duplex ultrasonography correctly characterized and localized vascular injuries in 23 patients: arterial disruptions (13), intimal flaps (4), acute pseudoaneurysms (3), arteriovenous fistulas (2), and shotgun pellet arteriopuncture (1). Nineteen other patients had vasospasm (13) or external compression (6) without evidence of intrinsic vessel injury, these 42 studies had true-positive results. Twenty patients underwent arterial repair (13 on the basis of duplex ultrasonography alone), one had primary amputation, three required fasciotomy, and 18 were observed. Two patients with false-negative results had minor shotgun pellet arteriopunctures that were missed by duplex ultrasonography, but neither needed repair. One hundred fifty-three patients had true-negative results on duplex ultrasonography: all clinically had only proximity injuries and easily palpable distal pulses. The result of one duplex ultrasonography study was found to be false-positive on arteriography. The sensitivity of duplex ultrasonography was 95%, the specificity was 99%, and the overall accuracy was 98%. These results closely approximate those reported with the use of exclusion arteriography in the evaluation of similar vascular trauma patients. Furthermore, duplex ultrasonography has no interventional risks and is more cost-effective for screening such injuries than arteriography or exploration. Duplex ultrasonography is a reliable method of diagnosis in patients with potential peripheral vascular injuries. 
Positron emission tomography demonstrates that coronary sinus retroperfusion can restore regional myocardial perfusion and preserve metabolism. Positron emission tomography was used to image blood flow and metabolic tracers in risk zone myocardium after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion during synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion. Six control and seven intervention open chest dogs had occlusion of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery. Synchronized retroperfusion commenced 25 min later. Flow tracers (rubidium-82 and nitrogen-13 ammonia) were injected retrogradely. Three hours after coronary occlusion, fluorine-18 (F-18) deoxyglucose uptake in the control and treatment groups was compared. At 200 min of occlusion, infarct size was assessed. Retrograde flow tracer uptake was observed in the risk zone in the seven intervention dogs. Fluorine-18 deoxyglucose uptake in the risk zone was increased in five of the six intervention dogs but was reduced in five of the six control dogs. The risk zone to normal zone F-18 deoxyglucose count ratio was higher in the intervention than the control group (1.13 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.59 +/- 0.51; p less than 0.05). The endocardial subsegment risk zone to normal zone F-18 deoxyglucose count ratio was also significantly higher in the intervention group. Percent infarction in the risk zone was 70% lower in the group treated with synchronized retroperfusion than in the control group (18.4 +/- 22.6% vs. 61.2 +/- 25.4%; p less than 0.02). Thus, positron emission tomography revealed that retroperfusion could deliver oxygenated blood and maintain metabolism in risk zone myocardium. Infarct size was limited to 30% of that of control. In acute closure of the left anterior descending coronary artery, synchronized retroperfusion might be considered for maintaining viability of the jeopardized myocardium if the artery cannot be reopened rapidly. 
Lamina repair and replacement to control laminectomy membrane formation in dogs. This study examined the efficacy of lamina repair by the use of various techniques to prevent postlaminectomy scar formation in a canine system. Five-level noncontiguous laminectomies were performed on six adult canines. The most caudal (Site 1) was left uncovered and served as the control. Exposed dura at each of the remaining four levels was covered with one of the following: Site 2, free autogenous laminar bone graft; Site 3, polymethylmethacrylate; Site 4, Teflon-Proplast composite; Site 5, collagen gel. The dogs used in the study were killed 16 weeks after surgery. Three specimens were examined by plain roentgenography and computerized tomography, two specimens were examined histologically, and the remaining four specimens were graded according to scar volume and scar adherence, as detected during gross dissection of the postlaminectomy scar. No repair technique interfered with roentgenography evaluation. The least scar and fewest adhesions were present under the free bone graft repair site. The Teflon-Proplast composite and polymethylmethacrylate both limited the amount and adherence of scar. Collagen gel and control sites were indistinguishable in this study. It is concluded that lamina repair with a solid material covering exposed dura significantly reduces the formation of postlaminectomy membrane and scar. 
2-D echocardiography: emergent use in the evaluation of penetrating precordial trauma. Diagnosis of cardiac injury in stable patients suffering penetrating precordial trauma has relied on observation, subxiphoid window, or exploratory thoracotomy. Previous reports have stressed the need for an alternative noninvasive diagnostic test. Although the use of echocardiography (ECHO) in this patient population has been suggested, to our knowledge no report thus far has presented extensive experience with this technique. We present our experience over 3 years with 36 patients in whom emergent ECHO was used as part of their initial work-up. Injuries included single stab wounds (17), multiple stab wounds (14), and gunshot wounds (5). Four patients (11%) had jugular venous distention, and 12 (33%) were tachycardic. None had a systolic blood pressure below 90 mm Hg. Four ECHOs (11%) were positive for pericardial effusion. No valvular abnormalities were detected. Three of the effusions were small and these patients were triaged to monitored beds and observed. All three effusions resolved on serial echocardiography. The fourth patient underwent an uneventful operative repair of a left ventricular laceration. Although the yield is low, emergent 2-D ECHO is a valuable tool in the triage of stable penetrating trauma patients when cardiac injury is suspected. Patients without effusion can be discharged or triaged to a ward bed. Small effusions can be observed in a monitored setting with serial examinations, while large effusions should be treated surgically. Echocardiography is less expensive than ICU admission and less invasive than either subxiphoid window or thoracotomy. There are no known complications associated with the procedure and it is recommended for emergent use when available. 
Mechanisms involved in the response to prolonged infusion of atrial natriuretic factor in patients with chronic heart failure. We examined the mechanisms involved in the cardiovascular and renal response to prolonged infusion of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in patients with chronic heart failure. ANF infusion was titrated to produce a 30% decrease in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure or a 20% increase in cardiac output, and this dose (average, 75 +/- 4 ng/kg/min) was then administered for 20 hours. The short-term response to ANF included significant reductions in central filling pressures, increases in cardiac output, modest increases in diuresis and glomerular filtration rates, significant reduction in plasma aldosterone levels, and a 3.6-fold increase in plasma cyclic GMP levels. During prolonged infusion, plasma cGMP levels and cardiac output gradually returned to baseline. Similarly, the initially increased diuretic effects were completely abolished during prolonged ANF infusion, although plasma alpha-hANF levels remained consistently elevated above baseline values (control, 198 +/- 38; titration, 2,760 +/- 596; 20 hours, 3,499 +/- 659 pg/ml). Four hours after beginning the ANF infusion, marked increases in hematocrit levels were noted (42.5 +/- 1.0% versus 45.3 +/- 1.4%, control and infusion, respectively, p less than 0.05); during this time, no change in total plasma protein concentration occurred, indicating extravascular shift of fluid and plasma proteins. No evidence was noted for activation of vasoconstrictor hormones during prolonged ANF infusion, although mean arterial pressure was significantly reduced throughout the infusion period. Plasma pro-ANF (31-67) levels, determined as a marker for endogenous ANF secretion, were significantly suppressed as were the reductions of central filling pressures. After ANF discontinuation, heart rate and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased significantly above baseline values without evidence for sympathetic stimulation. We conclude that 1) prolonged infusion of ANF causes only transient increases in plasma cGMP levels but a sustained reduction of the cardiac release of ANF and that 2) the beneficial hemodynamic effects of ANF, that is, unloading of the ventricles, may be associated with or, in part, may be secondary to a shift of plasma constituents into the extravascular space. The latter may limit the therapeutic potential of ANF for long-term treatment. 
Rhodococcus equi infection in the patient with AIDS: literature review and report of an unusual case. Rhodococcus equi is an aerobic, intracellular, gram-positive rod-coccus that is partially acid fast. The organism is primarily a pathogen in animals and has only rarely been seen in immunocompromised humans. Its most common manifestation is a slowly progressive pneumonia that may cavitate. Infections are thought to be acquired via respiratory exposure to animals or soil. R. equi infections are difficult to treat, usually requiring prolonged administration of parenteral antibiotics and often necessitating surgical drainage. A case of cavitary pneumonia and recurrent bacteremia with R. equi in a patient with AIDS is reported, and the current literature on R. equi infections in humans is reviewed. 
Cognitive laboratory approach to designing questionnaires for surveys of the elderly. Data from surveys of the elderly are used by policy analysts to design health services programs. Consequently, the quality of survey data on elderly respondents has important implications for this growing segment of society: improving the quality of data should result in more cost effective programs for the elderly. However, studies suggest that the quality of responses from the elderly may be less than that for other respondents. Moreover, the increasing needs of policy analysts and health researchers for data have resulted in more complex survey questions that place a high cognitive burden on respondents. New methods for improving the design of these questionnaires are needed. This project investigated whether new techniques of questionnaire design, adapted from the theories and methods of cognitive psychology, could be effectively used in interviewing older respondents. The techniques used in this study, concurrent think-aloud interviews with followup probe questions, have been shown recently to be effective with younger respondents. Problems that elderly respondents have in comprehending survey questions, retrieving relevant information from memory, and using decision processes to estimate and provide answers were investigated. Questions on functional ability and social support were taken from the 1984 Supplement on Aging to the National Health Interview Survey. Analysis of respondents' think-aloud protocols and responses to probes suggest that the cognitive interview procedures were effective in identifying problems with the survey questions that would result in data of poorer quality and in suggesting the wording of questions that would be likely to result in answers of greater validity and reliability. Implications of these results for survey design and validation studies are discussed. 
Vagal stimulation and prevention of sudden death in conscious dogs with a healed myocardial infarction. The interest for the antifibrillatory effect of vagal stimulation has been largely limited by the fact that this concept seemed restricted to acute experiments in anesthetized animals. To explore the potentially protective role of vagal stimulation in conscious animals we developed a chronically implantable device to be placed around the cervical right vagus. An anterior myocardial infarction was produced in 161 dogs; 1 month later an exercise stress test was performed on the 105 survivors. Toward the end of the test the circumflex coronary artery was occluded for 2 minutes. Fifty-nine (56%) dogs developed ventricular fibrillation and, before this test was repeated, were assigned either to a control group (n = 24) or to be instrumented with the vagal device (n = 35). Five dogs were excluded because of electrode malfunction. Compared with the heart rate level attained after 30 seconds of occlusion during exercise in the control test, vagal stimulation led to a decrease of approximately 75 beats/min (from 255 +/- 33 to 170 +/- 36 beats/min, p less than 0.001). In the control group 22 (92%) of 24 dogs developed ventricular fibrillation during the second exercise and ischemia test. By contrast, during vagal stimulation ventricular fibrillation occurred in only 3 (10%) of the 30 dogs tested and recurred in 26 (87%) during an additional exercise and ischemia test in the control condition (p less than 0.001 versus the vagal stimulation test; internal control analysis). Combined analysis of the tests performed in the control condition showed that ventricular fibrillation was reproducible in 48 (89%) of the 54 dogs tested. The protective effect of vagal stimulation was also significant in the group comparison analysis and even after exclusion of those four dogs in which ventricular fibrillation was not reproducible (92% versus 11.5%, control versus vagal stimulation, p less than 0.001). When heart rate was kept constant by atrial pacing, the vagally mediated protection was still significant (p = 0.015) as five (55%) of nine dogs survived the test. This study shows that vagal stimulation, performed shortly after the onset of an acute ischemic episode in conscious animals with a healed myocardial infarction, can effectively prevent ventricular fibrillation. This striking result seems to depend on multiple mechanisms having a synergistic action. The decrease in heart rate is an important but not always essential protective mechanism. The electrophysiological effects secondary to the vagally mediated antagonism of the sympathetic activity on the heart are likely to play a major role. 
Prophylactic sclerotherapy for esophageal varices in men with alcoholic liver disease. A randomized, single-blind, multicenter clinical trial. The Veterans Affairs Cooperative Variceal Sclerotherapy Group. BACKGROUND. Sclerotherapy is an effective treatment for bleeding esophageal varices in patients with alcoholic liver disease. It has also been suggested that sclerotherapy might be effective in preventing initial episodes of bleeding and improving survival among such patients. METHODS. We conducted a prospective, randomized trial comparing prophylactic sclerotherapy and sham therapy in 281 men with alcoholic liver disease who had at least three variceal channels and no history of variceal bleeding. All the patients underwent endoscopy; 143 received sclerotherapy, and 138 received sham therapy. RESULTS. The two patient groups were well matched at entry with respect to the extent of liver disease and other clinical indexes, except that other medical illnesses were significantly more common in the sclerotherapy group. The study's data-monitoring board terminated the trial 22.5 months after it began because the rate of mortality from all causes was significantly higher in the sclerotherapy group (32.2 percent) than in the sham-therapy group (17.4 percent, P = 0.004), despite the fact that the men who received sclerotherapy had significantly fewer episodes of esophageal variceal bleeding. The causes of death varied, and there is no obvious explanation for the excess mortality in the sclerotherapy group. After the termination of treatment, the excess mortality rate in the sclerotherapy group promptly declined. There were 53 episodes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (including 10 from esophageal varices and 9 from esophageal ulcers) in the sclerotherapy group and 40 episodes (including 19 from esophageal varices) in the sham-therapy group. Complications of sclerotherapy were frequent but seldom life-threatening. CONCLUSIONS. For unknown reasons, prophylactic sclerotherapy is associated with increased mortality among men with moderate-to-severe alcoholic liver disease and esophageal varices. Sclerotherapy should not be performed until after an initial episode of bleeding from esophageal varices has occurred. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. This article describes the first 50 laparoscopic cholecystectomies emphasizing the two-handed technique that is currently used at Marietta Surgical Center, Marietta, Georgia. This procedure has become primarily an outpatient procedure with resumption of normal activities in 7 days (including athletics). Two patients in this series had complications. One patients was converted to an open procedure because of a common duct injury. The other patient developed a biloma 2 weeks following surgery and recovered uneventfully following paracentesis on an outpatient basis. 
Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of diastolic dysfunction. Recently, considerable effort has been directed toward the application of Doppler methods for detecting diastolic dysfunction. Recordings of transmitral filling velocity as obtained from pulsed-wave Doppler have been extensively investigated as a noninvasive method for determining left ventricular diastolic filling properties. Although Doppler parameters appear to reflect volumetric transmitral flow, close correlations with invasive descriptors of diastolic performance have not been found. Furthermore, Doppler transmitral velocities are sensitive to changes in ventricular preload, afterload, and heart rate. However, at least two distinct Doppler spectral patterns have been identified that are associated with impaired ventricular relaxation and restrictive physiology. Thus, Doppler recordings have proven to be of value in identifying the presence and type of diastolic dysfunction, and in the future they may be helpful in following the response to therapeutic interventions. The purpose of this paper is to review the available information relating Doppler transmitral recordings with catheterization and clinical descriptors of diastolic function. Additionally, the aim is to provide an understanding of the value and limitations of these noninvasive measurements in identifying and treating patients with diastolic abnormalities. 
The role of endoscopic papillotomy in ascending cholangitis. The role of endoscopic papillotomy in calculous cholangitis is unclear. A retrospective review of 41 patients admitted to hospital with calculous cholangitis was carried out. There were 30 women and 11 men and their ages ranged between 49 and 98 years (mean age 77). All patients presented with abdominal pain, tenderness, chills, and fever. Clinical jaundice was present in 95 per cent of the patients. Initial endoscopic papillotomy was successful in 17 of the 41 patients. In 24 patients cholangitis persisted or recurred and further therapy was carried out. Surgery was successful in controlling sepsis in ten of the 24 patients. Repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in four of 13 patients. Surgery was successful in one of nine patients who had failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. Nasobiliary drainage and percutaneous transhepatic drainage of the common bile duct after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy was successful in only two of nine patients. Six patients died after failed repeat endoscopic papillotomy. We conclude that initial endoscopic papillotomy should be attempted in patients with calculous cholangitis. Surgical exploration of the common bile duct should then be carried out if initial endoscopic papillotomy fails to control cholangitis. 
Feeding strategies for the dysphagic patient: a nursing perspective. The goal of treatment for the dysphagic patient is to maintain safe oral feeding. Achieving this goal requires an individualized care plan using selected feeding strategies. This care plan will need to be altered as changes in the patient's condition occur. 
Fibreoptic bronchoscopy without general anaesthetic. We have used flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy using sedation and local anaesthesia in 50 children aged 2-19 years (median 10) using an Olympus BFP20 instrument. Indications were opportunistic pneumonias (n = 11), persistent atelectasis (n = 11), recurrent pneumonia (n = 7), miscellaneous lower airway disease (n = 7), recurrent wheezing (n = 3), haemoptysis (3), to diagnose infection or rejection of heart-lung transplants (n = 3), stridor (n = 2), suspected airway compression (n = 1), evaluation of tracheostomy (n = 1), and suspected foreign body (n = 1). In 43 cases (86%) the diagnosis was related to the primary indication. In five (10%) unrelated abnormalities were found, and five (10%) were normal. In 13 (26%) treatment was altered as a result of flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy. Complications were transient respiratory arrest (n = 2), hypoxia (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), and laryngospasm (n = 1). All complications were followed by complete recovery. Our results suggest that flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy is safe. Advantages over rigid bronchoscopy include greater visual range, fewer complications, and the avoidance of a general anaesthetic. Though invasive it can yield important diagnostic and therapeutic information. 
Characterization of an insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP-4) produced by the B104 rat neuronal cell line: chemical and biological properties and differential synthesis by sublines. A previous report from our laboratory described an approximately 30 kilodalton (kDa) insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP) that inhibited the binding of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) by its receptor and was secreted by a subline of the B104 rat neuronal cell line. To better understand the biology of this IGFBP, it was purified from media conditioned by these B104 cells, and the chemical and biological properties of the protein were examined. The IGFBP existed as a 24 kDa form and a 28 kDa form when the conditioned media were analyzed by ligand blot. Deglycosylation studies indicated the 28 kDa species was the N-linked glycosylated form of the 24 kDa IGFBP. Multiple forms at both mol wts were found using two-dimensional electrophoresis, suggesting that there were posttranslational modifications in addition to glycosylation. The amino acid sequence of the 12 amino-terminal residues was identical to that of rat IGFBP-4. Increased synthesis of IGFBP-4 by the subline contrasted with neglible production by other B104 cells. Blot hybridization with rat IGFBP-4 complementary DNA showed differential expression of a 2.6 kilobase transcript among B104 cell lines that correlated with quantities of IGFBP-4 secreted in media. The difference persisted even when the cells were xenografted into athymic nude mice. Purified IGFBP-4 inhibited the binding of [125I]IGF-I by its receptor and blunted stimulation of [3H]thymidine incorporation by IGF-I. These findings suggest a role for IGFBP-4 in neural cell function and indicate the B104 cell lines may be a useful model for further examination of IGFBP-4 biology. 
Phase III comparison of doxorubicin and dacarbazine given by bolus versus infusion in patients with soft-tissue sarcomas: a Southwest Oncology Group study. Disseminated soft-tissue sarcomas are a group of uncommon malignancies generally treated in a uniform manner. This study questioned the impact of schedule on response rate and toxicity in patients with metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma treated with the two-drug combination doxorubicin and dacarbazine. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either bolus therapy with doxorubicin at a dose of 60 mg/m2 and dacarbazine at a dose of 750 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 (118 patients) or infusional therapy with doxorubicin at 60 mg/m2 and dacarbazine at 750 mg/m2 delivered by continuous intravenous infusion for 96 hours on days 1-4 (122 patients). Chemotherapy was to be repeated every 3 weeks. A unique feature of this cooperative group protocol was a provision for surgical resection of residual disease in patients with a partial response or with stable disease following chemotherapy. Similar overall response rates (17% in both treatment arms) and complete response rates (5% in both treatment arms) were observed. For patients receiving bolus therapy, the median response duration was 19.6 months for those in complete remission and 6.6 months for those in partial remission. For patients receiving infusional therapy, the median response duration was 12.6 months for those in complete remission and 9.3 months for those in partial remission. Examination of dose intensity received when combining treatment arms revealed a weak doxorubicin dose-response relationship. There was no difference in median survival times between the two treatment arms (bolus therapy, 10.6 months; infusional therapy, 10.5 months; logrank P = .97). Analysis of toxic effects favored infusional therapy. Significant reductions in cardiac toxicity (all events, P = .04; clinical events, P = .01) and nausea and emesis (P = .04) were seen in infusional therapy. Of 47 patients eligible for cytoreductive surgery following chemotherapy, 12 received surgery, and of those 12, eight were rendered disease free. The use of a 96-hour continuous intravenous infusion of doxorubicin-dacarbazine was comparable therapeutically with bolus dosing of these two agents and was better tolerated by the patients. 
Association between antiphospholipid antibodies and cardiac abnormalities in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. PURPOSE: Although the antiphospholipid antibodies are well recognized to be associated with thrombosis, recurrent abortion, and thrombocytopenia in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), their relationship with cardiac disease is less clear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between anti-phospholipid antibodies and cardiac abnormalities in patients with SLE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 75 consecutive SLE patients and 60 healthy sex- and age-matched control subjects were evaluated in a case-control study. All participants underwent M-mode, two-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiography. Antiphospholipid antibodies levels were assayed in each patient. The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with and without echocardiographic abnormalities was compared. RESULTS: Compared with the control group, SLE patients had significantly more pericardial abnormalities, left ventricular hypertrophy, left atrial enlargement, left ventricular dysfunction and verrucous valvular thickening, global valvular thickening with dysfunction, and mitral and aortic regurgitation. Among these abnormalities, antiphospholipid antibodies were significantly associated with isolated left ventricular (global or segmental) dysfunction (four of five positive; p less than 0.05), verrucous valvular (mitral or aortic) thickening (seven of nine positive; p less than 0.005), global valvular (mitral or aortic) thickening and dysfunction (five of six positive; p less than 0.02), as well as mitral regurgitation (16 of 19 positive; p less than 0.001) and aortic regurgitation (five of six positive; p less than 0.02). CONCLUSION: Valvular lesions and myocardial dysfunction are associated with elevated antiphospholipid antibodies. This study has important implications for the pathogenic role of anti-phospholipid antibodies in relation to these cardiac abnormalities. 
Mitochondrial encephalopathies: molecular genetic diagnosis from blood samples. Point mutations of mitochondrial DNA have been described in the muscle of patients with syndromes of myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibres (MERRF) and of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We have found the MERRF mutation in members of 6 British kindreds; 2 of these had unusual phenotypes but all index patients had myoclonus. The MELAS mutation was detected in 17 patients from 16 families, who had a wide range of clinical features that particularly affected the central nervous system; stroke-like episodes were observed in 10.3 patients with mitochondrial DNA mutations did not have ragged red fibres on muscle biopsy, generally considered to be the morphological hallmark of mitochondrial diseases. In all 6 patients with the MERRF mutation, and 10 of 11 with the MELAS mutation, the genetic defect was easily detected in blood cells as well as muscle (blood samples were not available in 6 patients with MELAS mutations in muscle). Molecular genetic analysis of blood samples represents an inexpensive and reliable screening test for mitochondrial encephalopathies, and use of such techniques could influence diagnosis and genetic counselling in patients with seizure disorders and young-onset stroke. 
Pyroelectric vidicon thermography and cold challenge quantify the severity of Raynaud's phenomenon. Thermographic images of the hands of patients with primary and secondary Raynaud's phenomenon and of a group of normal subjects, recorded before and after cold provocation using a pyroelectric vidicon thermal imaging system, showed differences in thermal distribution patterns that were characteristic of primary Raynaud's phenomenon (RP), scleroderma (RS) and normal, and were exaggerated by cold provocation. The responses to cold challenge, assessed by computing the mean temperature of the hand as it recovered from cold challenge and plotting these values against time to produce a rewarming curve, were also characteristic of the patient and the normal groups, and gave an indication of the severity of circulatory impairment. Methods are described for the simple numerical characterization of these parameters. 
The low risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients dispensed corticosteroids. PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with corticosteroids. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding was assessed in a cohort of 19,880 patients from the Michigan Medicaid billing database with dermatitis and/or asthma treated with corticosteroids during 1980 to 1984. The frequency of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was assessed within 60 days after each corticosteroid prescription. RESULTS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients without a past history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were exposed to corticosteroids was only 2.8 cases per 10,000 person-months. The rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was notably higher in patients receiving anticoagulants and those with a prior history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (23.0 and 15.9 cases per 10,000 person-months, respectively). CONCLUSION: Because the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in ambulatory patients treated with corticosteroids is so low, prophylactic therapy should be restricted to high-risk patients, if it is to be used at all. 
Caseating cutaneous granulomas in a patient with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia. A 34-year-old man with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia, bronchiectasis, and chronic liver disease had a papular eruption on the trunk and upper extremities. A biopsy specimen revealed caseating granulomas, but special stains, cultures, and electron microscopy failed to reveal an infectious organism. Immunohistochemistry showed that the lymphocytes within the granulomas were almost exclusively of the CD8+ cytotoxic/suppressor T phenotype. Phenotypic analysis of the circulating lymphocytes showed normal numbers of CD4+ (helper/inducer) and CD8+ T cells, whereas B cells were undetectable. Other examples of noninfectious granulomatous disease have been reported in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia, but this is the first case of caseating cutaneous granulomatous disease to be reported in a patient with X-linked infantile hypogammaglobulinemia. 
High risk of human papillomavirus infection and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions among women with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection. We investigated the relationship of human papillomavirus (by cervicovaginal lavage and Southern blot), human immunodeficiency virus, and squamous intraepithelial lesions in 96 high-risk women in the Bronx, New York. Antibodies for human immunodeficiency virus were detected in 51 (53%) women. Of the 33 women with symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus infection, 23 (70%) had human papillomavirus infection compared with 4 of 18 (22%) asymptomatic women who were human immunodeficiency virus seropositive and 10 of 45 (22%) uninfected women (p less than 0.0001). The rate of squamous intraepithelial lesions was 52% (14 of 27) for women with both viruses detected, 18% (6 of 34) for women with either virus detected, and 9% (3 of 35) for uninfected women. Among symptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected women, a strong association between human papillomavirus infection and squamous intraepithelial lesions was demonstrated (odds ratio, 12; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 108). Risk was highest for younger women from ethnic or racial minority groups. Advanced human immunodeficiency virus-related disease, with its associated immunosuppression, seems to exacerbate human papillomavirus-mediated cervical cytologic abnormalities. Public health measures are needed to provide Papanicolaou smear screening and appropriate clinical follow-up and treatment for women at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus infection. 
The effect of the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis on renal blood flow in fetal sheep. Treatment with prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors has been associated with oligohydramnios in the fetus. The presumed mechanism is a reduction in fetal renal blood flow. We examined the effect of meclofenamate administration on renal blood flow in chronically catheterized fetal sheep during normoxia and during moderate and severe hypoxia. Ten fetal sheep were made hypoxic twice at least 4 days after surgery: once in the presence and once in the absence of meclofenamate infusion. Renal blood flow and combined ventricular output were measured with radioactive microspheres. Prostaglandin synthesis blockade with meclofenamate caused no significant change in blood pressure, combined ventricular output, renal blood flow, or renal vascular resistance in either the normoxic or hypoxic animals. These data challenge the contention that prostaglandin activity protects the renal vascular bed of the fetus from vasoconstriction during hypoxia and they also do not support the hypothesis that prostaglandin synthesis inhibition causes oligohydramnios through reduction of fetal renal blood flow. 
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcoma of the male genitalia: management with radiation therapy. Kaposi's sarcoma of the genitalia is an infrequent complication of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but it often is difficult to manage. A total of 19 men (mean age 39 years) with penile and/or scrotal lesions underwent radiotherapy at dosages of 600 to 3,000 cGy. in fractions of 150 to 800 cGy. Of the patients 6 achieved a complete and 10 a partial response, while 2 had no response and 1 died too soon after treatment to be evaluated. Recurrences were noted in 8 patients, 7 of whom received additional radiation (1 patient had 2 recurrences and both responded). Of the retreatments 3 effected complete and 4 partial responses. Over-all, of 25 evaluable treatment courses 9 complete (36%) and 14 partial (56%) responses yielded a total response rate of 92%. There was 1 complication, a skin ulceration. Radiation therapy is well tolerated and will result in effective palliation in the majority of patients with Kaposi's sarcoma of the genitalia. 
Imaging the pleura: sonography, CT, and MR imaging. A variety of imaging techniques can be used to evaluate the pleura and the pleural space. Standard radiographs are the most common. In this article, however, we review the use of three other imaging techniques: sonography, CT, and MR imaging. Sonography allows easy identification of pleural fluid and loculation and differentiation from pleural masses; CT is best for characterizing location and composition of pleural masses; MR is somewhat limited, but is best for imaging superior sulcus carcinoma. 
Bowel perforation and interstitial cystitis in childhood systemic lupus erythematosus. A 13-year-old girl presented with abdominal pain, fever, dysuria, incontinence and pyuria and was subsequently diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with extensive gastrointestinal involvement and an associated interstitial cystitis. Despite aggressive therapy with high dose prednisone and cyclophosphamide she developed a small bowel perforation and subsequently died. The combination of bowel symptoms and interstitial cystitis seems unique to the population with SLE, while the separate complication of bowel perforation carries an extremely poor prognosis in this group of patients. 
Retinoid-induced ear malformations. Treatment of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats with retinoic acid or etretinate pregnancy day 8.5 to 9.0 resulted in craniofacial defects in 100% of the embryos. A morphologic investigation of the malformations occurring in the ear was performed. Outer ears were missing, microtic, low-placed, and dorsally situated. External acoustic meatus was short or absent. Middle ear structures were delayed in differentiation, middle ear ossicle primordia were hypoplastic and malformed, the stapedial artery and facial nerve were hypoplastic, and their relation to the stapes was variable. In the inner ear, the otic capsule was thick, the cochlea had fewer turns and the semicircular ducts showed poor differentiation. 
Increased survival, limb preservation, and prognostic factors for osteosarcoma. Preoperative intraarterial (IA) cisplatin (CDP) was administered to 92 patients with nonmetastatic osteosarcoma. The ages of the patients ranged from 4 to 28 years. Sixty-four patients (70%) received 2 or 3 preoperative courses and 28 (30%) received 4 or more. Sixty-two specimens were available for pathologic examination to assess the degree of tumor necrosis. More than 90% tumor destruction was observed in 16 of 42 patients (38%) who received 1 to 3 preoperative courses as opposed to 17 of 20 (85%) who received 4 or more courses. Patients who received 4 or more courses had a 2-fold probability of achieving more than 90% tumor necrosis, and 68% underwent conservative surgery. Of those who received 3 or less courses, 23% underwent conservative surgery. Postoperatively, patients were treated with intravenous (IV) CDP alternating with doxorubicin (ADR) (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH). Pulmonary metastases developed in 36 patients, bone metastases in 2, and local recurrence in 6. Two patients died of cardiac failure without evidence of disease. Thus, 46 patients (50%) were continuously free of disease 18 to 78 months after diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that male sex, low grade preoperative chemotherapy-induced necrosis, and nonosteoblastic histologic condition were prognostic factors predictive of recurrence, while male sex and large tumor size were prognostic factors predictive of death. These results are comparable with those reported by other centers and are superior to our previous experiences that yielded survival rates of 5% to 10%. A substantial number of patients also had the opportunity to achieve tumor removal with conservative surgery. 
Effect of caffeine on ibuprofen analgesia in postoperative oral surgery pain. Recent studies have demonstrated that caffeine acts as an analgesic adjuvant when combined with acetaminophen, aspirin, or their mixture. Our objective was to determine whether similar enhancement of analgesia could be demonstrated when caffeine is combined with ibuprofen. On a double-blind basis, a single oral dose of ibuprofen (50, 100, or 200 mg), a combination of ibuprofen, 100 mg, with caffeine, 100 mg, a combination of ibuprofen, 200 mg, with caffeine, 100 mg, or placebo was randomly assigned to 298 outpatients with postoperative pain after the surgical removal of impacted third molars. With a self-rating record, subjects rated their pain and its relief hourly for 8 hours. All active treatments were significantly superior to placebo, and the caffeine effect was significant for every measure of analgesia. Relative potency estimates indicated that the combination was 2.4 to 2.8 times as potent as ibuprofen alone. The combination also had a more rapid onset and longer duration of analgesic action. The analgesic adjuvancy of caffeine clearly extends to combinations with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than acetaminophen or aspirin. 
Reduction of myocardial infarction after emergency coronary artery bypass grafting for failed coronary angioplasty with use of a normothermic reperfusion cardioplegia protocol. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting is necessary in 2.7% to 13.5% of patients undergoing elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Myocardial infarction develops in 11% to 49% of these patients, with 18% to 46% of infarcts resulting in new Q waves. Since February 1987 a revised protocol for myocardial preservation has been used in 19 patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty. Cardioplegia is induced with a normothermic blood cardioplegic solution. Multiple maintenance doses of cold (4 degrees C) blood cardioplegic solution are then delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. Before the aortic crossclamp is removed, normothermic reperfusion cardioplegic solution is delivered through the aortic root and vein grafts. This group was compared with all patients undergoing emergency bypass grafting for failed angioplasty before February 1987. These 45 patients received cold induction of cardioplegic solution, multiple maintenance doses of cold cardioplegic solution, and no reperfusion cardioplegic solution. The prevalence of myocardial infarction in the group receiving cold cardioplegic solution was 65% versus 26% in the group receiving normothermic cardioplegic solution (p less than 0.007). Multivariate analysis identified the use of the normothermic cardioplegia protocol (p less than 0.005), nontotal occlusion of the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.03), and presence of collateral flow to the angioplasty vessel (p less than 0.04) as being independently associated with absence of myocardial infarction. 
A prospective study of hospitalization with gallstone disease among women: role of dietary factors, fasting period, and dieting. BACKGROUND: Dietary risk factors for the development of gallstones have not been clearly established. We analyzed data from a population-based prospective study to determine dietary risk factors for hospitalization with gallstone disease. METHODS: We evaluated the role of dietary constituents, fasting, and dieting on subsequent hospitalization with gallstone disease among 4,730 women, ages 25 to 74 years, who participated in the first follow-up of the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Baseline dietary variables were established through a 24-hour dietary recall and a medical history. Proportional hazards models were used to calculate the effects of dietary variables while controlling for baseline risk factors. RESULTS: After an average of 10 years follow-up, gallstone disease was confirmed by hospital records among 216 women who denied gallstone disease at the baseline examination. The hazard rate of hospitalization with gallstone disease increased with increasing overnight fasting period and with dieting. Intake of fiber showed a small protective effect. The effect of energy intake was significant only among women younger than age 50 years at baseline. Results were not affected by adjustment for known risk factors for gallstone disease or other dietary factors. CONCLUSION: A long overnight fasting period, dieting, and low fiber intake may increase the risk of hospitalization with gallstone disease. 
Helicobacter pylori in children with peptic ulcer and their families. Little is known about the source and spread of Helicobacter pylori, but transmission from infected family contacts has been suggested. We have therefore investigated 15 children with peptic ulcer and their first-degree relatives for H. pylori. Serum anti-H. pylori IgG, pepsinogen I, and gastrin levels were measured. Endoscopy was carried out on the children and relatives, and biopsies were taken from the gastric antrum for histology, microbiology, and urease testing. Six of 11 children with duodenal ulcer (55%) and two of four children with gastric ulcer (50%) were positive for H. pylori. Fourteen of 16 parents (87%) and eight of 13 siblings (61%) of H. pylori-positive children with peptic ulcer were also infected compared with eight of 14 parents (57%) and none of four siblings of H. pylori-negative children with peptic ulcer (P less than 0.10, greater than 0.05, and NS, respectively). The children with H. pylori-negative peptic ulcer and negative siblings combined were younger than positive children with peptic ulcer and positive siblings (P less than 0.001). The reliability of serum anti-H. pylori IgG level as a screening test for infection was confirmed. These findings call into question a pathogenetic role for H. pylori in some childhood peptic ulceration, but do suggest that person-to-person spread of infection occurs. 
Does body posture affect the incidence and mechanism of gastro-oesophageal reflux? We studied eight patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease to compare the frequency and mechanism of reflux in the upright and supine positions. Simultaneous oesophageal manometry and pH studies were performed on two separate days in each subject in the fasting and postprandial periods. The frequency of reflux tended to be higher in the upright position. The most prevalent mechanism of reflux in either position was transient relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. The frequency of transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation was higher in the upright than in the supine position. There was no difference in the total reflux time, acid clearance time, and number of reflux episodes lasting longer than five minutes in the two positions. We suggest that daytime reflux (upright) may be as important as night time (supine) reflux in the pathogenesis of reflux oesophagitis and needs to be considered when treating patients with reflux disease. 
Association between infection with Helicobacter pylori and risk of gastric cancer: evidence from a prospective investigation. OBJECTIVE--To investigate the association between gastric cancer and prior infection with Helicobacter pylori. DESIGN--Case-control comparison of prevalence of IgG antibodies to H pylori in blood samples collected prospectively, before diagnosis of gastric cancer in the cases. Presence of H pylori antibody (greater than 10 micrograms IgG/ml) determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). SUBJECTS--29 men with a subsequent diagnosis of gastric cancer and 116 aged matched controls selected from over 22,000 middle aged men participating in two ongoing cohort studies (the British United Provident Association study and the Caerphilly collaborative heart disease study), who had provided blood samples during 1975-1982. RESULTS--20 of the 29 cases (69%) and 54 of the 116 controls (47%) were positive for H pylori specific antibody. The median specific IgG concentration was significantly higher in the cases than controls (90 micrograms/ml v 3.6 micrograms/ml, p less than 0.01). The estimated odds ratio for the risk of gastric cancer in those with a history of infection with H pylori was 2.77 (95% confidence interval 1.04 to 7.97, 2p = 0.039). CONCLUSIONS--H pylori infection may be an important cause of gastric cancer; between 35% and 55% of all cases may be associated with such an infection. 
Temporal profiles of urinary excretion of NH2-terminal big gastrin immunoreactivity in humans. We studied the temporal profile of urinary NH2-terminal big gastrin immunoreactivity (NT G-34-IR) excretion in order to evaluate the dynamics of gastrin secretion. The temporal profile of urinary NT G-34-IR excretion in normal subjects represented three peaks corresponding to each meal. In contrast, the profile in antrectomized patients and patients under total parenteral nutrition (TPN) represented a flat pattern. Urinary NT G-34-IR excretions during fasting 2-h periods in antrectomized patients and TPN patients were about one-sixth and one-third, respectively, of basal NT G-34-IR excretion in normal subjects (53.1 +/- 13.9 pmol/h). Total urinary NT G-34-IR excretion during 24 h both in antrectomized patients (220 +/- 35 pmol/24 h) and TPN patients (390 +/- 68 pmol/24 h) was also significantly lower than in normal subjects (1985 +/- 403 pmol/24 h). The present study showed that the main source of urinary NT G-34-IR is the gastric antrum, that the main factor fluctuating its excretion is food intake, and that long-term TPN reduces basal gastrin secretion. Urinary NT G-34-IR would be a useful indicator for total gastrin secretion. 
Myringoplasty in children. This series examines the results of myringoplasty in children using the overlay technique. Controversy still surrounds the issue of proper timing of surgery on the basis of preoperative assessment of tubal function. Results of this technique in children, using contralateral ear status as the primary predictor of success, found an overall success rate of 78%. Age appears to be a significant factor because children 10 years old and younger were found to have a higher incidence of surgical failures. 
Evolution of technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT and brain mapping in a patient presenting with echolalia and palilalia. A 78-yr-old woman presented with transient echolalia and palilalia. She had suffered from Parkinson's disease for 2 yr. Routine laboratory examination showed hypotonic hyponatremia, but was otherwise unremarkable. Brain mapping revealed a bifrontal delta focus, more pronounced on the right. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain with technetium-99m labeled d,l hexamethylpropylene-amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO), performed during the acute episode showed relative frontoparietal hypoactivity. Brain mapping performed after disappearance of the echolalia and palilalia, which persisted only for 1 day, was normal. By contrast, SPECT findings persisted for more than 3 wk. Features of particular interest in the presented patient are the extensive defects seen on brain SPECT despite the absence of morphologic lesions, the congruent electrophysiologic changes and their temporal relationship with the clinical evolution. 
Atrial natriuretic polypeptide inhibits hypertrophy of vascular smooth muscle cells. Vascular remodeling is central to the pathophysiology of hypertension and atherosclerosis. Recent evidence suggests that vasoconstrictive substances, such as angiotensin II (AII), may function as a vascular smooth muscle growth promoting substance. To explore the role of the counterregulatory hormone, atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in this process, we examined the effect of ANP (alpha-rat ANP [1-28]) on the growth characteristics of cultured rat aortic smooth muscle (RASM) cells. ANP (10(-7) M) significantly suppressed the proliferative effect of 1% and 5% serum as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation and cell number, confirming ANP as an antimitogenic factor. In quiescent RASM cells, ANP (10(-7), 10(-6) M) significantly suppressed the basal incorporations of 3H-uridine and leucine by 50 and 30%, respectively. ANP (10(-7), 10(-6) M) also suppressed AII-induced RNA and protein syntheses (by 30-40%) with the concomitant reduction of the cell size. Furthermore, ANP also significantly attenuated the increase of 3H-uridine and leucine incorporations caused by transforming growth factor-beta (4 x 10(-11), 4 x 10(-10) M), a potent hypertrophic factor. These results indicate that ANP possesses an antihypertrophic action on vascular smooth muscle cells. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by 24-h treatment with phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate did not inhibit ANP-induced suppression on 3H-uridine incorporation. Based on the observation that ANP was more potent than a ring-deleted analogue of ANP on inhibiting 3H-uridine incorporation, we conclude that the ANP's inhibitory effect is primarily mediated via the activation of a guanylate cyclase-linked ANP receptor(s). Indeed 8-bromo cGMP mimicked the antihypertrophic action of ANP. Accordingly, we speculate that in addition to its vasorelaxant and natriuretic effects, the antihypertrophic action of ANP observed in the present study may serve as an additional compensatory mechanism of ANP in hypertension. 
Combination chemotherapy for advanced adenocarcinoma of the cervix. A patient with advanced adenocarcinoma of the cervix was treated only with cisplatin and mitomycin C (MMC). The regimen achieved a complete response, confirmed by chest radiograph and computed axial tomography scan, lasting 50 months. The patient is alive with recurrent disease 59 months after diagnosis. No severe drug-related toxicity occurred. 
Carotid endarterectomy in elderly patients Between 1971 and 1989, 749 carotid endarterectomies were performed at our institution for symptomatic carotid occlusive disease in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these procedures, 693 were done in patients 71 through 80 years of age, and 56 were done in patients between the ages of 81 and 90 years. The neurologic morbidity and perioperative mortality in the former group were 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, whereas in the latter group the corresponding values were 5.4% and 0%, respectively. For the entire group, the neurologic morbidity was 3.1% and the mortality was 1.3%. Of the 23 new postoperative neurologic deficits, 19 (83%) occurred in high-risk patients with severe preoperative neurologic or medical risks, and 14 (61%) of these deficits were minor. In selected elderly patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusive disease, endarterectomy seems to be a safe procedure that is associated with acceptably low perioperative morbidity and mortality. 
Routine programmed electrical stimulation in survivors of acute myocardial infarction for prediction of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up: results, optimal stimulation protocol and cost-effective screening Of 3,286 consecutive patients treated for acute myocardial infarction, electrophysiologic testing was performed in 1,209 survivors (37%) free of significant complications at the time of hospital discharge to determine their risk of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up. Sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia was inducible by programmed electrical stimulation in 75 (6.2%). Antiarrhythmic therapy was not routinely prescribed regardless of the test results. During the 1st year of follow-up, 14 infarct survivors (19%) with inducible ventricular tachycardia experienced spontaneous ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation in the absence of new ischemia compared with 34 (2.9%) of those without inducible ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.0005). During the extended follow-up period (median 28 months) of those with inducible ventricular tachycardia, 19 (25%) had a spontaneous electrical event; 37% of these first events were fatal. These results suggest that the most cost-effective strategy for predicting arrhythmia will be obtained by restricting electrophysiologic testing to infarct survivors whose left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 40% and using a stimulation protocol containing four extrastimuli. Electrophysiologic testing is the single best predictor of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias during follow-up in infarct survivors. The majority (94%) with a negative test benefit from the more reliable reassurance that all is well, whereas the 25% risk of electrical events in those with inducible ventricular tachycardia justifies a prospective trial of effective prophylactic antiarrhythmic interventions. 
Omega-3 fatty acids in health and disease and in growth and development. Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans. Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Abdominal wall tenderness: a useful sign in chronic abdominal pain. The outcome in 72 patients with obscure abdominal pain and a positive Carnett's (abdominal wall tenderness) test, seen in one firm's surgical outpatient clinic between 1975 and 1983, was sought by a combination of hospital note retrieval and general practitioner questionnaire. Full follow-up data to date or death were available for 58 (81 per cent) patients and partial follow-up for 14 patients. The study showed that the patients generated a good deal of investigation and a number of surgical procedures but that seldom were their symptoms attributable to serious pathology. Familiarity with the test, taken in the context of a proper history and examination, has been found helpful in assessing such patients and saves the inconvenience, expense and occasional hazard of investigation, and even surgery. 
Characteristics of cirrhosis undiagnosed during life: a comparative analysis of 73 undiagnosed cases and 149 diagnosed cases of cirrhosis, detected in 4929 consecutive autopsies. In 4929 consecutive autopsies performed during a period of 4 years, 222 cases (4.5%) of cirrhosis were found, of which 149 (3%) were detected while the patients were alive (diagnosed cirrhosis) and 73 (1.5%) were not detected while the patients were living (undiagnosed cirrhosis). Fifty-three of the 73 undiagnosed patients appeared to be completely without signs of cirrhosis (silent cirrhosis). In the diagnosed group, 70% of patients died from hepatic causes, in contrast to 16% in the undiagnosed group. At autopsy, the following complications of cirrhosis were found more frequently in the diagnosed group than in the undiagnosed group: ascites (41% vs. 8%), oesophageal varices (44% vs. 10%), splenomegaly (52% vs. 29%). The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma did not differ significantly in the two groups (12% vs. 8%). It is concluded that cirrhosis without obvious signs occurs relatively frequently, and that no sensitive non-invasive screening methods are available at present. 
Cerebrovascular accident complicating acute myocardial infarction: incidence, clinical significance and short- and long-term mortality rates. The SPRINT Study Group. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report the incidence, the antecedents, and the clinical significance of clinically recognized cerebrovascular accidents or transient ischemic attacks (CVA-TIA) complicating acute myocardial infarction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During 1981 to 1983, a secondary prevention study with nifedipine (SPRINT) was conducted in 14 hospitals in Israel among 2,276 survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the study, demographic, historical, and medical data were collected on special forms for all patients with diagnosed acute myocardial infarction in 13 of these 14 hospitals (the SPRINT registry, n = 5,839). Mortality follow-up was completed for 99% of hospital survivors for a mean follow-up of 5.5 years (range: 4.5 to 7 years). RESULTS: The incidence of CVA-TIA was 0.9% (54 of 5,839). The latter rate increased significantly only with age, from 0.4% among patients up to 59 years old to 1.6% among those aged greater than or equal to 70 years. Multivariate analysis identified age, congestive heart failure, and history of stroke as predictors of CVA-TIA during the acute phase of myocardial infarction. Patients with CVA-TIA exhibited a complicated hospital course, with a 15-day mortality rate of 41%. Subsequent mortality rates in survivors at 1 and 5 years were 34% and 59%, respectively. Rates at the same time points in patients without CVA-TIA were 16%, 11%, and 29% (p less than 0.01). In a multivariate analysis that included age, gender, congestive heart failure, history of previous myocardial infarction, and hypertension, CVA-TIA was independently associated with increased 15-day mortality (covariate-adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.62; 90% confidence interval [CI], 1.59 to 4.32), as well as subsequent 1-year (OR = 3.29; 90% CI, 1.70 to 6.36) and long-term (mean follow-up = 5.5 years) mortality (OR = 2.46; 90% CI, 1.30 to 4.69). CONCLUSION: In this large cohort of consecutive patients with myocardial infarction, CVA-TIA was a relatively infrequent complication of acute myocardial infarction. Factors independently favoring the occurrence of CVA-TIA were old age, previous CVA, and congestive heart failure. CVA-TIA occurring during acute myocardial infarction independently increased the risk of early death threefold as well as the risk of long-term mortality in early-phase survivors. (2.5-fold). 
The inheritance of alcohol consumption patterns in a general population twin sample: I. Multidimensional scaling of quantity/frequency data. Quantity/frequency data on alcohol consumption were obtained by mailed questionnaire from 2,903 same-sex monozygotic and dizygotic Australian twin pairs. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling was applied to these data. A three-dimensional solution was required to account for the observed pattern of twin concordances for alcohol consumption. These results suggest separate determination of abstinence, frequency of consumption and quantity consumed when drinking, rather than inheritance of a single continuum of overall consumption level. 
In-flight esophageal variceal bleeding en route for liver transplantation: a case report and review of the literature. Esophageal variceal bleeding owing to portal hypertension is a potential threat in pediatric patients awaiting liver transplantation. We report a case of a three-year-old boy with severe congenital hepatic fibrosis, Caroli's disease, and portal hypertension who developed a life-threatening variceal hemorrhage for the first time in his life during commercial air transport to a liver transplantation center. Factors precipitating variceal bleeding are discussed, particularly those resulting from changes in altitude. It is recommended that prophylactic treatment for variceal bleeding be at least considered in children awaiting liver transplantation prior to prolonged air transportation. Because of differences in capabilities of treatment providers in various locales, and because there are as yet no conclusive data, the treatment of choice must be decided on an individual basis. Equipment for treating in-flight hemorrhage should be available. 
Leiomyosarcoma of the trachea. Case report. Leiomyosarcoma of the trachea is a rare primary tumor of the upper airway. Twelve cases have been reported in the English-language literature. Our experience with a patient with leiomyosarcoma of the cervical trachea is presented. The classic symptoms, diagnosis, and surgical management of this case are contrasted with those of the previously reported cases. The surgical technique used for our patient, primary tumor resection with skin grafting and placement of a Montgomery Laryngeal Stent, is a unique and effective treatment. 
Midterm follow-up of young patients fused in situ for spondylolisthesis. To evaluate the results of posterolateral fusion alone (66 patients) and combined posterolateral and anterior fusion (39 patients) in situ, 105 consecutive patients younger than 25 years of age with spondylolisthesis, retrospectively were examined clinically and radiologically. The follow-up rate was 98% after a mean of 8.2 years (range, 2.0-15.3). Pre- and postoperative progression of slip was rare (6% and 1%, respectively), and no prognostic factors were found. The definite pseudarthrosis rate was 6%. In patients with low- and high-grade slip, 67% and 88% (respectively) were satisfied at follow-up, suggesting that the indication for operative treatment in patients with low-grade slip is relative. 
Radioimmunoassay of insulin-like growth factors in cyst fluid of central nervous system tumors. Tumor cells are characterized by abnormalities in growth and metabolism, including the autocrine secretion of certain growth factors. The authors have previously shown the presence of insulin-like growth factor receptors in tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and in this study examine whether CNS tumors are capable of autocrine secretion of insulin-like growth factors in situ. To investigate the production of insulin-like growth factors I and II by CNS tumors, the authors have developed specific radioimmunoassays for these growth factors. In situ production of insulin-like growth factors was studied by immunoassay of CNS tumor cyst fluid aspirated at the time of surgery from 12 cystic tumors: seven primary brain tumors, four metastatic tumors, and one spinal schwannoma. For immunoassay, cyst fluid was treated overnight with acetic acid, then insulin-like growth factors were separated from binding proteins by a refined solid-phase technique, then dried and reconstituted in immunoassay buffer. Normal human serum and cerebrospinal fluid served as controls. Insulin-like growth factor I was detected in all 12 tumors studied. In contrast, insulin-like growth factor II was detected only in three low-grade astrocytomas, the spinal schwannoma (which had the highest insulin-like growth factor II level of all tumors studied), and three metastatic lung cancers. These results suggest that CNS tumors may be capable of autocrine production of insulin-like growth factors in situ. Furthermore, there appears to be a difference in the type of insulin-like growth factors produced by different types of CNS tumors. Preferential production of insulin-like growth factors may be an important marker of tumor differentiation and useful as a diagnostic tool. 
Cardiac angiosarcoma with ruptured right atrium diagnosed by echocardiography. A 41-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of right-sided chest pain. Two-dimensional echocardiographic examination revealed a ruptured right atrium and a localized pericardial effusion. Color Doppler echocardiography and contrast echocardiography showed blood flow from the right atrium into pericardial effusion, which was confirmed at emergency surgery. The pathologic specimen from the right atrium showed a spindle cell angiosarcoma. 
Experimental hepatocellular carcinoma: MR receptor imaging. Relaxation time measurements and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed in three different animal models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). After intravenous administration of asialoglycoprotein-directed arabinogalactan-stabilized ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (10 mumol Fe/kg receptor agent), T2 of normal liver decreased from 41.6 msec +/- 1.0 to 19.4 msec +/- 1.7 (P less than .05) in rats. T2 of HCC implanted in normal liver or liver with chronic hepatitis was essentially unchanged. These results were similar to those obtained by administration of a reticuloendothelial cell-directed conventional iron oxide; however, the required dose of receptor agent was lower. MR imaging in a woodchuck model of virally induced HCC confirmed the distribution of the hepatocyte-directed agent to regions of functioning and differentiated hepatocytes but not to malignant tumor tissue. The results suggest that MR receptor imaging may play a role in the differentiation between primary liver tumor and functional liver tissue such as that in normal liver hepatitis or regenerating nodules. 
Histology of aural polyp as a predictor of middle ear disease activity. This study compares the histology of aural polyp with the subsequent clinical course of the middle ear disease. All cases of aural polyps that presented to the department during 1988 and 1989 were included. Patients who had previous ear surgery were excluded as were cases where the operation was part of clearance of known cholesteatoma rather than polypectomy alone. We found that the histology of the aural polyp was not a precise predictor of the presence or absence of cholesteatoma, nor of the subsequent course of the middle ear disease. 
Effect of dialysis membrane and patient's age on signs of dialysis-related amyloidosis. The Working Party on Dialysis Amyloidosis. This 12 center study was designed to assess factors affecting the development and progression of beta 2-microglobulin amyloidosis in long-term dialysis. A total of 221 patients who were on hemodialysis for more than five years, and who were treated the entire time only with AN69, a biocompatible, highly permeable membrane, or cuprophane, a less permeable, poorly biocompatible membrane (Cell) were evaluated for time on dialysis, development of carpal tunnel syndrome, and cystic bone lesions. X-ray documentation was taken in a minimum of four of the six following joints: both hips, wrists and shoulders. The data demonstrate that patients treated solely by AN69 membranes display signs of bone amyloidosis less frequently than do those treated by Cell membranes. Age at onset of dialysis was found to have a striking correlation with the development of carpal tunnel syndrome and bone amyloidosis, while no significant influence was found for hyperparathyroidism, sex or year of first dialysis. 
Color Doppler sonography in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction: patterns of temporal response to papaverine. Most studies of duplex Doppler sonography for the assessment of erectile dysfunction involve determination of peak systolic velocities 5 min after intracavernosal injection of papaverine. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of the timing of Doppler measurements of flow after papaverine injection for establishing the presence of arterial and venous abnormalities. Color Doppler sonography was performed in 75 patients for evaluation of vasculogenic impotence. After intracavernosal injection of 60 mg of papaverine, measurements of peak systolic and end-diastolic velocities were obtained in each cavernosal artery at 5-min intervals for a total of 30 min. A peak systolic velocity of less than 25 cm/sec was used as the threshold for arterial insufficiency. An end-diastolic velocity of greater than 5 cm/sec was used to predict venous incompetence. Scanning was performed for direct assessment of dorsal venous flow. Thirty patients were subsequently evaluated by cavernosometry and cavernosography. In most patients (76%), maximum response to papaverine was achieved within the first 5 min. In eight patients, significant increases in systolic velocity were seen only after 5 min. In 10 patients, significant changes in end-diastolic velocity between 5 and 30 min resulted in diagnostic reclassification. Data acquisition for 30 min significantly improved the sensitivity (95%) and specificity (83%) for the prediction of venous incompetence in patients with correlative cavernosography. Transient, early dorsal vein flow was noted in normal subjects. Persistent dorsal vein flow had an 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity for venous incompetence. Our results suggest that, when using color Doppler sonography, gathering data for 30 min may improve the prediction of vasculogenic impotence.
