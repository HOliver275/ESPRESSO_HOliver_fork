1	Treatment of malignant pleural effusions with doxorubicin hydrochloride-containing poly(L-lactic acid) microspheres. For the treatment of malignant pleural effusions, we prepared doxorubicin hydrochloride (Adriamycin)-containing poly(L-lactic acid) microspheres (ADR-MS). In vitro, 50 percent and 100 percent release times of ADR from ADR-MS were 6.3 and 20 days, respectively. After intrapleural administration of ADR-MS for seven patients at an ADR dose of 40 mg, ADR was detected in the effusions for more than two weeks; however, ADR concentrations in serum were very small, consistent with minimal transpleural absorption of ADR. These results indicated the slow release of ADR into the pleural cavity. Furthermore, the amount of drained ADR was less than a few percent of the administered dose. In some cases, malignant cells in the effusion disappeared after the treatment. No complications related to the procedure occurred, and the patients developed no systemic symptoms. One patient died after four months, and the other six patients are alive after 21 to 31 months without reaccumulation of the effusion. The local administration of ADR-MS produces a localized high and systemic low concentration of ADR, which could potentially improve the patient's quality of life. 
1	Effects of tamoxifen and somatostatin analogue on growth of human medullary, follicular, and papillary thyroid carcinoma cell lines: tissue culture and nude mouse xenograft studies. The knowledge that (1) the normal thyroid contains somatostatin, (2) polypeptide growth factors influence thyroid cell function, and (3) thyroid cells contain steroid hormone receptors prompted us to add somatostatin analogue No. 201-995 (SMS) (5 ng/ml) and/or tamoxifen citrate (TAM) (5 mumol/L) to 7-day monolayer cultures (50,000 cells/well) of three separate human thyroid carcinoma cell lines: DR081 (medullary), WR082 (follicular), and NPA'87 (papillary). Results, tabulated as cell numbers/well (X10(5) on day 7, revealed that TAM inhibited growth of medullary and follicular cells and that TAM plus SMS inhibited growth of papillary cells. In vivo studies of subcutaneous tumor cell xenografts in nude mice have documented that TAM (5 mg subcutaneous pellet) significantly inhibits the growth of medullary implants. Flow cytometric DNA studies of medullary cell cultures demonstrated a reduced G2 + M phase with TAM treatment. For papillary cell implants, TAM plus SMS (5 micrograms subcutaneously, twice daily) did not suppress tumor growth. All three cell lines were negative for estrogen receptor; addition of estradiol (5 ng/ml) to medullary cell cultures neither stimulated replication nor reversed the inhibitory effects of TAM in vitro. We conclude that (1) TAM slowed the growth of a cell line of human medullary carcinoma, both in vitro and in vivo; (2) this effect was not reversed by estradiol; (3) TAM plus SMS inhibited replication of a papillary carcinoma cell line in vitro, but not in vivo; and (4) TAM alone and TAM plus SMS inhibited replication of cultures of a human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line. TAM and SMS may be useful in treatment of some human thyroid carcinomas. 
4	Insulin resistance and blood pressure in young black men. Insulin resistance, independent of obesity or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, has been demonstrated to be associated with high blood pressure. To determine if insulin resistance could be an antecedent to hypertension in a high-risk population, we studied normotensive (112 +/- 12/70 +/- 10 mm Hg) and borderline hypertensive (135 +/- 8/85 +/- 5 mm Hg) lean young black men (22-26 years old) with the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. All subjects had clinically normal oral glucose tolerance. Body mass index and percent adipose mass were the same in both groups. Fasting plasma insulin concentration was significantly higher in the borderline hypertensive group (p less than 0.01). Insulin-directed exogenous glucose metabolism at the same degree of steady-state hyperinsulinemia was significantly lower in the borderline hypertensive group (5.98 +/- 2.22 versus 8.22 +/- 1.96 mg/kg/min; p less than 0.01). For the total population, a significant inverse correlation existed between the glucose infusion rate and systolic blood pressure (p less than 0.01). These data indicate that there is a relation between insulin-mediated glucose uptake and blood pressure. Furthermore, in this high-risk population insulin resistance may precede the onset of established essential hypertension. 
1	Immunosuppressive acidic protein in malignant diseases. Clinical relevance? The immunosuppressive acidic protein (IAP) has been described as a tumor associated marker in some solid tumors and hematologic diseases. To define the clinical relevance the authors determined the serum IAP levels in 194 patients with malignancies before initiation of therapy, 14 patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), 28 patients with bacterial pneumonia, and 23 healthy volunteers. Immunosuppressive acidic protein was measured by radial immunodiffusion. The mean value of our controls was 405 +/- 48 micrograms/ml. This is consistent with published data. The mean values for patients with malignancies varied from 554 micrograms/ml to 698 micrograms/ml. These are only marginally higher than those observed for the controls. In contrast patients with bacterial pneumonia demonstrated significantly elevated values (1038 +/- 261 micrograms/ml). The authors conclude that IAP cannot be used as a diagnostic marker for the malignant diseases examined in this study. 
5	Artificial urinary sphincters around intestinal segments--are they safe? Artificial urinary sphincters (AUS) were implanted around intestinal segments to achieve urinary continence in 8 patients and faecal continence in 1. In 6 patients the cuff was placed around the lower end of the cystoplasty following bladder neck (5) or urethral (1) erosion. Four are completely dry, 1 on self-intermittent catheterisation (SIC). One has mild stress incontinence. In 1 patient the cuff eroded at 8 months. Two patients had cuffs implanted parastomally to create continent diversion. One is satisfactory on SIC and the other had her AUS explanted because of life-threatening metabolic acidosis. The rectal cuff was explanted because of faecal impaction above the cuff. As an absolute last resort, placing an AUS round a cystoplasty appears little more hazardous than round bladder neck. The use of the AUS for continent diversion has not been pursued because of reliable techniques of non-prosthetic continent diversion. The current model of the AUS is unsuitable for the treatment of faecal incontinence. 
4	Femorofemoral bypass: a profile of graft failure. We have reviewed our experience with 71 patients who had a femorofemoral bypass for unilateral iliac artery occlusion or stenosis. We analyzed morbidity, mortality, initial relief of symptoms, early patency, and long-term primary and secondary patency; and we attempted to identify the cause of graft failure. The overall hospital mortality after operative repair was 4%. One-year survival was 84% and 2-year survival was 81%. Early patency was 98.5% at 1 month, late patency was 91% at 1 year and 82% at 5 years. The major cause of graft failure was inadequate run-off and outflow disease progression. 
1	Isolation of a complementary DNA clone encoding an autoantigen recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. We isolated a complementary DNA clone encoding a 52-kd protein recognized by an anti-neuronal cell antibody in serum from a patient with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration associated with uterine carcinoma. The recombinant protein expressed in prokaryotic cells was specifically recognized by the anti-neuronal cell antibody from the patient, and its molecular weight was identical to that of antigenic proteins in the cerebellum. The deduced protein consisted of 450 amino acids dominated by hydrophilic residues, the calculated relative molecular mass was 51,238, and the predicted value of the isoelectric point was 4.99. This complementary DNA sequence and the deduced protein sequence have not been reported previously, and the sequences showed no homologies with the complimentary DNA or the amino acid sequences in the GenBank, EMBL, or NBRF databases, including the complementary DNA for a 34-kd cerebellar protein (CDR34) that is recognized by an anti-Purkinje cell antibody. Unexpectedly, the transcript of this gene was detected not only in the cerebellum and the brain stem but also in an extraneural tissue, the intestine. 
5	Determination of ventricular fluid outflow resistance in patients with ventriculomegaly. Resorption of the ventricular fluid was studied by measuring ventricular fluid outflow resistance during steady state 1.5 and 5.0 ml/min infusions in 26 patients with substantial enlargement of the supratentorial ventricular system. This test may avoid unnecessary use of shunts, but a shunt could be introduced during the same procedure. 
1	The management of primary fallopian tube carcinoma. The outcome of 30 patients with primary fallopian tube carcinoma is described. Treatment varied over the 22 year period of accrual and included combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. There was an apparent increase in stage at treatment with time which was probably related to more precise staging at laparotomy and the greater use of computerized tomography. The median survival for all patients was 28 months and the 5-year survival was 18%. Ten patients received postoperative chemotherapy for residual disease with an overall response rate of 80% and median progression-free and overall survival times of 14 and 21 months respectively. The pattern of relapse was similar to that seen in ovarian carcinoma, with all but one patient having the pelvis or abdomen as the main site of recurrence. Primary fallopian tube carcinoma has a response to treatment and a tumour biology similar to that of ovarian carcinoma. It is recommended that the management of this uncommon malignancy should continue to be along the lines of ovarian carcinoma, with initial treatment by cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy for residual disease. 
4	Hemopump support for the failing heart. Under fluoroscopy, the hemopump is passed through the aortic valve into the left ventricle through a Gortex (WF Gore, Denver, CO) chimney sewn to a surgically exposed femoral artery. The system aspirates the left ventricular blood and actively pumps it into the aorta. Five patients (four men, one woman), aged 47-71 years (mean, 62 years), were candidates for hemopump support because of refractory cardiogenic shock. Three were recovering from repeated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and two required postoperative emergency CABG for failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). One patient died during insertion, and four had the hemo-pump successfully placed. All patients had low cardiac out-put and had intraaortic balloons in place. Average insertion time took 20 min, with maintenance on the hemopump for an average of 13 hr. One patient was maintained on the hemopump for 12 hr, but because of continued deterioration, was placed on a total artificial heart (Harvik 7-70). Patients 3 (hemopump inserted transthoracically) and 4 had the hemopump discontinued because of brain death, and the fifth survived. This patient is alive and working 1 yr later. The hemopump is an effective left ventricular support system that is less invasive than conventional transthoracic systems. 
4	Transesophageal echocardiography in evaluation and management after a Fontan procedure. Transesophageal echocardiography was used in 18 patients (aged 1.6 to 34 years, mean age 12.6) to assess the immediate (5 patients) or intermediate (13 patients) results after a Fontan-type procedure. The findings were correlated with precordial echocardiographic (all patients) and cardiac catheterization (11 patients) data. Atrial shunting was documented by transesophageal studies in three patients (precordial in one patient). In two patients it was confirmed by cardiac catheterization; the third underwent reoperation based on the transesophageal study alone. Pulmonary artery obstruction was documented in three patients (precordial in one patient) and was confirmed by subsequent cardiac catheterization in all. Evaluation of anterior Fontan connections was successful in 5 of 8 patients (precordial in 6 of 8), and posterior connections in 10 of 10 patients (precordial in 5 of 10). A Glenn shunt could be evaluated in eight of nine patients (precordial in three of nine). Thrombus formation was detected by transesophageal studies in three patients (precordial in one patient); repeat studies were used to evaluate thrombolytic therapy in two. Atrioventricular valvular regurgitation (11 of 18 patients) was better defined by transesophageal than by precordial studies (5 of 18). A coronary artery fistula was identified in two cases (precordial in none). Transesophageal pulsed Doppler interrogation of pulmonary artery and pulmonary vein flow patterns consistently allowed a detailed evaluation of the Fontan circulation. Transesophageal echocardiography is an important diagnostic and monitoring technique after the Fontan procedure. In this series, it was far superior to precordial ultrasound evaluation and of substantial additional value to cardiac catheterization. 
5	Antinuclear antibodies in sera of patients with recurrent pregnancy wastage. Four groups of women were studied to determine whether low-level antinuclear antibody titers are associated with a higher risk for pregnancy loss. Group A consisted of 30 patients with a history of unexplained fetal losses. Group B consisted of 30 women with "explained" fetal losses (e.g., uterine septum or luteal phase defect). Ages and number of losses were comparable between the women in groups A and B. Group C consisted of 61 healthy pregnant women. Group D involved 61 healthy nonpregnant women of reproductive age. In groups A and B, 40% and 53.3% of the respective patients had antinuclear antibody titers greater than or equal to 1:40. In groups C and D the frequencies of positive antinuclear antibody titers were 8.2% and 5.6%, respectively. This study demonstrates a high prevalence of low-titer antinuclear antibody-positive serum in patients with explained and unexplained pregnancy losses. 
5	Treatment of hepatolithiasis: improvement of result by a systematic approach. In previous decades the result of treatment of hepatolithiasis has been unsatisfactory. The incidence of residual stones after surgery might reach 77%. In the past 6 years we adopted a systematic approach comprised of accurate delineation of disease in the liver and biliary tract by direct cholangiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography; tailored surgical treatment according to the extent of involvement of the liver and biliary tract; access to the intrahepatic ducts through the left duct or round ligament approach when there was difficulty with common bile duct exposure; routine use of flexible choledochoscopy; and application of electrohydraulic lithotripsy for large and impacted stones. Complete stone clearance was achieved in 114 of 127 patients (89.8%). Of those patients who had incomplete stone clearance, only six cases (4.7%) were related to technical failure of postoperative choledochoscopy. The incidence of stone recurrence was 15.8%, the lowest rate so far reported. It was the same regardless of whether a biliary drainage procedure had been performed, but the treatment for recurrent stones was facilitated by previous hepaticocutaneous jejunostomy. Overall the surgical treatment required for stone recurrence was of a lesser magnitude than that in the past. 
1	Discordant bone marrow involvement in diffuse large-cell lymphoma: a distinct clinical-pathologic entity associated with a continuous risk of relapse. From 1975 to 1988, 50 patients with lymph node biopsy-documented diffuse large-cell lymphoma (DLCL) presented with bone marrow involvement. Twenty-four patients (48%) had large-cell lymphoma (LCL) in the bone marrow and were compared with 19 (38%) patients who had small cleaved-cell lymphoma (SCCL) in the marrow. Additionally, seven patients (14%) had mixed small- and large-cell lymphoma (ML) in the marrow. Patients who had LCL marrow involvement were younger (P less than .02) and more frequently had elevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (P less than .001), high tumor burden (P less than .01), and more sites of extranodal disease (P less than .05) than those with SCCL in the marrow. The complete response (CR) rate to multiagent chemotherapy was 16.7% in the LCL group and 89.4% in the SCCL group (P less than .001). One third of the patients with LCL in the marrow developed CNS involvement, compared with only one patient in the SCCL group (P = .06). Overall 5-year survival was 79% in patients with SCCL marrow involvement, compared with only 12% in patients with LCL in the marrow (P = .002). Despite a high CR rate, patients with marrow involved by SCCL were at a high continuous risk of relapse with only a 30% failure-free survival at 5 years. We conclude that bone marrow involvement with LCL predicts for extremely poor prognosis with low response rate and short survival. Patients with SCCL in the bone marrow have a high rate of CR and a high rate of 5-year survival; however, there is a high risk of late relapse, and only 15% are in a continuous remission at 8 years. 
5	Bleeding complications associated with cardiopulmonary bypass. Bleeding after CPB has been difficult to characterize and its treatment equally difficult to standardize. The complexity of this problem is related to the hemostatic process, the technical variations in the operative procedures, and the many uncontrolled variables associated with CPB, including the effects of anesthetic or pharmacologic agents, the nature of the priming solution, hemodilution, hypothermia, the type of oxygenator, and the use of transfused blood products. Although there are multiple and generally predictable complex changes in the hemostatic mechanism during CPB, the temporary loss of platelet function is the most common and clinically relevant. This transient platelet dysfunction occurs in all patients undergoing CPB; however, it only causes excessive bleeding in a small percentage of patients. Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible to predict which patients will develop hemorrhagic complications, although prolonged pump times are a contributing risk factor. Over the past decade there has been extensive investigation into the management of bleeding associated with CPB, provoked primarily by the increased awareness of transfusion-transmitted viral diseases and the inappropriately excessive use of homologous blood products. Several approaches to autotransfusion of shed blood and autologus blood donation have been developed to minimize perioperative homologous blood transfusion. Pharmacologic agents such as desmopressin, aprotinin, and topical fibrin glues have also been introduced to improve hemostasis during CPB. The protease inhibitor aprotinin is particularly promising in the reduction of bleeding associated with CPB when given prophylactically. Aprotinin may provide new insights into the mechanism of CPB-induced platelet dysfunction. Desmopressin is indicated only for the treatment of bleeding after CPB. The management of bleeding associated with CPB will undoubtedly. 
5	Detection of anti-Epstein-Barr virus trans-activator (ZEBRA) antibodies in sera from patients with human immunodeficiency virus. Patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex often show symptoms of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation. Several EBV-encoded trans-acting factors activate the EBV lytic cycle, and one, ZEBRA (BamHI Z EBV replication activator; also called EB1), switches EBV from its latent to productive cycle. Indirect immunofluorescence studies were done using human cells transfected with a recombinant DNA-harboring cDNA sequence spanning BZLF1 (BamHI Z left frame 1) that was inserted downstream of the adenovirus major late promoter. IgG anti-ZEBRA antibodies were detected in a high proportion of asymptomatic HIV carriers and in AIDS patients but were absent in healthy control individuals. The presence of anti-ZEBRA antibodies in the sera of HIV-positive patients favors the hypothesis that EBV reactivates in such subjects. This finding may be of practical importance in the prognostication of AIDS development. 
2	Electrophysiology of motor pathways for sphincter control in multiple sclerosis. The central and peripheral motor pathways serving striated sphincter muscle function were studied using cortical and lumbar transcutaneous electrical stimulation, pudendal nerve stimulation and sphincter electromyography in 23 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and sphincter disturbance, including incontinence of urine or faeces, urinary voiding dysfunction, or constipation. The central motor conduction time was significantly increased in the MS group compared to controls (p less than 0.05). Damage to both the upper and lower motor neuron pathways can contribute to sphincter disturbance in MS. The latter may be due to coexisting pathology or to involvement of the conus medullaris by MS. 
3	Chronic headache associated with a functioning shunt: usefulness of pressure monitoring. Chronic headaches in a shunt-dependent patient with small ventricles has long been treated with little or no regard to intracranial pressure. In this study, pressure monitoring on 12 such patients demonstrated that they fell into three distinct categories: 3 had headaches caused by intracranial hypertension, 2 had headaches from hypotension, and 7 showed no relation of symptoms to pressure. As therapeutic procedures for treating these three categories are entirely different and sometimes opposing, it is clear that intracranial pressure monitoring is essential to successful management of this complaint. 
5	Activated protooncogenes in human lung tumors from smokers. Fourteen primary human lung tumor DNAs from smokers were analyzed for transforming activity by two DNA transfection assays. Activated protooncogenes were detected in 3 of 11 tumor DNAs by the NIH 3T3 focus assay, whereas activated protooncogenes were detected in 11 of 13 tumor DNAs by the NIH 3T3 cotransfection-nude mouse tumorigenicity assay. K- or NRAS genes activated by point mutation at codons 12 or 61 were detected in a large cell carcinoma, a squamous cell carcinoma, and 5 adenocarcinomas. An HRAS oncogene activated by a different mechanism was detected in an epidermoid carcinoma. One adenocarcinoma was found to contain an activated RAF gene. Two unidentified transforming genes were detected in a squamous cell carcinoma DNA and two adenocarcinoma DNAs. Eight of 10 lung adenocarcinomas that had formed metastases at the time of surgery were found to contain RAS oncogenes. No significant increase in metastasis was observed in the lung adenocarcinomas that contained one or more 6-kilobase EcoRI alleles of the LMYC gene. Overall, 12 of 14 (86%) of the lung tumor DNAs from smokers were found to contain activated protooncogenes. RAS oncogenes appear to play a role in the development of metastases in lung adenocarcinomas. 
2	High incidence of viral hepatitis among American missionaries in Africa. Protestant missionaries (n = 360) serving in sub-Saharan Africa between 1967-1984 were studied to determine the risk of hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Personnel were serologically screened for antibody to both the hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) and the surface antigen to the hepatitis B virus (anti-HBs) prior to departure, periodically during service abroad, and upon completion of their African tour. Rates of seroconversion were used as measures of the incidence of infection. Prior to service, 16% of the staff had anti-HAV and 3% had anti-HBs; post-service rates were 42% and 26%, respectively. Over 90% of the staff with greater than 20 years of service were seropositive for anti-HAV. For both viruses, the infection rate was highest during the first 1-2 years of service, when 28% of those susceptible to HAV and 11% of those susceptible to HBV became infected. Over the next decade, the median annual attack rate was 5.4% for HAV and 4.2% for HBV. Differences in the missionary HBV infection rate among the various African nations served tended to reflect differences in the magnitude of chronic HBV carriage among indigenous population groups. We conclude that missionaries to sub-Saharan Africa are at enhanced risk of both HAV and HBV infection, and that all should receive passive immunization with immune globulin and active immunization with hepatitis B vaccine. 
2	Glutathione disulfide formation and oxidant stress during acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in mice in vivo: the protective effect of allopurinol. Acetaminophen (500 mg/kg i.p.) induced hepatotoxicity in fasted ICR mice in vivo. Acetaminophen also caused a long-lasting 50% reduction of the hepatic ATP content, an irreversible loss of hepatic xanthine dehydrogenase activity and a transient increase of the xanthine oxidase activity. All effects occurred before parenchymal cell damage, i.e., the release of cellular enzymes. The hepatic content of GSH and GSSG was initially depleted by acetaminophen without affecting the GSSG:GSH ratio (1:200), however, during the recovery phase of the hepatic GSH levels the GSSG content increased faster than GSH, resulting in a GSSG:GSH ratio of 1:18 24 h after acetaminophen administration. The mitochondrial GSSG content increased from 2% in controls to greater than 20% in acetaminophen-treated mice. The extremely elevated tissue GSSG levels were accompanied by a 4-fold increase of the plasma GSSG concentrations but not by an enhanced biliary efflux, although hepatic GSSG formation and biliary excretion were not affected by acetaminophen. Allopurinol protected dose-dependently against acetaminophen-induced cell injury, the loss of ATP and the increase of the GSSG content in the total liver and in the mitochondrial compartment without inhibiting reactive metabolite formation. High, protective as well as low, nonprotective doses of allopurinol almost completely inhibited hepatic xanthine oxidase and dehydrogenase activity, but only high doses prevented the increase of the mitochondrial GSSG content. The data indicate a long-lasting, primarily intracellular oxidant stress during the progression phase of acetaminophen-induced cell necrosis. The protective effect of allopurinol is unlikely to involve the inhibition of reactive oxygen formation by xanthine oxidase but could be the result of its antioxidant property. 
1	Spindle and epithelioid cell nevus (Spitz nevus). Natural history following biopsy. A clinical follow-up study of 49 cases of spindle and epithelioid cell nevus is presented to address the question about the potential for local recurrence. Only 19 (39%) of the 49 lesions were initially excised en toto, and the remainder (30 cases) had positive margins; six of the latter spindle and epithelioid cell nevi were reexcised, and no evidence of a residual nevus was found in five of the six cases. There were no recurrences in the 49 patients during an average follow-up period of 5.0 years (range, 1 to 10 years). The rarity of recurrent spindle and epithelioid cell nevus would justify a conservative approach to management, with clinical follow-up alone recommended after a subtotal excision, when the pathologic diagnosis is unequivocal. 
3	Language function following anterior temporal lobectomy. The authors report the results of a prospective investigation that evaluated postoperative changes in language function after dominant (29 cases) or nondominant (35 cases) anterior temporal lobectomy for treatment of complex partial seizures. These patients received conservative resection of lateral temporal cortex but aggressive resection of medial temporal cortex. None of the patients underwent functional mapping of cortical language ability. All patients were assessed with a standardized aphasia battery (Multilingual Aphasia Examination) before and 6 months after surgery. Postoperatively, the dominant anterior temporal lobectomy group did not show any significant losses in language function compared to patients who underwent nondominant anterior temporal lobectomy. In addition, the dominant temporal lobectomy group showed significant postoperative improvement in complex receptive language comprehension compared to the nondominant group. These results suggest that patients with complex partial seizures of medial temporal lobe onset can undergo a conservative resection of lateral temporal cortex without language mapping. Such surgery carries little risk to language function and provides an excellent postoperative surgical outcome. 
1	Left ventricular fibroma: echocardiographic diagnosis and successful surgical excision in three cases. The management of three patients with left ventricular fibromas is outlined. All were asymptomatic children. Routine chest radiography suggested cardiac masses. M-mode and two-dimensional echocardiography were valuable adjuncts to conventional angiography in assessing these children. Electrocardiographic changes, present in all cases, were shown to regress postoperatively. We stress the importance of these noninvasive aids in the initial investigation and outline our operative methods of reconstruction. 
5	Reoperations on heart valve prostheses: an analysis of operative risks and late results. To evaluate risks and complications of reoperations on heart valve prostheses, we reviewed data on 183 patients who underwent reoperation because of prosthetic valve malfunction. The incremental effect of the redo procedure on hospital mortality and morbidity was studied by comparing primary and reoperative procedures and analyzing a series of possible predisposing factors. Late survival after first and second reoperations was computed, and possible determinants of late mortality were examined. Overall operative mortality was 8.7%; emergency operation (p = 0.0001), previous thromboembolism (p = 0.05), and advanced New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.031) were the independent determinants. In a series of 1,355 patients having primary or secondary isolated valve replacement, the redo procedure was a significant risk factor in the univariate analysis (p = 0.025) but not in the multivariate analysis except for the subset of patients having mitral valve replacement (p = 0.052). The postoperative course was quite complicated, as evidenced by the long mean stay in the intensive care unit (mean stay, 3.8 days; longer than 2 days for 26% of the survivors). Nevertheless, postoperative complications were not significantly greater after a redo procedure than after a primary operation. Actuarial survival at 7 years was 57.3% +/- 8%. A comparison with a nonhomogeneous series from our institution did not demonstrate significant differences. In the subset of 16 patients having a second reoperation, late survival was 37.8% +/- 16% at 2 years. Advanced New York Heart Association class (p = 0.0001), double prosthetic valve dysfunction (p = 0.003), and any indication other than primary tissue failure (p = 0.06) were determinants of late mortality. 
4	Crohn's disease and retinal vascular disease. Patients with Crohn's disease may manifest extraintestinal findings including ocular involvement. We treated two patients with Crohn's disease who manifested retinal vascular disease that may have been related to the immune nature of the underlying disease or possibly to changes in the vasculature or coagulation system. One patient had a central retinal vein occlusion and the other had retinal vasculitis involving retinal arteries and veins with an apparent branch retinal artery occlusion. Both patients were in excellent health except for Crohn's disease, which was confirmed by a biopsy specimen. In one patient, the diagnosis of retinal vasculitis preceded the clinical diagnosis of Crohn's disease, whereas for the second patient the symptomatology of the intestinal disease preceded the ocular manifestations. We suggest that inflammatory bowel disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of retinal vascular occlusive disease, especially in a young patient. 
1	Hypercalcemia with excess serum 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D in lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma. Hypercalcemia has been described in a variety of granulomatous and lymphoproliferative disorders in association with elevated serum levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. In such cases, hypercalcemia appears to be the consequence of excessive production of 1,25(OH)2D by the lymphocyte/macrophage line. The authors report a patient with lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma who developed hypercalcemia with extreme elevation in serum 1,25(OH)2D. Therapy with steroids reduced the serum calcium and 1,25(OH)2D levels to normal. Hypercalcemia has not previously been reported in lymphomatoid granulomatosis/angiocentric lymphoma. The distinctive features of this malignancy, and the derangement in the metabolism of 1,25(OH)2D in lymphoproliferative disorders in general, are discussed. 
1	Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score in patients with cerebrovascular disease and in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors. Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) activity in peripheral blood was determined in 54 patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD), 11 patients with primary brain tumor, and 23 patients with metastatic brain tumor. The LAP score of the primary brain tumor patients (155 +/- 40) was significantly higher (P less than 0.03) than the LAP score for cerebrovascular disease patients (96 +/- 87). The LAP score levels of the metastatic brain tumor patients (251 +/- 55) was significantly higher as compared with both the cerebrovascular disease (P less than 0.001) and primary brain tumor groups (P less than 0.001). The LAP score could serve as an additional, although non-specific, marker to assist in the differentiation between cerebrovascular disease and brain tumors. 
5	Effect of interleukin-1-beta on metastasis formation in different tumor systems. Experiments were done to determine the effect of interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta) on metastasis formation in different tumor systems. Intravenous administration of 1 microgram of human recombinant IL-1 beta given 1 hour before tumor cell injection augmented lung colony formation (experimental metastases) by the human A375 melanoma variants, the human HT-29M colon carcinoma, the SN12-K1 renal carcinoma in nude mice, the murine B16 melanoma variants, and the murine UV-2237M fibrosarcoma in syngeneic recipients. The same treatment did not induce lung colony formation by a human rectal carcinoma (HCC-P2988) or by a murine reticulum cell sarcoma (M5076), both of which are not metastatic to the lung. Spontaneous metastases were studied in C57BL/6 mice bearing the B16-BL6 melanoma (metastatic to the lung) in their footpad and the M5076 reticulum cell sarcoma (metastatic to the liver) subcutaneously. Daily intraperitoneal treatment with 1 microgram of IL-1 beta increased lung and liver metastases. These findings indicate that treatment of mice with IL-1 beta can increase the number of artificial or spontaneous metastases and that this effect is not limited to a single tumor type or to a specific organ. 
3	Indications for thymectomy in myasthenia gravis. Fifty-six board-certified neurologists with interest and expertise in myasthenia completed a survey of indications for thymectomy in myasthenia gravis. Thymectomy was advocated for virtually all patients with thymoma, for a variable subset of patients with generalized myasthenia without thymoma, and occasionally for selected patients with disabling ocular myasthenia. 
1	Head and neck paragangliomas: a clinicopathologic study with DNA flow cytometric analysis. A total of 11 head and neck paragangliomas were the subject of pathologic study, including histologic, immunohistochemical, and DNA flow cytometric analyses. We cannot absolutely predict aggressive clinical behavior using histologic parameters alone, but we can use such parameters to segregate patients into low-risk and high-risk groups. Several trends were observed in the current study. Tumors with higher S-phase fractions, G2/M fractions, or aneuploid cell populations tended to behave "aggressively." The presence of sustentacular cells in the primary tumors cannot be used as an absolute indicator of tumor metastatic potential, as two metastatic paragangliomas in this study contained sustentacular cells in both the primary and metastatic lesions. DNA ploidy status cannot be used as an absolute prognostic parameter as the two metastatic tumors were composed of diploid primary and metastatic lesions. The three tumors with aneuploid cell populations showed "aggressive" histologic and clinical features, but the length of the follow-up period for these cases is too limited to draw any conclusions. Although no absolute criteria can be used at present to gauge aggressiveness, close follow-up of these patients is essential, especially if pathologic findings suggest an "aggressive" course (ie, "malignant" histology, higher S-phase fractions, G2/M fractions, aneuploid cell populations, or decreased sustentacular cell density). 
2	Referral of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis for liver transplantation. All patients with primary biliary cirrhosis referred to this unit for consideration for transplantation between April 1981 and January 1989 were analysed retrospectively to assess whether disease stage at referral affects the outcome after grafting and whether greater awareness of the benefits of the procedure means that patients are now being referred at an earlier stage. Seventy of the 107 patients have been grafted, with an overall one year actuarial survival of 62%. A better prognosis at the time of referral, as assessed by both serum bilirubin concentration and a mathematically derived prognostic index, was associated with a greater probability of survival after grafting. Patients in the tertile with the best prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration at referral 84 mumol/l and estimated survival in the absence of transplantation of more than nine months) had a 78% one year actuarial survival after transplantation, whereas those in the tertile with the worst prognosis (median serum bilirubin concentration 467 mumol/l and estimated survival of less than four months) had a one year actuarial survival of only 50%. No trend towards earlier referral of patients, however, was shown using either of these two markers. This retrospective analysis suggests that many patients are being referred too late for an optimal outcome. We recommend that patients with primary biliary cirrhosis who are potential candidates for liver grafting should be referred to a transplant centre before the serum bilirubin concentration approaches 150 mumol/l. 
5	Evaluation and therapy of breakthrough bleeding in women using a triphasic oral contraceptive. This study was designed to investigate the incidence and pattern of breakthrough bleeding (BTB) in 1,259 women who were prescribed for the first time a triphasic oral contraceptive (OC, 7-7-7) and to evaluate a hypothesis of management for BTB persisting after three cycles. The new users were compared with a control group of 696 women who had used various OCs for at least 6 months. The incidence of BTB in the control group was 16.8% and in the new users was 24.9%, 17.5%, and 15.3% in the first 3 months, respectively. Breakthrough bleeding occurred late in the 7-7-7 package in 58% and early or midway through the package in 17% and 25%, respectively. We hypothesized that late-package BTB would improve if the patient was switched to a monophasic pill similar to the relatively estrogenic formulation of the beginning of the package and vice versa for early or midpackage BTB. Seventy women with BTB at 3 months were randomly given 0.5/35 or 1/35 for a further 3 months. Breakthrough bleeding was more likely (P less than 0.05) to improve in women switched to 1/35 compared with 0.5/35 regardless of where in the package BTB occurred. 
4	A risk-benefit analysis of elective bilateral oophorectomy: effect of changes in compliance with estrogen therapy on outcome. A bilateral oophorectomy at the time of elective hysterectomy is often performed to prevent ovarian cancer. The assumption that endogenous estrogen can be easily replaced with supplemental medication fosters the decision for routine oophorectomy. Published reports on the use of postmenopausal estrogen indicate that compliance is less than perfect. This fact could affect the overall outcome. Decision analysis techniques with Markov cohort modeling were used to evaluate the policy of elective bilateral oophorectomy. Results from studies judged methodologically sound were combined to determine values representing the influence of estrogen on coronary heart disease, breast cancer, and osteoporotic fracture. The decision tree also explicitly incorporated patient compliance. When compliance with estrogen therapy is assumed to be perfect, oophorectomy yields longer life expectancy than retaining the ovaries. When actual drug-taking behavior is considered, retaining the ovaries results in longer survival. This analysis highlights the importance of including the effects of patient compliance with treatment recommendations when the impact of a health policy decision such as prophylactic surgery is assessed. 
5	Relief of tracheal compression by aortopexy. We have performed aortopexy in 12 children with tracheal compression. Six infants had compression secondary to a vascular anomaly (group 1), and the other 6 had previous repair of esophageal atresia (group 2). Eleven of the 12 children are alive after a mean follow-up of 36 months. In group 1, 1 patient died and 3 patients (50%) experienced recurrent respiratory distress. Five infants sustained a major postoperative complication, and the average postoperative hospital stay was 25 days. In group 2, however, aortopexy was uniformly successful. There were no deaths, no postoperative complications, and no cases of postoperative respiratory distress, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was only 10 days. For children with reflex apnea after repair of esophageal atresia, aortopexy is lifesaving and can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. Great caution is indicated in children with tracheal compression from other causes. 
2	Transcatheter oily chemoembolization in the management of advanced hepatocellular carcinoma in cirrhosis: results of a Western comparative study in 60 patients. Transcatheter oily chemoembolization is widely used as palliative therapy for inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma in high-incidence Asiatic areas. To assess its usefulness in the Western form of this cancer, 30 French patients were treated between 1987 and 1990 by intraarterial hepatic injection of a Lipiodol-doxorubicin emulsion followed by embolization with 0.5 to 1 mm gelatin sponge particles. The number of procedures ranged from one to five. All patients had advanced, symptomatic and inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (Okuda's staging: I, n = 8; II, n = 14; III, n = 8); none was found under systematic screening. All had underlying cirrhosis (Child-Pugh's class: A, n = 15; B, n = 12; C, n = 3) that was alcoholic in origin in 27 cases and posthepatitic B in origin in 3 cases. The results of the treatment were assessed by comparison with a group of 30 untreated patients admitted to the same unit between 1984 and 1987. Patients of both groups were closely matched for clinical presentation, global disease staging and precise anatomical extension. The overall 1- and 2-yr survival rate was 59% and 30%, respectively, for the treated patients vs. 0% at 1 yr for the untreated patients. The latter all died from local disease with end-stage liver failure and/or uncontrollable variceal bleeding. In the former, the three patients with Child's class C cirrhosis died after the first procedure. During the follow-up (range = 3 to 26 mo), 11 additional patients died, 8 from metastatic generalization. 
5	Effects of aerobic exercise training on symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse. The effects of a 12-week aerobic exercise training protocol on 32 symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse were studied. Subjects were randomly assigned to control or exercise groups. Exercise subjects completed a 12-week (3 times per week) exercise training program based on guidelines established by the American Heart Association for phase II cardiac rehabilitation programs; control group subjects maintained normal activities. Before and after training, subjects underwent maximal multistage treadmill testing, and measurements were obtained for plasma catecholamine levels at rest and during peak exercise; they completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and General Well-Being Schedule. Weekly symptom frequency of chest pain, arm pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, mood swings, dizziness and syncope were monitored for the 12-week period. Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance, multivariate analysis of covariance, and analysis of covariance with repeated measures. Compared with control subjects, the exercise group showed a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in State Trait Anxiety Inventory scores, an increase in General Well-Being scores, an increase in functional capacity and a decline in the frequency of chest pain, fatigue, dizziness and mood swings. No statistically significant differences were noted in catecholamine levels at rest or during peak exercise. These findings support the use of aerobic exercise in the management of symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse. 
2	A multifactorial analysis of mortality and morbidity in perforated peptic ulcer disease. Perforated peptic ulcer disease remains a source of considerable morbidity and mortality, and the suggested methods of surgical therapy are diverse. We reviewed the course of 113 patients who were treated surgically and identified 14 factors that influenced the morbidity or mortality rates, or both. Multiple regression analysis showed that the number of coexisting medical conditions, a lower mean blood pressure level and the duration of acute perforation were independent risk factors for death, while age, use of a bronchodilator, a lower mean blood pressure level and the number of coexisting medical conditions correlated positively with all complications. A duodenal site was independently favorable with respect to all complications. The type of operation performed either simple closure, vagotomy and drainage or resection, did not influence morbidity or mortality. The most severely ill patients also did not benefit from any particular type of operation in the short term. Long term results were improved with definitive operation, as measured by the Visick classification and the need for reoperations. Definitive operations are recommended for virtually all patients with perforated peptic ulcer. 
5	Ovarian neoplasms and the risk of adnexal torsion. Previous reports examining adnexal torsion suggested that benign ovarian neoplasms are more likely to undergo torsion than malignant ovarian neoplasms. To our knowledge, this clinical observation has not been quantified. To examine this hypothesis, we reviewed our experience with ovarian neoplasms found at the time of surgery over a 10-year period. Benign ovarian neoplasms had a 12.9-fold increased risk of undergoing adnexal torsion when compared with malignant ovarian neoplasms (95% confidence interval, 10.2 to 15.9). The histologic type of ovarian neoplasm does not appear to affect the rate of adnexal torsion. Adnexal torsion rarely involves cancer. 
1	Aspergillus terreus endophthalmitis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. A 65-year-old woman with a 7-year history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia presented with acute visual loss, pain, and redness in her right eye. Results of stains and cultures of anterior chamber fluid were negative. Neurologic problems, bronchopulmonary pneumonia, recurrent skin lesions, and a low-grade fever developed. Progressive respiratory distress ensued, and the patient died 1 month after presentation. Cultures from antemortem sputum and skin samples were positive for Aspergillus terreus. Postmortem histologic results showed extensive A terreus invasion of the posterior vitreous, retina, choroid, and anterior optic nerve. This organism was also found in histologic sections from the right adrenal gland, left kidney, thyroid, urinary bladder, right lung, skin, esophagus, sputum, vessels of the myocardium, and brain. To our knowledge, A terreus endophthalmitis has not been reported previously. 
1	General assay for phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid: a candidate marker for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. The components of protein phosphorylation systems (protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and their phosphoprotein substrates) are highly enriched in neuronal cells compared with other cell types. We exploited this relative neuronal enrichment of protein phosphorylation system components to develop a general assay technique for putative protein kinase substrates (phosphoproteins) in human cerebrospinal fluid. Using this cerebrospinal fluid phosphoprotein assay, we have detected a putative protein kinase C substrate protein of apparent Mr 60 kd in 6 of 14 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration but not in any of 55 patients with a variety of other neurological diseases. Phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid may provide novel and unique markers for the diagnosis or staging of neuronal diseases as well as offer potential insights into the biochemical characterization of affected neuronal populations. 
5	A comparison of the efficacy and safety of pergolide and bromocriptine in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Pergolide is a synthetic ergoline derivative with highly potent long-acting PRL-lowering activity, allowing therapy of hyperprolactinemia with a once daily administration of the drug. The results of two open-label, randomized controlled multicenter clinical trials are reported. Pergolide (taken once a day), was compared with bromocriptine (taken two to four times daily) regarding efficacy and safety in the reduction of PRL levels, the cessation of galactorrhea and amenorrhea, the improvement in sexual function, and tumor shrinkage in hyperprolactinemia without (trial I; 61 patients) and with radiologically evident pituitary tumors (trial II; 96 patients). Both drugs were equally effective in lowering PRL levels in both trials. A median optimal dose of 50 micrograms pergolide and 5 mg bromocriptine/day suppressed PRL levels in the 61 patients of trial I by more than 80%. During the 24-week investigational period galactorrhea disappeared in 96% and 87% of patients, whereas menstruation returned in 90% and 96% of patients, respectively. An equally high efficacy (optimal median dose: 75-100 micrograms pergolide, 7.5-10 mg bromocriptine daily) was observed in trial II, although the resumption of menses was less frequent than in the patients of trial I (50% and 58% of patients, respectively). Sexual dysfunction improved similarly on both drugs in about half the patients. In addition, tumor shrinkage occurred to a similar extent with both drugs. A high incidence of adverse events was noted especially at the initiation of therapy with both compounds: nausea, dizziness, vomiting, asthenia, headache, and decrease in blood pressure occurred at a similar incidence and extent during the use of pergolide and bromocriptine. Patients in trial I treated with pergolide reported a slightly higher incidence of fever, vasodilatation, and flu syndrome. Conclusions: in these 24-week studies comprising a total of 157 hyperprolactinemic patients, a once daily administration of pergolide was shown to be as safe and effective as the two to four times daily ingestion of bromocriptine. Longer-acting dopamine agonists like pergolide that can be taken once daily, are likely to increase the ease to adherence to the therapeutic regimen. This might result in a higher compliance to medical treatment of hyperprolactinemia. 
5	Outbreak of spontaneous staphylococcal arthritis and osteitis in mice. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacterial species found in association with nongonococcal bacterial arthritis in humans. We present here the first description of spontaneous bacterial arthritis and osteitis in mice. Clinically, the most obvious findings were swelling and/or ankylosis of hindpaws and nodose changes of the tail. The prevalence of arthritis and osteitis ranged from 0% to greater than 50% of the mice studied, depending on the mouse strain. The most prominent histopathologic feature of the arthritis was hypertrophy of the synovial tissue and destruction of cartilage and underlying bone. Most of the S aureus-infected mice displayed an identical phage type, which was also the only S aureus phage type found in skin isolates from clinically healthy mice. However, a few S aureus isolates were not typeable, indicating that an additional strain(s) might cause bacterial arthritis in mice. 
5	Paralytic shellfish poisoning--Massachusetts and Alaska, 1990 [published erratum appears in MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep 1991 Apr 12;40(14):242] Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is a foodborne illness caused by consumption of shellfish or broth from cooked shellfish that contain either concentrated saxitoxin, an alkaloid neurotoxin, or related compounds. This report summarizes outbreaks of PSP that occurred in Massachusetts and Alaska in June 1990. 
4	Cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem component. A report of seven cases. Seven patients had a cardiac arrest during hip arthroplasty with a cemented long-stem femoral component. Four patients died in the operating room, and three patients were successfully resuscitated. When the three survivors were eventually discharged from the hospital, they had no known permanent cardiac, pulmonary, or neurological sequelae. Factors that were common to all of the patients were advanced age, osteoporotic bone, a previously undisturbed intramedullary canal, and use of a long-stem femoral component and several batches of methylmethacrylate. Hip arthroplasty with a long-stem femoral component is associated with substantial risk in these patients. Excessive pressurization of cement should be avoided, and invasive hemodynamic monitoring should be used when the described conditions are present. 
5	Endothelium-dependent responses in long-term human coronary artery bypass grafts. In the present study, responses of long-term human coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs) to known endothelium-dependent vasodilators, acetylcholine, calcium ionophore A23187, thrombin, and histamine, as well as authentic nitric oxide, the putative endothelium-derived relaxing factor, were studied. Sixteen CAGBs were isolated within 1-2 hours from hearts of 14 patients receiving a cardiac transplant. A total of 109 ring segments were prepared from these CABGs and studied in vitro. The duration of the CABGs ranged from 7 months to 12 years. Addition of acetylcholine (0.01-10 microM), calcium ionophore A23187 (0.01-1.0 microM), thrombin (0.01-1.0 unit/ml), and histamine (0.01-1.0 microM) consistently produced a dose- and endothelium-dependent relaxation, reaching a maximum of -35.3 +/- 3.3%, -45.3 +/- 5.5%, -26.9 +/- 4.8%, and -17.8 +/- 2.5% (mean +/- SEM), respectively. No significant difference was observed among the CABGs with different duration of transplantation, whereas the relaxant responses of different segments along the entire length of a CABG were markedly different. These latter differences in the endothelium-dependent responses appear to correlate inversely with the development of intimal proliferative lesions in these CABGs. Addition of nitric oxide (0.01-10 microM) produced a potent dose- and endothelium-independent relaxation, which was also slightly depressed in CABGs with severe intimal proliferation. These results demonstrate that long-term transplanted human saphenous vein grafts retain their endothelium-dependent responses and that development of severe intimal proliferative lesions, rather than the duration of the grafts, result in marked alterations in the reactivity of these transplanted CABGs. 
3	Symptomatic pineal cyst: case report. Pineal cysts are being described with increasing frequency since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging. Although pineal cysts are incidental findings in as many as 4% of magnetic resonance imaging studies, symptomatic pineal cysts are quite rare. We present a case of pineal cyst causing aqueductal obstruction with symptomatic hydrocephalus and resultant headache and syncope, which was treated by surgical resection. A review of the relevant literature and discussion follow. 
2	Starch peritonitis. A case report and clinicopathologic review. A case of starch peritonitis is presented with a review of the history of this continuing problem. The syndrome's presentation, diagnosis, histopathology and treatment are discussed. The rarity of starch peritonitis today may be due to more attention to glove washing by surgeons, fewer impurities in the glove powder or lack of recognition of the syndrome. In order to prevent a resurgence of the starch peritonitis syndrome we must continue to emphasize the importance of washing gloves, maintain the quality control and purity of the powder used, and be cognizant of the signs and symptoms so that such cases may be managed nonoperatively. 
4	Effect of maintenance digoxin therapy on aerobic performance and exercise left ventricular function in mild to moderate heart failure due to coronary artery disease: a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Despite 200 years of use, the ability of digitalis glycosides to improve exercise capacity in patients with congestive heart failure remains controversial, partly because of imprecise end points and suboptimal study design. Therefore, this question was examined in 10 ambulatory patients (8 men and 2 women) aged 46 to 70 years (mean 57.8) in sinus rhythm with mild to moderate chronic stable congestive heart failure due to coronary artery disease and systolic left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 32 +/- 12). All underwent maximal treadmill exercise with respiratory gas analysis and upright cycle ergometry with gated radionuclide angiography after 4 weeks of digoxin or placebo therapy, administered in a randomized double-blind crossover protocol. Neither treadmill exercise duration (7.7 +/- 2.3 versus 7.3 +/- 2.7 min) nor peak oxygen consumption (18.7 +/- 3.7 versus 18.4 +/- 5.4 ml/kg per min) differed between digoxin and placebo regimens. However, the change in peak oxygen consumption induced by digoxin was inversely related to the peak oxygen consumption during placebo therapy (r = -0.64, p less than 0.05). At maximal treadmill effort, heart rate (138 +/- 16 versus 141 +/- 21 beats/min), oxygen pulse (10.3 +/- 2.1 versus 9.9 +/- 2.2 ml/beat), ventilation (40.3 +/- 10.6 versus 42.0 +/- 10.8 liters/min) and ventilatory equivalent (29.4 +/- 4.8 versus 31.5 +/- 6.8) did not differ between digoxin and placebo treatment, although systolic blood pressure was higher during digoxin therapy (163.0 +/- 23.1 versus 153.2 +/- 25.3 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). 
1	The physical state of human papillomavirus 16 DNA in cervical carcinoma and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Cervical carcinomas and cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) were analyzed for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA using Southern blot hybridization. Of the five HPV types examined (HPV types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33), HPV 16 DNA was detected most frequently. In most HPV 16-positive carcinomas examined, HPV 16 DNA was present in an integrated state in cellular DNA with or without the coexistence of episomal species. In one case, however, only episomal species were detected. Among seven cases of HPV 16-positive CIN, four contained HPV 16 DNA only in the episomal state and the rest contained HPV 16 DNA only in the integrated state, but the coexistence of both states was not found. These results suggest that the integration of HPV 16 DNA is not necessary for cells to become malignant, although it is frequently associated with malignant cells. 
3	Severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption. A severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption is described. Data are presented to show a significant absorption of lidocaine through diseased skin when lidocaine cream is used as a local anesthetic. Awareness of this route of intoxication might be important in patients in whom neurologic or psychiatric symptoms develop while large amounts of lidocaine cream are being used. 
3	Effects of short spaceflights on mechanical characteristics of rat muscles. The aim of this study was to investigate the contractile protein characteristics after 5-day (Cosmos 1514) and 7-day (Cosmos 1667) spaceflights. The experiments were performed on skinned fibers from the soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis, and plantaris muscles isolated from Wistar rats. A reduction in fiber diameter might explain the decrease in the maximal tension in the soleus, whereas this tension was unaltered in the gastrocnemius and the plantaris. Moreover the calcium sensitivity of the myofilament appeared modified in the soleus and in the gastrocnemius: The tension/pCa relationships were shifted toward higher calcium concentrations, indicating a decrease in the apparent calcium binding constant of the troponin C. The tension/pCa relationship appeared unaltered in the plantaris after spaceflight. Finally, the studies of the time to reach a steady tension indicated an increase in the rate of force development in the soleus and, on the contrary, a slowing down in the plantaris. No change in the gastrocnemius was found. The results were analyzed with references to the different muscle functions in disuse atrophy. 
2	Dyspareunia. Tracing the cause. Difficult or painful sexual intercourse is a sensitive topic for most women. The causes range from inflammation of the vulva and interstitial cystitis to marital discord. To exclude an organic disorder, a detailed pelvic examination with good lighting and magnification is in order. Dr DeWitt describes the technique for meticulous examination and discusses the diagnoses that need to be considered. 
4	Atrial fibrillation with cardiac tamponade as the initial manifestation of malignant pericarditis This article describes the case of a 72-year-old woman with cardiac tamponade and atrial fibrillation as the initial manifestation of a lymphoid malignancy. The pathogenesis of cardiac tamponade, various diagnostic modalities, and therapy of this condition are reviewed. 
1	Hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with persistent Helicobacter pylori infection and active gastritis. We report two cases of patients with 3-yr histories of upper gastrointestinal symptoms, hyperplastic gastric polyps, and active chronic gastritis. Biopsies retrospectively stained with Giemsa revealed the persistent presence of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in gastric biopsies of both patients throughout the 3 yr. After treatment with amoxicillin and bismuth subsalicylate, both became asymptomatic, one demonstrating disappearance and recurrence of the gastric polyps in conjunction with the HP. These cases demonstrate 3 yr of hyperplastic gastric polyps associated with HP and active gastritis. 
4	Antihypertensive effect and pharmacokinetics of nitrendipine in children. Nitrendipine, a new calcium-channel antagonist, was used to treat 25 children (aged 6 months to 17 years) with severe hypertension. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures (mean +/- SEM) fell from 148 +/- 2/99 +/- 2 mm Hg to 128 +/- 4/77 +/- 3 mm Hg after 24 hours and to 121 +/- 2/75 +/- 2 mm Hg after 2 weeks. No further reductions in systolic or diastolic blood pressure were observed after continued therapy. Transient reflex tachycardia occurred during the first week of therapy. Other adverse effects were uncommon and included headaches, flushing, palpitations, and edema. Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated at steady state after an oral dose of 0.56 +/- 0.04 mg/kg in 13 children. Although absolute oral bioavailability could not be determined, estimates of the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve, the apparent peak serum concentration, and the apparent time at which the peak serum concentration occurred indicated that both the rate of absorption and oral bioavailability are variable. Coadministration of nitrendipine with food decreased the rate of absorption and may have reduced oral bioavailability. A relationship between age and the apparent plasma elimination half-life of nitrendipine was not observed. Nitrendipine, 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg per dose administered orally every 6 to 12 hours, appeared to be an effective and safe treatment for resistant hypertension in infants and children. 
4	Ascites not due to congestive heart failure in a fetus with lupus-induced heart block. Hydrops developing in fetuses with lupus-associated heart block has usually been assumed to result from congestive heart failure. We present a case in which fetal ascites associated with complete heart block resolved promptly after administration of betamethasone and prednisone to the mother, who had anti-SSA and who developed clinical lupus erythematosus. This resolution occurred with no demonstrable change in fetal cardiac function. We conclude that an immune mechanism, rather than congestive heart failure, was responsible for the fetal ascites. 
1	The natural history of colorectal cancer. Opportunities for intervention. There is now a better understanding of the natural history of colorectal cancer, which has provided a basis for intervention to influence outcome. The possible interventions include earlier detection of colorectal cancer, removal of premalignant adenomas, demonstration of the mucosal field defect that precedes neoplasia to evaluate baseline risk and its change with dietary modification, and identification of inherited and dietary risk factors. Five controlled trials evaluating early detection of colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing have enrolled more than 309,000 patients. Early stage cancers with improved survival has been observed, but data on mortality reduction have not as yet been reported. Studies of patients with adenomas have demonstrated high synchronous and metachronous rates as a basis for complete colon evaluation initially and a surveillance follow-up program. Hyperproliferation and lack of normal differentiation have been observed as a field defect in the colon preceding neoplasia. Inherited factors have recently been shown to be important in a larger proportion of individuals destined to develop colorectal adenomas and cancer. These observations of the natural history of colorectal cancer have provided new opportunities for the application of radiologic and endoscopic techniques in diagnosis and surveillance; each examination has its merit. Further research is needed to answer many critical questions that have been raised regarding the impact of these interventions. 
2	Anal sphincter function after intersphincteric resection and stapled ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. This study was done to determine the effect of the direct ileal pouch-anal anastomosis upon pressure and sensory components of the anal canal and ileal pouch. These findings were related to postoperative continence. Thirty-three patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (25 continent, eight with episodic minor incontinence) were studied 3 +/- 0.3 and 25 +/- 5 months after ileostomy takedown. The maximum resting pressure in the anal canal was significantly lower in patients with an imperfect result (35 +/- 5 mm Hg) than in continent patients (44 +/- 5 mm Hg) (P less than 0.05). Postoperatively the maximum squeeze anal pressure was slightly greater in continent than in incontinent patients (99 +/- 8 mm Hg vs. 87 +/- 7 mm Hg) (P greater than 0.05). The postoperative recto-(ileo-)anal inhibitory reflex was present in 27 percent. The linear correlation between strength of rectal (ileal) distension and depth resp. duration of internal sphincter relaxation as preoperatively observed disappeared postoperatively in every group of patients. Simultaneous measurements of pouch and anal pressure in patients with imperfect results revealed a reduced positive pouch anal pressure gradient compared to the continent group. This low pouch-anal pressure gradient is thought to be responsible for the increased incidence of soiling in some of our patients. 
4	Platelet activation by emotional stress in patients with coronary artery disease. We studied the effects of experimentally induced emotional stress (mental arithmetic) on different hemodynamic parameters, catecholamine levels, and serum and platelet function tests in 25 postinfarction patients and in 10 apparently healthy, age-matched control subjects. Mental stress (10 minutes) induced significant increments in heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, double product, and cardiac output, indicating a sympatho-adrenal stimulation that was confirmed by a significant increase in serum epinephrine and norepinephrine levels. All of the effects disappeared at minute 10 of recovery. Concomitantly, the test produced a significant increase in platelet aggregation (induced by 3 microM ADP or 1 microgram/ml collagen), the formation of circulating platelet aggregates, and an increase in thromboxane B2 levels in plasma and serum. These effects were also rapidly reversible. Similar activation of hemodynamic parameters and a similar but less evident increase in platelet function by emotional stress were observed in control subjects. A possible artifact due to factitious platelet activation by catheter sampling was excluded with experiments in which a 40-minute rest was introduced after the baseline period and before mental stress; platelet activation did not occur during baseline or rest periods, only after emotional stress. Furthermore, the antiplatelet drug dipyridamole reduced the stress-induced formation of platelet aggregates in postinfarction patients. These results demonstrate the existence of a direct link between emotional stress and platelet function and offer an explanation of one of the mechanisms through which mental stress may be involved in the development of coronary artery disease. 
2	Sucralfate used as adjunctive therapy in patients with severe erosive peptic esophagitis resulting from gastroesophageal reflux. A total of 36 patients with grade 2 or greater erosive esophagitis and an abnormal 24-h pH monitor study, were treated in a randomized, double-blind fashion to assess the efficacy of sucralfate suspension as adjunctive therapy to cimetidine for severe esophagitis secondary to gastroesophageal reflux. Treatment consisted of cimetidine, 300 mg qid and either sucralfate suspension (1 g/10 ml) or an identical placebo suspension, 10 ml after meals and 20 ml hs. Patients were treated for 12 wk unless endoscopic healing occurred earlier. Initial evaluation and monthly follow-up consisted of symptom monitoring, endoscopic evaluation and pre- and post-therapy esophageal manometry, Bernstein test, and 24-h pH monitoring. The combination of cimetidine and sucralfate suspension was superior to cimetidine alone in improving daytime heartburn symptoms (p less than 0.05) but not nighttime heartburn, dysphagia, or regurgitation. Sucralfate plus cimetidine improved the overall endoscopic outcome of esophagitis more than cimetidine alone (p less than 0.05). More patients exhibited endoscopic healing in the adjunctive sucralfate group than in the cimetidine-only group. Endoscopic healing, however, was not statistically different between groups. We conclude that sucralfate used as adjunctive therapy to cimetidine resulted in improvement of some of the symptoms of reflux, and probably increases the likelihood of complete healing of esophagitis, compared with cimetidine alone. 
3	Spinal cord injury after subclavian flap aortoplasty. An experimental study in piglets. Paraplegia is a rare but much feared complication of corrective surgery for coarctation of the aorta. The problem was studied in 31 newborn pigs submitted to subclavian flap aortoplasty. The aortic cross-clamping time ranged from 9-25 min. Twenty-three piglets with clamping times 9-18 min were neurologically intact, whereas eight with aortic clamping for 18-25 min became paraplegic. The clinical implications for newborn children with symptomatic aortic coarctation are discussed with regard to these experimental findings. 
5	Salpingoscopy in patients with contralateral ectopic pregnancy. Patients who experience a tubal pregnancy have a poor prognosis in terms of reproductive potential and are at increased risk of a repeat EP. Salpingoscopy is a new endoscopic technique that allows the detection of abnormalities of the tubal mucosa. In seven patients with a follow-up longer than 6 months, an IUP occurred only in patients with a normal ampullary mucosa, whereas a recurrent tubal pregnancy occurred in the patient that conceived with an abnormal tubal mucosa. These preliminary results suggest that salpingoscopy may constitute an important prognostic factor in these patients. 
2	Primary malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. A report of seven cases and a review of the literature. Mesothelioma of the peritoneum is a rare malignant neoplasm easily mistaken by both surgeon and pathologist for one of the more common neoplasms of the abdomen. Review of our records from metropolitan-area hospitals for the past 15 years identified seven patients with primary peritoneal mesotheliomas. Their diagnosis, management, and survival is analyzed. We report a case of an extended survivor (7 years) and one of a long-term survivor (15 years), as well as what we believe to be the only case in the literature presenting with a coexistent malignant neoplasm. Prevention of this commonly fatal neoplasm is linked to avoiding occupational exposure to asbestos; long-term survival for a few patients may be achieved with correct identification of the neoplasm and aggressive management. This report includes a review of the literature. 
4	Drug-induced supraventricular tachycardia: a case report of fluoxetine. We report the occurrence of supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension in a 54-year-old woman after maintenance therapy with fluoxetine. Although cases of tachycardia and palpitations have been reported, supraventricular tachycardia and hypotension have not been directly attributed to fluoxetine. 
3	Acute tolerance in morphine analgesia: continuous infusion and single injection in rats. This study aimed to determine whether the decline of the analgesic effect of morphine with a continuous infusion or that after a single injection correlates with the changes in brain concentration of morphine. The analgesic effect of morphine and its brain and serum concentrations were determined with a continuous 8-h infusion at a constant rate and after a single subcutaneous injection of the agent. The analgesic effect was determined by measuring the threshold of motor response to noxious stimulation. Brain and serum concentrations of morphine were detected by radioimmunoassay with the use of 125I-labeled morphine. With the constant-rate (4 mg.kg-1.h-1, intravenous) morphine infusion, the peak of analgesia could not be maintained: the increase in the pain threshold at 2 h was 1,003 g and at 8h was 286 g (a decrease in analgesia by 72%, P less than 0.0002). At the same time, the brain morphine concentration tended to increase, to 278 ng/g at 2 h and 329 ng/g at 8 h. After the single morphine injection (6 mg/kg, subcutaneous), recovery from analgesia occurred at a much faster rate than did the decrease in morphine brain concentration; the decrease in pain threshold was 79% at 90 vs. 30 min after the injection (P less than 0.0001), and the corresponding decrease in brain concentration was 28% (NS). The absence of correlation between analgesia and morphine brain concentration both with the constant-rate morphine infusion and after the single injection suggests the development of acute tolerance, which is pharmacodynamic in nature. 
3	Kindling susceptibility and genetic seizure predisposition in inbred mice. Olfactory bulb kindling rates were studied in two inbred strains of genetically seizure-prone mice (DBA/2 and El) and in three non-epileptic inbred strains [C57BL/6 (B6), ddY, and C3H/He (C3H)]. None of the DBA/2 mice had been stimulated to seizure before or during the kindling and all mice were studied at 4-6 weeks of age, before development of spontaneous or movement-induced seizure activity in the El strain. The audiogenically seizure-susceptible DBA/2 mice required the fewest number of stimulations to reach stage 5 seizure (mean +/- SE = 4.0 +/- 0.6). The nonepileptic C3H mice required the most stimulations to reach stage 5 seizures (22.6 +/- 1.4). Kindling rates for B6 (9.6 +/- 0.6), El (14.8 +/- 1.1), and ddY (18.5 +/- 1.0) strains were intermediate, and the kindling rate for each strain was significantly different from that of the other strains. These findings show that the seizure-susceptible El mouse kindles more rapidly than the genetically similar but nonepileptic ddY control and suggest that an inherited seizure susceptibility accelerates the kindling rate. Nonepileptic B6 mice kindled more rapidly than El mice, however, suggesting that genetic factors other than those that influence seizure susceptibility are of primary importance in the determination of the kindling rate. 
5	The surgical treatment of atrial fibrillation. I. Summary of the current concepts of the mechanisms of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia that is frequently resistant to medical therapy and has no satisfactory surgical therapy. The development of an effective surgical procedure to treat atrial fibrillation has been hampered by the paucity of clinically relevant information on the basic mechanisms responsible for the arrhythmia. This paper summarizes the current concepts of the electrophysiologic abnormalities in atrial flutter and fibrillation. 
5	Do life events or depression exacerbate inflammatory bowel disease? A prospective study. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether depressed mood or life events are associated with an exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease. DESIGN: A prospective study of a consecutive sample of patients with relapsing inflammatory bowel disease, followed by monthly questionnaires and periodic office visits. SETTING: A referral-based gastroenterology clinic at a medical school. PATIENTS: A consecutive sample of 32 patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had had at least one relapse in a 2-year period after entry into the study. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Social Readjustment Rating Scale (measuring life events), the Beck Depression Inventory (a visual analog scale for depressed mood) and an inventory of intestinal symptoms were completed monthly by each subject with a 78% rate of compliance. A mean of 2.2 exacerbations was seen per subject during the study period. Life events were not temporally associated with changes in intestinal symptoms. Significant associations were found between intestinal symptoms and the two mood scales (P less than 0.05 for each), but no directionality in symptom occurrence could be detected in a time-lagged analysis. The results were similar when the months preceding exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease were analyzed separately. CONCLUSIONS: Although these findings suggest that mood changed concurrently with exacerbation of inflammatory bowel disease, no evidence indicated that stressful life events or depressed mood precipitated exacerbations in this study group. 
2	Esophageal candidiasis in AIDS. Successful therapy with clotrimazole vaginal tablets taken by mouth. In this paper we describe the results of oral therapy of esophageal candidiasis with clotrimazole vaginal tablets in 25 homosexual men with AIDS, of whom 19 had oral candidiasis and 16 had esophageal symptoms. Therapy with clotrimazole vaginal tablets, 100 mg, taken by mouth cleared the esophageal symptoms, oral candidiasis, and esophageal lesions completely in all 25 men. Clotrimazole vaginal tablets are a useful alternative to other antifungal agents for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis in AIDS patients. 
5	Delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression. We report two unusual cases of delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression of structures within the cerebellopontine angle. In the first case, the patient noted a unilateral hearing loss 3 weeks after undergoing vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve for tic douloureux. This gradually improved over an 18-month period. In the second case, the patient awoke on the 4th day after vascular decompression of the facial nerve for hemifacial spasm with a bilateral hearing loss that has remained unchanged after the onset. These are examples of delayed acoustic dysfunction occurring with a shift in surgically freed vessels and may have been induced by newly directed neurovascular compression or distortion. 
3	The "stuck twin" phenomenon: ultrasonographic findings, pregnancy outcome, and management with serial amniocenteses. Thirteen consecutive twin pregnancies affected by the "stuck twin" phenomenon were reviewed to determine the potential benefit of serial amniocenteses. The fetal survival rate for the eight pregnancies that underwent serial amniocenteses was 69% (11 of 16 fetuses). This is significantly improved compared with a fetal survival rate of 20% among the five preceding pregnancies managed without serial amniocenteses at the same institution (p = 0.01). It is also markedly improved compared with a combined fetal survival rate of 16% among 48 previously reported pregnancies with the stuck twin phenomenon managed without serial amniocenteses (p less than 0.0001). Survival correlated with the absence of concomitant pregnancy complications (i.e., maternal hypertension or intractable labor) and with the absence of severe fetal structural abnormalities. Procedural complications occurred in three of eight pregnancies (37.5%) managed with serial amniocenteses and was attributed as a cause of fetal death in one case. Two of 11 survivors (18%) had complications after serial amniocenteses including brain infarction and renal tubular necrosis. Serial amniocenteses may significantly improve the survival rate of twin gestations affected by the stuck twin phenomenon but may be associated with complications among survivors. 
1	Surgical staging of cervical cancer. Noninvasive radiologic methods to detect paraaortic lymph node metastases are reliable when combined with FNA of enlarged lymph nodes. However, the sensitivity is low, and undetected microscopic metastases leads to treatment failure. These patients with paraaortic lymph node metastasis are not treated with extended-field radiation, and they all die within 3 years. The CT scanning is probably the best diagnostic method to evaluate cervical cancer, because it can assess the primary tumor, the urinary tract, gastrointestinal tract, liver parenchyma, and retroperitoneum. It also permits the guidance of FNA and the arrangement of radiation ports. Surgical staging provides the direct assessment of the peritoneal cavity and the retroperitoneal spaces. Metastatic tumor, including enlarged lymph nodes, can be resected, but this is of dubious benefit. The operative morbidity is acceptable, with fewer intestinal complications when the extraperitoneal approach is used, and long-term morbidity is minimal when appropriate paraaortic radiation doses are employed (less than 5,000 cGy). Surgical staging has provided data on the frequency of paraaortic lymph node metastasis by stage of cervical cancer, and thus, treatment strategies can be better developed. Extended-field radiation results in 5-year survival rates of 20-25% in patients with microscopic paraaortic lymph node metastasis, patients who would not survive without the treatment. However, surgical staging has produced only a modest boost in survival rates, because of the high rate of pelvic and systemic failure. When extended-field radiation is used prophylactically or in patients with probable lymph node metastasis seen on radiographic studies, survival rates are similar to patients irradiated after surgical staging finds paraaortic lymph node disease. As our ability to predict, and detect nonsurgically, positive paraaortic node disease improves, extended radiation (or other adjuvant therapy) could be used more frequently without operation in patients who are at high risk for metastatic disease. In a study by Haie et al, prophylactic paraaortic radiation was given to patients at high risk for paraaortic metastasis. In patients with a high probability of local disease control, paraaortic radiation significantly reduced the incidence of paraaortic and distant metastases. Patients with known paraaortic lymph node metastases frequently have occult systemic metastases. In these same patients, pelvic failure is also common. Thus, until effective systemic therapies emerge, a marked improvement in survival is unlikely in patients who have paraaortic lymph node metastasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
5	Inner ear cholesteatoma and the preservation of cochlear function. Labyrinthine destruction by direct cholesteatoma invasion has always been considered a serious threat to the inner ear function. A number of reports in the literature have cited both patients who had preservation of hearing despite widespread erosion of the labyrinth by cholesteatoma and patients who had retained auditory function despite surgical removal of the matrix from the labyrinth. In most cases the vestibular portion of the inner ear was invaded but cases of cochlear involvement have been described as well. Twelve cases with pre-operative auditory function preservation despite extensive labyrinthine destruction treated at our Institution are reported. Seven cases retained cochlear function post-operatively. Possible explanations of this occurrence and implications of related with hearing preservation in the presence of widespread inner ear destruction by chronic inflammatory disease are discussed. 
3	The progression of mild idiopathic dementia in a community population. Thirty-one subjects aged 75 years and over who were identified as suffering from mild, idiopathic dementia in a large community survey were reviewed at annual intervals for 2 years. Diagnoses and severity ratings were based on defined criteria following a mental state examination, a medical and psychiatric history, detailed cognitive testing, and an interview with relatives or other key informants. Fourteen subjects became more severely demented within 2 years. The initial cognitive test battery failed to reveal any differences between respondents whose dementia advanced and those whose condition remained unchanged, but, in the former group, subjects' symptoms had been present for longer, and a greater proportion had been recognised as demented, or possibly demented, by their general practitioners. We suggest that subjects whose dementia progressed had actually been more severely disabled at the time of identification. 
4	Studies of myocardial protection in the immature heart. I. Enhanced tolerance of immature versus adult myocardium to global ischemia with reference to metabolic differences. This study compares the metabolism and functional responses of adult and immature hearts to a standard ischemic insult. Ten adult dogs (25 to 27 kg) and 10 puppies (6 to 10 weeks old) underwent 45 minutes of aortic clamping on bypass. Preoperative and postoperative ventricular performance (Starling curves), biochemical factors, and water content were measured. Global ischemia in adults produced a 30% mortality rate (3/10) and low output syndrome in survivors (33% recovery of stroke work index). Conversely, all puppies survived and stroke work index returned to 85% of control, with less edema developing (0.4% versus 2% water gain, p less than 0.05). Puppies expended comparable glycogen stores but used more glutamate (15.4 versus 8.6 mumol/gm dry weight), produced more alanine (18.9 versus 6.4 mumol, p less than 0.05), succinate (19 versus 8.2 mumol, p less than 0.05), and malate (2.6 versus 0.15 mumol, p less than 0.05) during ischemia, and recovered better postischemic aerobic metabolism (410 versus 255 nmol tissue pyruvate, p less than 0.05). We conclude that tolerance of immature hearts to ischemia is related to amino acid utilization by transamination and increased substrate level phosphorylation, as occurring in diving mammals, suggesting retention of intrautero adaptive mechanisms. 
5	Carotid endarterectomy for chronic retinal ischemia. Carotid arterial disease may result in a variety of ischemic ocular problems that can eventually lead to permanent blindness. From 1984 to 1988, 18 patients underwent reconstruction of the carotid artery in an attempt to restore normal retinal arterial flow and, thereby, reverse or prevent progression of ischemic oculopathy. During a mean period of 21 months after carotid arterial reconstruction, subjective improvement in vision as well as a resolution in eye and periorbital pain was reported in 87.5 per cent of the patients. Measured visual acuity improved or stabilized in 94.4 per cent; macular photostress recovery times improved in 87.5 per cent, funduscopic examinations noted improvement or resolution in ischemic signs in 93.3 per cent and intraocular pressures improved in two of three patients. One patient experienced recurrent episodes of amaurosis fugax, which resolved after two weeks and did not recur. A second patient experienced an increase in intraocular pressures with visual deterioration, required laser photocoagulation after which the condition of the patient stabilized but only after significant visual impairment. Carotid arterial reconstruction is effective for the treatment of ischemic oculopathy and is most beneficial if performed early, before the onset of irreversible neovascular glaucoma. 
2	Aetiology of pancreatic cancer Curative surgery is possible in only a small minority of patients with pancreatic cancer and, to date, responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been disappointing. To make any impact on the incidence of the disease a clearer understanding of its aetiology is required. This review explores present knowledge of the aetiology and epidemiology of pancreatic cancer. 
5	Ascites revealing peritoneal and hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis with peliosis in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia: case report and review of the literature. A 61-year-old man presented with ascites in the course of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM). Ascitic fluid was exudative and contained mature and immature leukocytes, erythroid cells, and megakaryocytes as observed on a bone marrow smear. Peritoneal biopsy showed myeloid metaplasia, and liver biopsy revealed intrasinusoidal myeloid metaplasia and peliosis. Ascites cleared after abdominal radiotherapy but treatment resulted in transient aplasia. Subsequently, portal hypertension was demonstrated by hepatic transjugular catheterization. Complications of splenomegaly led to splenectomy and splenorenal shunt followed by fatal acute hepatitis and septic shock. A review of the literature and an analysis of mechanisms of ascites occurring in AMM, especially peritoneal implants of myeloid tissue and occurrence of peliosis in myeloproliferative disorders, are presented. 
4	The dynamics of platelet thrombus formation rate, thrombus retention time, and rate of embolization on a control and heparin bonded polyurethane angio-catheter. The dynamics of platelet deposition and embolization from control and heparin bonded polyurethane catheters (CPC and HBPC) was evaluated with In-111 labeled autologous platelets (IN-PLT) and a computerized gamma camera (CGC). Ten non-heparinized dogs (18-25 kg) were catheterized in both femoral arteries with 10 cm of CPC and HBPC (5 Fr., Cordis) 24 hr after injection of 300-420 microCi of In-PLT, and imaged for 3 hr with the computerized gamma camera. The regional platelet deposition curves (RPDC) indicated multiple peaks and valleys; the curves were analyzed for early rate of thrombus formation (upswing), thrombus retention time (full width at half maxima of the RPDC-peak), and rate of embolization (downswing) on both catheters. The four parameters (mean +/- SD) of thrombosis on catheters and integral of the radioactivity time curve for the 3 hr duration of imaging were calculated from normalized counts/sec. The rate of thrombus formation and rate of embolization are higher for the control than HBPC, suggesting that heparin-bonding decreases the early rate of thrombosis and embolization. The thrombus adhesivity and retention time appear shorter for the control catheter, indicating that the control thrombogenic catheter forms multiple thrombi and emboli than HBPC. The integral appears larger for the control catheter than HBPC. In vivo (dynamic) studies, in vitro studies, and critical analyses of the radioactivity time curve were essential for complete evaluation of thrombogenicity of catheters and other cardiovascular prostheses. 
2	Jejunal-rectal fistula as a complication of postoperative radiotherapy. We present the case of a patient with an unusual, complex enteric fistula with multiple tracts and associated abscesses. The fistula was a late complication of radiotherapy, administered three years earlier, after resection for carcinoma of the sigmoid colon. Most of the small bowel was involved in the radiation-induced disease. A wide resection was performed successfully. This report reviews current literature on intra-abdominal postradiotherapy injuries, particularly intestinal fistulae. 
4	Coronary bypass surgery: is the operation different today? Patients undergoing coronary bypass grafting have undergone an evolution in recent years. To document this change, we analyzed two groups of patients in 1981 (n = 1586) and 1987 (n = 1513) to document preoperative and postoperative variables important in determining immediate morbidity and mortality after isolated coronary bypass. Between 1981 and 1987, patients were found to be older (greater than or equal to 70 years, 8.7% versus 21.8%, p less than 0.0001), more often diabetic (15% versus 24%, p less than 0.0001), have a greater prevalence of triple vessel disease (14.5% versus 46.1%, p less than 0.0001), and have more left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction 0.60 +/- 14 versus 0.54 +/- 13, p less than 0.0001). To facilitate analysis and because of overlap between subgroups, we subdivided patients into three subgroups for statistical comparison of the years 1981 and 1987: subgroup I, no prior procedure (n = 1546 in 1981 and 1396 in 1987); subgroup II, optimal group (n = 503 in 1981 and 292 in 1987, and defined as no prior procedure, ejection fraction greater than or equal to 0.50 and age less than 65 years); subgroup III, patients having reoperations (n = 40 in 1981 and 117 in 1987). Internal mammary artery grafting was infrequently used in 1981 but was used in 72.1% in 1987. Major postoperative morbidity between the 2 years for the total population increased significantly: need for intraaortic balloon pumping, 1.4% versus 4.7%, p less than 0.0001; myocardial infarction 3.5% versus 5.5%, p less than 0.008; stroke, 1.4% versus 2.8%, p less than 0.008; and wound infection, 1.0% versus 3.0%, p less than 0.001. Wound infection (all types) in 1987 was increased sevenfold in patients having a perioperative myocardial infarction (0.7% versus 5%, p less than 0.0001). For young patients with good left ventricular function (subgroup II), there was no increase in these morbid events between 1981 and 1987. Hospital mortality in the total population increased significantly between 1981 and 1987 from 1.2% to 3.1% (p less than 0.0002), respectively. It was lowest for the patients in optimal condition (subgroup II) in both years, 0.8% versus 1.1%, and highest for reoperative patients, 5.3% versus 4.3%. In 1981, 58% of patients (503/870) were in the optimal group compared with 35% (292/828) in 1987 (p less than 0.0001). The last six years have seen a progressive trend in surgically treating older, sicker patients who have more complex disease, with a significant reduction in the best candidate group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
4	Job dimensions associated with severe disability due to cardiovascular disease. This study explored associations among job activities and disability due to cardiovascular disease by merging national disability data with independently-obtained job activity data. Disability data were taken from a 1978 U.S. health interview survey (n = 9855). Expert ratings of job activities (dimensions) were obtained from a job analysis database (n = 2485 occupations). The two databases were merged such that job dimension data were imputed to each occupation in the disability database. Odds ratios for cardiovascular disability were calculated for scores in the second, third, and fourth quartiles for each of the 32 job dimensions, using scores in the first quartile as the standard. Job dimensions associated with cardiovascular disability were (a) hazardous situations; (b) vigilant work and responsibility for others; (c) exchanging job-related information; and (d) attention to devices. Occupations identified with high scores on these job dimensions included transportation jobs (air traffic controllers, airline pilots and attendants, bus drivers, locomotive engineers, truck drivers), teachers (preschool, adult education), and craftsmen/foremen (machinists, carpenters, and foremen). 
5	Pancreatic ascites: treatment by continuous somatostatin infusion. Two male patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse were admitted with pancreatic ascites (high concentration of amylase, raised protein concentration, no specific cytologic features). Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) confirmed gross ascites and inflammation of the pancreas in both patients, and a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas in one of them. Treatment with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and a H2-blocking agent was instituted and continued for 4 and 2 wk, respectively. Due to lack of improvement, somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h) was started. During the next few days, there was a rapid improvement of the clinical status, and the production of ascites ceased. We conclude that somatostatin infusion should be tried before any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in patients with pancreatic ascites. 
3	Recurrence of acoustic neurilemoma as a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm. Case report. A 75-year-old man presented with a right cerebellopontine angle tumor 11 months after complete macroscopic resection of a right acoustic neurilemoma. Histological examination of the recurrent tumor showed a malignant spindle-cell neoplasm with positive staining for S-100 protein. The patient had no stigmata of von Recklinghausen's disease. It is proposed that this recurrence represents progression from a benign to a malignant acoustic nerve-sheath tumor, an event that is extremely rare outside the clinicopathological context of neurofibromatosis. 
1	Increased expression of the multidrug-resistance gene in undifferentiated sarcoma. We analyzed multidrug-resistance gene (mdr1 gene) expression in a patient with undifferentiated sarcoma of the liver using the cloned cDNA for the mdr1 gene. Tissue samples were available at the time of initial diagnosis and of two intracranial relapses after chemotherapy with a regimen including doxorubicin and teniposide. The level of mdr1 gene expression was increased sevenfold in the intracranial tumor at the time of first relapse and 11-fold at the second relapse. This case may be an example of acquired multidrug resistance associated with overexpression of the mdr1 gene. 
5	Acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis. Six patients with evidence of secondary syphilis presented with visual loss in both eyes caused by large, placoid, yellowish lesions with faded centers at the level of the pigment epithelium in the macula and juxtapapillary areas. All eyes had vitreitis. All of the lesions showed a similar fluorescein angiographic pattern of early hypofluorescence and late staining. Five patients had mucocutaneous lesions typical of secondary syphilis. All five patients treated with antibiotics had prompt improvement in visual function and resolution of the fundus lesions. The ophthalmoscopic and angiographic appearance of these posterior fundus lesions was sufficiently characteristic to suggest a diagnosis of secondary syphilis. Modification of the host response to syphilis by human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection may be partly responsible for this peculiar fundus picture. Three of the four patients tested positive for HIV. 
2	Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is an extremely rare entity. Because of its unusual clinical presentation and confusing histologic picture, a diagnosis of malignancy is frequently made. Thus the surgeon is closely involved with the case and extensive procedures are not uncommon. However, this lesion is benign and will even regress spontaneously, making radical surgical procedures contraindicated. The difficulty lies in establishing an accurate diagnosis and the histologic pitfalls of this particular process. Conservative therapy can then be applied, avoiding surgical morbidity. 
1	DNA flow cytometry of colorectal carcinoma: correlation of DNA stemlines with other prognostic indices. DNA flow cytometry (FCM) was performed on paraffin-embedded tissue blocks of 38 surgically resected colorectal carcinomas (CRC). Forty-seven percent of tumors exhibited aneuploidy and 53% were diploid. Seventy-two percent of patients in the aneuploid but only 35% in the diploid group were alive after a mean follow-up of 30.7 and 28.8 months (p = 0.01), and 5-yr survival of 56.7% and 11.7%, respectively (p less than 0.05). The site of tumor location, Dukes' stage, and serum CEA level did not predict a certain DNA stemline. However, irrespective of the ploidy pattern, a serum CEA level greater than 5.0 was associated with a higher mortality and poor 5-yr survival (p less than 0.005). Similarly, advanced Dukes' stage was associated with higher mortality (p less than 0.05). Forty-six percent of the patients with lesions that were Dukes' B2 or advanced stage received adjuvant therapy. Eighty-five percent of this subgroup of patients died; 18% of these patients had aneuploid tumors. The role of FCM in the assessment of prognosis of CRC deserves further clinical evaluation in a randomized control trial. 
3	Misperceptions of comprehension difficulties of stroke patients by doctors, nurses and relatives. Doctors, nurses and relatives involved with 30 recently aphasic stroke patients were asked to predict how the patient would perform on a comprehension test. Results show that not only do doctors, nurses and relatives underestimate the receptive disability of these patients, but they also illustrate a lack of agreement between health professionals. Implications for management are considered. 
4	Elective resection of 332 abdominal aortic aneurysms in a southern West Virginia community during a recent five-year period. This study analyzed 33 variables that might potentially affect outcome in a series of 332 consecutive elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repairs in a southern West Virginia community. One of the interesting features of this series was that the repairs were done by 22 surgeons with varying degrees of experience. The mortality and complication rates were compared for various potential risk factors by both univariant methods (chi 2, Fisher's exact, and Student t tests) and multivariant methods of analysis. Our early mortality (2.1%) and postoperative complication rates were consistent with those of other series. With multiple linear regression models, five factors were selected as significant independent risk factors associated with an increasing number of postoperative complications: the number of blood transfusions (p less than 0.0001), left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.0001), the presence of greater than 50% renal artery stenosis (p = 0.0012), the lesser experience of the surgeon (p = 0.0203), and the history of prior cardiac catheterization (p = 0.0245). The only factor statistically correlated with mortality rate was an increased number of postoperative complications (p less than 0.0001). Neither postoperative complications nor mortality rate was found to be significant and independently influenced by other demographic, clinical, or operative factors. It is tempting to speculate that surgeons with less experience might be well served to refer patients with significant renal artery stenosis and coronary artery disease. Our mortality and complication rates were not increased by performing preoperative angiography and therefore prudent surgeons may find this helpful in selecting patients for safer repair. 
2	Fibronectin-related substance located in the chief cells of human and rat gastric mucosa. A novel substance located in the chief cells of human and rat gastric mucosa, which was detected immunologically by either polyclonal or monoclonal antihuman fibronectin (FN) antibodies, is reported. All three polyclonal antihuman FN antibodies used in this study reacted immunohistologically exclusively with the chief cells. Monoclonal antibody against C-terminal peptide or cell binding peptide reacted clearly with the human chief cells, but monoclonal antibodies against FN N-terminal and midmolecule failed to react with the cells. Western blot analysis of the rat gastric mucosal extract with polyclonal antihuman FN antibody showed that this substance has a molecular weight of about 70,000 Da. Therefore, this substance appears to be a fragment containing the C-terminal peptide of whole molecule FN and thus in the present study is named FN-related substance (FNRS). In a further study with ethanol-induced ulcer model of the rat, the physiological significance of FNRS was examined. The FNRS decreased remarkably, in a dose-dependent manner, in the fundic mucosa of the rats that ingested ethanol. The FNRS appeared to be associated with development of mucosal damage and repair, subsequently playing, in part, an important role in the gastric mucosal protection mechanism. 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging in neurological disorders. To investigate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neurological disorders, 115 children were studied in two groups. Group A (78 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography and MRI cranial scans. Group B (37 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography assisted myelography (CTM) and MRI spinal scans. In group A, the scans were generally equivalent for supratentorial tumours and for investigating fits, hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension, and cerebral atrophies, but MRI scanning was superior for posterior fossa tumours and cysts. In group B, MRI scans were superior for intramedullary spinal tumours, spinal dysraphic problems with tethering or syrinx, and were complementary to CTM in diastematomyelia. 
1	Inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor growth in the brain. Suppression of endothelial cell turnover by penicillamine and the depletion of copper, an angiogenic cofactor. Microvascular proliferation, a hallmark of malignant brain tumors, represents an attractive target of anticancer research, especially because of the quiescent nonproliferative endothelium of the normal brain. Cerebral neoplasms sequester copper, a trace metal that modulates angiogenesis. Using a rabbit brain tumor model, normocupremic animals developed large vascularized VX2 carcinomas. By contrast, small, circumscribed, relatively avascular tumors were found in the brains of rabbits copper-depleted by diet and penicillamine treatment (CDPT). The CDPT rabbits showed a significant decrease in serum copper, copper staining of tumor cell nuclei, microvascular density, the tumor volume, endothelial cell turnover, and an increase in the vascular permeability (breakdown of the blood-brain barrier), as well as peritumoral brain edema. In non-tumor-bearing animals, CDPT did not alter the vascular permeability or the brain water content. CDPT also inhibited the intracerebral growth of the 9L gliosarcoma in F-344 rats, with a similar increase of the peritumoral vascular permeability and the brain water content. CDPT failed to inhibit tumor growth and the vascularization of the VX2 carcinoma in the thigh muscle or the metastases to the lung, findings that may reflect regional differences in the responsiveness of the endothelium, the distribution of copper, or the activity of cuproenzymes. Metabolic and pharmacologic withdrawal of copper suppresses intracerebral tumor angiogenesis; angiosuppression is a novel biologic response modifier for the in situ control of tumor growth in the brain. 
3	Problems and solutions of pedicle screw plate fixation of lumbar spine. Fifty-seven patients with low back pain and sciatica of various causes were reviewed with reference to problems associated with pedicle plate fixation of the lumbar spine. Eleven percent of patients had neurologic problems postoperatively and 3.5% (two patients) had severe sensory impairments. All patients had this complication in the early phases of the study. Of 297 screws, 17 broke, ie, 5.7%. These breakages occurred in 12 of 57 patients (21%). In patients with spondylolisthesis, the degree of slip correction averaged 53% postoperatively, which decreased to 35% at the 1-year follow-up. Slip angle was maintained after correction. Pedicle screw plate fixation is an effective form of immobilization of the lumbar spine used in achieving arthrodesis. The surgeon must be fully trained in methodology. It is recommended that screw and plate materials be improved to prevent screw breakage. 
1	Relationship of 4F2 antigen with local growth and metastatic potential of squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx. The 4F2 antigen is a cell-membrane glycoprotein which arises early in the G0-G1 phases of the cell cycle. This molecule is present in all established human cell lines and most malignant human cells. The authors used an indirect immunophosphatase method to study 50 squamous cell carcinomas of the larynx and ten lymph-node metastases, corresponding to six primary tumors, for 4F2 expression. The tumors showed several patterns of 4F2 staining which were correlated with different behaviors and prognoses of the neoplasms. Three different patterns (no staining, peripheral staining, and diffuse 4F2 expression) are described as are their relationships with metastatic behavior of the carcinomas. Tumors with metastases were found only in the third group (P = 0.0001). These results led to the following conclusions: (1) the 4F2 antigen is present in squamous cell carcinomas; (2) its distribution reflects the tumor-spreading pattern; and (3) it correlates with differentiation and metastatic behavior. 
5	Pneumococcal anticapsular antibodies in patients with chronic cardiovascular and obstructive lung disease in The Netherlands. Differences in pneumococcal anticapsular antibody concentrations were assessed among patients with various chronic disorders and among young (25-35 years of age) and older adults (55-65 years). Antibody concentrations were determined by ELISA, using the whole 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine as antigen. No differences in mean or distribution of serum antibody concentrations were found among young adults (either healthy or asthmatic) or among older adults (healthy or with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease). Each group included individuals with low antibody levels. Therefore, the enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal infections reported for some groups at risk, that is, elderly individuals and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary or chronic cardiovascular disease, cannot be attributed solely to low anticapsular antibody concentrations. 
5	Injection or heat probe for bleeding ulcer. A prospective randomized trial was performed to compare the efficacy of endoscopic epinephrine injection and heat probe treatment in actively bleeding peptic ulcers. Emergency endoscopy in 1758 patients over an 18-month period identified 132 patients with active ulcer bleeding. They were randomized to receive either endoscopic epinephrine injection or heat probe treatment. After endoscopy, the patients were transferred to the surgical gastroenterology ward and were managed by surgeons unaware of the treatment option. Bleeding was initially controlled in 96% by epinephrine injection and in 83% by heat probe (P less than 0.05). There was no significant difference in outcome as measured by transfusion requirement (4.5 units vs. 3.8 units), emergency surgery (20% vs. 22%), hospital stay (8 days vs. 7 days), and mortality (2 vs. 4) between the injection group and the heat probe group. Two patients in the heat probe group experienced perforation. We conclude that both endoscopic epinephrine injection and heat probe treatment are effective in stopping bleeding from actively bleeding ulcers. Epinephrine injection is technically easier to perform and has a higher initial success rate. 
1	Severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption. A severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption is described. Data are presented to show a significant absorption of lidocaine through diseased skin when lidocaine cream is used as a local anesthetic. Awareness of this route of intoxication might be important in patients in whom neurologic or psychiatric symptoms develop while large amounts of lidocaine cream are being used. 
1	Pleomorphic adenoma in the periphery of the lung. Report of a case and review of the literature. A pleomorphic adenoma of the lung recurred after 9 years. The primary tumor consisted mainly of cartilaginous and fibrous elements with a small area of epithelial cell nests, whereas the second one possessed epithelial cell nests with cartilaginous stroma. Immunohistochemical studies showed that both tumors had neoplastic cells with immunoreactive S100, keratin, actin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acid protein-positive cytoplasm. The primary tumor, which was resected from the periphery of the lung, was not connected with the trachea or the bronchus macroscopically. To our knowledge, the literature contains only six reports of pleomorphic adenoma in the lung. 
5	Achalasia in the elderly. Effects of aging on clinical presentation and outcome. Clinical and manometric data from 13 elderly subjects with idiopathic achalasia (mean age 79 +/- 2 years) were compared with findings from younger subjects with the same disease (n = 79) to see if aging altered the presentation and outcome of this motor disorder. Fewer elderly subjects complained of chest pain (27% vs 53%), and the pain was significantly less severe (P less than 0.01). Other presenting features (including sex, duration of symptoms, and presence and severity of dysphagia) did not differ between the groups. Across all patients, age weakly and inversely correlated with residual postdeglutitive lower esophageal sphincter; (LES) pressure (R = -0.34), and residual pressure was significantly lower in the older subjects (8.0 +/- 1.3 mm Hg vs. 11.9 +/- 0.8 mm Hg; P = 0.02). No differences in basal LES pressure or esophageal-body contraction amplitudes were present between the groups. Initial success with pneumatic dilation was similar in the two subject groups, but the number of older subjects available for analysis was too small to draw strong conclusions. These results indicate that aging decreases the elevation of LES residual pressure that occurs with achalasia. As elderly achalasia patients also present with less chest pain, the findings may be interrelated. 
5	The effect of flunarizine on essential tremor. We investigated the effect of flunarizine treatment (10 mg/d) in 17 subjects with essential tremor in a double-blind placebo-controlled design. Tremor was assessed by clinical scoring, tremographic recordings, and subjective rating by subjects. Of the 15 subjects who completed the study, 13 showed improvement. We conclude that flunarizine is effective treatment for essential tremor. 
4	Short-term effect of hepatic arterial versus portal venous reperfusion on energy levels of liver tissue. The hepatic artery and the portal vein blood vary in flow, oxygenation, and hormonal content. It was uncertain which blood supply has a greater effect on the recuperative process of the hepatocytes in the ischemic liver during the initial reperfusion. The ability of the liver cells to restore its energy phosphates is related to the viability of the liver. This study was designed to determine the differences of the high energy phosphate in the liver predicated upon whether reflow was first provided by either the hepatic artery or the portal vein followed by subsequent reperfusion from both vessels. The recovery of ATP upon 10 min of only hepatic arterial reperfusion after 15 min of total ischemia was much slower compared to the portal venous reperfusion only. It may be undesirable, therefore, to reperfuse the liver with hepatic arterial blood first immediately after warm liver ischemia. 
2	Elective resection for diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon. From 1966 to 1987, 177 consecutive patients were operated on electively for diverticular disease of the sigmoid colon. The indications for surgery were: colovesical fistula (n = 12), suspicion of residual abscess (n = 39), two or more previous attacks of acute inflammation (n = 52), chronic symptoms (n = 72) and suspicion of carcinoma (n = 2). An abscess was found at operation in 76 patients (43 per cent) and this was extracolic with local peritonitis in 52 patients (29 per cent). An unsuspected abscess was found in 25 of the 72 patients operated on for chronic symptoms. Colonic resection with primary anastomosis was performed in 95 per cent of the 177 patients and in 94 per cent of those 52 patients with an extracolic abscess. There were no postoperative deaths and no clinical anastomotic leakages. Long-term results were very good in 85 per cent of the 177 patients and in 82 per cent of the 72 patients operated on for chronic symptoms. The results of this series suggest that a one-stage procedure can be safely performed with some technical precautions in most patients operated on electively for diverticular disease, even if an extracolic abscess is found. The good long-term results in patients operated on for chronic symptoms suggest that such symptoms should be taken into account with respect to surgical indications. 
3	Penetrating craniocerebral trauma. The authors review the pathophysiology of penetrating and perforating cranial wounds. Radiologic evaluation includes computed tomography and angiography. Operative technique and perioperative critical care are discussed, with special emphasis on the control of the intracranial pressure. Other problems such as fluid and electrolyte disorders and nutrition are discussed in relation to neurosurgery. 
1	Results of transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas and Rathke's cysts. Fourteen patients undergoing transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas or Rathke's cysts underwent endocrinological evaluation before and after surgery. One patient died during the procedure because of uncontrollable arterial bleeding. The other patients were followed for up to 16 years (average, 8.5 years). One patient had recurrence of tumor 12 years after surgery. Another patient, the only one operated on because of a recurrent craniopharyngioma after previous radiation therapy, died 2 years after the transsphenoidal operation. No patient recovered pituitary functions that had been lost before surgery. One patient, who had an isolated growth hormone deficiency, and another, who had panhypopituitarism with sustained antidiuretic hormone secretion, had no change postoperatively from their preoperative endocrine status. The other 11 patients lost pituitary function and required pharmacological replacement of one to four pituitary hormones. 
5	Duodenogastric reflux and gastric histology after cholecystectomy with or without sphincteroplasty. Sixteen patients who had undergone cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty, 14 cholecystectomized patients and ten control patients were studied to evaluate whether differences existed in duodenogastric reflux and whether these were related to morphological damage of the gastric mucosa. Duodenogastric bile reflux during fasting was evaluated by measuring the concentration of total bile acids (by an enzymatic method) and single bile acids in the gastric juice by high performance liquid chromatography. The damage was evaluated histologically by systematic endoscopic biopsy of the antrum and body of the stomach. There was a statistically significant difference in fasting bile reflux between the three groups (Kruskal-Wallis test, P less than 0.001), and the group that underwent cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty had a significantly higher median value than the cholecystectomized group (P less than 0.05) and the control group (P less than 0.01). The distribution of chronic antral atrophic and superficial gastritis was different in the three groups (chi 2 test, P less than 0.005). Chronic atrophic gastritis was associated with cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty (P less than 0.01), while chronic superficial gastritis was more frequent in cholecystectomized patients. These results suggest that there may be more duodenogastric reflux after cholecystectomy plus sphincteroplasty than after cholecystectomy alone, and that there may be a correlation between the amount of duodenogastric reflux and the severity of mucosal damage. 
4	Effects of hydralazine and prostaglandin E1 on regional myocardial function in the ischemic canine heart. The effects of hydralazine and prostaglandin E1 on regional myocardial function were studied in dogs. Sixteen dogs were randomly assigned to one of two drug treatment groups of eight dogs each. The first group (G1) was treated with 0.4 mg/kg hydralazine administered as a bolus. The second group (G2) received prostaglandin E1 given as an infusion for a total dose of 0.8 micrograms/kg. Regional myocardial function was assessed through the measurement of myocardial segment shortening during systole. We call this index percent systolic shortening (%SS). An ischemic heart preparation was created by partial occlusion of coronary blood flow. The degree of induced ischemia was determined by following the reduction in %SS. Hydralazine reduced %SS of the ischemic myocardium while increasing the cardiac index, stroke volume index, and coronary blood flow. Prostaglandin E1 increased %SS, cardiac index, and stroke volume index in the ischemic heart preparation. Hydralazine, therefore, induced dissociation between global ventricular function and regional myocardial function whereas prostaglandin E1 did not. The present findings emphasize that evaluation of vasoactive drugs should consider their effects on regional myocardial function as well as on global hemodynamics. 
4	Medical management of congestive heart failure. The syndrome of congestive heart failure can result from a variety of cardiac disorders of which left ventricular dysfunction is the most common. The clinical presentation is determined by the interaction between cardiac dysfunction and a series of compensatory mechanisms that are activated throughout the body. Therapy for this disorder is best approached through an understanding of this complex relationship and an appreciation for the influence of preload, afterload, and contractility on cardiac performance. Recent important advances in therapy include the use of combined diuretic therapy, a better understanding of the value of the digitalis glycosides, and evidence that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors can relieve symptoms and prolong life. More intensive therapy earlier in the course of congestive heart failure appears to have some clinical benefit. The use of ACE inhibitors during this phase may delay progression of the underlying left ventricular dysfunction. Future therapy will be influenced by the results of ongoing trials that are testing both new agents and expanded indications for drugs that are currently available. 
5	Kidney transplantation in patients aged sixty years and older. Outcomes of renal transplantation were reviewed for 26 transplants performed in 25 patients 60 years of age or older between 1985 and 1989. Three grafts were from family donors and 23 were from cadaver donors. Twenty-one were first transplants and five were retransplants. Cyclosporine was used as primary immunosuppression and azathioprine and prednisone were administered to most patients. Overall patient and graft actuarial survival rates were 79% and 71%, respectively, at both 1 and 3 years. Patients (n = 14) free of both diabetes and cardiac disease (low risk) had 1- and 3-year patient and graft survival rates of 91% and 84%, respectively. Conversely, high-risk patients (n = 12) had patient and graft survival rates at 1 and 3 years of 67% and 58%, respectively. Early deaths (less than or equal to 6 months) were caused by sepsis (two patients) or cardiac events (three patients), and four of the five were in high-risk patients. Irreversible rejections and serious infectious complications were not as common as steroid-induced diabetes, which occurred in five patients. This experience suggests that kidney transplantation can be done safely and successfully in patients older than 60 years of age and should be the treatment of choice for low-risk patients in this category. 
1	Clinical problems in follow-up of patients after conservative surgery and radiotherapy. Patients treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy for early-stage breast carcinoma are at risk of developing an ipsilateral breast recurrence for a long period. Fortunately, few such patients present with an inoperable recurrence or simultaneous distant metastases. Salvage rates are high and may be improved by early detection. Although usually unambiguous, physical examination of the treated breast may reveal changes attributable to surgery and radiotherapy that can mimic a recurrent cancer. There also is substantial overlap in radiologic appearance between benign and malignant lesions. It may be necessary to perform a biopsy when there is a question of recurrence. Careful life-long follow-up of patients thus is a critical part of their care. 
5	A prospective study of aspirin's effect on red blood cell loss in cardiac surgery. The effect of aspirin on red blood cell (RBC) loss and blood transfusions was evaluated prospectively in 100 consecutive patients, with normal bleeding times, undergoing elective coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery. Patients taking 85-325 mgm of aspirin daily up to or within 48 hours of surgery (the "aspirin" group) were compared to patients not taking aspirin or those who had discontinued aspirin at least 4 days before surgery (the "no-aspirin" group). RBC loss was determined by measuring preoperative and postoperative RBC volume using RISA and 51Cr techniques. There were no significant differences, respectively, between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups for: RBC loss (1158 +/- 67 ml vs 1129 +/- 47 ml, p = 0.737), chest tube drainage (925 +/- 31 ml vs 844 +/- 70 ml, p = 0.553), and gm% discharge Hemoglobin (Hgb) (9.94 +/- 0.32 vs 9.49 +/- 1.4, p = 0.0148). Strict criteria for blood transfusions were employed: (1) intraoperative hematocrit of less than 21%, (2) postoperative Hgb of less than 7 gm% for patients less than 70 years old and (3) postoperative Hgb of less than 8 gm% for patients greater than 70 years old. There were no significant differences, respectively, between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups for units of blood transfused (1.32 +/- vs 1.21 +/- 0.20, p = 0.843) and patients not receiving transfusions during the entire hospitalization (44% vs 50%). Patients taking 85-325 mgm of aspirin with a normal bleeding time undergoing elective CABG did not have increased RBC loss or increased transfusion requirements. These results indicate it is not necessary to delay elective CABG surgery for the purpose of discontinuing aspirin. 
5	Ocular pathologic features of arteriohepatic dysplasia (Alagille's syndrome). Arteriohepatic dysplasia (Alagille's syndrome), an autosomal dominant condition involving jaundice caused by a developmental scarcity of intrahepatic bile ducts, has characteristic cardiovascular, skeletal, facial, and ocular features that distinguish it from extrahepatic biliary atresia and an array of other neonatal intrahepatic cholestatic disorders. Two children who died of this syndrome had prominent Schwalbe's rings with attached iris strands characteristic of Axenfeld's syndrome. Additional histologic findings of iris atrophy and stromal nodules, however, made the designation Axenfeld-Reiger's syndrome more appropriate. Pigmentary retinopathy, degeneration of Bruch's membrane, and prominent lipofuscin deposition in the ciliary muscle noted in one of the patients were not regarded as primary changes of Alagille's syndrome, but were believed to be secondary to acquired deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins A and E. Early recognition of the ocular changes in arteriohepatic dysplasia is helpful in establishing the proper diagnosis to avoid unnecessary abdominal surgery and institute vitamin therapy. 
5	Clue cells in predicting infections after abdominal hysterectomy. Seventy women scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy were examined for the presence of clue cells in the vaginal discharge in an attempt to identify a possible risk group for development of postoperative infection. Seven of 20 women (35%) with clue cells developed vaginal cuff infections or wound infections, compared with four of 50 women (8%) without clue cells (P less than .01). Women with bacterial vaginosis, diagnosed by air-dried vaginal smears, are therefore at risk for postoperative infection. 
5	The recalcitrant perineal wound after rectal extirpation. Applications of muscle flap closure. Perineal wounds developing after abdominoperineal resection result in chronic purulent drainage and intermittent episodes of sepsis and are generally unresponsive to conservative medical and surgical treatment. Thirteen consecutive patients (aged 27 to 74 years; mean, 48 years) who underwent debridement and immediate muscle flap closure of these wounds were analyzed to identify risk factors for delayed healing and to evaluate the effectiveness of muscle flap coverage. Three risk factors were identified: preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy, resection for recurrent carcinoma, and inflammatory bowel disease. A total of 19 muscle flaps (11 gracilis, five gluteal thigh, two gluteus maximus, and one rectus abdominis) were used to close these wounds. During an average 3.5-year follow-up, four (31%) minor complications and one (8%) recurrence were noted to occur. Muscle flaps provide safe, effective, single-stage procedures for the closure of chronic perineal wounds. 
2	Preliminary report: the antegrade continence enema. The principles of antegrade colonic washout and the Mitrofanoff non-refluxing catheterisable channel were combined to produce a continent catheterisable colonic stoma. The intention was that antegrade washouts delivered by this route would produce complete colonic emptying and thereby prevent soiling. The procedure has been successfully carried out in five patients with intractable faecal incontinence. 
4	Relative accuracy of three scintigraphic methods for determination of right ventricular ejection fraction: a correlative study with ultrafast computed tomography. The accuracy of three scintigraphic methods for determination of right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was tested in 29 patients using ultrafast computed tomography (UFCT) as the gold standard. RVEF measurements by the ECG-gated first-pass approach showed excellent correlation with the UFCT results (r = 0.96, y = 0.06 + 0.91x), while both the standard gated acquisition blood-pool imaging (r = 0.71, y = 0.14 + 0.59x) and the nongated first-pass curve approach (r = 0.63, y = 0.18 + 0.37x) significantly underestimated RVEF. The error can be ascribed to partial inclusion of the atrial activity in the region assigned to the right ventricle. The tricuspid valve plane was found to move by a distance equal to 9%-33% (mean = 20%) of the right ventricular long-axis between systole and diastole. This translational motion was more pronounced with higher EFs. 
4	Estrogen replacement and coronary artery disease. Effect on survival in postmenopausal women. The relationship among postmenopausal estrogen use, coronary stenosis, and survival was examined retrospectively in 2268 women undergoing coronary angiography. The patients were selected for study if their age was 55 years or older at the time of angiography or if they had previously undergone bilateral oophorectomy. Postmenopausal estrogen use in 1178 patients with coronary artery disease (greater than 70% stenosis) and 644 patients with mild to moderate coronary artery disease (5% to 69% stenosis) was compared with 446 control subjects (0% stenosis) using life-table analysis. Over 10 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in survival among patients initially free of coronary lesions on arteriography who had either never used (377) or ever used (69) estrogens. Among patients with mild to moderate coronary stenosis, 10-year survival of those who had never used estrogens was 85.0% and it was 95.6% among 99 "ever users." Survival was 60.0% among those with more than 70% coronary stenosis who had never used estrogen and it was 97.0% among 70 ever users. The "never users" group were older (65 vs 59 years), had a lower proportion of cigarette smokers (40% vs 57.1%), a higher proportion of subjects with diabetes (21.7% vs 12.9%) and hyperlipidemia (58% vs 44%), and approximately equal numbers of hypertensives (56.0% vs 54.3%). Cox's proportional hazards model was used to estimate survival as a function of multiple covariables. Estrogen use was found to have a significant, independent effect on survival in women. We conclude that estrogen replacement after menopause prolongs survival when coronary artery disease is present, but it has less effect in the absence of coronary artery disease. 
5	Patient-controlled analgesia in children. We report our experience in introducing patient-controlled analgesia at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow. Twenty-five children used the technique after orthopaedic or general surgery using the Graseby system. The pump was loaded with 1 mg/kg morphine sulphate in 50 ml. A bolus dose of 0.02 mg/kg (1 ml) and a lockout interval of 10 minutes were the initial settings. The dose used, pain and sedation scores, respiratory rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded. Ages ranged from 5-15 years (mean 9.6) and the method was used for a mean of 48 hours after operation. Morphine requirements averaged 26 (micrograms/kg)/hour (SD 10.6). Pain control was good and sedation minimal. Adverse effects were few and minor. Education of patients, parents and nurses is essential for its success and safety. The technique is an effective and safe means of providing good quality analgesia in school age children. 
4	Intermittent claudication, heart disease risk factors, and mortality. The Whitehall Study In the Whitehall study, 18,388 subjects aged 40-64 years completed a questionnaire on intermittent claudication. Of these subjects, 0.8% (147) and 1% (175) were deemed to have probable intermittent claudication and possible intermittent claudication, respectively. Within the 17-year follow-up period, 38% and 40% of the probable and possible cases, respectively, died. Compared with subjects without claudication, the probable cases suffered increased mortality rates due to coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, but the mortality rate due to noncardiovascular causes was not increased. Possible cases demonstrated increased mortality rates due to cardiovascular and noncardiovascular causes. This difference in mortality pattern may be due to chance. Possible and probable cases still showed increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality rates after adjusting for coronary risk factors (cardiac ischemia at baseline, systolic blood pressure, plasma cholesterol concentration, smoking behavior, employment grade, and degree of glucose intolerance). Intermittent claudication is independently related to increased mortality rates. It is not a rare condition, and simple questionnaires exist for its detection. The latter can be usefully incorporated in cardiovascular risk assessment and screening programs. 
4	Predictors of long-term cardiac survival in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The predictors of 5-year cardiac survival in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were analyzed in a series of 637 consecutive patients. The average age was 59 +/- 11 years in 472 men and 165 women. Diabetes mellitus, previous myocardial infarction and unstable angina were present in 119 (19%), 261 (41%) and 305 (47%) patients, respectively. Angiographically, 460 patients had 2-vessel and 177 patients had 3-vessel CAD. The left ventricular contraction score was greater than or equal to 12 in 55 patients. Angiographic success (less than 50% residual stenosis) was achieved in 85% of the 1,343 narrowings and clinical success was obtained in 526 (83%) of the 637 patients. Complete revascularization was obtained in 177 (34%) of 526 successful patients. Procedure-related complications resulted in death in 9 patients (1.4%), in Q-wave myocardial infarction only in 6 patients (0.9%) and in emergency bypass surgery in 44 patients (6.9%) (of whom 10 had Q-wave myocardial infarction). Follow-up for greater than or equal to 1 year and up to 6 years after PTCA was obtained in 608 (95%) of the 637 patients. To determine the predictors of 5-year cardiac survival, 28 clinical, angiographic and procedural variables were analyzed by Cox proportional-hazards regression. The estimated 5-year survival after PTCA was 88 +/- 2% in successful patients and 77 +/- 5% in patients in whom PTCA was unsuccessful (p less than 0.001). When clinical success was forced into the Cox regression, the left ventricular contraction score of greater than or equal to 12, diabetes mellitus and age greater than or equal to 65 years showed additional adverse effects on survival. 
4	Cardiorespiratory effects of antagonism of diazepam sedation with flumazenil in patients with cardiac disease. The specific benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil is currently under intense study. Despite much clinical experience, no detailed invasive hemodynamic studies of its use in cardiac patients have been published. In the present study, hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured in 10 cardiac patients undergoing catheterization of the right and left sides of the heart, before and after sedation with intravenous diazepam, and after reversal of sedation with flumazenil. A sleep dose of diazepam (12.2 +/- 5.1 mg, mean +/- SD) caused only slight decreases in mean arterial pressure (103 +/- 12 to 98 +/- 14 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (13.2 +/- 6.3 to 11.7 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (20.8 +/- 7.5 to 17.3 +/- 10.0 mm Hg; P less than 0.05), with no significant changes in respiratory gas homeostasis. Intravenous flumazenil (0.22 +/- 0.07 mg) resulted in spontaneous awakening and return to full orientation, yet caused no significant alteration in either hemodynamic or respiratory variables measured. Reversal of diazepam-induced sedation by flumazenil in cardiac patients appears safe and effective. 
2	Pivoting larynx--an unusual clinical observation at laryngoscopy. Rigid oesophagoscopy was planned in the investigation of a young patient with dysphagia. During laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation an unusual pivoting manoeuvre was required to see the vocal cords. Although the initial diagnostic investigations were unhelpful, follow up directed at explaining the clinical observations led to an eventual diagnosis of anterior tubercles of C6, which explained the observation and accounted for the dysphagia. 
3	Effect of sleep and sleep deprivation on ventilatory response to bronchoconstriction. To characterize ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction during sleep and to assess the effect of prior sleep deprivation on ventilatory and arousal responses to bronchoconstriction, bronchoconstriction was induced in eight asthmatic subjects while they were awake, during normal sleep, and during sleep after a 36-h period of sleep deprivation. Each subject was bronchoconstricted with increasing concentrations of aerosolized methacholine while ventilatory patterns and lower airway resistance (Rla) were continually monitored. The asthmatic patients maintained their minute ventilation as Rla increased under all conditions, demonstrating a stable tidal volume with a mild increase in respiratory frequency. Inspiratory drive, as measured by occlusion pressure (P0.1), increased progressively and significantly as Rla increased under all conditions (slopes of P0.1 vs. Rla = 0.249, 0.112, and 0.154 for awake, normal sleep, and sleep after sleep deprivation, respectively, P less than 0.0006). Chemostimuli did not appear to contribute significantly to the observed increases in P0.1. Prior sleep deprivation had no effect on ventilatory and P0.1 responses to bronchoconstriction but did significantly raise the arousal threshold to induced bronchoconstriction. We conclude that ventilatory responses to bronchoconstriction, unlike extrinsic loading, are not imparied by the presence of sleep, nor are they chemically mediated. However, prior sleep deprivation does increase the subsequent arousal threshold. 
1	Angiotropic intravascular large-cell lymphoma (malignant angioendotheliomatosis): report of a case and review of the literature. We present a case of angiotropic large-cell lymphoma and review the literature in order to define the neurologic features of this rare disorder. This is the first report of gadolinium-DTPA imaging in angiotropic large-cell lymphoma that demonstrates infarcts of multiple ages, as well as striking meningeal enhancement. Angiotropic large-cell lymphoma should be suspected in patients with clinical evidence of small and large cerebral vessel disease and diagnosis requires skin, liver, renal, meningeal, or brain biopsy. Single modality treatment, using either radiation therapy or steroids, has been ineffective, and new findings of a lymphomatous origin of this neoplasm suggest that combination chemotherapy may be indicated. 
3	Fracture-dislocation of the base of the fifth metacarpal with an ulnar motor nerve lesion: case report. We report a case of delayed diagnosis of a fracture dislocation of the base of the fifth metacarpal with a resultant ulnar motor nerve lesion. The patient achieved marked improvement after fracture reduction and ulnar neurolysis. 
3	Relationship of clinical features with psychological status in primary fibromyalgia. Clinical features and psychological status determined by the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) in 103 patients with primary fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) were analyzed by univariate and multivariate techniques to determine if clinical features were related to psychological status or were intrinsic to PFS per se. The central features of PFS, e.g., number of pain sites, number of tender points, fatigue, and poor sleep, were independent of psychological status. However, discriminant analysis identified 4 variables--patient-reported depression, anxiety, stress, and pain severity--which together predicted 3 MMPI subgroups with an accuracy of 55% (P less than 0.001); the only musculoskeletal feature--pain severity--alone provided an accuracy of only 34% (P greater than 0.05). These data suggest a new concept, that the central features of fibromyalgia are independent of the psychological status and are more likely related to the PFS itself. However, pain severity may be influenced by psychological factors. 
4	Disappearance of renin-induced proteinuria by an ACE-inhibitor: a case report. A 55-year-old man developed renovascular hypertension that was characterized by high plasma renin activity. This was accompanied by nephrotic range proteinuria. Treatment with nifedipine and furosemide lowered the blood pressure to normal values, but proteinuria persisted. However, treatment with an ACE-inhibitor brought resolution of the proteinuria, suggesting a role for angiotensin II in urinary protein loss. 
2	Management of an extensive tracheoesophageal fistula by cervical esophageal exclusion. Giant tracheoesophageal fistulae occurring in ventilator-dependent patients usually result in significant ventilatory embarrassment. Cervical exclusion of the fistula can safely control the fistula and quickly restore adequate ventilation to these critically ill patients. 
5	Genetic mapping of "Lubag" (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism) in a Filipino kindred to the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome. "Lubag" is an X-linked disorder causing dystonia and parkinsonism that has only been described in families from the Philippines, principally from the island of Panay. We have established linkage between the disease phenotype "lubag" and DNA markers which span the Xp11.22-Xq21.3 region by using a large Filipino family with 8 affected men in three generations. These DNA markers define an interval of about 20 centimorgans in the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome as the most likely site of the disease locus XDPD (X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism). XDPD has a maximum multipoint log likelihood ratio score (Zmax) of about 4.6 over the interval from Xq12 to Xq21.31 (DXS159-DXYS1X). The co-occurrence of dystonia and parkinsonism in lubag and in other known disorders suggests there may be a common pathogenetic mechanism. Identification of the genetic defect in this family may provide an important clue toward understanding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of both dystonia and parkinsonism. 
1	Primary carcinoma of the gallbladder. Seventy-four patients with primary carcinoma of the gallbladder, diagnosed over 18 years from 1969 to 1987, were studied retrospectively. The most common presenting complaint was abdominal pain, followed by jaundice and weight loss. Surgery was performed in 61 patients and of these patients, only two had accurate preoperative diagnosis which was made by ultrasonography. Twelve of the 13 patients who were treated medically had the disease diagnosed at autopsy. One of the 13 patients had the diagnosis of gallbladder cancer by the findings of ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning. The resectability of the surgically managed group was 36.1%, and the majority of patients with advanced tumors (82.2%) were deemed unresectable. The most common histologic type was adenocarcinoma. Liver was the organ most commonly invaded (76.5%) by direct extension and/or metastases, followed by regional lymph nodes (52.9%). The overall 5-year survival rate was 5.4%. A high index of suspicion of the disease, intraoperative examination of gallbladder specimen, and earlier, more aggressive surgical treatment may improve patient survival. 
1	Postoperative ectopic craniopharyngioma. Case report. The case of an ectopic craniopharyngioma arising from a seed of tissue deposited along the operative track is reported. The uniqueness of this lesion is addressed. Ideal therapy and controversies regarding radiation therapy of craniopharyngiomas are discussed in light of this new variation in recurrence. 
5	Impaired sympathetic nerve function in the inflamed rat intestine. The effect of intestinal inflammation on norepinephrine release from the myenteric plexus in the Trichinella spiralis-infected rat was assessed. Longitudinal muscle-myenteric plexus preparations were preincubated with [3H]norepinephrine and release was evoked by electrical field stimulation and KCl administration. Preincubation of preparations with desipramine or pretreatment of rats with 6-hydroxydopamine significantly suppressed the uptake and evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine; electrical field stimulation but not KCl-evoked release of [3H] norepinephrine was sensitive to tetrodotoxin. These results confirm the presence of functioning sympathetic nerves in the preparations. T. spiralis infection was associated with significant suppression of both electrical field stimulation and KCl-evoked release of [3H]norepinephrine on the sixth day postinfection, and the suppression persisted 100 days postinfection. No suppression of [3H]norepinephrine release was seen in the worm-free and noninflamed ileum of infected rats. Suppression of [3H]norepinephrine release from the jejunum of infected rats was attenuated by treatment with betamethasone (3.0 mg/kg SC daily). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intestinal inflammation suppresses the release of norepinephrine from the myenteric plexus in the Trichinella-infected rat. 
5	Effect of electrocautery on wound healing in midline laparotomy incisions. The effect of electrocautery on midline fascial wound healing was studied in 108 Sprague-Dawley rats. Midline wound tensile strength was significantly reduced in fascia incised with the coagulation current compared with the cutting current or scalpel. In addition, tissue necrosis and inflammation as well as adhesion formation between the incision and abdominal viscera were more extensive in animals with incisions made using coagulation current. The results of the study indicate that the use of electrocautery coagulation current is associated with increased tissue damage and a significant reduction in the tensile strength of healing wounds. The contribution of electrocautery to wound complications in patients needs further evaluation. 
5	Comparison of outcomes of double and single lung transplantation for obstructive lung disease. The Toronto Lung Transplant Group. Single lung transplantation has recently been applied with success in patients with obstructive lung disease. Such patients were previously managed by bilateral pulmonary transplantation. Between November 1986 and January 1990, 18 patients underwent transplantation for obstructive lung disease in our center. Eleven double lung transplants and seven single lung transplants were performed in patients having a mean age of 43.4 and 44.1 years, respectively. Operative death occurred in two of 11 double lung transplantations and one of seven single lung transplantations. Each patient underwent preoperative and 3-month postoperative pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analyses, nuclear lung scans, and 6-minute walk tests. There was no difference in the preoperative values for any of these parameters. Double lung recipients had significantly higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity than single lung recipients. However, the ratios of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to vital capacity were not different. Arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension were not different between the two procedures. Whereas double lung transplantations caused a slight preponderance of perfusion to the right lung, the transplanted lung in single lung recipients received a mean of 79.5% +/- 12.3% of predicted flow and only 61.6% +/- 5.0% of predicted ventilation. Three-month 6-minute walk distances were markedly improved in both groups, with double lung recipients achieving 573.0 +/- 44.7 m in comparison with the 528.0 +/- 43.0 m achieved by the single lung recipients. Single lung transplantation is a satisfactory option in patients with obstructive lung disease and might offer significant advantages to the older patient population, in which risk of double lung transplantation is high. 
1	Observations on the pathophysiology of Nelson's syndrome: a report of three cases. Nelson's syndrome is generally regarded as an unusual sequela of primary bilateral adrenalectomy when performed for Cushing's disease. It is classically defined by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, considerably elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, and an enlarged sella turcica. In this report, we present three cases initially treated by transsphenoidal sellar exploration for Cushing's disease. In two of these cases, remission of hypercortisolism did not occur after the initial pituitary exploration. A microadenomectomy was performed in one case and, in the other, no microadenoma was found. In both, Nelson's syndrome occurred after adrenalectomy. A second transsphenoidal operation and radiotherapy were required to control tumor growth. In another case, transsphenoidal adenomectomy of an ACTH-secreting tumor initially led to a remission of hypercortisolism for 4 years, but recurrent Cushing's disease necessitated adrenalectomy, and again Nelson's syndrome occurred. The documentation of a pre-existing ACTH-secreting basophilic pituitary microadenoma before adrenalectomy, as seen in two of our cases, has not been previously reported, and these observations of "non-classical" courses have major implications for the pathophysiology of Nelson's syndrome. 
5	Predictors of postextubation stridor in pediatric trauma patients. OBJECTIVE: To determine which factors are the best predictors of postextubation stridor in pediatric trauma patients. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Burn and Trauma ICUs at Harborview Medical Center from March to September 1989. PATIENTS: Children were eligible for the study if they were less than 15 yr old, were intubated for greater than 12 hr, and did not have underlying cardiopulmonary disease. The study included 25 patients with 30 extubations. RISK FACTORS ASSESSED: Age, type of injury (burn vs. trauma), location of intubation ("field" vs. hospital), endotracheal tube size, length of intubation, and presence of an airleak around the tube at the time of extubation at 30 cm H2O pressure. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Moderate to severe postextubation stridor requiring treatment with racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen, reintubation, or tracheostomy. RESULTS: Treatment for postextubation stridor was required after 11 (37%) of 30 extubations, with five reintubations and one tracheostomy. The best predictor of postextubation stridor was absence of an airleak at the time of extubation (sensitivity 100%, positive predictive value 79%, p less than .001), followed by type of injury (facial burn vs. all others; sensitivity 64%, positive predictive value 88%, p less than .001). After controlling for these two factors, no other factor studied was a significant predictor of postextubation stridor. CONCLUSION: In pediatric trauma patients, mechanism of injury (facial burn vs. other) and absence of an airleak at the time of extubation are the strongest factors predicting postextubation stridor. Patients with one or both risk factors require special attention to airway management. 
5	Sinistral (left-sided) portal hypertension. Between 1953 and 1988, 21 patients with splenic vein thrombosis (SVT), 12 of whom had sinistral portal hypertension (SPH) were treated at our institution. SVT was identified at autopsy in nine patients. Twelve additional patients presented with SPH: bleeding esophageal varices, SVT and normal hepatic function. SVT was caused by pancreatic neoplasm (5), chronic pancreatitis (5), and pancreatic pseudocyst (2). SVT was diagnosed by splanchnic angiography, splenoportography, computerized tomography, and ultrasonography. Gastric varices were diagnosed by endoscopy (10) and barium swallow (2). Splenectomy was performed as primary therapy in 10 patients. Three of these 10 had en block distal pancreatectomy. Two high-risk patients had splenic artery embolization, one as a prelude to splenectomy performed 48 hours later and the other as definitive therapy. One splenectomized patient continued to bleed. No further bleeding occurred in 10 splenectomized patients in follow-up from 1 week to 14 years. Sinistral portal hypertension is a clinical syndrome of splenic vein thrombosis caused by pancreatic pathology and manifests as bleeding gastric varices in patients with a patent portal vein and normal hepatic function. Splanchnic arteriography is necessary for accurate diagnosis. Splenectomy is the effective treatment of choice. 
5	Ventricular arrhythmias in ischemic heart disease. Ventricular arrhythmias remain the leading cause of death from coronary artery disease. This review summarizes current thinking in several areas relating to the pathophysiology, prognosis, and therapy of ventricular arrhythmias associated with acute and chronic coronary artery disease syndromes. The experimental basis of arrhythmias in the setting of acute myocardial ischemia and chronic myocardial infarction is described, stressing the important pathophysiologic differences between these two conditions. The effects of the autonomic nervous system as a key modulator of ischemic arrhythmogenesis are discussed. Insights, derived from endocardial mapping studies, into the nature of ventricular tachycardia in humans with chronic myocardial infarction are described, including implications for risk stratification and therapy to prevent arrhythmia recurrence. Current therapeutic principles are discussed in the management of ventricular arrhythmias associated with coronary artery disease, including pharmacologic approaches, surgical and catheter ablation, and automatic implantable cardioverting and defibrillating devices. 
3	An intracranial mass lesion in systemic xanthogranulomatosis: case report. The authors describe a 42-year-old woman with systemic xanthogranulomatosis and bilateral intraorbital tumors, who subsequently developed multiple lesions of the intracranial dura mater, spinal cord, retroperitoneum, pericardium, and mediastinum. Systemic xanthogranulomatosis is histologically similar to systemic Weber-Christian disease, except for the absence of subcutaneous panniculitis. Immunohistochemical studies suggest that this clinical entity can be differentiated from histiocytosis X, because foamy cells in systemic xanthogranulomatosis demonstrate macrophages but not T-zone histiocyte markers. Differentiation of this disease from other intracranial xanthogranulomas and treatment are discussed. 
5	Primary sarcomas of the major salivary glands. Sarcomas arising in the major salivary glands are rare. This article presents the clinicopathologic features of 11 patients with primary sarcomas of the parotid gland (eight men and three women aged 7 to 75 years; mean age, 42 years). The 11 sarcomas were histologically typified as follows: three malignant fibrous histiocytomas and two each of neurosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, and osteosarcomas. Four patients experienced disease recurrences, and seven patients developed metastases. Seven patients died of their sarcomas, with a mean survival time of 30 months. Four patients were alive from 5 to 12 years (one each with angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and neurosarcoma). Prognosis correlated with size of the neoplasm, type of sarcoma, and histologic grade. In this respect, salivary gland sarcomas behaved in identical fashion to their soft-tissue counterparts. 
4	Inverse correlation between plasma vitamin E and mortality from ischemic heart disease in cross-cultural epidemiology. Essential antioxidants were determined in plasma of middle-aged men representing 16 European study populations, which differed sixfold in age-specific mortality from ischemic heart disease (IHD). In 12 populations with "common" plasma cholesterol (5.7-6.2 mmol/L) and blood pressure, both classical risk factors lacked significant correlations to IHD mortality, whereas absolute levels of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) showed a strong inverse correlation (r2 = 0.63, P = 0.002). Evaluating all populations, cholesterol and diastolic blood pressure were moderately associated, but their correlation was inferior to that of vitamin E. In stepwise regression and multiple regression analysis, mortality was predictable to 62% by lipid-standardized vitamin E, to 79% by vitamin E and cholesterol, to 83% after inclusion of lipid-standardized vitamin A (retinol), and to 87% by all the above parameters plus blood pressure. Thus, in the present study the cross-cultural differences of IDH mortality are primarily attributable to plasma status of vitamin E, which might have protective functions. 
4	Myocardial metabolism of fluorodeoxyglucose compared to cell membrane integrity for the potassium analogue rubidium-82 for assessing infarct size in man by PET Potassium loss from damaged myocardial cells is linearly related to CPK enzyme loss reflecting extent of necrosis. The potassium analog, rubidium-82 (82Rb), is extracted after i.v. injection and retained in viable myocardium but is not trapped or washed out of necrotic regions. To compare myocardial cell metabolism with membrane dysfunction as indicators of necrosis/viability, 43 patients with evolving myocardial infarction and coronary arteriography had positron emission tomography using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and the potassium analog 82Rb. Percent of heart showing FDG defects and 82Rb washout on sequential images indicating failure to retain the potassium analogue were visually assessed and quantified by automated software. Infarct size based on rubidium kinetics correlated closely with size and location on FDG images (visual r = 0.93, automated r = 0.82), suggesting that loss of cell membrane integrity for trapping the potassium analog 82Rb parallels loss of intracellular glucose metabolism, both comparable quantitative markers of myocardial necrosis/viability. 
1	Failure of nutritional recovery after total gastrectomy. Malnutrition is reported to be an inevitable consequence of total gastrectomy, although there are few data to support this contention. Six patients of median age 63 years underwent total gastrectomy for malignancy. At follow-up (median 45 months, range 25-60 months) each patient was clinically tumour-free and underwent dietary assessment, faecal fat and nitrogen measurement and routine haematological testing. Protein and fat stores, measured by neutron activation analysis and the tritiated water dilution technique, were compared with the same measurements made before operation and with predicted values. Mean (s.d.) dietary intake (2224(381) kcal day-1 and 81(15)g protein day-1) met the patients' estimated requirements. Mean(s.d.) serum albumin and faecal nitrogen values were normal but there was notable steatorrhoea (21(17) g day-1). Body composition measurements revealed profound deficiencies of body-weight (P less than 0.02), protein (P less than 0.01) and fat (P less than 0.02) before operation which were not corrected by an apparently curative total gastrectomy (P less than 0.05), although further deterioration was prevented. 
5	Abnormalities of the long arm of chromosome 6 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To determine the biologic significance of the structural rearrangements of the long arm of chromosome 6(6q) in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis, we studied 412 consecutive children whose leukemic cell chromosomes had been completely banded and identified 45 (11%) children with this abnormality. The 45 cases were divided into del(6q) only (n = 11), del(6q) and numerical abnormalities (n = 4), del(6q) and structural abnormalities (n = 23), and 6q translocations (n = 7). The breakpoints of del(6q) were subgrouped: del(6)(q15q21) in 11 cases, del(6) (q13q21) in six, del(6)(q21q23) in four, del(6)(q15) in four, del(6)(q15q23) in three, and other deletions in 10 cases. Notably, all these deletions encompassed the 6q21 band, suggesting that this might be the locus of a recessive tumor suppressor gene, the absence of which contributes to malignant transformation or proliferation. Among the seven children with 6q translocations, a previously unidentified nonrandom translocation, t(6;12)(q21;p13) was noted in two cases with an early pre-B immunophenotype. Clinical features and event-free survival were similar among children with or without 6q abnormalities. Overall, children with 6q abnormalities were less likely than those without the abnormality to have a pre-B immunophenotype (P = .03). T-cell immunophenotypes were equally represented in cases with or without 6q abnormalities. However, all four children with del(6q) and a 12p abnormality had early pre-B ALL and all three children with del(6q) and a 9p abnormality had a T-cell immunophenotype. The lack of specificity for a particular immunophenotype may imply that the gene or genes affected by 6q abnormalities are broadly active in the multistep process of lymphoid leukemogenesis. The relatively high frequency of microscopically visible del(6q) indicates the need for molecular studies to identify cases with submicroscopic deletions. 
5	Large diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for infrarenal aortic aneurysm surgery. The performance of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft used for aortic aneurysm replacement was evaluated. ePTFE grafts were implanted in 241 patients undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. Sixty patients were operated as emergencies for aneurysm rupture and 181 electively. One hundred and fourteen bifurcated and 127 tube grafts were inserted. The transperitoneal approach was used in 64 cases and the remainder were placed using a retroperitoneal approach. There was a one-month mortality of 2.8% in elective and 20% in emergency cases. Median follow-up was 26 months. Specific graft complications included one infected graft resulting in a graft-enteric fistula. No graft rupture, degeneration, dilatation, pseudoaneurysm or late graft limb thromboses were observed in up to 7 years of follow-up. The aortic ePTFE prosthesis demonstrated satisfactory performance over the period studied. 
5	Cervical lymph nodes from an unknown primary tumor in 190 patients. Over 10 years, 475 patients with isolated lateral neck masses were evaluated: 190 with lymph nodes from an unknown primary tumor (LNUP), 188 with neck lymphomas, 78 with benign tumors, 10 with sarcomas, and 9 with chemodectomas. This study focused on the patients with LNUP. Only 86 patients were treated with surgery (plus radiotherapy). Other patients were treated with radiotherapy (84) or chemotherapy (13) or had no treatment (7). For the overall population, failures in the neck occurred in 51% of the patients and distant metastases in 27%, while primary tumors appeared in 16%. Survival rates at 3, 5, and 10 years were 27%, 19%, and 7%, respectively, for the overall population and 45%, 35%, and 19%, respectively, for the surgical group. The diagnosis and therapeutic approach had a direct effect on neck control; failure in the neck occurred in 7 of 47 patients (15%) when fine needle aspiration and radical neck dissection with radiotherapy were performed, in 5 of 12 patients (42%) when fine needle aspiration and modified neck dissection with radiotherapy were used, in 5 of 12 patients (42%) when adenectomy diagnosis and radiotherapy treatment were performed, and in 6 of 11 patients (54%) when diagnosis by incisional biopsy was performed prior to admission, despite subsequent radical neck dissection and radiotherapy treatment. In our opinion, panendoscopy and fine needle aspiration should be the first-line diagnostic approach. When cytologic diagnosis proves impossible, the second-line approach must consist of cervical exploration with frozen section examination and excisional biopsy, followed by immediate appropriate treatment. In cases of LNUP, radical neck dissection seems to be preferable. 
1	Expression of placental alkaline phosphatase in gastric and colorectal cancers. An immunohistochemical study using the prepared monoclonal antibody. The authors developed monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) against human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). Four specific MoAb reacting only with PLAP and two nonspecific MoAb reacting equally with isozymes of alkaline phosphatase (hepatic, intestinal, and placental) were obtained. Immunohistochemical staining with the specific MoAb showed that the cell membrane and cytoplasm of cancer cells were stained in gastric and colorectal carcinoma. The incidence of PLAP positivity was 23% (25 of 107) of all gastric carcinomas. Among gastric carcinomas, the 42% (13 of 31) positivity of highly differentiated carcinoma (papillary adenocarcinoma and well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) was a significantly higher rate than that found in poorly differentiated carcinoma (poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet-ring cell carcinoma, five of 41, 12%). The incidence of PLAP positivity was 11% (four of 35) in colorectal carcinoma. In contrast, gastric adenoma, intestinal metaplasia, and noncancerous tissue adjacent to cancer did not show staining. These results indicated that expression of PLAP was apt to occur in more highly differentiated gastric carcinoma and was highly specific for carcinoma in the gastrointestinal tract, although its incidence was not high. 
3	Anomalous macular vessels: case report and review of the recent Japanese literature. We examined a 19-year-old woman with large macular vessels who had temporarily impaired visual acuity. The anomalous macular vessels had arteriovenous shunts and were associated with abnormal capillary networks. In a review of the recent Japanese literature, we found another eight patients with anomalous macular vessels who had undergone fluorescein angiography. We prefer the term anomalous macular vessels to describe this condition. 
1	Protection of the small intestine against irradiation by means of a removable prosthesis. In radiation therapy of tumors, several techniques are used to prevent injury of the intestinal loops. Their purpose is to drive the intestine out of the external beam. Understanding the disadvantages they present, a temporary prosthesis which effectively protects the small bowel, and is easy to remove, has been developed. The device is a 600 to 1,000 ml, silicone rubber, expandable balloon. When implanted in the pelvis or retroperitoneal cavity, and filled, this balloon displaces the intestinal loops out of the pelvic irradiation field. It may remain either filled or empty between each irradiation session. Due to its particular elliptical shape, once empty, the balloon can be removed through a 3 cm incision under local or peridural anesthesia at the completion of radiotherapy. Eleven patients with recurrent (8) or primary (3) cancer have been implanted. The protective effect has been evaluated on successive biologic tests, performed during treatment. No problem related to the prosthesis, no alteration of the biologic tests, nor bowel injury have been observed after several months follow-up. This device is suitable for preventing intestinal complications during therapy, allowing a higher dose of radiations in some cases. 
4	Femoro-popliteal and femoro-distal bypass: a comparison between in situ and reversed technique. The present report compares the in situ technique with that using the reversed vein for femoropopliteal bypass. In 1986 the in situ technique was introduced at our clinic as the preferred method for femoropopliteal bypass with the lower anastomosis below the knee or femorodistal bypass. Forty patients operated with the in situ technique were compared with an equal number of patients operated with the reversed technique 1983-1985. The two groups were comparable regarding concomitant cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, preoperative ankle-brachial index and level of distal anastomosis. Patency after 6 months was significantly higher (84%) for the in situ grafts compared to reversed veins (49%). The difference was mainly caused by a significantly higher patency for in situ grafts anastomosed to infrapopliteal arteries. Despite better patency rates in the in situ group limb salvage at 6 months was the same in both groups. Operating time was also similar in both groups. It is concluded that the in situ technique is superior to the reversed technique, at least in infrapopliteal reconstructions. The superior patency rate and the technical advantages without apparent disadvantages are the basis for the recommendation to use the in situ technique for femoropopliteal and femorodistal bypass. 
1	Indications for the surgical treatment of osteomas of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. Sixty-one patients with an osteoma of the frontal or ethmoid sinuses have been studied. The following indications for surgical removal of these osteomas are suggested: osteomas extending beyond the boundaries of the frontal sinus, if enlarging, if localized in the region adjacent to the nasofrontal duct, if signs of chronic sinusitis are present, osteomas of the ethmoid sinuses, irrespective of their size and if patients with osteomas complain of headache and other causes of headache have been excluded. The operation of choice is the osteoplastic flap operation. 
3	Automatic rifle injuries: suicide by eight bullets. Report of an unusual case and a literature review. A 25-year-old man committed suicide by shooting himself with eight bullets fired from a military rifle set on automatic. This rifle has two firing modes: an automatic mode and a self-loading, single-shot mode. Using this case as an example, some important aspects of firearm injuries are discussed with special emphasis on those points that are relevant to automatic military rifles and most applicable to forensic pathology practice. Some of the pathologic features of firearm wounds are reviewed and the role of the pathologist is discussed. Lastly, the most important points that help the pathologist to determine the type or nature of a firearm death--that is, whether it is an accident, homicide, or a suicide--are discussed. Classically, the number of the firearm wounds is used to differentiate suicide from homicide. As in the case reported here, however, when an automatic rifle or a military rifle set on automatic is used, the number of wounds is not a reliable indicator of the type of death. 
5	Localization of the human angiogenin gene to chromosome band 14q11, proximal to the T cell receptor alpha/delta locus. The gene encoding angiogenin, a potent inducer of blood vessel formation, has been localized within the human genome. It is present as a single copy per haploid genome and is located on chromosome 14, on the basis of discordancy analysis of human-rodent hybrid cell lines. This localization was refined to 14q11 by in situ hybridization of an angiogenin probe to metaphase chromosomes prepared from both normal human lymphocytes and RPMI 8402 cells. The results from the RPMI 8402 cells also establish that the angiogenin gene resides proximal to a translocation breakpoint within the T cell receptor alpha/delta locus and therefore upstream from that locus. An AvaII RFLP, present at a frequency of 29% in an unselected collection of human placental DNAs, was identified in the coding region of the gene and results from a single silent transversion. 
5	Electrocardiographic and antiarrhythmic effects of intravenous amiodarone: results of a prospective, placebo-controlled study. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of intravenously administered amiodarone was examined in a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study that involved 77 patients after coronary artery bypass surgery. Amiodarone was given after surgery in a loading bolus of 300 mg for 2 hours followed by 1200 mg every 24 hours for 2 days and 900 mg every 24 hours for the next 2 days. Amiodarone suppressed both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias within 12 hours after the start of therapy. Particularly, the incidence of atrial fibrillation (5% vs 21% in the control group; p less than 0.05) and of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (3% vs 16%; p less than 0.05) was reduced by amiodarone. Heart rate was slowed (p less than 0.001) and repolarization--as judged by JTc interval--was prolonged compared with the control group (p less than 0.01). In two patients, amiodarone infusion was stopped because of excessive QTc prolongation. No detrimental hemodynamic effects of the drug were observed. Thus the intravenous administration of amiodarone appears to be suitable for patients in whom rapid suppression of symptomatic supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias is warranted in the presence of left ventricular dysfunction. 
5	Immunity to and frequency of reinfection with respiratory syncytial virus. To better understand the duration of immunity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and the role of serum antibodies to the surface glycoproteins, F and G, in susceptibility to reinfection, 15 adults with previous natural RSV infection were challenged with RSV of the same strain group (A) at 2, 4, 8, 14, 20, and 26 months after natural infection. By 2 months about one-half and by 8 months two-thirds of the subjects became reinfected. Each challenge resulted in infection in at least one-fourth of the subjects. Within 26 months 73% had two or more and 47% had three or more infections. The duration of immunity tended to increase after two closely spaced infections. Higher neutralizing, F and GA antibody levels before challenge correlated significantly with protection against infection. However, even in subjects with the highest antibody levels, the risk of reinfection was 25%. Specific nasal IgA antibody titers did not correlate significantly with protection. This suggests that humoral neutralizing, F, and G antibodies correlate with resistance to reinfection, but protection is far from complete and is of short duration. 
5	Squamous carcinoma metastatic to the sternum. A 63-year-old man had a 10 x 16-cm sternal mass 18 months after a second aortocoronary bypass operation. The resected lesion was a metastatic tumor of squamous histology. No primary tumor was found. The diagnostic work-up and treatment options are presented. 
3	Anisocoria in the pigmentary dispersion syndrome We studied four patients with anisocoria and the pigmentary dispersion syndrome. In all patients, the larger pupil was on the side of the greater iris transillumination. The amount of anisocoria was between 0.5 and 1.5 mm and was the same in both the light and dark. There was no blepharoptosis, and all pupils dilated normally with cocaine. All of the patients were young men with myopia, and one patient had increased intraocular pressure. 
1	Endometrial carcinoma: the relevance of cervical cytology. In patients with endometrial carcinoma, preoperative identification of poor prognostic factors is helpful in planning therapy. Extended surgical staging, including pelvic and periaortic node dissection, is indicated in patients with deep myometrial invasion or high-grade tumor, or when other risk factors for extrauterine spread are present. In this study, cervical cytology was reviewed in 86 patients with endometrial carcinoma, all of whom underwent surgical staging, to correlate the cytologic results with surgical and pathologic findings. Cervical cytology was normal in 20 patients (23%), whereas suspicious or malignant endometrial cells were present in 23 and 43 cases (27 and 50%), respectively. Suspicious or malignant cervical cytology was associated with deeper myometrial invasion (P = .011), higher postoperative tumor grade (P = .006), positive peritoneal washings (P = .012), and more advanced stage by International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics criteria (P = .024). When compared with patients with normal cervical cytology, those who had malignant endometrial cells had over twice the risk of deep myometrial invasion (67 versus 30%), twice the risk of grade 2 or 3 tumor (60 versus 30%), and three times the risk of positive peritoneal washings (33 versus 10%). Seventy-four percent of patients with malignant cervical cytology were stage IC or more. In contrast, 70% of patients with normal cervical cytology were stage IA or IB. Patients with endometrial carcinoma who have malignant endometrial cells detected by cervical cytology are at increased risk of having a deeply invasive, high-grade, advanced-stage tumor, and therefore are more likely to require extended surgical staging. 
3	Uses and complications of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Uvulopalatopharygoplasty has become widely performed for chronic snoring and for cases of obstructive sleep apnoea. Unfortunately this operation is not without morbidity and complications. We report our results of a prospective series of 50 patients undergoing uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with a minimum follow-up of one year. Snoring was abolished in 18 (36 per cent) and substantially reduced in the remainder. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, identified in 11 patients pre-operatively, was reduced in severity in all but three. Troublesome complications were seen in 18 (36 per cent) patients, namely intermittent velopharyngeal incompetence in five (10 per cent), pharyngeal dryness in 11 (22 per cent) and loss of taste in five (10 per cent). One patient had nasopharyngeal stenosis requiring correction. A cautious approach to this operation is required with rigorous case selection. The importance of full assessment and careful follow-up should not be underestimated. 
4	Psychosomatic factors in borderline hypertensive subjects and offspring of hypertensive parents. Psychosomatic factors, sympathoneural and sympathoadrenal as well as cardiovascular mechanisms, were studied in 24 patients 18-24 years of age with borderline hypertension, 50 age-matched normotensive offspring of hypertensive parents, and 49 controls with no family history of hypertension. They were compared by projective and questionnaire-based psychological tests and their circulatory and neurohormonal reactivity to mental (Stroop color-word conflict test and arithmetic test) and physical stressors (orthostasis and bicycle ergometry test) were measured. Borderline hypertensive subjects externalized aggression less (p less than 0.05) but internalized it more (p less than 0.05) and were more submissive (p less than 0.05) when compared with controls. Offspring of hypertensive parents showed a similar but weaker pattern. Both risk groups reported more positive interactions with their parents (genetic risk subjects versus controls, p less than 0.05; borderline hypertensive patients versus controls, p = 0.08) and had higher state-anxiety levels (p less than 0.05). There were more subjective symptoms of beta-adrenergic receptor-mediated functions (e.g., tachycardia, tremor) in borderline hypertensive subjects and offspring of hypertensive parents, elevated heart rates (analysis of repeated measures, p less than 0.001), and enhanced plasma norepinephrine concentrations (p less than 0.05) when compared with controls. These findings in subjects at risk for the development of hypertension suggest that psychosomatic factors and sympathetic overactivity are involved in the early phase of hypertension. 
5	Holter monitoring of ventricular arrhythmias in a randomised, controlled study of intravenous streptokinase in acute myocardial infarction. The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias attributed to streptokinase treatment in acute myocardial infarction is not well defined. Holter monitoring was performed for 24 hours in 81 patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction randomised in a ratio of 2:1 to intravenous streptokinase 1.5 x 10(6) IU (n = 55) or placebo infusion (n = 26) 6.7 hours (mean) after the onset of symptoms. No episodes of ventricular fibrillation were recorded. For the whole 24 hour period and during the first three hours after the start of treatment the incidence and frequency of ventricular arrhythmias were similar in the patients randomised to streptokinase and to placebo. But when the results in patients randomised "early" after the onset of symptoms of suspected acute myocardial infarction were analysed separately the frequency of abnormal complexes, pairs, runs, and repetitive arrhythmias seemed to be higher in patients allocated to streptokinase. This may reflect arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. 
5	Pulmonary resection combined with cardiac operations. Surgical management of patients with concomitant critical cardiac disease and resectable lung lesions is controversial. During a 7-year period (1982 to 1988), 21 patients underwent combined cardiac and pulmonary operations. Patients had cardiac symptoms only; the lung lesions were found on preoperative chest roentgenograms. The pathological diagnosis was established in only 2 of the patients before operation. All underwent concurrent pulmonary resection during cardiac operations requiring extracorporeal circulation. The pulmonary operations included 17 wedge resections and four lobectomies. The final diagnoses in 8 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer included epidermoid carcinoma (4), adenocarcinoma (3), and bronchoalveolar carcinoma (1). Postoperatively, 1 patient required a permanent pacemaker and 1 patient died. The actuarial survival at 5 years for all patients who underwent combined procedures was 95%. The 5-year survival for the 8 patients with lung cancer was 88% compared with 100% for those with benign pulmonary pathology (p = 0.172). This experience suggests that combining pulmonary resection with cardiac operations is safe and offers a favorable prognosis to a select group of patients. 
5	Antivenom therapy in Russell's viper bite. Bleeding and renal failure are the two main manifestations responsible for the high morbidity and mortality in untreated Russell's viper bite victims. This study was an effort to find prognostic factors and a practical therapeutic approach for the care of such patients. Early detection of abnormalities in the clot quality test and/or evidence of systemic bleeding followed by immediate correction of the clotting defects using specific antivenom can reduce morbidity in Russell's viper envenomation. 
2	Changes in the basal dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells from alcoholic patients--a quantitative Golgi study. Although a variety of pathological changes have been described in the brains of chronic alcoholic patients, there have been no studies which have addressed the question of alterations in cortical neuronal dendritic arborisation. Loss of neurons from the superior frontal gyrus and shrinkage of neurons from both the superior frontal gyrus and motor cortex has been documented in chronic alcoholic patients; these areas were chosen for this study. Using a modified rapid Golgi technique the basal dendritic arborisation of layer III pyramidal neurons was compared in 15 male alcoholic patients and 15 age-matched male controls. All parameters measuring basal dendritic arborisation were significantly less in the alcoholic cases for both the superior frontal and motor cortices. Changes in the arbor are in the terminal branches, which is consistent with other models of dendritic plasticity. Such changes may explain both permanent and reversible functional deficits in chronic alcoholic patients. 
1	Unexpected, spontaneous conversion of a family of rats, from low-leukemic to high-leukemic inbred line. From a nucleus of Sprague-Dawley rats received in 1960 from the National Institutes of Health, we have raised, by brother-to-sister mating, a colony of these animals. The incidence of leukemia in 313 females and 316 males was 1.6% and 1.2%, respectively. About 3 years ago, we observed a relatively high incidence of leukemia in offspring of a healthy female, no. 1. Among the offspring of this female, observed through 12 successive generations, there were 17 leukemias among 44 females (38.6%) and 21 leukemias among 40 males (52.5%), developing at ages varying from 6 to 11.6 months. The most frequent form of leukemia observed was acute myeloid, with a high count of myeloblasts, promyelocytes, and myelocytes; lymphatic form was relatively rare but was observed occasionally; pronounced anemia was common. In most instances, on autopsy, the pathological picture was that of an enlarged spleen and liver, with the exception of those few animals that developed lymphatic leukemia, with thymic and mesenteric lymphoid tumors. We have no satisfactory explanation for this sudden, unexpected conversion of a part of our Sprague-Dawley rat colony from low-leukemic to high-leukemic inbred line. As a working hypothesis, the possibility of a spontaneous activation of a hypothetical oncogenic virus should be considered. The high leukemic C58 inbred line of mice originated in a similar, unexplained manner [MacDowell, E.C. & Richter, M.N. (1935) Arch. Pathol. 20, 709-724]. However, leukemia developing in mice was subsequently found to be caused by a transmissible virus, whereas, thus far at least, no evidence of a transmissible virus has been found in leukemia developing spontaneously in rats. 
5	Alcohol-dependent unilateral vestibular impairment persisting after a closed head injury. A 20-year-old man suffered a closed head injury followed by symptoms of right-sided labyrinthine concussion with complete clinical recovery within 3 weeks. Episodic vertigo and ataxic gait occurred after the ingestion of small amounts of alcohol over the next 2 years. Electro-oculography revealed a right-sided peripheral type vestibular lesion, only after taking alcohol. This was interpreted as an alcohol-induced impairment of central compensation following an incomplete recovery from right-sided labyrinthine trauma. 
2	Diagnosis of magnesium-induced diarrhea BACKGROUND. There is no specific method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Therefore, the frequency and clinical importance of diarrhea caused by magnesium are unknown. The purposes of this study were to establish a method for diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea and to apply it to patients with chronic diarrhea. METHODS. We measured fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in 19 normal subjects with formed stools (15 collection periods), with non-magnesium-induced diarrhea (36 collection periods), and with diarrhea induced by magnesium hydroxide alone (11 collection periods) or in combination with phenolphthalein (3 collection periods), and in 359 patients with chronic diarrhea. RESULTS. The upper limits of fecal output of soluble magnesium and fecal magnesium concentration in normal subjects were 14.6 mmol per day and 45.2 mmol per liter, respectively. When normal subjects had diarrhea due to the ingestion of magnesium hydroxide alone or in combination with phenolphthalein, fecal magnesium output was always abnormally high. For each millimole increase in fecal magnesium output, fecal weight increased by approximately 7.3 g. The fecal magnesium concentration was very high when magnesium was the only cause of diarrhea but only moderately elevated when diarrhea was induced by magnesium hydroxide plus phenolphthalein. Biochemical and clinical evidence indicated that excessive ingestion of magnesium was an important cause of chronic diarrhea in 15 of the 359 patients with chronic diarrhea (4.2 percent), if not the only cause. CONCLUSIONS. Quantitative fecal analysis for soluble magnesium is an accurate method of diagnosing magnesium-induced diarrhea. Some patients with chronic diarrhea ingest excessive amounts of magnesium (in antacids or food supplements), and physicians may fail to discover this before embarking on an expensive and invasive diagnostic evaluation. 
2	Cytologic patterns in juice from human pancreatic transplants: correlation with histologic findings in the graft. In 19 patients who had undergone pancreatic transplantation with temporary exteriorization of the pancreatic juice, graft tissue became available for histologic examination. In these patients the cytologic patterns in the pancreatic juice were compared with the histologic findings in the graft specimens. In five samples the diagnosis by cytologic studies was rejection. Acute rejection was confirmed in all the histologic specimens. In eight cytologic samples, graft pancreatitis was suspected because of the increased amounts of neutrophils, degenerating cells, epithelial cells, monocytes, and some macrophages, with or without necrotic tissue fragments. All eight histologic specimens showed findings characteristic of pancreatitis. In three cytologic samples, bacteria or fungi were observed. Histologic examination of these patients showed graft pancreatitis. In four patients the cytologic findings were normal. Graft histologic factors were normal in two instances. In one of these grafts there was graft pancreatitis, and in one graft chronic vascular rejection was seen. Our study shows that two different pathologic events occurring in the pancreatic graft (i.e., acute rejection and pancreatitis) are reflected by characteristic changes in pancreatic juice cytology. 
4	Ultra short-acting intravenous beta-adrenergic blockade as add-on therapy in acute unstable angina. To assess the efficacy and safety of the ultra short-acting beta-blocking agent, esmolol, in acute unstable angina, we administered esmolol to 21 patients who had persistent angina despite conventional medical therapy. Following a baseline Doppler echocardiographic examination, esmolol was titrated to reduce the rate-pressure product by at least 20%. Once the patients had been receiving a maintenance dosage for 30 minutes, Doppler echocardiographic studies were repeated. Mean esmolol dose at target response was 17 +/- 16 mg/min, with the dosage range of 8 to 24 mg/min. Esmolol was effective in alleviating anginal chest pain in 18 of the 21 patients. Seven patients eventually underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and eight had coronary bypass surgery. The remainder were discharged receiving medical therapy including oral beta-blockade. During esmolol therapy, heart rate and blood pressure decreased significantly (86 +/- 14 to 68 +/- 12 beats/min and 125 +/- 16 to 103 +/- 20 mm Hg, both p less than 0.001). Cardiac output decreased from 5.4 +/- 1.3 to 4.5 +/- 1.1 L/min (p less than 0.001) secondary to a decrease in heart rate as stroke volume remained unchanged. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased from 47 +/- 12 to 49 +/- 13 with esmolol therapy, although this change was not statistically significant. Both the one third filling fraction as well as E/A ratio (ratio of early-to-late diastolic filling velocities) increased with esmolol therapy (35 +/- 8% to 38 +/- 8% and 0.73 +/- 0.2 to 0.85 +/- 0.23, both p less than 0.005), indicating improvement in left ventricular diastolic function. 
5	Intravenous and oral corticosteroids for the prevention of relapse after treatment of decompensated COPD. Effect on patients with a history of multiple relapses To determine if a regimen of intravenous and oral corticosteroids reduces the relapse rate after treatment of decompensated COPD in the ED, 30 patients were studied. Forty-five visits in which intravenous and oral corticosteroids were given (T visits) were compared with an equal number of matched visits in which they were withheld (N visits). No differences were noted between T and N visits with respect to clinical findings, laboratory results and other forms of therapy. Treatment with corticosteroids reduced the relapse rate within 24 h of discharge. At 48 h, the cumulative relapse rate for T visits (8.9 percent) was significantly lower than for N visits (33.3 percent; p = 0.005). For patients with a history of multiple relapses, a regimen consisting of intravenous and oral corticosteroids reduces the risk of relapse after ED treatment of decompensated COPD. 
5	Physiology of aging related to outcome in the adult respiratory distress syndrome. Thirty-nine patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were enrolled in a study to identify potential age-related changes in organ system function that may help explain the apparent association between age and poor outcome in these patients. Criteria for enrollment included an arterial PO2-to-inspired O2 concentration ratio less than or equal to 200 in a clinical setting consistent with ARDS. Patients were excluded if they were less than 18 yr old, had clinical manifestations of congestive heart failure, were seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus, or had stage II metastatic lung cancer. Patients were divided into two groups: those less than 60 yr old (mean 42 +/- 3 yr, n = 17) and those greater than or equal to 60 yr old (73 +/- 2 yr, n = 16). A group of six patients was analyzed as a separate subset based on a body temperature less than or equal to 97.5 degrees F at enrollment (hypothermic patients, 73 +/- 4 yr old). Sepsis was present in 67% of the nonhypothermic patients and in all the hypothermic patients. Mortality rates were 12% in the patients less than 60 yr and 69% in the nonhypothermic patients greater than or equal to 60 yr. All the hypothermic patients died. Sequential data obtained over 6 days were compared within and between groups. The following results were obtained. 1) The ratio of arterial PO2 to inspired O2 fraction was greater and the positive end-expiratory pressure used was significantly less in the patients greater than or equal to 60 yr old compared with the younger group. 
5	Benign parotid tumour enucleation--a reliable operation in selected cases. The method of surgical treatment for benign tumours of the parotid gland had not yet been rationalized, but many authors recommend parotidectomy as the most appropriate procedure. A series of 289 operations for parotid swelling is reported; the majority of mixed and Warthin's tumours underwent enucleation without either complications or recurrence. The rationale of parotidectomy versus enucleation is discussed but in fast growing, deeply infiltrating and recurrent tumours, parotidectomy appears to be the best choice. In the other group of more commonly occurring tumours, enucleation represents a reliable time saving option. 
4	Effects of low perfusate Ca2+ concentration on newborn myocardial function after ischemia. A greater dependence on transsarcolemmal Ca2+ flux and immaturity of Ca2+ sequestration capacity may potentiate Ca2(+)-mediated reperfusion injury in the newborn myocardium. The effect of serum ionized Ca2+ concentration on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function after ischemia was studied in 5-7-day-old piglets undergoing a 90-minute period of cold-blood cardioplegic arrest. In the control group, Ca2+ was maintained at 1.2 mM (Group A [n = 6]). The cardioplegic solution and bypass perfusate were modified to achieve a low Ca2+ concentration, 0.25 mM, in Group B (n = 6). Left ventricular pressure-volume loops were acquired by using high-fidelity pressure-sensor-tipped and volume-conductance catheters. Ventricular function was assessed from the slope of end-systolic (Ees) and end-diastolic (k) pressure-volume relations during transient caval occlusion. Both groups showed a significant reduction in Ees after ischemia (p less than 0.05). Intergroup comparison of Ees after ischemia demonstrated a better recovery of the systolic function in the low Ca2+ group, 64 +/- 7% versus 49 +/- 6% in the normal Ca2+ group (p = 0.05). There was a significant increase in chamber stiffness index in group A (k, 0.48 +/- 0.06 to 0.65 +/- 0.05 ml-1, p less than 0.01) versus no significant change in group B. This study shows 1) the feasibility of acquiring continuous pressure-volume data in neonatal hearts by using a conductance catheter system, and 2) better preservation of systolic function and diastolic compliance in normal newborn myocardium by low Ca2+ concentration in the peri-ischemic period. 
4	Fragmented atrial activity in patients with transient atrial fibrillation. Prediction of atrial fibrillation (AF) is very important in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome or in the selection of pacemaker therapeutic modality. In 25 patients with transient AF, the response of the atrial activity width to extrastimuli was examined in comparison with 25 patients without AF to see if the results could be used as an index of subsequent occurrence of AF. Programmed electrical stimulation using eight basic stimuli followed by single or double extrastimuli (P1P2 or P1P2P3) were delivered to the high right atrium, and the atrial activities were examined. The prolongation of the atrial activity caused by extrastimuli was termed fragmentation (Frg), and it was defined as the prolongation of more than 150% of the basic stimuli. Frg zone was defined as the zone of coupling intervals of the extrastimuli (P1P2 or P2P3) that caused Frg, and delta max Frg was defined as the difference between the widest Frg and the atrial wave width during basic stimuli. Fragmentation was reproducibly induced by extrastimuli, and there was an inverse relationship between Frg duration and the coupling interval of the extrastimuli (P1P2 or P2P3). Frg zone and delta max Frg were wider and longer in patients with transient AF in comparison with the control group for both single and double extrastimuli (p less than 0.001). AF inducibility using double extrastimuli was significantly high in patients with AF. 
3	Molecular biology of atherothrombotic brain infarction. Because reduced high density lipoproteins may contribute to atherothrombotic brain infarction, we performed molecular biologic and metabolic studies to characterize high density lipoprotein metabolism with respect to its role in reverse cholesterol transport, to clone the high density lipoprotein receptor, and to determine gene polymorphism for apolipoprotein A-I, the major protein of high density lipoprotein, because altered structure may impair reverse cholesterol transport. For high density lipoprotein metabolism measurements, high density lipoprotein 3 was isolated, purified, and labeled with iodine-125. The radiolabeled high density lipoprotein 3 was reinjected, and daily blood samples were taken for 10 days. Synthesis rates and fractional catabolic rates were determined from the specific activities and daily decrements. Preliminary data indicate that stroke-prone individuals' fractional catabolic rates for high density lipoprotein 3 are twice those of normal individuals. Also, the conversion of high density lipoprotein 3 to high density lipoprotein 2 is reduced in these individuals, suggesting that high density lipoprotein may be abnormally processed in individuals prone to atherothrombic brain infarctions. We surveyed more than 100 patients with carotid stenosis using a 2.2-kb probe for the apolipoprotein A-I gene. A subset of these patients displays polymorphism with restriction enzymes SacI or PstI. These preliminary findings suggest that gene polymorphism for apolipoprotein A-I may provide a molecular clue of atherothrombic brain infarction. 
4	Body surface mapping of high-frequency components in the terminal portion during QRS complex for the prediction of ventricular tachycardia in patients with previous myocardial infarction. To study the clinical significance of terminal QRS high-frequency components for the prediction of ventricular tachycardia, an 87-lead body surface signal-averaged mapping was performed in 21 healthy subjects (control) and in 41 patients with previous myocardial infarction (anterior, 20; inferior, 21). Mapping data were analyzed and averaged (129.7 +/- 26.5 beats) for 160 seconds, and the signal-averaged beat was filtered with a bidirectional bandwidth (80-250 Hz) digital filter. J-point was determined from the 87-lead RMS voltage of nonfiltered QRS. For each lead, we calculated the sum of the absolute value of filtered QRS from 20 msec ahead of the J-point to the J-point (A-20). The body surface distribution of A-20 was expressed as A-20 map. The maxima in A-20 maps were mainly located on the upper sternal region in healthy subjects, on the left anterior chest in patients with previous anterior myocardial infarction, and on the central anterior chest in patients with previous inferior myocardial infarction. In the patients in both the group with anterior myocardial infarction and the group with inferior myocardial infarction, the value of maximum was significantly greater than in the subjects in the control group (0.181 +/- 0.086 and 0.138 +/- 0.048, respectively, vs. 0.075 +/- 0.031 mV.msec; p less than 0.01). In patients with myocardial infarction (n = 41), the value of maximum was significantly greater with ventricular tachycardia (n = 11) than without ventricular tachycardia (n = 30) (0.240 +/- 0.076 vs. 0.130 +/- 0.043 mV.msec; p less than 0.01). 
1	Occurrence of human papillomavirus type 16 DNA in cutaneous squamous and basal cell neoplasms. Sixty-eight cutaneous squamous cell neoplasms (in situ and invasive) and 26 basal cell carcinomas from 89 patients were analyzed for DNA sequences homologous to the human papillomavirus (HPV) types found predominantly in the genital tract. Thirty-six (53%) of the squamous cell neoplasms contained HPV DNA as detected by filter or in situ hybridization analysis. The frequency of detection of HPV DNA was dependent on the site of the lesion. Of 40 genital squamous cell neoplasms (penile, vulvar, and perianal), 27 (68%) had detectable HPV DNA. In 25 of these, the HPV type was 16 or HPV-16-related, which was similar to the results for the squamous cell neoplasms of the finger (HPV DNA in 9 of 11 tumors with HPV-16 in seven). None of 16 squamous cell neoplasms from sites other than the genital tract or the finger had detectable HPV DNA. HPV DNA was detected in one of the 26 basal cell carcinomas (4%). We conclude that, for cutaneous epithelial malignancies, HPV-16 is restricted to squamous cell neoplasms of the genital tract and finger. These data are consistent with venereal transmission of HPV-16 to the periungual region and suggests a role for this virus in the evolution of squamous cell carcinoma at this site. 
3	Structural alterations of nerve during cuff compression. Whether compression nerve injury is due to ischemia, direct mechanical injury, or both remains unsettled. To assess structural changes of nerve during compression, peroneal nerves of rats were compressed at various pressures for different times, and the structural alterations were stopped by simultaneous in situ and perfusion fixation. The structural changes observed during a few minutes of compression cannot be explained by ischemic injury because the pathologic alterations characteristic of ischemia take many hours to develop and in any case are different from the ones found here. The pressure- and time-related structural changes observed in the present study under the cuff were (i) decrease in fascicular area and increase in fiber density due to expression of endoneurial fluid; (ii) compression and expression of axoplasm, sometimes to the point of fiber transection; (iii) lengthening of internodes; and (iv) obscuration of nodes of Ranvier due to cleavage and displacement of myelin and overlapping of nodes by displaced loops of myelin. At the edges of the cuff the changes were (i) increase of fascicular area probably from expressed endoneurial fluid; (ii) widening of nodal gaps, perhaps mainly from translocated axonal fluid; and (iii) disordered structure of axoplasm. We suggest that the process of paranodal demyelination and axonal transection are linked, occur during the act of compression, and are due to shear forces. The initial event is expression of endoneurial fluid, followed by compression and expression of axoplasm and cleavage and displacement of layers of myelin. Conceivably, with prolonged cuff compression ischemic injury might be found to be superimposed on mechanical injury. 
1	Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus after total gastrectomy A 64-yr-old Japanese male who underwent a partial gastrectomy for a duodenal ulcer at the age of 21, a total resection of the remnant stomach for a stomal ulcer at age 25, and in whom Barrett's esophagus was diagnosed at age 47, was found to have a tumor at the distal esophagus and was operated on by thoracic esophagectomy. The tumor was a well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading down to the muscularis propria. The entire esophageal mucosa in the resected specimen was lined by columnar epithelium. This tumor was thought to derive from the Barrett's esophageal epithelium. 
1	Uneventful delivery following series of successive treatments for virilized Cushing syndrome due to adrenocortical carcinoma. A twenty-one-year-old virilized woman with Cushing syndrome due to a huge adrenocortical carcinoma was successively treated with trilostane (3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor), subsequent adrenalectomy, and postoperative cis-platinum. Clinical or biochemical abnormalities peculiar to Cushing syndrome gradually subsided, and three and one-half years after the adrenal surgery, the patient delivered a normal female infant. This study points out some of the clinical and biochemical responses of each treatment. 
5	Effects of nimodipine on cerebral blood flow and neuropsychological outcome after cardiac surgery. Thirty-five patients undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) were allocated randomly in a prospective double-blind study to receive either nimodipine 0.5 micrograms kg-1 min-1 or placebo. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured during and immediately after CPB. Neuropsychological tests were performed 6 months after surgery to determine any relationship between ischaemic damage and CBF and administration of nimodipine. There were no differences in CBF between the nimodipine (n = 18) and placebo groups (n = 17). Significant changes in neuropsychological tests were found in six patients tested 6 months after surgery but there were no conclusive signs of ischaemic damage. The nimodipine-treated group performed better in tests of verbal fluency and visual retention, suggesting that some memory functions were preserved better in this group. 
1	6-[18F]fluoro-L-fucose: a possible tracer for assessing glycoconjugate synthesis in tumors with positron emission tomography. The potential of 6-[18F]fluoro-L-fucose (6-[18F]FFuc) for assessing glycoconjugate synthesis in tumors with positron emission tomography (PET) was investigated. Using the tissue sampling method with five tumor models, different time-radioactivity profiles were found: a nearly constant level in Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL) and different clearance patterns in others. Rapid clearance in normal tissues resulted in preferable uptake ratios for tumor imaging of brain and pancreas. Metabolic studies and the L-fucose loading effects on the tissue uptake proved the tracer to be a biochemically active L-fucose analog. Imaging of the intracranial rat glioma and 3LL in lungs or hepatomas in mice by autoradiography (ARG) and intramuscular VX-2 carcinoma in rabbits by PET was demonstrated. Using double-radionuclide ARG, similar distribution images of 6-[18F]FFuc and 14C-L-fucose but different tumor-to-liver uptake ratios were found. A metastasis model seemed to show a higher uptake of both tracers as compared to a primary tumor model. 
1	Introducing the 'walk-up' flap. Reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgeons often find the need for additional soft tissue even when a myocutaneous flap has been previously placed. This article introduces the principles, technique, and results of 32 "walk-up" muscle flaps derived from existing myocutaneous flaps. The anastomotic vascular ingrowth at the original myocutaneous flap's distal end permits its proximal detachment and axial vessel ligation to rotate the proximal two thirds to a tissue-deficient site. In our experience at the University of Miami, these flaps have been predictable (97% viable transfer rate), have provided vascular soft tissue in deficient areas, and have been skin grafted at their surface to increase oral lining or skin cover, among several other uses. 
1	Recurrent or metastatic disease in select patients with adrenocortical carcinoma. Aggressive resection vs chemotherapy. In a retrospective, nonrandomized comparison of patients with first recurrence of adrenocortical cancer, 18 patients were treated with chemotherapy (primarily mitotane) and 15 patients were treated with surgical resection plus similar chemotherapy. Surgical resection of recurrent adrenocortical cancer was often extensive, with morbidity in 20% of patients and no mortality. Mitotane therapy was ineffective at controlling tumor growth. Median survival from the time of diagnosis for all patients was only 23 months and no patient was cured. Disease-free interval greater than 12 months was associated with prolonged survival, but it only occurred in six patients (18%), with a similar frequency in both treatment groups. Surgical resection of recurrent disease was associated with prolonged survival from the time of first recurrence. The potential benefit of this resection was evident in the 5 patients (33%) who were able to live greater than 5 years from the time of first recurrence with improvement in symptoms and signs of hypercortisolism. Although no patient with recurrent adrenal cancer could be cured, resection of recurrent disease was associated with a slight prolongation of survival and good palliation of Cushing's syndrome. 
1	A randomized, controlled trial of prophylactic ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus pulmonary infection in recipients of allogeneic bone marrow transplants; The City of Hope-Stanford-Syntex CMV Study Group BACKGROUND. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)-associated interstitial pneumonia is a major cause of death after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We conducted a controlled trial of ganciclovir in recipients of bone marrow transplants who had asymptomatic pulmonary CMV infection. We also sought to identify risk factors for the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia. METHODS. After bone marrow transplantation, 104 patients who had no evidence of respiratory disease underwent routine bronchoalveolar lavage on day 35. The 40 patients who had positive cultures for CMV were randomly assigned to either prophylactic ganciclovir or observation alone. Ganciclovir (5 mg per kilogram of body weight intravenously) was given twice daily for two weeks and then five times per week until day 120. RESULTS. Of the 20 culture-positive patients who received prophylactic ganciclovir, 5 (25 percent) died or had CMV pneumonia before day 120, as compared with 14 of the 20 culture-positive control patients (70 percent) who were not treated prophylactically (relative risk, 0.36; P = 0.01). No patient who received the full course of ganciclovir prophylaxis went on to have CMV interstitial pneumonia. Four patients treated with ganciclovir had maximal serum creatinine levels greater than or equal to 221 mumol per liter (2.5 mg per deciliter), as compared with none of the controls (P = 0.029). Of the 55 CMV-negative patients who could be evaluated, 12 (22 percent) had CMV pneumonia--a significantly lower rate than in the untreated CMV-positive control patients (relative risk, 0.33; P = 0.003). The strongest predictors of CMV pneumonia were a lavage-fluid culture that was positive for CMV and a CMV-positive blood culture, both from specimens obtained on day 35. CONCLUSION. In recipients of allogeneic bone marrow, asymptomatic CMV infection of the lung is a major risk factor for subsequent CMV interstitial pneumonia. Prophylactic ganciclovir is effective in preventing the development of CMV interstitial pneumonia in patients with asymptomatic infection. 
1	Multiple myeloma: VMCP/VBAP alternating combination chemotherapy is not superior to melphalan and prednisone even in high-risk patients. The efficacy of alternating vincristine, melphalan (M), cyclophosphamide, prednisone/vincristine, carmustine, doxorubicin, and prednisone (VMCP/VBAP) polychemotherapy was compared with the M and prednisone (MP) regimen as induction treatment in multiple myeloma (MM). Three hundred four MM patients entered this study between March 1983 and July 1986; the analysis was performed in December 1989. The treatment groups did not show significant differences with respect to major prognostic factors. Median overall survival was 33.8 months. In the VMCP/VBAP and MP arms, after 12 induction chemotherapy cycles, 59.0% and 47.3% (P less than .068) of the patients achieved an M component reduction greater than 50%. No significant difference was observed in the two treatment arms in terms of remission duration (21.3 v 19.6 months, P less than .66) and survival (31.6 v 37.0 months, P less than .28). Patients younger than 65 years did not show any advantage from the alternating polychemotherapy. At diagnosis, the plasma cell labeling index (LI) and serum beta-2 microglobulin (beta 2-m) were evaluated in 173 and 183 patients, respectively. A significantly reduced survival was observed for patients with LI greater than or equal to 2% (16.4 months) or beta 2-m greater than or equal to 6 mg/L (20.4 months). Even in these poor-risk subgroups, VMCP/VBAP was not superior to MP. 
4	Subnormal parasympathetic activity after cardiac transplantation. Heart period variability (standard deviation of 120 consecutive RR or PP intervals) was used to assess baseline parasympathetic activity in 18 patients with congestive heart failure before and after orthotopic cardiac transplantation, and was compared to that of 16 age-matched control subjects. Mean heart period variability (+/- standard error of the mean) was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in control subjects (58 +/- 5 ms) than in the patients at any time before or after transplantation. Heart period variability of innervated recipient atria did not change significantly early (1 to 4 weeks) after transplantation (16 +/- 2 to 24 +/- 5 ms; p = 0.11), but increased significantly between weeks 15 and 37 after transplantation (30 +/- 5 ms, p less than 0.002 versus before transplantation). A stepwise regression model (R2 = 0.35; p = 0.01) showed that heart period variability was directly related to time after transplantation and inversely related to systolic arterial pressure after transplantation and degree of rejection. Heart period variability of the denervated donor atria did not change from early to late periods after transplantation, suggesting that vagal reinnervation of the donor heart had not occurred. These data indicate that baseline parasympathetic activity does not increase significantly during the first month after transplantation but increases significantly between months 3 and 6. 
4	Why do lean hypertensives have higher mortality rates than other hypertensives? Findings of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program. Specific causes of death were analyzed for 10,908 participants in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program, to explore possible explanations for the observed excess 8.3-year mortality from all causes in hypertensives with low body mass. Although the cardiovascular mortality rate among men in the lowest decile of body mass (body mass index 21.96 or less) was 50% higher than that of men in the median class (body mass index 26.4-28.8), death rate for noncardiovascular deaths was more than 2 1/2 times higher in men with lean versus median body mass. The pattern was similar among women. Among noncardiovascular causes, striking differences in mortality rates between lean hypertensives and those of average body mass were observed for cirrhotic death (relative risk of 12+ in men and 11+ in women), for nonmalignant respiratory disease in men (relative risk of 7+), for violent death (both sexes), and for malignant neoplasms in men. Prevalence of smoking was almost twice as high in the lowest compared with the median body mass group; among the lean, excess deaths, particularly noncardiovascular deaths, were concentrated among smokers. Thus, male smokers in the lowest decile of body mass constituted only 3% of the study population, but contributed 8% of all deaths, 11% of all noncardiovascular deaths, and 22% of all cirrhotic deaths. A larger proportion of deaths occurred early in follow-up in the lean versus other hypertensives, suggesting occult disease among the lean at baseline. There was no evidence that more severe or treatment-resistant hypertension was present in or could explain excess mortality among the hypertensives with low body mass. The inference from the findings is not that overweight is protective for hypertensives nor that excess risk is due to leanness per se. Rather, a reasonable hypothesis, particularly from findings on specific causes of death, is that excess mortality in lean hypertensives is due to deleterious lifestyles, particularly smoking and excess alcohol intake, contributing to both leanness and risk of death. 
4	Effect of long-term exercise on regional myocardial function and coronary collateral development after gradual coronary artery occlusion in pigs. The effect of myocardial ischemia, induced by long-term exercise, on regional myocardial function and coronary collateral development was examined in pigs after gradual occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) with an ameroid occluder. Thirty days after surgery, regional myocardial function and blood flow were assessed during exercise in 22 pigs separated into exercise (n = 12) and sedentary groups (n = 10). The exercise group trained on a treadmill for 25 +/- 1 days, 30-50 min/day, at heart rates of 210-220 beats/min. After 5 weeks, another exercise test was performed. In the exercise group, after training, we observed an improvement in systolic wall thickening, expressed as a percentage of rest, in the collateral-dependent LCx region from 64 +/- 8% to 87 +/- 6% (p less than 0.01) at moderate exercise levels (220 beats/min) and from 45 +/- 7% to 73 +/- 7% (p less than 0.01) at severe exercise levels (265 beats/min). Transmural myocardial blood flow in the LCx region expressed as a ratio of flow in the nonoccluded region of the left ventricle also increased significantly (p less than 0.01) during severe exercise after 5 weeks. The sedentary group showed an improvement in systolic wall thickening in the LCx region during moderate exercise compared with the initial exercise test (p less than 0.05) but no significant change in systolic wall thickening or myocardial blood flow ratios during severe exercise after 5 weeks. We conclude that long-term exercise after gradual LCx coronary artery occlusion in pigs improves myocardial function and coronary collateral reserve in collateral-dependent myocardium during exercise. 
1	Quality of life research in oncology. Past achievements and future priorities. The status of quality of life research in oncology is assessed, and priorities for future research with regard to conceptual and theoretical developments, focus and content of research, research designs and practical strategies for research implementation, and transferring information to clinical practice and medical policy decision-making are identified. There is general agreement that quality of life is a subjective and multidimensional construct, yet comprehensive theoretical models have not been developed and applied fully. We recommend that future research be based on conceptual models that explicate the interrelationships among quality of life domains throughout the stages of cancer care. These models, and the longitudinal research that follows from them, should attend specifically to cross-class and cross-cultural issues to avoid overgeneralization from theory and research that are based largely on the views of the majority culture. We encourage the inclusion of this theory-based quality of life assessment as a standard component of clinical trials. Success in this endeavor will require additional standardization of quality of life measures for use across a range of cancer patient populations, including the development of age-specific norms and instruments designed to assess the entire family system. 
3	Kearns-Sayre syndrome presenting as renal tubular acidosis. Renal tubular acidosis and tetany were the 1st manifestations of Kearns-Sayre syndrome in a 5-year-old child. Subsequently, he developed progressive external ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, retinopathy, heart block, and endocrinopathy. There was a 7.5-kb deletion of mitochondrial DNA documented in muscle, kidney, skin fibroblasts, and leukocytes, providing evidence for a multisystem mitochondrial cytopathy. 
4	Prognosis of acute myocardial infarction complicated by primary ventricular fibrillation. Principal Investigators of the SPRINT Study. In 5,839 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), hospitalized between July 1981 and July 1983 in 14 coronary care units in Israel, the incidence of primary ventricular fibrillation (VF) was 2.1%. Patients with primary VF resembled counterparts without VF in terms of age, gender, frequency of previous AMI and past cigarette smoking habits. The hospital course of patients with primary VF revealed increased incidence of primary atrial fibrillation and atrioventricular block. Increased serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase and lactic dehydrogenase were noted among the patients with primary VF. In-hospital mortality rate was 18.8% in 122 patients with primary VF compared with 8.5% in 3,707 patients forming the reference group (p less than 0.01). Adjustment by age using logistic function yielded an estimate of 2.86 for relative mortality odds associated with primary VF, and further adjustment by gender, history of AMI, systemic hypertension, and by enzymatically estimated infarct size slightly reduced the estimated odds, at 2.52 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 4.46). Prognosis after discharge from the hospital was independent of primary VF. In conclusion, primary VF exerts an independent, significant effect on in-hospital mortality. 
4	Durability of vein graft revision: the outcome of secondary procedures. Occlusive lesions that reduced graft blood flow and ankle systolic pressure were identified in 83 femorodistal saphenous vein bypasses by use of duplex scanning or arteriography. Sites of stenosis included vein conduit (n = 41), anastomoses (n = 20), outflow arteries (n = 15), or inflow (n = 9) arteries. One hundred three secondary procedures consisting of vein-patch angioplasty (n = 31), sequential (n = 21) or interposition (n = 17) graft placement, percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty (n = 17), or excision of the lesion and primary anastomosis (n = 16) were performed to correct primary (n = 85) or recurrent (n = 18) graft stenoses. Cumulative graft patency after reintervention was 96% at 1 year, and 85% at 5 years. Stenosis or occlusion of revision sites was less after excision (0 of 16) or replacement (1 of 17) of abnormal segments compared to vein-patch angioplasty (8 of 31) or balloon angioplasty (9 of 18). Sequential or jump grafts constructed to improve graft outflow impaired by either myointimal or atherosclerotic occlusive lesions were the least durable secondary procedures. Five of eight graft failures in this series resulted from sequential/jump graft occlusion. All categories of secondary procedures normalized graft and limb hemodynamics, although only one third of patients reported symptoms of limb ischemia before revision. Surveillance of infrainguinal vein bypasses for occlusive lesions is a valid concept to salvage patent but hemodynamically-failing grafts. Secondary procedures that excised the lesion, used autologous tissue reconstruction, and normalized hemodynamics at the revision site and in the vein bypass were associated with a low incidence of restenosis and prolonged graft patency. 
3	Epilepsy. As surgical treatments for adult and pediatric forms of epilepsy have become more refined, methods for noninvasive localization of epileptogenic foci have become increasingly important. Detection of focal brain metabolic or flow abnormalities is now well recognized as an essential step in the presurgical evaluation of many patients with epilepsy. Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is most beneficial when used in the context of the total clinical evaluation of patients, including scalp EEG, invasive EEG, neuropsychologic testing, etc. Metabolic PET studies also give insight into pathophysiologic mechanisms of epilepsy. The dynamic nature of the interictal hypometabolism observed with 18[F]FDG in some patients suggests that excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitters and their receptors may be involved. An exciting current application of PET scanning is the use of tracers for neurotransmitter receptors in the study of epilepsy patients. Mu and non-mu opiate receptors have been extensively studied and are beginning to give new insights into this disorder. Increased labeling of mu receptors in temporal neocortex using 11C-carfentanil has been demonstrated and, in some patients, supplements the clinical localization information from 18[F]FDG studies. Increased mu opiate receptor number or affinity is thought to play a role in anticonvulsant mechanisms. Specificity of increased mu receptors is supported by the absence of significant changes in non-mu opiate receptors. Other brain receptors are also of interest for future studies, particularly those for excitatory neurotransmitters. Combined studies of flow, metabolism, and neuroreceptors may elucidate the factors responsible for initiation and termination of seizures, thus improving patient treatment. 
5	Emergency center ultrasonography in the evaluation of hemoperitoneum: a prospective study. The reliability of ultrasonographic detection (US) of hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma was evaluated in a prospective study of 72 patients. Independent of the examiner, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were, respectively, 86.7%, 100%, and 97.2%. Laparotomy was indicated in 76.9% of US hemoperitoneum-positive cases. No negative laparotomies were performed in this study group. If hemoperitoneum is revealed in US and vital signs are unstable, we think laparotomy is indicated. We believe that US in an emergency center is a quick, safe screening method in the evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma. US might take over a great part of the role of diagnostic peritoneal lavage. 
2	Prospective randomized study on the effect of ranitidine against injection ulcer after endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for esophageal varices. Thirty-five consecutive patients undergoing endoscopic injection sclerotherapy for esophageal varices were randomly allocated to either ranitidine-administered group (18 patients) or ranitidine-nonadministered group (17 patients), in an attempt to evaluate the efficacy of ranitidine for prevention and healing of postinjection ulcer with a prospective randomized trial. Two of seventeen patients in the nonadministered group dropped out of this trial because of development of gastric ulcer, so 18 patients in the first group were evaluated and compared with the 15 remaining patients in the second group. Sclerotherapy was performed with 5% ethanolamine oleate and 0.6% polydocanol; the mean number of injection courses and the mean amount of sclerosant were the same in both groups. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the two groups in either the occurrence rate or the size of injection ulcer 1 wk after the last session. However, the persistence rate of ulcer 1 month after last injection in the ranitidine-administered group was significantly lower than that in the ranitidine-nonadministered group (6.3% vs. 38.5%, p less than 0.05). Our study demonstrated that ranitidine administration will help to hasten healing of postinjection ulcer, although it was not effective for prevention of injection ulcer. 
5	Early gastric cancer. Twenty-eight-year experience. A retrospective study of early gastric cancer (60 patients) was performed to evaluate its diagnosis and treatment. Ninety-five per cent of patients presented with nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms and 53.3% had been treated for presumed benign disease for up to 48 months before diagnosis. Fiberoptic endoscopy detected these lesions more accurately than radiologic examination. The disease-free 5-year survival rate after resection was 76.4%. Survival showed no significant correlation with sex, tumor site, macroscopic appearance, extent of gastric resection, or histopathologic type. Tumors larger than 1.5 cm in diameter, invasion of submucosa, or lymph node metastasis resulted in significantly lower survival rates. Three of eight patients with nodal metastasis survived 5 or more years, including one who had second-echelon deposits. A high index of suspicion may permit more frequent detection. Extended lymphadenectomy (R2) is recommended to achieve the highest possible cure rate. 
1	Meningeal involvement in Bence Jones multiple myeloma. A case of Bence Jones kappa multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement in a 64-year-old woman is presented. Three years after the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, gait disturbances developed followed by visual disorders and impaired consciousness. A lumbar puncture revealed numerous atypical plasma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid. Craniospinal irradiation and intrathecal injections of methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisolone were effective for a short period. At autopsy, the leptomeninges were infiltrated diffusely with atypical plasma cells. A review of the literature showed that multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement is accompanied frequently by circulating atypical plasma cells or plasma cell leukemia. Meningeal involvement is a rare complication and shows poor prognosis in cases of multiple myeloma. 
3	Platelet-activating factor. A putative mediator in central nervous system injury? Platelet-activating factor (1-O-hexadecyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) is a potent lipid autacoid produced by many cell types. Platelet-activating factor is produced by cerebellar granule cells in culture and has been extracted from brain tissue. Multiple platelet-activating factor receptors have been demonstrated in brain tissue. Activation of platelet-activating factor receptors in transformed neuronal cell lines involved increases in intracellular calcium. Platelet-activating factor has potent actions on cerebral vessels and cerebral metabolism when administered in vivo, but may not have direct effects on brain microvessels. Excessive platelet-activating factor production in pathological states of the nervous system such as neurotrauma and stroke has been shown in only a few models (e.g., spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion or focal repercussion brain injury). In multiple studies using highly specific and potent platelet-activating factor antagonists, reversal or prevention of key consequences of brain injury such as hypoperfusion following ischemia, reperfusion and edema, inflammatory cell accumulation, neurologic/motor deficits, and neuronal salvage were demonstrated. This review provides and analyzes evidence in support of the role that platelet-activating factor might have in modulation of brain function and pathophysiological processes in brain ischemia and trauma. 
1	Beta-carotene's effects on serum lipoproteins and immunologic indices in humans. Doses of beta-carotene for cancer-prevention trials have been chosen based on epidemiologic data. Mechanisms of the putative antineoplastic effects by beta-carotene are unknown but may involve modulation of the immune system. We measured plasma carotenoid concentrations and selected immunologic indices at baseline and at 2 and 4 wk in 50 healthy humans (5 groups of 10 each) ingesting 0, 15, 45, 180, or 300 mg beta-carotene/d for 1 mo in this randomized placebo-controlled, open-label, parallel study. Plasma beta-carotene concentrations were markedly increased by 2 wk and were correlated with dose. Beta-carotene concentrations plateaued between 2 and 4 wk except for the 300-mg group. Thus, we developed a dose-concentration curve to optimize beta-carotene-dose selection to achieve target plasma concentrations. We were unable to identify any effects of beta-carotene ingestion on the immunologic indices studied, but modest increases in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol were observed in all beta-carotene-treated groups. 
5	The alien hand sign. Localization, lateralization and recovery. The alien hand sign was first described by Brion and Jedynak as a "feeling of estrangement between the patient and one of his hands." The affected hand frequently shows a grasp reflex and an instinctive grasp reaction as well as elements of what Denny-Brown referred to as a "magnetic apraxia" associated with frontal lobe damage. Most notably, however, the affected hand is observed to perform apparently purposive behaviors that are perceived as being outside the volitional control of the patient. The patients interpret the behavior of their own affected limb as being controlled by an external agent. They do not feel that they are initiating or controlling the behavior of the hand and often express dismay at the hand's "extravolitional" activity. The patients attempt to control behavior of the alien hand with the unimpaired hand by forcibly restraining the affected limb, an act that may be termed "self-restriction." In this paper, we report an additional four cases of alien hand sign in right-handed subjects: two involving the right hand and two involving the left hand. In each case, the clinical findings were associated with extensive unilateral damage of the medial frontal cortex of the hemisphere contralateral to the affected hand. Furthermore, the alien movement gradually disappears over the course of 6-12 months after the stroke. These clinical case studies are presented and discussed in the context of the "dual premotoer systems hypothesis," an anatomicophysiological model that proposes that action is organized by two separate but interactive premotor brain systems corresponding to evolutionarily defined medial and lateral cortical moieties. It is hypothesized that the alien mode behavior results from unconstrained activity of the lateral premotor system in the damaged hemisphere. The residual volitional control in the limb occurs through the activity of the intact medial premotor system of the ipsilateral hemisphere. Recovery may occur through extension of these ipsilateral control mechanisms by compensatory changes in subcortical systems controlling hemispheric activation associated with adaptive behavior. This observation may be important in understanding mechanisms involved in motor recovery after stroke. 
1	Hepatic arterial embolization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. Transarterial hepatic embolization was attempted in 10 and succeeded in nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma accompanied by extensive celiac arterial stenosis. All catheterization was done through the femoral artery. In six cases, the tip of the catheter (2.5-F ball-tip microcatheter in three cases, 4-F ball-tip supple catheter in three cases) was placed in the proper hepatic artery through the pancreaticoduodenal collaterals. In three cases, a ball-tip microcatheter was injected from the guiding catheter, which was placed in a pinhole of the celiac trunk. These techniques involving flow-guided ball-tip catheters are of great value for hepatic arterial catheterization in cases of extensive celiac arterial stenosis. 
4	Venous stasis and vein lumen changes during surgery The mechanisms underlying the development of postoperative deep vein thrombosis remain to be fully elucidated. Previous studies have suggested that peroperative venous distension may be a factor associated with venous thromboembolism. In this study we have obtained high resolution ultrasound images of gastrocnemius and posterior tibial veins in 62 patients undergoing a range of general surgical procedures. From these we determined the changes in vein diameter occurring during the operative procedures, in response to induction of anaesthesia, and after completion of surgery. Veins showed no evidence of dilatation in response to the induction of anaesthesia, but by the end of the operative procedure showed distension of 22-28 per cent. Distension was most prominent in the gastrocnemius veins, and lesser distension was observed in the posterior tibial veins. In a series of patients who received an infusion of 1 litre of saline in addition to basal requirements, distension was 57 per cent compared with 22 per cent in the corresponding control group. Intraoperative venous distension is associated with factors that lead to deep vein thrombosis and may be involved in the mechanisms which result in the commencement of deep vein thrombosis. 
5	Haemostatic changes in the loin pain and haematuria syndrome: secondary to renal vasospasm? Twenty-five patients (seven male, 18 female) were diagnosed as having the loin pain and haematuria syndrome. Presenting symptoms were either loin pain alone or pain associated with macroscopic or microscopic haematuria, and were longstanding, having been present for mean of 9.3 years in males, and 10 years in females. Ten patients described symptoms of passing gravel or renal stones but these were only demonstrated radiologically in two patients. Investigation of all patients showed anatomically normal renal tracts, normal renal function, and no significant proteinuria. Phase-contrast microscopy during episodes of haematuria revealed dysmorphic red cells in all 10 patients studied. Renal biopsies were performed in 20 patients and showed no glomerular pathology, but arteriolar and arterial hyalinosis was seen in 13 of 20 (65 per cent), fibro-elastosis in larger vessels in eight of 20 (40 per cent) and red blood cells in tubules in 13 of 20 (65 per cent) patients. The histological appearance in vessels was similar to that seen in cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity and would be consistent with the hypothesis that regional vasospasm occurs in the cortical circulation. Haematological studies in 22 patients, when compared with age and sex matched controls, showed the presence of circulating platelet aggregates, elevation of plasma beta-thromboglobulin (p less than 0.001), and increased platelet aggregation in response to serotonin and ADP (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.03, respectively). Plasma concentrations of D dimer (p less than 0.02) and C-reactive protein (p less than 0.03) were also significantly elevated in the patient group. There was no deterioration of renal function during a mean observation period of 3.7 years and no patients developed proteinuria. Treatment was largely supportive; seven patients with intractable loin pain underwent surgical denervation with the relief of pain in four. 
3	Outcome among surviving very low birthweight infants: a meta-analysis. Because published outcome studies are the only available source of data about the morbidity among surviving very low birthweight infants (VLBW, less than 1500 g) a search was carried out of 1136 references in the English language. A total of 111 outcome studies were found that reported morbidity data in cohorts of VLBW infants born since 1960. The methods used and results obtained in these studies were systematically assessed. No agreement exists about the definition of study populations, descriptive statistics, or measurement of outcome. Follow up ranged from six months to 14 years. In 85 cohorts the incidence of cerebral palsy was recorded, and in 106 that of disability. Studies that followed up infants for longer time periods reported higher incidences of disability. Studies from the United States reported higher incidences of disability than those from other countries. The median incidence of cerebral palsy among all the cohorts studied was 7.7%, and the median incidence of disability was 25.0%. Despite substantial improvements in the mortality of VLBW infants, poor outcomes among survivors are common. 
4	Emergency aortocoronary bypass after failed angioplasty. One thousand two hundred fourteen percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties were performed over a 38-month period. Sixty patients required immediate emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after angioplasty failure; 7 of these had evidence of acute myocardial infarction before angioplasty and were excluded from the study. Of the 53 patients remaining, 27 (51%) had electrocardiographic and enzyme evidence of postoperative myocardial infarction. Two patients died (4%), and 10 had postoperative complications (19%). No statistical significance was noted comparing age, sex, incidence of prior myocardial infarction or myocardial dysfunction, time for revascularization, or average number of grafts completed in those with single-vessel (n = 21) versus multiple-vessel (n = 32) coronary artery disease. Postoperatively, those with multiple-vessel disease required intraaortic balloon pump support (p = 0.06) and antiarrhythmic medications more frequently than single-vessel patients (p less than 0.01) and had a higher complication rate (p less than 0.05). Although not reaching statistical significance, the data also suggest a higher death and postoperative myocardial infarction rate in patients with multiple-vessel disease. Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty carries a higher morbidity and mortality than elective coronary artery bypass grafting, particularly for patients with multiple-vessel coronary artery disease. 
2	Acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy. A case of unusual cholecystitis that developed on completion of interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy is described. A 62-year-old man was treated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells for disseminated renal cell carcinoma. During the course of the immunotherapy, his serum alkaline phosphatase level increased, as did the peripheral eosinophil count (0.31). Subsequently, clinical and radiologic evidence of acute cholecystitis was noted. The removed gallbladder showed acalculus cholecystitis with extensive diffuse infiltrates of numerous eosinophils and T lymphocytes, but sparse polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The authors name this unusual cholecystitis acalculus lymphoeosinophilic cholecystitis and believe it to be associated with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cell therapy. The pathogenic relationship is discussed. 
5	Eleven years' experience with retinopathy of prematurity: visual results and contribution of cryoablation. We report our 11 years' experience of cryotherapy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). Charts of 624 infants weighing under 1250 g who were admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during 1977-87 were reviewed. Three hundred and eighty nine babies survived, and the total ROP prevalence was 57.5%. Cryotherapy was applied to 35%. Only one case (0.25%) of blindness was detected, and four babies (1%) had a final visual acuity of less than 20/200 in one eye. The complication rate following cryoablation was very low. 
1	Pulmonary tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries. A prospective study of 12 cases. Pulmonary tumor embolism leading to subacute cor pulmonale has been extensively studied. However, to our knowledge, the involvement of pulmonary alveolar capillaries has not previously been studied in detail. A prospective study was conducted on 112 autopsied patients with cancer to determine the presence of microembolism in the alveolar septal capillaries. Fifteen sections of predetermined lung areas were obtained and examined. Tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries was detected in 12 cases (10.7%), with simultaneous involvement of other vascular territories in 11. Seven patients had dyspnea; four, right ventricular failure; four, hypertrophy of the right ventricle; and three, arterial vascular sclerosis. The present data have led us to conclude that pulmonary tumor embolism to alveolar septal capillaries occurs in association with the involvement of arterial or lymphatic vessels and should be analyzed within the context of the study of subacute cor pulmonale. 
3	Comparison of motor response to apomorphine and levodopa in Parkinson's disease. The magnitude and pattern of motor responses to single doses of subcutaneous apomorphine and oral levodopa were compared in 14 patients with Parkinson's disease. Although apomorphine produced much shorter motor responses than levodopa, the quality of response to the two drugs was virtually indistinguishable. These clinical observations support the notion that integrity of striatal post-synaptic dopamine receptors is a key determinant of responsiveness to dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease. 
2	Ultrasonic imaging of the abdomen. Report of the ultrasonography task force. Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association. As new imaging modalities emerge and existing technologies improve, indications for a particular imaging method may change. This article examines current indications for abdominal and prostatic ultrasound examination and, where possible, compares ultrasound with other imaging techniques. This is not an attempt to list all possible ultrasound indications or examinations, but rather an attempt to serve as an aid to informed imaging selection based on current literature and equipment. 
3	Frequency of three Hex A mutant alleles among Jewish and non-Jewish carriers identified in a Tay-Sachs screening program. Mutations in the HEX A gene, encoding the alpha-subunit of beta-hexosaminidase A (Hex A), are the cause of Tay-Sachs disease as well as of juvenile, chronic, and adult GM2 gangliosidoses. We have examined the distribution of three mutations--a 4-nucleotide insertion in exon 11, a G----C transversion at a 5' splice site in intron 12, and a 269Gly----Ser amino acid substitution in exon 7--among individuals enzymatically diagnosed as carriers of Hex A deficiency. Mutation analysis included polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the relevant regions of genomic DNA, followed by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization; another test for heterozygosity of the exon 11 insertion was based on the formation of heteroduplex PCR fragments of low electrophoretic mobility. The percentage distribution of the exon 11, intron 12, exon 7, and unidentified mutant alleles was 73:15:4:8 among 156 Jewish carriers of Hex A deficiency and 16:0:3:81 among 51 non-Jewish carriers. Regardless of the mutation, the ancestral origin of the Jewish carriers was primarily eastern and (somewhat less often) central Europe, whereas for the non-Jewish carriers it was western Europe. Because a twelfth of the Jewish carriers and four-fifths of the non-Jewish carriers of Hex A deficiency had mutant alleles other than the three common ones tested, enzyme-based tests cannot be replaced by DNA-based tests at the present time. However, DNA-based tests for two-carrier couples could identify those at risk for the chronic/adult GM2 gangliosidoses rather than for infantile Tay-Sachs disease. 
1	Ectopic retinoblastoma within the 3rd ventricle: case report. Ectopic intracranial retinoblastomas are rare. These tumors usually occur in the pineal, parasellar, or suprasellar regions several years after the successful treatment of ocular retinoblastomas with no evidence of direct extension or distant metastasis. We report here a case of ectopic retinoblastoma occurring within the third ventricle. The tumor was surgically excised by the transventricular approach. Ectopic retinoblastomas exhibit greater differentiation than one would expect to observe in a metastatic lesion of this tumor. The distinction of ectopic retinoblastomas and metastasis from ocular retinoblastomas is important, since ectopic retinoblastomas, unlike metastasis, can be successfully managed by intensive therapy including radical excision. 
5	Age, sex, and road-use patterns of motor vehicular trauma in Rhode Island: A population-based hospital emergency department study. Population-based hospital emergency department data on motor vehicle traffic trauma in Rhode Island, 1984-85, are analyzed by age, sex, and road-use status. Annualized rates of overall and severe trauma were 1,195 cases (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1,164, 1,225) and 102 cases (95% CI = 94, 111) per 100,000 population, respectively. Overall and severe rates peaked at ages 15-24 years. Male rate excesses were most pronounced for motor-cycle and pedal cycle trauma. 
4	Effects of theophylline, atenolol and their combination on myocardial ischemia in stable angina pectoris. The effects of theophylline (400 mg twice a day), atenolol (50 mg twice a day) and their combination on myocardial ischemia were studied in 9 patients with stable angina pectoris in a randomized, single-blind, triple crossover trial. Placebo was administered to the patients during the run-in and the run-off periods. A treadmill exercise test and 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring were obtained at the end of each treatment period. Compared with placebo, theophylline significantly improved the time to onset of myocardial ischemia (1 mm of ST-segment depression) from 7.8 +/- 3.7 to 9.5 +/- 3.7 minutes (p less than 0.03) and the exercise duration from 9 +/- 3.4 to 10.1 +/- 3.5 minutes (p less than 0.04). During atenolol and during combination treatment, the time to the onset of ischemia and the exercise duration were similar (10.8 +/- 4.2 and 11.2 +/- 3.2 minutes, 11.2 +/- 3.6 and 11.5 +/- 3.2 minutes, respectively) and longer than during theophylline administration (p less than 0.05). Ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring showed that, during theophylline administration, the heart rate was higher than during placebo throughout the 24 hours (p less than 0.05). During atenolol and during combination treatment the heart rate was similar and in both cases lower than during placebo (p less than 0.05). Compared with placebo, theophylline decreased the total ischemic time from 97 +/- 110 to 70 +/- 103 minutes (p less than 0.05). 
4	Renal artery stenosis in patients with aortic dissection: increased prevalence The authors retrospectively analyzed the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in 63 consecutive patients with aortic dissection who underwent thoracic and abdominal aortography. Ten patients (16%) had renal artery stenosis, five with atherosclerosis and five with fibromuscular lesions. Risk factors for aortic dissection were Marfan disease in nine patients, bicuspid aortic valve in one, and hypertension in 54 (including seven patients with Marfan syndrome). If the patients with Marfan syndrome and the patient with the bicuspid aortic valve are excluded, renal artery stenosis was present in 10 of 53 patients (19%) when the cause of dissection was presumably hypertension. This finding suggests that renovascular hypertension is a greater risk factor for aortic dissection than is essential hypertension. The success of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) in controlling renovascular hypertension has been proved. In this series, emergent PTRA successfully controlled the hypertension in one patient with a type B dissection, resulting in an excellent clinical outcome. Angiography should be routinely performed on patients with aortic dissections to evaluate for renal artery stenosis. 
2	Endoscopic and histologic appearance of the gastric mucosa in patients with portal hypertension. To assess reliability of the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the gastric mucosa for diagnosing portal hypertension, 50 patients with portal hypertension and 1323 controls were studied. Endoscopic evidence of mild gastritis was seen more frequently in patients with portal hypertension than in the control group (42% vs. 13.1%, p less than 0.001). The mosaic sign was also seen more frequently in patients with portal hypertension compared with controls (14% vs. 0.9%, p less than 0.001). However, the mosaic sign was found to be nonspecific, and the sensitivity for diagnosis of portal hypertension was only 14%. Biopsy specimens from the stomach of all patients with portal hypertension and 100 controls with a normal endoscopic appearance revealed mucosal vascular congestion in 72% of patients with portal hypertension compared with 59% of controls (NS). There was no correlation between endoscopic and histologic evidence of congestive gastropathy. Similarly, there was no correlation between the severity of mucosal vascular congestion and the degree of inflammatory changes observed in the biopsy specimens; both in the control (r = 0.1) and in patients with portal hypertension (r = 0.14). It is concluded that endoscopic and histologic features of the gastric mucosa in patients with portal hypertension are of low sensitivity and nonspecific and cannot be used to diagnose portal hypertension. 
5	Eight and 12 week courses of cyclophosphamide in nephrotic syndrome Seventy-three children with steroid dependent minimal change nephrotic syndrome were randomly allocated to receive treatment with cyclophosphamide (2 mg/kg/day) for either eight or 12 weeks, in combination with prednisolone. All patients had previously relapsed while the dosage was being reduced or within 14 days of discontinuing prednisolone in the six months before receiving cyclophosphamide treatment (steroid dependent), and had severe steroid toxicity. Thirty two patients were treated with cyclophosphamide for eight weeks, and 41 for 12 weeks. There were no differences between the two groups in age at onset of nephrosis or entry into the study, sex ratio, duration of nephrosis, number of relapses before entry, and follow up period after entry. The relapse free rate of patients treated for eight weeks (25%) was similar to that of those treated for 12 weeks (24%) five years after stopping the treatment, and the mean relapse free interval and the sparing effect of cyclophosphamide (if any) on subsequent treatment with steroids did not differ between the groups. We conclude that cyclophosphamide should be used for no longer than eight weeks at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day in children with steroid dependent minimal change nephrotic syndrome. 
5	Usefulness of d, I sotalol for suppression of chronic ventricular arrhythmias. Sotalol is a unique beta-blocking drug, possessing significant class III antiarrhythmic activity. The efficacy and safety of 2 doses of sotalol (320 and 640 mg/day, divided in 2 doses) were compared to placebo in a 6-week randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of 114 patients with chronic ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) at frequencies of greater than or equal to 30/hour. Sotalol significantly reduced VPCs in patients receiving both low (n = 38) and high (n = 39) doses, compared with patients (n = 37) receiving placebo (by 75 and 88%, respectively, vs 10%; p less than 0.001, sotalol vs placebo; p less than 0.05, high vs low dose). The individual efficacy criterion (greater than or equal to 75% VPC reduction) was achieved in 34% of low-dose and 71% of high-dose sotalol versus 6% of placebo-treated patients (p less than 0.003, sotalol vs placebo; p = 0.007, high vs low dose). Repetitive beats were suppressed 25% by placebo (difference not significant), 80% by low-dose (p less than 0.003) and 78% by high-dose sotalol (p less than 0.005). Sotalol decreased heart rate (by 24 to 25%, p less than 0.001) and increased PR (by 4 to 6%, p less than 0.001) and corrected JT intervals (by 12 to 13%, p less than 0.001), but did not change ejection fraction. Proarrhythmia (nonfatal) occurred in 3 sotalol and in 2 placebo patients. Nine discontinued therapy because of adverse effects (1 low dose and 8 high dose, p less than 0.02). In summary, sotalol is an efficacious antiarrhythmic drug for VPC suppression; in lower doses, it is somewhat less effective but better tolerated. 
3	A double-masked evaluation of lignocaine-prilocaine cream (EMLA) used to alleviate the pain of retrobulbar injection A randomised, placebo controlled, double-masked study was undertaken in 115 patients undergoing cataract surgery to assess the efficacy of the anaesthetic cream EMLA (eutetic mixture of local anaesthetic, lignocaine-prilocaine) in alleviating the pain of retrobulbar injection. Sixty three patients received the EMLA cream and 52 the placebo cream. The pain was assessed objectively by the anaesthetist, who observed the reaction of the patient on needle insertion, and subjectively by the patient. Significantly lower pain scores were recorded in patients treated with EMLA cream (anaesthetist's observation: p less than 0.01, patient's assessment: p less than 0.006). No patients experienced serious side effects in either treatment group. 
4	Changes in physician practice for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. To determine recent changes in physicians' practices for cardiovascular disease risk reduction, a randomly selected sample of practicing primary care physicians in the upper Midwest was interviewed by telephone in 1987 and again in 1989 (response rates, greater than 90%; N = 241). The reported mean cutoff levels for labeling a total serum cholesterol level as abnormal dropped from 5.84 to 5.43 mmol/L (226 to 210 mg/dL) and for initiating medication, from 7.34 to 6.54 mmol/L (284 to 253 mg/dL). The proportion of physicians using diuretics as preferred step 1 antihypertensive agents dropped from 60% to 32%. Preferences became evenly divided among diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta-blockers. Advice about physical exercise changed little, but consensus among practicing physicians was high. Substantial improvements were found in smoking cessation activities. Practicing physicians are proving to be responsive to new scientific evidence and education in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. 
2	Gallbladder motility in cholesterol gallstone disease. Effect of ursodeoxycholic acid administration and gallstone dissolution Gallbladder motility was evaluated by ultrasonography in 75 cholesterol gallstone patients and in 77 matched control subjects. All 75 gallstone patients were candidates for oral bile acid therapy (radiolucent gallstones, less than 2 cm in diameter, in well-opacified gallbladder), and 38 of them were also studied during ursodeoxycholic acid administration. An additional 20 gallstone patients were studied 1 year after confirmed gallstone dissolution with oral bile acids. Gallstone patients showed significantly greater fasting and residual volumes, a decreased percent of gallbladder emptying, but a similar absolute emptying and emptying rate compared with the control subjects. Greater fasting volumes and reduced percents of gallbladder emptying were also found in gallstone-free patients who achieved complete dissolution with oral bile acids. After ursodeoxycholic acid administration, fasting gallbladder volumes were greater, and percents of gallbladder emptying were further decreased than in untreated gallstone patients. In conclusion, greater fasting volumes, and not reduced gallbladder contractility, account for the defective gallbladder function in radiolucent (cholesterol-rich) gallstone patients. This condition is likely to precede, and possibly to promote, gallstone formation because it persists after gallstone dissolution. Ursodeoxycholic acid administration worsens the defect observed in gallstone patients. This finding also suggests, although indirectly, that the expected normalization of cholesterol saturation during oral bile acid administration is not paralleled by an improvement in gallbladder function. 
2	Pneumonia complicating abdominal sepsis. An independent risk factor for mortality. Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) is associated with a significant mortality, 66% in a previous retrospective study of NP complicating intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS). We prospectively compared the outcome of NP complicating IAS with that of recurrent IAS (R-IAS) in the absence of NP. Data were collected prospectively on 300 patients with IAS; 34 patients who presented with pneumonia were excluded from the analysis (44% mortality). One hundred seventy-one patients with no NP and no R-IAS (group 1) had a hospital mortality of 20% (34 patients); 36 without NP in whom R-IAS developed (group 2) had a 17% mortality (six patients); and 47 with NP but no R-IAS (group 3) had a 53% mortality (25 patients). Finally, 12 patients who had both NP and R-IAS suffered a 75% mortality (nine patients). We examined the relationships among the following putative risk factors and mortality: APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score (at initial presentation with IAS), the need for mechanical ventilatory assistance following initial treatment for peritonitis, steroid requirement, generalized peritonitis vs abscess, and the need for surgical as opposed to percutaneous treatment. Using mortality as the dependent variable, group 2 vs 3 as the explanatory variable, and the risk factors as confounders, logistic regression analysis indicated that the group difference was significant after controlling for confounders. We conclude that NP complicating IAS is an independent risk factor associated with a significant mortality compared with R-IAS. These data challenge the notion that death in IAS is usually due to recurrent or persistent intra-abdominal infection. 
4	Effect of antiarrhythmic therapy on mortality in survivors of myocardial infarction with asymptomatic complex ventricular arrhythmias: Basel Antiarrhythmic Study of Infarct Survival (BASIS) In view of the high risk of sudden cardiac death and the prognostic importance of complex ventricular ectopic activity, the effects of prophylactic antiarrhythmic treatment were investigated prospectively in patients with persisting asymptomatic complex arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. End points were total mortality and arrhythmic events (sudden death, sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation). Of 1,220 consecutively screened survivors of myocardial infarction, 312 had Lown class 3 or 4b arrhythmia on 24 h electrocardiographic recordings before hospital discharge and consented to the study. They were randomized to individualized antiarrhythmic treatment (Group 1, n = 100), treatment with low dose amiodarone, 200 mg/day (Group 2, n = 98) or no antiarrhythmic therapy (Group 3 [control group], n = 114). During the 1 year follow-up period, 10 patients in Group 1 died, as did 5 in Group 2 and 15 in Group 3. On the basis of an intention to treat analysis, the probability of survival of patients given amiodarone was significantly greater than that of control patients (p less than 0.05). In addition, arrhythmic events were significantly reduced by amiodarone (p less than 0.01). These effects were less marked and not significant for individually treated patients (Group 1). These findings suggest that low dose amiodarone decreases mortality in the 1st year after myocardial infarction in patients at high risk of sudden death. 
1	Giant sclerosing leiomyoma of bladder presenting as chronic renal failure. The clinical and pathologic features of a case of giant sclerosing leiomyoma of the bladder in a male Polynesian patient are reported. The presenting complication of chronic renal failure due to tumor envelopment of both ureters and consequent bilateral renal obstruction appears to be unique in the literature. 
3	Diagnosis of thymoma in myasthenics using anti-striated muscle antibodies: predictive value and gain in diagnostic certainty. Assay of anti-striated muscle antibodies (StrAb) is used as a diagnostic test for thymoma in individuals with myasthenia gravis. Unfortunately, false positive results are common, and their effect on test accuracy is magnified by the relatively low frequency of thymoma in myasthenics. We estimated the predictive values of positive and negative StrAb assays (PV+ and PV-) and gain in diagnostic certainty using values for sensitivity, specificity, and thymoma frequency previously reported in the literature. Sensitivity for indirect immunofluorescence assays ranged from 0.83 to 0.84 (pooled estimate = 0.84; n = 68). Specificity ranged from 0.73 to 0.88 (pooled estimate = 0.77; n = 898). Frequency of thymoma ranged from 0.07 to 0.17 (pooled estimate = 0.12; n = 4,515). The expected gain in diagnostic certainty from StrAb was minimal in those aged 0 to 20 and those aged 60+. In those aged 20 to 60, a negative test helped to exclude thymoma, and a positive test raised diagnostic suspicion but was not sufficient to establish a diagnosis of thymoma (PV+ = 0.46). 
4	Tricuspid valve dysplasia or displacement in intrauterine life. In 450 cases of structural heart disease diagnosed prenatally, 38 fetuses (8.5%) had either a dysplastic or a displaced tricuspid valve. The tricuspid valve was dysplastic in 22 fetuses, all of which had evidence of tricuspid regurgitation resulting in right atrial dilation and increased cardiothoracic ratio. An associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve occurred in 16 fetuses. The remaining 16 fetuses had Ebstein's malformation, 14 with evidence of tricuspid incompetence at presentation and 10 with an associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve. Of the 38 cases, the pregnancy was interrupted in 17, spontaneous intrauterine fetal death occurred in 8, 11 infants died postnatally and 2 infants are still alive; additional abnormalities were found in 8 cases (chromosomal anomalies in 2, ventricular septal defects in 2, corrected transposition in 2, the Chiari malformation in 2, supraventricular tachycardia in 1 case and coarctation of the aorta in 1). Fetuses with severe abnormalities are selected for fetal echocardiography by the four chamber screening program and a high rate of natural loss both in intrauterine life and immediately after birth was observed in the 21 cases in which pregnancy was continued. This would explain the higher incidence of tricuspid valve disease in our prenatal compared with postnatal series. Although increased cardiothoracic ratio and associated lesions of the right ventricular outflow tract contribute to the poor outcome in the cases detected prenatally, the absence of these features does not always indicate a good prognosis because progression of disease can occur with advancing gestational age. No absolute measurement or single echocardiographic feature emerged as a consistent predictive factor of prognosis. 
5	Premalignant lesions: role of antioxidant vitamins and beta-carotene in risk reduction and prevention of malignant transformation. Epidemiological studies have shown that diets rich in one or more antioxidant nutrients may reduce the risk of cancers of the lung, uterine cervix, mouth, and gastrointestinal tract. Study of premalignant lesions offers a comparatively expedient approach to identifying and evaluating the efficacy of the cancer chemopreventive components of foods. Some recent findings suggest roles for beta-carotene and/or vitamin C in reversing or reducing the risk of cervical dysplasia and oral leukoplakia. There are some indications that vitamin C and beta-carotene may reduce the risk of atrophic gastritis and gastric cancer. Additional epidemiological and molecular biology studies and clinical intervention trials using premalignant lesions as the marker of specific cancer risks should become an important component of future research in the area of cancer chemoprevention. 
4	Early assessment of coronary artery bypass graft patency by high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography. To assess the role of high-dose (up to 0.84 mg/kg during 10 minutes) dipyridamole echocardiographic testing in the evaluation of coronary artery bypass graft patency early after surgery, 18 consecutive patients with angina underwent dipyridamole echocardiography and coronary angiography before and 7 to 10 days after bypass surgery. Coronary angiography showed 2- or 3-vessel disease in 7 and 11 patients, respectively. A total of 53 bypass grafts were performed. Before bypass surgery 14 patients had a positive and 4 a negative test result. No complication occurred during the test performed early after surgery. Of the 14 patients with positive dipyridamole echocardiographic results before surgery, 10 had negative and 4 had positive results after surgery. All 4 patients had negative results before and after surgery. In the 4 patients with positive results after dipyridamole echocardiographic testing before and after bypass surgery, dipyridamole time increased from 5.8 +/- 5 to 9.3 +/- 0.9 minutes (p = 0.3) after the procedure and wall motion score index at peak dipyridamole changed from 1.55 +/- 0.2 to 1.28 +/- 0.3 (p = 0.05). Forty-nine of 53 grafts were patent as seen on angiography. Dipyridamole echocardiographic results were positive in 4 of 5 patients who had at least 1 obstructed graft or native vessel obstructed distal to bypass graft insertion. The remaining patient had diagnostic electrocardiographic changes during dipyridamole infusion without wall motion abnormalities. Dipyridamole echocardiographic results were negative in all 13 patients who had complete revascularization. In the 4 patients with positive test results, the procedure correctly identified the localization of the diseased bypass graft. 
5	Maple syrup urine disease caused by a partial deletion in the inner E2 core domain of the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex due to aberrant splicing. A single base deletion at a 5'-splice donor site of an intron of the E2 gene disrupts the consensus sequence in this region. We have studied the molecular bases of maple syrup urine disease by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and the genome of the affected enzyme. The branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) activity in the patient was 4.2-4.5% of the control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E2 subunit of BCKDH (Mr 52,000) was absent and another protein band with an Mr of 49,000 was present. We amplified the cDNA of the E2 subunit obtained from the patient's cell using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNA, in which a 78-bp deletion was identified. The consanguineous parents and a sister had two species of mRNA; the one corresponding to the normal E2 subunit and the other with a 78-bp deletion, whereas findings in a brother were normal. The molecular size of the translation products as deduced from the abnormal mRNA sequence was compatible with an abnormal protein band (Mr 49,000) detected in the patient's cells by immunoblot analysis. Analysis of genomic DNA of BCKDH-E2 subunit revealed that the 78-bp deletion in the mRNA was caused by an exon skipping due to a single base deletion in the 5'-splice donor site. As a result of the mutation, part of the inner E2 core domain was omitted. The specified region of the inner E2 core domain was highly homologous to the region of the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These observations imply the biological importance of the region in the inner E2 core domain of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the activity. 
5	Facial pain. This article presents differential diagnosis and treatment of facial pain. Facial pain is classified in accordance with the recent work of the Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society. The two major divisions are facial pain associated with disorders of the head and neck, including their parts, and disorders of cranial nerves, including their central connections. Special attention is paid to the controversial topics of temporomandibular joint dysfunction and atypical facial pain. 
1	Pseudopsammomatous meningioma with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen: a true secretory meningioma. Case report. A sphenoid-wing meningioma in a 60-year-old woman was accompanied by elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, which returned to normal after removal of the tumor. Light microscopic examination revealed a secretory meningioma containing numerous pseudopsammoma bodies and a prominent vascular pattern. Immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor cells and pseudopsammoma bodies to be CEA-positive. This case illustrates the possibility that secretory meningioma may be associated with clinically detectable secretion of CEA. The report also documents the rare occurrence of elevated serum CEA in a primary benign intracranial tumor. 
5	Laparoscopic cholecystectomy using intracorporeal lithotripsy. Over a 13-month period (November 1988 to December 1989), we performed our first 104 laparoscopic cholecystectomies using an intracorporeal ultrasonic lithotripsy technique. The procedure in three of these patients was converted to an open operation because of hemorrhage with unexpected findings of cirrhosis in two patients and dense subhepatic adhesions in a third. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully used in three other patients in whom common bile duct stones were identified. We encountered only three postoperative complications out of all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed. One complication was a biliary fistula that closed spontaneously 1 week after surgery. The remaining complications were attributable to abscesses, one subhepatic and one pelvic, which were aspirated and drained laparoscopically. There were no deaths. Advantages of the laparoscopic approach included decreased perioperative pain, shortened hospitalization, absence of scar, and more rapid return to prehospitalization activities. 
5	Bcl-2 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks programmed cell death. The t(14; 18) chromosomal translocation of human follicular B-cell lymphoma juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus. The bcl-2 immunoglobulin fusion gene is markedly deregulated resulting in inappropriately elevated levels of bcl-2 RNA and protein. Transgenic mice bearing a bcl-2 immunoglobulin minigene demonstrate a polyclonal expansion of resting yet responsive IgM-IgD B cells which display prolonged cell survival but no increase in cell cycling. Moreover, deregulated bcl-2 extends the survival of certain haematopoietic cell lines following growth-factor deprivation. By using immunolocalization studies we now demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein of relative molecular mass 25,000 (25k). Overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks the apoptotic death of a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line. Thus, Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and interfering with programmed cell death independent of promoting cell division. 
1	Human tumor fluorouracil trapping: clinical correlations of in vivo 19F nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy pharmacokinetics. We previously reported that fluorouracil (5FU) accumulation and metabolism in human livers and tumors can be studied by in vivo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMRS). We have extended these observations by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of 5FU in the tumors of 11 patients with carcinoma of the breast, colon, endometrium, cervix, and kidney, using 19F-NMRS in a 1.5 Magnetom (Siemens Medical Systems, Cerrito, CA) magnetic resonance imaging unit (MRI). These NMRS measurements detected a long-lived tumor pool of 5FU in six of 11 tumors in our patients including carcinomas in the pelvis, breast, lung, and liver. The half-life (T1/2) of this tumor pool of "trapped" 5FU was 0.33 to 1.3 hours (20 to 78 minutes), much longer than the T1/2 of 5FU in blood (5 to 15 minutes). Neither the anabolites of 5FU (fluorinated nucleosides, nucleotides, 5FU-RNA, or 5FU-thymidylate synthase) nor the catabolites (eg, fluorobetaalanine [FBAL]) were detectable by 19F NMRS. Patient response to chemotherapy appeared to correlate with the extent of trapping of free 5FU in the human tumors: in the seven patients receiving 5FU, or 5FU or FUdR plus leucovorin, four of four patients whose tumors trapped 5FU responded to fluorinated pyrimidine chemotherapy, whereas three patients in whom there was a failure to detect tumor trapping were resistant to 5FU. We conclude that NMRS is clinically feasible, and enables investigators to study 5FU pharmacokinetics and metabolism in tumors in vivo. 19F-NMRS of 5FU allows for in vivo evaluation of 5FU metabolic modulation and might be able to guide therapeutic decisions. 
1	Pediatric osteosarcoma: therapeutic strategies, results, and prognostic factors derived from a 10-year experience. Ninety-eight pediatric patients were treated with three separate protocols (Treatment and investigation of Osteosarcoma [TIOS] I, II, and III) and 47 developed recurrent disease (metastases and/or local recurrence). Actuarial overall disease-free survival (hereafter designated survival) was 43%. Over 90% of the patients were treated initially with preoperative intraarterial cisplatin (CDP). Postoperative chemotherapeutic regimens comprised high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue (MTX-CF), Adriamycin [( ADR] doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH), and cyclophosphamide. Primary definitive treatment comprised amputation or limb salvage (TIOS I and TIOS III). Patients treated with preoperative CDP and surgery (TIOS I and III) had a 62% survival. Patients in TIOS II refused surgical extirpation; they were treated exclusively with chemotherapy and had a 23% survival. Survival in patients treated with amputation was 55% and limb salvage 58%. Prognostic factors considered significant in relation to development of pulmonary metastases comprised tumor burden (P = .04) and the percentage of tumor necrosis induced by preoperative chemotherapy (P = .01). Histopathologic subtype was marginally significant: chondroblastic was more favorable as opposed to osteoblastic (P = .05). These findings are compared with results and prognostic factors published in the literature. 
5	Family psychoeducation, social skills training, and maintenance chemotherapy in the aftercare treatment of schizophrenia. II. Two-year effects of a controlled study on relapse and adjustment. Environmental-Personal Indicators in the Course of Schizophrenia (EPICS) Research Group. We demonstrated earlier that a novel family psychoeducational approach and an individual social skills training approach designed for patients living in high-expressed emotion households each reduced schizophrenic relapse by one-half when compared with medication controls in the 1st year after hospital discharge. The combination of treatments resulted in no relapse. Results have now been obtained after 2 years of continuous treatment. By 24 months, a persistent and significant effect of family intervention on forestalling relapse was observed, but the effect of social skills training was lost late in the 2nd year. There was no additive effect on relapse that accrued to the combination of treatments. Beyond 2 years, however, the effect of family intervention was likely compromised as well. Treatment effects on the adjustment of survivors were circumscribed, due, in part, to study design characteristics. Effects generally favored the social skills-alone condition at 1 year and the family condition or combined family/social skills condition at 2 years. 
1	Increasing annual incidence of primary malignant brain tumors in the elderly Between 1973 and 1985, total age-adjusted cancer incidence in the United States (all races, men and women) rose by 10.7%, with an average annual percentage change of +0.9%. Analysis of reported age-specific incidence of primary malignant brain tumors over the same years demonstrates that incidence rates increased dramatically between 1973/1974 and 1985. In 1985, incidence rates for persons aged 75-79, 80-84, and 85 years of age and over were 187%, 394%, and 501%, respectively, of rates in 1973/1974. Similar increases were found in both men and women, analyzed separately and combined. Average annual percentage changes in primary brain tumor incidence were +7.0%, +20.4%, and +23.4% in these age ranges, respectively. Reported incidence in younger persons varied little over the same period of time. The most common histologic type of primary brain tumor in the elderly was of glial origin, predominantly the glioblastoma multiforme and astrocytoma. These tumors are highly malignant and invariably fatal. Two possible causes may explain the increased incidence in the elderly: the introduction and extensive use of x-ray computed tomography since 1973 and/or a true increase in incidence occurring independently of diagnostic advances. 
3	Comparison of algorithms of testing for use in automated evaluation of sensation. Estimates of vibratory detection threshold may be used to detect, characterize, and follow the course of sensory abnormality in neurologic disease. The approach is especially useful in epidemiologic and controlled clinical trials. We studied which algorithm of testing and finding threshold should be used in automatic systems by comparing among algorithms and stimulus conditions for the index finger of healthy subjects and for the great toe of patients with mild neuropathy. Appearance thresholds obtained by linear ramps increasing at a rate less than 4.15 microns/sec provided accurate and repeatable thresholds compared with thresholds obtained by forced-choice testing. These rates would be acceptable if only sensitive sites were studied, but they were too slow for use in automatic testing of insensitive parts. Appearance thresholds obtained by fast linear rates (4.15 or 16.6 microns/sec) overestimated threshold, especially for sensitive parts. Use of the mean of appearance and disappearance thresholds, with the stimulus increasing exponentially at rates of 0.5 or 1.0 just noticeable difference (JND) units per second, and interspersion of null stimuli, Bekesy with null stimuli, provided accurate, repeatable, and fast estimates of threshold for sensitive parts. Despite the good performance of Bekesy testing, we prefer forced choice for evaluation of the sensation of patients with neuropathy. 
3	The Exeter Dysphagia Assessment Technique. The Exeter Dysphagia Assessment Technique (EDAT) uses noninvasive equipment to record, simultaneously, "feeding respiratory patterns," the time drink entered the mouth, and associated swallow sounds during feeding. The easily portable equipment enabled patients' swallowing ability to be tested, at the bedside if necessary, using a small amount of fruit-flavored drink. The results appear in chart form. EDAT findings from groups of normal subjects aged 2-90 years were compared with those from patients with dysphagia of neurologic origin and normal subjects under experimental feeding conditions. The results revealed maturation of the feeding respiratory pattern in the teenage years and remarkable consistency thereafter. Differences in the recordings between the normal and abnormal subjects were sufficiently marked to allow the findings to be used in the diagnosis of other patients with dysphagia of doubtful neurologic cause. Interpretation of the charts and recorded timings of the oral and pharyngeal stages of swallowing permitted a more accurate identification of sensory nerve, motor nerve, and functional involvement causing dysphagia of neurologic origin and may be used as a guide to the origin of the sensory deficit. 
4	Haemostatic changes during continuous oestradiol-progestogen treatment of postmenopausal women. To identify changes in haemostatic balance during continuous oestradiol-progestogen treatment, 60 postmenopausal women with climacteric complaints, mean age 55.4 years (range 44-68) were randomly allocated to receive one of four hormone replacement regimens for one year. All four formulations were administered daily and continuously, each contained 2 mg of 17 beta-oestradiol in combination with either norethisterone acetate, 1 mg (group A) or 0.5 mg (group B) or megestrol acetate, 5 mg (group C) or 2.5 mg (group D). No significant changes occurred during treatment within or between the groups in platelet count, fibrinogen and 2-antiplasmin. Activated partial thromboplastin time was shortened (P less than 0.05) in group D and a decline in factor VII activity and antigen (P less than 0.001) and in ATIII activity (P less than 0.05) was noted in group A. Protein C tended to decline in all treatment groups but statistically significant changes were noted only in groups A and C. Two women developed crural thrombosis during the observation period. 
2	Idiopathic gastroparesis is associated with a multiplicity of severe dietary deficiencies. Idiopathic gastroparesis (IG), a disorder characterized by abnormally delayed emptying of food from the stomach, is associated with many symptoms that could have an impact on dietary intake. The intake of dietary protein, carbohydrate, fat, fiber, vitamins, and minerals was prospectively evaluated in patients with symptomatic IG and compared with asymptomatic controls. Twenty-four patients and 24 age- and sex-matched controls completed a detailed 7-day diet record while consuming a self-selected diet. Dietary information was entered into a computer and analyzed using the Nutranal program. Results were expressed as daily intake and percent recommended dietary allowance (%RDA) when applicable. Patients consumed a diet containing fewer calories than would have been predicted based on age, height, sex, frame, and weight (85% of calculated energy expenditure vs 100%) for controls. Although patients with IG consumed significantly fewer calories than controls (1112 kcal vs 1431 kcal), the proportion of fat (32% vs 34%), carbohydrate (49% vs 48%), and protein (17% vs 16%) was similar in the two groups. Intake of vitamins B6, vitamin C, folate, niacin, riboflavin, thiamine, calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc were below the %RDA. Intake of vitamin B12, vitamin C, folate, thiamine, niacin, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc were significantly less than controls. Vitamin A intake was above the RDA and not different from that of controls. Prolonged t1/2 of solids correlated with diminished intake of protein, iron, niacin, and potassium. They correlated inversely with serum albumin in patients with idiopathic gastroparesis. Conclusion: Although eating less, patients with IG do not consistently alter the proportion of fat, carbohydrate, and protein in their diets. Because their diet is markedly deficient in a number of essential vitamins and minerals, dietary evaluation and counseling is suggested for all patients with idiopathic gastroparesis. 
3	Dwarf locus mutants lacking three pituitary cell types result from mutations in the POU-domain gene pit-1. Mutations at the mouse dwarf locus (dw) interrupt the normal development of the anterior pituitary gland, resulting in the loss of expression of growth hormone, prolactin and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and hypoplasia of their respective cell types. Disruptions in the gene encoding the POU-domain transcription factor, Pit-1, occur in both characterized alleles of the dwarf locus. The data indicate that Pit-1 is necessary for the specification of the phenotype of three cell types in the anterior pituitary, and directly link a transcription factor to commitment and progression events in mammalian organogenesis. 
1	Metastatic carcinoma of the gallbladder from renal cancer presenting as intraluminal polypoid mass. We report a rare case of secondary involvement of the gallbladder by metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A 71-year-old man was diagnosed as having a polypoid mass within the gallbladder when he underwent right nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma. A preoperative diagnosis of simultaneous carcinoma of the gallbladder was made, and extended cholecystectomy with regional lymphadenectomy was performed five months after the initial operation. Postoperative histological examination of the polypoid mass within the gallbladder and a pancreatic mass excised during the second surgery revealed these resected tumors to be identical to the clear cell type of renal cell carcinoma. We feel that this case presents synchronous involvement of the gallbladder and pancreas by metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney. 
5	Postpneumonectomy syndrome after left lung resection. A female infant with a right-sided aortic arch and ligamentum arteriosum underwent a left pneumonectomy for perinatal interstitial emphysema. Radiographic, bronchoscopic, and surgical evidence of compression of the right bronchial tree by the aorta, ligamentum arteriosum, right pulmonary artery, and thoracic spine subsequently developed. This report documents a rare example of postpneumonectomy syndrome following left lung resection. 
5	Treatment of severe intraventricular hemorrhage by intraventricular infusion of urokinase. Six patients with severe intraventricular hemorrhage were treated with direct intraventricular infusion of urokinase. In each case, hemorrhage extended into all ventricular chambers, and a cast formation and expansion of the third and fourth ventricles were found. Immediately after the therapy was started (within 7 days from onset of symptoms), reduction of intraventricular hematoma volume was observed on computerized tomography. On average, both the third and fourth ventricles became clear on the third day after hemorrhage; there was one exception, a case of ruptured aneurysm. Five of the six patients showed excellent or good outcome, although two developed delayed hydrocephalus. No infection or rebleeding was observed. The outcome in a retrospectively studied group of five patients not treated with urokinase is also reported. The authors conclude that this relatively easy method of treatment will greatly improve the prognosis of severe intraventricular hemorrhage. 
1	Conservative therapy for adnexal torsion. A case report. Adnexal torsion has traditionally been treated with oophorectomy because of the fear that untwisting the ovarian pedicle may result in a thrombotic embolus. Such a patient had bilateral adnexal torsion secondary to dermoid cysts. Since standard therapy, oophorectomy, was performed, the patient was surgically castrated. A review of the literature revealed no reported cases of a thrombotic embolus arising from the untwisting of twisted adnexa and supported conservation of the adnexa rather than routine extirpation, except when necrotic. 
4	Combination therapy for anaplastic giant cell thyroid carcinoma. Since 1981, 20 patients with anaplastic giant cell carcinoma of the thyroid have been prospectively treated according to a combination regimen of chemotherapy and external beam radiation therapy. Two types of chemotherapy were used every 4 weeks, depending on the patient's age. For those younger than 65 years, a combination of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) and cisplatin (90 mg/m2) was given, and for older patients mitoxantrone (14 mg/m2) was used. Radiotherapy was carried out between Day 10 and Day 20 of the first four cycles of chemotherapy. It delivered 17.5 Gy in 7 fractions to the neck and the superior mediastinum. Survival exceeding 20 months was observed in three patients. Complete neck tumor response was observed in five patients, among whom four had undergone previous operations. No response was seen in distant metastases, which were the cause of death in 14 patients. These treatment modalities are effective in some patients, both in terms of survival and of local control, avoiding death from local invasion. Gross tumor resection should be performed whenever possible but should not delay the commencement of this protocol. Toxicity was high and remains the main limiting factor. 
1	Surgical therapy of the eyelids in patients with facial paralysis. Patients with facial paralysis have a degree of lagophthalmos and paralytic ectropion. We present our experience in the surgical management of 25 consecutive patients treated for these problems. Paralytic lagophthalmos was corrected using gold weights inserted into the upper eyelid. The advantages and disadvantages of this surgical technique are reviewed. Medial canthoplasty and lateral canthoplasty were performed to rectify paralytic ectropion. Ancillary procedures included browpexy, upper-lid blepharoplasty, and temporalis sling. The results were excellent in 23 of 25 patients and good in the remaining two. After a minimum of 6 months' follow-up, there were no complications. The authors believe that the above procedures will yield consistently excellent cosmetic and functional results in patients with paralysis of the eyelids. 
4	Drug response at electropharmacologic study in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias: the importance of ventricular refractoriness. The clinical and electrophysiologic predictors of successful antiarrhythmic drug therapy for patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in 59 consecutive patients undergoing serial electropharmacologic trials. Structural heart disease was less frequently present in patients for whom effective therapy was found (p less than 0.05). The presence of coronary artery disease and a history of prior myocardial infarction were significantly more frequently present in patients for whom antiarrhythmic drug therapy could not be found (p less than 0.05). The corrected QT interval and ventricular effective refractory period measured at a pacing cycle length of 400 ms were significantly shorter in responders compared with nonresponders (QT interval 428 +/- 52 versus 460 +/- 59 ms; ventricular effective refractory period 237 +/- 28 versus 254 +/- 24 ms; (p less than 0.05). In addition, the interelectrogram coupling interval of the ventricular extrastimulus initiating ventricular tachycardia was significantly shorter in responders compared with nonresponders (223 +/- 37 versus 251 +/- 33 ms; p = 0.003). Logistic regression analysis identified a short ventricular interelectrogram coupling interval (p less than 0.01) and absence of prior myocardial infarction (p less than 0.05) as the only independent predictors of antiarrhythmic drug suppression of the induction of ventricular tachycardia. Greater drug-induced increments in the ventricular effective and functional refractory periods were observed in responders than in nonresponders as was the shortest ventricular interelectrogram coupling interval. Thus, baseline electrophysiologic measurements identify patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia who are likely to respond to antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Furthermore, these patients demonstrate greater drug-induced electrophysiologic changes. 
1	Adoptive immunotherapy of human pancreatic cancer with lymphokine-activated killer cells and interleukin-2 in a nude mouse model. A pancreatic cancer cell line was grown in orthotopic and heterotopic positions in young Swiss/NIH nude mice, which were tested with adoptive immunotherapy. Mice were injected with 1 x 10(7) human cancer cells in the subcutaneous tissue and duodenal lobe of the pancreas. The mice were randomly divided into four groups: group IA (LAK + IL-2) (N = 25) received 2 X 10(7) human lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells from normal donors by tail vein injection followed by 10,000 units of human recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) given intraperitoneally every 12 hours for 28 days; group IB (IL-2) (N = 27) was given the same dose of IL-2 alone; group IC (RPMI-1640) (N = 18) received a placebo consisting of 1 ml of RPMI-1640 intraperitoneally every 12 hours; and group ID (LAK) (N = 14) received 2 X 10(7) LAK cells but no IL-2. Toxicity was significantly higher in group IB, with a mortality rate of 45.5% (10/22 animals) versus a 0% mortality (0/25) in group IA. None of the group IA or IB animals died of pancreatic cancer during the experiment. The animals that did not receive IL-2 died before 28 days in 14.2% of group IC and in 16.7% of group ID. The area under the growth curve of subcutaneous tumors during the course of treatment and the pancreatic tumor weight at the end of treatment were compared in each group. Subcutaneous tumors had a reduced rate of growth in group IA animals compared to all the other treatments. Pancreatic tumor growth was slowed in group IA. The animals treated with IL-2 alone (group IB) showed some slowing of tumor growth that was intermediate between group IA, group IC, and group ID. A similar experiment was done with irradiated (375 rad) mice. Nine nude mice with tumors were treated with LAK + IL-2 (group IIA), eight received IL-2 alone (group IIB), and seven received placebo (group IIC). The antitumor effect of IL-2 alone was not present in the irradiated mice. A highly significant difference persisted between group IIA and all other groups. There was no difference in the histologic characteristics of tumors in control mice and in mice with inhibited tumor growth treated with IL-2 or IL-2 and human LAK cells. These results show that adoptive immunotherapy with human LAK cells and human recombinant IL-2 is effective against human pancreatic cancer growing in nude mice. This effect is independent from antitumor activity from IL-2 administrations alone. 
2	Long-term outcome of massive small bowel resection. The long-term outcome for seven patients 4-17 yr (mean 7.1 yr) after massive small bowel resection, leaving 5-160 cm (mean 86.4) of small bowel, was reviewed. Their mean age at the final enterectomy was 40 yr. Adaptation to foodstuffs and the effects of physiologic alterations and complicating diseases on their return to work were emphasized. More than 3.5 yr after surgery, the patients had adapted to many kinds of foodstuffs, but dietary fat could not be tolerated by three patients. Six patients returned to work an average of 2.7 yr after surgery, but four were obliged to discontinue their work because of rehospitalization for long-term complications. In addition, their working hours were limited, and they could not engage in heavy physical work, owing to physiologic alterations, such as a reduced metabolic state, after massive enterectomy. 
3	A study of cyproheptadine in the treatment of metastatic carcinoid tumor and the malignant carcinoid syndrome. Sixteen patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumors and the malignant carcinoid syndrome were treated with cyproheptadine (Periactin, Merck, Sharp & Dohme, West Point, PA) at maximum tolerable doses that ranged from 12 to 48 mg daily. Usual side effects were mild sedation and dry mouth, but three patients found it impossible to sustain treatment due to nausea and vomiting. Most patients had significant relief of diarrhea, frequently associated with weight gain. Relief of flushing was uncommon. The therapeutic benefit produced by cyproheptadine would appear to be a peripheral effect because 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) excretion in these patients was not reduced. Although there have been case reports of objective tumor regression with cyproheptadine therapy, this was not observed in any of these 16 patients. Cyproheptadine would appear to be a useful therapeutic tool for the management of diarrhea associated with the malignant carcinoid syndrome. An appropriate initial total daily dose is 0.4 mg/kg divided in three fractions with prompt modification to produce minimal and tolerable side effects. 
1	Immunocytochemical characterization of lung tumors in fine-needle aspiration. The use of cytokeratin monoclonal antibodies for the differential diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. In the current study, immunocytochemical typing of intermediate filaments was used for a differential diagnosis of human lung tumors from transthoracic fine-needle aspiration biopsies (TFNAB). The authors have compared the cytologic diagnosis of 53 lung cancer cases with the immunofluorescence patterns obtained using a panel of monoclonal antibodies, five of which (KG 8.13, KM 4.62, Ks B.17, KS 8.12, KK 8.60) react with specific cytokeratin polypeptides and one with vimentin (VIM 13.2). Only in six of 23 samples cytologically diagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma did the immunocytochemical typing of cytokeratins (ICTC) confirm the cytologic diagnosis. In seven cases some of the tumor cells stained positively with antibody Ks B.17 specific for simple epithelial keratin (No: 18), suggesting the presence of some cells of glandular origin. In ten additional cases the ICTC was in conflict with the cytologic diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (i.e., antibodies Ks 8.12 and KK 8.60 were negative, and antibody Ks B.17, positive) supporting a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. In 14 of 18 cases cytologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, the ICTC confirmed the diagnosis whereas in four cases additional presence of some squamous cells was noticed. The ICTC labeling of cases cytologically diagnosed as undifferentiated and large cell carcinomas was similar to that of the group of adenocarcinomas. Thus, the application of cytokeratin typing for TFNAB samples seems to provide a vital complementation to routine cytologic study, especially for cases cytologically diagnosed as squamous carcinoma. 
1	Cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma from nonneoplastic liver. The authors reviewed a series of fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) specimens of the liver to identify useful cytologic criteria to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from nonneoplastic liver. Ten cytologic features were examined in this study: high cellularity, acinar pattern, trabecular pattern, hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, irregularly granular chromatin, uniformly prominent nucleoli, multiple nucleoli, increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio, and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei. These features were examined in a series of 82 FNAB specimens from 52 patients with HCC and 30 patients with nonneoplastic lesions. With the use of a step-wise logistic regression analysis, three features were identified as predictive of HCC: increased nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio (P = 0.001), trabecular pattern (P = 0.002), and atypical naked hepatocytic nuclei (P = 0.03). When these three criteria were used, the sensitivity of diagnosing HCC by FNAB was 100%, and the specificity was 87%. 
5	Preexposure of the peritoneum to live bacteria increases later mixed intraabdominal abscess formation and delays mortality. Intraabdominal infections are a major source of morbidity and mortality for the trauma and postoperative patient. Transient peritoneal contamination with bacteria after either intentional or unintentional violation of the gut are common. The effect of this intermittent antigen exposure upon later formation of intraabdominal abscesses is unclear. Previous experiments by others have demonstrated that repeated exposure to Bacteroides fragilis capsular polysaccharide can induce a T lymphocyte-mediated immunity to subsequent induction of pure B. fragilis abscess formation. In a murine mixed intraabdominal abscess model, preexposure to live Escherichia coli, B. fragilis, or both increased the number of later abscesses and in some cases their bacterial composition. Further, immunization with E. coli alone increased late mortality without altering overall mortality. These data suggest that the alterations of immune function produced by live, transient bacteria upon subsequent mixed intraabdominal abscess induction result in fundamentally different consequences from those observed after specific polysaccharide antigen exposure and subsequent monomicrobial abscess induction. 
3	The development of infratentorial atrophy in patients with idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset: a CT study. The development of infratentorial atrophy in six patients suffering from idiopathic cerebellar ataxia of late onset was studied by a retrospective evaluation of consecutive computed tomography (CT) scans. Four patients had evidence of olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA) both on clinical testing and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In these four patients, atrophy of the cerebellum and brain stem became visible at the same time and progressed in a roughly parallel manner, whereas in the remaining two the brain stem was left intact. In all patients with OPCA, definite brain-stem atrophy was visible earlier than the appearance of non-cerebellar clinical symptoms. The present data suggest that CT investigations at regular intervals may be of prognostic value in cerebellar ataxias. 
1	Hemoperitoneum as a result of coital injury without associated vaginal injury. Hemoperitoneum as a result of coital injury without associated vaginal injury is an extremely rare entity, and evidence by only five cases that have been reported in the medical literature to date. We report five additional cases encountered in two medical centers. Two of these were ruptured corpus luteum cysts, one was a laceration of the round ligament, another was a laceration of an ovary, and the fifth was rupture of a serous cystadenoma. This diagnosis should be considered in patients with hemoperitoneum after coitus. 
3	Snow skiing for the physically disabled. The sport of snow skiing by the physically disabled, which originated in Europe in 1935 and first received attention in the United States in the 1940s, is reviewed in terms of opportunities available, instructions, adaptive equipment necessary, and benefits provided. Persons with a wide variety of disabilities (such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, hemiplegia, amputation, blindness, spina bifida, and muscular dystrophy) can participate. Accordingly, a wide range of adaptive equipment is available--including outrigger skis, flip-skis, canting wedges, ski bras, "toe spreaders," sit-skis, and mono-skis--to allow safe enjoyment of the sport. Programs for instruction of the disabled skier are increasing in number and popularity, and numerous opportunities are available to enter competitive events sponsored by National Handicapped Sports. Both the participants and the instructors relate the numerous physical and psychologic benefits that can be derived from skiing; the sport provides an almost universal enjoyment of the sense of freedom and independence. Snow skiing is an enjoyable, beneficial, outdoor cold-weather activity that the disabled population can safely learn with proper instruction. 
4	Epidemiologic features of asymptomatic cerebral infarction in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. We performed unenhanced computed tomographic scans on 141 asymptomatic patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Thirty-six patients (26%) had hypodense areas consistent with cerebral infarction. The majority of these were small deep infarcts, seen in 29 patients (21%), but 13 patients (9%) had cortical or large deep infarctions. Twelve patients had more than one infarct on computed tomographic scan. Increasing age and increased left atrial diameter were the only clinical features associated with asymptomatic infarction. Patients older than 65 years with a left atrial diameter greater than 5.0 cm (n = 23) had a 52% prevalence of asymptomatic infarction. Patients younger than 65 years with a left atrial diameter less than 5.0 cm (n = 38) had an 11% prevalence of silent infarction. Patients with only one of these risk factors (n = 72) had a 24% prevalence of silent infarction. Infarction was more common in those with chronic (34%) as opposed to intermittent (22%) nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, but this difference was not significant. Hypertension, diabetes, duration of atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, history of myocardial infarction, and echocardiographic evidence of left ventricular dysfunction were not associated with asymptomatic infarction. A history of hypertension was present in only 35% of our patients with small-deep asymptomatic infarction, similar to the percentage in patients without stroke. Asymptomatic cerebral infarction is common in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. The association with enlarged left atria and the lack of correlation with major cerebrovascular risk factors suggests a cardioembolic mechanism. Further study is needed to determine the functional and prognostic significance of these strokes. 
5	Acute epididymitis: why patient and consort must be investigated. In this prospective study of 49 patients under 35 years of age with clinically diagnosed epididymitis, detailed microbiological investigation identified an infective cause in 67%. Chlamydia trachomatis was the commonest agent, present in 25 patients, but in 12 of these detection was based solely on raised antibody titres; 20 of the 28 female consorts screened were partners of men with chlamydial epididymitis and 80% of them were also positive for this infection. Isolating the micro-organism from 14 of 16 consorts indicated active infection despite the negative swabs from the men. If this important infection is to be adequately treated we recommend that all patients in this age group with epididymitis and their partners should be referred to a specialist unit with access to full chlamydia laboratory facilities. 
5	Urovirulence determinants in Escherichia coli isolates causing first-episode and recurrent cystitis in women. To assess the prevalence of urovirulence determinants among Escherichia coli isolates from women with acute uncomplicated cystitis, 121 isolates from 87 women with first-episode or recurrent cystitis and 156 fecal isolates from 52 women without recent urinary tract infection were tested using DNA probes for P fimbriae, hemolysin, aerobactin, and diffuse adhesin and for expression of hemolysin and P and F adhesins. P fimbrial genotype (P = .002), hemolysin phenotype (P = .007), and the diffuse adhesin determinant (P = .03), but not aerobactin, were found more frequently in E. coli from women with acute cystitis, and expression of the F adhesin (41%) was more common than the P adhesin (24%; P = .001). E. coli isolates that caused cystitis in women using diaphragms had fewer virulence determinants than those from nonusers (P = .04), suggesting that diaphragm use may allow infection with less virulent E. coli. 
1	Endosonography in the localization of parathyroid tumors: a preliminary study. A preoperative transesophageal exploration of the parathyroids by endosonography was performed on 23 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The system used was a 7.5 MHz transducer mounted on the tip of an endoscope with an external diameter of 13 mm. The field of visualization was 360 degrees. A retrograde exploration was done moving up from the aortic arch to the upper esophageal sphincter. All patients underwent surgery afterward, and adenomas were found. In 12 cases the adenoma was visualized. All 12 adenomas were posteriorly located on the right side (four cases) and left side (eight cases) of the esophagus. Nine of these 12 tumors were on the posterior face of the thyroid lobes, with six tumors in the middle one third of the thyroid lobe and three in the lower one third of the thyroid lobe. The other three tumors were located below the lower pole of the thyroid lobes in the upper posterior mediastinum. Mean tumor weight was 1165 mg. Of the 11 tumors that could not be visualized, eight tumors were anteriorly located; three of these tumors were on the anterior and lateral surface of the lower pole of the thyroid, and five were in the thyrothymic tracts. The remaining three tumors were located on the back of the thyroid lobes; two of these tumors were at the upper esophageal sphincter, and one was on the side of the pharynx. Mean tumor size was 1334 mg. Localization of parathyroid tumors by endosonography appears possible but only if lesions are located posteriorly, close to the esophagus. Endosonography is not indicated before routine cervical exploration for primary or secondary hyperparathyroidism. As in other such studies, endosonography could be useful in cases of persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism. 
4	Reversible cardiogenic shock due to chest tube compression of the right ventricle. A 62-year-old woman developed shock immediately after the insertion of a right-sided chest tube. A chest roentgenogram showed the chest tube to be overlying the heart and possibly compressing the right ventricle. An animal model was developed to replicate this clinical situation. Using a domestic goat model pulmonary artery, peripheral arterial catheters were inserted along with a right sided chest tube placed to suction. A second chest tube guided by a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope placed within its lumen was positioned between the right ventricle and the sternum of the animals. Thirteen paired measurements in three goats (average of 4.3 measurements per animal) of cardiac output, heart rate, and mean arterial blood pressure were made at baseline and after chest tube placement over the right ventricle. The data were analyzed using a paired t test statistic. Compared with baseline measurements, there was a significant decrease in cardiac output (p less than 0.001) and mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.001) as well as an increase in heart rate (p = 0.0056) after placement of the chest tube across the right ventricle. We conclude that a misplaced chest tube compressing the right ventricle can impede cardiac output and lead to a low cardiac output state. Physicians inserting chest tubes in patients should be aware of this potential complication as it is easily treated by withdrawal of the chest tube. 
1	Magnetic resonance in pediatric and adolescent neuroimaging. With improved availability and a practical understanding of the principles of utilization, MRI will continue to replace CT and US in pediatric neuroimaging, just as it has impacted upon the more invasive modalities. In general, US remains the procedure of choice for screening of fetal and infant CNS abnormalities, and CT continues as the principal screening modality beyond infancy and especially for acute, emergent presentations. MRI has now emerged as a primary option for screening as well as for more definitive assessment of many intracranial and most intraspinal conditions. 
5	Evidence for intraluminal Ca++ regulatory site defect in sarcoplasmic reticulum from malignant hyperthermia pig muscle. Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disease of humans and various animal species that predisposes to a life-threatening, anesthetic agent-induced syndrome. MH is thought to be a consequence of abnormal, sustained increases in myoplasmic Ca++ and sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membranes from MH muscle have been shown to have a Ca++ release channel defect. In the present study we have tested a hypothesis that the abnormal Ca++ release mechanism in MH can be expressed when Ca++ is loaded in the presence of pyrophosphate. SR membrane vesicles isolated from normal and MH pig muscle were loaded with Ca++ in the presence and absence of pyrophosphate until Ca(++)-induced Ca++ release occurred. Under both circumstances the threshold amount of Ca++ loaded until Ca++ release occurred was lower in the SR from MH pig skeletal muscle. This difference in amount of Ca++ preload is not explained by results obtained comparing rates of Ca++ uptake, number of ryanodine binding sites or the amounts of calsequestrin among SR vesicles from MH and normal muscle. We conclude from this study that use of pyrophosphate for Ca++ loading does not ablate the abnormal Ca++ release in SR from MH muscle, suggesting the study can be done on small amounts of SR from biopsied human muscle. The data also suggest that abnormality in an intraluminal, low affinity Ca++ binding site regulating Ca++ release occurs in the SR membrane of MH pig muscle. 
1	Unknown primary squamous cell carcinoma metastatic to the neck. We analyzed retrospectively 157 cases of metastatic neck squamous cell carcinoma from unknown primary sites, treated with surgery, radiotherapy, excisional biopsy, and combined modalities. Median follow-up was 74 months, and overall actuarial survival was 55% at 5 years. The surgery-treated group, despite a higher rate of manifesting primary tumors, had significantly better survival at 5 years compared with those receiving radiation therapy, of whom 23% had residual disease after treatment. Primary tumors were discovered during follow-up in 16% overall. Different treatments yielded comparable results in lower-staged neck disease (NX, N1, N2a), while surgery appeared more effective in controlling advanced disease (N2b, N3a). Factors that affected survival include neck stage, connective tissue invasion, and presence of recurrent or residual disease after treatment. 
2	Safety of same-day sequential extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and dissolution of gallstones by methyl tert-butyl ether in dogs. Passage of stone fragments after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of gallstones has resulted in biliary colic, duct obstruction, and pancreatitis in some patients. Rapid dissolution of these fragments with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) may prevent such side effects and achieve complete clearance of gallstones within hours rather than several months to a year or longer. This study examines the safety of same-day ESWL fragmentation and MTBE dissolution of surgically implanted human gallstones in 15 dogs. The animals were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups to assess MTBE absorption from the gallbladder and to observe hematology and chemistry profiles after 0, 400, and 1,200 shock waves from a lithotriptor followed by MTBE dissolution therapy. They were sacrificed either immediately after treatment (12 dogs) or 2 weeks later (3 dogs). The results demonstrated that although ESWL causes moderate trauma to the gallbladder, this did not result in increased MTBE absorption or histologic evidence of mucosal disruption. Blood profiles demonstrated an increase in only the level of aspartate aminotransferase. The three dogs that were sacrificed 2 weeks after the combined treatment had no residual evidence of gallbladder injury or remaining stone material. In all animals, severe injury occurred where shock waves passed through lung or air-filled colon. This study suggests that same-day sequential fragmentation of gallstones by ESWL followed by dissolution of stone fragments with use of MTBE may be associated with only mild to moderate and reversible gallbladder trauma and can rapidly achieve clearance of gallstones. 
5	Prognostic factors in gestational trophoblastic tumors: a proposed new scoring system based on multivariate analysis. All 1391 patients treated for gestational trophoblastic tumors (invasive mole and choriocarcinoma) at the John I. Brewer Trophoblastic Disease Center of Northwestern University between 1969 (when use of combination chemotherapy for initial treatment of high-risk disease came into general use) and 1988 were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the relative importance of prognostic factors with respect to survival. The overall cure rate was 93% (363/391): 100% for 223 patients with nonmetastatic disease and 83% for 168 patients with metastatic disease. The only patients who died had a clinicopathologic diagnosis of metastatic choriocarcinoma. In addition to presence of metastasis (83% vs 100%, p less than 0.0001) and diagnosis of choriocarcinoma (67% vs 100%, p less than 0.0001), number of metastases (47% if greater than 8 vs 92% if less than or equal to 8, p less than 0.0001), metastases to sites other than the lung or vagina (52% vs 91%, p = 0.0002), and previous failed chemotherapy (46% vs 84%, p = 0.0014) demonstrated independent significant effects on survival in patients with metastatic disease. A Brewer score, based on our multivariate analysis of survival in patients with metastatic disease, provided predictability of outcome (likelihood ratio chi 2 statistic, chi 2 = 49.8) comparable to that with the World Health Organization score (chi 2 = 45.3), both of which, in turn, were better predictors than either the traditional Hammond clinical classification system (chi 2 = 34.4) or the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage (chi 2 = 22.9). 
1	Contamination of peripheral blood stem cell harvests by circulating neuroblastoma cells. Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are being used as one alternative to autologous marrow rescue for patients with neuroblastoma and other solid malignancies. Some physicians prefer use of PBSC because less risk of tumor contamination is believed to exist. This hypothesis was evaluated by immunocytologic analysis of blood samples and concurrently drawn bone marrow (BM) samples and of PBSC harvests obtained from 31 patients with disseminated neuroblastoma. We found circulating neoplastic cells in 75% of specimens analyzed at diagnosis, in 36% during therapy, and in 14% of PBSC harvests. Tumor cells in blood obtained during therapy did not appear until 3 months after the time of diagnosis. Clearance of circulating neuroblastoma cells was documented after two courses of induction chemotherapy. Six of 13 patients with minimal or no BM disease had positive blood specimens. We conclude that substantial risk of tumor contamination of PB harvests exists and recommend that induction chemotherapy be administered before hematopoietic progenitor cells are collected from blood. 
1	Complete spontaneous regression of multiple basal cell carcinomas in the basal cell nevus syndrome: the possible role of transepithelial elimination. A 36-year-old Latin American man with the basal cell nevus syndrome had multiple, soft, hairless, depressed scars of the face, scalp, neck, and back, ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.5 cm to 3.5 x 3.9 cm. These areas had never been treated and previously were sites of basal cell carcinomas that underwent complete spontaneous regression 4-5 years from the date of onset. Pathology of these spontaneously regressed sites was consistent with the criteria established by Curson and Weedon (1979). Type III transepithelial elimination was demonstrated for a basal cell carcinoma. Type III transepithelial elimination may play a role in the spontaneous regression of basal cell carcinomas. 
5	Effect of Towne live virus vaccine on cytomegalovirus disease after renal transplant. A controlled trial OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy of vaccination with the Towne live attenuated cytomegalovirus vaccine. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in candidates for renal transplantation. The cytomegalovirus serologic status of both recipients and donors were determined, and the recipients were followed for periods of 6 months to 7 years after transplant. SETTING: A university transplant center. PATIENTS: The analyses were made on 237 patients who were given either vaccine or placebo, received renal transplants, and were followed for at least 6 months. INTERVENTION: Subcutaneous inoculation with Towne live attenuated virus or with placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The presence of cytomegalovirus infection was defined by virus isolation and antibody tests. If infection occurred, a prearranged scoring system for cytomegalovirus disease was used to objectify disease severity. RESULTS: The vaccine was well tolerated, and there were no discernible long-term adverse effects. Recipients who were originally seropositive did not clearly benefit from vaccination. Protective efficacy was analyzed in the group at highest risk for cytomegalovirus disease; recipients who were seronegative at the time of vaccination and who received a kidney from a seropositive donor. Compared with placebo recipients, vaccinated patients in this group had significantly less severe cytomegalovirus disease, with a significant reduction in disease scores (P = 0.03) and 85% decrease in the most severe disease (95% CI, 35% to 96%), although infection rates were similar. Graft survival at 36 months was improved in vaccinated recipients of cadaver kidneys (8 of 16) compared with unvaccinated recipients (4 of 16) (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Previous vaccination of seronegative renal transplant recipients with live cytomegalovirus results in reduction of disease severity mimicking the action of naturally derived immunity. 
5	Somatostatin prevents acute pancreatitis after pancreatic duct sphincter hydrostatic balloon dilation in patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether prophylactic somatostatin infusion can prevent pancreatitis after hydrostatic balloon dilation of the pancreatic duct sphincter segment in 16 patients with idiopathic recurrent pancreatitis. This study demonstrated that prophylactic administration of somatostatin before, during, and after the procedure diminished the incidence and severity of acute pancreatitis. We recommend consideration of such prophylaxis in patients undergoing this procedure. 
1	Management of symptomatic lymphocele via percutaneous drainage and sclerotherapy with tetracycline. Lymph collections following pelvic surgery are usually asymptomatic, but may occasionally produce symptoms requiring invasive therapy. We have successfully obliterated a large lymphocele by employing percutaneous drainage and instilling tetracycline. 
1	Nasopalatine duct cyst: an analysis of 334 cases. The nasopalatine duct cyst (NPDC) is the most common cyst of nonodontogenic origin in the maxilla. However, the information reported about this lesion consists primarily of small surveys and isolated case reports. The purpose of this retrospective investigation was to gather demographic, clinical, and histologic data on a large series of NPDCs, and to compare the findings with those of previous studies. In this study, the overall mean age at diagnosis was 42.5 years, and there was a slight male predilection. The mean radiographic diameter was 17.1 mm, but 75% of the lesions were 20 mm or less in diameter. Symptoms were present in at least 70% of the cases. Only 28% of the specimens contained respiratory epithelium. There was no correlation between radiographic size, patient's age, presenting symptoms, or type of epithelium. Recurrence was noted in only 2% of the cases. 
1	Intramedullary spinal cord germinoma: case report. A case of intramedullary spinal cord germinoma within the conus medullaris, with lumbago and pain in the lower extremities, is presented. The intramedullary spinal cord germinoma was determined by a biopsy specimen. After local irradiation of 50 Gy, the tumor markedly decreased in size and clinical symptoms disappeared. 
3	Prolonged anginal perceptual threshold in diabetes: effects on exercise capacity and myocardial ischemia. Anginal perceptual threshold (the time from onset of 0.1 mV of ST segment depression to onset of angina during treadmill exercise) is prolonged in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease. In the present study, the functional significance of this perceptual abnormality was evaluated by analysis of its effect on exercise capacity and the severity of myocardial ischemia. Treadmill exercise in 32 diabetic patients and 36 nondiabetic control patients showed a close linear correlation between the time to onset of electrical ischemia (ST segment depression) and exercise capacity in both groups (r = 0.8 and 0.9, respectively; p less than 0.001). However, the slope of the relation was flatter in the diabetic group because prolongation of the anginal perceptual threshold permitted continued exercise as ischemia intensified. The anginal perceptual threshold itself showed a close linear correlation with exercise capacity in the diabetic group (r = 0.8, p less than 0.001), although in the nondiabetic group these variables were unrelated. The permissive effect of a prolonged anginal perceptual threshold on exercise capacity is undesirable as reflected by its correlation with ischemia at peak exercise (r = 0.6, p less than 0.001): the longer the threshold, the greater the exercise capacity and the more severe the ischemia. Indeed, the inverse relation between the severity of ischemia at peak exercise and exercise capacity in the nondiabetic group (r = 0.4, p less than 0.02) was completely lost in the diabetic group. Thus, in diabetic patients with coronary artery disease, anginal perceptual threshold is a major determinant of exercise capacity. 
1	Feasibility of intraoperative cytodiagnosis of lung cancer. Of 354 thoracotomies, 114 cases involved intraoperative cytopathologic evaluation. The study included 86 men and 28 women, and 184 specimens were examined. Smears were taken from the lung lesion or lymph node and the chest wall or bronchial stump by imprint or needle aspiration. Intraoperative evaluations were compared with histologic findings. In 85 cases not diagnosed as malignant preoperatively, malignancy was confirmed in 97.6 percent of cases and histologic type in 71.8 percent. In the 28 cases diagnosed as malignant preoperatively, there was only one false-negative. The most important finding during thoracotomy is whether a lesion is malignant or not. The time required to obtain a pathologic diagnosis also is important. We are able to obtain the results of a cytologic diagnosis within 10 min. Cytologic diagnosis of malignancy during thoractomy may be a feasible and convenient method of diagnosis, especially where malignancy is suspected. 
5	Continuous extracorporeal fluid removal in children with low cardiac output after cardiac operations. Eleven hypervolemic and oliguric children with low cardiac output after cardiac operations were treated by slow continuous ultrafiltration or continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration. A mean negative fluid balance of 1.63 +/- 0.37 ml/kg/hr (standard error of the mean [SEM]) significantly improved the hemodynamic status within 59 +/- 6.1 hours (SEM). Although the central venous pressure decreased significantly from 15.2 +/- 0.84 to 8.8 +/- 0.92 mm Hg (p less than 0.0001), the mean arterial pressure increased significantly from 41.5 +/- 2.54 to 53.5 +/- 2.21 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). In addition, pH increased significantly from 7.31 +/- 0.01 (SEM) to 7.43 +/- 0.001 (SEM) (p less than 0.001) and oxygenation index (arterial oxygen tension/inspired oxygen fraction) from 119 +/- 15.2 (SEM) to 214 +/- 27.0 (SEM) (p less than 0.001). Hemodynamic improvement during slow continuous extracorporeal fluid removal allowed a significant decrease of the catecholamine infusion rate. After normovolemia had been achieved, continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration had to be continued in four children because of persistent anuria. Eight patients could be weaned from artificial ventilation and vasopressor support. Two patients died without recovery of renal function and one with restored renal function. Slow continuous ultrafiltration and continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration improve the cardiovascular function in children with low cardiac output by optimizing the preload conditions of the failing heart. In addition, they improve acid-base balance and pulmonary gas exchange. 
3	Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root. The effect of clipping on lumbar nerve root blood flow rates in the region of the nerve root canal was studied experimentally in the hog. Blood flow rate was measured using the hydrogen washout technique. When the entrance zone was clipped with a microvascular clip, blood flow rate of the nerve root was decreased by 37% in comparison with the initial control rate; clipping at the exit zone reduced blood flow rate by 69%. Blood flow direction in the lumbar nerve root within the nerve root canal was found to be predominantly proximal. The current data indicate that the more lateral the impingement of the nerve root occurs, the more ischemic changes are induced. 
4	The tangled web of coronary risk factors. Although epidemiologic, genetic, and pathophysiologic studies have shown that low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are involved in the development of coronary artery disease, the standard measurement of LDL cholesterol comprises a number of separate components that may contribute in different ways to the disease process. Some of these components appear to be of particular pathologic importance. Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs) and lipoprotein (a) are highly atherogenic species that each normally account for up to 10% to 15% total LDL cholesterol but may be disproportionately elevated in pathologic states and may therefore contribute disproportionately to coronary disease risk in certain patients. Recently, another subclass of LDL, characterized by relatively small particle size and increased density, also has been found to be associated with relatively increased risk of coronary disease. Furthermore, levels of this subclass, designated LDL-III, are linked to a number of interrelated hormonal and metabolic factors, each of which have also been associated with risk of coronary artery disease. These include male gender, postmenopause, abdominal adiposity, elevated triglyceride levels, increased levels of apolipoprotein B, and reductions in high-density lipoproteins (HDLs), particularly in the HDL2 subclass. Other studies have demonstrated that many of these factors are also commonly associated with relative insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Thus, a lipoprotein profile characterized by a relative increase in LDL-III and a reduction in HDL2 is indicative of a constellation of metabolic features that defines a high-risk state and that makes it extremely difficult to single out one or more factors that are most directly involved in the disease process. Combinations of genetic and environmental factors acting on this "tangled web" of risk factors may account for much of the variation in coronary disease susceptibility found in the general population. 
5	Identification of viruses in a study of acute respiratory tract infection in children from Uruguay. For the purpose of identifying viral agents associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in children less than 5 years old, a longitudinal community study was undertaken in Montevideo, Uruguay, from May 1985 to December 1987. This report includes results obtained by cell culture and immunofluorescence techniques for detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza 1 and 3 viruses, and adenovirus. Two populations were studied: children visited at home by pediatricians (group 1) and children with an ARI episode who attended an outpatient clinic (group 2). Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained at the time of an ARI episode: 858 from group 1 and 488 from group 2. Viruses were identified in 15.3% of group 1 specimens and in 17.6% of group 2 specimens. RSV was the most frequently recovered agent, accounting for 67.9% and 58.1%, respectively, of all viruses detected. The sensitivity and specificity of RSV isolation by cell culture are compared with detection by indirect immunofluorescence. 
1	Correlation of ultrasound guided and digitally directed transrectal biopsies of palpable prostatic abnormalities. The authors evaluated 51 patients with palpable prostatic abnormalities detected during digital rectal examination. These findings consisted of a nodule or an area of induration. Each palpable abnormality was confined to 1 prostatic lobe and there was no suggestion of extracapsular extension of neoplasm or systemic metastatic disease. All patients underwent 7.0 MHz. sagittal ultrasound guided transrectal biopsy followed by digitally directed transrectal biopsy. Biopsies were obtained only from the area of interest. The procedure was performed in the outpatient clinic without use of sedation or anesthesia. Digitally directed biopsies were positive for adenocarcinoma in 9 lesions. Ultrasound guided biopsies detected adenocarcinoma in 23 lesions, including all those detected by the blind digitally directed technique. This study demonstrates greater diagnostic accuracy using 7.0 MHz. ultrasound guided techniques and its routine use is warranted in the evaluation of palpable prostatic abnormalities. 
1	High cardiac output as a paraneoplastic syndrome. A high cardiac output (17 1 min-1) was recorded in a young man suffering from lymphoplasmatocytotic lymphoma. The evolution of the blood disease was characterized by two relapses, during which clinical signs of heart failure were prominent but resolved with efficient blood chemotherapy. The known aetiologies of high cardiac output were excluded. The complete normalization of the cardiac parameters with blood remission suggests that the high cardiac output represented an unusual paraneoplastic syndrome, the pathogenesis of which still remains unknown, although several hypotheses were tested. 
3	Fungal pseudomeningitis superimposed on Escherichia coli meningitis. Pseudomeningitis is the demonstration of microorganisms from the cerebrospinal fluid by stain or culture in a patient with symptoms suggesting meningitis. This is a report of fungal pseudomeningitis superimposed on a case of nosocomial Escherichia coli meningitis resulting from a neurosurgical procedure. Critical care personnel need to be aware of the possibility of pseudomeningitis with or without associated meningitis in the appropriate setting. 
5	Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage associated with progressive systemic sclerosis. A 41 year old man with an eight year history of progressive systemic sclerosis developed severe diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and died. The importance of diffuse alveolar haemorrhage as a rare but potentially serious complication of connective tissue disease should not be overlooked. 
4	Unnecessary deaths from valvular aortic stenosis. The annual mortality from aortic valvular stenosis was calculated among potential candidates for surgical replacement of the aortic valve. From the Swedish Central Register of Causes of Death, 70 patients below the age of 80 years who had died from aortic stenosis during a 1-year period in the County of Stockholm (population 1.5 million), were identified. A retrospective analysis of their medical records showed that 37 individuals were suitable candidates for surgery. The presence of aortic stenosis had been verified at autopsy in 31 (84%) patients. The remaining six patients (16%) had their aortic stenosis diagnosis established by a thorough non-invasive investigation performed before death. Although typical signs and symptoms of aortic stenosis were recorded in all 37 patients, only six (16%) of them had been considered by their physicians to be suitable candidates for surgery prior to death. The deceased patients were compared with a group of 68 patients who had undergone aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis during the same period. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to symptoms and clinical findings, except for a higher incidence of syncope in the operated group. It is concluded that, of 105 (68 surgically treated and 37 deceased) eligible patients with aortic stenosis, 37 individuals did not receive surgical care in time. The reason for this was probably insufficient knowledge of the curability of the disease.
