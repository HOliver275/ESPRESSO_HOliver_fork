1	Effects of energy restriction on mouse mammary tumor virus mRNA levels in mammary glands and uterus and on uterine endometrial hyperplasia and pituitary histology in C3H/SHN F1 mice. We investigated the effects of energy restriction on the pituitary-ovarian axis and on a hormone responsive gene, the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). Female C3H/SHN F1-hybrid mice, known to display a high incidence of mammary tumors, ate an energy-restricted diet (48 kcal/wk) or a control diet (95 kcal/wk) beginning at the time of weaning. By 67 wk of age, 12 of 32 mice in the control group, but none of the 33 mice in the energy-restricted group, had developed mammary tumors. Six tumor-free mice from each group were studied in detail at 67 wk of age. All six tumor-free control mice, but none of the six energy-restricted mice, showed uterine endometrial hyperplasia at autopsy. Mice subjected to energy restriction did not display an estrous cycle. The average levels of MMTV mRNA in mammary glands and uteri were strongly reduced by energy restriction. MMTV mRNA levels in mammary glands from control mice were two orders of magnitude lower than those in mammary tumors. Energy restriction lowered the percentage of pituitary mammatropes and suppressed proliferation of mammatropes with advancing age. Energy restriction thus appeared to inhibit endometrial hyperplasia and to decrease MMTV production at the mRNA level in the mammary glands and in the uterus. These effects may be a consequence of hormonal changes originating at the pituitary-ovarian axis. 
5	Should you cancel the operation when a child has an upper respiratory tract infection? Cancelling an operation when a child has an upper respiratory tract infection (URI) is not always feasible or practical. Yet we know very little about the additional risk posed by a URI occurring in a child undergoing anesthesia and surgery. Using a large prospectively collected pediatric anesthesia database, we studied 1283 children with a preoperative URI and 20,876 children without a URI. We found that children with a URI were two to seven times more likely to experience respiratory-related adverse events during the intraoperative, recovery room, and postoperative phases of their operative experience. Although these children also experienced significant disruptions in temperature regulation, they were not at risk for any other deleterious events. The elevation in risk after URI as compared with children without a URI was not explained by differences in age, physical status scores, surgical site, and emergency or elective status. However, if a child had a URI and had endotracheal anesthesia, the risk of a respiratory complication increased 11-fold (95% confidence intervals 6.8, 18.1). We conclude that the administration of general anesthesia to children with a URI is not benign and that these children require more observation/management in all perioperative phases of their surgical procedure. 
4	Dialysis considerations in the elderly patient. This brief review discusses several aspects of dialytic care pertinent to the older dialysis patient. Heart disease, nutrition, and the quality of life for these patients are considered. 
5	A randomized trial of the effect of three non-steroid anti-inflammatory agents in ameliorating cancer-induced fever. Paraneoplastic fever is well known, and is not an uncommon problem in daily practice. In an effort to ameliorate tumour-induced fever we randomized 48 patients to receive three different non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs: Naproxen (500 mg d-1), Indomethacin (75 mg d-1) or Diclophenac sodium (75 mg d-1). All patients had solid tumours, and microbial infection had been excluded. All three drugs were equally effective in bringing the temperature down to normal for a period of 30-33 d. Naproxen had the most rapid effect. In cases of fever relapse with the first drug, when the other two drugs were given instead, both proved equally effective. No side-effects were observed. We conclude that Naproxen, Indomethacin and Diclophenac sodium are equally effective in ameliorating paraneoplastic fever. In relapse, a second drug given subsequently can be effective as well. 
3	Prediction of free phenytoin levels based on [total phenytoin]/[albumin] ratios. Potential errors with hypoalbuminemia. Therapeutic monitoring of the pharmacologically active (free drug) fraction of protein-bound medications (e.g., phenytoin) represents a major diagnostic challenge in clinical and laboratory medicine. While free drug levels may be beneficial in many clinical situations, current methods for predicting free phenytoin concentrations are unreliable and not recommended for general use. The authors have demonstrated a linear relationship (r2 = 0.98) between serum levels of total and bound phenytoin in 56 patients with seizure disorders. No significant correlations were observed when total phenytoin and albumin levels were compared independently to measured concentrations of free phenytoin or percent free phenytoin. A good correlation (r2 = 0.89) existed between free phenytoin levels and [total phenytoin]/[albumin] ratios in patients with normal or elevated albumin levels, but significantly weaker correlations were found in patients with hypoalbuminemia. Thus, [total phenytoin]/[albumin] ratios may have clinical value in predicting free phenytoin levels in uncomplicated patients without hypoalbuminemia. 
1	The epithelial changes associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: a review of the clinical, histological and viral findings in 78 women. Seventy-eight excised specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were reviewed retrospectively for the presence of lichen sclerosus or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) at sites proximal to the tumour or more distant. Lichen sclerosus was evident in 61% and VIN alone in 31%. VIN III (differentiated) was associated with over 50% of the specimens with lichen sclerosus. HPV 16 was found in six of the 11 VIN lesions, investigated but in none of the six with lichen sclerosus. 
4	Clinical experience with doxazosin in general medical practice in New Zealand. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of doxazosin treatment in a large population of patients (n = 336) with essential hypertension and assessed the effect of doxazosin on the serum lipid profile and the calculated risk of developing coronary heart disease. Patients were assigned to two groups: those with a baseline diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 95 mm Hg (group 1) and those with a baseline diastolic blood pressure less than 95 mm Hg (group 2) that was controlled by previous antihypertensive therapy. Doxazosin treatment (monotherapy in 76.2% of patients) significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the blood pressure of patients in group 1 (-23/-17 mm Hg) after 10 weeks and maintained the control of blood pressure for patients in group 2. Heart rate was essentially unchanged in both groups. Mean final daily doses of 3.6 and 3.2 mg were achieved in groups 1 and 2, respectively. Treatment with doxazosin improved the severity category of hypertension for 88.4% of patients in group 1; 87.3% of patients were considered a therapy success. Doxazosin had a favorable effect on the serum lipid profile in both groups of patients. The majority of lipid changes achieved statistical significance and resulted in a significant 27% decrease in the calculated risk of developing coronary heart disease. Doxazosin was well tolerated; only 24.1% of patients had side effects that were related or possibly related to treatment. In nine (2.7%) patients the dose of doxazosin was reduced and 26 (7.7%) patients withdrew from doxazosin therapy because of side effects. 
4	Nimodipine after resuscitation from out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation. A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized trial. One hundred fifty-five consecutive patients resuscitated after out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation by a physician-manned advanced life support unit were randomly assigned to receive nimodipine or placebo at a dosage of 10 micrograms/kg as an intravenous injection immediately after restoration of spontaneous circulation, followed by an infusion of 0.5 micrograms/kg per minute for 24 hours. No significant difference was found in the 1-year survival rate of nimodipine-treated (30 [40%] of 75 patients) and placebo-treated patients (29 [36%] of 80 patients). Recurrent ventricular fibrillation during the treatment occurred in one patient in the nimodipine group compared with 12 patients in the placebo group. In a post hoc analysis of patients with very long delays in advanced life support (more than 10 minutes), the 1-year survival rate was higher with nimodipine (eight [47%] of 17 patients) than with placebo (two [8%] of 26 patients). Nimodipine may be of benefit in patients with delayed resuscitation. 
5	Iatrogenic injuries of peripheral nerves. In this study, we discuss 68 cases in which peripheral nerve trunks were inadvertently divided by surgeons. Most of these accidents occurred in the course of planned operations. Delay in diagnosis and in effecting repair was common. We list the nerves particularly at risk and the operations in which special care is needed. We recommend steps to secure prompt diagnosis and early treatment. 
1	Secretory carcinoma of the breast. Most studies of secretory carcinoma of the breast have been single case reports or separate analyses of the problem in either children or adults. We studied 10 female patients, aged 5 to 87 years. Most patients presented with a palpable mass, often near the areola. Five of six tumors were estrogen receptor negative; three analyzed for progesterone receptor were positive. Histologic patterns present in varying proportions were "classic" secretory carcinoma with microacini, abundant secretion with papillary features, and with prominent solid and papillary apocrine features. The tumors had strong reactivity for alpha-lactalbumin, S100, and carcinoembryonic antigen (polyclonal) and were negative for gross cystic disease fluid protein and anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (monoclonal). Six patients had mastectomy; four had local excision; none had axillary nodal metastases initially. With follow-up of 3 to 72 months (mean, 47 months; median, 48 months), two patients treated by local excision had local recurrences, one patient had axillary nodal metastases. All patients are alive. Comparison of patients under and over 30 years of age revealed one important difference: younger patients had a longer interval between detection and biopsy-30 vs 2 months. Treatment recommendations are initial wide excision or quadrantectomy with low axillary dissection in most cases and, in premenarchal patients, strong effort to preserve the breast bud without jeopardizing local control. 
1	Epidermal growth factor regulates the in vitro sensitivity of human ovarian carcinoma cells to cisplatin. Cisplatin (DDP) is the most effective drug for the treatment of human ovarian cancer, but the mechanisms that determine sensitivity to the cytotoxic action of DDP are not well understood. Treatment of two human ovarian carcinoma cell lines with epidermal growth factor (EGF) simultaneously increased sensitivity to DDP and caused a persistent change in morphology in the absence of any mitogenic effect. Sensitization to DDP was shown to be dependent on both EGF concentration and EGF receptor number in C127 mouse fibroblasts expressing the human EGF receptor after transfection with a pBPV plasmid construct containing the human EGF receptor gene under control of the transferrin receptor 3'-inducible regulator. Sensitization of human ovarian carcinoma cells to DDP was not blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis. EGF did not enhance sensitivity to DDP or alter morphology in DDP-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cells despite the presence of functional EGF receptors on these cells. These results showed that elements of the signal transduction pathway activated by EGF determined cellular sensitivity to DDP, and that a DDP-resistant phenotype is associated with a defect in this signal transduction pathway. 
3	Effects of a multidisciplinary management program on neurologically impaired patients with dysphagia. Dysphagia is a major problem in patients with neurologic disorders. Aspiration pneumonia and impaired nutritional status are consequences of dysphagia that result in high morbidity and mortality rates. Assessment and treatment of the dysphagic patient by a multidisciplinary team have been advocated but to date the effects of such an approach have not been demonstrated quantitatively. This prospective study was conducted to determine if a dysphagia program would improve patients' caloric intake and body weight, decrease the instances of aspiration pneumonia, or improve patients' feeding ability. Patients were referred from a 26 bed neurology/neurosurgery unit. A time series design was utilized. The control group consisted of 15 patients (mean age = 46.1 years), managed according to the existing ward routine. Subsequently, nursing staff attended a dysphagia training program. Following this, the treated group of 16 patients, (mean age = 49.3 years) was assessed by the dysphagia team, using bedside and videofluoroscopic examinations to determine the specific swallowing disorder. An individualized treatment program was designed for each patient. The groups were compared on the basis of deviation from their baseline weight, deviation from ideal energy intake, and the incidence of aspiration pneumonia. Statistical analysis revealed that the groups were comparable in age, number of days on the study, and Glasgow Coma Scale score; and that a significant weight gain and increase in caloric intake occurred in the treated group. No incidence of aspiration pneumonia was reported in either group. We speculate that this may have been influenced by the meticulousness of the care delivered in an acute unit as well as greater attention to prevention given in both groups. 
5	Young-onset Parkinson's disease: a clinical review. Young-onset Parkinson's disease (YOPD) is arbitrarily defined as that which produces initial symptoms between the ages of 21 and 39, inclusive. The special problems and concerns of the patient with YOPD present as much of a challenge and opportunity for the clinician as the disease itself does for the researcher. In contrast to juvenile parkinsonism, which is a heterogeneous group of clinicopathologic entities presenting (also arbitrarily) before age 21, YOPD appears to be the same nosologic entity as older-onset PD. It comprises approximately 5% of referral populations in Western countries and about 10% in Japan. Its annual incidence relative to the population at risk is about 1/10 that of PD at age sixty. YOPD tends to have more gradual progression of parkinsonian signs and symptoms, earlier appearance of levodopa-related dyskinesias and levodopa-dose-related motor fluctuations, and frequent presence of dystonia as an early or presenting sign. Studies conflict with regard to the suspected greater familial frequency and lesser frequency of dementia than in older-onset PD. 
5	Unusual aspects of aortovenous fistulas associated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. Three unusual cases of an abdominal aortic aneurysm spontaneously rupturing into the retroperitoneum and an adherent posterior vein are reported. No patient demonstrated signs or symptoms of an aortovenous fistula before surgery. Emergent surgery prevented extensive preoperative diagnostic testing. The three abdominal aortic aneurysms were very large and averaged 13 cm in diameter. One fistula involved an inflammatory aneurysm, which is the fifth such case reported. The aortic fistulas were to the inferior vena cava (158 other cases reported in the English-language literature), a left renal vein (16 other cases reported), and an iliac vein (7 other cases reported). Routine use of the cell-saver, oversewing of the fistula from within the aneurysm, and a heightened awareness that this unusual complication is more common in the presence of a very large, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm should improve survival. 
3	Psychosocial, functional, and quality of life assessment of patients with posttraumatic fracture nonunion, chronic refractory osteomyelitis, and lower extremity amputation. One hundred nine patients with long-bone fracture nonunion, chronic refractory osteomyelitis, or posttraumatic amputation were evaluated for the impact of chronic disability on quality of life, as measured by the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale (AIMS) and the Psychosocial Adjustment to Illness Scale (PAIS). A self-administered PAIS for spouses assessed psychosocial adjustment of spouses or significant others. A final questionnaire ranked the reasons for either continuing medical therapy or accepting amputation. The PAIS scores differed significantly between osteomyelitis patients and both nonunion and amputation patients (p less than .05). The presence or absence of pain produced significant differences in AIMS and PAIS scores of nonunion and osteomyelitis patients (p less than .05). Subscale analysis of AIMS scores revealed significant differences among the three groups in health perception and scale of orthopedic problem: osteomyelitis patients were more severely affected than nonunion or amputation patients. The PAIS detected no statistically significant difference in psychosocial adjustment of spouses of patients in the three population groups. The most common reason for continuing medical and surgical management of nonunion and osteomyelitis was expectation for cure. The amputee group chose ablation to avoid further treatment. Differences in psychosocial and functional ability were related to disease diagnosis, pain, status of fracture healing, and timing of amputation. 
5	Reversal of colchicine-induced mitotic arrest in Chinese hamster cells with a colchicine-specific monoclonal antibody. The ability of a high-affinity colchicine-binding monoclonal antibody to reverse the effects of colchicine on Chinese hamster ovary cells was investigated. Using flow cytometry, a complete mitotic blockade was demonstrated after 16 hours with 2.5 x 10(-7) mol/l (molar) colchicine. Colchicine-induced changes were reversible when equimolar antibody was added simultaneously with or up to 6 hours after colchicine. With further delay in addition of antibody, a progressive irreversible increase in mitotic blockade and increase in mean cell size was observed. Prolonged colchicine exposure, without antibody reversal, led to polyploidy and structural chromosome breakage. Early antibody reversal restored cells to the diploid state, whereas delayed reversal resulted in a time-dependent increase in polyploidy. Colchicine-induced polyploidy and chromosomal aberrations may be the basis for both colchicine toxicity and the time-dependent increase in irreversibility of colchicine effects. 
5	Mucocele of the cystic duct remnant in eight liver transplant recipients: findings at cholangiography, CT, and US. The case histories and radiologic studies of eight liver transplant recipients who developed a mucocele of the allograft cystic duct remnant were retrospectively evaluated. All patients had clinical and/or laboratory evidence of biliary obstruction or cholangitis from 2 weeks to 3.3 years following transplantation. Cholangiographic, ultrasound (US), and computed tomography (CT) images were available for review in eight, five, and four patients, respectively. Cholangiograms demonstrated an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct in seven of eight patients. US and CT showed fairly well- to well-defined round fluid collections adjacent to the common hepatic duct in three and two patients, respectively. The findings of this study suggest that the detection at cholangiography of an extrinsic mass compressing the common hepatic duct appears to be specific for a mucocele of the allograft cystic duct remnant. CT and US images may offer confirmatory evidence. 
4	Hemorrhoids. A practical approach to an aggravating problem. Although hemorrhoids are considered a minor medical problem, they may cause considerable discomfort and anxiety. Fortunately, treatment is often simple and surgery is rarely necessary. In this practical article, Dr Cocchiara describes internal and external hemorrhoids, a classification system, and treatment choices based on the degree of involvement. 
2	Obstructing carcinoma of the cecum. Carcinoma of the cecum, the third most common location for malignancy of the large bowel, was examined with attention centered upon cecal cancers producing obstruction. Reviewing 136 patients revealed 11 obstructing lesions (8.1%) presenting as distal small bowel obstructions. The mean age of the patients was 74 years. All but one patient had resection for cure which consisted of a right hemicolectomy with ileotransverse colostomy. There was no operative mortality or significant morbidity. Bowel obstruction due to cecal carcinoma is an infrequent occurrence arising in elderly patients and carries a poor survival rate due to advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and treatment. 
2	Cirrhosis and portal hypertension in a patient with adult Niemann-Pick disease. A woman with known Niemann-Pick disease, type B, presented at age 33 with upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, and peripheral edema. Evaluation showed massive hepatosplenomegaly, infiltration of the liver with Niemann-Pick cells, cirrhosis, and evidence of portal hypertension. Chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, thrombocyctopenia, and platelet dysfunction were treated successfully by splenectomy. Cirrhosis and portal hypertension have not been reported previously in adult Niemann-Pick disease in the absence of some other cause. 
5	Cervical lymph node metastasis: assessment of radiologic criteria. To estimate the accuracy of different radiologic criteria used to detect cervical lymph node metastasis in patients with head and neck carcinoma, seven different characteristics of 2,719 lymph nodes in 71 neck dissection specimens from 55 patients were assessed. Three lymph node diameters, their location, their number, the presence of a tumor, and the amount of necrosis and fatty metaplasia were recorded. The minimal diameter in the axial plane was found to be the most accurate size criterion for predicting lymph node metastasis. A minimal axial diameter of 10 mm was determined to be the most effective size criterion. The size criterion for lymph nodes in the subdigastric region was 1 mm larger (11 mm). Groups of three or more borderline nodes were proved to increase the sensitivity but did not significantly decrease the specificity. Radiologically detectable necrosis (3 mm or larger) was found only in tumorous nodes and was present in 74% of the positive neck dissection specimens. Shape was not a valuable criterion for the radiologic assessment of the cervical lymph node status. 
1	Renal function in obstructive jaundice in man: cholangiocarcinoma model. Renal function with respect to water clearance and renal hemodynamics was studied in 15 patients with obstructive jaundice due to cholangiocarcinoma. The results were compared with those of the control normal subjects. There was no change in renal function in the patients with mild to moderate jaundice, with total serum bilirubin from 8.0 to 15.1 mg/dl. Increased urinary sodium excretion and decreased free water and negative water clearances were observed in the patients with severe jaundice with total serum bilirubin from 27.0 to 40.4 mg/dl and normal serum albumin. Renal blood flow was normal, but creatinine clearance was decreased. In severely jaundiced patients with serum bilirubin from 30.5 to 40.1 mg/dl and hypoalbuminemia urinary sodium excretion, free water clearance, negative water clearance, renal blood flow and creatinine clearance were decreased. There was salt and water retention in this group. The findings suggest that in severe jaundice there is inhibition of sodium chloride reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop. ADH and increased hydraulic conductivity of the collecting tubules possibly contribute to decreased free water clearance. In severely jaundiced patients with hypoalbuminemia this salt losing effect is converted to salt retention by increased proximal tubular reabsorption of sodium. 
4	Cardiac rehabilitation after coronary artery bypass grafting: effects on exercise performance and risk factors. After coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 49 nonselected patients followed a cardiac rehabilitation program that included medical follow-up and physical training, both in outpatient groups and on an individual basis at home. The effect of the program on exercise test variables, coronary risk factors, and medication one year after surgery was compared to a nonexercised control group (n = 98). The study group showed less increase in the rate-pressure product, indicating a favorable effect on myocardial oxygen consumption (0.7 +/- 5.4 vs 2.8 +/- 5.6, p less than .05); a lower frequency of angina at exercise testing (6% vs 18%, p less than .01); a reduction in resting systolic and diastolic blood pressure (9/4mmHg, p less than .01); fewer smokers (6% vs 17%, p less than .05); and fewer patients taking long-acting nitrates (0% vs 10.2%, p less than .05). It is suggested, therefore, that an organized cardiac rehabilitation program may be advantageous after CABG. 
5	Splenectomy for the massively enlarged spleen. The experience at the National Cancer Institute from 1955 to 1988 with 46 cases of splenectomy for massive splenomegaly (greater than or equal to 1,500 grams) was reviewed to assess the indications, pathology, operative, and postoperative course for this procedure. The median age was 51 years. Thirty-one splenectomies (67.4%) were performed for malignancy (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 11; chronic myelogenous leukemia, 10; lymphoma, 9; hairy cell leukemia, 1), 11 for myeloid metaplasia, and four for other nonmalignant conditions. Indications for splenectomy included hypersplenism (32 patients), symptoms (6), diagnosis (3), and splenic rupture (3). A midline incision (30 patients) was most commonly used. Median operative time was 2 hours, 50 minutes. Median operative blood loss was 1,300 ml (range, 100 ml-60 units). The splenic artery was ligated initially in 16 patients (34.8%) but did not correlate with blood loss or operating time. The median splenic weight was 2,030 grams (range, 1500-5320 gm). The postoperative complication rate was 39.1 per cent (21 complications in 18 patients). This included infection in 10 patients, bleeding in six patients. Six patients required reoperation (bleeding, 4; abscess, 1; small bowel obstruction, 1 patient). The 30-day operative mortality was 19.6 per cent (9 patients). Excluding operative deaths, 35 patients were available for follow-up evaluation. Twenty-nine patients had improvement in parameters for which splenectomy was indicated. Six patients had no change in their course after splenectomy. These findings indicate that many patients with massive splenomegaly benefit from splenectomy, however, the procedure is associated with a high risk for postoperative morbidity and mortality. 
2	Indocyanine green elimination in patients with liver disease and in normal subjects. 1. The validity of a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model for the estimation of the hepatic extraction ratio of Indocyanine Green was tested in six patients with cirrhosis of the liver. 2. No agreement was found between the value of the hepatic extraction ratio measured directly and that calculated using the two-compartment model. 3. To investigate the reasons for the failure of the model, an extended sampling period was used to define the time course of Indocyanine Green in plasma in six healthy subjects and in six patients with cirrhosis of the liver after a bolus injection of the dye. 4. Indocyanine Green was measurable in the plasma for up to 10 h after injection in healthy subjects, and up to 48 h after injection in the patients. The plasma elimination curve in both groups was best described by a triexponential function. 5. The clearance of Indocyanine Green calculated using data collected in the first 20 min after injection overestimated that calculated using data collected for as long as Indocyanine Green was measurable in the plasma. In the patients with cirrhosis the mean overestimate was 87%. 6. Thus, a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model was inappropriate for the description of the disposition of Indocyanine Green and estimates of the hepatic extraction ratio obtained using this model in patients with cirrhosis were inaccurate. 
4	Medical comorbidity of major depressive disorder in a primary medical practice. Despite much speculation about the relationship between depression and medical comorbidity in primary care settings, few investigators have examined this issue empirically. Using a two-stage screening procedure, we assessed 618 patients aged 18 to 64 years in an academic general medicine clinic. Forty-one patients (6.6%) suffered from a current episode of major depressive disorder (MDD). We compared this group with a 20% random sample of nondepressed patients. While patients with MDD were younger (mean age, 41.1 vs 47.2 years), they were assessed by the Duke University Severity of Illness Scale as having more severe medical illness. Patients with MDD were more likely to have malignant tumors and "ill-defined conditions" than nondepressed patients. The 18 patients with MDD (44%) who were correctly diagnosed by their physicians had less severe medical illness than those whose depression was clinically undetected. A logistic regression model predicting MDD group membership included female gender, younger age, higher Duke University Severity of Illness Scale score, and more frequent inactive ill-defined diagnoses. These findings are consistent with assertions: (1) patients with MDD have more physical illness than nondepressed patients and/or (2) somatic symptoms and disability caused by MDD add to the burden of physical illness. 
5	Pulse oximetry during apparent tonic-clonic seizures. A pulse oximeter was used to monitor arterial oxygen saturations in 11 patients during apparent tonic-clonic seizures. 8 had a clinical diagnosis of genuine fits, 6 of whom showed striking falls in oxygen saturation during the seizures. 3 had a clinical diagnosis of pseudoseizures, none of whom had hypoxia during these episodes. Pulse oximetry during apparent tonic-clonic seizures may help to identify patients with low arterial oxygen tension who need immediate intervention. 
5	Histocompatibility testing in transplantation. The question of whether or not HLA is important in transplantation can now be answered with a definite yes. The nationwide six-antigen-matching program, in which over 100 US transplantation centers have participated, has shown that a high (88% to 90%) 1-year graft survival rate can be achieved when kidneys are shipped to well-matched recipients. Long-term outcome (measured as half-life) is also markedly improved, from an average of 7 years for cadaveric donor transplants to as much as 19 years in the six-antigen-matched recipients. One of the major factors influencing long-term survival is histocompatibility matching, as shown by the survival differences among HLA-identical siblings (25-year half-life), one-haplotype-mismatched parental donors (12-year half-life), and two-haplotype-mismatched cadaveric donors (7-year half-life). For the past 25 years of kidney transplant experience, cadaveric donor half-life has remained stable at 7 years, despite many improvements in immunosuppression protocols. Histocompatibility matching unquestionably offers the best approach to prevention of chronic rejection. 
1	Have changing treatment patterns affected outcome for operable breast cancer? Ten-year follow-up in 1288 patients, 1965 to 1978. From 1965 to 1978, 1288 patients with primary operable breast cancer were treated by the senior author, using extended radical (ERM), radical (RM), and modified radical (MRM) mastectomy operations exclusively. Results were analyzed for trends in overall and disease-free survival, and patterns of local and distant relapse, the years 1965 to 1970 versus 1971 to 1974 versus 1975 to 1978. Significant changes (p less than 0.00001) from 1965 to 1978 included progressively earlier stage of disease, less frequent use of RM and ERM, a decline in the use of postoperative radiotherapy, and the introduction in 1975 of multidrug adjuvant chemotherapy. Ten-year disease-free survival rates improved significantly for all patients (by 11%, p = 0.00004) and for node-negative (by 12%, p = 0.0024), node-positive (by 8%, p = 0.012), clinical stage II (by 15%, p = 0.0022), and pathologic stage II (by 12%, p = 0.016) disease. Ten-year local recurrence for all patients was 3% (local only) and 2% (local with distant metastasis), and survival from date of recurrence for all patients failing treatment increased two times (p less than 0.0001) for patients treated most recently. As the primary surgical treatment of breast cancer continues to become more moderate, the promise of systemic adjuvant therapies can be realized only with continued emphasis on earlier diagnosis and maximal local control of disease. 
4	Acute autonomic neuropathy. Two cases and a clinical review. Acute autonomic neuropathy is an uncommon syndrome, usually affecting healthy young people. Presentation is often dramatic and initial misdiagnosis is common. We describe two young women with acute autonomic neuropathy who presented with gastrointestinal involvement heralding widespread dysautonomia and review 26 additional cases of acute autonomic neuropathy from the English language literature. Acute autonomic neuropathy can be primarily cholinergic without orthostatic hypotension (26%) or pandysautonomic (74%) involving sympathetic adrenergic functions. Onset has been temporally related to viral syndromes in 20% of cases, with autonomic deficits usually evolving over 1 to 3 weeks. Gastroparesis (69%) and syncope (12%) are frequent presenting complaints. Spinal fluid protein levels are often (75%) elevated in pandysautonomic subtypes. Prolonged and incomplete recovery is the rule (60%), with persistent gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension. Other specific diseases that occasionally mimic acute autonomic neuropathy include botulism, porphyria, amyloidosis, and paracarcinomatous neuropathies. Acute autonomic neuropathy shares several clinical features with acute idiopathic polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome), suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis. 
1	The history of nitrite in human nutrition: a contribution from German cookery books. In order to settle the question of when saltpetre (nitrate) came in use as an additive to human food, a number of historic cookery books from Germany and Austria were reviewed. Obviously, the change from vegetable dyes to saltpetre for the coloring or color preservation, respectively, of meat occurred between 1600 and 1750, probably near 1700. The addition of sugar which favours the reduction of nitrate to the active agent nitrite became common practice during the 19th century. Thus some historic parallels to the appearance of colorectal cancer, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis in the medical literature became apparent. 
1	Stimulation of cAMP and phosphomonoester production by melanotropin in melanoma cells: 31P NMR studies. A major part of the present understanding of the molecular basis of signal transduction has been gained from in vitro studies using classical biochemical methods. In this study, we used 31P NMR spectroscopy to investigate the response of live M2R mouse melanoma cells to stimulation by melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH; melanotropin). In the presence of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and a synergistic dose of forskolin (1.67 microM), MSH induced a transient (approximately 60-min) rise in the cellular concentration of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which coincided in time with an equivalent decrease (approximately 40%) in ATP. However, no detectable change in phosphocreatine concentration was observed. Concomitantly, MSH induced a striking and unexpected increase in the concentration of three phosphomonoester (PME) metabolites (approximately 2-fold increase in total PME signal area); one signal has been assigned to phosphoethanolamine. The levels of the PMEs remained high for 2-4 hr and declined slowly (approximately 10 hr) to basal level, following perfusion with fresh culture medium. The increase in PME was also observed after stimulation with MSH alone. In contrast, stimulation with a high dose of forskolin (50 microM) and isobutylmethylxanthine (0.2 mM), although effective in stimulating the production of cAMP, did not induce the PME response. Evaluation of the cells' energetics indicated that the enhanced production of phosphoethanolamine is probably not due to ethanolamine phosphorylation. Therefore, it is likely to result from hydrolysis of phosphatidylethanolamine by a specific phospholipase C. The response of the PMEs appears to be regulated by a cAMP-independent process, suggesting the existence of an alternative transduction pathway controlled by MSH. 
1	Inhibition of pyroglutamyl peptidase II synthesis by phorbol ester in the Y-79 retinoblastoma cell. Pyroglutamyl peptidase II (EC 3.4.19.-), a highly specific membrane-bound TRH-degrading enzyme, is inactivated in Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells by exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in a biphasic manner. We have previously demonstrated a rapid decrease in pyroglutamyl peptidase II activity to 10% of the control level within 15 min, which returns to 70% of the control level by 1 h. This decrease results from enzyme phosphorylation by TPA-activated protein kinase-C. We now report a second phase of inactivation after longer exposure of cells to TPA. After 1 h, enzymatic activity slowly and progressively declined. By 7 h, only 15% of control activity remained. Cotreatment of cells with H-7, a protein kinase-C inhibitor, prevented this second phase of inactivation. Immunoblot experiments demonstrated a reduction in the amount of pyroglutamyl peptidase II in Y-79 membranes after long term exposure to TPA. Y-79 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and pyroglutamyl peptidase II was immunoprecipitated. A decreased incorporation of [35S]methionine paralleled the decrease in enzyme activity. These studies demonstrate that the second phase of inactivation after exposure to TPA is due to an inhibition of enzyme synthesis. 
4	Arterial aneurysms in children: clinicopathologic classification. Thirty-one arterial macroaneurysms in 23 pediatric-aged patients (16 boys and 7 girls) were treated at the University of Michigan. The average age at time of diagnosis was 10.2 years (range 6 months to 18 years). Vessels involved the aorta (4), as well as hepatic (1), splenic (2), gastroepiploic (1), renal (12), iliac (1), superficial femoral (4), popliteal (1), brachial (1), radial (2), and ulnar (2) arteries. Twelve children exhibited overt clinical manifestations including presence of a mass (7), local pain (3), hematemesis (1), and painless obstructive jaundice (1). Eleven children had asymptomatic lesions. Aneurysm existence was confirmed by arteriography or operation. All but one child underwent surgical therapy, with 20 long-term survivors (mean follow-up 3.5 years). One operative death occurred and one death occurred 6 years after surgery. This experience and a review of previously reported cases served as a basis for categorization of childhood aneurysmal disease as true aneurysms associated with (I) arterial infection, (II) giant-cell aortoarteritis, (III) autoimmune connective tissue disease, (IV) Kawasaki's disease, (V) Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or Marfan's syndrome, (VI) other forms of noninflammatory medial degeneration, (VII) arterial dysplasias, (VIII) congenital-idiopathic factors, as well as (IX) false aneurysms associated with extravascular events causing vessel wall injury or disruption. Knowledge of the varied clinicopathologic characteristics of arterial aneurysms in children is important in treating these patients. 
4	Immediate regional endocardial surface expansion following coronary occlusion in the canine left ventricle: disproportionate effects of anterior versus inferior ischemia. The exact time of onset of functional expansion after acute myocardial infarction/ischemia remains unclear in spite of its potential link to chronic pathologic infarct expansion and its potential implications for therapy. To examine this early change in ventricular morphology, 14 open-chest dogs were studied with two-dimensional echocardiography before and after occlusion (10 minutes) of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD, n = 7) or circumflex artery (CIRC, n = 7). The endocardial surface area (ESA) and the area of abnormal wall motion (AWM) were reconstructed from the echocardiographic data using a previously reported technique for quantitatively mapping the ESA and extent of AWM. For the total group (N = 14), the mean ESA before occlusion was 48.9 +/- 9.8 cm2, increasing to 65.7 +/- 18.9 cm2 at 10 minutes occlusion (p less than 0.001). For the LAD subgroup, the mean ESA before occlusion was 50.7 +/- 9.3 cm2, increasing to 79.1 +/- 14.1 cm2 at 10 minutes following occlusion (p less than 0.001). For the CIRC subgroup, the mean ESA before occlusion was 47.1 +/- 10.8 cm2, increasing to 52.3 +/- 12.6 cm2 at 10 minutes after occlusion (p less than 0.001). The ESA increase for the LAD subgroup was significantly larger than that of the CIRC subgroup (LAD range 14.5 to 49.9 cm2 versus CIRC range 1.5 to 9 cm2, p less than 0.0001). Coronary occlusion resulted in similarly sized regions of AWM for both subgroups (LAD, 31.3 +/- 12.2 cm2 versus CIRC, 25.9 +/- 10.3 cm2, p = n.s.). For the LAD group, the largest increase in endocardial circumference occurred within the zone of AWM at the apex (39.9 +/- 12%). The endocardial surface area therefore expands immediately after coronary occlusion and the magnitude of this process is primarily related to the site (anteroapical) rather than to the extent of AWM. 
1	Experience with cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest in the management of retroperitoneal tumors with large vena caval thrombi. From June 1984 to September 1989, 43 patients with large vena caval tumor thrombi from retroperitoneal malignancies underwent surgical treatment with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA). The primary malignancies were renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (n = 39), renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma (n = 1), adrenal pheochromocytoma (n = 1), and renal (n = 1) or retroperitoneal (n = 1) sarcoma. The level of the caval thrombus was either suprahepatic (n = 27), intrahepatic (n = 14), or subhepatic (n = 2). In all cases the primary tumor and caval thrombus were completely removed. Concomitant procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting (n = 5), pulmonary resection (n = 2), and hepatic lobectomy (n = 1). The time of circulatory arrest ranged from 10 to 44 minutes (mean, 23.5 minutes). There were two operative deaths (4.7%), neither of them due to to the use of DHCA. Major postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (30.2%). There were no ischemic or neurologic complications and no cases of perioperative tumor embolization. The median postoperative hospital stay was 9 days. Twenty-two patients (51%) are alive and enjoying a good quality of life. The 3-year patient survival rates in patients with localized (n = 24) versus metastatic (n = 15) RCC are 63.9% and 10.9%, respectively (p = 0.02). We conclude that CPB with DHCA facilities excision of retroperitoneal malignancies with large caval thrombi and provides the potential for cure with low morbidity and mortality rates. 
4	Ventricular tachycardia in two patients with AIDS receiving ganciclovir (DHPG). We report two cases of patients who developed ventricular tachycardia while receiving intravenous infusions of ganciclovir [9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-propoxy)methylguanine, DHPG]. Worsening cytomegalovirus infection prompted renewal of ganciclovir therapy under close cardiac monitoring in one of these patients, and ventricular tachycardia recurred. The close temporal relationship between administration of the drug and onset of the arrhythmias in conjunction with the absence of other factors known to predispose to arrhythmias suggest that ganciclovir may have played a role in the development of arrhythmias in these patients. The clinical courses of the patients are discussed, as are autopsy results. 
4	Left ventricular aneurysm secondary to Behcet's disease. A 16-year-old boy with Behcet's disease who was seen with thrombophlebitis of the leg was found to have coronary artery occlusion with postinfarction left ventricular aneurysm. Recurrent femoral artery aneurysms and orogenital ulceration developed in him. The diagnostic features together with successful treatment of this patient and a discussion of Behcet's syndrome are presented. 
5	Relationship among level of distraction, evoked potentials, spinal cord ischemia and integrity, and clinical status in animals. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and neurogenic-motor evoked potentials (NMEPs) were recorded after overdistraction of the spinal cord at T5-T6, T12-L1, or L3-L4. Measures of spinal cord perfusion and clinical status were also administered. Results indicated that stiffer spinal segments allowed less distraction than more flexible segments. SEPs and NMEPs were lost quickly after overdistraction in stiff segments and slowly in more flexible segments. However, SEPs were less sensitive than NMEPs to effects from overdistraction. Spinal cord perfusion and integrity were consistent with reduced perfusion and structural damage after overdistraction in stiff segments; extremely reduced perfusion but no structural changes in more flexible segments. The application of these results to the clinical situation was provided. 
2	Abnormal membrane physical properties of red cells in McLeod syndrome. McLeod red cells (RBCs) lack Kx antigens and have weak expression of the Kell antigens. Individuals who carry the McLeod phenotype have acanthocytic RBCs and a compensated hemolytic state. To elucidate the role of the protein on which the Kx antigens reside in maintaining membrane deformability, the rheologic properties of McLeod RBCs were determined by ektacytometry. RBCs were obtained from normal individuals and from four patients with McLeod syndrome. Osmotic gradient deformability profiles of McLeod RBCs showed decreased whole cell deformability. Resealed ghosts from McLeod RBCs also showed decreased deformability, partly because of the decreased cell surface area and partly because of an intrinsic membrane stiffness in this syndrome. For the measurement of membrane mechanical stability, resealed ghosts were subjected to constant high shear stress in the ektacytomer, and deformability was recorded continuously as the deformable ghosts fragmented into rigid spherical vesicles. Membranes from McLeod RBCs showed a noticeable increase in mechanical stability. Acquired causes of acanthocytosis, such as liver disease, did not cause the rheologic abnormalities observed in McLeod cells. Other abnormalities noted in McLeod RBCs were decreased RBC potassium content and an increased number of dense RBCs, as determined by centrifugation on a discontinuous density gradient. The data indicate that McLeod RBCs are rigid and have decreased surface area and that their membranes are intrinsically rigid with increased mechanical stability. These abnormalities may account for the reduced RBC survival observed in McLeod syndrome. The protein that carries the Kx surface antigen seems to be required for the maintenance of the normal physical function of RBC skeletal proteins. 
4	Treatment of complicated prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis with annular abscess formation by homograft aortic root replacement. The outcome of 30 consecutive patients with active aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis and root abscesses treated by the technique of homograft aortic root replacement with reimplantation of the coronary arteries is detailed. The principles of this technique are the removal of all abscesses and infected areas likely to drain into the infected mediastinum, excision of infected tissues down to healthy noninfected tissue and replacement with an antibiotic-impregnated homograft aortic root. All patients had evidence of progressive cardiac failure and ongoing sepsis. Mean patient age (+/- SD) at the time of operation was 42 +/- 18 years. The mean number of previous aortic valve replacements per patient was 1.6 +/- 0.7; 14 patients (47%) had undergone greater than or equal to 2 previous replacements. At operation, aortic root abscesses were found in all patients; abscess extension to adjacent structures and partial valve dehiscence had occurred in 23. In-hospital death occurred in 9 (30%) of the 30 patients. The 21 hospital survivors have been followed up for a mean of 66 +/- 42 months (range 9 to 144). Overall, 17 (81%) of the 21 hospital survivors have remained free of major adverse events (recurrence of endocarditis, need for reoperation or death). The results of our study suggest that homograft aortic root replacement should be considered favorably in the treatment of patients with aortic prosthetic valve endocarditis and root abscesses. 
5	Sympathetic neural adjustments to stress in physically trained and untrained humans. The purpose of this study was to determine if the state of physical training influences sympathetic neural activation during acute stress in humans. We recorded muscle sympathetic nerve activity (microneurography of the peroneal nerve), arterial blood pressure, and heart rate in 12 highly trained, endurance athletes (25 +/- 1 years, mean +/- SEM) and 12 untrained subjects (27 +/- 1 years) before (supine rest control) and during: 1) lower body negative pressure at -5, -10, -15, and -20 mm Hg (orthostatic stress); 2) isometric handgrip at 30% of maximum (exercise stress); and 3) hand immersion in ice water, that is, the cold pressor test (thermal stress). Body weight was not different in the two groups, but the athletes had a lower body fat content (8.9 +/- 1.3% versus 16.1 +/- 2.0%, p less than 0.05). During supine rest, muscle sympathetic nerve burst frequency (24 +/- 3 versus 24 +/- 2 bursts/min, athletes versus untrained subjects) and burst incidence (36 +/- 3 versus 44 +/- 4 bursts/100 heart beats) and arterial blood pressure were not different in the two groups, but heart rate was lower in the athletes (54 +/- 2 versus 67 +/- 3 beats/min, p less than 0.05). 
5	Myosin expression in hypertrophied fast twitch and slow tonic muscles of normal and dystrophic chickens. Disruption of the development program of myosin gene expression has been reported in chicken muscular dystrophy. In the present report, the relationship between muscular dystrophy and the ability of muscle to respond to an increased work load with a transition in the myosin phenotype has been investigated. Hypertrophy of slow tonic anterior latissimus dorsi (ALD) and fast twitch patagialis (PAT) muscles was induced by overloading for 35 days and myosin expression was analyzed by electrophoresis and immunocytochemistry. Normal and dystrophic chicken ALD muscles have nearly identical proportions of SM-1 and SM-2 isomyosins and both exhibit an age-related repression of the SM-1 isomyosin which is enhanced and accelerated by overloading. Immunocytochemistry with anti-myosin heavy chain (MHC) antibodies demonstrates the appearance of nascent myofibers in overloaded ALD muscles from both normal and dystrophic chickens. A minor fast twitch fiber population is also identified which doubles in number with overloading in normal ALD muscles. There are only half as many fast twitch fibers in control dystrophic ALD muscles and this number does not increase with overloading. In contrast to ALD muscles, the isomyosin profile of normal and dystrophic PAT muscles is quite different. There is significantly more FM-3 and significantly less FM-1 isomyosin in the dystrophic PAT muscle. However, both normal and dystrophic PAT muscles exhibit an overload-induced accumulation of the FM-3 isomyosin. Immunocytochemistry reveals that, unlike the normal PAT muscle, the dystrophic PAT muscle contains a population of myofibers which express slow MHCs. As in the ALD muscle, overload-induced hypertrophy is associated with a repression of the SM-1 MHC in these fibers. Nascent myofiber formation does not occur in either normal or dystrophic overloaded PAT muscles. 
5	Modification of stroke susceptibility by genotype-dependent maternal influences. The influence of the prenatal and postnatal maternal environment on stroke susceptibility was evaluated by reciprocally crossing the spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS/Jr) inbred rat strains to produce reciprocal F1 hybrids that were nurtured, respectively, during prenatal and postnatal life by SHR or SS/Jr mothers. Following placement on a high-salt diet containing 8% NaCl at 35 days of age, F1 rats reared by SHR mothers had shorter survival times and were more likely to die with cerebral hemorrhage than F1s reared by SS/Jrs. Across reciprocal F1 female groups, enhanced susceptibility to stroke was associated with greater elevations of systolic blood pressure, but this association was not seen across reciprocal F1 male groups. There was also an association between blood pressure and stroke within each F1/gender subgroup: Rats eventually suffering strokes developed higher blood pressure after placement on the high-salt diet than rats that did not suffer stroke. Lower day 35 body weights (before exposure to the high-salt diet) were associated with greater likelihood of stroke both across the reciprocal F1 groups, and within three of the four F1/gender subgroups. The differences in stroke susceptibility between the reciprocal F1 groupings may be due to systematic differences in the prenatal and/or postnatal environments of SHR and SS/Jr mothers and may be mediated by variations in the nutritive capacity of the two inbred mothers. 
1	Disposable attachments in cryosurgery: a useful adjunct in the treatment of HIV-associated neoplasms. During cryosurgery of different types of lesions in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection, it is crucial that the possibility of secondary bacterial infection be reduced. The use of disposable attachments during cryosurgery can reduce this risk of transmission of infectious agents. These attachments are discussed. 
3	Strokes in Asians and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Stroke in Asian and Pacific-Islander populations remains the principal cause of death among adults, but its incidence in the United States approximates that of Caucasians. Although controversial, uncontrolled hypertension in certain population groups (e.g., northern Japanese) and high dietary saturated fat in others (e.g, Pacific-Islanders) are believed to be responsible for the high stroke incidence rates. The recent reduction in stroke frequency rates in these areas is thought to be the result of better hypertension control. In the Ni-Hon-San Study, the level of hypertension and its frequency were similar in Hawaii and Japan, but ischemic infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage were less frequent in Hawaii. Reduced meat and fat intake may contribute to small vessel disease in Japan. Stroke is the third major cause of death among Hispanic-Americans and Native Americans, yet there is a paucity of information, especially about stroke, in subgroups of these populations. There is also considerable ignorance and controversy about risk factors for stroke in these populations. The need for additional research is urgent. 
1	A phase I study including pharmacokinetics of polyethylene glycol conjugated interleukin-2. A more soluble formulation of recombinant interleukin-2 with a prolonged half-life would allow alternate routes or schedules of administration and enhance patient comfort. The covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol to recombinant interleukin-2 provides an analog with preclinical data suggesting those desired characteristics while maintaining biologic activity. This is the report of a phase I study in which we sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose of polyethylene glycol interleukin-2, observe biologic activity, and confirm the prolonged half-life in vivo. Sixty-six patients were entered into the study during 19 months. Polyethylene glycol interleukin-2 was administered intravenously once a week over 15 minutes. The maximum tolerated dose was 20 x 10(6) U/M2. The pattern of toxicity was quite similar to that of the parent compound. Four patients had evidence of tumor regression (three partial remission; one minor response). The pharmacokinetic data confirmed a 10- to 20-fold prolongation in half-life compared with recombinant interleukin-2. No neutralizing antibodies were detected. This study provides sufficient impetus for the ongoing phase II studies of polyethylene glycol interleukin-2. 
5	Soluble histocompatibility antigen class I in breast cancer patients in relation to tumor burden. Serum beta-2 microglobulin (B-2M) levels were studied in 365 breast cancer patients and 210 age-matched controls. The patients were divided into three groups: Group A, new patients at diagnosis; Group B, patients at follow-up; and Group C, metastatic patients. The mean B-2M of all breast cancer patients plus or minus one standard deviation (3.5 +/- 1.2; range, 1.1 to 5.9) was significantly higher than normal controls (1.29 +/- 0.49; range, 0.3 to 2.3; P less than 0.005). When the three patient groups were compared with each other, the mean B-2M level of Group A (3.0 +/- 1.5; range, 0.9 to 6.9) was similar to that of Group C (4.22 +/- 1.1; range, 2.0 to 6.4). The mean B-2M of both Groups A and C was significantly higher than that of Group B (2.38 +/- 1.02, range, 0.4 to 5.4; P less than 0.001). In Group A the mean B-2M decreased significantly after a 12-month period and reached the mean level of Group B but not that of normal controls. When patients in Group B were analyzed by their stage of disease at diagnosis, there was no significant difference between Stages I and II. There was a significant difference in the mean B-2M levels between Stages I and III. In relapsing patients, mean B-2M levels increased. These findings suggest that serum B-2M levels may reflect tumor burden, and even in patients at follow-up, occult tumor cells may activate the immune system. 
1	Failure to limit quantities of benzodiazepine hypnotic drugs for outpatients: placing the elderly at risk. PURPOSE: The long-term use of benzodiazepine hypnotics by the elderly is associated with serious side effects, and prescriptions of large quantities of these agents allow such use. Therefore, we determined the quantities of these agents prescribed to outpatients in our Veterans Administration teaching hospital, and the relationship of patient age to total number of doses prescribed per prescription. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pharmacy and patient records related to 655 consecutive prescriptions for triazolam (Halcion) and flurazepam (Dalmane) were reviewed. Only 266 (41%) of the prescriptions were for 30 or fewer doses, while 178 (27%) were written for 180 or more doses. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of prescriptions for patients aged 65 years or older were for 180 or more doses, compared with 24% for those aged 45 to 64 years old, and 16% of the prescriptions for patients less than 45 years old (p less than 0.0001). In a multivariate analysis controlling for six other factors related to the total number of doses prescribed, patients aged 65 years or older were still more likely to receive a prescription for 180 or more doses (relative risk 1.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3, 2.8). CONCLUSION: We conclude that inappropriately large quantities of benzodiazepine hypnotics were commonly prescribed, and that patients aged 65 years or older were at greatest risk for receiving such prescriptions. 
5	Philadelphia chromosome and monosomy 7 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. During an 8-year period, 3,638 children from institutions of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fifty-seven patients had Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph1) ALL. Blast cells obtained at diagnosis from 13 of these 57 cases (23%) were also found to have partial or complete monosomy 7 (-7). This subgroup of children with Ph1/-7 ALL was comprised primarily of older males with early B-lineage ALL. Bone marrow specimens from six Ph1/-7 patients were studied further using the polymerase chain reaction and primers that flank the ALL, and chronic myelogenous leukemia breakpoints to determine the molecular characteristic of the 9;22 translocation. Rearrangements were detected in RNA from bone marrow and/or peripheral blood cells of six patients, although four were in hematologic remission at the time of the analysis. Five cases showed the ALL breakpoint, while one child with Ph1/-7 showed the chronic myelogenous leukemia breakpoint. The induction failure rate was much higher in this subgroup (31%) as compared with Ph1-negative cases, and the projected duration of event-free survival reflected the aggressive nature of this subgroup because no children are projected to remain in remission at 2 years. ALL with both the 9;22 translocation and -7 appears to represent a unique and previously undescribed subgroup of childhood ALL associated with a particularly adverse outcome. Leukemic transformation in such patients may involve the interaction of a dominant oncogene (Ph1) and a tumor suppressor gene (-7). 
5	Prolapse of a neovagina created by self-dilatation. In patients with congenital absence of the vagina, a neovagina may be created by either operative or nonoperative techniques. A 25-year-old patient with a neovagina created by self-dilatation developed complete prolapse of the neovagina with an enterocele. A transabdominal sacral colpopexy successfully suspended the vaginal vault and allowed the patient to resume sexual function. 
1	Intra-abdominal desmoid tumors in familial polyposis coli: a case report of tumor regression by prednisolone therapy. A case of intra-abdominal desmoid tumors in familial polyposis coli (FPC), which regressed and disappeared by prednisolone treatment, is reported. A 37-year-old Japanese man with abdominal lumps was admitted to our hospital. He had had proctocolectomy two years before because of FPC with rectal cancer. At laparotomy, tumors were present in the abdominal wall, mesentery, and retroperitoneum. Only a small part of the tumors was resected and diagnosed microscopically to be desmoid tumors. With prednisolone administration (20 to 5 mg/day) subjective symptoms were ameliorated and desmoid tumors slowly regressed. Bilateral hydronephrosis continued and resulted in "retroperitoneal fibrosis." To our knowledge, this case is the first well-documented case of retroperitoneal fibrosis in a patient with FPC. The characteristics of the desmoid tumor in familial polyposis coli or in Gardner's syndrome and the methods for its management are discussed. 
1	Epidemiology of primary osteogenic sarcoma in the San Francisco Bay Area of California. This epidemiologic study represents an analysis of all registered new cases of osteogenic sarcoma (OGS) during the 14-year period from January 1973 to December 1986 in five San Francisco Bay counties. Inclusion into the study was limited to patients who were diagnosed in the first three decades of life and who were residents within the Bay Area at the time of diagnosis. To determine epidemiologic characteristics of OGS, records on 96 patients from the Bay Area Resources for Cancer Control with histologically proven OGS were reviewed. The incidence of OGS was influenced by age, gender, and race, but none of the effects were statistically significant. A geographic variation in the incidence of OGS was discovered, although it was not statistically significant. The results are presented in support of a continued search for environmental variables that may someday reveal the etiologic factors of OGS. 
1	Detection of primary colorectal cancer with indium 111 monoclonal antibody B72.3. B72.3 is a murine monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin subclass IgG1 directed against TAG-72, a cell surface antigen present on colorectal carcinoma cells. We investigated the utility of scanning with indium 111-labeled B72.3 in 16 patients with a high clinical suspicion of or biopsy-proven primary colorectal cancer. Each patient received 1 or 2 mg of B72.3 monoclonal antibody labeled with 152 MBq of indium 111. Patients underwent scanning 2 to 3 days and 7 days after infusion by planar and emission computed tomography. Nineteen lesions were confirmed in 12 patients. Three patients with benign polyps had true-negative monoclonal antibody scans. Indium 111-labeled imaging of B72.3 detected nine of 19 lesions. Unsuspected tumor sites were identified by monoclonal antibody scan in three patients. By detection of additional abdominal disease and extra-abdominal spread, indium 111-labeled scanning of B72.3 directly affected treatment in 18% of patients. 
2	Effect of weight reduction on hepatic abnormalities in overweight patients. The effects of weight reduction on hepatic test results and physical findings related to the liver were retrospectively evaluated in 39 overweight patients screened to exclude other factors affecting the liver. An additional 11 overweight patients with primary liver disease were retrospectively evaluated to compare the effect of weight reduction in patients with liver disease with its effect in those without primary liver disease. This study showed that in overweight adults without primary liver disease, a weight reduction of greater than or equal to 10% corrected abnormal hepatic test results, decreased hepatosplenomegaly, and resolved some stigmata of liver disease. In similarly studied overweight patients with primary liver disease, some findings improved, but the changes did not correlate with a greater than or equal to 10% weight loss. Increased alanine aminotransferase activity was the most frequent hepatic enzyme abnormality in this population. For every 1% reduction in body weight, alanine aminotransferase activity improved by 8.1%. After other causes of liver disease are eliminated by clinical and biochemical parameters, weight reduction should be tried for overweight patients with abnormal hepatic test results in the absence of obvious primary liver disease as judged by clinical and biochemical parameters before extensive and expensive studies are undertaken. 
5	Roseola infantum and other syndromes associated with acute HHV6 infection. Eight cases of acute human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV6) infection in infants were diagnosed serologically by the demonstration of IgM anti-HHV6 (8/8) and a significant change in total anti-HHV6 antibody titre (6/8). Four infants were sufficiently ill to require admission to hospital and further investigations: one with encephalitis and three with gross hepatosplenomegaly, two of whom had evidence of simultaneous infection with another herpes-virus. The remaining four infants had an illness compatible with roseola infantum, although this diagnosis had not been made clinically. Sera from two of those infants with rash had been sent for analysis to exclude rubella because the infants' mothers were pregnant. The other two had received antibiotics when febrile, and the subsequent appearance of the roseola rash had raised the possibility of antibiotic allergy. The data suggest that there are clinical syndromes in addition to roseola infantum associated with the presence of IgM anti-HHV6, in which serological screening for evidence of acute HHV6 infection may be useful. 
5	Sudden death in young competitive athletes: clinicopathologic correlations in 22 cases. PURPOSE: To investigate the pathologic substrates of sudden death in young competitive athletes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two cases of sudden death in young competitive athletes occurring in the Veneto region (northern Italy) in the period January 1979 to December 1989 were studied by postmortem examination. The athletes included 19 males and three females, ranging in age from 11 to 35 years (mean, 23 years). RESULTS: In 18 cases, sudden death occurred during (16 cases) or immediately after (two cases) a competitive sport activity. In 10 subjects, sudden death was apparently the first sign of disease. Postmortem examination disclosed that this fatality was due to arrhythmic cardiac arrest in 17 cases; among these, right ventricular cardiomyopathy, also known as "right ventricular dysplasia," was the most frequently encountered cardiovascular disease (six cases), followed by atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (four cases), conduction system pathology (three cases), anomalous origin of right coronary artery from the wrong aortic sinus (two cases), and mitral valve prolapse (two cases). In two athletes, the abrupt lethal complication was "mechanical" and consisted of pulmonary embolism and rupture of the aorta; in three athletes, death was due to a cerebral cause. All athletes with right ventricular cardiomyopathy died during effort, and most had a history of palpitations and/or syncope. Whenever available, electrocardiographic (ECG) tracings showed inverted T waves in precordial leads and/or left bundle branch block ventricular arrhythmias. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicopathologic correlations indicate that in the Veneto region of Italy, right ventricular cardiomyopathy is not so rare among the cardiovascular diseases associated with the risk of arrhythmic cardiac arrest, and seems to account for the majority of cases of sudden death in young athletes; this disorder can be suspected during life on the basis of prodromal symptoms and ECG signs. 
5	Bilateral impairment of somesthetically mediated object recognition in humans Thirty adult patients (six in each of five groups--neurologically normal, lacunar infarct-related hemiparesis, unilateral thalamic lacunar infarction, right cortical infarction with mild left hemineglect, and extensive right cortical infarction with severe left hemineglect) were asked to perform various tasks that encompassed basic and intermediate somatosensory functions and tactile and visual object recognition. Patients with thalamic and cortical infarctions had severe impairment of contralateral hand-mediated somatosensory functions in all three categories of somesthetic tasks, although patients with cortical infarction were more impaired on the object recognition task than were patients with thalamic infarction. Patients with extensive damage to the right hemisphere and severe left hemineglect also had impairment of somesthetically mediated object recognition in the ipsilateral hand despite normal basic and intermediate somatosensory function and visually mediated object recognition analogous to unilateral tactile agnosia. All other groups had normal ipsilateral tactile object recognition. 
5	Extracorporeal photopheresis in psoriasis vulgaris: clinical and immunologic observations. Four patients with chronic refractory plaque-type psoriasis without arthropathy were treated with extracorporeal photopheresis every other week for 6 to 13 months. In patients 1 and 2, methotrexate was administered concomitantly during the initial part of the trial; the dose was gradually tapered and the drug was discontinued by 6 months. Both patients improved to 23% and 62% of baseline values for percentage of body surface involvement, but their disease then flared when maintenance extracorporeal photopheresis was used alone. Substantial improvement again occurred when lower doses of methotrexate were administered with extracorporeal photopheresis. Patients 3 and 4 were treated initially with extracorporeal photopheresis alone and both improved to 50% and 52% of baseline body surface involvement, respectively, after 4 months of treatment. However, their disease flared because of factors unrelated to treatment. Extracorporeal photopheresis was well tolerated by all patients without evidence of overt toxicity. However, prolonged treatment with extracorporeal photopheresis/methotrexate was accompanied by a decrease in skin reactivity to recall antigens and by decreased capacity of lymphocytes to produce interleukin 2 in response to polyclonal stimuli in vitro. These findings indicate that alternate-week extracorporeal photopheresis has a definite but incomplete suppressive effect on psoriasis vulgaris that may be mediated through an effect on lymphokine production by photomodified cells and that the therapeutic effect of extracorporeal photopheresis may be enhanced by concomitant administration of low doses of methotrexate. 
5	Implication of specific DQB1 alleles in genetic susceptibility and resistance by identification of IDDM siblings with novel HLA-DQB1 allele and unusual DR2 and DR1 haplotypes. Genetic susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is associated with the HLA-DR3 and DR4 haplotypes. The HLA-DR2 haplotype is negatively associated with IDDM, an association that has been interpreted as dominant protection. Here, we describe the molecular analysis of the HLA class II genes in an unusual family with three HLA-DR1/2 siblings, all of whom have IDDM. With polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis to characterize the class II alleles, we identified a novel DQB1 allele on the DR1 haplotype and an unusual DQB1 allele on the DR2 haplotype. However, the DRB1 alleles on these DR1 and DR2 haplotypes are the conventional alleles (*0101 and *1501, respectively). These results suggest that it is the conventional DQB1 allele (*0602) not the DRB1 allele (*1501) on the protective DR2 haplotype that confers protection in the general population and, furthermore, that these unusual DQB1 alleles may confer susceptibility to IDDM in this family. The unusual DQB1 allele on this DR2 haplotype encodes Asp at position 57, indicating that it is the allele DQB1*0602 and not simply the presence of this residue that is responsible for the protective effect. 
5	Late volume changes in retrosternal colon bypass. Esophageal obstruction by malignancy, chemical burns, or other less common entities presents a challenge for the surgeon. Either for esophageal substitution after esophageal resection or as a bypass for the obstructed esophagus, colon interposition is often the best available option. Massive colonic enlargement requiring resection of the interposed dilated colon developed recently in 2 of our patients who had a colon bypass 22 and 10 years earlier, respectively. 
4	Detection and quantitation of ischemic left ventricular dysfunction using a new video intensity technique for regional wall motion evaluation. Eighty patients with ischemic heart disease and 17 normal subjects were evaluated for left ventricular regional wall motion by means of a new method. The wall motion analysis is based on video intensity. This technique uses a temporally sliding analysis to evaluate the cardiac cycle in 100 msec intervals. Presence of coronary artery disease was defined as more than 50% measured diameter stenosis. Wall motion abnormalities in regions perfused by stenotic vessels were most common in early diastole (76%). Sensitivity of this method at rest in patients with coronary artery disease was 79.7% (p less than 0.0001) and overall accuracy was 84.2% (p less than 0.0001). Abnormalities in both systole and diastole were more common in regions perfused by severe lesions (greater than 75%) than in those perfused by moderately stenotic (less than 75%) vessels (p less than 0.05). A comparison of the new method with phase and amplitude analysis was performed in 15 patients and with two-frame analysis in 40 patients. This new method yielded a higher sensitivity than either of the other two methods. 
5	Perioperative arrhythmias after Fontan repair. Arrhythmias are well-recognized sequelae of the Fontan repair. A prospective analysis of perioperative arrhythmias after Fontan repair was performed. Thirty-three patients had 24-hour ambulatory monitoring on the day before surgery and for 24 hours immediately after surgery; the 27 surviving patients had an additional 24-hour study on the seventh postoperative day. The most common preoperative rhythm was normal sinus, which was present in 79%. Hemodynamically significant preoperative arrhythmias were present in only two patients-atrial flutter (n = 1) and complete heart block (n = 1). Other asymptomatic preoperative arrhythmias included ectopic atrial rhythm (n = 2), supraventricular tachycardia (n = 1), accelerated junctional rhythm (n = 1), and frequent ventricular premature beats (n = 1). On the first postoperative day, the most common rhythm was accelerated junctional rhythm, which was present in 48%. Hemodynamically significant arrhythmias were present in nine patients (27%) -rapid accelerated junctional rhythm (rate, greater than 190 beats/min) (n = 3), complete heart block (n = 2), atrial flutter (n = 2), supraventricular tachycardia (n = 1), and ventricular tachycardia (n = 1). Three of six deaths occurring between postoperative days 2 and 7 were in patients with rapid accelerated junctional rhythm and associated low cardiac output. On the seventh postoperative day, the most common rhythm was normal sinus, which was present in 41%. Nine of the 27 surviving patients had complete resolution of their arrhythmias between postoperative days 2 and 7. On postoperative day 7, hemodynamically significant arrhythmias were present in four patients-atrial flutter (n = 2) and complete heart block (n = 2). 
3	Use of a central 10 degrees field and size V stimulus to evaluate and monitor small central islands of vision in end stage glaucoma. In a retrospective review of 24 clinically stable eyes with small central islands of vision due to end stage glaucoma the combined use of a central 10 degrees program and size V stimulus (10-2 with V) measured visual function undetected on a central 30 degrees field tested with both the standard size III and non-standard size V stimuli. Furthermore, the mean sensitivity of the 10-2 with V remained stable on serial field testing (mean 3.9 examinations) on long term follow-up (mean 22.2 months). This study suggests that in end stage glaucoma the size V target is the stimulus of choice and a central 10 degrees field may be the program of choice of evaluating and monitoring small central islands of vision. 
2	Synchronous carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Reports on the incidence of synchronous carcinoma of the colon and rectum have varied from 2 to 11 per cent. The variability is a result of a lack of uniformity in criteria of diagnosis, differences in the population studied and differences in time period used. In this study, we evaluated the incidence and distribution of synchronous lesions during a recent time period before the use of colonoscopy became widespread. We reviewed the records of all patients with newly diagnosed adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum who were operated upon at our institution between 1976 and 1981. In a total group of 1,000 patients of which 52 per cent were men, there were 54 patients or 5.4 per cent who had synchronous carcinomas. The group of patients with synchronous carcinomas were older than the group with nonsynchronous carcinomas (72.4 versus 68.8 years). There was also a higher incidence of associated benign polyps in the group with synchronous carcinomas (70 versus 30 per cent for a nonsynchronous carcinomas). The anatomic distribution of carcinomas of the colon and rectum in the group with synchronous lesions (111 in total) revealed a higher percentage of carcinomas located on the right side (29.7 versus 22.5 per cent), although the difference did not reach statistical significance. Synchronous carcinomas were located in nonadjacent segments of the colon in 37 per cent. There was no difference in stage between the groups with and without synchronous carcinomas. The preoperative identification of synchronous lesions by either colonoscopy or barium enema is important for the proper treatment of patients with carcinoma of the colon and rectum. Failure to locate these tumors may lead to the demise of the patient. 
5	A controlled trial of clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05% in the treatment of experimentally induced Rhus dermatitis. We studied the effectiveness of clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05% in experimentally induced Rhus dermatitis. Clobetasol rapidly decreased the vesiculation at each treated site, although the effect was most prominent at the site to which clobetasol was applied the earliest, that is, at 12 hours after exposure to Rhus extract. On the basis of this experimental model, clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05% may be effective therapy for naturally occurring Rhus dermatitis. 
4	Full recovery after a chloroquine suicide attempt. The nonfatal case of a 20 year-old woman who ingested 6 grams of chloroquine in a suicide attempt is reported. After initial ventricular fibrillation, she rapidly developed a pulmonary edema with cardiogenic shock. She was successfully treated with diazepam, epinephrine, dobutamine and mechanical ventilation. Plasma chloroquine levels showed an initial peak of 36 micrograms/mL. The patient was discharged fully recovered after 19 days. The interaction between chloroquine and diazepam is discussed, as is the need for careful management of epinephrine therapy. 
5	Gastroesophageal reflux and sclerotherapy strictures. The development of esophageal stricture is common following endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS). Gastroesophageal reflux may be at least partly responsible. Twelve randomly selected male patients underwent chronic EVS for the management of bleeding esophageal varices. Six patients developed strictures during or after EVS, six did not. There were no significant differences between stricture and nonstricture patients during 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring. Three of the six stricture patients and four of the six nonstricture patients had an abnormal amount of reflux. Gastroesophageal reflux occurs frequently in patients undergoing EVS, and it is not likely to play a major role in EVS stricture formation. 
2	Clinical recognition and evaluation of peptic ulcer disease. When a patient has epigastric pain that worsens 1 to 3 hours after meals, the possibility of peptic ulcer disease should be considered. Completely typical clinical presentations in patients younger than age 50 justify empirical therapy when no physical or laboratory findings suggest a mimicking disorder. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy should be undertaken when response to therapy is incomplete, symptoms recur quickly, or dyspeptic symptoms present for the first time in a patient older than age 50. When gastric ulcers are diagnosed radiographically, endoscopy and biopsy at multiple sites should be done to exclude malignant disease. Intractable duodenal ulcers may necessitate endoscopic biopsy of antral and duodenal mucosa to rule out an associated Helicobacter pylori infection, which may modify therapeutic approaches. Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is rare but should be suspected when ulcer disease presents atypically or aggressively or in families. Diagnosis is not difficult to confirm. 
5	Efficacy of ephedrine in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Although reported in the aerospace literature and anecdotally by anesthesiologists, the putative antiemetic effect of ephedrine remains unquantitated. We therefore prospectively studied ephedrine as an antiemetic agent in the perioperative setting in 97 patients undergoing general anesthesia for outpatient gynecologic laparoscopy. Patients were assigned in a double-blind randomized fashion to receive a standardized general anesthetic followed by an intramuscular dose of either ephedrine (0.5 mg/kg), droperidol (0.04 mg/kg), or saline before the conclusion of surgery. Nausea, retching, or vomiting, as well as the degree of sedation and discharge times, were assessed in the recovery room and for 24 h postoperatively. Ephedrine was found to have a significantly antiemetic effect (P less than 0.05) when compared with placebo and an antiemetic effect similar to that of droperidol. Sedation scores were also significantly less in the ephedrine group than in both placebo and droperidol groups. Finally, variations in mean arterial blood pressure among the three groups were not statistically significant. We conclude that ephedrine is an effective antiemetic agent with minimal sedative side effects in patients undergoing outpatient laparoscopy. 
1	Bone marrow necrosis in leukemic-phase follicular lymphoma. Bone marrow necrosis has been regarded as a rare entity in specimens obtained from living patients and has been associated with a poor prognosis. It is most commonly found in patients with neoplastic disorders, severe infections, and sickle cell anemia. We present an unusual case of a small-cleaved type follicular lymphoma associated with bone marrow necrosis and a leukemic phase occurring in a 55-year-old woman. Specimens were studied by morphologic, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and DNA hybridization techniques. 
3	Adipsic hypernatremia in two sisters. We describe two sisters with chronic hypernatremia, lack of thirst, and inappropriate osmoregulated vasopressin secretion. Only one sister, who presented with microcephaly and developmental delay, showed signs of dysplasia of the midline structures (ie, septum pellucidum and corpus callosum) and a large intracranial cyst. Neither sister showed any signs of thirst, even when osmolality exceeded 337 mmol/kg. In both patients, the vasopressin secretion did not respond to either osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli or was suppressed by a water load. Plasma osmolality values returned to normal after treatment with forced hydration and a vasopressin analogue, desamino-D-arginine vasopressin. These findings indicate a severe defect in the hypothalamic osmoreceptors that control thirst and vasopressin secretion. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such a disorder in two sisters. 
2	Giardiasis [published erratum appears in Prim Care 1991 Jun;18(2):following xii] Giardiasis represents a major protozoan infection for the 1990s. This article reviews this organism for the primary care physician, discussing the characteristics, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment. Prevention and patient education needs are also presented. 
4	Early and late tamponade with the Novacor left ventricular assist system. Cardiac tamponade can be a major complication after implantation of the Novacor left ventricular assist system (LVAS). Between 1987 and 1989, 14 patients received an LVAS as a bridge to cardiac transplantation: 3 developed early tamponade (33 +/- 12 hr postoperatively) and 5 were diagnosed with a late tamponade (9.4 +/- 3.2 days postoperatively). One patient had both early and late tamponade. Early tamponade was more common in those with increased perioperative blood loss (5,270 +/- 1,942 ml vs. 1,420 +/- 1,160 ml in other patients, p less than 0.05). Early tamponade was suggested by reduction in mean arterial pressure (74 +/- 1 to 64 +/- 3 mmHg), LVAS output (5 +/- 0.5 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 L/min), LVAS stroke volume (55 +/- 4 to 23 +/- 5 ml), and an increase in central venous pressure (13 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 mmHg, p less than 0.05 for all values). Late tamponade was associated with a marked rise in central venous pressure (14 +/- 1 to 22 +/- 2 mmHg, p less than 0.05), with only a mild decrease in LVAS output (4.9 +/- 1 to 3.8 +/- 0.9 L/min) and stroke volume (49 +/- 8 to 36 +/- 3 ml), without a significant change in mean arterial pressure. Two of these five late episodes occurred in patients who were anticoagulated with heparin (PTT 52 and 100 sec), and in one other with warfarin (PT 27 sec, PTT 55 sec); two patients were not on any anticoagulants. Surgical drainage of pericardial effusions, and especially of clotted blood found frequently posterior to the left ventricle in the space created by the LVAS decompressed left ventricle, resulted in an immediate return of all hemodynamic measurements to normal in both early and late tamponade. 
5	Localization of DNA sequences to a region within Xp11.21 between incontinentia pigmenti (IP1) X-chromosomal translocation breakpoints. Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is an X-linked dominant disorder characterized by developmental anomalies of the tissues and organs derived from embryonic ectoderm and neuroectoderm. An IP locus, designated IP1, probably resides in Xp11.21, since five unrelated patients with nonfamilial IP have been identified who possess constitutional de novo reciprocal X;autosome translocations involving Xp11.21. We have used a series of somatic cell hybrids containing the rearranged chromosomes derived from three of the five IP1 patients, along with other hybrid cell lines, to map probes in the vicinity of the IP1 locus. Five anonymous DNA loci--DXS422, DXS14, DXS343, DXS429, and DXS370--have been mapped to a region within Xp11.21, between two IP1 X-chromosomal translocation breakpoints; the IP1 t(X;17) breakpoint is proximal (centromeric) to this region, and the IP1 t(X;13) and t(X;9) X-chromosomal breakpoints lie distal to it. While no IP1 translocation breakpoint has yet been identified by pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (PFGE) analysis, an overlap between three probes--p58-1, 7PSH3.5, and cpX210--has been detected, placing these probes within 125 kb. Four probes--p58-1, 7PSH3.5, cpX210, and 30CE2.8--have been helpful in constructing a 1,250-kb PFGE map of the region between the breakpoints; these results suggest that the IP1 X-chromosomal translocation breakpoints are separated by at least this distance. The combined somatic cell hybrid and PFGE analyses we report here favor the probe order DXS323-(IP1 t(X;13), IP1, t(X;9]-(DXS422, DXS14, DXS343, DXS429, DXS370)-(IP1 t(X;17), DXZ1). These sequences provide a starting point for identifying overlapping genomic sequences that span the IP1 translocation breakpoints; the availability of IP1 translocation breakpoints should now assist the cloning of this locus. 
2	The role of cholecystokinin in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis in the isolated pancreas preparation. In a variety of animal models of acute pancreatitis, cholecystokinin-receptor antagonists have ameliorated the injury response. These results suggest that cholecystokinin may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis initiated by multiple stimuli. In an effort to test this theory, a sensitive and high affinity cholecystokinin-receptor antagonist L364,718 was administered to four different models of acute pancreatitis that were produced in the ex vivo perfused canine pancreas preparation. The four models of pancreatitis were initiated by cerulein infusion, partial duct obstruction with secretin stimulation, oleic acid infusion, and a 2-hour period of ischemia. In each model, pancreatitis was manifest by edema formation, weight gain, and hyperamylasemia during a 4-hour perfusion. In cerulein infusion-induced pancreatitis L364,718 inhibited edema formation and weight gain (31 +/- 5 gm versus 7 +/- 6 gm; p less than 0.05) and significantly decreased plasma amylase activity (36,605 +/- 21,216 U/dl versus 9421 +/- 5149 U/dl; p less than 0.05). The acute pancreatitis induced by the other three stimuli was not ameliorated by L364,718 treatment. We conclude that in the ex vivo-perfused canine pancreas preparation cerulein-induced pancreatitis is mediated at least in part by the cholecystokinin receptor. Early blockade of the cholecystokinin receptor was of no benefit in treating the other models of pancreatitis, suggesting that cholecystokinin is not involved in the early pathogenesis. 
5	Outcomes of pregnancies among women and partners of men with a history of exposure to methoxsalen photochemotherapy (PUVA) for the treatment of psoriasis. Because oral methoxsalen and UV-A radiation (PUVA) therapy is mutagenic, concern exists about the potential for teratogenic effects resulting from the use of this therapy at the time of conception and during pregnancy. After 12.8 years of prospective study, we documented the pregnancy outcomes among 1380 patients (892 men and 488 women) who received PUVA treatments. Ninety-four men reported 167 pregnancies in their partners, and 93 women reported 159 pregnancies. For 34% of pregnancies among partners of male patients, the man received PUVA therapy near the time of conception. Nineteen percent of female patients reported exposure to PUVA at the time of conception or during pregnancy. Induced and spontaneous abortions were reported as the outcome of pregnancy more often by female than by male patients (12% vs 30%). Two congenital malformations and two stillbirths occurred, an incidence not significantly different from that expected for the general population. Although the power of our study to detect an increase in the risk of specific defects is limited, our data show no evidence to suggest that PUVA is a potent teratogen. Still, because PUVA is mutagenic, we believe it prudent for patients to avoid PUVA treatment during pregnancy whenever practical. 
1	Which clinical variables predict an abnormal double-contrast barium enema result? OBJECTIVE: To determine the relations among patient history, symptoms, objective indicators, and abnormal double-contrast barium enema results in outpatients. PATIENTS AND SETTING: Seven hundred and ninety-four patients receiving care in a large multispecialty medical group. DESIGN: Physicians completed a form before ordering a double-contrast barium enema, listing information about patient history, symptoms, and objective findings, including the results of a complete blood count, stool hemoccult, and sigmoidoscopy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Outcome measures were colon cancer and any abnormal finding. The results of 18.6% of the barium enemas were abnormal. The most frequent positive findings were of polyps (8.8%) and colon cancer (2.9%). Over 50% of the barium enemas were ordered solely on the basis of symptoms, yet there was no statistical correlation between symptoms and colon cancer or any positive finding. Using logistic regression, four variables were shown to be significant predictors of colon cancer (P less than 0.05): abnormal sigmoidoscopy, iron deficiency anemia, positive stool hemoccult results, and relevant history. The respective odds ratios of these variables were 3.76 (95% CI, 2.89 to 4.90); 2.86 (CI, 2.13 to 3.74); 1.87 (CI, 1.46 to 2.39); and 1.91 (CI, 1.44 to 2.52), respectively. In a patient without any of these indicators, the predicted probability of having colon cancer was only 0.7%. In a patient with at least two objective indicators, the probability of having colon cancer was greater than 15%. CONCLUSIONS: Symptoms without objective indicators or pertinent risk factors do not correlate with an abnormal double-contrast barium enema result. Objective indicators are useful predictors of an abnormal barium enema result, particularly when looking for colon cancer. 
5	Life-threatening complications during anaesthesia in a patient with a ventriculo-atrial shunt and pulmonary hypertension [published erratum appears in Anaesthesia 1991 Mar;46(3):241] A 6-year-old patient with hydrocephalus who underwent revision of a ventriculo-atrial shunt is described. Anaesthesia was complicated by the occurrence of systemic hypertension and arterial hypoxaemia. The patient was subsequently found to have pulmonary hypertension secondary to recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism. The pathophysiological mechanisms for the patient's deterioration are discussed and the anaesthetic management of children with pulmonary hypertension is outlined. It is concluded that patients with a ventriculo-atrial shunt who present for surgery should be screened carefully for the presence of pulmonary hypertension. 
3	Transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis after M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) chemotherapy. The M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) regimen has been utilized at our two institutions to treat 17 patients with advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. We report 2 cases of carcinomatous meningitis resulting from metastatic transitional cell carcinoma which occurred in patients treated with M-VAC. Review of the literature suggests that our experience with central nervous system metastases is not unique, and that treatment of advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with M-VAC may enhance the incidence of meningeal metastases. Carcinomatous meningitis, although rare, is a rapidly fatal manifestation of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma if left untreated. However, prompt diagnosis and early aggressive therapy may result in palliation and stabilization of neurologic status. We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis. 
4	Physiologic peripheral pulmonic stenosis in infancy. We studied 14 premature infants with the clinical diagnosis of peripheral pulmonic stenosis (PPS) and 15 normal full-term neonates by echocardiographic Doppler examinations. The PPS group had an average main pulmonary artery (PA) diameter similar to the control group (0.91 vs 0.96 cm, difference not significant), but had smaller branch PA diameters: right PA = 0.41 vs 0.50 cm, p less than 0.001, and left PA = 0.41 vs 0.49 cm, p less than 0.001. The PPS group also had greater peak velocities in the main PA (76 vs 63 cm/s, p less than 0.05), right PA (193 vs 118 cm/s, p less than 0.001) and left PA (187 vs 123 cm/s, p less than 0.001). Similarly, the ratio of peak velocity in the branch/main PA was greater for the PPS group: right/main PA peak velocity = 2.91 vs 1.92, p less than 0.01, and left/main PA peak velocity = 2.73 vs 1.99, p less than 0.05. The calculated right ventricular output for the PPS group was more than the control group: 437 vs 261 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001. Hematocrits were not done on the control group, but the PPS group had an average hematocrit which was low (34%). It is concluded that patients with PPS have mild underdevelopment of the PA branches, with consequent increased flow velocity and turbulent flow. This turbulent flow may be contributed to by increased cardiac output and mild anemia. 
5	Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas in a patient with hepatitis A. Hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas were found in a 30-year-old patient with serologically confirmed hepatitis A. Other causes associated with the presence of fibrin-ring granulomas in the liver, such as Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, cytomegalovirus infection, visceral leishmaniasis, and consumption of allopurinol, were ruled out. It is suggested that hepatitis A must be included in the differential diagnosis of a patient with hepatic fibrin-ring granulomas. 
5	Elevated plasma endothelin-1 concentrations are associated with the severity of illness in patients with sepsis. Plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1 concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay in 11 septic patients during the first 24 hours after the development of the sepsis syndrome in 15 nonseptic postoperative patients studied 24 hours after open heart surgery and in 14 healthy volunteers. Mean endothelin-1 plasma concentrations were significantly (p less than 0.001) increased in septic patients (19.9 +/- 2.2 pg/mL, mean +/- standard error) compared to concentrations found in postoperative cardiac patients (11.9 +/- 0.7 pg/mL) or in healthy volunteers (6.1 +/- 0.3 pg/mL). In septic patients elevated plasma concentrations of endothelin-1 were inversely correlated with cardiac index (r = -0.80, p less than 0.005) and positively correlated the severity of illness as documented by APACHE II score (r = 0.74, p less than 0.01) and plasma creatinine levels (r = 0.80, p less than 0.005). No such correlations were found in postoperative cardiac patients. These results indicate that endothelin-1 concentrations are correlated with the severity of illness and depression of cardiac output in patients with sepsis. 
1	Determinants of cell type in patients with cancer of the lungs. In order to evaluate the determinants of cell type in patients with primary lung cancer, we compared smoking characteristics in 1,939 patients (1,474 men and 465 women). Patients with squamous cell carcinomas, adenocarcinomas, or small-cell carcinomas were eligible. This study did not consider smoking as a risk factor for lung cancer, as all subjects had a confirmed diagnosis. We were interested in smoking history and the pattern of smoking among those whose risk was 100 percent. Among these patients, we confirmed that a larger subset of nonsmoking individuals developed adenocarcinomas than squamous cell or small-cell carcinomas; however, the duration and intensity of cigarette smoking, as measured by pack-years, were not determinants of tumor cell type in male patients. Small-cell carcinomas in women were more strongly associated with cigarette smoking than either squamous cell carcinomas or adenocarcinomas. More than 3,500 different substances have been measured in tobacco smoke, including tumor initiators, promoters, and those involved in tumor progression. These data confirm the hypothesis that factors other than cigarette smoking are more likely to be involved in the initiation of adenocarcinomas than other cell types. Endogenous and exogenous factors related to gender may be more important than the duration or intensity of cigarette smoking. 
5	Chylous drainage from a stab wound to the neck. A 24-year-old man was assaulted and sustained a stab wound to the left lower neck. When he arrived at the emergency department, he was hemodynamically stable. Although the wound had penetrated the platysma, on initial evaluation the patient did not appear to have sustained significant injury. Closer examination of the wound revealed chylous drainage, indicating injury to the cervical portion of the thoracic duct. The patient was taken to the operating room for exploration of the wound, during which an injury to the left internal jugular vein was identified and repaired. The thoracic duct, which had been severed, was ligated. The remainder of the patient's hospital course was unremarkable. The consistent association between penetrating injury to the cervical portion of the thoracic duct and injury to neighboring vascular structures is discussed. 
5	Pathogenetic role of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer disease. Multivariate analysis of factors affecting relapse. The pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer disease is multifactorial and the contribution of Helicobacter pylori in relation to the other factors to the release of duodenal ulcer is unknown. To investigate this, we studied 147 patients with endoscopically proven healed ulcers. These patients were randomized to receive either placebo, misoprostol 200 micrograms or misoprostol 300 micrograms four times daily, and clinical, personal, physiological and endoscopic characteristics were obtained prospectively. Endoscopy was performed at the active phase of the ulcer and when the ulcer healed. Biopsies were taken from the antrum to assess histologically for: (1) the activity of gastritis as assessed by the degree of polymorph infiltration, (2) the degree of chronic inflammation by the degree of chronic inflammatory cells infiltration and degree of mucosal degeneration, and (3) bacteriologically for the presence of H. pylori. The severity of the gastritis and the bacterial density were graded independently by two pathologists. The patients were assessed at two-month intervals for 12 months or until the ulcer relapsed. The results demonstrated that the relapse rates of duodenal ulcer were similar in the three treatment groups. The relapse rate was higher in the group with higher density of the bacteria (P less than 0.05). The degree of gastritis did not affect the relapse rate of duodenal ulcer in either the placebo or misoprostol group or in all patients combined. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified that increased duodenal inflammation, male sex, early-onset disease, and H. pylori adversely affected relapse of the ulcer. We conclude that multiple factors affect the relapse of duodenal ulcer and H. pylori is one of them. 
4	Doppler diagnostics, indications, and control of surgical treatment in patients with carotid pathology. Major stroke is a relatively common cause of death or disabling invalidism in patients with atherosclerosis. In a large percentage of cases it is caused by stenotic/thrombotic processes in carotid arteries and this emphasizes the importance of the problem of early diagnosis and treatment of carotid pathology. Recently Doppler sonography has become a leading non-invasive method of early screening of stenotic processes in carotid arteries. The aim of the present study was to ascertain the diagnostic abilities of Doppler sonography for screening of carotid pathology, assessment of extra-cranial and intracranial hemodynamics, defining of indications, and control of vascular reconstructions of carotids. 
1	Lymphoscintigraphy with 123I-labelled epidermal growth factor We have used 123I-labelled epidermal growth factor (EGF) scans to study 14 patients with advanced cervical cancer. Abnormal lymph node imaging was seen most clearly 6-8 h after the injection and revealed abnormal uptake by pelvic lymph nodes in 11 patients. 4 of these 11 had abnormal computerised tomographic and ultrasound scans; in the other 7 conventional radiology did not confirm the presence of disease. 
5	Effect of a short course of prednisone in the prevention of early relapse after the emergency room treatment of acute asthma. BACKGROUND. Relapse after the treatment of acute asthma in the emergency room is common (occurring in 25 to 30 percent of cases) and is not accurately predicted by any available measurements. We studied the usefulness of prednisone in reducing this high rate of relapse. METHODS. One hundred twenty-two patients treated in the emergency room for acute exacerbations of asthma were assigned in a randomized, double-blind fashion to receive at discharge either prednisone for eight days (the dose being tapered from 40 to 0 mg per day) or matching placebo. Ninety-three were subsequently discharged from the emergency room and participated in the trial. On days 1, 7, and 14 after discharge, the patients were assessed during home visits with spirometry and diary-card review; they were contacted by telephone on day 21. Relapse was defined as an unscheduled medical visit occasioned by the patient's perceived need for further asthma treatment. RESULTS. The overall risk of relapse was significantly lower in the prednisone group (P less than 0.05), with a significantly reduced rate of relapse during the first 10 days of follow-up (3 of 48, as compared with 11 of 45 in the placebo group; P less than 0.05). Thereafter (days 11 through 21), there was no further significant difference in relapse rates between treatment groups (five in the prednisone group and six in the placebo group). During the first week after discharge, patients receiving prednisone reported significantly lower mean (+/- SD) daily symptom scores for shortness of breath (1.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 2.5 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.01) and less frequent use of an inhaled bronchodilator (5.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 6.9 +/- 0.2 puffs per day, P less than 0.05) than patients receiving placebo. Subsequently, symptom scores and bronchodilator use were similar in the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. A short course of prednisone reduced early relapse rates after the treatment of acute asthma in the emergency room, an effect limited to the period of steroid administration. 
4	Effect of left ventricular aneurysm on risk of sudden and nonsudden cardiac death. Although left ventricular (LV) aneurysm is associated with increased mortality, its independent prognostic significance is controversial. To determine the effect of LV aneurysm on risk, 121 patients with healed myocardial infarction (MI), 55 manifesting akinesia on ventriculography (MI group) and 66 with LV aneurysm characterized by diastolic deformity (eccentricity) and systolic dyskinesia (LV aneurysm group) were studied. At a mean follow-up of 5.7 years, there were 32 cardiac deaths (12 MI vs 20 LV aneurysm), including 9 sudden deaths (1 MI vs 8 LV aneurysm). Multivariate analysis revealed decreasing ejection fraction to be the best predictor of total cardiac death, and revascularization to be protective. Nonsudden cardiac death was predicted by ejection fraction, absence of revascularization and right coronary artery disease, whereas sudden cardiac death was predicted by LV aneurysm and the frequency of ventricular ectopic complexes on Holter monitoring. In the MI group, ejection fraction was the only significant predictor of total cardiac death and nonsudden cardiac death. In the LV aneurysm group, total cardiac death, as well as nonsudden cardiac death, were predicted by ejection fraction, ventricular tachycardia and right coronary artery disease, whereas ventricular tachycardia predicted sudden cardiac death. It is concluded that the risk profile for total cardiac death differs between LV aneurysm and MI patients, and that LV aneurysm constitutes an independent predictor of late sudden cardiac death after MI. Moreover, on a substrate of LV aneurysm, the risk factors for sudden cardiac death and nonsudden cardiac death differ, with ventricular tachycardia being the sole predictor of sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, Holter monitoring is valuable in identifying patients at persistent risk of sudden cardiac death. 
1	Oncogene amplification in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Cellular oncogenes appear to be involved in the control of normal cell growth and differentiation. The abnormal activation of these genes in naturally occurring and experimentally induced cancers may have an important role in the expression of the malignant phenotype in cancer cells. Mechanisms for the activation of these genes include chromosomal translocation, point mutation, and DNA amplification. The amplification of specific oncogenes correlates with clinical prognosis in several human malignancies, including breast cancer and neuroblastoma. We examined 21 fresh-frozen human squamous cell carcinomas of the aerodigestive tract for amplification of 10 known cellular oncogenes (c-myc, N-myc, L-myc, N-ras, H-ras, K-ras, erb-B, erb-B2, raf, and int-2), using Southern blotting techniques. Eleven of 21 tumors demonstrated a two-fold to 11-fold amplification of the int-2 oncogene, one member of a family of genes related to basic fibroblast growth factor. Amplification of c-myc, a gene that codes for a DNA-binding protein involved in the regulation of cell growth, was seen in two tumors. None of the other eight genes studied were amplified in any of the tumor specimens. 
5	Enhanced utilization of exogenous glucose improves cardiac function in hypoxic rabbit ventricle without increasing total glycolytic flux. The effects of elevated glucose on cardiac function during hypoxia were investigated in isolated arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septa. Rest tension, developed tension, intracellular potential, 42K+ efflux, lactate production, exogenous glucose utilization, and tissue high-energy phosphate levels were measured during a 50-min period of hypoxia with 4, 5, or 50 mM glucose present (isosmotically balanced with sucrose) and during reoxygenation for 60 min with perfusate containing 5 mM glucose/45 mM sucrose. At physiologic (4 or 5 mM) and supraphysiologic glucose (50 mM), lactate production and high-energy phosphate levels during hypoxia were equally well maintained, yet cardiac dysfunction was markedly attenuated by 50 mM glucose. Despite identical rates of total glycolytic flux, exogenous glucose utilization was enhanced by 50 mM glucose so that tissue glycogen levels remained normal during hypoxia, whereas glycogen became depleted with 4 or 5 mM glucose present during hypoxia. Most of the beneficial effects of 50 mM glucose occurred during the first 25 min of hypoxia. Prior glycogen depletion had no deleterious effects during hypoxia with 50 mM glucose present, but exacerbated cardiac dysfunction during hypoxia with 5 mM glucose present. These findings indicate that enhanced utilization of exogenous glucose improved cardiac function during hypoxia without increasing total glycolytic flux or tissue high-energy phosphate levels, suggesting a novel cardioprotective mechanism. 
2	Enteroglucagon and peptide Y-Y response after construction of a pelvic reservoir in humans. The results of an investigation of plasma levels of gastrointestinal hormones in patients after the construction of a pelvic reservoir are reported. Enteroglucagon (EG) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY), two hormones believed to play a relevant role in the adaptive response to bowel resection, were investigated using a specific radioimmunoassay in basal conditions and after a standard meal. Pouch patients showed a statistically significant increase in basal levels of both enteroglucagon and PYY compared with control subjects (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.001, respectively). The response of enteroglucagon to food ingestion, evaluated by means of the total integrated response, was similar in patients and controls. Conversely, the response of PYY was significantly increased in pouch patients compared with control cases (P less than 0.02). Results of this investigation suggest that gut hormones may be involved in mediating the adaptive response of the intestine to pouch construction. Changes of gut peptides may explain, at least in part, the functional results observed after pouch construction. 
5	Gallbladder perforation and bile leakage: percutaneous treatment. Three patients with spontaneous gallbladder perforation and one with an iatrogenic bile leak causing bile peritonitis were treated successfully by means of percutaneous catheter drainage. Three patients had cholelithiasis as the cause of perforation; the fourth patient had previously undergone gallstone dissolution with methyl tert-butyl ether lavage and developed bile peritonitis a few hours after removal of the catheter. In three patients, a percutaneous cholecystostomy catheter provided successful decompression; in the fourth patient, drainage was performed with a percutaneous sump catheter in the subhepatic space adjacent to the gallbladder. No specific complications occurred. Follow-up was performed at 1, 12, 22, and 59 months, respectively. To date, one of the four patients has undergone elective cholecystectomy (1 month after drainage). The remainder of the patients are asymptomatic. This preliminary experience suggests that the severe complication of gallbladder perforation and bile leakage may be treated, at least temporarily, by means of percutaneous drainage. 
5	What is the best predictor of spontaneous ventricular tachycardia and sudden death after myocardial infarction? BACKGROUND. Death during the first year after myocardial infarction is most commonly due to spontaneous ventricular tachycardia (VT) or fibrillation (VF). The purpose of this study was to compare, in a single cohort of patients, the values of inducible VT, delayed ventricular activation, low left ventricular ejection fraction, high-grade ventricular ectopy, and ST segment displacement on exercise in predicting electrical events (witnessed instantaneous death and spontaneous VT or VF) during the first year after myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Three hundred sixty one patients aged less than 71 years underwent electrophysiological study, signal-averaged electrocardiogram, gated blood-pool scan, 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and exercise testing 1-2 weeks after myocardial infarction and were then followed up for at least 1 year. There were 34 deaths (eight witnessed instantaneous, 26 other), and nine patients survived one or more episodes of spontaneous VF or VT. Patients with inducible VT were 15.2 times more likely to suffer electrical events than patients without inducible VT. No proportional-hazards model excluding inducible VT was as good a predictor of electrical events as was inducible VT alone. CONCLUSIONS. Inducible VT at electrophysiological study was the single best predictor of spontaneous VT and sudden death after myocardial infarction. 
5	Upper gastrointestinal bleeding in dengue fever. Twenty-six virologically and serologically confirmed Dengue patients with signs of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding (13.1%) were studied during the 1987 outbreak in southern Taiwan. Within a 1-yr period from 1987 to 1988 in Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, there were 198 patients with Dengue fever confirmed. Viral isolation and serological studies indicated that type I Dengue was the cause. There was no evidence of sequential secondary infection among them. The 26 patients were evaluated gastroduodenoscopically. Most of the Dengue patients who developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding had gastric ulcers or duodenal ulcers; superficial and hemorrhagic gastritis are the other relevant endoscopic findings. Thirteen patients (50%) had a past history of peptic ulcer symptoms, whereas the other 13 did not. Dengue infection is a precipitating factor in inducing peptic ulcer bleeding because of hemostatic derangements. Supportive therapy and blood transfusions alone were adequate treatment, except for one patient who required surgery due to massive bleeding of a duodenal ulcer. No mortality was observed in this study. 
2	Intestinal perforation due to cytomegalovirus infection in patients with AIDS. Intestinal perforation due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in patients with AIDS is the most common life-threatening condition requiring emergency celiotomy in these patients. The authors describe a patient with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection, and review 14 additional cases reported in the English-language surgical literature. The diagnostic triad of pneumoperitoneum on x-ray, evidence or history of CMV infection, and AIDS occurred in 70 percent of patients. The most common site of intestinal perforation was the colon (53 percent), followed in frequency by the distal ileum (40 percent) and appendix (7 percent); perforation usually occurred between the distal ileum and splenic flexure of the colon. Colonoscopy, rather than sigmoidoscopy, is recommended as a screening examination in patients with AIDS suspected of having colonic ulceration due to CMV infection. Multiple biopsies of ulcerated tissue should be obtained. Gross and microscopic analyses of involved intestinal tissue reveal the characteristic findings of ulceration and CMV infection. Despite aggressive therapy, the operative mortality rate in patients with AIDS with intestinal perforation due to CMV infection was 54 percent and the overall mortality rate was 87 percent. Postoperative complications occurred in most patients and consisted mainly of systemic sepsis and pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis carinii infection. An increased awareness of this syndrome by physicians frequently called on to manage patients with AIDS is recommended. 
4	The pharmacology of aspirin, heparin, coumarin, and thrombolytic agents. Implications for therapeutic use in cardiopulmonary disease. The modern treatment of cardiopulmonary disease is increasingly predicated on the goal of dissolving the offending clot to establish vascular patency as rapidly as possible and then preventing rethrombosis. The availability of thrombolytic agents has made this therapeutic approach possible and the adjunctive use of heparin, coumarin, and aspirin has increased the efficacy of lytic drugs. The administration of any of these medications is associated with inherent risks, which are enhanced when they are used concomitantly. An understanding of coagulation and an appreciation of the pathophysiologic processes of the thrombotic events occurring in cardiopulmonary disease states are critical to the formulation of innovative therapeutic regimens that maximize efficacy and safety. Furthermore, knowledge of the comparative pharmacology of the various thrombolytic agents is useful in explaining the benefits and complications observed in clinical trials. 
4	Characteristics of biliary lipid metabolism after liver transplantation. Biliary lipid metabolism was studied after 10 liver transplantations with continuous drainage of bile. Within 3 wk after transplantation, the new liver produced bile with concentrations of biliary lipids in agreement with those reported for T-tube bile in cholecystectolized nontransplanted subjects. Although changes in biliary lipid composition occurred swiftly in response to various forms of disturbed liver function, they did not provide substantially more information than did standard serum tests or simple measurements of bile flow in most patients. Secretion rates of phospholipids and cholesterol were found to be completely bile acid dependent. For each micromole of bile acids, 0.22 and 0.08 mumol of phospholipids and cholesterol were secreted, respectively. When bile flow was related to bile acid output, a linear relationship was found (r = 0.89), with a positive intercept indicating a bile acid-independent bile flow of approximately 44 microliters/min. Analysis of individual bile acids showed almost exclusively primary bile acids. The relative proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid was more prominent during the first days after transplantation. Different explanations for this are discussed. 
5	Multilevel transneuronal degeneration after brain damage. Behavioral events and effects of anticonvulsant gamma-aminobutyric acid-related drugs. Recent morphologic and behavioral studies of the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid agents on transsynaptic degeneration after cortical and striatal damage are reviewed and discussed. Following unilateral lesions of the anteromedial cortex, mild atrophy appears in the ipsilateral striatum and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Long-term diazepam administration greatly enhances this degeneration, extends the degeneration into the thalamus, and severely disrupts recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Following unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the striatum, progressive degeneration of neurons occurs in the substantia nigra pars reticulata and efferent targets in the thalamus. This degeneration can be prevented by chronic infusion of muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist. Unexpectedly, this treatment did not facilitate recovery from somatosensory asymmetries. Recovery in muscimol-treated animals was impaired relative to saline-treated controls. Thus, gamma-aminobutyric acid agonists either may enhance or prevent neural atrophy secondary to brain damage, but the behavioral outcome appears to depend importantly on the excitatory and inhibitory characteristics of the affected networks. 
1	Pseudotumor of the craniocervical junction during long-term hemodialysis. A systematic study of the upper cervical spine was performed using magnetic resonance imaging in 25 patients (15 men and 10 women) who had been undergoing hemodialysis for more than 10 years. Seven pseudotumors of the periodontoid soft tissue were disclosed, which were similar to the pannus recently described in rheumatoid arthritis. Bone cystic radiolucencies were observed in association with these pseudotumors in 5 patients. The radiolucencies were located in the atlas (1 in the lateral mass and 1 in the anterior branch) and in the axis (3 in the odontoid process and 1 in the vertebral body). No horizontal or vertical atlantoaxial subluxation was demonstrated. These features were observed only in patients who had amyloid arthropathy. They could be a frequent, yet thus far little-recognized, feature of beta 2-microglobulin amyloidosis. 
2	Inflammatory bowel disease induced by combined bacterial immunization and oral carrageenan in guinea pigs. Model development, histopathology, and effects of sulfasalazine. A model of experimentally induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) featuring colitis, originally devised by Onderdonk and co-workers in guinea pigs, was modified to establish the optimal conditions for ulcer development. Upon varying the time of subcutaneous immunization with Bacteroides vulgatus and concomitant oral administration of acid-degraded iota-carrageenan and viable B. vulgatus, it was found that the optimal times of administering these agents were one to two weeks and five to six days, respectively. Light microscopy of the colon and cecum of the guinea pigs given the optimized treatment for ulcer induction revealed pronounced edema, inflammation, and lesions of the mucosa. Transmission electron microscopy of the mucosa from these animals showed the presence of large numbers of leukocytes in the subepithelial region, the majority being polymorphonuclear neutrophils which possessed large electron-dense granules or rods. Oral administration of 300 mg/kg/day sulfasalazine (salicylazosulfapyridine) for 14 days to guinea pigs given the optimized treatment for ulcer induction failed to reduce the numbers of ulcers or the histopathology gradings and fine structural changes of the mucosal inflammatory changes, but did reduce the symptoms of diarrhea. 
1	Metabolism of human gliomas: assessment with H-1 MR spectroscopy and F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET Localized hydrogen-1 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) were employed to obtain metabolic information from intracranial gliomas. Advantages and difficulties associated with comparison of results from the two modalities were realized. Forty patients were studied with H-1 MR spectroscopy. MR signal intensities from lactate, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline, and creatine from a volume of interest containing the tumor and a contralateral volume were obtained and evaluated. NAA signal intensities were generally decreased in the tumor spectra, and choline signal intensities were elevated. H-1 MR spectroscopy was unsuccessful in eight patients, and FDG PET scans were not obtained in four of the patients with successful MR spectroscopic examinations. Lactate signal intensity was detected in 10 of the 28 patients who had successful H-1 MR spectroscopic and FDG PET studies. Lactate signal intensities were observed in lesions shown at FDG PET to be hypermetabolic, as well as in lesions found to be hypometabolic. 
5	Plasma concentrations of bupivacaine and two of its metabolites during continuous interscalene brachial plexus block. An interscalene brachial plexus block was performed via a catheter with 20-28 ml of 0.75% bupivacaine plus adrenaline for surgery of the shoulder region in 12 patients. Constant infusion of 0.25% bupivacaine 0.25 mg kg-1 h-1 was continued for 24 h. During surgery light general anaesthesia, without analgesics, was maintained. Plasma concentrations of total and unbound (free fraction) bupivacaine, desbutylbupivacaine (DBB), 4-hydroxybupivacaine (4-OHB) and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (AAG) were measured at predetermined intervals during the continuous block. The greatest mean plasma concentrations of bupivacaine were measured at 30 min (1.63 (SD 0.55) micrograms ml-1) and 60 min (1.38 (0.48) micrograms ml-1). There was a small but statistically significant increase in the plasma concentration of bupivacaine between 12 and 24 h of infusion. The mean unbound concentration of bupivacaine in plasma decreased from 0.044 (0.015) microgram ml-1 (3.6 (1.1)% of total bupivacaine concentration) at 3 h to 0.023 (0.011) micrograms ml-1 (2.1 (1.0)%) at 24 h. The AAG concentration in plasma increased by 38% in 24 h. The metabolites DBB and 4-OHB were detectable in plasma from 30 min, with a gradual increase during infusion. At 24 h the mean concentrations of DBB and 4-OHB were 0.33 (0.22) micrograms ml-1 and 0.13 (0.04) micrograms ml-1, respectively. There were no toxic reactions during the blocks. 
4	Fasting in vivo delays myocardial cell damage after brief periods of ischemia in the isolated working rat heart. To assess the effects of fasting on recovery of function and exogenous glucose metabolism after 15 minutes of total ischemia, we perfused isolated working rat hearts from fed and fasted animals. Hearts were perfused in a recirculating system with bicarbonate buffer containing glucose (10 mM). Mechanical performance, release of marker proteins for ischemic membrane damage (lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin, citrate synthase), and the concentrations of lactate and glucose in the perfusion medium were measured serially. Tissue metabolites were also measured. Fasting raised the myocardial glycogen content by 25%. Cardiac performance of perfused hearts from fed and fasted animals was the same during the preischemic and the post-ischemic period. The time of return of function to preischemic values was significantly less in hearts from fasted rats (2.3 versus 7.8 minutes, p less than 0.025). The release of cytosolic and mitochondrial marker proteins was significantly lower in hearts from fasted rats than in hearts from fed rats. Glucose metabolic rates during control and reperfusion were unchanged for hearts from fasted rats, but decreased for hearts from fed rats during reperfusion. The adenine nucleotide content at the end of ischemia was higher in hearts from fasted animals than in hearts from fed animals. We conclude that increasing glycogen levels prior to ischemia improves recovery of function, lessens membrane damage, and prevents loss of adenine nucleotides. 
1	Capsular transgression of prostatic carcinoma: evaluation with transrectal US with pathologic correlation. One hundred twenty-five patients with biopsy proved clinical stage A or B prostatic carcinoma were evaluated with biplane transrectal ultrasonography (US) prior to radical prostatectomy. Sonograms were evaluated for capsular transgression of the tumor into the posterior and posterolateral aspects of the glands as manifested by local contour deformity and irregularity or interruption of the periprostatic fat echoes. Correlation of the findings at US with the findings at pathologic examination of the step sections was obtained, and the presence and depth of capsular penetration were assessed. Of the 250 halves or hemispheres of the prostate gland that were evaluated, capsular penetration was seen at pathologic examination in 86. US enabled correct identification of pericapsular tumor spread in 59 of the 86 hemispheres but did not depict pericapsular tumor spread in 27 hemispheres. Absence of pericapsular tumor spread was verified at pathologic examination in 149 of the 164 hemispheres that either did not have tumor or did not show pericapsular tumor spread. Pericapsular tumor spread was incorrectly diagnosed in 15 hemispheres. A positive US diagnosis of pericapsular tumor spread correlated moderately well with the depth of penetration demonstrated at pathologic examination. Transrectal US is an effective noninvasive procedure that demonstrates the presence of prostatic cancer. 
4	Therapy of ischemic cardiomyopathy with pentoxifylline. Abnormal blood rheology is a known characteristics of coronary artery disease. The authors evaluated the effects of pentoxifylline on the exercise capacity ejection fraction and symptoms of 9 patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. All patients had signs and symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction. All had at least two major vessels obstructed as determined by coronary angiography. Pentoxifylline 400 mg three times daily was administered for twelve weeks. Seven of 9 patients responded with increases in ejection fraction and exercise tolerance. Exercise tolerance correlated with improvement or lack of improvement in ejection fraction. For all patients at twelve weeks post-therapy mean ejection fraction increased 9.8% over baseline (p = .07), total treadmill time increased 15% (p = .27), and mean double product increased 13% (p = .03). Anginal symptoms were significantly improved over baseline at twelve weeks of therapy (p greater than .001), as well as dyspnea on exertion (p = .03). Pentoxifylline was well tolerated. Pentoxifylline may benefit ischemic cardiomyopathy by improving coronary perfusion owing to favorable alterations in hemorheologic properties. 
3	Ischaemic brain lesions diagnosed at birth in preterm infants: clinical events and developmental outcome. In 232 newborn babies of less than 32 weeks' gestational age ultrasound brain scans were carried out shortly after birth, daily for the first week of life, and at least twice weekly thereafter. Periventricular echogenicity associated with or progressing to periventricular leukomalacia (ischaemic brain lesions) was present in nine babies within two hours of birth (early onset); 30 other babies subsequently developed similar lesions (late onset). Babies with early onset lesions were more likely to have a history of intrauterine growth retardation and to have recurrent apnoea in the first few hours after birth. By contrast, late onset lesions were associated with hyaline membrane disease. In later childhood four of six survivors with early onset periventricular leukomalacia, and seven of 14 survivors with late onset periventricular leukomalacia, had various disabilities including spastic diplegia, impaired vision, squints, sensorineural hearing loss, and developmental delay. In a third of the children with disabilities ischaemic brain lesions were noted within two hours of birth, raising the possibility that some of this damage had taken place before or during birth. 
2	Esophageal reflux before and after isolated myotomy for achalasia. Four patients with achalasia underwent 24-hour esophageal pH measurements as ambulatory patients before and after limited myotomy without fundoplication. Resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure was reduced from 24.3 +/- 1.3 mm Hg to 7.5 +/- 4.3 mm Hg. No significant differences (p greater than 0.05) were found before and after operation in the total 24-hour pH data distribution (pH 6.24 +/- 0.84 vs 5.75 +/- 1.03), the fraction of time below pH 4.0 (4.8% +/- 5.3% vs 8.0% +/- 6.9%), or the mean duration of reflux episodes greater than 5 minutes (22.8 +/- 18.8 minutes vs 23.0 +/- 10 minutes), all +/- SD. Effective relief of esophageal obstruction in achalasia is feasible by isolated limited myotomy without producing gastroesophageal reflux. 
3	A protocol for butalbital, aspirin and caffeine (BAC) detoxification in headache patients. The abuse of the combination drug containing butalbital 50 mg, aspirin 325 mg and caffeine 40 mg (or BAC), is commonly recognized by headache specialists as causing headaches. Despite this widespread problem, there is not a published treatment regimen for the BAC detoxification of patients. I describe such a protocol which was used four times in three patients. These patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of the IHS Headache Classification for headaches induced by chronic substance abuse (8.2) and analgesics abuse headache (8.2.2). These patients took between 150 and 420 BAC/month for 2-15 years. Two patients had previously undergone inpatient detoxification. One patient unsuccessfully tried detoxification twice as an outpatient. All patients were required to have psychological support prior to hospitalization for this protocol. BAC was discontinued. A pentobarbital challenge test corroborated butalbital dosage. The patients were given phenobarbital and caffeine which were tapered over several days. Dihydroergotamine (DHE) with metoclopramide was used (Raskin). Propranolol 60 mg bid was started. No narcotics were permitted. After hospital discharge, patients were allowed to continue subcutaneous DHE, as needed. One patient restarted BAC use after 8 months without it. The other two patients were still BAC free 18 and 14 months after detoxification. 
5	Preoperative pulmonary status and postoperative extubation outcome of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to determine whether factors associated with impaired pulmonary function were predictive of postoperative extubation outcome (extubation according to protocol or delayed extubation) in a sample of patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Forty-seven patients were assessed before surgery and after postoperative extubation using a noninvasive assessment technique. Positive preoperative affect was the sole factor associated with extubation outcome in this sample of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Those who were extubated according to hospital protocol had significantly higher positive affect scores (p = 0.02) than did those who were not. Subjects with delayed extubations had a greater incidence of postoperative atelectasis (p = 0.02). They also had significantly longer stays in the surgical intensive care unit (p = 0.01) and the hospital (p = 0.05). Preoperative pulmonary function, age, sex, and history of smoking were not associated with postoperative extubation outcome. 
1	Utility of frozen-section evaluation of lymph nodes in the staging of bronchogenic carcinoma at mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy. We conducted a retrospective analysis of the utility of frozen-section diagnoses in determining lymph node status at mediastinoscopy in 122 consecutive patients with bronchogenic carcinoma. Thirty-five of 122 patients had one or more lymph nodes with frozen-section evaluation positive for metastatic carcinoma. Subsequent nodal sections not in the original frozen-section study revealed metastatic carcinoma in two additional patients. The false-negative rate was 1.6%. Sensitivity was 94.6%. Predictive value of negative frozen-section evaluation results was 97.7%. Because there were no false-positive frozen-section results, specificity and predictive value for positive results of frozen-section evaluation were 100%. The statuses of individual lymph nodes from these 122 patients were also evaluated. Six hundred twenty lymph nodes were sampled from the mediastinum at mediastinoscopy. Frozen-sections in 47 lymph nodes were positive. Subsequent nodal sections not in the original frozen-sections examination revealed metastatic carcinoma in four additional lymph nodes. The false-negative rate was 0.6%. Sensitivity was 92.2%. Predictive value of negative results from frozen-section evaluation was 99.3%. Because there were no false-positive frozen-section results, specificity and predictive value for positive results of frozen-section examination were 100%. We conclude that frozen-section evaluation of lymph nodes at mediastinoscopy reliably indicates lymph node status, thus enabling the physician to decide whether to proceed to thoracotomy. Thus staging of the carcinoma and definitive surgery can be accomplished during a single anesthetic procedure. Combining mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy with frozen-section diagnostic control also reduces both the length and cost of hospitalization. 
1	Superficial esophageal carcinoma. Surgical treatment and the results. We report 92 patients treated with esophagectomy for superficial esophageal carcinoma (SEC; 9.1% of all resected esophageal cancers at our institution). The operative mortality rate was 5.4%. In 24 cases, cancer invasion was limited to the mucosa, and in 68 to the submucosa. Twenty-three patients in the former group had no lymph node involvement, whereas 24 patients (35.3%) of the latter group had lymph node metastases. The 5-year survival rate after surgery for patients with SEC limited to the mucosa was 83.5%, which was significantly better than that for carcinoma invading the submucosa (54.9%). No recurrent disease occurred in patients with lesions limited to the mucosa. In conclusion, an esophagectomy with wide lymphadenectomy is necessary to provide a better prognosis for SEC invading the submucosa, whereas a less extensive treatment may be considered for SEC limited to the mucosa. 
5	Mutational activation of the c-Ha-ras gene in liver tumors of different rodent strains: correlation with susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis. The frequency and pattern of mutations at codon 61 of the c-Ha-ras gene have been analyzed in 195 liver tumors and 132 precancerous liver lesions from various rodent strains with differing susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis. By using the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, C----A transversions at the first base and A----T transversions or A----G transitions at the second base of c-Ha-ras codon 61 were detected in 20-60% of spontaneous or carcinogen-induced liver tumors of the C3H/He, CBA, CF1, and B6C3F1 mouse strains, which are highly susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis. No such mutations, however, could be found in any of the 31 liver tumors of the insensitive C57BL/6J and BALB/c mouse strains or in any of the 35 liver tumors of the comparatively resistant Wistar rat. Further analyses of c-Ha-ras codon 12 mutations in liver tumors from the three insensitive rodent strains also failed to give any positive results. In early precancerous liver lesions, c-Ha-ras codon 61 mutations were found in 13-14% of lesions of the sensitive C3H/He and B6C3F1 mouse strains but not in any of the 34 lesions of the insensitive C57BL/6J mouse. Taken together, our results indicate a close correlation between the mutational activation of the c-Ha-ras gene in liver tumors of the different rodent strains and their susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis, whereby the mutations appear to provide a selective growth advantage, leading to a clonal expansion of the mutated liver cell population, only in livers of sensitive but not of insensitive strains. 
4	Renal secretion and hepatic clearance of human multiple renin forms. Human active renin can be separated into at least five forms by isoelectric focusing. The present study assessed the preferential renal secretion and hepatic degradation of renin forms in humans. The renin form profile of secreted renal renin was determined before transplant in an ex vivo kidney donor perfusion system and compared with the peripheral plasma multiple renin form profile of normal subjects. The effect of hepatic degradation on renin forms was assessed in hepatic vein plasma in comparison with infrarenal vena cava plasma in hypertensive patients during renal vein renin studies. The results revealed a significantly greater proportion of the more basic forms in the perfusate of donor kidneys compared with normal plasma. In hypertensive patients the proportion of the more basic renin forms in the hepatic vein was significantly decreased in comparison with the infrarenal vena cava. Thus, the human kidney may preferentially secrete the more basic renin forms. In contrast, the liver preferentially degrades the more basic forms, giving these forms a shorter plasma half-life. The preferential secretion and clearance of the more basic forms of renin may contribute to short-term control of human renin-angiotensin system activity. 
2	Airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. We examined whether patients with irritable bowel syndrome have increased airway responsiveness by measuring forced expiratory volumes in 1 second (FEV1) after inhalation of increasing concentrations of methacholine. Responses obtained in 11 IBS patients were compared with those obtained in 11 normal subjects and in 11 subjects with organic disease of the gut or its related organs. All subjects were selected so that other factors that might contribute to increased airway responsiveness were excluded. The methacholine concentration that caused a 20% fall in the FEV1 (PC20), as well as the reduction in FEV1 induced by each methacholine concentration, were used to assess airway responsiveness. The geometric mean PC20 was 197.6 mg/mL (%SEM, 1.15) for normal subjects, 83.9 mg/mL (%SEM, 1.51) for subjects with organic bowel disease (P = 0.012), and only 12.8 mg/mL (%SEM, 1.74) for IBS patients (P less than 0.0001). The 22.5% +/- 2.5% decrease in FEV1 induced by 64 mg/mL of methacholine in IBS patients was significantly greater than that of 12.3% +/- 1.5% observed in healthy subjects (P = 0.003). In contrast, the 15.7% +/- 2.0% decrease in FEV1 observed in patients with organic disease was not different from that seen in normal subjects (P = 0.189). We conclude that IBS is associated with increased airway responsiveness following challenge with methacholine. 
5	Enhanced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ induced by halothane in hepatocytes isolated from swine susceptible to malignant hyperthermia. Halothane, in a dose-dependent manner, induced the release of intracellular Ca2+ in hepatocytes prepared from swine. The magnitude of the release induced by halothane was greater for hepatocytes prepared from animals susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MH) than for those from normal swine. Two different methods were used to ascertain the release of Ca2+ induced by halothane: 1) the release of 45Ca2+ from nonmitochondrial stores of saponin-permeabilized hepatocytes was measured; and 2) changes in luminescence from intact hepatocytes loaded with the Ca2(+)-sensitive photoprotein aequorin were recorded. It was also observed that, although 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP3), guanosine-5-triphosphate, and arachidonic acid all induced a significant release of 45Ca2+ from permeabilized swine hepatocytes, only the quantities of 45Ca2+ released by IP3 were significantly greater for the hepatocytes prepared from the animals susceptible to MH. These data indicate an abnormal Ca2+ homeostasis in hepatocytes isolated from swine susceptible to MH, which supports the hypothesis that membrane systems from multiple organs may be affected in this genetic disorder. 
5	Techniques of emergency ventilation: a model to evaluate tidal volume, airway pressure, and gastric insufflation. We designed a model to evaluate the effectiveness of various noninvasive methods of ventilation. The upper airway was simulated with the head of a Resusci-Annie which was attached to a test lung. The esophagus and stomach were simulated with a Penrose drain connected to a rolling seal spirometer via a PEEP valve. Fifteen paramedic volunteers ventilated the model utilizing mouth-to-mouth, mouth-to-mask, bag-valve-mask, or portable field ventilator (Impact or HARV). Recording of tidal volume, gastric volume, and proximal and distal airway pressure was completed at three different levels of compliance. At normal compliance, all methods except the HARV met or exceeded American Heart Association standards. As compliance decreased, tidal volume fell and gastric insufflation increased. At a compliance of 0.02 L/cm H2O all methods failed to meet AHA standards and gastric insufflation volume equalled delivered tidal volumes for mouth-to-mouth and mouth-to-mask techniques. Mouth-to-mouth and mouth-to-mask techniques generated the largest tidal volumes but also created the largest volume of gastric insufflation. The Impact ventilator provided an acceptable tidal volume with minimal gastric insufflation. Our results suggest that mouth-to-mask ventilation with supplemental oxygen enrichment is the most efficient technique for non-invasive airway management. 
5	New treatment for frontal sinus hypertrophy A new treatment of frontal sinus hypertrophy is described. The anterior wall is removed, inverted, and attached again. The resulting depression is filled with bone dust. Details are discussed, and a case is presented. 
5	Risk factors for emphysema. Cigarette smoking is associated with a reduction in the association rate constant of lung alpha 1-antitrypsin for neutrophil elastase. The increased risk of developing emphysema among individuals who smoke cigarettes and who have normal levels of alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) is hypothesized to result from a decrease in the antineutrophil elastase capacity of the lower respiratory tract alpha 1AT of smokers compared with nonsmokers. To evaluate this hypothesis we compared the time-dependent kinetics of the inhibition of neutrophil elastase by lung alpha 1AT from healthy, young cigarette smokers (n = 8) and nonsmokers (n = 12). alpha 1-antitrypsin was purified from lavage fluid using affinity and molecular sieve chromatography, and the association rate constant (k assoc) for neutrophil elastase quantified. The k assoc of smoker plasma alpha 1AT (9.5 +/- 0.5 X 10(6) M-1s-1) was similar to that of nonsmoker plasma (9.3 +/- 0.7 X 10(6) M-1s-1, P greater than 0.5). In marked contrast, the k assoc of smoker lower respiratory tract alpha 1AT was significantly lower than that of nonsmoker alpha 1AT (6.5 +/- 0.4 X 10(6) M-1s-1 vs. 8.1 +/- 0.5 X 10(6) M-1s-1, P less than 0.01). Furthermore, the smoker lower respiratory tract alpha 1AT k assoc was significantly less than that of autologous plasma (P less than 0.01). When considered in the context of the concentration of alpha 1AT in the lower respiratory tract epithelial lining fluid, the inhibition time for neutrophil elastase of smoker lung alpha 1AT was twofold greater than that of nonsmoker lung alpha 1AT (smoker: 0.34 +/- 0.05 s vs. nonsmoker: 0.17 +/- 0.05 s, P less than 0.01). Consequently, for concentrations of alpha 1AT in the lower respiratory tract it takes twice as long for an equivalent amount of neutrophil elastase to be inhibited in the smoker's lung compared with the nonsmoker's lung. These observations support the concept that cigarette smoking is associated with a decrease in the lower respiratory tract neutrophil elastase inhibitory capacity, thus increasing the vulnerability of the lung to elastolytic destruction and thereby increasing the risk for the development of emphysema. 
5	A family study of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome. Previous studies have demonstrated that Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS) is a familial disorder and that chronic tics (CT) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) appear to be etiologically related to the syndrome. In the present study we report the results from a study of 338 biological relatives of 86 TS probands, 21 biologically unrelated relatives of adopted TS probands, and 22 relatives of normal subjects. The 43 first-degree relatives of the adopted TS and normal probands constituted a control sample. The rates of TS, CT, and OCD in the total sample of biological relatives of TS probands were significantly greater than in the relatives of controls. In addition, the morbid risks of TS, OCD, and CT were not significantly different in families of probands with OCD when compared to relatives of probands without OCD. These findings provide further evidence that OCD is etiologically related to TS. 
1	Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the conjunctiva. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the conjunctiva is an extremely rare tumour, and only three previous cases have been reported. We describe two patients with MFH of the conjunctiva: a 58-year-old white male with epibulbar tumour who had exenteration and is alive after five years' follow-up, and a 3 1/2-year-old African girl with xeroderma pigmentosum and an MFH of her right eye conjunctiva, the first reported case of this association. The characteristics and the methods of diagnosis of MFH are discussed. 
1	Treatment of adenocarcinoma of the cardia with synchronous chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Twenty-nine evaluable patients with adenocarcinoma of the cardia were treated with synchronously administered chemotherapy (two cycles of 5-fluouracil and cisplatin and 30-36 Gy of radiation to determine whether these tumours are responsive to such treatment. Complete regression of tumour was observed endoscopically in 19 patients, and partial regression in four. Fourteen patients had their tumours resected and in six no microscopic tumour was found in the specimen. Nine patients received additional radiotherapy to a total dose of 54-60 Gy instead of surgery. Tumour response was associated with rapid reversal of dysphagia. Only one patient required subsequent intervention for relief of dysphagia due to fibrous stricture. Enhanced survival was associated with a complete endoscopic response to initial chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and a tumour of less than 5 cm in length. The median survival of responding patients was 15 months. Synchronous chemotherapy and radiotherapy was of major palliative benefit in this series and merits further evaluation. 
5	Outbreak of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-associated lymphadenitis and abscesses in Jamaican children. An outbreak of axillary lymphadenitis and abscesses after Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination (Pasteur Paris, Batch N5122) occurred in 139 Jamaican children between January and July, 1988. The overall rate of this complication was 0.95%. The attack rate was 1.92% among the 0- to 6-week age group and 0.6% in the 7- to 52-week age group. Of 139 patients there were 77 males and 62 females and the mean age at presentation was 4 months. The mean size of the BCG scar, duration of healing and Mantoux reaction size differed significantly in patients compared with those of control infants (P less than 0.01). Mycobacterium bovis was isolated from 11 patients. Immunologically index patients and controls differed significantly only with respect to T lymphocyte subpopulation percentages and concanavalin A stimulation indices. Evaluation of the BCG vaccine did not reveal either increased potency or microbial contamination. We conclude that increased susceptibility to the Pasteur strain of BCG might have contributed to the increased incidence of complications in these Jamaican children and hence caution should be exercised in switching one vaccine for another as is often done in the developing countries. 
4	Hypoplastic transverse arch and coarctation in neonates. Surgical reconstruction of the aortic arch: a study of sixty-six patients. From Jan. 1, 1983, to Jan. 1, 1988, 66 consecutive neonates with coarctation and severe hypoplasia of the transverse arch underwent coarctation repair by resection of the coarctation and reconstruction of the aortic arch. Mean age at operation was 14 +/- 8 days, ranging from 2 to 30 days; 63% of the newborn infants were less than 2 weeks of age. The coarctation was isolated in 23%, associated with a ventricular septal defect in 39%, and associated with complex anomalies in 38%, including 16 cases of transposition of the great arteries or doublet-outlet right ventricle plus ventricular septal defect, two cases of simple transposition, two of corrected transposition plus ventricular septal defect, and five cases of "hypoplastic" left ventricle. The surgical technique comprises a wide resection of the coarctation extended to the contiguous ductal tissue followed by the reconstruction of the aortic arch in bringing the descending aorta into the concavity of the aortic arch. This technique is able to relieve the obstruction of the aortic arch provided that (1) the descending aorta is widely dissected to allow mobilization and (2) the incision of the transverse arch is extended proximal to the ostium of the left carotid artery. The operation was performed through a left thoracotomy in 62 patients and through a sternotomy in four additional neonates with transposition and ventricular septal defect who underwent a one-stage repair with aortic reconstruction, closure of the defect, and arterial switch. The overall early mortality rate (less than 30 days) was 14% (9/66; 95% confidence limits = 5% to 22%), including four deaths occurring within the first month, at a concomitant or subsequent repair of the associated anomaly. There were six late deaths, all related to the associated lesions. The overall mortality rate was 23% (15/66; 95% confidence limits = 13% to 33%). The mean follow-up was 21 +/- 10 months, ranging from 6 to 66 months. Actuarial survival rates at 5 years are 72% +/- 10% for the overall group; 87% +/- 17% for simple coarctation; 88% +/- 12% for coarctation and ventricular septal defect; and 52% +/- 18% for complex coarctation. The rate of recurrent coarctation was 12.5% (95% confidence limits = 2% to 23%), leading to five reoperations with no deaths. Freedom from reoperation was 89.5% +/- 9% at 5 years. This technique of coarctation repair offers several advantages: low operative mortality, complete relief of the left ventricular obstruction, wide resection of the ductus tissue, absence of prosthetic material, and preservation of the left subclavian artery. 
4	Acute angiographic and clinical outcome of high speed percutaneous rotational atherectomy (Rotablator). Percutaneous rotational atherectomy (Rotablator), a high speed (greater than 100,000 RPM) rotational burr, was used successfully in 38 of 43 patients (88%) (mean age: 65 +/- 7 years) with 82 lesions (71 stenoses and 11 occlusions). The clinical indications were claudication (84%), nonhealing ulcer (7%), and renovascular hypertension (7%). Rotablation was successful in 78 of 82 lesions (95%): 68 of 71 (96%) stenoses (12 of 12 iliac, 11 of 11 femoral, 7 of 8 popliteal, 36 of 37 tibial, and 2 of 3 renal arteries; 60% of lesions were diffuse, i.e., greater than or equal to 4 cm in length), and 10 of 11 (91%) occlusions (5 of 6 femoral, 1 of 1 popliteal, 3 of 3 tibioperoneal, 1 of 1 brachial artery). The Rotablator significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced the arterial obstruction (stenoses: 85 +/- 11% to 12 +/- 12%); occlusions: 100% to 25 +/- 10%). The effective final burr size for arteries varied at 3.5-4.5 mm for renal, 3.0-3.5 mm for femoral, and 2.0-3.0 mm for brachial and tibial. Complications included gross hemoglobinuria without sequelae in 27 patients (63%), groin hematoma in 10 (23%), arterial spasm in 10 (23%), and arterial bypass in 2 (5%). The Rotablator was successfully used, without concomitant conventional balloon angioplasty, to open arterial lesions with excellent angiographic results in both diffuse and segmental peripheral vascular disease. There was gratifying patient clinical improvement. 
5	Predictors of quitting smoking: the NHANES I followup experience. There are no published prospective studies on the predictors of spontaneously quitting cigarette smoking in a nationally-representative U.S. population. This paper describes such a study, using a cohort taken from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I, 1971-1975) and traced by the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Survey (1982-1984). "Successful" quitting (for at least 1 year at time of followup) was ascertained among 4779 adults (age 25-74 years) who were smokers at the time of NHANES I and not disabled at followup. Independent predictors of quitting (by proportional hazards multiple regression) were: (1) older age; (2) White race; (3) fewer cigarettes smoked/day; (4) higher household income; and (5) hospitalization in the followup period. Predictors of relapse (ex-smokers at NHANES I who were smoking again at time of followup) were: (1) younger age; (2) urban residence; and (3) female gender. These findings have implications for intervention strategies, public health projections and further research. 
5	Patient flow in the emergency department: the chest pain patient. Prompt treatment of the chest pain patient in the emergency department (ED) is crucial. To ensure prompt treatment, identification of factors that delay flow of these patients through the department is essential. To identify factors that delay patient flow through the ED, the authors conducted a prospective study of all chest pain patients, using a time-flow analysis. Eighty-eight (36%) of 245 patients required critical unit admissions and had an average department stay of 3 1/2 hours. Flow differences were seen between critical and noncritical care patients. Three primary sources of delay were identified: critical unit bed availability, the registration process, and the role of the unit admitting resident. Additional findings confirmed the efficacy and role of the triage nurse in patient flow. Nursing and medical education and staffing needs were addressed. The use of the community's emergency medical services was examined by analyzing the disposition of patients arriving at the ED by ambulance. 
1	The effects of midazolam on cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption. Interaction with nitrous oxide in patients undergoing craniotomy for supratentorial cerebral tumours. Cerebral blood flow and the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen were measured in 30 patients during craniotomy for supratentorial cerebral tumours by a modification of the Kety-Schmidt technique using Xenon 133 intravenously. Anaesthesia was induced with midazolam 0.3 mg/kg, fentanyl and pancuronium, and maintained with midazolam as a continuous infusion, fentanyl, pancuronium and nitrous oxide in oxygen or oxygen in air. The concentration of midazolam in the blood of 10 patients was about 300 ng/litre during two measurements; the patients' lungs were ventilated with N2O in oxygen. The concentration of midazolam in the blood of another 10 patients was doubled to about 600 ng/litre during the second flow measurement; the patients' lungs were ventilated with N2O/O2. The concentration of midazolam in the blood of the third group of 10 patients was doubled to 600 ng/litre during the second flow measurement; the patients' lungs were ventilated with oxygen in air. No relationship was found between the dose of midazolam and cerebral blood flow or oxygen consumption. Nitrous oxide in combination with midazolam also had no effect on these variables. 
5	The effect of omental pedicle graft transfer on spinal microcirculation and laminectomy membrane formation. The properties of the omentum and its effect on spinal neurologic disease was investigated. Omental pedicle grafts were transferred to the laminectomized lumbar spines of nine neurologically normal dogs. Grafts were placed on either the dura or the spinal cord. Interruption of the graft's circulation was examined. To study the effect, the artery of the graft was injected with contrast and the graft-dura interface studied histologically. All injected specimens demonstrated vascular connections from the graft to the neural elements. The graft was found to decrease postoperative perineural scarring. The omentum appears to possess properties that could be applied to improve outcomes in spinal surgery. 
5	Central airway obstruction due to cytomegalovirus-induced necrotizing tracheitis in a patient with AIDS. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) can present as either disseminated disease, pneumonitis, retinitis, gastroenteritis, neuropathy, or a subclinical infection. We report a patient whose initial manifestation of CMV infection was severe central airways obstruction due to necrotizing tracheitis. At bronchoscopy, the lesion appeared deeply ulcerated, distinctly different from previously described airway lesions in patients with AIDS. Mucosal biopsies showed characteristic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions and cultures yielded only CMV. The patient responded partially to ganciclovir, steroids, and antibiotics against suspected anaerobic superinfection but died as a result of central nervous system disease believed due to toxoplasmosis or lymphoma. CMV infection of the upper airway should be considered in the patient with AIDS presenting with atypical cough or stridor and ulcerated endobronchial lesions. 
5	Long-term results of revision endolymphatic sac surgery. The results of revision endolymphatic sac surgery on 30 patients with unilateral Meniere's disease are presented. Good control is achieved in 73.3 per cent of cases at six months, falling to 56.7 per cent at one year and only 33.3 per cent by four years. The long-term results are disappointing but are more favourable if the initial surgery was successful, if the hearing remains fluctuant and improves on glycerol dehydration prior to the revision procedure and also if the sac is intubated. The current place of endolymphatic sac surgery is discussed and revision surgery only recommended for carefully selected cases. 
1	Platelet factor 4 mRNA expression in cells from a patient with megakaryoblastic crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia. A 61-year-old man with Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia developed megakaryoblastic leukemia. In the blast phase, his blast cells showed undifferentiated megakaryoblastic characteristics with no alpha-granules or demarcation membranes but with detectable platelet peroxidase (PPO) activity and surface glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa. The patient has remained reasonably well for at least 12 months after blastic crisis, and 6-mercaptopurine alone has been effective in controlling leukocytosis and megakaryoblast proliferation. The expression of mRNA for platelet-specific proteins, such as GPIIb and platelet factor 4 (PF4), was studied in the patient's blast cells by the Northern blot analysis. Both GPIIb and PF4 mRNA were detected in the blast cells. Cytoplasmic maturation occurs later than the synthesis of the surface GP during megakaryocyte maturation. Therefore, PF4 mRNA expression should be a marker of mature megakaryoblasts. The PF4 mRNA expression in megakaryoblastic leukemia may indicate that a patient will have long survival and a good response to chemotherapy. 
1	Persistent carcinoma in situ of the testis after chemotherapy for advanced testicular germ cell tumours. The chemosensitivity of testicular carcinoma in situ (CIS) was analysed in 25 testes excised 10 weeks to 4.5 years following platinum-based chemotherapy. CIS was present in 8 of the 23 evaluable cases (35%), in 5 of which the lesion coexisted with invasive germ cell tumour. It is concluded that CIS may persist or recur after chemotherapy. This has implications for occult presentation of metastatic germ cell tumours and also for the management of the contralateral testis in patients with testicular germ cell tumours. 
2	Expandable biliary metal stents for malignancies: endoscopic insertion and diathermic cleaning for tumor ingrowth. Seventeen patients with malignant biliary strictures have been treated by endoscopic insertion of self-expandable metallic prostheses. Two patients received two prostheses inserted simultaneously in both the left and right hepatic ducts for Klatskin tumor type III. Immediate results were satisfactory despite an operative mortality of 18%, and neither early nor late clogging was observed even in patients who presented previously with sludge above plastic stents that were removed. However, among five patients followed for more than 4 months, two presented with obstruction due to tumor ingrowth into the stent through the metallic mesh. Accordingly, initial enthusiasm concerning long-term patency of these stents has decreased. However, we describe a technique of "diathermic cleaning" of tumor ingrowth which can easily restore the stent patency. The advantages of these wire mesh 30 F stents are their easier insertion, better immediate drainage, and absence of dislocation or perforation. 
1	Mortality among aerial pesticide applicators and flight instructors: a reprint [corrected and republished article originally printed in Arch Environ Health 1990 Sep-Oct;45(5):295-302] A cohort mortality study was conducted of male aerial pesticide applicators and flight instructors identified from computerized Federal Aviation Administration medical examination records from 1965-1979. Vital status of 9,677 applicators and 9,727 instructors was determined through January 1, 1980, and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated. The overall SMR was 127 for applicators (699 deaths) and 93 for instructors (454 deaths). Fatalities from nonmotor vehicle accidents, mostly aircraft crashes, were in notable excess (SMR = 1,168 among applicators, 630 among instructors), whereas deaths from most chronic diseases, including all cancer, was below expectation (e.g., for arteriosclerotic heart disease, SMR = 52 among applicators and 50 among instructors). The ability of the study to assess cancer risk among applicators was limited by a relatively brief follow-up period. However, 8 applicators (SMR = 171), but only 1 flight instructor (SMR = 24), died of leukemia, and small, nonsignificant risk elevations for some other cancer sites among applicators were observed and warrant continued follow-up. 
1	Use of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis and management of posterior fossa hemangioblastomas. The diagnosis of central nervous system hemangioblastoma as well as the surgical treatment requires the accurate radiologic visualization of both the cystic and solid components of the tumor. We report two cases of posterior fossa hemangioblastoma examined with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, which clearly defined the tumor nodule that was not visualized on noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging, contrast-enhanced computed tomography scans, or angiography. In both cases the operative findings precisely correlated with the gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance image. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is the examination of choice for preoperative evaluation of posterior fossa hemangioblastoma. In cases of von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, magnetic resonance imaging is a useful tool for clinical screening as well as follow-up. 
3	Outcome of pregnancies experienced during residency. To investigate potential adverse effects of residency training on pregnancy outcome, a cohort study was conducted among 45 university-affiliated residency programs. Outcomes of the first pregnancy experienced during residency were compared between 92 female residents and 144 spouses of male residents. Despite long hours, sleep deprivation, and an increase in perceived stress, the female residents were as likely to give birth to a live, full-term newborn as the spouses of male residents. For white cohort members, an increased risk of premature labor without delivery was identified (RR = 12.3, 95% confidence interval 2.4-61.6). No significant differences were found in prematurity, spontaneous and therapeutic abortions, or presence of congenital abnormalities in the infants. Method of delivery and use of anesthetics and of other medications were similar in both groups. Pregnancy outcomes between the two groups were similar; however, the increased risk for premature labor among female residents is a cause for concern and should be further investigated. 
1	Premorphological metabolic changes in human breast carcinogenesis. Malignant breast tissue is characterized by morphological and metabolic changes when compared with normal breast tissue. In this study, the cytochemical measurement of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was used to detect abnormal metabolism in breast tissue and to determine whether abnormal metabolic activity precedes morphological change during human breast carcinogenesis. Normal and benign breast tissue, morphologically normal tissue from cancer-containing breasts, and malignant breast tissue were studied. In malignant tissue, mean(s.e.m.) G6PD activity was significantly increased when compared with normal and benign tissue (9.69(2.3) versus 27.02(1.7) mean integrated extinction (MIE) x 100, P less than 0.01). G6PD activity was increased in morphologically normal tissue from cancer-containing breasts when compared with normal and benign breast tissue from breasts with no known cancer (27.02(1.7) versus 18.42(2.6) MIE x 100, P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that metabolic abnormalities precede morphological changes in breast carcinogenesis. Abnormal metabolism can be detected widely within a cancer-containing breast. The detection of such abnormality may prove helpful in identifying patients at high risk of developing breast cancer. 
4	Massive hemorrhage from an arterioureteral fistula associated with chronic renal transplant failure. A case of arterioureteral fistula from the graft artery stump of a failed transplant and the native ureter is reported. This case illustrates one of the possible complications of graft anastomosis. The etiological factors involved in the formation of the aneurysm and eventually the fistula are discussed. 
5	Clinical experience with biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Biliary lithotripsy is a new and important development in the nonsurgical management of gallbladder, cystic duct, and bile duct stones. Most patients do not require general or epidural anesthesia with newer second-generation machines. Patient selection and the use of adjuvant therapy to aid fragment clearance are important issues that are discussed. Results from different centers are compared but few long-term results are yet available, i.e., longer than 18 months. 
4	A study of the effectiveness of the iron-chelating agent deferoxamine as vasospasm prophylaxis in a rabbit model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. The pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm occurring after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is unknown. Several lines of experimentation have suggested a free radical mechanism in the etiology of vasospasm. Iron is an important catalyst in the generation of free radicals and lipid peroxides in response to tissue injury. We hypothesize that the elaboration of iron from the subarachnoid clot might result in enhanced generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation. If so, then treatment with deferoxamine, an iron-chelating compound, might reduce the formation of free radicals and thereby ameliorate vasospasm. This hypothesis was examined in a rabbit model of experimental cerebral vasospasm. New Zealand White rabbits were divided into the following experimental groups: control (normal) animals (n = 7), control animals treated with deferoxamine (n = 3), animals subjected to SAH and killed on Day 2 (n = 7), animals subjected to SAH on Day 2 and treated with deferoxamine (n = 9), animals subjected to SAH killed on Day 3 (n = 7), and animals subjected to SAH on Day 3 and treated with deferoxamine (n = 7). Deferoxamine treatment (50 mg/kg/8 hours) was begun 16 hours before the induction of SAH and continued until the animals were killed by perfusion fixation. The basilar artery caliber was assessed using morphometric techniques. The diameter of the basilar arteries in the control animals was 0.64 +/- 0.02 mm. Deferoxamine treatment alone did not alter the artery diameter. 
3	Lens opacity as a predictor of visual field impairment due to cataract. The contribution of cataract to the decrease of visual field in patients with glaucoma is difficult to ascertain. To attempt to quantitate the change in visual field due to cataract, we examined 27 eyes of 26 patients before and after cataract extraction. The examination consisted of measurement of best refraction with visual acuity, visual field testing with the pupil dilated, measurement of lens opacity, determination of the intraocular pressure, and evaluation of the character of the cataract before surgery and of the posterior capsule after surgery. The results reaffirmed the detrimental effect that cataract may have on the visual field but also showed that the heterogeneity of cataracts limits the usefulness of the lens opacity meter in quantitating the extent of visual field loss due to cataract. 
4	Methodology of sodium sensitivity assessment. The example of age and sex. This article addresses the methodology of sodium sensitivity assessment. There have been reports to suggest that a high sodium intake is a cause of elevated blood pressure and trials to indicate that a reduction in sodium intake may reduce blood pressure that is already high; the implications of these findings are discussed. Many studies on sodium sensitivity suffer from what could be called the "normal probability fallacy"; without appropriate control conditions, an intervention such as sodium restriction may incorrectly be assigned to a more pronounced response in a subgroup of the study population. As an example, findings are reviewed of age and sex as determinants of a response of blood pressure to variations in sodium intake. The limited data available suggest that subjects that are older and have higher blood pressure levels seem to benefit more from a reduction in sodium intake. In addition, elderly subjects at a high dietary sodium intake may have a higher risk of developing hypertension. Findings in both nonexperimental and experimental studies tend to support this view. Findings on sex differences are less consistent. A systematic approach to the assessment of factors and mechanisms responsible for sodium sensitivity in some subjects is needed to determine who might benefit most. Until more data are available, there is little basis to discriminate sodium-sensitive from sodium-resistant hypertensive subjects. 
4	Surgery for Ebstein's anomaly: the clinical and echocardiographic evaluation of a new technique. Ten consecutive patients (age range 4 to 44 years, mean 22) underwent surgical repair of Ebstein's anomaly by vertical plication of the right ventricle and reimplantation of the tricuspid valve leaflets. No patient died during or after operation. Intraoperative postbypass echocardiography documented a good result in nine patients but severe tricuspid regurgitation in one patient, who then underwent prosthetic valve replacement during a second period of cardiopulmonary bypass. Two of four patients who had had right ventricular papillary muscle dysfunction in the early postoperative period showed improved papillary muscle function with concomitant reduction of tricuspid regurgitation 6 months later. All patients were evaluated clinically and by echocardiography 2 to 23 months later. All patients showed clinical improvement, seven by one functional class and three by two classes. All were in sinus rhythm. The mean cardiothoracic ratio decreased by 6% (p less than 0.05). On bicycle ergometry performed in six patients, peak oxygen consumption exceeded 20 ml/kg per min in five. Tricuspid regurgitation diminished in eight patients (by three grades in two patients, by two grades in five and by one grade in one patient); it remained unchanged in two. Comparison of preoperative and postoperative pulsed Doppler flow velocities across the pulmonary valve showed an increase in the peak velocity of flow across the valve (mean 83 +/- 14 versus 97 +/- 11 cm/s, p less than 0.005) and a decrease in the time to peak velocity (mean 130 +/- 16 versus 91 +/- 23 ms, p less than 0.05). 
1	Lipomatous hamartoma of the orbit. Proliferations of mature adipose tissue, while common in retroperitoneal and subcutaneous sites, rarely occur in the orbit. We describe the clinical, radiographic, and histopathologic findings of a nonencapsulated lipomatous tissue overgrowth of the right orbit in a 35-year-old man. The mass had caused proptosis since childhood and was apparently present since birth. Due to the age at onset, the histologic similarity to normal orbital fat, and the lack of encapsulation or choristomatous elements, we propose the term lipomatous hamartoma for this entity. 
1	Risk of cancer death in first-degree relatives of patients with hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (Lynch type II): a study of 130 kindreds in the United Kingdom. To estimate the relative risks of cancer in first-degree relatives of index patients, 130 pedigrees of dominantly inherited Lynch type II cancer family syndrome have been analysed. The risk of death from all causes was significantly increased in women over 45 years of age and the overall liability to cancer in women was greater than for men. A sevenfold increase in risk of colon cancer was found in both sexes. In female relatives the risk of breast cancer was increased fivefold and lifetime risk of breast cancer was 1 in 3.7. A screening programme based on estimated risks could be offered to first-degree relatives of index patients with Lynch type II cancer family syndrome. 
1	Primary neoplasms of the hollow organs of the gastrointestinal tract. Staging and follow-up. The number of imaging modalities available to stage and follow-up patients with primary neoplasms of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract continues to increase. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and ultrasonography are useful techniques for both staging and follow-up. For staging, CT is most frequently used for the detection of liver metastases and is increasingly used as a substitute for the chest radiograph in the detection of lung metastases. CT is still the imaging test of choice for the preoperative staging of esophageal carcinoma. CT is less helpful in staging the patient with gastric carcinoma or colorectal carcinoma. The current usefulness of MRI in the staging of GI tract malignancies is limited by the lack of an adequate oral intraluminal contrast agent and degradation of images due to motion. Sonography, especially the new technique of endoscopic ultrasound, is promising for the detection of local invasion from GI tract malignancies. CT is used in the follow-up of patients with tumors of the GI tract to detect liver, adrenal, and nodal metastases as well as local recurrence because of the ability of CT to detect extraluminal masses. CT of the pelvis has been recommended as a routine follow-up procedure in patients who have undergone abdominal-peroneal resection. Both CT and MRI can be used to detect local recurrence, but suffer from the inability to differentiate scar from recurrent tumor. The initial hope that MRI would be capable of differentiating postoperative scar tissue from recurrent tumor has not been realized. Therefore, with positive CT or MRI findings, occasionally a percutaneous biopsy will be required to confirm local recurrence. 
5	Care of diabetic patients by optometrists in New York State. OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to learn about the involvement of optometrists in the eye care of diabetic patients in New York and to collect baseline data for planning intervention programs in diabetic eye disease. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted by a mail survey being sent to all optometrists in New York whom we could identify through state sources (n = 2270). Three follow-up mailings were conducted. RESULTS: Eighty-six percent who received our mailing responded, 87% of whom reported that they see diabetic patients. Analysis was confined to this 87%. Routine retinal examinations were provided by 68% of the respondents who see diabetic patients, 62% of whom dilate the pupils. Sixty-eight percent who see diabetic patients diagnose retinopathy solely by their own examination, and 60% of these dilate. Follow-up of retinopathy was provided by 15% of optometrists who see diabetic patients, 90% of whom dilate the pupils of their diabetic patients. Twenty-five percent of respondents who see diabetic patients refer them to an ophthalmologist for diagnosis of retinopathy, and 67% refer all retinopathy patients to an ophthalmologist for follow-up. Although 91% of respondents recommended eye examinations at least annually for diabetic patients, only 68% specifically recommended annual examinations through dilated pupils. Those who dilate were significantly more likely to recommend annual dilated examinations than those who do not dilate, regardless of practice setting. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that optometrists as a group see many diabetic patients. Intervention strategies should include increased emphasis on the use of dilation when examining diabetic patients and annual dilated retinal examinations. 
1	Cytotoxic chemotherapy induces cell differentiation in small-cell lung carcinoma. Despite the high response rates resulting from chemotherapy, the majority of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients relapse with chemoresistant tumors. To analyze the phenotypic changes that are precursors of chemoresistant status, and to investigate the role of chemotherapy in these changes, tumor samples from 20 patients, taken before chemotherapy (etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) and again at the onset of chemoresistance (after at least three courses of chemotherapy), were compared. The histologic changes were minor in 10 of 20 patients, as shown by an increase in cell size; they were major in 10 of 20 patients, with the appearance of mixed composite tumors in which neuroendocrine (NE), epidermoid, and glandular components were mixed. Major changes correlated with a good response to chemotherapy (P = .001). Ultrastructural studies showed an increase in neurosecretory granules and desmosomes, and a high frequency of multidirectional differentiation (45%) when comparison was made with pretherapy samples (10%) (P less than .01). Immunohistochemical (IH) analysis showed an increase in cytokeratin (CK) expression in treated patients, with a different labeling pattern and the expression of higher molecular weight CK. The expression of NE lineage markers (Leu 19, Sy 38, SL 11-14) remained stable, while that of NE differentiation markers (Leu 7, chromogranin) increased in the treated patients. The neuron-specific enolase (NSE) activity remained stable in treated SCLC. Large cells with a more differentiated phenotype and proliferative capacity (as shown by Ki 67 labeling), appeared to be characteristic of treated and secondary chemoresistant SCLC. The acquisition of a more complex phenotype, which correlates with primary response to therapy, implies a drug-induced differentiation in SCLC. 
5	Mucin production by human colonic carcinoma cells correlates with their metastatic potential in animal models of colon cancer metastasis. Patients with mucinous colorectal cancers characteristically present with advanced disease, however, the relationship between mucin production by colon cancer cells and their metastatic potential remains unclear. We therefore sought to define the relationship between mucin production by human colon cancer cells and metastatic ability by employing animal models of colon cancer metastasis. LS LiM 6, a colon carcinoma cell line with high liver metastasizing ability during cecal growth in nude mice produced twofold more metabolically labeled intracellular mucin and secreted four- to fivefold more mucin into the culture medium compared to poorly metastatic parental line LS174T. This was accompanied by a similar elevation in poly(A)+ RNA detected by blot hybridization with a human intestinal mucin cDNA probe, and increases in mucin core carbohydrate antigens determined immunohistochemically. Variants of LS174T selected for high (HM 7) or low (LM 12) mucin synthesizing capacity also yielded metastases after cecal growth and colonized the liver after splenic-portal injection in proportion to their ability to produce mucin. Inhibition of mucin glycosylation by the arylglycoside benzyl-alpha-N-acetyl-galactosamine greatly reduced liver colonization after splenic-portal injection of the tumor cells. These data suggest that mucin production by human colon cancer cells correlates with their metastatic potential and affects their ability to colonize the liver in experimental model systems. 
5	Treatment of advanced neuroblastoma with I-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine. From February 1986 to December 1988, 31 children with advanced pretreated neuroblastoma were treated with 131-I meta-Iodobenzylguanidine (131-MIBG). Thirteen children had been resistant to first-line therapy, three had suffered a local relapse, and fourteen had suffered a disseminated relapse without over bone marrow infiltration. One child was treated initially because of resistance to first-line therapy, and subsequently for a local relapse. A total of 72 courses of 131-MIBG was administered, with doses ranging from 2.8 to 6.0 GBq (median, 3.7 GBq). One child received five courses, two four courses, 13 three courses, four two courses, and 12 one course of 131-MIBG. The most common toxic effect was thrombocytopenia, with a platelet level of less than 50,000/cmm occurring after 19 of 60 evaluable courses. A leukocyte count less than 1000/cmm was seen only once. There were six major responses (two complete) lasting 4 to 9 months, and two minor responses lasting longer than 38 and 44 months. Responses were seen more commonly in children whose only lesion was a residual primary tumor and in children who had not been pretreated who experienced disseminated relapse. Further studies of the role of 131-I meta-Iodobenzylguanidine in treatment of neuroblastoma are needed. 
1	Carcinoma of the pancreas: a retrospective review. Eighty-five patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were reviewed in order to evaluate the efficacy of our methods of diagnosis and treatment. The most useful diagnostic test was percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) with a diagnostic rate of 96%. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) and total pancreatic resection were performed in 13 and 2 patients, respectively. The remaining 50 patients underwent various palliative drainage procedures. Twenty patients did not undergo operation for various reasons. The primary tumor was found in the head of the pancreas in 50 patients (59%), the body in 6 patients (7%), and in the tail in 8 patients (9%). Postoperative complications, including sepsis, bleeding, intra-abdominal abscesses, and anastomotic leaks, occurred in 37% of the patients. There were one operative and 9 postoperative deaths. The average survival for those patients undergoing surgical intervention was 6 months. There were no 5-year survivors. 
5	Endometriosis associated with massive ascites and absence of pelvic peritoneum. Although massive ascites associated with endometriosis has been reported in rare cases, this patient was also noted to have massive destruction of the pelvic peritoneum. Failure of medical suppression necessitated total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Several months after surgery ascites resolved, possibly with reestablishment of the pelvic peritoneum. 
5	Utility of upper endoscopy in the evaluation of noncardiac chest pain. The diagnostic yield of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal manometry, and Bernstein testing was assessed in 100 consecutive patients being evaluated for non-cardiac chest pain. Manometric studies revealed the nutcracker esophagus in 21 patients; non-specific esophageal motility disorders in 19 patients; a hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter in 4 patients; diffuse esophageal spasm in 2 patients; and normal motility in 54 patients. Endoscopy was normal in 38 patients; but revealed grades II to IV esophagitis in 24 patients; gastritis and/or duodenitis in 18 patients; a sliding hiatal hernia without evidence of esophagitis in 14 patients; and gastric or duodenal ulcers in 6 patients. Twenty-five individuals were found to have normal manometric studies in combination with a negative Bernstein test. Among these 25 patients, however, 7 patients had esophagitis (grade II or higher); 6 patients had gastritis and/or duodenitis; five patients had a sliding hiatal hernia without esophagitis; 1 patient had peptic ulcer disease; and only 6 patients had a normal endoscopic exam. Our results indicate that endoscopy can identify a significant number of patients with acid-peptic disease who present with non-cardiac chest pain, that would not have been otherwise diagnosed by esophageal manometry or Bernstein testing alone or in combination. 
4	Clinical, radiographic, and hemodynamic correlations in chronic congestive heart failure: conflicting results may lead to inappropriate care. PURPOSE: Clinical and radiographic examinations are commonly used for estimating severity and titrating therapy of chronic congestive heart failure. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between findings on history, physical examination, chest roentgenogram, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients with chronic congestive heart failure, referred for evaluation for heart transplantation, were studied; all patients underwent history, physical examination, upright chest roentgenogram, and cardiac catheterization. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.06. Patients were divided into three groups according to their PCWP: Group 1, normal PCWP (less than or equal to 15 mm Hg, n = 19); Group 2, mild to moderately elevated PCWP (16 to 29 mm Hg, n = 15); Group 3, markedly elevated PCWP (greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg, n = 18). RESULTS: Physical and radiographic signs of congestion were more common in the groups with higher PCWP, but they could not be used to reliably separate patients with different filling pressures. Physical findings (orthopnea, edema, rales, third heart sound, elevated jugular venous pressure) or radiographic signs (cardiomegaly, vascular redistribution, and interstitial and alveolar edema) had poor predictive value for identifying patients with PCWP values greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg. These findings had poor negative predictive value to exclude significantly elevated PCWP (greater than 20 mm Hg). Radiographic pulmonary congestion was absent in eight (53%) patients in Group 2 and seven (39%) in Group 3. In patients in Group 2 and 3, those without radiographic congestion were in a better New York Heart Association functional class (3.5 +/- 0.5 versus 2.8 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.01). There was good correlation between right atrial pressure and PCWP (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001). A normal right atrial pressure had no predictive value, but a pressure greater than 10 mm Hg was seen in all but one patient with a PCWP value greater than 20 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: Clinical, radiographic, and hemodynamic evaluations of chronic congestive heart failure yield conflicting results. Absence of radiographic or physical signs of congestion does not ensure normal PCWP values and may lead to inaccurate diagnosis and inadequate therapy. It is not known whether therapy aimed at normalizing PCWP is superior to relieving clinical and radiographic signs of congestion. 
4	Relation between intraventricular pressure and volume in diastole. The pressure-volume curves for 10 patients with various types of heart disease were studied throughout mid to late diastole when both pressure and volume were increasing. The results were used to test a currently held theory that the form of this relation is exponential. It was found that for the patients examined this hypothesis was not valid. 
4	Abnormal cardiac sensitivity in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries. The causes of chest pain in patients found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries during cardiac catheterization remain controversial. Cardiac sensitivity to catheter manipulation, pacing at various stimulus intensities and intracoronary injection of contrast medium was examined in several groups of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization. Right heart (especially right ventricular) catheter manipulation and pacing and intracoronary contrast medium provoked chest pain typical of that previously experienced in 29 (81%) of 36 patients with chest pain and angiographically normal coronary arteries and 15 (46%) of 33 symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In contrast, only 2 (6%) of 33 symptomatic patients with coronary artery disease experienced their typical chest pain with these sensitivity tests (p less than 0.001). None of 10 patients with valvular heart disease but without a chest pain syndrome experienced any sensation with these tests. Cutaneous pain threshold testing demonstrated that patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries had a higher pain threshold to thermal stimulation compared with patients who had coronary artery disease or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. No relation existed between cardiac sensitivity and cutaneous sensitivity testing. Thus, patients who have chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries may have abnormal cardiac sensitivity to a variety of stimuli. This increased sensitivity may be of causal importance to their chest pain syndrome or may contribute to their perception of ischemia-induced pain. The same phenomenon was also commonly seen in symptomatic patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Whether this phenomenon represents abnormal activation of pain receptors within the heart or abnormal processing of visceral afferent neural impulses in the peripheral or central nervous system is unknown. 
2	Immunological studies before and during interferon therapy in chronic HBV infection: identification of factors predicting response. Lymphoblastoid interferon is effective therapy in some but not all patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. To assess whether immunological parameters were predictive of response to interferon therapy, we determined the human leukocyte antigen type, CD4/CD8 ratio, natural killer cell activity, IgM anti-HBc antibody levels and concanavalin A-induced lymphocyte proliferative response in 30 patients before treatment. In addition, to investigate the mechanisms of action of interferon in promoting hepatitis B virus clearance, we serially measured the CD4/CD8 ratios, natural killer activity and lymphocyte proliferative response at wk 4, 8 and 12 of treatment. A beneficial response to therapy was defined as the sustained clearance of HBeAg and serum hepatitis B virus DNA within 1 yr of commencing therapy. Elevated IgM anti-HBc levels were associated with a beneficial response to therapy, but there was no correlation observed between response and pretreatment CD4/CD8 ratio, natural killer activity or lymphocyte proliferative response. Six of seven human leukocyte antigen DR3-positive patients responded. No measurable changes in the immunological parameters studied were observed in the nonresponder group, whereas a significant rise in CD4/CD8 ratio, associated with a fall in peripheral CD8 number and a decline in measurable NK activity, was seen in the responder group. These changes were maximal at the time of hepatitis B virus DNA clearance, which was associated with a transient increase in hepatic inflammation. 
5	Symptomatic pancreatic heterotopia treated by local excision. Non-ulcer dyspepsia is a continuing problem and in many cases a precise cause is never identified. We present five patients with an allegedly uncommon condition--pancreatic heterotopia. They were managed by local excision of the tumour and after a mean (range) follow up of 42 (9-80) months all remain free of the original symptoms. 
4	Prognosis of hospital survivors after salvage from cardiopulmonary bypass with centrifugal cardiac assist. Since October 1986, 6 hospital survivors who were salvaged from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) with the Sarns centrifugal pump were observed. Centrifugal assist was employed only after failure to wean with usual resuscitative measures, including multiple high dose inotropes and intraaortic balloon pumping. There were five men and one woman, 46-59 years of age (mean 61 years). All patients had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting, with two patients having had concomitant left ventricular aneurysmectomy and two aortic valve replacement. Five patients had left ventricular assist only and one had biventricular assist. Duration of assist ranged from 26 to 72 hr (mean 48 hr). Complications were ubiquitous, and the resultant prolonged hospitalization was resource intensive. All hospital survivors remain alive and are in New York Heart Association functional Class II, with an average follow-up of 24 months, (6-41 months). Compared with preoperative values, current left ventricular function is improved in 2 patients, has deteriorated in 3, and is unchanged in 1. Thus, the Sarns centrifugal pump will allow salvage of some patients who otherwise are not weanable from CPB. Survivors can expect a reasonable functional capacity as reflected by this experience. 
4	Hemodynamic and endocrine effects of mental stress in untreated borderline hypertension. Mental arithmetic and mirror tracing were compared in 40 untreated patients with borderline hypertension, tested in random sequence in standardized protocols. Both tasks significantly increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, plasma renin, and decreased peripheral resistance. Mental arithmetic also increased cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL; plasma catecholamines were not changed significantly. Lipid changes were correlated with blood pressure changes. These methods will be useful in exploring the relationships between hemodynamic reactivity to stress, and the presence and progression of atherosclerosis, as well as testing the effects of antihypertensive drugs on stress-induced changes that may influence atherosclerotic complications of hypertension. 
2	Comparative studies of DU-PAN-2, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9 in the serum and bile of patients with pancreatic and biliary tract diseases: evaluation of the influence of obstructive jaundice. The levels of DU-PAN-2 antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA19-9 in serum and bile of patients with pancreatic and biliary tract diseases were measured. The sensitivities (true positive) of DU-PAN-2 in serum to pancreatic carcinoma (64%) and to biliary tract carcinoma (62%) were similar to those of CA19-9 in serum (69% and 72%, respectively). Nine of 18 (50%) patients with CA19-9-negative pancreatic carcinoma tested positive for DU-PAN-2. The sensitivities of CEA to pancreatic carcinoma (56%) and to biliary tract carcinoma (52%) were lowest. The measurement of these antigens in bile seemed to be of little diagnostic value in differentiating between malignant and benign diseases. False positives of these three assays occurred frequently in patients with benign pancreatic or biliary tract disease coupled with obstructive jaundice. After percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage, serum DU-PAN-2 and CA19-9 levels returned to normal ranges in patients with benign diseases, but not in patients with carcinoma of the pancreas or of the biliary tract. Serum CA19-9 and DU-PAN-2 antigens are useful tumor markers for pancreatic and biliary tract carcinomas. Longitudinal assays of these antigens may be useful for the differential diagnosis of patients with obstructive jaundice. 
3	Lip paresthesia associated with a jaw mass. A case is reported in which mandibular swelling and lower lip numbness were the first signs of a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the lung. The development of paresthesia, with or without other oral symptoms, requires that a diagnosis of malignancy be considered until confirmed or ruled out by tissue biopsy. A thorough head and neck examination in all patients, especially in those whose history or habits may indicate increased risk of malignancy is necessary. 
1	Treatment of high-risk solid tumors of childhood with intensive therapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation. Autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) allows delivery of intensive, marrow-ablative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy to children with high-risk solid tumors. Results from several studies of neuroblastoma suggest that outcome is improved by ABMT; however, relapses can occur months to years after complete clinical remission. Other high-risk tumors including peripheral neuroepithelioma, Ewing's sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Wilms' tumor, and brain tumors also appear to be responsive to intensive marrow-ablative therapy, although few studies have been reported. For tumors that can metastasize to marrow, a sensitive method is necessary for detecting tumor cell contamination. Immunocytologic analysis with monoclonal antibodies can identify one neuroblastoma cell per 10(5) normal marrow cells; this method also is applicable to other tumors with appropriate antibodies. Ex vivo removal (purging) of tumor cells decreases the probability of infusing tumorigenic cells with the ABMT. There is considerable experience in tumor detection and purging for neuroblastoma, but little has been done for other childhood solid tumors. Future investigations of ABMT will aim to further increase disease-free survival by intensifying induction and marrow-ablative regimens and by developing therapies to be given after ABMT that are directed at minimal residual disease. As pilot investigations mature, the efficacy of ABMT and conventional chemotherapy will be compared in multi-institution randomized studies. 
5	Blood rheology after cardiac valve replacement with mechanical prostheses or bioprostheses. Arterial thromboembolism is a serious complication in patients after heart valve replacement. Abnormalities in blood rheology may contribute to this complication. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare various determinants of blood rheology in patients with substitute heart valves with those in healthy controls; furthermore, differences between patients with mechanical valves and those with bioprostheses should be investigated. The hemorrheologic determinants--fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, hematocrit and platelet aggregation--were studied in 92 patients with mechanical bileaflet valves, in 28 patients with bioprostheses and in 29 control subjects; the time since valve replacement was greater than or equal to 9 months. Fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, red cell and spontaneous platelet aggregation were found to be increased in all patients after heart valve replacement compared with normal subjects (fibrinogen: 348 +/- 87 vs 267 +/- 66 mg/dl, p less than 0.01; plasma viscosity: 1.71 +/- 0.1 vs 1.66 +/- 0.1 mPas, p less than 0.05; red cell aggregation: 9.9 +/- 2 vs 7.8 +/- 2 U, p less than 0.01; platelet aggregation: 22 +/- 15 vs 13 +/- 13%, p less than 0.01); among patients, fibrinogen, plasma viscosity and spontaneous platelet aggregation were higher in mechanical valves than in bioprostheses (fibrinogen: 359 +/- 95 vs 314 +/- 41 mg/dl, p less than 0.01; plasma viscosity: 1.72 +/- 0.1 vs 1.68 +/- 0.1 mPas, p less than 0.1; platelet aggregation: 23 +/- 15 vs 16 +/- 11%; p less than 0.05), whereas no difference could be found for red cell aggregation (9.7 +/- 2 vs 10.5 +/- 2%, p greater than 0.05). 
5	Acute respiratory disease in Spain: seven years of experience The clinical and epidemiologic features of viral and nonviral pathogens involved in acute respiratory diseases are described in the context of cases of infection (especially atypical pneumonia and bronchiolitis) studied at the Centro Nacional de Microbiologia, Virologia e Immunologia Sanitarias in Madrid during a 7-year period (1979-1986). These etiologies were demonstrated in 1,637 (36.2%) of 4,521 cases. Among viruses, respiratory syncytial virus most frequently infected children; influenza virus showed the same pattern of circulation as in other European countries. Of nonviral agents, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and C. burnetii were most often involved in lower respiratory tract infections, with a variable predominance in patients of different ages. A high proportion of cases of M. pneumoniae infection occurred in infants and children aged less than 1 year, and most of these cases occurred during spring and summer. The majority of Q fever cases, including those observed in two outbreaks, occurred in the northern region. 
5	The reliability of frozen sections in the evaluation of surgical margins for melanoma. As the width of surgical margins declines, histologic evaluation of the margins is needed to assess the completeness of excision of a malignant melanoma. We studied 221 specimens in 59 patients and compared the interpretations of frozen and paraffin sections from the same block. Frozen sections had a sensitivity of 100% in detecting melanoma when present and a specificity of 90%. 
1	Chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome after the treatment of head and neck cancer. A case report. A 62-year-old woman who was being treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck developed a chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome during the second cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, bleomycin, and methotrexate. Though the syndrome was suspected early, attempts at reversing the hematologic and renal abnormalities were unsuccessful. At postmortem examination, the characteristic microvascular lesions of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome were found in the kidneys. 
4	Perivascular innervation of the cerebral arteries in spontaneously hypertensive rats--an immunohistochemical study. Perivascular innervation in cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats and of normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats was studied. Adrenergic nerve fibers and neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasoconstrictor nerves, were denser in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats than those of Wistar-Kyoto rats. In contrast, cholinergic nerve fibers and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, substance P-containing nerve fibers, indicative of vasodilator nerves, remained unchanged in all cerebral arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats, as compared with findings in the Wistar-Kyoto rats. Thus, not only adrenergic nerve fibers but also neuropeptide Y-containing nerve fibers may play an important role in preventing the disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the development of hypertensive encephalopathy in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 
1	Surgical management of pericardial effusion in patients with malignancies. Comparison of subxiphoid window versus pericardiectomy. There is a lack of consensus regarding optimal surgical management of symptomatic pericardial effusions in patients with malignancies. Subxiphoid pericardial window formation (subxiphoid pericardial drainage) has been considered a safe and effective method for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. To ensure adequate drainage, many surgeons prefer the formation of a larger pericardial window by performing either an anterior thoracotomy or a partial/total pericardiectomy. To evaluate the efficacy of these methods for palliation of symptomatic pericardial effusion in patients with malignancy, 28 consecutive pericardial surgery cases involving patients with malignancy were retrospectively analyzed. Ten patients (Group 1) had subxiphoid window formation, whereas 18 patients (Group 2) had partial or total pericardiectomy or pericardial window formation by anterior thoracotomy. There was no statistically significant difference (P = 0.22) in the survival rates between these two groups. A median survival time of 2.67 months (range, 0.43 to 26.6 months) was observed in Group 1 versus 1.23 months (range, 0.03 to 10.83 months) in Group 2. However, a statistically significant difference (P less than or equal to 0.02) in postoperative morbidity was observed between the two groups: 67% in Group 2 versus 10% in Group 1. Because of lower morbidity, subxiphoid pericardial window formation is recommended by this study as the preferred surgical method for palliation of symptomatic pericardial effusion in patients with malignancy. 
3	Endoscopic ventricular fenestration using a "saline torch". The fiberoptic endoscope has never gained popularity among neurosurgeons although it is ideally suited for navigating within the cerebral ventricles. Recent advances in optics and miniaturization make the application of endoscopy in neurosurgery more practical. The authors report eight children who underwent ventriculoscopic fenestration of symptomatic loculated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collections. These CSF collections were either isolated ventricular cysts or trapped lateral ventricles secondary to obstruction at the foramen of Monro. Cyst wall dissection was carried out with a "saline torch" dissector which was introduced through a working channel in the ventriculoscope. The torch was used to coagulate vessels and to sculpt large windows in cyst walls or in the septum pellucidum. Ventriculoscope-guided cyst fenestration can be performed safely and easily under direct vision. The technique may permit simplification of shunt systems in some patients and elimination of shunts in others. 
5	Effects of exercise on myocardial catecholamine content and ischemic injury in dogs with gradual coronary occlusion. The effects of exercise on catecholamine content and the extent of myocardial damage in dogs with Ameroid constrictor occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery were determined. Tissue samples from both the anterior and posterior walls of the left ventricle were obtained for determination of catecholamine content, and the rest of the ventricles were processed for histologic examination. When subjected to treadmill exercise for 40 days after surgery, obstructed animals performed significantly less exercise than sham-operated animals and showed significantly higher percentages of ischemia and necrosis in the left ventricle than sedentary, obstructed, sham-operated, or control dogs. Levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine in the posterior wall of the left ventricle were significantly lower than in the other groups. Our data show that exercise in this well-known model of chronic coronary artery stenosis produced deleterious effects on the myocardium and suggest a marked heterogeneity of catecholamine stores in the myocardium that may have important functional and electrophysiologic consequences. 
5	Placenta previa. A placenta previa, whether found fortuitously by ultrasound or with the clinical emergency of maternal hemorrhage, carries significant maternal and fetal risk. Accurate diagnosis, judicious expectant management with transfusion as required, and delivery at the time of fetal lung maturation can lead to the most favorable outcome. Anticipation of the clinical complication of placenta accreta may avoid some serious consequences. Clinical judgement and skill in the performance of cesarean sections, dilatation and curettage, and other forms of uterine invasive techniques may help to keep subsequent incidence of placenta previa at a reasonably low rate. 
4	Cardiac involvement in AIDS. Cardiac involvement in AIDS may occur at any stage of HIV disease and may manifest as congestive cardiomyopathy, potentially lethal arrhythmia, or pericardial effusion and tamponade. The heart may be affected by nearly all of the opportunistic infections and many of the malignancies associated with the syndrome. Although often clinically unobtrusive, cardiac lesions may be important in the pathogenesis of significant clinical symptoms and play an often unrecognized role in the prognosis and natural history of AIDS. 
2	Pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy: atypical presentations. Severe pregnancy-induced hypertension and markedly elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase developed in a 29-year-old-woman in whom one pregnancy resulted in intrauterine death. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy developed with good fetal outcome in the next pregnancy. This case suggests that pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are part of a clinical spectrum. Moreover, classic abnormalities of liver function tests need not be present in acute fatty liver of pregnancy. 
5	The reversibility of canine vein-graft arterialization. We assessed the reversibility of functional and morphological changes of arterialized vein segments by returning them to the venous circulation. Thirteen dogs underwent right carotid and femoral veno-arterial grafting. After 12 weeks, veno-arterial grafts were removed for contractility (norepinephrine [NE] and 5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), luminal prostacyclin (PGI2), and morphometric analyses; the remaining segments were used as left jugular and femoral veno-venous grafts. After another 12 weeks, the veno-venous grafts were harvested. To NE, veno-arterial grafts (ED50, 5.4 +/- 0.1 [-log M]) were less sensitive than control veins (ED50, 6.0 +/- 0.2) or veno-venous grafts (ED50, 6.4 +/- 0.2) but were more sensitive than control arteries (ED50, 4.0 +/- 0.1); the maximum tension of veno-arterial grafts (6.2 +/- 0.6 g) was greater than that of veins, less than that of arteries (9.8 +/- 1.0 g), and comparable with that of veno-venous grafts (5.1 +/- 1.1 g). To 5-HT, veno-arterial (ED50, 7.5 +/- 0.1) and veno-venous (ED50, 7.3 +/- 0.2) grafts were more sensitive than arteries (ED50, 6.0 +/- 0.3), while the vein was unresponsive; the maximum tension of veno-arterial grafts (5.0 +/- 0.7 g) was less than that of arteries (6.9 +/- 0.9 g) and greater than that of veno-venous grafts (1.4 +/- 0.3 g). PGI2 production in veins (3.6 +/- 0.8 ng/ml), veno-arterial grafts (3.9 +/- 0.8 ng/ml), and veno-venous grafts (3.3 +/- 0.9 ng/ml) was comparable and less than that of arteries (6.4 +/- 0.9 ng/ml). Veno-arterial graft intimal thickness (127 +/- 8 microns) and intimal area (15.6 +/- 1.8 x 10(3) microns 2) tended to be greater than that in the veno-venous graft (113 +/- 9 microns and 12.4 +/- 1.8 x 10(3) microns 2); also, the veno-arterial graft medial area (103.0 +/- 7.3 x 10(3) microns 2) was greater than that of the veno-venous graft (80.3 +/- 6.9 x 10(3) microns 2), thereby resulting in a similar relative intimal area (13 +/- 1%). Therefore, some changes associated with arterialization, for example, adrenergic sensitivity, maximum tension to 5-HT, medial thickening, and perhaps intimal hyperplasia, reverted toward venous values when replaced in the venous environment, possibly due to variations in pressure, flow, shear stress, and/or graft preparation techniques. Luminal PGI2 was unchanged in the grafts, implying that graft contractility was not modulated by luminal PGI2. 
5	Ocular manifestations of onchocerciasis in a rain forest area of west Africa. The epidemiology and natural history of onchocerciasis and its ocular complications in rain forest areas are poorly understood. The present study was conducted on a rubber plantation in a hyperendemic area in the rain forest of Liberia, West Africa, where 800 persons were examined. The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes. Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment. Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases. Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%. Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection. Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis. There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy. These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease. 
1	Identical splicing of aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor transcripts from amplified rearranged genes in human glioblastomas. The epidermal growth factor receptor gene has been found to be amplified and rearranged in human glioblastomas in vivo. Here we present the sequence across a splice junction of aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor transcripts derived from corresponding and uniquely rearranged genes that are coamplified and coexpressed with non-rearranged epidermal growth factor receptor genes in six primary human glioblastomas. Each of these six tumors contains aberrant transcripts derived from identical splicing of exon 1 to exon 8 as a consequence of a deletion-rearrangement of the amplified gene, the extent of which is variable among these tumors. In spite of this intertumoral variability, each intragenic rearrangement results in loss of the same 801 coding bases (exons 2-7) and creation of a new codon at the novel splice site in their corresponding transcripts. These rearrangements do not, however, affect the mRNA sequence for the signal peptide, the first five codons, or the reading frame downstream of the rearrangement. 
4	A detachable balloon procedure for a traumatic internal carotid-internal jugular fistula: report of a case A case of a traumatic fistula between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein is reported. The fistula was treated by detachable balloon occlusion and clipping of the internal carotid artery. 
4	Factors determining success and energy requirements for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. Factors thought to affect the success of and energy requirements for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation were studied in 80 (49 male, 31 female) patients aged 21-88 (mean 61.5 years). Transthoracic impedance was measured in advance of the countershock using a 30 kHz low amplitude AC current passed through self-adhesive ECG/defibrillator pads (diameters 8-12 cm) applied to the chest in the antero-posterior (AP) position in 57 patients and the anteroapical (AA) position in 23 patients. Mean transthoracic impedance for all patients was 69.3 +/- 16 (SD) ohms (range 39-131 ohms), but transthoracic impedance was significantly greater in the AA than the AP position (75.4 +/- 13 vs. 66.7 +/- 16 ohms, p = 0.02). Initial energy was 50 J (delivered) and was gradually increased to a maximum of 360 J if required. Cardioversion was successful in 73 of 80 (91.2 per cent), and low energy shocks (less than or equal to 200 J) were successful in 45 of 80 (56.2 per cent) patients. Using single factor analysis, sex, left atrial enlargement, electrode pad positions, aetiology of atrial fibrillation, presence of left ventricular failure, and prior treatment with verapamil or beta-adrenergic blockers were not significant determinants of cardioversion success or success of low energy shocks but prior treatment with digoxin was, both for cardioversion success and success at low energies. In patients with transthoracic impedance less than or equal to 70 ohms, low energy shocks were more often successful (33 or 50, 66 per cent) than in patients with transthoracic impedance greater than 70 ohms (12 of 30, 40 per cent), p = 0.04. Using univariate analysis, cardioversion success with low energy shocks was not only significantly associated with prior treatment with digoxin but also with the duration of atrial fibrillation (24 hours to one month and one month to three years) and for shocks of less than or equal to 100 J, with prior treatment with amiodarone. Multifactorial linear regression analysis selected, in rank order, only duration of atrial fibrillation of 24 hours to less than one month and one month to three years as significant predictors of both cardioversion success irrespective of shock strength, and success of low energy shocks. 
5	Memory complaints in older adults. Fact or fiction? Complaints of poor memory by patients may be an early symptom of a pathologic process like Alzheimer's disease. It is therefore important to determine if patients' complaints of memory impairments are an accurate reflection of real memory disturbance. The relationship between memory complaints (metamemory) and objective memory performance, mood, age, verbal intelligence, and sex was examined in a group of 199 healthy, community dwelling adults (39 to 89 years old). Memory complaints demonstrated a stronger association with depressed mood than with performance on memory tests. Increasing reports of depressive symptoms were associated with more overall memory complaints. Verbal intelligence, age, and sex also contributed to memory complaints. Patients with higher verbal intelligence reported fewer complaints and placed less emphasis on forgetting. Older individuals reported greater frequency of forgetting and greater frequency of using memory techniques. Specific types of memory complaints, seriousness of forgetting, and types of memory aids employed are also described. These results showed that self-rating of memory disturbance by older adults may be related more to depressed mood than to poor performance on memory tests. 
1	Osteoma of the middle ear. Osteomas involving the middle ear and causing a functional disturbance are rare. We report a case of a patient with an osteoma arising from the lateral semicircular canal. The main symptom was vertigo and to halt this the defect of the canal was obliterated with a bone chip and fibrin glue after removal of the tumour. 
1	cDNA cloning and sequencing of human fibrillarin, a conserved nucleolar protein recognized by autoimmune antisera. We have isolated a 1.1-kilobase cDNA clone that encodes human fibrillarin by screening a hepatoma library in parallel with DNA probes derived from the fibrillarin genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (NOP1) and Xenopus laevis. RNA blot analysis indicates that the corresponding mRNA is approximately 1300 nucleotides in length. Human fibrillarin expressed in vitro migrates on SDS gels as a 36-kDa protein that is specifically immunoprecipitated by antisera from humans with scleroderma autoimmune disease. Human fibrillarin contains an amino-terminal repetitive domain approximately 75-80 amino acids in length that is rich in glycine and arginine residues and is similar to amino-terminal domains in the yeast and Xenopus fibrillarins. The occurrence of a putative RNA-binding domain and an RNP consensus sequence within the protein is consistent with the association of fibrillarin with small nucleolar RNAs. Protein sequence alignments show that 67% of amino acids from human fibrillarin are identical to those in yeast fibrillarin and that 81% are identical to those in Xenopus fibrillarin. This identity suggests the evolutionary conservation of an important function early in the pathway for ribosome biosynthesis. 
1	Advances in molecular biology. Potential impact on diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the thyroid. Advances in molecular biology research continue to have a major impact on clinical medicine. These advances have provided a means to produce proteins previously available in limited supply and allow for the production of novel proteins that are improved agonists or else antagonists with greater specificity for therapeutic targets. Newer drug delivery systems should facilitate delivery of these proteins. By combining the capabilities to produce drug targets in acceptable quantities with improved methods for determining the three-dimensional structures of these targets, novel organic therapeutic molecules that act on these targets will be designed. Gene transfer therapy using genes that express important proteins or that encode "antisense" RNAs that inhibit the translation of specific mRNAs will soon become a reality. The use of RFLPs and PCR methodologies promises increased means to diagnose specific genetic diseases and infections. Most importantly, molecular biology is helping to understand the mechanisms of disease such that novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches can be described. These advances are providing an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cancers of the thyroid gland. They have already led to an enhanced understanding of (1) the growth factors that control proliferation of the thyroid gland, (2) the potential steps in thyroid nodule and neoplasia development, (3) particular mutations that may occur as thyroid cancers develop, (4) oncogenes that are expressed in thyroid cancers, and (5) the genetic defects that are responsible for thyroid gland malignancies in the multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) syndromes. With the latter, the RFLP technology has already provided an enhanced means to diagnose the disorder. With further progress, enhanced means for diagnosis and treatment should emerge. Molecular biology techniques are contributing to an increased understanding of the mechanisms of development of autoimmune thyroid disease as with Graves' disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The potential role of infections, histocompatibility antigens, thyroid gland and extraglandular antigens, immune modulators, subpopulations of T-cells such as suppressor and helper cells, other cells involved in immune responses, and a combination of influences of several different functions on the thyroid gland are being defined. This knowledge should soon suggest improved means for diagnosis and treatment. Understanding of the function of the thyroid hormone receptors should have clinical importance. This knowledge suggests a means to develop thyroid hormone antagonists that may be used to more rapidly ameliorate the effects of hyperthyroidism and could be useful in nonthyroidal disorders such as cardiac arrhythmias.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
3	Acute pain relief. Pain is a multidimensional psychophysiologic phenomenon. Systematic multidimensional assessment is an essential first component of an effective plan to relieve the pain. Nurses are key to effective pain management because of the close, 24-hour-a-day relationship with the hospitalized patient. It is the nurse who is most critical to the adequate assessment of pain, to the implementation of the treatment plan, and to the evaluation of efficacy. Nurses should continue to develop a better knowledge base about pain and pain therapies and assessment skills, be assertive in obtaining effective treatment for their patients, and perceive themselves as responsible for pain relief. 
5	Magnetic resonance imaging--the evaluation of choice in residual shunt after congenital heart disease surgery? Accurate anatomic diagnosis presents a dilemma in patients with residual shunt after corrective surgery for congenital heart disease. We describe a patient who, after atrial septal defect repair, developed dyspnea and central cyanosis despite normal pulmonary arterial pressures and right heart chamber size. A role for early MRI is suggested. 
1	Paraneoplastic pemphigus. An autoimmune mucocutaneous disease associated with neoplasia. BACKGROUND and METHODS. We describe five patients with underlying neoplasms in whom painful mucosal ulcerations and polymorphous skin lesions developed, usually with progression to blistering eruptions on the trunk and extremities. Histologic examination showed vacuolization of epidermal basal cells, keratinocyte necrosis, and acantholysis. Immunofluorescence testing revealed atypical pemphigus-like autoantibodies in perilesional epithelium and serum from all five patients. We studied the antigenic specificities of the autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation, using extracts of 14C-labeled human keratinocytes. IgG purified from the serum of one patient was passively transferred to four neonatal mice to test for pathogenicity. RESULTS. Immunofluorescence testing showed that the autoantibodies bound to the surface of tissues containing desmosomes, including complex and simple epithelia, and myocardium. An identical and unique complex of four polypeptides with molecular weights of 250, 230, 210, and 190 was immunoprecipitated by all serum samples. The 250-kd polypeptide comigrated with desmoplakin I (a protein found in the desmosomes of all epithelia), and the 230-kd antigen comigrated with the antigen of bullous pemphigoid. Cutaneous blisters, a positive Nikolsky's sign, and epidermal and esophageal acantholysis developed in all mice into which the autoantibody was injected. Electron microscopy showed epidermal acantholysis similar to lesions of experimentally induced pemphigus vulgaris. CONCLUSION. These five patients with cancer had a novel acantholytic mucocutaneous disease characterized by autoantibodies that were pathogenic after passive transfer. The autoantibodies from these patients reacted with an antigen complex composed of desmoplakin I and the 230-kd antigen of bullous pemphigoid and two as yet unidentified epithelial antigens. We suggest the term "paraneoplastic pemphigus" for this disease. 
5	Hypersensitivity pneumonitis versus invasive pulmonary aspergillosis: two cases with unusual pathologic findings and review of the literature. Two brothers simultaneously exposed to moldy hay, who developed differing forms of Aspergillus-related lung disease, are presented. Patient 1 developed a true case of hypersensitivity lung disease, whereas his brother developed invasive aspergillosis with bronchoalveolar lavage eosinophilia and unusual pathologic features including tissue eosinophilia. The possible overlap between hypersensitivity pneumonitis and invasive aspergillosis in the immunocompetent host is discussed. 
2	Comparison of ulcer surgery at a Veterans Administration and University Hospital. We compared the patient populations and outcome of surgery for peptic ulcer disease in 81 patients at a Veterans Administration Hospital (OVAH) and 97 patients at an affiliated University Hospital (UNH). The surgeons and choice of operation were comparable at both facilities. Patients were similar with respect to severity of ulcer disease, percentage of elderly patients and distribution of comorbid conditions. There were significantly more female patients (45% vs 2%, P less than 0.05), patients less than 40 years old (22% vs 6%, P less than 0.05), and patients with gastric ulcers (27% vs 12%, P less than 0.05) at UNH. Alcoholism was more prevalent at OVAH (57% vs 22%, P less than 0.05). Postoperative morbidity and mortality rates were 27 per cent and 14 per cent at OVAH and 25 per cent and 16 per cent at UNH. These data suggest that quality of care for surgical therapy of ulcer disease at a VA Hospital is comparable to its tertiary care affiliate with a similar patient population. 
3	Hormonal dependency of cerebral meningiomas. Part 2: In vitro effect of steroids, bromocriptine, and epidermal growth factor on growth of meningiomas. Cell culture and biochemical techniques have been employed to examine the effects of steroids, bromocriptine, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) on the growth and proliferative potential of meningiomas. In cell culture, the growth of meningiomas was not altered by progestogens, antiprogestogens, or 17beta-estradiol. The progestogen, norethisterone, had no effect on the uptake by meningiomas cell cultures of 3H-thymidine. Furthermore, cytosolic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase activity of meningiomas did not correlate with the progesterone receptor status of the same tumors. In contrast, the androgen antagonists, cyproterone acetate and 11-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, and the dopamine agonist, bromocriptine, all inhibited the in vitro growth of meningioma cells. The growth of meningioma cell cultures was stimulated by EGF, and there was a positive correlation between the EGF content and DNA polymerase activity in meningioma cytosols. These results demonstrate that female sex steroids do not influence growth of meningiomas in vitro, whereas antiandrogens and bromocriptine have an antiproliferative effect. Consequently, bromocriptine and antiandrogens may have a role in the medical treatment of meningiomas. In addition, these results suggest that EGF may be involved in the genesis and/or progression of meningiomas. 
5	Pathophysiology of ischemic skin flaps: differences in xanthine oxidase levels among rats, pigs, and humans. Oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in a variety of diseases and pathologic processes, including ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI). Based on experimental work with rat skin-flap models, the enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO) has been proposed as a major source of free radicals responsible for tissue injury and flap necrosis. The presence of this enzyme is variable within different tissues of a specific species and between species. Xanthine oxidase levels in pig and human skin have not previously been reported. The activity of xanthine oxidase in the skin of rats (N = 16), pigs (N = 7), and humans (N = 8) was measured after varying intervals of ischemia and in the rat also following reperfusion. Control pig and human skin were found to contain minimal enzyme activity, almost 40 times less than that of the rat. In the rat, xanthine oxidase activity was stable throughout a prolonged period of ischemia, and a significant decrease in activity was found after 12 hours of reperfusion (p less than 0.05). In humans, xanthine oxidase activity was unaffected by ischemia time, and in the pig, it did not increase until 24 hours of ischemia (p less than 0.05). The potential sources of free radicals and the mechanism of action of xanthine oxidase and its inhibitor allopurinol in improving flap survival in different species are reviewed. 
4	Superficial femoral artery as inflow for bypass to the proximal popliteal artery. We have obtained long term follow-up on 58 patients in whom the superficial femoral artery was used as a donor site for bypass to the proximal popliteal artery. The indication for the reconstructive procedure was intermittent claudication 36%, rest pain 34%, and gangrene 26%. All patients had angiographic evidence of a patent proximal superficial femoral artery and many had relative indications for short bypass such as limited saphenous vein availability or compromised medical condition. There was a cumulative patency rate of 79% by life table method for the series with a six year follow-up. We have observed that the superficial femoral artery is a satisfactory inflow site for proximal popliteal bypass grafts in selected patients. The procedure can maximize use of a limited segment of vein with minimal operative time and morbidity. Inflow stenosis can be revised or long bypass procedures can be offered in the event of graft failure. 
4	Plasma therapy for severe hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children in Atlantic Canada. Clinical reports have suggested that therapy with fresh frozen plasma is a useful adjunct in the management of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). We reviewed the charts of 36 children with severe HUS who were treated at the Izaac Walton Killam Hospital for Children, Halifax, over 10 years to assess the effectiveness of plasma therapy. All children who required specific supportive therapy for renal dysfunction, hemolysis or serious extrarenal complications were included. We compared the outcome of 18 children who received plasma therapy from 1982 to 1987 with that of 18 children who did not. The two groups were similar with regard to the severity of HUS, the length of hospital stay, the duration of renal dysfunction and the incidence of disease-related complications, such as seizures, enterocolitis and cardiomyopathy. At discharge the prevalence of hypertension was higher in the plasma therapy group than in the control group. Plasma therapy did not demonstrate any benefit that would outweigh the risk of fluid overload, hyperproteinemia and transmission of viral infection. 
3	Idiopathic and symptomatic trigeminal pain. The trigeminal reflexes (corneal reflex, blink reflex, masseter inhibitory periods, jaw-jerk) and far field scalp potentials (nerve, root, brainstem, subcortical) evoked by percutaneous infraorbital stimulation were recorded in 30 patients with "idiopathic" trigeminal neuralgia (ITN) and 20 with "symptomatic" trigeminal pain (STP): seven postherpetic neuralgia, five multiple sclerosis, four tumour, two vascular malformation, one Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, and one traumatic fracture. All the patients with STP and two of those with ITN had trigeminal reflex abnormalities; 80% of patients with STP and 30% of those with ITN had evoked potential abnormalities. The results indicate that 1) trigeminal reflexes and evoked potentials are both useful in the examination of patients with trigeminal pain, and in cases secondary to specific pathologies provide 100% sensitivity; 2) in "symptomatic" and "idiopathic" paroxysmal pain the primary lesion affects the afferent fibres in the proximal portion of the root or the intrinsic portion in the pons; 3) primary sensory neurons of the A-beta fibre group are involved in both paroxysmal and constant pain, but in the latter the damage is far more severe. 
1	Isolation of measles virus in primary rhesus monkey cells from a child with acute interstitial pneumonia who cytologically had giant-cell pneumonia without a rash. The isolation of measles virus in primary Rhesus monkey kidney cells (PRMK) in patients with documented giant-cell pneumonia who have presented without a rash is limited. The diagnosis usually is made by cytologic examination of nasal or bronchial secretions in which characteristic multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are observed. The diagnosis of giant-cell pneumonia has been associated with measles virus but not exclusively. Canine distemper, herpes group viruses, and parainfluenza infections have been associated with these cells. In addition, vitamin A deficiency also has been cytologically associated with multinucleated giant cells. The authors describe the isolation of measles virus from bronchial washing and sputum in PRMK cells at 4 days from an 11-year-old child with acute interstitial pneumonia who was in remission for acute lymphocytic leukemia. Classic cytopathologic effect (CPE) consisting of syncytial and hole formation on the PRMK monolayer was apparent. In addition, a foamy appearance of the monolayer was noted in an otherwise clean lot of monkey cells. Confirmatory testing with measles antibody of the infected areas of the monolayer by indirect immunofluorescence (IFA) was positive for measles antigen and negative for mumps, parainfluenza (types I, II, and III) and influenza A and B virus. Serologic studies for measles antibody revealed an IFA IgG titer of greater than 1:10,240, and an IgM titer of 1:128. Cytologic examination of the same bronchial fluid revealed the typical giant cells with characteristic inclusions associated with measles virus. Because this disease usually is severe, and often fatal, prompt recognition of this virus is essential, not only to the patient, who can be treated with immunoglobulin and/or antiviral therapy, but also to prevent the spread of the virus to other patients and medical personnel. These findings also support direct evidence for the etiologic role of measles virus in giant-cell pneumonia that has been detected either histologically or cytologically and in tissue culture at autopsy. 
2	Successful prophylaxis for fungal peritonitis in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: six years' experience [published erratum appears in Am J Kidney Dis 1991 Jun;17(6):726] Fungal peritonitis as a serious complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is often associated with severe morbidity, CAPD "drop-out" and, occasionally, death. Most episodes of fungal peritonitis occur during or after a period of antibiotic treatment of various bacterial infections, usually bacterial peritonitis. From April 1979 to December 1982 (period I), 10 episodes of fungal peritonitis occurred during 415 patient-months, ie, 10.5% of all peritonitis episodes recorded in our CAPD program. After the introduction of oral prophylaxis with 3 x 500,000 IU [corrected] nystatin during every course of antibiotic treatment, only four episodes of fungal peritonitis occurred during 2,102 patient-months, ie, 3.1% of all peritonitis episodes from January 1983 to March 1989 (period II). This difference between the first and second periods is significant (P less than 0.05). Moreover, none of the four patients who contracted fungal peritonitis in the second period received nystatin prophylaxis. Thus, the simple measure of oral prophylaxis using this nonabsorbable antifungal agent in every case of an antibiotic treatment largely eliminates the risk of fungal peritonitis in patients on CAPD. 
1	Endometrial carcinoma: a pathologic evaluation of 142 cases with and without associated endometrial hyperplasia. The association of some cases of endometrial carcinoma (EC) with hyperestrogenism is well known. The prognostic significance of concomitant endometrial hyperplasia (EH) in EC were evaluated in 142 patients with clinical stage I EC in whom lymph node assessment was carried out in 121 patients. The presence of EH was significantly associated with better differentiated tumor having lesser degrees of myometrial invasion, low segment-adnexal-lymphovascular space and pelvic/para-aortic lymph node involvement. However, the presence of EH was not significantly associated with the less virulent histologic subtypes. The possible existence of two types of EC--a hormonal-dependent EC associated with EH, and an independent EC not associated with EH--is discussed and the prognostic significance of concomitant EH stressed. 
5	Idiopathic neutropenia: antineutrophil antibodies and clinical correlations. PURPOSE: The present study was done to evaluate the clinical characteristics of a large series of adult patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia, and correlate the presence of antineutrophil antibodies, their class (IgG or IgM), and their ability to fix complement with clinical parameters, including other hemocytopenias, splenomegaly, and infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-one adult patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia were studied. Serum neutrophil-binding antibodies were measured using paraformaldehyde-fixed granulocytes (PFGs) from normal volunteers as target cells. 125I-labeled staphylococcal protein A was used to detect IgG antibodies while IgM antibodies were detected by using 125I-labeled mouse monoclonal anti-IgM antibody. Sera containing antineutrophil antibodies were tested for their ability to fix complement on donor PFGs by using 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody to the third component of complement. RESULTS: Of the 121 patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia, 71 patients had isolated neutropenia, while 50 had neutropenia combined with either anemia and/or thrombocytopenia. Among the 71 patients with isolated neutropenia, there were 51 females (72%), compared with 28 females (56%) among the 50 patients with combined hemocytopenias (p = 0.083). Patients with multiple hemocytopenias were significantly older (p less than 0.01), were more likely to demonstrate splenomegaly (p = 0.001), and may have had more infectious complications. From all the patients, 36% of sera were shown to have antineutrophil antibodies, with a non-significant trend for these to be found more frequently in patients with multiple hemocytopenias. Sera with mixed IgG-IgM antineutrophil antibodies were significantly more likely to fix complement than those with isolated IgG or IgM antibodies, and among the patients with antineutrophil antibodies, complement-fixing antibodies were significantly associated with multiple hemocytopenias. Splenomegaly was significantly associated both with antineutrophil antibodies (p = 0.008) and with infections (p = 0.007). Antineutrophil antibodies were not associated with infections. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one third of adult patients with idiopathic neutropenia have IgG and/or IgM antineutrophil antibodies demonstrable in their serum. There is a subset of patients with idiopathic neutropenia with multiple hemocytopenias who tend to be older, less likely to show female predominance, more likely to have splenomegaly and infections, and more likely to have antineutrophil antibodies, especially mixed IgG-IgM and complement-fixing antibodies. 
5	Role of epidermal growth factor, prostaglandin, and sulfhydryls in stress-induced gastric lesions. Epidermal growth factor promotes the growth of and protects gastric mucosa against various ulcerogens, including stress, but little is known about its role in the pathogenesis of stress ulcerations. In this study, Wistar rats with intact and resected salivary glands were exposed to water-immersion and restraint stress. During 2-14 hours of water-immersion restraint stress, the formation of gastric ulcerations increased progressively and the duration of stress was accompanied by a decrease in DNA synthesis in the gastric mucosa. Following sialoadenectomy, a significant increase in the number of stress ulcerations and further reduction in DNA synthesis were observed. Exogenous epidermal growth factor and dimethyl prostaglandin E2 significantly reduced the ulcerations in the stressed rats with intact salivary glands, but this reduction was significantly less pronounced after sialoadenectomy. Water-immersion restraint stress also resulted in about 50% reduction in mucosal prostaglandin E2 generation, and the pretreatment with indomethacin, which suppressed prostaglandin E2 by about 90%, almost doubled the number of stress ulcerations and abolished the gastro-protective effect of exogenous epidermal growth factor (but not dimethyl prostaglandin E2) against the stress lesions. An inhibition of ornithine decarboxylase activity by difluoromethyl ornithine also augmented stress-induced ulcerogenesis and abolished the protective action of epidermal growth factor while the administration of spermine almost completely prevented stress ulcerations in rats both without and with pretreatment with difluoromethylornithine. Water-immersion restraint stress also significantly reduced mucosal content of glutathione. Cysteamine increased tissue glutathione and reduced stress ulcerations but N-ethylmaleimide, an sulfhydryl blocker, decreased mucosal content of glutathione without affecting the stress ulcerations. This study indicates that the stress ulcers are accompanied by the reduction in mucosal synthesis of DNA, prostaglandin, and glutathione and that the presence of salivary glands attenuates the stress ulcerogenesis probably by releasing epidermal growth factor which acts, in part, by enhancing ornithine decarboxylase activity, mucosal growth, and prostaglandin and glutathione formation. 
4	Cardiac echinococcosis: the diagnostic value of computed tomography scanning. The diagnosis of cardiac hydatid disease is a difficult one. Conventional and specific cardiac investigations are not pathognomonic of this disease. In this report, the diagnostic value of computed tomography (CT) scanning was prospectively investigated in seven patients. In five patients, the diagnosis was confirmed surgically. The CT-information obtained correlated accurately to the operative findings. In all the patients, CT-densities of the lesions were measured and were found to coincide with values of mean CT-densities of hydatid cysts elsewhere in the body. The capability of measuring tissue densities is unique to CT-scanning and have been emphasized in this report. 
2	Autoantibodies in primary biliary cirrhosis: analysis of reactivity against eukaryotic and prokaryotic 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes. Six components of the mammalian 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes have previously been identified as M2 autoantigens in primary biliary cirrhosis. In this report, we present data showing that both polypeptide-specific and cross-reacting antibodies are present in patients' sera. Antibodies reacting with E2 of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex cross-react with protein X but not with any other mammalian antigen. The main immunogenic region on protein X has been localized to within its single lipoyl domain. Polypeptide-specific antibodies bind to E1 alpha and E1 beta of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Antibodies reacting with the E2 polypeptides of the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex and branched-chain 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complex show some cross-reactivity but do not recognize any of the antigens of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Antibodies against the E2 component of the mammalian pyruvate dehydrogenase complex cross-react effectively with the corresponding protein from yeast but not with E2 from Escherichia coli. Antibody titer against mammalian antigens is significantly higher than against the bacterial antigens, arguing against a bacterial origin for primary biliary cirrhosis. 
1	Transfection of C6 glioma cells with connexin 43 cDNA: analysis of expression, intercellular coupling, and cell proliferation. C6 glioma cells express low levels of the gap junction protein connexin 43 and its mRNA and display very weak dye coupling. When implanted into the rat cerebrum, these cells quickly give rise to a large glioma. To investigate the role of gap junctions in the tumor characteristics of these cells, we have used Lipofectin-mediated transfection to introduce a full-length cDNA encoding connexin 43. Several transfected clones were obtained that exhibited various amounts of connexin 43 mRNA transcribed from the inserted cDNA. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed an increase in the amount of connexin 43 immunoreactivity in the transfected cells, being localized at areas of intercellular contact as well as in the cytoplasm. The level of dye coupling was also assessed and found to correlate with the amount of connexin 43 mRNA. When cell proliferation was followed over several days, cells expressing the transfected cDNA grew more slowly than non-transfected cells. These transfected cells will be useful in examining the role of gap junctions in tumorigenesis. 
5	Extraperitoneal endarterectomy for iliofemoral occlusive disease. Sixty patients with iliofemoral occlusive disease were treated by autogenous anatomic reconstruction by endarterectomy. Endarterectomy was performed extra-peritoneally by the eversion technique. The operative technique and its advantages and disadvantages are discussed. Six patients had postoperative complications of acute anastomotic hemorrhage (two patients), would hematoma (two patients), and atelectasis (two patients). Sixty patients discharged with patient arterial reconstruction were followed up from 5 months to 17 1/2 years, with a mean follow-up of 53 months. There were no other vascular complications. Seventy limbs were at risk during this period, with an accumulative patency rate of 80.4% at 5 years and 71.4% at 10 years. There were 11 occlusions of the external iliac artery and one stenosis of the common femoral artery. Failures occurred mainly in the external iliac artery, which appears to be the limiting factor in the continued patency of endarterectomy. There were 18 deaths (30%). Nine deaths were attributed to the complications of arteriosclerosis. 
2	Small bowel obstruction associated with a leiomyomatous uterus. A case report and review of the literature. A 38-year-old woman developed small bowel obstruction shortly after a cholecystectomy because of a massively enlarged leiomyomatous uterus. Small bowel obstruction is a relatively rare complication from fibroid tumors and results from entrapment of the bowel between serosal pedunculated fibroids (as in this patient), adhesions to infarcted leiomyomas, or from compression of the small bowel by the large mass. Large uterine leiomyomas clearly must be considered in the etiology of intestinal obstruction. 
1	Soluble interleukin-2 receptors in cerebrospinal fluid from individuals with various neurological disorders. Soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2R) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were studied in infectious, inflammatory, degenerative, and neoplastic disorders to evaluate their usefulness as a marker for the presence of activated T cells, thus indicating an inflammatory process. CSF from control subjects and patients with stationary, progressive, and treated multiple sclerosis (MS); aseptic meningitis; lymphoid and nonlymphoid central nervous system (CNS) tumors; Alzheimer's disease, as well as serum from MS patients and control subjects were studied for levels of soluble IL-2R. A significant increase in CSF IL-2R levels was observed in patients with MS, meningitis, and lymphoid CNS tumors; the MS group showed the highest values. CSF from individuals with Alzheimer's disease and from patients with nonlymphoid tumors did not show significantly elevated values. Serum IL-2R levels were significantly higher in MS patients than in control subjects, but there was no significant correlation between individual serum and CSF IL-2R levels. This study suggests the presence of activated T-lymphocytes in the CNS of patients with MS. 
5	Stage transitions in B-lymphocyte differentiation correlate with limited variations in nuclear proteins. Total nuclear proteins extracted from cell lines representing various stages of differentiation of mouse B lymphocytes were studied by computer analysis of two-dimensional gels. Of the 1438 spots present on the gels, 55 varied significantly in intensity during differentiation. The variations occurred most often in steps correlating with those classically defined for B-cell differentiation. Seventeen spots were not detectable in at least one of the stages (qualitative variations) and could represent switching on or off of genes coding for nuclear proteins. Detailed analysis of the 55 variable spots showed that they fall into small sets characterized by similar expression profiles, which argues for a combinatorial, multistep control mechanism of gene expression. In addition, analysis of the expression of all the nuclear proteins resolved on the gels clearly differentiated B-lineage cells from myeloid cells and suggested that the most important transition in B-cell differentiation occurs between the resting B cell and plasmocyte stages. 
3	Acute autonomic neuropathy. Two cases and a clinical review. Acute autonomic neuropathy is an uncommon syndrome, usually affecting healthy young people. Presentation is often dramatic and initial misdiagnosis is common. We describe two young women with acute autonomic neuropathy who presented with gastrointestinal involvement heralding widespread dysautonomia and review 26 additional cases of acute autonomic neuropathy from the English language literature. Acute autonomic neuropathy can be primarily cholinergic without orthostatic hypotension (26%) or pandysautonomic (74%) involving sympathetic adrenergic functions. Onset has been temporally related to viral syndromes in 20% of cases, with autonomic deficits usually evolving over 1 to 3 weeks. Gastroparesis (69%) and syncope (12%) are frequent presenting complaints. Spinal fluid protein levels are often (75%) elevated in pandysautonomic subtypes. Prolonged and incomplete recovery is the rule (60%), with persistent gastroparesis and orthostatic hypotension. Other specific diseases that occasionally mimic acute autonomic neuropathy include botulism, porphyria, amyloidosis, and paracarcinomatous neuropathies. Acute autonomic neuropathy shares several clinical features with acute idiopathic polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome), suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis. 
4	Management of Brucella endocarditis with aortic root abscess. Three cases of Brucella endocarditis with aortic root abscess are reported. Two patients were successfully managed by a combination of medical therapy and surgery. The third patient died suddenly 36 hours after admission to hospital. 
3	Cystocerebral syndrome. Acute urinary retention presenting as confusion in elderly patients. The diagnosis of acute mental status changes in the elderly patient is often very difficult. Many causes are possible, and there is often little history obtainable. The physical examination occasionally provides the essential clues needed to discover the source of the sudden deterioration. We have recently evaluated four episodes of acute delirium in three elderly patients who presented with no readily apparent cause for these changes. On further evaluation, the patients were found to have marked bladder distention associated with acute urinary retention. None of these patients complained of discomfort, and none had any awareness or recollection of their deterioration. Each patient had rapid resolution of symptoms on bladder decompression. To our knowledge, this "cystocerebral syndrome" has not been previously described, and we suggest that it be considered in the evaluation of acute confusional states in elderly men. 
4	Clinical and anatomical considerations for surgery in aortoiliac disease and results of surgical treatment. A variety of surgical procedures are available for the treatment of occlusive disease involving the aorta and iliac arteries. Use of the most appropriate operation in each patient, determined principally by disease location and patient risk, can provide highly effective relief of disabling claudication or limb-threatening ischemia with low morbidity and mortality rates. The excellent, durable results of current surgical practice should serve as the standard with which newer treatment modalities must be compared. 
1	The rapid detection of clonal T-cell proliferations in patients with lymphoid disorders. A series of T-cell proliferations in peripheral blood, bone marrow, or tissue samples were analyzed for clonality. The technique used employs the polymerase chain reaction to amplify portions of the rearranged T-cell receptor beta chain genes, using primers recognizing conserved sequences of the variable, diversity, and joining region segments. We examined 17 cases of T-cell lymphoma or leukemia; a clone was identified in 13 cases (76%) overall and in 7 of 8 cases (87.5%) in which both beta-chain alleles were known to be rearranged, as shown by restriction enzyme analysis. No clonal rearrangements were detected in samples from 13 non-T-cell disorders, including B-cell lymphomas, reactive lymphoid proliferations, and nonlymphoid tumors. This method is useful for detecting clones in thymic and post-thymic T-cell malignancies and has the advantages of being extremely rapid (a result is obtained within hours of the biopsy procedure), requiring no radiolabeling, using only a small amount of tissue, and being applicable to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. 
5	Abnormalities of von Willebrand factor multimers in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. PURPOSE: To analyze and review von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimeric patterns in patients with single-episode thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), intermittent TTP (episodes at infrequent, irregular intervals), chronic relapsing TTP (episodes at frequent, regular intervals), and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Platelet-poor plasma samples were obtained in EDTA, citrate, or citrate-hirudin-aprotinin-leupeptin from 36 patients with single-episode TTP, eight patients with intermittent TTP, four patients with chronic relapsing TTP, and 26 patients with HUS. The samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-agarose gel electrophoresis, overlaid with rabbit 125I-anti-human vWF IgG, and analyzed by autoradiography. RESULTS: Abnormalities of vWF multimers were found in platelet-poor plasma samples from 31 of 36 found in platelet-poor plasma samples from 31 of 36 patients (86%) at the onset of and during their single TTP episode. vWF multimers larger than those in normal plasma, and similar to vWF forms observed within normal human endothelial cells (unusually large vWF multimers), were demonstrated in 31% of the patients; 19% had either unusually large vWF multimers or a relative decrease in the largest plasma vWF forms in different serial samples; 36% had a relative decrease in the largest plasma vWF forms. These results imply that endothelial cell injury or intense stimulation, along with the attachment of unusually large vWF multimers and the largest plasma vWF forms to platelets, occurred during the single TTP episodes in most patients. Patterns of vWF multimers were normal in 92% of patients with single-episode TTP studied after recovery. All eight patients with intermittent TTP and the four patients with chronic relapsing TTP had unusually large vWF multimers in their plasma between episodes, and these multimers decreased or disappeared during relapses. Of 26 children and adults with HUS, 14 had a relative decrease in the largest plasma vWF multimeric forms and one had unusually large vWF multimers during the episode (vWF multimeric abnormalities in 58% of the patients). CONCLUSION: It is probable that vWF was involved in the pathophysiology of TTP in most of these patients with the single-episode, intermittent, or chronic relapsing types of TTP, and in more than 50% of the patients with HUS. 
4	Light scattering detection of microemboli in an extracorporeal LVAD bovine model. Thromboembolization studies were performed on two calves supported by extracorporeal left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) using a light scattering (He Ne Laser) microemboli detector (LSMD). The LSMD system was placed on the outflow cannula of the LVAD in the extracorporeal loop of each animal. The measurements included the size, number, and rate of production of circulating microemboli in the range 20 microns less than microemboli diameter less than 1,000 microns. These data were compared to independently and concurrently obtained measurements of emboli shear rate (CPF), platelet count, red blood count (RBC), leukocyte count (WBC), plasma free hemoglobin, factors XIII, X, and V, and sorbitol dehydrogenase. Embolic number and volume were seen to be most dynamic in the very early phases of acute thromboembolization (0-40 minutes) with a peak embolic response within the first 30 minutes. The dynamics of reduced emboli volume, rather than number, may be implicated in the later stages of the thromboembolic passivation of these ventricles. The LSMD results generally showed an inverse correlation of microemboli volume rate with CPF measurements for each ventricle. LSMD, CPF, and leukocyte and platelet counts, showed a direct correlation with reduced counts for each additional ventricle for both calves. Factor XII was seen to have a more direct correlation in time with LSMD measurements for each ventricle than other parameters under investigation. This study represents the first time laser scattering and filtration methods have been applied simultaneously with hematologic assays in order to study the dynamics of device associated thrombogenesis. 
1	Improving diagnostic accuracy of cervical metastases with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Elective neck dissection in patients with head and neck cancer continues to be controversial. The management of these patients would be greatly facilitated by improvements in predicting cervical metastases. Recent investigations have suggested that computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are more sensitive in detecting cervical metastases than physical examination. The Department of Otolaryngology at the Ohio State University Hospitals, Columbus, undertook a prospective study to compare the preoperative sensitivities of physical examination, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging with pathologic findings in 27 patients undergoing neck dissections for head and neck cancer. The results indicate that computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were more sensitive (84% and 92%, respectively) than physical examination (75%), although the results did not achieve statistical significance. The sensitivity of combined computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging was 90%. 
5	Homeobox gene expression plus autocrine growth factor production elicits myeloid leukemia. In the murine myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3B, proviral insertions have induced expression of the Hox-2.4 homeobox gene and the gene for the myeloid growth factor interleukin 3 (IL-3). To assess their potential oncogenic role, normal bone marrow cells were infected with retroviruses bearing the genes for IL-3 or IL-3 plus Hox-2.4. Unlike the IL-3 virus, the IL-3/Hox-2.4 virus was highly leukemogenic. Infected cells expressing both genes exhibited retarded differentiation in vitro, generated myelomonocytic cell lines, and provoked a rapid, transplantable myeloid leukemia in vivo. The oncogenic action of Hox-2.4 appears to derive from its ability to impede the IL-3-driven terminal differentiation of myeloid cells. The results suggest that homeobox genes can regulate key differentiation processes such as self-renewal capacity and that their inappropriate expression can be oncogenic. 
5	Color Doppler diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic mitral regurgitation: usefulness of the flow convergence region proximal to the regurgitant orifice. In prosthetic or paravalvular prosthetic mitral regurgitation, transthoracic color Doppler flow mapping can sometimes fail to detect the regurgitant jet within the left atrium because of the shadowing by the prosthetic valve. To overcome this limitation, we assessed the utility of color Doppler visualization of the flow convergence region (FCR) proximal to the regurgitant orifice in 20 consecutive patients with mechanical prosthetic mitral regurgitation documented by surgery and cardiac catheterization (13 of 20 patients). In addition, we studied 33 patients with normally functioning mitral prostheses. Doppler studies were performed in the apical, subcostal, and parasternal long-axis views. An FCR was detected in 95% (19 of 20) of patients with prosthetic mitral regurgitation. A jet area in the left atrium was detected in 60% (12 of 20) of patients. In 18 of 19 patients with Doppler-detected FCR, the site of the leak was correctly identified by observing the location of the FCR. A trivial jet area was detected in eight patients with a normally functioning mitral prosthesis; in none was an FCR identified. Thus color Doppler visualization of the FCR proximal to the regurgitant orifice is superior to the jet area in the diagnosis of mechanical prosthetic mitral regurgitation. Moreover, FCR permits localization of the site of the leak with good accuracy. 
5	The comportmental learning disabilities of early frontal lobe damage. Two adult patients are described who suffered bilateral prefrontal damage early in life and who subsequently came to psychiatric attention because of severely aberrant behaviour. A battery of developmental psychology paradigms (not previously used to assess neurologically impaired individuals) showed that social and moral development of these 2 patients was arrested at an immature stage. In comparison with other types of brain damage which disrupt cognitive development, frontal damage acquired early in life appears to provide the neurological substrate for a special type of learning disability in the realms of insight, foresight, social judgement, empathy, and complex reasoning. 
2	Idiopathic biliary ductopenia in adults: a report of five cases. The clinical and pathological findings of five adult cases of idiopathic nonsyndromatic paucity of interlobular bile ducts are reported. Patients were 18-32 years old at the onset of the disease; four presented with pruritus and/or jaundice and one with bleeding of the esophageal varices. Two patients were siblings. Serum alkaline phosphatase counts ranged from 1 to 16 times the upper normal value, and total bilirubin counts ranged from 0.6 to 8.8 mg/dL (10 to 150 mumol/L). Initial liver biopsy showed portal and periportal fibrosis with cholangiolar proliferation and reduction in the number of interlobular bile ducts. Antimitochondrial antibodies were absent, and bile ducts were normal after opacification. The patients were observed for 3-11 years. Repeated liver biopsies in the five patients showed progression of the lesions, with development of biliary type cirrhosis in four. Two of the four patients with cirrhosis died of hepatic failure 3 and 11 years after onset of the disease. In the two other cases, liver transplantation was performed successfully. These cases suggest that chronic cholestasis with marked ductopenia resembling the nonsyndromatic paucity described in infancy and childhood may reveal itself at an adult age. This disorder, possibly familial, may rapidly progress to severe and even fatal liver disease and could be a new indication for liver transplantation. 
3	The distribution of cerebral muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in vivo in patients with dementia. A controlled study with 123IQNB and single photon emission computed tomography. A high-affinity muscarinic receptor antagonist, 123IQNB (3-quinuclidinyl-4-iodobenzilate labeled with iodine 123), was used with single photon emission computed tomography to image muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in 14 patients with dementia and in 11 healthy controls. High-resolution single photon emission computed tomographic scanning was performed 21 hours after the intravenous administration of approximately 5 mCi of IQNB. In normal subjects, the images of retained ligand showed a consistent regional pattern that correlated with postmortem studies of the relative distribution of muscarinic receptors in the normal human brain, having high radioactivity counts in the basal ganglia, occipital cortex, and insular cortex, low counts in the thalamus, and virtually no counts in the cerebellum. Eight of 12 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease had obvious focal cortical defects in either frontal or posterior temporal cortex. Both patients with a clinical diagnosis of Pick's disease had obvious frontal and anterior temporal defects. A region of interest statistical analysis of relative regional activity revealed a significant reduction bilaterally in the posterior temporal cortex of the patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. This study demonstrates the practicability of acetylcholine receptor imaging with 123IQNB and single photon emission computed tomography. The data suggest that focal abnormalities in muscarinic binding in vivo may characterize some patients with Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease, but further studies are needed to address questions about partial volume artifacts and receptor quantification. 
5	Spontaneous rupture of the spleen in initial presentation of Hodgkin's disease. A 46-year-old man presented with a four-week history of fevers, occasional chills, and a two-week history of sweats and poor appetite. He also complained of progressive weakness and lethargy. After initial evaluation, while awaiting further consultation, the patient developed rapidly progressing abdominal pain and light-headedness. He was moved immediately into the emergency treatment area. He was noted to have an acute abdomen and was taken to surgery. An enlarged Hodgkin's-infiltrated spleen with an actively bleeding hematoma was removed. The patient denied any history of trauma. 
3	Measurement and treatment in cerebral palsy: an argument for a new approach. This article describes the need for a shift in our therapeutic strategies for patients with cerebral palsy. Changes in functional abilities must be stressed in therapy. Coincident with this emphasis must be the development of functional assessments to be used when documenting intervention outcomes. Research on functional arm movement using kinematic analysis is described for this patient group. 
4	Plaque morphology and pathologic changes in arteries from patients dying after coronary balloon angioplasty Morphologic correlates of pathologic success or failure were studied at autopsy in 28 patients with 40 coronary arteries that had been subjected to balloon angioplasty. The presence of the following histologic features was evaluated: plaque concentricity or eccentricity, calcification, fibrous or fibropultaceous plaque, medial disruption, luminal thrombus and inflammation. Angioplasty was considered successful (residual cross-sectional luminal area greater than 25%) on pathologic examination in 14 arteries and unsuccessful in 26 arteries. Eccentric plaques were more likely to be successfully dilated than were concentric lesions (p less than 0.05). Six (50%) of 12 fibropultaceous plaques were successfully dilated compared with only 8 (29%) of 28 fibrous plaques. Moderate to severe calcification did not preclude morphologic success. Medial stretching or dissection, or both, was more often associated with a successful result. Thus, plaque morphology may be an important determinant of pathologic outcome after coronary angioplasty. 
4	Balloon valvuloplasty for fungal endocarditis induced stenosis of a bioprosthetic tricuspid valve. Palliative treatment was provided without complications by double balloon valvuloplasty of a stenotic porcine tricuspid valve in a patient with fungal endocarditis. With two 15 mm diameter valvulotomy balloons the peak tricuspid gradient decreased from 21 to 7 mm Hg and valve area increased from 0.3 to 1.2 cm2. After the procedure the patient clinically improved; however, valve replacement was not performed as planned because the patient developed an intracranial hemorrhage. She subsequently died of complications of fungemia. The present report demonstrates the possible use of valvuloplasty as a palliative procedure in selected patients with valvular stenosis involved with endocarditis. 
1	Cavernous hemangioma of the spinal cord: report of 2 unusual cases. We present 2 cases of spinal cord intramedullary cavernous hemangioma; 1 patient is the 1st reported case of multiple spinal cord lesions. Diagnosis is greatly enhanced by the use of MRI. 
5	High-output left ventricular failure after dextran use in an operative hysteroscopy. High-output left ventricular failure occurred in a patient after a difficult case of hysteroscopic lysis of adhesions using dextran as a distension medium. The excessive dissection in the uterine wall, the long duration of the operation, and the large volumes of dextran probably caused intravasation of dextran into the systemic circulation inducing a significant shift of fluids from the third space. This was possibly assisted by the large volume of fluids given intravenously in a 45-kg patient initiating the reported sequence of events. 
1	Primary malignant melanoma in the parotid gland. Reports of primary malignant melanoma arising from the parotid salivary gland are extremely rare and, to date, have been sporadic. We report a pertinent case, and tabulate and correlate the clinical findings of the 13 cases reported thus far in the literature. The most common symptom is a progressively enlarging, asymptomatic, firm, and fixed mass. Total excision has been the established treatment of choice. The contribution of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy remains unclear, and it is not possible at present to predict the outcome of treatment in individual patients. Although rare, primary malignant melanoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of parotid tumors. The clinical significance of establishing the diagnosis of primary malignant melanoma of the parotid gland is emphasized. 
4	Effects of the phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine on injury in ischemic and metabolically inhibited adult isolated myocytes. The phospholipase inhibitor mepacrine has been shown to delay cell death of metabolically inhibited cultured cardiomyocytes. The present study was initiated to determine if mepacrine also delays cell death and development of osmotic fragility of both metabolically inhibited and ischemic adult rat cardiomyocytes. Isolated myocyte suspensions were incubated with 3 mmol/l (millimolar) iodoacetic acid and 6 mmol/l amytal (inhibited) or were pelleted into a slurry and layered with oil (ischemic) in the presence and absence of 10 or 50 mumol/l (micromolar) mepacrine. Rates of contracture, cell viability as determined by trypan blue permeability, cell viability after osmotic swelling in 170 mOsm media (osmotic fragility), and cell morphology were monitored. Mepacrine had no effects on rates of contracture, but was found to significantly delay cell death during isotonic incubations of both metabolically inhibited and ischemic cells. In contrast, mepacrine had no effect on the development of osmotic fragility. Incubation of metabolically inhibited myocytes in calcium-free media did not delay contracture or cell injury, but did attenuate the protective effects of mepacrine. This study confirms previous reports that mepacrine protects cells from injury, extends the observations of protection to ischemic isolated adult myocytes, but shows that development of osmotic fragility is not inhibited by mepacrine. 
1	A new method for mapping hepatic subsegment: counterstaining identification technique. Hepatic subsegmentectomy requires identification of the borders of tumor-bearing subsegment, usually achieved by injecting dye into the portal veins feeding the domain. We describe an alternative technique for performing systematic subsegmentectomy in patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, in whom hepatic arterial and portal venous embolizations were already performed as a preoperative adjuvant. Under ultrasonic guidance, each of the neighboring portal units is sequentially stained, thus defining the avascular subsegment to be resected as the nonstaining area. This allows the subsegment to be totally resected. This counterstaining identification technique can be used for all subsegments undergoing complete embolization and for other situations in which the usual staining method is impossible because of the presence of arterioportal shunting or portal tumor thrombus. 
5	The somatic patient. A significant proportion of patients seen in the Emergency Department will present with somatic complaints for which there is no apparent physiologic cause. Such patients may be divided into two broad categories: (1) those with symptoms and signs consciously synthesized by the patient, either for obvious secondary gain (malingering) or as a result of more subtle and complex motivations (factitious disorders); and (2) those patients with symptoms that are the unconscious expression of psychological stress (somatoform disorders). The somatoform disorders include (1) somatization disorder (characterized by a chronic history of numerous and widely divergent somatic complaints), (2) psychogenic pain disorder (somatization expressed in terms of persistent pain), (3) hypochondriasis (a conviction that one is diseased and disabled in conjunction with a well-focused constellation of supporting symptoms), and (4) conversion disorder (a single, usually nonpainful neurologic symptom, often with identifiable coping value for the patient). The first three disorders have been aggregately termed the "common somatization syndrome." Management of the somatically focused patient includes the communication of a caring attitude to the patient in conjunction with a cautious and diligent search for treatable medical or psychiatric illness. Resocialization and development of patient links with ongoing, nurturing nonmedical as well as medical support systems is of benefit. 
5	Proximal femoral allografts in revision hip arthroplasty. We followed prospectively 69 patients with 78 proximal femoral allografts performed for revision of total hip arthroplasty for an average of 36 months (range 29 to 68). Large fragment proximal femoral allografts and cortical strut allografts were successful in 85%. Grafts smaller than 3 cm in length (calcar grafts) were clinically successful in 81%, but 50% underwent significant radiographic resorption. We conclude that large proximal femoral allografts and cortical strut allografts provide dependable reconstruction of bone stock deficiencies during revision total hip arthroplasty. 
5	High risk of recurrent stroke after discontinuance of five to twelve years of transfusion therapy in patients with sickle cell disease. Although long-term transfusion therapy is at least 90% effective in preventing recurrent strokes after an initial cerebrovascular accident in patients with sickle cell disease, it is unknown how long transfusion therapy should be continued. To address this question, we prospectively discontinued transfusions in 10 patients with sickle cell disease whose median duration of transfusion therapy after an initial stroke was 9 1/2 years (range 5 to 12 years). Before the transfusions were discontinued, patients were examined by cerebral angiography, magnetic resonance imaging of the head, neuropsychologic testing, electroencephalography, and a complete neurologic examination. Within 12 months after transfusion therapy was stopped, 5 of 10 patients had had an ischemic event. Three events caused relatively mild deficits in the same areas as those originally affected. Two were associated with massive intracranial hemorrhage, including one on the contralateral side of original involvement. An additional patient died suddenly of unknown causes. Of the four remaining patients, three declined to resume transfusion and are relatively well at greater than or equal to 18 months after therapy was stopped. The studies performed before transfusions were stopped were not predictive of recurrent stroke. The risk of recurrent cerebrovascular accident in this group was significantly greater than the estimated risk of 10% in patients who are receiving long-term transfusion therapy (p = 0.002). This adverse outcome suggests that patients with sickle cell disease who have had a stroke must receive long-term transfusion indefinitely or a suitable therapeutic alternative must be devised. 
1	Congenital cyst of common bile duct: an unusual cause of obstructive jaundice. Congenital cysts, sometimes referred to as nonparasitic biliary cysts, are not unusual findings in the liver parenchyma, but they have not been previously described in the common bile duct. This clinical report describes a 41-year-old woman with obstructive jaundice that was caused by congenital cysts. The patient had obstruction of the middle portion of the common bile duct; therefore the major differential diagnostic considerations were cholangiocarcinoma, cancer of the pancreas, or true biliary cysts. Congenital cysts, retention cysts, and neoplastic cysts cannot be differentiated from other true cysts preoperatively. Diagnosis can only be established by microscopic examination after surgical excision. 
5	Mesenteric blood flow in patients with diabetic neuropathy. We examined flow velocities in the superior mesenteric artery and celiac artery in normal controls (group C, n = 11), diabetic patients (group D, n = 8), and diabetic patients with clinically evident autonomic neuropathy (group DN, n = 6) to further define the usefulness of duplex examination in the evaluation of the mesenteric circulation in normal and disease states. By use of a 3 MHz duplex scanner, peak systolic velocity, peak diastolic forward velocity, end-diastolic forward velocity, and peak diastolic reverse velocity were measured in centimeters per second before and after a standardized meal. The vessels' diameters in centimeters were also measured. After the meal peak diastolic reverse velocity disappeared in all patients. The average vessel diameter in the superior mesenteric artery (0.7 cm) and celiac artery (0.8 cm) did not change. Flow velocities in the celiac artery were not significantly altered by the meal. In the control group, peak systolic velocity in the superior mesenteric artery increased 38%, peak diastolic forward velocity rose 66%, and end-diastolic forward velocity increased by 70%. In the diabetic nonneuropathic group the changes were 15%, 98%, and 100%, respectively. These changes were statistically significant (p less than 0.01). On the other hand, the patients with diabetic autonomic neuropathy presenting a picture of gastroparesis did not exhibit the expected increases in postprandial velocities. Moreover, this alteration in blood flow velocity, although similar to that encountered in patients with intestinal angina, did not appear to be due to occlusive arterial disease on the basis of clinical examination and B-mode scanning. 
5	Prevalence and severity of the premenstrual syndrome. Effects of foods and beverages that are sweet or high in sugar content. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether certain foods and beverages that are high in sugar content or taste sweet are related to the prevalence and severity of the premenstrual syndrome. Specifically, we sought to evaluate whether consumption of "junk foods", chocolate, caffeine-free cola, fruit juices or alcoholic beverages might exert an effect on the premenstrual syndrome apart from any effects of daily consumption of beverages that are high in caffeine (caffeine-containing coffee, tea and colas). The study was based on 853 responses to a questionnaire probing menstrual and premenstrual health and certain daily dietary practices; it was mailed to female university students in Oregon. An analysis of the data revealed that the consumption of chocolate, but not of other junk foods, was related to the prevalence of the premenstrual syndrome among women with more severe premenstrual symptoms. Likewise, the consumption of alcoholic beverages (all alcoholic beverages and beer only) was related to the prevalence of the premenstrual syndrome among women with more severe symptoms, as were both fruit juice and caffeine-free soda. None of the associations was substantially altered when the daily consumption of beverages high in caffeine content was controlled for. Taken together, these data suggest that the consumption of foods and beverages that are high in sugar content or taste sweet is associated with prevalence of the premenstrual syndrome. 
4	Preliminary results of the Norwegian doxazosin postmarketing surveillance study: a twelve-week experience. The study was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of doxazosin in the control of blood pressure in general medical practice; the results presented concern the first 748 patients evaluated over a 12-week period. Blood pressure was significantly reduced after treatment with doxazosin (-13/-9 mm Hg), and heart rate was not significantly altered. In addition, doxazosin significantly reduced total cholesterol levels (-6.7%), reduced triglyceride levels (-19.8%), increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (+2.5%), and the high-density lipoprotein:total cholesterol ratio (+9.7%). The calculated risk of coronary heart disease was reduced by 20.5% over a 12-week period. Thirty-five percent of patients reported at least one side effect, and the number of patients experiencing severe adverse reactions was small. Twenty patients (2.7%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events, and 2.7% had the dose of doxazosin reduced. 
5	Arteriovenous malformation of the tongue. Polyvinyl alcohol particles used to embolize an arteriovenous malformation of the tongue were only temporarily successful. Additional embolization therapy was necessary and was complicated by ischemic ulcers of the tongue. We conclude that embolization therapy can be used, but the efficacy of this therapy in the longer term remains to be determined. 
3	Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation as a probe in elderly subjects. The effects of a 2-night rapid eye movement (REM) sleep deprivation (RSD) procedure on electroencephalographic sleep and mood were examined in 15 healthy elderly control subjects, 14 elderly patients with endogenous depression, and 15 patients with primary degenerative dementia. Compared with control subjects, both patient groups maintained a higher amount of REM sleep time and REM activity during RSD. Unexpectedly, depressed patients showed little rebound in visually scored or automated REM sleep measures following RSD, and they showed stability of REM activity temporal distribution from baseline to recovery conditions. This contrasted with the rebound in REM sleep activity seen in control subjects, and the more modest increase in demented patients. The RSD was fairly specific, with some impact on delta sleep during the procedure but not during recovery sleep. Mood ratings were unaffected by RSD. These findings demonstrated a greater plasticity of REM sleep regulation in the healthy elderly control subjects and suggested a higher REM "pressure" with a "ceiling effect" in depressed patients. Patients with dementia appeared to have an impaired capacity to respond to the challenge of RSD. 
5	Delayed pharyngoesophageal perforation: a complication of anterior spine surgery. Stabilization of the cervical spine is often accomplished via an anterior cervical approach. Bone grafts and/or plates and screws are used to achieve stabilization. Injuries to the pharynx and esophagus are known complications in anterior exposure of the cervical spine. These injuries are manifest in the early postoperative period. Reports of late perforations are very rare. We present four cases of delayed injury to the pharynx and esophagus that resulted in abscess or fistula. We postulate that graft displacement with resulting erosion was responsible for these serious complications. Postoperative odynophagia in patients who undergo anterior cervical fusion warrants evaluation of the bone graft location. Early surgical intervention and repair may decrease prolonged morbidity in these patients. 
3	Short stature, mental retardation, and hypoparathyroidism: a new syndrome. Eight children (four boys and four girls) with extreme failure to thrive, dysmorphic features, developmental delay, hypoparathyroidism, and abnormal skeletal survey were studied. They were the products of seven consanguinous marriages, two of the patients being brothers. In the remaining six families, a further four children had affected siblings who had died in infancy. When assessed the children were aged 0.47-12.8 years; SD scores were less than -2 for height, weight, and head circumference in all patients. The children had identical facies with deep set eyes, depressed nasal bridge with beaked nose, long philtrum, thin upper lip, micrognathia, and large floppy earlobes. They were all developmentally retarded. The following abnormalities were found on investigation: hypocalcaemia in all (of whom six of seven had hypoparathyroidism), medullary stenosis and other skeletal survey defects in seven of the eight children, and reduced numbers of T cell subsets in four of four tested. We believe that these children represent a new, as yet undescribed genetically determined syndrome. 
3	Pain on common bile duct injection during ERCP: does it indicate sphincter of Oddi dysfunction? The reproduction of a patient's biliary-type pain upon initial injection of contrast material into the common bile duct during diagnostic ERCP is a dramatic experience for both patient and physician. The significance of this phenomenon is not clear, but it is touted by some to be a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. Sphincter of Oddi manometry was performed on 224 consecutive patients referred over a 2-year period for evaluation of post-cholecystectomy syndrome and suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. All patients received only intravenous diazepam as premedication for ERCP. Delayed drainage time (greater than 45 min), bile duct dilation (greater than or equal to 12 mm), and a basal sphincter of Oddi pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg (mean +/- 3 SD) were considered elevated. We observed a reproduction of pain in 15 of 224 patients (6.7%) immediately following contrast injection. There was no correlation between pain on contrast injection and elevated basal sphincter of Oddi pressure, delayed common bile duct drainage, bile duct dilation, or abnormal liver enzymes. Therefore, we feel that reproduction of the patient's biliary-type pain associated with contrast injection of ERCP is not a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction. 
4	Venous ulcers: pathophysiology and medical therapy. Venous ulcers may occur as a result of lower extremity calf pump failure, with ensuing edema, trapping of white blood cells and deposition of pericapillary fibrin. Acute, smaller lesions are easily treated with adequate compression and occlusive dressings. Larger, more chronic wounds often benefit from some form of external compression. Occlusive dressings and local wound care are most effective when used simultaneously with compression. Sequential compression pumps merit study and may prove to be of therapeutic and prophylactic value. In refractory cases, long-term use of compression devices may be required to prevent ulcer recurrence. 
5	Plasma exchange in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis: a long-term study. Plasma exchange (PE) was shown in a previous double-blind randomized controlled study to confer significant additional benefit at 1 year upon patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis (CPMS) treated with immunosuppressive drug therapy (ISDT). Efficacy over an extended term, indications for retreatment, and long-term toxicity are dealt with in this analysis of a larger number of patients. During the past 7 years, 200 patients with CPMS have been treated with PE and low-dose ISDT at this center. Improvement on the Kurtzke Disability Status Scale by one or more steps post-therapy and at 3-year follow-up is significant by comparison with pre-PE disability status. Clinical improvement was maintained in the majority of patients, reaching as far as a 6-year follow-up. Major life-threatening complications attributable to this combined therapy were not observed. 
4	Diagnostic value of DNA analysis in effusions by flow cytometry and image analysis. A prospective study on 102 patients as compared with cytologic examination One hundred twenty-six effusion samples from 102 patients were examined by cytology and flow cytometry (FCM). Overall, there was an 84% correlation between cytologic and FCM results. Of the 36 malignant cases determined by cytologic examination, FCM revealed an aneuploid peak in 20 (56%). Image analysis (IA) performed on the malignant cytologic cases with a diploid flow pattern detected two additional aneuploid peaks. In addition, FCM indicated three aneuploid cases in which cytologic characteristics were initially interpreted as benign (false negative). Aneuploidy was therefore detected in 64% of the malignant effusion specimens by FCM and IA. Twenty-three of the total of 24 aneuploid cases detected by FCM were associated with malignancy (predictive value = 96%). The one nonmalignant case was that of hemorrhagic pancreatitis with infected pseudocyst. FCM is an excellent tool when moderate to large numbers of tumor cells are present, whereas use of IA is advantageous for specimens containing smaller numbers of malignant cells because these can be directly analyzed. When an aneuploid peak is present, a diagnosis of malignancy must be suspected, and, if the initial cytologic screen is negative, a critical review of the cytology slides is justified. In those cases with an equivocal atypical cytology report and an abnormal cytometric histogram, additional investigation is warranted. In some malignancies the tumor cells will be diploid (in this study 36%) and neither FCM nor IA will add to tumor detection, leaving cytologic examination as the definitive technique. 
5	Bacteriologic findings with ectopic pregnancy. The fallopian tubes and peritoneum of 27 patients were cultured at the time of salpingotomy/salpingectomy to determine if active tubal infection was the cause of post-operative temperature elevations. Infection was documented in six patients (22%). Previous exposure to Chlamydia trachomatis was documented with 2 endocervical cultures and 17 serum specimens positive for IgG antibody. The culture results, however, did not correlate with the postoperative febrile morbidity. 
5	Cervical spine stabilization. A three-dimensional, biomechanical evaluation of rotational stability, strength, and failure mechanisms. The three-dimensional rotational biomechanical properties of several different types of posterior stabilizing procedures are reported. A severe ligamentous and bony injury was simulated with three vertebral body human cervical spine segments. Good stabilization was noted for all of the repairs in flexion loading. Without polymethylmethacrylate supplementation, none of the repairs was stable in extension. All of the repairs provided reasonable stabilization for lateral bending except for the posterior wiring without methacrylate, and all but the posterior wiring and facet fusion provided reasonable stabilization against axial rotation loading. The supplementation of all of these repairs with polymethylmethacrylate added considerably to the stability of all the constraints. These findings may be useful in clinical decision-making for determining the kind of repairs and postoperative brace protection to use. 
2	Congenital dilatation of the bile duct in 100 instances and its relationship with anomalous junction [published erratum appears in Surg Gynecol Obstet 1991 Mar;172(3):246] Congenital dilatation of the bile duct (CDBD) or choledochal cyst has been demonstrated to be associated with an anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary ductal system. Multifarious clinical signs and symptoms of CDBD have been shown to be closely related with the presence of this anomalous junction. In the present study, 100 instances of CDBD treated surgically at our institutions during a 30 year period were classified into two types according to the morphologic features of dilatation of the bile duct; there were 77 instances of the cystic type and 23 of the cylindric type. Morphologic features of the lesion, clinical signs and symptoms and laboratory findings in these 100 instances were clinically analyzed. In almost all of the patients who were less than one year of age, the disease was of the cystic type and patients presented with either a palpable mass or jaundice as the main symptom. In patients more than one year of age, the disease was of either the cystic or cylindric type. A history of episodes of characteristic abdominal pain accompanied by elevated levels of serum amylase was present in 70 of the patients with the cystic type of disease and in all of the patients with the cylindric type. Histologic sections from the patients showed glandular formation with chronic inflammation, possibly a result of refluxed activated pancreatic juice; in contrast, histologic sections from the remaining patients of all ages showed only thickening of the fibrous layer. Thus, such variable morphologic features and clinical signs and symptoms in CDBD are highly dependent on two factors--the age at onset and the reflux of pancreatic juice into the bile duct through the common channel. 
5	The role of fistulography in fistula-in-ano. Report of five cases. A retrospective review of 27 patients undergoing anal fistulography is presented. The etiology of the 27 fistulas studied are as follows: cryptoglandular infection in 18, IBD in 7 (Crohn's 6, CUC 1), iatrogenic in 1, and foreign body perforation in 1. Twenty-six fistulograms revealed either direct communication with the anus or rectum, or abscess cavities/tracts, or both. Two fistulograms revealed no radiographic evidence of fistula (one patient had two fistulograms). In 13 of the 27 patients (48 percent) information obtained from the fistulograms revealed either unexpected pathology (n = 7) or directly altered surgical management (n = 6). We conclude that anal fistulography in properly selected patients may add useful information for the definitive management of fistula-in-ano. 
3	Neuropsychological aspects of learning disabilities in epilepsy. Cognitive impairment is regarded as the link between epileptic conditions and the inability to learn in school. The neuropsychological approach to learning disabilities in epilepsy, therefore, first concentrates on analyzing the differential effects of epileptic factors on cognitive function. The impact of seizure activity, localization of epileptogenic foci, and antiepileptic treatment on cognitive functioning can be evaluated based upon the results of continuous assessment with a computerized neuropsychological test system. Second, learning disabilities may be evaluated on observations made during classroom performance. Three issues seem to predominate in learning studies among disabled children with epilepsy: test-retest variability, deterioration, and the supposed specificity of the learning disabilities. 
1	Skull base malignancy following long-term sinus mucocele and osteomyelitis. A case of skull base malignancy following long-term sinus mucocele is presented. While the similarity in clinical signs between sinus mucocele and malignancy has recently been emphasized in the literature, no previous case of skull base malignancy following frontoethmoid mucocele has been reported. The literature is reviewed and the association between inflammatory conditions and sinus malignancy is outlined. 
5	Successful control of bleeding from gastric antral vascular ectasia (watermelon stomach) by laser photocoagulation. We report a case of gastric antral vascular ectasia in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis in whom chronic blood loss was a major problem. She required repeated blood transfusions that were complicated by reactions and still had persistent anaemia. She was treated with laser phototherapy in the form of quadrantic photocoagulation with a neodynium yttrium-aluminium-garnet laser. This greatly improved the endoscopic appearance of the gastric lesions and effectively controlled blood loss. She required no further transfusions. Bleeding recurred after 11 months which was controlled by further laser photocoagulation. 
4	Replacement of an aortic valve cusp after neonatal endocarditis. Septic arthritis developed in a neonate after an infection of her hand. Despite medical and surgical treatment endocarditis of her aortic valve developed and the resultant regurgitation required emergency surgery. At operation a new valve cusp was fashioned from preserved calf pericardium. Nine years later she was well and had full exercise tolerance with minimal aortic regurgitation. 
4	Temporal relationship between the decrease in arterial pressure and sodium retention in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis. It has been proposed that the initial event of sodium retention in cirrhosis is a peripheral arteriolar vasodilation causing underfilling of the arterial vascular compartment and stimulation of the renin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. To test this hypothesis, systolic blood pressure, sodium balance and urinary excretion of sodium and aldosterone were sequentially measured in 13 conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats submitted to a cirrhosis induction program with carbon tetrachloride and phenobarbital and in 14 control hypertensive animals. No significant differences were found between control and cirrhotic rats in any of the measured parameters during the first 7 wk of the study. The eighth week sodium retention developed in cirrhotic rats as indicated by a positive sodium balance and a marked decrease of sodium excretion. At the same time a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure and a great increase in urinary excretion of aldosterone were detected. These changes were more marked the ninth week of the study. In cirrhotic rats there was a highly significant direct correlation between systolic blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion. Postmortem examination showed a histological picture of cirrhosis in all animals given carbon tetrachloride and ascites in six of them. These results indicate that the onset of hyperaldosteronism and sodium retention in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis is chronologically related to a significant decrease in arterial pressure, thus supporting the "peripheral arterial vasodilation hypothesis" of ascites. 
5	Radiographic identification by mastoid sinus and arterial pattern. A skull and some incomplete postcranial remains were discovered in two searches over a two-month period near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The discoveries could be demonstrated to be from the same person, and the remains were shown to be consistent with a specific missing person on the basis of anthropological analysis. Further work led to a positive identification on multiple grounds, including agreement of the details of the mastoid sinus and endocranial arterial patterns observed radiographically. These features may be useful for establishing positive identification from skeletal remains when antemortem radiographic studies for comparison are limited to lateral cranial vault studies. 
5	Bowel dysfunction in fibromyalgia syndrome. Fibromyalgia and irritable bowel syndrome frequently coexist. In this study, we utilized a previously validated self-administered questionnaire to assess the prevalence of symptoms of bowel dysfunction and irritable bowel syndrome in 123 patients with fibromyalgia as compared to 54 patients with degenerative joint disease (DJD) and 46 normal controls. Ninety (73%) of the fibromyalgia patients reported altered bowel function as compared to 20 (37%) DJD patients and none of the normal controls (P less than 0.001). Ninety-nine patients (81%) reported normal alternating with irregular bowel pattern, and 77 (63%) had alternating diarrhea and constipation. In contrast, only 24 (44%) of DJD patients and six (13%) of controls had regular alternating with irregular bowel pattern and only 12 (22%) of the DJD patients and none of the healthy controls had alternating constipation and diarrhea (P less than 0.01). Other bowel dysfunction complaints noted in the fibromyalgia group were abdominal gas (59%), nausea (21%), diarrhea (9%), and constipation (12%). Seventy-nine (64%) fibromyalgia patients reported frequent abdominal pain that was stress-related 47% of the time. Laxative use was frequent in the fibromyalgia group (19%) and absent in the other two groups. Fifty percent of fibromyalgia patients, compared to 28% of DJD patients, felt that their bowel complaints were worse during exacerbations of their joint disease (P less than 0.05). In conclusion, patients with fibromyalgia have a high prevalence of gastrointestinal complaints that should be carefully assessed. If the diagnosis of IBS is confirmed, appropriate treatment may improve patients' symptoms, although this approach requires further study. 
1	Evaluating cervical cone biopsy specimens with frozen sections at hysterectomy. Frozen section evaluations of cervical cone biopsy specimens were performed at the time of hysterectomy to exclude invasive cervical cancer. During a two-year period we prospectively evaluated 43 cone biopsy specimens. We found all the diagnoses made with frozen sections to be accurate when compared with prospective permanent sections, and all patients received appropriate therapy. Thirty-eight cases showed no evidence of invasion. Two patients had invasive squamous cell cervical cancer, one had invasive cervical adenocarcinoma extending to the endometrial cavity, and two had microinvasion. All invasive cancers were diagnosed correctly with frozen sections and confirmed with permanent sections. When hysterectomy immediately followed conization, no complications occurred, and no significant increase in blood loss was noted. We found frozen section evaluation of a cone biopsy specimen at the time of hysterectomy to be a reliable procedure that saves time, eliminates the risk of additional anesthesia and decreases patients' costs. 
1	Late deaths after treatment for childhood cancer. An investigation of 749 deaths occurring among 4082 patients surviving at least five years after the diagnosis of childhood cancer in Britain before 1971 has been undertaken. Of the 738 with sufficient information the numbers of deaths attributable to the following causes were: recurrent tumour, 550 (74%), a second primary tumour, 61 (8%), a medical condition related to treatment of the tumour, 49 (7%), an traumatic death unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 34 (5%), finally, any other cause unrelated to the tumour or its treatment, 44 (6%). Less than 10% of five year survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphomas, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilms' tumour, or a soft tissue sarcoma died of recurrent tumour during the next 15 years, while more than 25% of five year survivors of Hodgkin's disease, ependymoma, medulloblastoma, and Ewing's tumour died of recurrent tumour during the corresponding period. Almost 50% of five year survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia died of recurrent disease during the corresponding 15 years, a large proportion of deaths being due to central nervous system relapse in an era before central nervous system prophylaxis was routinely given. Comparison of the mortality observed with that expected from mortality rates in the general population indicated three times the expected number of deaths from non-neoplastic causes. Five times the expected number of deaths from cardiovascular causes were observed, these were predominantly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. There was no evidence of an excess in the number of suicides observed, but there were three times the expected number of deaths from accidents observed after central nervous system tumours. 
1	Resection of the primary liver cancer of the hepatic hilus. Primary liver cancer (PLC) of the hepatic hilus was designated as a tumor situated at the main branch of the portal vein or pedicle of the hepatic veins in contact with the intrahepatic vena cava. That is, the main tumor located at segment I, IV, V, or VIII and concentrating on the central part of the liver was called "the central type of PLC," which differed from a tumor located at segment II, III, VI, or VII; the latter was called "the peripheral type of PLC." Surgical treatment of the PLC has been significantly improved in the past two decades, but the resection of the central type of PLC is difficult and hazardous. This institution admitted 903 PLC from January 1970 to April 1988, of which 118 cases were the central type; 65 cases were resected successfully, a resectability of 55.1%. One patient died from sepsis within 1 month of operation (mortality 1.53%). The modes of operation for the different segments are described, and suggestions for improvements are presented. The survival rates were compared with a similar number of patients with the peripheral type of tumor in the same period and treated by the same surgeons. The results show noticeable differences. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after resection were 70.9%, 43.2%, and 39.2% in the central type of PLC; they were 98.3%, 85.0%, and 76.4% in the peripheral type of PLC (P less than 0.001). Further discussion of improvements in surgical techniques and mental awareness are suggested. 
2	Syncytial giant-cell hepatitis. Sporadic hepatitis with distinctive pathological features, a severe clinical course, and paramyxoviral features. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. We describe a new form of hepatitis, occurring in 10 patients over a period of six years, characterized clinically by manifestations of severe hepatitis, histologically by large syncytial giant hepatocytes, and ultrastructurally by intracytoplasmic structures consistent with paramyxoviral nucleocapsids. RESULTS. The patients ranged in age from 5 months to 41 years. The tentative clinical diagnosis before biopsy was non-A, non-B hepatitis in five patients and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in the others. Five patients underwent liver transplantation; the others died. The diagnosis of syncytial giant-cell hepatitis was established pathologically. The liver cords were replaced in all 10 patients by syncytial giant cells with up to 30 nuclei. In 8 of the 10 the cytoplasm contained pleomorphic particles of 150 to 250 microns, filamentous strands, and particles of 14 to 17 nm with peripherally disposed spikes resembling paramyxoviral nucleocapsids. Structures resembling degenerated forms were found in the other two patients. One of two chimpanzees injected with a liver homogenate from the index patient had an increase in the titer of paramyxoviral antibodies, probably an anamnestic reaction to previous paramyxoviral infection, suggesting that a paramyxoviral antigen but not viable virus was present in the liver homogenate. CONCLUSIONS. Although further virologic studies will be required for precise classification, we believe that paramyxoviruses should be considered in patients with severe sporadic hepatitis. 
5	Captopril-induced cholestatic jaundice. I have reported a case of captopril-induced cholestatic jaundice. This drug is being used with increasing frequency, so it is important that physicians recognize this adverse effect. Captopril-induced jaundice resolves after cessation of captopril therapy. 
5	Surgical experience with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can present as lobar intracerebral hemorrhage in an elderly person, presumably due to increased fragility of the vessels affected by amyloid deposition. For this reason, patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage and suspected of having cerebral amyloid angiopathy have often been treated nonsurgically. Since 1983 we have evaluated 11 patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (nine women and two men, mean age 73 years) who have undergone either intracerebral hematoma evacuation or brain biopsy. Nine of the 11 patients presented with intracerebral hemorrhage, which was unilobar in three patients and multilobar in six and involved the parietal lobes seven times, the frontal lobes four times, the temporal lobes four times, and the occipital lobes twice. These nine patients underwent hematoma removal, with no cases of abnormal intraoperative bleeding or recurrent hemorrhage. Six patients improved neurologically, and two were unchanged after hematoma evacuation; the remaining patient had a fatal cardiopulmonary arrest during the immediate postoperative period. During follow-up in seven patients (median 11 months, range 1 week to 74 months) none experienced a recurrent intracerebral hemorrhage and four continued to improve. Two of the 11 patients had cerebral amyloid angiopathy diagnosed by brain biopsy as part of an evaluation for dementia, also without surgical complications. This series suggests that patients with cerebral amyloid angiopathy may safely undergo operative procedures, and patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage may show neurologic improvement following evacuation of the hematoma. 
1	Black-white differences in cancer prevention knowledge and behavior. Data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey Cancer Control Supplement were used to estimate multivariate logistic regression models of diet change, mammography utilization, stool blood test utilization, and smoking. Predictor variables included race, sex, age, income, dietary concerns, and four knowledge-related variables: education and three measures of cancer prevention knowledge. When knowledge variables were included in the models, race was not a significant predictor of behavior, with one exception: among women, Blacks were found to smoke less than Whites. 
1	Adoptive immunotherapy with high-dose interleukin-2: kinetics of circulating progenitors correlate with interleukin-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor level. Immunotherapy with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells results in significant tumor regression in patients with advanced cancer. We have investigated the kinetics of circulating erythroid (BFU-E) and granulocytic-macrophage (CFU-GM) progenitors after IL-2 therapy in 11 cancer patients, mainly affected by metastatic melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Administration of IL-2 from day 1 through day 5 constantly induced a dramatic decrease of the number of circulating BFU-E and CFU-GM, which then showed a striking rebound (up to values fourfold and sevenfold higher, respectively, than the pretherapy levels) on discontinuation of IL-2, ie, from day 5 through day 10. A similar kinetic pattern was observed during and after the second cycle of IL-2 administration. 3[H]-thymidine killing experiments showed that the cycling activity of the progenitors was virtually unmodified in the rebound phases. To explore the mechanism(s) underlying this kinetic pattern, we have analyzed the plasma concentration of several hematopoietic growth factors, including IL-1 beta, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), G-CSF, and erythropoietin (Ep). No modifications in the levels of IL-3, GM-CSF, or IL-1 beta were observed, whereas a pronounced increase of IL-6 and G-CSF concentration was monitored, starting at day 3 and peaking at day 5 of treatment (a parallel, but modest, increase of Ep level was also observed). The elevation of IL-6 and G-CSF concentration is directly correlated with and may, at least in part, underlie the subsequent rebound of circulating hematopoietic progenitors. Furthermore, the increase in IL-4 level observed at day 10 of therapy may mediate the eosinophilia gradually starting at this stage of treatment. 
3	Pain experiences of intensive care unit patients. The purpose of this study was to describe various dimensions of the pain experiences of intensive care unit (ICU) patients. A purposive, primarily surgical sample of 24 ICU patients from two hospitals was interviewed after transfer from ICU. All but one patient remembered their ICU stay. Although this and six other patients had no recall of pain, 63% of the sample rated their pain as being moderate to severe in intensity. In a subgroup of nine patients having cardiac surgery, mean morphine sulfate administration during the first three postoperative days was 14 mg/day. This group of patients reported a lack of total pain relief from analgesics. Patients also described various sources of their pain, difficulties they had in communicating their pain, and nonpharmacologic methods that helped relieve their pain. Results of this study clearly indicate that not only pain but its communication and treatment were significant problems for a substantial portion of this ICU sample. Further descriptive and experimental research of pain characteristics and treatment practices for ICU patients is urgently needed. Improvements in nursing practice that result from such research may make a substantial difference in the comfort and well-being of critically ill patients. 
2	Orthotopic liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus-related liver disease Fifty-nine patients with prior hepatitis B virus infection underwent orthotopic liver transplantation. During the first 2 mo, mortality was not significantly different in the hepatitis B virus-infected group (25.5%) vs. a hepatitis B virus-immune control group (21%). Beyond 2 mo, the mortality, rate of graft loss, need for retransplantation and incidence of abnormal liver function were significantly higher in the hepatitis B virus-infected group. Treatment of the hepatitis B virus infection was attempted with passive immunization, combined active and passive immunization, alpha-interferon or nothing. The clinical outcome was not significantly influenced by any of these therapies. However, of the patients who lived more than 60 days, 6 of 22 treated with active plus passive immunization were cleared of HBsAg, something achieved once in 16 patients treated with alpha-interferon, never in 3 patients with passive immunization only and once in 4 patients with no therapy. In patients with recurrent hepatitis B virus infection, the pace of hepatitis development in the graft appeared to be accelerated, and this was particularly striking in patients who underwent multiple retransplantations at progressively shorter intervals. None of the patients who became HBsAg-negative had HBeAg preoperatively. 
2	Gastric dysrhythmias following pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Possible mechanism for early delayed gastric emptying. Transient delayed gastric emptying is reported as a frequent complication following pancreas-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPW). We placed serosal electrodes on the stomach of a patient undergoing PPW. Myoelectric recordings were obtained postoperatively and correlated with simultaneous radionuclide liquid gastric emptying studies. The patient developed early postoperative gastric atony, associated with frequent gastric dysrhythmias. These dysrhythmias may have been exacerbated by a perihepatic abscess. The gastric dysrhythmias correlated with alterations in liquid gastric emptying. Gastric dysrhythmias may be a mechanism for gastric dysfunction in the early postoperative period. 
1	Expression of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase gene in normal and leukemic cells: regulation of the transcript by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. The levels of leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) messenger RNA (mRNA) are evaluated in B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), and this transcript is found to be present only in PMNs. Precursors of the myelomonocytic pathway, represented by leukemic cells isolated from several cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in its stable and blastic phase and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), are devoid of LAP transcript. These data support the notion that LAP is a marker of the granulocyte terminal differentiation. Despite the absence of LAP mRNA in both the myeloid and the lymphoid precursors, nuclear run-on experiments show constitutive transcription of the LAP gene in leukemic cells obtained from AML, CML, as well as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). In CML and in chronic myelo-monocytic leukemia (CMML) PMNs, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) specifically accumulates LAP mRNA without showing a substantial increase in the rate of transcription of the LAP gene. Once increased by G-CSF, LAP mRNA is very stable, showing a half-life of more than 4 hours in the presence of actinomycin-D. G-CSF is suggested to play a pivotal role in the modulation of LAP transcript in PMNs. 
3	Solitary dorsal intramedullary schwannoma. Case report. A case of solitary dorsal intramedullary schwannoma diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and treated surgically is reported. The authors review the previously published cases. The possible etiology of the tumor as well as some difficulties encountered in the diagnostic procedure and treatment are discussed. 
5	Insulin-like growth factor I expression by tumors of neuroectodermal origin with the t(11;22) chromosomal translocation. A potential autocrine growth factor. Expression of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) mRNA by some tumor cell lines of neuroectodermal origin has been described. To further explore the significance of IGF-I mRNA expression in these tumors, a more extensive analysis was performed. Most (9 of 10) neuroectodermal tumor cell lines with a t(11;22) translocation (primitive neuroectodermal tumor [PNET], Ewing's sarcoma, esthesioneuroblastoma) expressed IGF-I mRNA, whereas 0 of 15 cell lines without the translocation (PNET, neuroblastoma) expressed IGF-I. Furthermore, inasmuch as all neuroblastoma (12 of 12) cell lines examined expressed IGF-II RNA, the pattern of IGF expression could distinguish between these closely related tumors. CHP-100, a PNET cell line with the t(11;22) translocation, was shown to secrete both IGF-I protein and an IGF binding protein, IGFBP-2. This cell line also expressed the type I IGF receptor mRNA, and blockade of this receptor by a monoclonal antibody (alpha IR3) inhibited serum-free growth. These data demonstrate that IGF-I expression is a property of neuroectodermal tumors with a t(11;22) translocation and that interruption of an IGF-I autocrine loop inhibits the growth of these tumor cells. 
1	Total sacrectomy and reconstruction for huge sacral tumors. The authors carried out successful total sacrectomy in three cases, two with giant cell tumors and one with a chordoma. The anterior and posterior approach is feasible for resecting huge sacral tumors en bloc, but it is important to reconstruct the continuity between the pelvic ring and spinal column using spinal instrumentation and sacral rods or AO plates. As total sacrectomy is a large-scale, time-consuming, and collaborative operation, two or three teams should be used in relays. Both pelvic and spinal surgical techniques are required. Post-operatively the patient can stand within 3 to 6 months and well-planned rehabilitation allows ambulation. In spite of the serious structural and neurologic damage caused, total sacrectomy can be rewarding procedure in terms of improved morbidity and mortality. 
5	Severe thrombocytopenia after paracetamol overdose. Two patients with severe thrombocytopenia after paracetamol overdose are described. The platelet count was lowest two days after the overdose. Neither leucopenia nor anaemia occurred. 
4	Enhanced alpha 1-adrenergic responsiveness in cardiomyopathic hamster cardiac myocytes. Relation to the expression of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. The pathogenesis of the myopathy occurring in the heart of the cardiomyopathic strain of the Syrian hamster is not well understood but is believed to be associated with abnormal calcium handling by myopathic cells. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the cardiomyopathy occurring in strain BIO 14.6 animals is associated with an enhanced alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated rise in cytosolic calcium, whether a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein is involved in coupling the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor to changes in intracellular calcium and whether enhanced alpha 1 responsiveness is associated with an increase in the level of expression of the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor or in the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein or proteins. To test the hypothesis that the cardiomyopathic state is associated with a greater alpha 1-receptor-mediated rise in cytosolic calcium, we studied the effect of phenylephrine (in the presence of propranolol) on time-averaged cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in isolated cardiac myocytes from cardiomyopathic and age-matched control hamsters. Phenylephrine caused a greater increase both in time-averaged [Ca2+]i (an increase of 48 +/- 8% versus 12 +/- 3%, p less than 0.01) and in contractility (+181 +/- 22% versus +35 +/- 9%, p less than 0.01) in cardiomyopathic than in normal cardiac myocytes. Exposure to pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml for 3 hours) attenuated the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated increase in contractility and time-averaged [Ca2+]i in both cardiomyopathic and normal cells. The level of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, as determined by pertussis toxin-mediated [32P]ADP-ribosylation, was 1.6-fold higher in cardiomyopathic versus normal hamster hearts. The density of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors, as measured by the antagonist radioligand [3H]prazosin and the affinity of the receptor for agonist and antagonist were similar in myopathic and normal heart membranes. Thus, in cardiac myocytes from hamsters, the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor-mediated effects on [Ca2+]i and contractility appear to be mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein or proteins. In myocytes from cardiomyopathic hamsters, these alpha 1-adrenergic effects were increased in magnitude, as was the level of pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, but there was no measurable alteration in the density or ligand binding properties of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. 
5	The role of lasers in hemorrhoidectomy. Eighty-eight patients who received treatment for hemorrhoids were randomized into two groups. Group A received the Nd-YAG laser phototherapy for internal hemorrhoid combined with the CO2 laser for external hemorrhoid. Group B was treated with closed Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy. The need of narcotic injections for pain relief was 11 percent in group A vs. 56 percent in group B (P less than 0.001). The incidence of postoperative urinary retention was 7 percent in group A, vs. 39 percent in group B (P less than 0.05). No enema was required postoperatively in group A, vs. 9 percent in group B; 84 percent of the patients in group A were discharged on the second postoperative day, vs. 83 percent of the patients in group B discharged on the fifth postoperative day. The cost was 20 percent less in the former group. The overall complications in both groups were insignificant in difference, except prolonged wound healing in group A was noted. One year follow-up showed satisfactory results. Laser treatment is considered one of the alternatives to conventional treatment, but the surgeon needs to be aware of laser hazards. 
2	Morphological study of cholesterol hepatolithiasis. Report of three cases. Three cases of pure cholesterol intrahepatic stones are compared morphologically to those of calcium bilirubinate stones. Cholesterol stones were found in the intrahepatic bile duct of the left lateral lobe in two cases and in both the left lateral and the right posterior lobe in one. Although the chronic inflammatory reaction and fibrous thickening of bile duct wall were similar in both types of hepatolithiasis, the proliferation of intrahepatic periductal glands and the production of mucin were rather mild, compared to that is the liner containing calcium bilirubinate stones. Multiple intramural cholesterol calculi and cholesterin granulomas (cholesterin crystals surrounded by foreign-body giant cells) were found within the cystically dilated small bile duct branches and/or conduits of periductal glands. The calculi and granulomas were characteristic for cholesterol hepatolithiasis. These findings suggest that the formation of the cholesterol stones differs from that of calcium bilirubinate stones; the perturbation of factors influencing cholesterol nucleation in the hepatic bile may be related to the changed microenvironment of the intrahepatic bile ducts, which is followed by the formation of cholesterol stones. 
5	The Dolenc technique for cavernous sinus exploration (cadaveric prosection). Technical note. This report describes a surgical approach to the cavernous sinus. Based on the work of Parkinson, Dolenc, and other pioneering investigators, a comprehensive surgical approach for the treatment of lesions of the cavernous sinus is distilled and presented in 12 simple steps. The approach to surgical exploration of this region is divided into an extradural and intradural phase, each with six steps. The bony, neural, and/or vascular structures of each step are discussed. These steps may be used in their entirety for total exploration of the cavernous sinus, but also in part for lesions that involve only limited regions of the cavernous sinus. Either by design or circumstance, every intracranial neurosurgeon will eventually be led to the cavernous sinus region, and a clear understanding of cavernous sinus anatomy should be part of their armamentarium. 
1	Primary hepatic malignancy: the role of liver transplantation. Between January 1982 and April 1989, 134 patients with a suspected liver neoplasm were referred to the liver unit, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. In 105 (78 per cent), a primary hepatic neoplasm was histologically confirmed, and 47 patients (45 per cent) proved to have primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Twenty-nine orthotopic liver transplants were performed in 28 of these patients (27 per cent). Twenty patients (71 per cent) survived 30 days or longer (median 11.5 months; range 2-87 months), of whom nine are currently alive. We retrospectively analysed our data to determine the influence of preoperative evaluation, histological type and staging on outcome. Computed tomography proved to be superior to intraoperative assessment (86 versus 58 per cent) in diagnosing tumour positive nodes. Patients with tumour negative lymphadenopathy had a better prognosis. Postoperative stage I/II had a median survival of 16 months (range 3-87 months) compared with 7.5 months (range 2-20 months) for stage III. Non-cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had the best prognosis; cholangiocellular carcinoma and cirrhotic patients with hepatocelluar carcinoma had the worst outcome with no survivors beyond 1 year. Because of the advanced stage of disease at the time of presentation, the value of liver transplantation in primary liver cancer is limited. For those presenting with advanced disease confined to the liver (stage I/II) in whom conventional hepatic resection is not possible, significant benefit can be achieved in selected cases. 
1	Cellular internalization, transport, and esterification of iodine-125-NP59 by MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. The present studies were directed toward understanding the cellular processing of the cholesterol analogue, NP59. NP59 readily entered MA-10 Leydig tumor cells. The cholesterol analogue entered the cells by binding to the plasma membrane and becoming internalized along with plasma membrane cholesterol. Internalized NP59 was readily esterified to NP59 ester. Transport of NP59 within the cell was indistinguishable from transport of cholesterol. Cholesterol and NP59 transport were under the control of cAMP, however, only cholesterol entered the mitochondria and was converted into progesterone. Thus, internalized NP59 could not be removed from the cell by conversion into steroid hormones. Esterified NP59 was metabolically inert and could not be converted back to free NP59 and free fatty acid. Since NP59 was not a substrate for the cholesteryl ester hydrolase, it became trapped in the cell as NP59 ester. 
1	A hypothesis: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the incidence of large-bowel cancer. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit prostaglandin synthesis and tumor growth in the rodent colon. We assessed NSAID use in relation to risk of human large-bowel cancer in a hospital-based, case-control study of 1326 patients with colorectal cancer and 4891 control patients. For regular NSAID use that continued into the year before interview, the multivariate relative risk estimate was 0.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.4 to 0.8); the estimate decreased as the duration of use increased, but the trend was not statistically significant. Similar results were obtained whether cancer or non-cancer controls were used, and the inverse association was apparent for both colon cancer and rectal cancer in men and women and in subjects younger and older than 60 years. Regular NSAID use that had been discontinued at least 1 year previously and non-regular use were not associated with risk. Almost all regular NSAID use was of aspirin-containing drugs. The present data suggest that the sustained use of NSAIDs reduces the incidence of human large-bowel cancer. 
5	Neuropsychological performance in patients with mild multiple sclerosis. Although changes in cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been reported, these changes have been traditionally associated with the later stages of the disease. In the current study, a comprehensive neuropsychological battery was administered to MS patients (N = 86) in whom the disease progression was relatively mild and in remission and a demographically well-matched control group (N = 46). Besides the expected differences in tests of motor function, the two groups also differed on a number of cognitive tests with no motor demands. The two cognitive functions that appear impaired were learning and memory. Given that similar deficits have been found in MS patients with more severe symptoms, it is argued that changes in cognitive function can occur in the mild stages of the disease. 
1	Angiocentric lymphoma with histologic features of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with predominant respiratory and hematologic manifestations. Report of a case and review of the literature Neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) is a rare fatal disease characterized by widespread intravascular proliferations of neoplastic mononuclear cells. Clinically, dermatologic and bizarre neurologic manifestations usually predominate. The origin of the neoplastic cells remains still undetermined. The authors report a patient with NAE peculiar with respect to the following points: (1) the patient predominantly manifested respiratory symptoms and hematologic findings and lacked cutaneous or neurologic manifestations; and (2) immunohistochemical and molecular genetic studies showed the B-cell nature of the neoplastic cells, although previous cases with predominant respiratory or hematologic manifestations were reported to be of endothelial origin. Despite the rarity, this type of NAE or angiocentric lymphoma should be recognized because it is easily confused with other disorders, particularly vasculitis or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. 
2	Helicobacter pylori and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Helicobacter pylori (previously Campylobacter pylori) is almost invariably associated with chronic duodenal ulcer disease. The relationship between H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is unknown. We investigated the frequency of H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and also what effect H. pylori infection had on gastric function in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection was diagnosed based on a specific serologic (ELISA) assay based on high-molecular-weight cell-associated proteins of H. pylori. We studied 20 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; 15 men and 5 women ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, median age 51. Six Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients had H. pylori infection compared to 100 consecutive patients with chronic recurrent duodenal ulcer disease (P less than 0.05). Pretreatment basal acid output in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients ranged from 7.9 to 95.0 mmol/hr, median 35.2. Pentagastrin-stimulated maximal acid output ranged from 8.5 to 132 mmol/hr; median 52.7. Acid secretion was lower in the H. pylori-infected patients than the uninfected patients (BAO 24.5 +/- 6.5 vs 45.4 +/- 6.6, and MAO 44.3 +/- 11.8 vs 67.9 +/- 10.7, for H. pylori infected vs uninfected patients, respectively). The difference in BAO was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). The present results indicate that H. pylori is not a major contributing factor in duodenal ulcer associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The association of a reduced BAO with H. pylori suggests that these findings may be related. 
3	The TURP syndrome. This article discusses the presentation, aetiology, treatment and prevention of central nervous system disturbances after transurethral resection of the prostate. Nausea and vomiting, visual symptoms, and altered states of consciousness have been reported as complications due to intravascular absorption of irrigating fluid. Hypotonicity after absorption of the irrigating fluid causes cerebral oedema. Hyperglycinaemia may cause visual disturbances and hyperammonaemia may cause delayed coma. 
2	Changes in high-energy phosphate metabolism and cell morphology in four models of acute experimental pancreatitis. Previous studies using the isolated ex vivo perfused canine pancreatitis preparation showed that during a 4-hour perfusion pancreatitis (edema, weight gain, hyperamylasemia) can be induced by four different stimuli. The stimuli include the intra-arterial infusion of oleic acid (FFA), a 2-hour period of ischemia before perfusion (ISCH), partial obstruction of the pancreatic duct with secretin stimulation (POSS), and the intra-arterial infusion of cerulein at supramaximal doses (CER). In the present study, changes in high-energy phosphate metabolism, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and changes in cellular structure, determined by light and electron microscopy, were documented for all four models of acute pancreatitis. The control preparations remained stable for the 4-hour perfusion period, with no decrease in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. In the FFA preparations, ATP decreased to 36% of baseline levels during the 4-hour perfusion (p less than 0.001). In the ISCH preparations, ATP decreased to undetectable levels during the 2-hour period of ischemia, but recovered rapidly and remained at baseline levels during the perfusion. ATP levels remained stable in the remaining two models of pancreatitis (POSS, CER). Microscopy demonstrated that the initial injury was located chiefly in the capillaries (swollen endothelium, intravascular thrombi) in the FFA and ISCH preparations. In the POSS and CER preparations, capillary changes were minimal and the injury was located chiefly in the acinar cells (swollen endoplasmic reticulum, zymogen granule depletion, vacuolization). The POSS preparations also showed striking dilation of centroacinar lumens reflecting duct obstruction. In additional studies it was shown that the ATP decline in the FFA preparations could be significantly reduced by pretreatment with free radical scavengers. The morphologic changes could be reduced by free radical scavengers in the FFA and ISCH preparations. Any amelioration of morphologic injury in the POSS preparations was obscured by dilatation of centroacinar lumens in both treated and untreated groups. The morphologic changes in the CER preparations were reduced by treatment with a cholecystokinin inhibitor. 
4	Small bowel enteroscopy: an early experience in gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin. Peroral small intestinal enteroscopy was performed in 35 consecutive patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin by using a prototypic Sonde-type enteroscope. The median value for patient age was 69 years; duration of bleeding, 2 years (range, 2 months to 9 years); and transfusion requirements, 9 units. Bleeding was occult in 54% of these patients. Placement and passage of the enteroscope was performed by a gastrointestinal endoscopy assistant. Mean passage time was 4.3 hours. Complete passage was obtained in 14% of the patients, passage into the mid-distal ileum in 69%, and passage only into the jejunum in 17%. The diagnostic yield was 26%, with the majority of lesions encountered being mucosal vascular malformations. Small intestinal enteroscopy is a reasonable diagnostic procedure before embarking on visceral angiography and surgical exploration when standard endoscopic and radiologic methods fail to disclose a diagnosis. 
1	Radical prostatectomy versus expectant primary treatment in stages I and II prostatic cancer. A fifteen-year follow-up. A fifteen-year follow-up of a prospective, randomized study comparing placebo with radical prostatectomy as the primary treatment of early prostatic cancer is presented. A total of 111 patients with clinical Stage I or II prostatic cancer, normal acid phosphatase levels, and negative findings on skeletal x-ray film were evaluable. Thirty Stage I patients and 20 Stage II patients received placebo only; 31 Stage I and 30 Stage II patients underwent radical prostatectomy. The survival status for 95 patients (86%) was established at the fifteen-year follow-up. No significant differences in crude survival occurred in either stage or in both stages combined. Moreover, the survival curves closely followed reference curves based on expected U.S. mortality for men of comparable ages and races. A statistically significant association between a high Gleason histologic score and poor survival was established. In this study, initial treatment with radical prostatectomy did not yield longer survival than initial placebo treatment alone. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution, since sample size was small and staging procedure was simplified. 
4	Myocardial infarction prognostic scoring system. A myocardial infarction prognostic scoring system for patients treated in a coronary care unit is described. The prognostic significance of 22 variables, all which were available on admission, were analyzed. A prognostic index was then constructed by a modified stepwise logistic regressional analysis technique. The variables that were used in the scoring system were Killip hemodynamic class, infarct location, and the maximal ST segment elevation in a single lead. The scoring system was validated in an independent group of patients, including a group of patients treated with intravenous streptokinase. The scoring system may prove to be useful for individual patient prognostication and management strategies, and for the quantification of infarct severity for use in clinical studies. 
1	HLA class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We compared human major histocompatibility (HLA) class I and class II antigen expression on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck with that on normal mucosa. Frozen sections of a consecutive series of 30 squamous cell carcinomas were stained with the monoclonal antibodies W6/32 (class I) and anti-DR (class II) using an immunoperoxidase technique. Normal mucosa showed class I and class II expression in the basal layers only. Class I expression on tumors was diffuse in 87%, patchy in 10%, and scattered in 3%. Class II expression on tumors was diffuse in 20%, patchy in 53%, scattered in 20%, and absent in 7%. Patterns of expression did not correlate significantly with clinical parameters, including survival, except that class II diffuse and patchy patterns were found to correlate with more poorly differentiated tumors. 
3	Scintigraphic measurement of oropharyngeal transit in man. Scintigraphic studies of the oropharyngeal transit of a liquid bolus were performed in 15 healthy controls, 12 patients with symptoms of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia, and 13 patients with neuromuscular disease, who did not have dysphagia. Gamma camera imaging of the head, neck, and upper thorax was undertaken, in the lateral projection, during the swallowing of the radiolabeled bolus of water. Inspection of summed images permitted the selection of regions of interest (ROI) to represent the mouth, pharynx, and upper esophagus. Transit times between each ROI were calculated and compared. Significant prolongation of bolus transit time between the mouth and esophagus was present in both patients with and without dysphagia (0.59 +/- 0.38 sec and 0.33 +/- 0.7 sec; mean +/- SD, respectively) compared with controls (0.26 +/- 0.04 sec P less than 0.001, P less than 0.01, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test). Repeat studies in 25 individuals indicated that the transit measurements were more reproducible between swallows in normal subjects than in patients with symptoms. Deglutitive scintigraphy provides a noninvasive technique for the quantitative study of swallowing and its disorders.
