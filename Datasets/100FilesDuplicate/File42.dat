3	A comparative study of naproxen sodium, pizotyline and placebo in migraine prophylaxis. 318 patients satisfying the Ad Hoc Committee's criteria for common or classical migraine were entered into an 8 week single-blind placebo recording phase to establish, by diary cards, the frequency and severity of their attacks. 176 patients completed this and had records indicating 4-8 episodes in the 8 week period, with sufficient severity to reduce activity and/or work; these patients were randomized by a predetermined code, into three double-blinded groups: naproxen sodium 550 mg bid (60 patients), pizotyline 0.5 mg tid (59 patients), or placebo (57 patients). The patients were followed at monthly intervals for 12 weeks, with 25 dropping out (3 on naproxen sodium, and 2 each on pizotyline and placebo because of "side effects;" the remaining 18 because of noncompliance or reasons unrelated to therapy). Approximately 25% of patients in each of the 3 groups complained of side effects. Statistical analysis showed that both naproxen sodium and pizotyline were better than placebo, and of overall equivalent (i.e. equal) efficacy in the prophylaxis of migraine. In some respects, naproxen sodium was slightly more effective than pizotyline in the first month of treatment. 
5	Suicide attempts by the old and the very old. Attempted suicide by the elderly is a major psychiatric problem. Ninety-five patients between 60 and 90 years of age were evaluated by a psychiatric consultation service after a suicide attempt. Characteristics of this group included (1) a high degree of premeditation, (2) a tendency toward firearm use and wounds to the head, (3) male sex, (4) coexisting medical problems, (5) serious intent that increased by decade, (6) solitary living arrangements, (7) presence or history of a major psychiatric illness, and (8) ill health reported as a precipitant to suicidality. Major depression was the most common psychiatric diagnosis, with congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the most frequently noted physical ailments. This elderly population of attempters resembled older persons who actually completed suicide and differed significantly from 1630 persons aged 16 to 59 years who attempted suicide. Heightened investigation of depressive features, treatment of alcohol abuse, early referral for psychiatric care, limited access to firearms, and strategies aimed at decreasing social isolation are recommended to decrease the likelihood of completed suicide in the elderly. 
5	Hormone implants and tachyphylaxis. The serum oestradiol levels of 1388 women treated with hormone implants at a menopause clinic were reviewed in 1988. Thirty-eight (3%) were found to be above 1750 pmol/l. Of these 38 women with supraphysiological oestradiol levels 23 had started therapy for menopausal symptoms and 15 for the premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Of the 23 women treated for menopausal symptoms 11 had a history of psychiatric referral for depression and nine had undergone a surgical menopause. Nine of the 15 women with PMS had a history of psychiatric referral for depressive symptoms. We conclude that the women who attain supraphysiological levels of oestradiol on implant therapy have a high frequency of psychopathology or surgical menopause and may require higher oestradiol levels for adequate control of symptoms. 
5	Management of premature removal of the percutaneous gastrostomy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has become the preferred method of enteral access for nutritional support. With increased use of this modality, complications are encountered more frequently. Premature withdrawal, inadvertent removal of the gastrostomy tube within the first seven days after insertion, before adherence of the gastric serosa to the parietal peritoneum, has been an indication for laparotomy. This report describes the treatment of premature withdrawal by immediate endoscopic replacement. Over an 18-month period, 271 patients underwent insertion of a PEG. Five patients (1.8%) who inadvertently removed their gastrostomy tube within seven days of insertion were treated with immediate replacement using the retrograde string technique, avoiding laparotomy. All five PEGs were successfully replaced through the same gastrostomy site. Despite the presence of pneumoperitoneum, no patient developed peritonitis or other septic complications. Premature gastrostomy tube withdrawal is safely managed by endoscopic replacement and observation. Laparotomy is unnecessary and potentially meddlesome. 
3	Botulinum toxin treatment of cranial-cervical dystonia, spasmodic dysphonia, other focal dystonias and hemifacial spasm. In the past five years, 477 patients with various focal dystonias and hemifacial spasm received 3,806 injections of botulinum A toxin for relief of involuntary spasms. A definite improvement with a global rating greater than or equal to 2 on a 0-4 scale, was obtained in all 13 patients with spasmodic dysphonia, 94% of 70 patients with blepharospasm, 92% of 13 patients with hemifacial spasm, 90% of 195 patients with cervical dystonia, 77% of 22 patients with hand dystonia, 73% of 45 patients with oromandibular dystonia, and in 90% of 21 patients with other focal dystonia who had adequate follow up. While the average duration of maximum improvement lasted about 11 weeks after an injection (range seven weeks in patients with hand dystonia to 15 weeks in patients with hemifacial spasm), some patients benefited for over a year. Only 16% of the 941 treatment visits with follow up were not successful. Except for transient focal weakness, there were very few complications or systemic effects attributed to the injections. This study supports the conclusion that botulinum toxin injections are a safe and effective therapy for patients with focal dystonia and hemifacial spasm. 
5	Molecular characterization of inherited medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Deficiency of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) is a common inherited defect in energy metabolism. Characterization of the mRNA encoding MCAD in a Dutch MCAD-deficient patient revealed an A----G change at nucleotide position 985 of the MCAD mRNA coding region. This point mutation results in the substitution of a glutamic acid for a lysine at amino acid position 304 of the mature protein. The single base change was not found in any wild-type MCAD mRNAs. A mutant allele-specific oligonucleotide probe was used in a hybridization analysis of amplified genomic DNA of MCAD-deficient family members, a carrier, and normal individuals. The hybridization analysis specifically identified individuals who were heterozygotes or homozygotes. In addition to the point mutation, a significant proportion of the index patient's MCAD mRNA contained a variety of deletions and insertions as a result of exon skipping and intron retention. The missplicing occurred in multiple regions throughout the MCAD mRNA. Analysis of the patient's MCAD gene in the regions where the missplicing occurred most frequently did not reveal a mutation in the splicing acceptor or donor sites. Therefore, the molecular characterization of this family revealed a crucial point mutation in the MCAD gene and an unusual abnormality in MCAD pre-mRNA splicing. 
5	Coronary artery aneurysm without stenosis in association with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease--a case report. A fifty-three-year-old woman presented with coronary artery aneurysm in association with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) manifested also by large pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas. The arterial dye dilution curves were unusually distorted owing to the right-to-left shunts. The coronary artery aneurysm was located in multiple sites but was not accompanied by stenotic lesions. Coronary artery aneurysm without stenosis is a rare pathologic state and has not been previously reported in association with hereditary telangiectasia. 
5	Treatment of intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy with thrombin. Report of three patients. Of 165 consecutive patients undergoing computerized tomography- or magnetic resonance imaging-guided stereotactic brain biopsies at the Cleveland Clinic between June, 1987, and November, 1989, four patients (2.4%) developed arterial hemorrhage refractory to conventional efforts to secure hemostasis. Craniotomy was performed in one of these patients to control the hemorrhage; in the other three, 0.5 to 2 cc of thrombin (5000 U/cc) was slowly injected via the biopsy cannula, resulting in immediate control of bleeding in all three cases. Postoperatively, the first two patients treated with 1 to 2 cc of thrombin were slow to awaken; one had evidence of vasospasm by transcranial Doppler ultrasound studies and multiple infarcts on cranial computerized tomography, while the other had a moderate-sized frontal hematoma with intracranial hypertension. After prolonged recovery periods, only mild neurological deficits persisted in both patients. The third patient, treated with 0.5 cc of thrombin, had an uneventful postoperative course. Thrombin is highly effective for stopping intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy; however, it is a vasospastic agent and may have been responsible for the cerebral infarctions in one patient. Therefore, thrombin should be used only as a last resort, short of craniotomy, to control intractable arterial hemorrhage during stereotactic brain biopsy. 
3	Rehabilitation of chronic stroke patients: changes in functional performance. Forty stroke patients who were at least one year post-onset completed a one-month intensive rehabilitation program. The month before the program served as a control period. During the program, patients received individual sessions in occupational and physical therapy four days a week, and they participated in group activities on the fifth day. Therapy emphasized instruction in motor planning, balance and weight shift, and the use of adaptive equipment; these motor abilities were then practiced within real life situations. The patients demonstrated significant improvement in the outcome measures of weight shift, balance, and ADL scores after the one-month rehabilitation program (weight shift: F = 16.1, p = .0001; balance: F = 6.26, p = .0007; ADL: F = 13.8, p = .0001). They retained these new skills during a three-month follow-up period. 
5	Tension pneumothorax secondary to a gastropleural fistula in a traumatic diaphragmatic hernia. We report a case of tension pneumothorax due to a gastropleural fistula resulting from perforation of the stomach in a traumatic diaphragmatic hernia. Awareness of perforation of strangulated stomach or bowel in a diaphragmatic hernia as a cause of pneumothorax, with or without tension physiology, in a patient with a history of trauma is important so that surgical repair can be undertaken without delay. 
5	Measurement of progressive cerebral ventriculomegaly in infants after grades III and IV intraventricular hemorrhages. To develop guidelines that might help predict prospectively which infants with severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) would require intervention, we obtained serial cranial sonograms to measure the rate of growth of cerebral ventricular volumes in 48 preterm infants with and without IVH. The infants were divided into three groups: (1) those with no IVH (22 infants), (2) those with IVH with acute ventricular dilation (13 infants), and (3) those with IVH with progressive ventricular dilation requiring intervention (13 infants). The decision to intervene because of progressive ventricular dilation was based on clinical criteria and the subjective assessment of increasing ventricular size on weekly cranial sonograms. The rate of cerebral ventricular volume growth in infants with IVH who needed intervention was greater (4.2 +/- 3.3 ml/day) than that in infants without IVH (0.0 +/- 0.1 ml/day; p less than 0.001) and in infants with IVH and acute ventricular dilation (0.0 +/- 0.2 ml/day; p less than 0.001). Using these data, we generated guidelines for predicting prospectively which infants with IVH and ventricular dilation will need intervention for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. The guidelines were then confirmed prospectively in 10 infants. 
4	Cardiovascular response of a continuous variable rate alfentanil infusion for abdominal aortic surgery. A prospective study was undertaken to determine the cardiovascular response of a continuous alfentanil infusion during abdominal aortic surgery (AAS). Each subject (n = 20) received a beta-blocking drug preoperatively, and was premedicated with oral lorazepam. Anaesthesia was induced with alfentanil 50 micrograms.kg-1 and thiopentone 3 mg.kg-1, and was maintained with a variable rate infusion of alfentanil and 66 per cent nitrous oxide in oxygen. During the infusion, boluses of alfentanil, 7.5 micrograms.kg-1, were administered to maintain heart rate and blood pressure within 20 per cent of awake baseline values. Haemodynamic stability during surgery was achieved with infusion rates varying between 0.5 and 2.5 micrograms.kg-1, which resulted in mean alfentanil serum concentrations ranging from 186 +/- 53 to 315 +/- 98 ng.ml-1. The mean cumulative alfentanil dose was 15.4 +/- 6.2 mg.patient-1 for surgery which lasted an average of 141 +/- 41 min. Throughout surgery, no patient required inhalational anaesthetic agents or vasoactive drugs. Fifteen of the 20 patients had perioperative Holter monitoring. No myocardial ischaemia was detected during the intraoperative period. However, there was a 33 per cent incidence of myocardial ischaemia on the first postoperative day. There were no myocardial infarcts and no deaths. We conclude that in beta-blocked patients undergoing aortic reconstructive surgery, a variable rate alfentanil infusion administered with 66 per cent nitrous oxide provides anaesthesia characterized by good haemodynamic control without the need for supplemental agents or vasoactive drugs. 
5	Studies of the route, magnitude, and time course of bacterial translocation in a model of systemic inflammation. Bacteria have been documented to translocate from the gut to systemic organs, yet the exact route by which they translocate remains unclear. To determine the route of bacterial translocation, different dosages of zymosan were used to activate complement and cause systemic inflammation. At a zymosan dose of 0.1 mg/g, bacteria translocated only to the mesenteric lymph node complex, whereas at a dose of 0.5 mg/g the bacteria translocated systematically. In rats receiving 0.5-mg/g doses of zymosan, the bacteria appeared to reach systemic organs via the portal blood rather than via the mesenteric lymph, as bacteria were present in 87% of portal blood samples but only 25% of lymph samples. The number of bacteria exiting the portal vein was 11,500 times greater than the number exiting via the lymph. Thus, both the route and extent of bacterial translocation varies based on the magnitude of the inflammatory insult, with the portal blood being the major route of bacterial translocation to systemic organs. 
1	Significance of surgical adjuvant chemotherapy for gastric cancer. One hundred and twenty-four specimens (72 primaries and 52 metastases) in 107 patients with gastric cancer were tested using the human tumor clonogenic assay (HTCA). Assays for 64 specimens (52%, 33 primaries and 31 metastases) were considered evaluable. The clonogenicity of the primaries was less than that of the metastases (P less than 0.01). In the primary specimens, well-differentiated tumors were more highly clonogenic than poorly differentiated or signet ring cell tumors (P less than 0.05). Viable malignant cells and clonogenic cells were abundant in the primary tumors with mucosal (m) and submucosal (sm) invasion, i.e., in early gastric cancers by Japanese criteria, and were reduced in numbers as the primary tumors advanced (P less than 0.05). In vitro chemosensitivity corresponded well to the clonogenicity of the primary tumors stratified by the degree of tumor invasion. At the early phase of primary tumor progression and metastasis, clonogenicity and chemosensitivity were high. Aggressive chemotherapy with sensitive drugs after surgery may improve the clinical results for the gastric cancer patients with early phase of metastases. 
5	Effect of prostaglandin E1 infusion on leukocyte traffic and fibrosis in acute lung injury induced by bleomycin in hamsters. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the iv infusion of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) could modify the early influx of neutrophils into bleomycin-injured lungs and if that would affect subsequent development of inflammation and fibrosis. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: In vivo controlled animal study performed in a university hospital pulmonary research laboratory. Male Syrian golden hamsters (100- to 110-g body weight) were divided into four treatment groups: a) No treatment; b) intratracheal bleomycin plus PGE1 infusion; c) bleomycin plus saline infusion; d) PGE1 infusion only. PGE1 (180 ng/hr.100 g) or saline were infused iv 3 to 25 hr after intratracheal instillation of bleomycin sulfate (0.5 U/0.5 mL.100 g). Total and differential counts of cells recovered by lavage, lavage fluid protein, and lung total protein and hydroxyproline levels were measured from 6 hr to 30 days later. RESULTS: PGE1 infusion reduced the influx of neutrophils 6 hr after bleomycin injury by 53% compared with saline infusion (p less than .0001), but increased inflammatory cell traffic after 24 hr for 15 days. At 4 days, protein recovered in lung lavage fluid was also decreased in PGE1-treated, bleomycin-injured animals, reflecting reduced injury to lung permeability barriers. Accumulation of lung collagen in the PGE1-treated, bleomycin-instilled hamsters tended to be lower than in the bleomycin-injured, saline-infused group at 15 and 30 days, although these differences did not achieve statistical significance. Despite this fact, greater than 33% of the animals in the PGE1-treated group died, possibly indicating an increased risk of sepsis in these animals. CONCLUSIONS: PGE1 infusion can decrease early neutrophil traffic and reduce injury to the lung permeability barriers. However, this treatment augments late inflammatory events and does not significantly alter the development of fibrosis. 
4	Oral contraceptives and myocardial infarction. The risk of myocardial infarction in contraceptive users is limited to women over 35 years of age who smoke. The cause of myocardial infarction in oral contraceptive users is thrombotic and not atherosclerotic. Minor lipid changes have no clinical relevance to myocardial infarction in contraceptive pill users and do not appear to increase coronary plaques. 
5	Aggressive oral refeeding in hospitalized patients. Malnutrition is an important clinical condition leading to increased morbidity and mortality. This report describes an aggressive oral refeeding program of high-caloric foods, which was instituted in severely anorectic patients because of their refusal to eat meals or supplements. After ascertaining a patient's favorite sweet, hospital personnel and family collaborated in providing the food. Frequently, sweets were the patient's only intake for weeks. We saw a gradual return of appetite, inclusion of other foods in the diet, and overall clinical improvement in comorbid conditions. These cases suggest that aggressive oral refeeding with high-caloric foods is an underutilized therapy for multiply impaired elderly patients. 
4	Clinical association of autoantibodies to fibrillarin with diffuse scleroderma and disseminated telangiectasia. Circulating autoantibodies against a variety of nuclear and nucleolar antigens are characteristic serologic findings in systemic scleroderma. Some of these antibodies correlate with clinical subsets of the disease. We describe three patients with systemic scleroderma and high autoantibody titers against U3 ribonucleoprotein-associated fibrillarin, a recently identified 34 kD nucleolar protein. These patients showed a progressive course with multiple organ and diffuse skin involvement with disseminated telangiectasia. 
2	Intraoperative scintigraphy for active small intestinal bleeding. Localizing active sites of bleeding within the small intestine remains a difficult task. Endoscopic, angiographic or scintigraphic studies may point to the small intestine as the site of blood loss, but at operation, without a palpable lesion, the exact site of bleeding remains elusive. Patients are managed at laparotomy with intraoperative endoscopy, angiography, multiple enterotomies, "blind" resections, or placement of an enterostomy. We describe two patients in whom intraoperative scintigraphy accurately identified active sites of bleeding in the small intestine when other modalities failed. Intraoperative scintigraphy is rapid, easy to perform and is an effective means of identifying active sites of bleeding within the small intestine. 
2	Levels of the human hepatocyte growth factor in serum of patients with various liver diseases determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We have found a hepatotrophic factor in plasma or sera of patients with fulminant hepatic failure and have purified human hepatocyte growth factor from plasma of these patients. In this study we developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with high specificity and sensitivity for human hepatocyte growth factor in human serum. This assay for serum human hepatocyte growth factor is a sandwich method consisting of three steps. The standard curve for human hepatocyte growth factor appeared to be linear in the range of 0.20 to 12.50 ng purified human hepatocyte growth factor/ml (2.35 to 147 pmol/L). The assay took about 4 hr. Serum human hepatocyte growth factor values in patients with fulminant hepatic failure measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed a strong positive correlation with that by bioassay using rat hepatocytes in primary culture. The mean value of serum human hepatocyte growth factor for 30 normal subjects was 0.24 +/- 0.12 (S.D.) ng/ml; that for 23 patients with fulminant hepatic failure was 8.06 +/- 1.76 (S.E.M.) ng/ml- greater than 30 times greater than the mean value for normal subjects. Serum human hepatocyte growth factor levels in patients with acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis were found to be slightly higher than those in normal subjects, but only the increase in serum human hepatocyte growth factor of acute hepatitis patients was statistically significant. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum human hepatocyte growth factor should prove useful for serum human hepatocyte growth factor level measurement in patients with various liver diseases. 
3	The epilepsies: clinical implications of the international classification. From the earliest days of neurology, the classification of epileptic seizures into those generalized from the beginning and those with a definable localization in the cortex from the onset has added to knowledge about the function of the nervous system. Further elaboration of the classification of seizures into those localized to the six-layered isocortex and those whose elaboration involves regions of the brain involved with consciousness and memory has provided the basic focus for the burgeoning subspecialty of epilepsy surgery. It is increasingly apparent that the etiology of a seizure disorder is of at least equal or of greater significance than the nature of the seizures it spawns and is the product not only of localization in the nervous system but also of causative factors with implications reaching into areas of genetics, higher cortical function, and intelligence. The prognosis concerning the outcome of the epilepsy under consideration is based on all of these facets. This pathophysiological substratum, of which the seizure is only the presenting symptom, constitutes the epilepsy or epileptic syndrome on which the formulation of a rational treatment plan is based. 
1	Ectopic thyroid tissue in the submandibular region. This report describes an unusual location of ectopic thyroid gland tissue. A growth in the left submandibular area was surgically excised, and the microscopic examination of the specimen revealed thyroid tissue with colloid goiter. Because this entity cannot be clinically distinguished from a salivary gland tumor, ectopic thyroid tissue should be considered in the differential diagnosis of swellings involving the submandibular area. 
4	Hepatic portal venous gas: an unusual presentation of Crohn's disease. Hepatic portal venous gas is associated with numerous conditions and traditionally has been regarded as an ominous prognostic sign. There are several reports of hepatic portal venous gas occurring in patients with inflammatory bowel disease after or during the performance of colonic diagnostic studies. We report an unusual case of Crohn's disease whose initial presentation included hepatic portal venous gas. The literature of hepatic portal venous gas associated with inflammatory bowel disease is reviewed. 
5	Problems and solutions of pedicle screw plate fixation of lumbar spine. Fifty-seven patients with low back pain and sciatica of various causes were reviewed with reference to problems associated with pedicle plate fixation of the lumbar spine. Eleven percent of patients had neurologic problems postoperatively and 3.5% (two patients) had severe sensory impairments. All patients had this complication in the early phases of the study. Of 297 screws, 17 broke, ie, 5.7%. These breakages occurred in 12 of 57 patients (21%). In patients with spondylolisthesis, the degree of slip correction averaged 53% postoperatively, which decreased to 35% at the 1-year follow-up. Slip angle was maintained after correction. Pedicle screw plate fixation is an effective form of immobilization of the lumbar spine used in achieving arthrodesis. The surgeon must be fully trained in methodology. It is recommended that screw and plate materials be improved to prevent screw breakage. 
5	Seizures and other neurologic sequelae of bacterial meningitis in children. BACKGROUND. Although the mortality rate among children with bacterial meningitis has decreased dramatically in recent decades, some patients are left with neurologic sequelae. It has not been clearly established which features of the acute illness predict the chronic neurologic sequelae, including late seizures or epilepsy. METHODS. We followed 185 infants and children prospectively during and after acute bacterial meningitis. The mean duration of follow-up was 8.9 years (range, 0.1 to 15.5). During the first six years standard neurologic examinations were performed; telephone interviews were conducted thereafter. RESULTS. One month after meningitis, 69 children (37 percent) had neurologic abnormalities. Many of these signs resolved within a year, leaving only 26 children (14 percent) with persistent deficits: 18 (10 percent) had only sensorineural hearing loss, and 8 (4 percent) had multiple neurologic deficits. Thirteen children (7 percent) had one or more late seizures not associated with fever. The presence of persistent neurologic deficits indicative of cerebral injury was the only independent predictor of late afebrile seizures (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. After bacterial meningitis only children with permanent neurologic deficits are at high risk for epilepsy. Those with normal examinations after the acute illness have an excellent change of escaping serious neurologic sequelae, including epilepsy. 
1	Epidermodysplasia verruciformis-associated papillomavirus infection complicating human immunodeficiency virus disease. Three males infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were noted to have extensive flat warts of the face and/or body. In two there were also pityriasis versicolor-like lesions. Biopsies showed foamy, basophilic, distended cytoplasm in granular layer keratinocytes, characteristic of the human papillomavirus types seen in epidermodysplasia verruciformis. DNA hybridization techniques demonstrated the presence of HPV-type 8 in one patient and HPV 5 and 8 in another. Patients with immune suppression due to HIV infection may demonstrate the clinical features of epidermodysplasia verruciformis with the same potentially oncogenic HPV types. 
1	Crohn's disease and adenocarcinoma of the intestinal tract. Report of four cases. Four patients with intestinal adenocarcinoma complicating Crohn's disease are reported. The youngest of the four patients was a 21-year-old female with a 9-year history of Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum as well as of the entire colon. She developed mucus-producing moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the cecum. Of the remaining three patients with Crohn's disease, one presented an adenocarcinoma in the ascending colon, one in the rectum and the remaining one in the duodenum. All three colorectal adenocarcinomas originated in areas of high-grade dysplasia and all four in areas with chronic transmural inflammation. The review of the literature indicates that a total of 174 small and large bowel cancers occurring in Crohn's disease have been recorded (including the four reported herein). The vast majority of the reported cases have been found in the North American subcontinent. Only in a few instances were bowel adenocarcinoma and Crohn's disease observed in the European continent. It is therefore remarkable that three of our four cases were seen within a period of 12 months. Interestingly, six patients having colorectal adenocarcinoma in association with Crohn's disease were recently reported from a single hospital in England. The question therefore arises whether our cases and those reported recently from England are unrelated and merely coincidental or whether carcinomas are now also affecting European CD patients. If the latter is the case, the surveillance policy for patients with CD should be reconsidered at this hospital. 
5	Death notification. Family notification in sudden, unexpected, and violent death is a major responsibility of law enforcement, medical examiner, and coroner offices. This report reviews and discusses the process and procedures utilized in death notification and provides suggestions to accomplish this difficult task more effectively. 
2	Computerized identification of pathologic duodenogastric reflux using 24-hour gastric pH monitoring. Duodenogastric reflux is a naturally occurring sporadic event, the incidence, occurrence, and detrimental effects of which have been difficult to assess. The reliability of 24-hour gastric pH monitoring to detect duodenogastric reflux was studied. Central to the use of pH monitoring for this purpose is confidence in its ability to measure and display pH data in a way that reflects changes in the gastric pH environment with sufficient sensitivity. To test this the gastric pH of 10 dogs was measured in the fasting state, after feeding, and after pentagastrin stimulation. The antrum was more alkaline in the fasting state (p less than 0.01) and the display of data by frequency distribution graph was sensitive enough to reflect induced pH changes. To test the consistency of gastric pH at a given position, simultaneous 24-hour gastric monitoring was performed in 12 normal subjects with two probes placed at either 5 or 10 cm below the lower esophageal sphincter. Only at the 5-cm position did the two probes read within 1 pH unit of each other more than 90% of the time. Based on these principles, gastric pH monitoring was performed 5 cm below the lower esophageal sphincter in 30 normal subjects and 11 patients, fulfilling Ritchie's clinical criteria for pathologic duodenogastric reflux. The data obtained was arranged into 71 variables and subjected to discriminant analysis. Sixteen variables were identified, each with a corresponding coefficient to be used as a multiplier to derive a score. A score of more than +2.2 indicated a high probability of pathologic duodenogastric reflux. The test was applied to a validation population consisting of 10 additional normal subjects and 10 patients meeting Ritchie's criteria. All normal subjects had a normal score and all but one (90%) of the patients had an abnormal score. When compared to O-diisopropyl iminodiacetic acid (DISIDA) scintigraphy in another group of 22 normal subjects and 60 patients, 24-hour gastric pH monitoring was superior in the detection of pathologic duodenogastric reflux. The study shows how the application of computer technology can be used to diagnose pathologic duodenogastric reflux in patients with complex foregut complaints. 
4	Aortic dissection with the entrance tear in transverse aorta: analysis of 12 autopsy patients. Clinical and autopsy findings are described in 12 patients who had fatal aortic dissection with the entrance tear in the transverse aorta. The 12 patients represent 7% of 182 autopsies of spontaneous aortic dissection studied by us. The ages of the 12 patients at death ranged from 37 to 87 years (mean, 67 years). Eight were men; 8 had a history of systemic hypertension, and 10 had hearts of increased weight. Diagnosis of aortic dissection was made during life in only 4 of the 12 patients. All 12 patients died of rupture of the false channel within 2 weeks of onset of signs or symptoms compatible with dissection. The direction of aortic dissection from the entrance tear was entirely retrograde in 4 patients, entirely anterograde in 4 patients, and in both directions in 4 patients. Hemopericardium occurred in the first group, left hemothorax in the second group, and either in the last group. Of the 8 patients in whom the ascending aorta was involved, the retrograde dissection in each extended to the aortic root, 6 had pulmonary adventitial hemorrhage, and 4 had involvement of the arch arteries by dissection. In the 4 patients with strictly anterograde dissection, none had dissection in the arch arteries. Thus, tear in the transverse aorta causes a dissection that is usually fata, that often dissects retrogradely, and that may mimic dissection from a tear in ascending aorta. Aortic dissection from a tear in transverse aorta requires early operative intervention. 
1	Evaluation of the fine needle aspiration biopsy in the preoperative selection of cold thyroid nodules. From 1980 to 1988 the authors examined by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) 4609 patients with solitary thyroid nodules or multinodular goiters. A total of 5605 "cold" thyroid nodules were evaluated and classified, on the basis of the cytologic findings, as malignant, follicular lesions (probably malignant and probably benign) and benign. Then the authors compared the preoperative cytologic findings with the postoperative histologic results in 827 nodules from patients who underwent surgery. In the 805 thyroid nodules in which an adequate cytologic specimen was obtained, false-negative results were 2.3% and false-positive findings were 1.1% By comparing cytologic and histologic diagnoses, preoperative FNAB resulted in the ability to accurately assess the risk of cancer in a thyroid nodule; since 250 nodules were identified as malignant, the risk of a "cold" thyroid nodule being cancer was 4.46% in this series. 
1	Buschke-Loewenstein tumor: verrucous carcinoma of the penis. The Buschke-Loewenstein tumor is an anogenital tumor of characteristic clinical and histologic pattern best considered as a low-grade, well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. This remarkable neoplasm and its features are reviewed in detail, stressing salient advances in our understanding of it. 
4	Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in patients who undergo open heart surgery. To determine whether heparin-dependent antiplatelet antibodies (HAAb) have an effect on morbidity and/or mortality rates, we reviewed the cases of 3438 patients who underwent open heart surgery from 1981 to 1989. Forty-six patients (1.3%) had HAAb. The patients were divided into two groups: those patients who were known to have HAAb before surgery (group I) and those patients who were diagnosed with HAAb after surgery (group II). Group I patients (n = 5) were pretreated with platelet-inhibiting drugs before reexposure to heparin during cardiopulmonary bypass and were maintained with strict abstinence from heparin afterward. Their lowest observed platelet counts ranged from 42,000/mm3 to 89,000/mm3 (median, 63,00/mm3). Thromboembolic complications did not occur, and all patients survived. Group II patients (n = 41) who were diagnosed to have HAAb after surgery had not been pretreated with platelet-inhibiting drugs before surgery. Lowest platelet counts ranged from 11,000/mm3 to 128,000/mm3 (median, 42,000/mm3). Bleeding complications occurred in 21 patients (51%), and thromboembolic complications occurred in 13 patients (32%). Hospital mortality in group II patients was 37%. Late recognition of HAAb was associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality rates. Thromboembolic complications of HAAb, which had been diagnosed before surgery, were eliminated, and bleeding was reduced by pretreatment with platelet-inhibiting drugs and strict abstinence from heparin after surgery. 
5	Motor dysfunction in HIV-infected patients without clinically detectable central-nervous deficit. Motor tests were performed in 50 HIV-infected patients in all stages according to the current CDC classification, but without any clinically evident central nervous system deficit, and the results compared with an age-matched control group. Patients were excluded from the study if there was alcohol or drug abuse, fever and/or opportunistic cerebral infection. The parameters tested were postural tremor of the outstretched hands, most rapid voluntary alternating index finger movements (MRAM) and rise time of most rapid index finger extensions (MRC). Whereas tremor peak frequencies did not differ significantly in the patients and controls, MRAM and rise times of MRCs showed significant slowing in the patient group. Morphologically, the motor test performance of the HIV-infected patients was similar to that of patients with manifest basal ganglia disease (Parkinson's, Huntington's and Wilson's diseases). MRI scans of all patients were normal. It is concluded that in HIV-infected patients there is a very early subclinical central nervous system affection, especially of the basal ganglia, which is detectable with appropriate, quantitative motor function tests. These functional abnormalities precede the structural alterations in the MRI scans. 
3	Tuberculous meningitis. Tuberculous meningitis is an uncommon but potentially devastating form of tuberculosis. Current antituberculous drugs are highly effective when treatment is initiated early, before the onset of altered mentation or focal neurologic deficits. Because the clinical outcome depends greatly on the stage at which therapy is initiated, early recognition is of paramount importance. Patients with the meningoencephalitis syndrome and CSF findings of low glucose levels, elevated protein levels, and pleocytosis should be treated immediately if there is evidence of TB elsewhere in the body, or if prompt evaluation fails to establish an alternative diagnosis. Examination of CSF is the best diagnostic approach; with sufficient diligence, serial AFB smears and cultures will usually yield positive results, even days after therapy has been started. The CT scan is an important and highly effective tool for the diagnosis and management of patients with TBM. In a patient with compatible clinical features, the combination of basilar meningeal enhancement and any degree of hydrocephalus is strongly suggestive of the diagnosis of TBM. Serial evaluation by CT scanning is useful for following the course of hydrocephalus and tuberculoma, particularly in reference to the need for, or response to, adjunctive therapy with corticosteroids and surgery. The decision to administer corticosteroids should be based on careful correlation of the clinical and radiographic features of the case. Surgical shunting should be considered early in the patient with hydrocephalus and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. Tuberculomas are best treated medically, often in conjunction with corticosteroids where cerebral edema is believed to contribute to neurologic decline. The recommended chemotherapy regimen is isoniazid and rifampin in all patients, together with pyrazinamide for the first 2 months. 
5	Severe anaphylactoid reaction to hydroxyethyl starch. A case is presented of a severe anaphylactoid reaction to hydroxyethyl starch solution that occurred peri-operatively and required extended intensive management of the resultant bronchospasm and hypotension. Subsequent intradermal injection of hetastarch produced a delayed positive response, suggestive of a complement-mediated mechanism. 
1	Changes in intracochlear and intracanalicular nerves after acoustic neurinoma excision confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. Postoperative magnetic resonance imaging findings related to the vestibulocochlear and facial nerves within the internal auditory canal were analyzed in acoustic neurinomas. T1- and proton-weighted magnetic resonance images showed that the vestibulocochlear nerves distal to the internal auditory meatus increased in signal intensity after surgical intervention. These nerves were conspicuously enhanced after intravenous administration of gadolinium diethylene-triamine-pentaacetic acid. The preserved facial nerves were also markedly enhanced postoperatively. As a possible cause of these findings, we suggest operative disruption of the blood-nerve barrier with ensuing nerve edema, although the operative procedures were carefully carried out using a surgical microscope. The clinical significance of traumatic disruption of the blood-nerve barrier and subsequent nerve edema are discussed from the standpoint of preservation of cochlear nerve function. 
5	The role of antibiotic therapy in the prevention of empyema in patients with an isolated chest injury (ISS 9-10): a prospective study. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of an antibiotic regimen on the incidence of empyema in patients admitted with isolated chest trauma (ISS 9/10) and hemopneumothorax requiring tube thoracostomy. All patients with isolated chest trauma and hemopneumothorax (estimated ISS 9 or 10) seen in our trauma center were considered eligible for this study. Patients were excluded for the following reasons: age less than 18 years, presence of shock at the time of initial resuscitation, ongoing antibiotic therapy for unrelated disease, documented pre-existing infection or documented abnormal immune status. Ninety patients were randomized to two treatment limbs: antibiotics and tube thoracostomy or tube thoracostomy alone. All patients had the procedure performed in the trauma center in a standard fashion. Wound care and tube care were identical. Antibiotic therapy consisted of a first-generation cephalosporin (cefazolin), one dose given just before the procedure and then q 6 h into the tube removal. Injury Severity Scores were established as described by Schwab after the manner of Baker. Statistical analysis was performed using Fisher's exact test of binary outcome. In this study, antibiotics were able to reduce the incidence of empyema in patients with isolated chest trauma and for such patients antibiotic treatment appears justified. Further work is required to determine the effect on patients with more severe injury and multisystem involvement. 
1	Suppression of tumorigenicity in human colon carcinoma cells by introduction of normal chromosome 5 or 18. Development of colon carcinomas can be associated with allelic deletions on several chromosomes, including 5q and 18q. The APC gene on 5q and the DCC gene on 18q have been identified as potential tumour suppressor genes, whose suppression contributes to colon carcinogenesis. To investigate the role of genes in these deleted regions, we have now introduced a single normal human chromosome into a human colon carcinoma cell line, COKFu, through microcell hybridization. Several clones of hybrid cells containing normal chromosome 5, and others containing normal chromosome 18, were obtained. The morphology of the hybrid cells was markedly altered: the hybrids with chromosome 5 exhibited a closely packed polygonal morphology, and the hybrid cells with chromosome 18 were flattened. The cloning efficiency of the hybrid cells in soft agar was reduced from 0.46 to 0% of that of the parental carcinoma cells, and the tumorigenicity of these hybrid cells in athymic nude mice was completely suppressed. The growth properties of the hybrid cells with chromosome 11 were not substantially changed. These results strongly suggest that the genes on normal chromosome 5 and 18 function as tumour suppressors in colon carcinogenesis. 
4	Preanaesthetic medication with clonidine. The purpose of this study was to evaluate oral clonidine in a dose of 0.3 mg as a routine premedicant. Sixty-nine normotensive female patients were studied in a randomized double-blind investigation in which clonidine was compared with an inert treatment. Clonidine produced a significant reduction in anxiety (P less than 0.05) and sedation and a reduction in the sleep dose of methohexitone (P less than 0.05). Tachycardia in response to intubation was attenuated by clonidine (P less than 0.05). However, the magnitude of the increase in arterial pressure after intubation was not affected. Intraoperative and postoperative hypotension were common after premedication with clonidine 0.3 mg and caution is urged in its use as a premedicant. 
1	Down's syndrome and acute leukemia in children: an analysis of phenotype by use of monoclonal antibodies and electron microscopic platelet peroxidase reaction The clinical, hematologic, and immunophenotypic features in 20 patients with Down's syndrome (DS) and acute leukemia were analyzed. Of the 20 patients, all 14 patients who were 3 years old and less were diagnosed as having acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) by use of platelet-specific monoclonal antibodies and platelet peroxidase (PPO) reaction in electron microscopy. They were characterized by the presence of bone marrow fibrosis, having a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a poor response to chemotherapy. Only one patient has remained in continuous complete remission for more than 1 year. Acute leukemia in six patients who were older than 4 years was classified as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (CALLA)-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In one of six patients classified as ALL, the leukemic blasts simultaneously expressed myeloid-associated surface antigens. All six patients achieved a complete remission and have remained in continuous complete remission and have remained in continuous complete remission from 10 to 52 months from the initial diagnosis. Although it has been suggested that the distribution of types of acute leukemia in patients with DS is similar to that in normal children, the present study shows that the distribution of acute leukemia types is quite different from that in patients without Down's syndrome. 
5	Lymph node metastasis in spindle cell carcinoma arising in odontogenic cyst. Report of a case. The majority of primary intraosseous carcinomas of the jaws develop in preexisting odontogenic cysts. These tumors are usually well-differentiated keratinizing carcinomas with relatively good prognosis. Only two of 41 previously reported acceptable cases of primary intraosseous carcinomas from ex-odontogenic cysts were associated with cervical lymph node metastasis. Spindle cell carcinoma is an anaplastic dimorphic neoplasm with poor prognosis. It has a special predilection for the upper aerodigestive tract. This is to our knowledge the first report of spindle cell carcinoma developing in an odontogenic cyst. Cervical lymph node metastasis showing typical histologic features of spindle cell carcinoma was detected 8 months postoperatively. The prognostic implications of this finding are discussed in light of previously reported cases of intraosseous carcinoma arising in odontogenic cysts and of spindle cell carcinoma of the oral cavity. 
3	Large-scale neurocognitive networks and distributed processing for attention, language, and memory. Cognition and comportment are subserved by interconnected neural networks that allow high-level computational architectures including parallel distributed processing. Cognitive problems are not resolved by a sequential and hierarchical progression toward predetermined goals but instead by a simultaneous and interactive consideration of multiple possibilities and constraints until a satisfactory fit is achieved. The resultant texture of mental activity is characterized by almost infinite richness and flexibility. According to this model, complex behavior is mapped at the level of multifocal neural systems rather than specific anatomical sites, giving rise to brain-behavior relationships that are both localized and distributed. Each network contains anatomically addressed channels for transferring information content and chemically addressed pathways for modulating behavioral tone. This approach provides a blueprint for reexploring the neurological foundations of attention, language, memory, and frontal lobe function. 
2	Gastroesophageal reflux disease: an update on management. Gastroesophageal reflux is commonplace; all humans experience it. For many patients, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a manageable condition. For others, GERD can progress to severe symptoms, inflammation, and disruption of the mucosal lining. Effective therapy calls for a clear understanding of the pathogenesis of GERD. The final common denominator to GERD is a lower esophageal sphincter mechanism that relaxes or is incompetent and allows gastroesophageal reflux to occur. Key factors associated with GERD are (a) gastric content, (b) potency of refluxate, (c) esophageal clearance, (d) tissue resistance, and (e) disruption of the anatomic hiatus. GERD is generally a chronic condition characterized by recurrent symptoms. Treatment goals for the GERD patient need to be defined: is therapy directed toward eliminating the symptoms or is therapy designed to eliminate gastroesophageal reflux? Unfortunately, effective therapy for GERD usually does not affect the mechanism(s) underlying the problem. The broad goals of therapy in GERD are to decrease gastroesophageal reflux and neutralize it, to enhance esophageal clearance, and to protect esophageal mucosa. The therapeutic modalities related to each of these situations are numerous and overlap, but treatment strategies for managing the GERD patient can be used in clinical "stages" or as the clinical situation dictates. H2-receptor antagonist therapy has become the "keystone" in management of GERD. Unfortunately, not all GERD patients respond to conventional H2-receptor antagonist dosage treatment; high-dose H2-receptor antagonist therapy recently has been demonstrated to be more effective in a greater number of GERD patients with severe esophagitis. 
4	Factors determining improvement in left ventricular function after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction: primacy of baseline ejection fraction. Improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction is a measure of salvage of ischemic myocardium after reperfusion therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The degree of improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction may be influenced by many factors. Therefore, 137 patients in whom paired radionuclide angiograms were obtained within 24 h of acute infarction and before hospital discharge were retrospectively evaluated to determine which factors most affect improvement in ejection fraction. Only baseline ejection fraction correlated significantly with improvement in ejection fraction by both univariate analysis (ejection fraction as a continuous variable; p less than 0.001; ejection fraction as a categorical variable, less than or equal to 45% versus greater than 45%, p less than 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (p less than 0.0001). Reperfusion status (patent versus occluded infarct artery) and extent of coronary artery disease (one, two or three vessel) were significant factors by multivariate but not by univariate analysis. Location of infarction, treatment modality and time to treatment did not correlate with change in ejection fraction by either statistical technique. Thus, of those factors tested, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction is the most potent predictor of improvement in ventricular function after acute infarction. Knowledge of baseline ejection fraction may be helpful in deciding whether to treat some patients with equivocal indications or contraindications for reperfusion therapy. Clinical trials of reperfusion strategies should stratify patients on the basis of baseline ejection fraction if ejection fraction is to be used as an end point for myocardial salvage. 
3	Handcuff neuropathies Compressive neuropathy due to tight application of handcuffs occurred in 5 patients. The superficial radial nerve was affected in 8 hands and the median nerve in two. Neurologic deficits persisted as long as 3 years after handcuffing. Nerve conduction studies helped to exclude malingering and other diagnoses. All patients had been intoxicated when handcuffed or had been arrested with force. The handcuff mechanism, which allows accidental overtightening after application, is an unrecognized factor in these neuropathies. 
5	Caffeine and ventricular arrhythmias. An electrophysiological approach. Little information is known regarding caffeine's effect on the substrate supporting sustained ventricular arrhythmias. This prospective study evaluated the effect of coffee (275 mg of caffeine) on this substrate with programmed ventricular stimulation in 22 patients with a history of symptomatic nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation. Patients underwent electrophysiological testing before and 1 hour after coffee ingestion. Mean (+/- SEM) plasma caffeine level achieved after coffee consumption was 6.2 +/- 0.5 mg/L. Mean plasma catecholamine and potassium values were not altered significantly 1 hour following caffeine ingestion. The number of extrastimuli required to induce an arrhythmia was unchanged in 10 patients (46%), increased in six (27%), and decreased in six (27%). Rhythm severity was unchanged in 17 patients (77%), more severe in two (9%), and less severe in three (14%). In those patients with clinical ventricular arrhythmias, caffeine did not significantly alter inducibility or severity of arrhythmias, suggesting little effect on the substrate supporting ventricular arrhythmias. 
1	Use of gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging for differentiating mucoceles from neoplasms in the paranasal sinuses. The purpose of this study was to determine whether additional clinically useful information could be obtained from gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging compared with the information obtained from nonenhanced MR imaging and computed tomography (CT). Therefore, the authors selected 41 patients, whose results at CT examinations demonstrated a variety of pathologic conditions of the paranasal sinuses, to undergo MR imaging both with and without the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine for contrast enhancement. In 22 of 35 cases of neoplasms and mucoceles occurring separately, the lesions were correctly differentiated by established MR signal criteria alone. However, 32 of these 35 cases were accurately differentiated when gadolinium-enhanced MR images were obtained. Six cases demonstrated co-existing neoplasm and mucocele: Gadolinium-enhanced MR enabled correct differentiation of five of these lesions, while unenhanced MR enabled correct differentiation of three. On the basis of these results, the authors conclude that the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine for contrast enhancement at MR imaging is useful for differentiating mucoceles from neoplasms in the sinonasal tract. 
4	Role of prostaglandin E1 in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance in an experimental model of acute lung injury. To determine the role and efficacy of prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) on the cardiopulmonary derangements induced by glass bead embolism, two studies were performed. In the first study, a dose response of PGE1 was tested in six animals that were first embolized with sufficient glass beads to double the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). This study demonstrated that PGE1 reduced PAP and cardiac output by a preload-mediated mechanism, as evidenced by a reduction in the right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic segment length, at doses of 15 and 30 ng/kg.min. The second study was performed in two groups of animals, the control group (n = 6), and the treated group (n = 6), which were given PGE1 at 15 ng/kg.min after the PAP had been doubled by glass bead embolism. RV preload was kept constant. This study demonstrated that there was no difference in pulmonary vascular resistance between either the treated group or the control group. There were no other significant differences between the two groups. The results of both of these studies suggest that there is little afterload reducing effect of PGE1 in this model and at these dose ranges. Part of the mechanism of PGE1 that improves pulmonary edema and gas exchange may be the reduction of filtration surface area and hydrostatic pressures in the lungs. 
4	Influence of obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and NIDDM on LDL structure and composition. Possible link between hyperinsulinemia and atherosclerosis. The possible causes of the enhanced risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) were examined in morbidly obese women with normoglycemia, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) before and after gastric bypass surgery. Compared with age-matched lean women, plasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations of the obese women before surgery favored atherogenesis. The risk for CHD may further be exacerbated in the IGT and NIDDM groups by the prevalence of smaller and denser low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) particles. LDL size correlated negatively with plasma insulin levels independent of triglyceride levels, age, or body mass index (BMI). After surgery, BMI, plasma insulin, and triglyceride levels decreased, but LDL size increased, and LDL density decreased. Neither cholesterol nor LDL cholesterol levels were affected after surgery, but high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol was increased in all patients after surgery. Although the mechanisms underlying the changes in the properties of LDL could not be determined from this study, these changes appear to be of benefit in reducing CHD risk in these patients. 
5	Headache: a marker of depression Patients who presented with a chief complaint of headache in the outpatient family practice setting were found to have a high prevalence of depression (63%) by the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) index. A statistically significant relationship was found between the frequency of headaches (P = .03) with level of depression. In fact, 74% of patients with headaches recurring almost every day had a clinically significant depression diagnosed as defined by the Zung SDS score. The Zung SDS score also correlated with the length of time that the problem of headache existed (P less than .05). Item analysis of the individual 20-item depression score revealed that four questions accounted for 93% of the variance. This analysis suggests that shorter, more abbreviated screening questions could be developed and refined in the future for use by the busy clinician. Headache is an important marker for depression in the primary care setting. It can be inferred from this study that the clinician may need to focus more on treating the entity of depression than on treating just the symptom of headache. 
5	Valve replacement in patients with endocarditis and cerebral septic emboli. Cerebral septic emboli complicate the cases in 20% to 40% of patients with left-sided endocarditis but the management of these patients who require a valvar operation remains unclear. From 1980 to 1988, the incidence of cerebral septic embolus was 42% (n = 45) among 106 patients with endocarditis who underwent valve replacement at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. Of these 45 patients, 69% (n = 31) had symptomatic cerebral septic infarctions and 31% (n = 14) were asymptomatic. Findings on cerebral computed tomographic scans included ischemic infarcts (n = 36, 80%), hemorrhagic infarcts (n = 5, 11%), normal studies (n = 2, 4%), and unknown (n = 2, 4%). Neurological complications after valve replacement included postoperative strokes (n = 6, 6%), cerebral abscesses (n = 2, 2%), and seizure (n = 1, 1%). The presence of a hemorrhagic infarct preoperatively predisposed to a perioperative stroke (p less than 0.05). In conclusion, cerebral septic infarctions, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, are common among patients with endocarditis referred for valvar operation. In the absence of a hemorrhagic infarct, valve replacement can be performed with minimal risk of a perioperative stroke. 
1	Preoperative superselective arteriolar embolization: a new approach to enhance resectability of spinal tumors. The extent of surgical resection of spinal tumors is frequently limited by blood loss and technical difficulty associated with the vascularity of the tumors. We report here the use of superselective percutaneous arterial embolization to reduce the rate of blood loss at the time of surgical resection and enhance resectability. The types of tumors treated were metastatic renal carcinoma, metastatic thyroid carcinoma, metastatic melanoma, and giant cell tumor of the sacrum. Two of the patients required repeated embolization and surgery for recurrent symptoms. The estimated blood loss in seven of nine procedures performed on the six patients ranged from 300 to 800 ml, after which no transfusion was required. In two procedures, extensive resection of very large tumors resulted in larger losses of blood, and postoperative transfusion was necessary. No significant complications of embolization or surgery occurred. A key factor in our embolization technique is the use of microfibrillar collagen, which allows occlusion of tumor vessels as small as 20 microns and may prevent reconstitution of the embolized vessels by collateral flow. We conclude that preoperative arterial embolization enhances the resectability of a variety of spinal tumors by reducing intraoperative blood loss. This may provide an additional benefit by reducing the risk related to postoperative transfusion. By permitting a more aggressive surgical approach, the use of preoperative embolization also has the potential to improve outcome in patients with spinal tumors. 
1	Treatable abdominal pathologic conditions and unsuspected malignant neoplasms at autopsy in veterans who received mechanical ventilation. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine, in medical patients who received mechanical ventilation, the frequency and types of major unexpected diagnoses at autopsy that, if known before death, would probably have led to improved survival (class I errors) or substantively changed management but not survival (class IIB errors). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Six medical intensive care units in a Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-two autopsied patients of the 401 veterans who received mechanical ventilation and died in the hospital. RESULTS: The class I error rate was 12%. Abdominal pathologic conditions--abscesses, bowel perforations, or infarction--were as frequent as pulmonary emboli as a cause of class I errors. While patients with abdominal pathologic conditions generally complained of abdominal pain, results of examination of the abdomen were considered unremarkable in most patients, and the symptom was not pursued. Six percent of patients had extensive malignant neoplasms (class IIB errors). CONCLUSIONS: Atypical presentation of potentially treatable abdominal pathologic conditions is a common cause of class I errors in veterans who receive mechanical ventilation. Conversely, several patients with unrecognized terminal conditions underwent intensive intervention. If the information gained at autopsy had been known before death, management would have probably changed substantively in 18% of patients. 
4	Aneurysmal dilatation in saphenous vein bypass grafts. Three patients are reported who developed aneurysmal degeneration of a saphenous vein arterial bypass graft. All three had hypercholesterolemia and two had marked elevation of triglycerides. One bypass was for occlusive disease and two for popliteal aneurysm. There was a long lag, 3 to 7 years between graft implantation and aneurysmal degeneration. The pathology was similar for all three cases with lipid laden macrophages, loss of elastic lamina, and other atherosclerotic changes in the vein wall. While atheromatous changes and aneurysm formation in saphenous vein bypass grafts are rare, this may occur especially in patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Careful and prolonged follow-up plus vigorous management of the hyperlipidemic state is mandatory in these patients. 
4	Rupture of atheromatous plaque as a cause of thrombotic occlusion of stenotic internal carotid artery. We analyzed the clinical profiles and autopsy findings of five patients who died shortly after developing cerebral infarction following thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery. In all five cases, thrombotic occlusion was caused by rupture of the fibrous lining over the gruel of atheroma at the origin of the internal carotid artery showing tight stenosis of the lumen. The mean +/- SD shorter diameter of the lumen at the site of occlusion was 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm. Our results show that an internal carotid artery with tight stenosis of the lumen by atheroma containing gruel harbors a risk of thrombotic occlusion, which may give rise to cerebral infarction by artery-to-artery embolism or by reduced cerebral perfusion. 
5	Effects of hypothyroidism on bronchial reactivity in non-asthmatic subjects. The effect of hypothyroidism on non-specific bronchial reactivity was studied in 11 patients without pulmonary disease (mean age 40 (SD 13) years) who had had a total thyroidectomy and radioiodine treatment for thyroid cancer 41 (36) months before the study. All patients when mildly hyperthyroid while having long term thyroxine replacement treatment and once when hypothyroid two weeks after stopping triiodothyronine for the purpose of screening for metastases. Bronchial reactivity was assessed by measuring specific airways conductance (sGaw) after increasing doses of inhaled carbachol (45-1260 micrograms). The dose producing a 35% decrease in sGaw (PD35) was determined from the cumulative log dose-response curve by linear regression analysis. Mean baseline sGaw values were similar when the patients were hypothyroid and when they were hyperthyroid (1.35 (0.36) and 1.41 (0.56) s-1 kPa-1). The interstudy coefficients of variation of baseline sGaw were higher in the thyroid patients than in a euthyroid control group (14% versus 8%). Geometric mean PD35 was lower when the patients were hypothyroid (97 micrograms) than when they were mildly hyperthyroid (192 micrograms). It is concluded that acute hypothyroidism increases non-specific bronchial reactivity in nonasthmatic subjects. 
5	Site and strand specificity of UVB mutagenesis in the SUP4-o gene of yeast [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Mar 1;88(5):2035] DNA sequencing was used to characterize 208 mutations induced in the SUP4-o tRNA gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by UVB (285-320 nm) radiation. The results were compared to those for an analysis of 211 SUP4-o mutations induced by 254-nm UVC light. In each case, greater than 90% of the mutations were single base-pair changes but G.C----A.T transitions predominated and accounted for more of the mutations induced by UVB than UVC. Double substitutions, single base-pair deletions, and more complex events were also recovered. However, UVB induced 3-fold more tandem substitutions than UVC and nontandem double events were detected only after irradiation with UVC. Virtually all induced substitutions occurred at sites where the pyrimidine of the base pair was part of a dipyrimidine sequence. Although the site specificities were consistent with roles for cyclobutane dimers and pyrimidine-pyrimidone(6-4) lesions in mutation induction, preliminary photoreactivation data implicated cyclobutane dimers as the major form of premutational DNA damage for both agents. Intriguingly, there was a preference for both UVB- and UVC-induced mutations to occur at sites where the dipyrimidine was on the transcribed strand. 
5	Psychosocial correlates of temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction. This study examines psychological differences between temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction (TMJPD) patients, pain controls, and healthy controls. Two hundred and two patients were classified, according to the diagnostic criteria of Eversole and Machado, as either myogenic facial pain (n = 42), internal derangement type I (n = 69), internal derangement type II (n = 85), or internal derangement type III (n = 6). Patients completed the Basic Personality Inventory, the Illness Behavior Questionnaire, the Multidimensional Health Locus of Control, the Perceived Stress Scale, and the Ways of Coping Checklist. Subjects also answered question pertaining to TMJPD symptomatology, including chronicity and severity. After conservative treatment with simple jaw exercise and ultrasound, patients were contacted again at 5 months to complete follow-up questionnaires similar to those previously completed. Comparison groups were comprised of 79 patients attending outpatient physiotherapy clinics for pain-related injuries not involving the temporomandibular joint and 71 pain-free, healthy students. Data were analyzed using multivariate statistics. The results indicate a significant relationship between pain intensity (and to some extent chronicity) and diverse measures of personality among the pain controls but not among the TMJPD patients. This calls into question the validity of assuming individual pain disorders are subsets of a larger, homogenous pain disorder population. TMJPD patients and pain controls score higher on hypochondriasis and anxiety than the pain-free controls but these elevations are not clinically significant. The elevations decrease to normal levels in response to a positive treatment outcome. There were no differences between the TMJPD patients and the pain controls on any of the measures. These results suggests that TMJPD patients do not appear to be significantly different from other pain patients or healthy controls in personality type, response to illness, attitudes towards health care, or ways of coping with stress. 
2	Sexually transmitted arthritis syndromes. Sexually transmitted infections may provoke a wide variety of rheumatic lesions. Disseminated N. gonorrhoeae infection leads to septic arthritis, which may be rapidly destructive but which responds promptly to appropriate antibiotic therapy. In contrast, both gonococcal and nongonococcal infections may lead to aseptic "reactive" arthritis or Reiter's syndrome. Inheritance of HLA B27 confers a relative risk of 30 to 50 times for the development of this condition. The demonstration of C. trachomatis antigen in joint material from a minority of patients suggests that direct interaction between microbial components and class I HLA antigens in the joint may be central to the pathogenesis of this disease. Arthralgia and arthritis occur in up to 50% of individuals in the prodrome of hepatitis B infection. Joint symptoms may be accompanied by urticarial or cutaneous vasculitic lesions, especially on the legs; both features resolve with the onset of jaundice. Hepatitis B infection is also a major cause of necrotizing vasculitis, which may or may not be associated with overt hepatitis. Seronegative arthritis, including Reiter's syndrome, psoriatic arthritis, and undifferentiated arthritis, a Sjogren's-like syndrome, vasculitis, and myopathies have been described in association with HIV infection. It is clear that synovitis occurs in those patients despite the fact that HIV is present in immune cells within the joint during inflammatory arthritis and that both antigen presentation and lymphocyte responsiveness within the joint are impaired. Nevertheless, synovitis may occur in the presence of marked CD4-positive lymphocyte depletion. Rheumatic syndromes, including arthralgia, inflammatory arthritis, and neuropathic arthritis, may occur during any stage of congenital or acquired syphilis. Syphilitic synovitis responds well to antibiotic therapy, but neuropathic lesions cannot be treated effectively. Septic arthritis has rarely been described as a complication of disseminated Mycoplasma or Urea-plasma infections, and joint lesions sometimes associated with erythema nodosum have also been reported in lymphogranuloma venereum and granuloma inguinale. 
4	Thromboembolytic complications during circulatory assistance with a centrifugal pump in patients with valvular prostheses. This article describes two patients with artificial heart valves who suffered thromboembolytic complications during circulatory assistance using a Biomedicus centrifugal pump. The first case involved a 25-year-old man who presented acute blockage of a mechanical aortic valve. Emergency surgery was performed to replace this valve with a bioprosthesis. Postoperatively the patient developed severe left heart insufficiency and a Biomedicus centrifugal pump was placed between the left atrium and the ascending aorta. After 3 days of total left ventricular assistance, weaning was started and successfully completed with explanation on the 5th day. Two days later the patient died of multiple coronary embolism with thrombosis of the valve. The second case involved a 30-year-old man. Six months before, he underwent surgical procedure with placement of Bio-prosthesis for dissecting aortic aneurysm due to annuloectasia. Upon admission for terminal dilated myocardiopathy, the patient was in kidney failure almost requiring dialysis. Because of this patient's size (Marfan syndrome), no donor heart was immediately available and left circulatory assistance with a Biomedicus pump had to be initiated. The patient lived without mechanical ventilation, in good clinical condition until day 23 when he presented acute right heart failure due to extensive valvular and coronary thrombosis. From these two cases, several important comments can be made about anticoagulation therapy, partial unloading of left ventricle, or need for biventricular assistance, and efficiency of centrifugal devices in these clinical applications. 
1	Multiple myeloma and bullous lichenoid lesions: an unusual association. Many associations of lichenoid reactions have been described but this case appears to be a previously unreported association--with multiple myeloma. This case also demonstrates the necessity of a mucosal biopsy with adequate hematologic and serologic investigations to obtain a definitive diagnosis. 
5	An unusual late complication following surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot. A case is presented of extrusion of right ventricular outflow tract patch material through a mediastino-cutaneous fistula occurring five years after repair of tetralogy of Fallot. The focus of the mediastinal infection was an infected epicardial pacemaker electrode placed at the time of initial surgery. Subsequent echocardiographic studies showed minimal right ventricular outflow tract or pulmonary arterial dilatation, and, with no further surgery, the child is well after two and a half years follow-up. 
5	Relative validity of self-reported snoring as a symptom of sleep apnea in a sleep clinic population The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relative validity of responses to three different questions about snoring as indicators for sleep apnea in a population referred to a sleep clinic. Secondary goals were to evaluate the meaning of a "don't know" response to these questions and to examine how the associations between snoring and sleep apnea are influenced by demographics. Results from 1,409 patients in a sleep clinic indicated that nearly all levels of estimated snoring frequency were associated with a greater likelihood of sleep apnea. In addition, a "don't know" response indicated a likelihood of sleep apnea. In the sample from this clinic, sensitivities approximating 90 percent were obtained in men, and specificities approximating 90 percent were obtained in women, but high diagnostic accuracy (high specificity in men; high sensitivity in women) could not be achieved with the three snoring questions used here. Generally, associations between snoring and sleep apnea were independent of age and sex. Single persons, persons living alone, and persons customarily sleeping alone of both sexes all showed associations between self-reported snoring and the presence of sleep apnea. 
5	Uses and complications of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty. Uvulopalatopharygoplasty has become widely performed for chronic snoring and for cases of obstructive sleep apnoea. Unfortunately this operation is not without morbidity and complications. We report our results of a prospective series of 50 patients undergoing uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with a minimum follow-up of one year. Snoring was abolished in 18 (36 per cent) and substantially reduced in the remainder. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome, identified in 11 patients pre-operatively, was reduced in severity in all but three. Troublesome complications were seen in 18 (36 per cent) patients, namely intermittent velopharyngeal incompetence in five (10 per cent), pharyngeal dryness in 11 (22 per cent) and loss of taste in five (10 per cent). One patient had nasopharyngeal stenosis requiring correction. A cautious approach to this operation is required with rigorous case selection. The importance of full assessment and careful follow-up should not be underestimated. 
3	Major histocompatibility complex antigen expression in the affected tissues in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Monoclonal antibody immunocytochemistry was used to examine spinal cord and muscle in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for changes that would indicate ongoing or potential immune activity. Increased expression of class I and II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was seen in the affected areas of spinal cord. New MHC expression was concentrated in phagocytes, particularly in degenerating white matter in which they were dispersed in the tissue and also packed around blood vessels. MHC antigen was not revealed in motor neurons or skeletal muscle fibers. An anti-pan-T-cell monoclonal revealed small numbers of T cells in degenerating white matter. Similar changes have been seen in other neurodegenerative disorders. They suggest a potential for (secondary) cell-mediated activity in the affected areas rather than an ongoing MHC-restricted T-cell response. Vessel-associated phagocytes may be a source of antigen to peripheral lymphoid tissue, stimulating production of the autoantibodies that have been described. 
5	The changing direction of nystagmus in acute Meniere's disease: pathophysiological implications. The direction(s) and pathophysiologic basis of nystagmus during an acute attack of Meniere's disease have been subject to much debate in the world literature. Clinical recordings from two patients whose nystagmus was captured near the very beginning of the acute vertiginous episode are presented. Previous clinical observations in Meniere's disease, experimental animal models concerned with initiation of peripheral nystagmus, and the phenomenon of recovery are discussed. 
5	Pancreatic cancer versus chronic pancreatitis: diagnosis with CA 19-9 assessment, US, CT, and CT-guided fine-needle biopsy. The authors prospectively performed serum CA 19-9 assessment, ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT), and CT-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of the pancreas in 81 consecutive patients with suspected chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic neoplasm. The final diagnosis was pancreatic cancer in 54 patients and chronic pancreatitis in 27 patients. CA 19-9 assessment, US, CT, and FNAB were considered nondiagnostic, respectively, in 0%, 25%, 19%, and 6% of cases. When a definite diagnosis was rendered, the positive predictive value was 90% for CA 19-9 assessment, 95% for US, 98% for CT, and 100% for FNAB; the negative predictive value was, respectively, 69%, 95%, 86%, and 100%. The accuracy of all diagnostic and nondiagnostic studies was 81% for CA 19-9 assessment, 72% for US, 77% for CT, and 94% for FNAB. It is concluded that CT-guided pancreatic FNAB is the most reliable examination for enabling differential diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis. When the pancreas is well visualized at US, the negative predictive value for pancreatic cancer is more accurate than that of CA 19-9 assessment and CT. 
2	Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal. Progress in the prognosis of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal has followed the use of multimodality therapy. From 1977 to 1985, 42 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal were treated with mitomycin C (15 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m2) on day 1, 5-FU (750 mg/m2/d) alone on days 2 to 5, and radiation therapy (3000 cGy) on days 7 to 28. They were evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after completion of the chemotherapy/radiation therapy protocol and received local excision, abdominoperineal resection, or both. Patient follow-up times ranged from 7 to 161 months, with a mean follow-up time of 71 months. Pathologic examination showed no residual carcinoma in 19 (45%) patients. The authors could not predict, based on clinical evaluation, which patients would have a complete response. Of the patients with a complete clinical response, 44% had tumor in the pathology specimen. Wide local excision was the most common initial operation (23 of 42 patients; 55%), with five of these patients subsequently requiring abdominoperineal resection. Anal continence was retained in 18 of 42 (43%) patients. Eleven patients experienced recurrent disease: six local recurrences, one distant, and four both local and distant. The 5-year overall survival rate was 82% and the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 87%. There were no treatment related deaths. Preoperative tumor size was the only factor significantly related to survival. Contrary to other reports, tumor in the pathology specimen did not adversely affect long-term survival. Hence, patients should be treated after chemotherapy/radiation therapy with surgical therapy sufficient to control local disease. 
2	Biliobiliary fistula: preoperative diagnosis and management implications. Experience with cholecystohepaticodochal and cholecystocholedochal fistulas as a result of an erosion of gallstones from the gallbladder into the adjacent common duct in five patients is presented. The incidence was 1.4% in a population of 350 patients undergoing cholecystectomy. The condition was indicated clinically on the basis of a symptom triad of jaundice, fever, and pain with cholelithiasis in a small contracted gallbladder. In addition, proximal intra- and extrahepatic ductal dilatation, calculus in the common duct, and normal-caliber (or unprofiled) distal common duct on ultrasound scan were present in all the patients. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography proved to be the most useful means of investigation, and it confirmed the diagnosis in four patients before surgery. A modified antegrade cholecystectomy was performed with the gallbladder opened inferiorly at the fundus, and the stones were evacuated. A partial cholecystectomy and choledochoplasty were accomplished with gallbladder flaps whenever feasible. Other useful operative procedures are side-to-side hepaticodochojejunostomy and hepaticodochoduodenostomy. In the presence of high benign bile duct stricture, an approach to the left hepatic duct is now preferred for biliary bypass. 
1	Unresectable calcified bladder tumor: hemiacidrin irrigation as an adjunct to resection. Radiographic calcification of urothelial malignancies is an uncommon finding. To our knowledge, calcification of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder preventing transurethral resection has not been reported previously. We report a case of an initially unresectable radiopaque bladder tumor and discuss the successful, conservative management with continuous bladder irrigation with hemiacidrin followed by complete transurethral resection. 
2	Ulcerative colitis disease activity as subjectively assessed by patient-completed questionnaires following orthotopic liver transplantation for sclerosing cholangitis. To assess whether or not liver transplantation and subsequent immunosuppression with cyclosporine and prednisone affect ulcerative colitis symptomatology, we surveyed by questionnaire all 23 surviving patients with pretransplant colonoscopy-documented ulcerative colitis who were transplanted for primary sclerosing cholangitis between June 1982 and September 1985. At follow-up [89.8 +/- 7.6 weeks (mean +/- SEM], all six patients who had had asymptomatic colonoscopy-documented ulcerative colitis reported continued ulcerative colitis quiescence. Among the 17 patients who had had symptomatic colonoscopy-documented ulcerative colitis at time of liver transplantation, 88.2% reported improvement in overall ulcerative colitis severity (P less than 0.001), with significant improvement in the frequency of bowel movements reported by 100%, in crampy abdominal pain by 87.5%, in bowel urgency by 75%, in the occurrence of pus or mucus in stool by 87.5%, in the incidence of ulcerative colitis flares by 81.8%, and in the number of days unable to function normally due to ulcerative colitis symptoms by 78.6% (all at least P less than 0.01). These data demonstrate that ulcerative colitis symptom severity significantly improves following liver transplantation with immunosuppression with cyclosporine and prednisone. 
1	Forty years of neuroglycopenia: neuropsychiatry for the internist. The case of a 65-year-old patient with an insulin-secreting pancreatic tumour and a 40-year history of neuropsychiatric disease is reported. The physiopathology and clinical features of acute, subacute, and chronic neuroglycopenia in patients with endogenous insulin hypersecretion are discussed. 
3	Endosalpingosis as a cause of chronic pelvic pain. Endosalpingosis, a condition characterized by ectopic oviduct epithelium, is diagnosed histologically by the appearance of benign ciliated and nonciliated columnar cells in an abnormal location. Endosalpingosis is typically without symptoms. Our unusual case report shows symptomatic endosalpingosis first seen with chronic pelvic pain. Various aspects of this disease will also be discussed. 
5	Fludarabine: a new agent with marked cytoreductive activity in untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thirty-three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with advanced Rai stage (III-IV) or progressive Rai stage (0-II) disease were treated with fludarabine as a single agent. Eleven patients (33%) obtained a complete remission (CR), 13 (39%) a clinical CR with residual nodules as the only evidence of disease (nodular partial remission [PR]), and two patients (6%) achieved a PR for a total response rate of 79%. Response was rapid, usually occurring after three to six courses of treatment. The major morbidity was infection. Febrile episodes occurred in 13% of the courses (pneumonia 6%, minor infection 4%, and transient fever of undocumented cause 3%). Fludarabine appears to be the most cytoreductive single agent so far studied in CLL. 
1	Intrahepatic lymphatics opacified during hepatic arteriography in a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrahepatic lymph node metastases are not uncommon in advanced cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is the account of a HCC case in which intrahepatic lymphatics running toward the hepatic hilus were clearly opacified during hepatic arteriography. The patient was treated by hepatic artery embolization followed by selective embolization of the portal branches, but lymph node metastases at the hepatic hilus were later found during follow-up. The clinical course of this case suggests that the communication between the tumor and the lymphatics was responsible for the lymph node metastasis. 
1	Multimodal therapy for the management of primary, nonmetastatic Ewing's sarcoma of bone: a long-term follow-up of the First Intergroup study. A total of 342 previously untreated eligible children were entered into the first Intergroup Ewing's Sarcoma Study (IESS) between May 1973 and November 1978. In group I institutions, patients were randomized between treatment 1 (radiotherapy to primary lesion plus cyclophosphamide, vincristine, dactinomycin, and Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH] [VAC plus ADR]) or treatment 2 (same as treatment 1 without ADR), and group II institutions randomized patients between treatment 2 or treatment 3 (same as treatment 2 plus bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy [VAC plus BPR]). The percentages of patients relapse-free and surviving (RFS) at 5 years for treatments 1, 2, and 3 were 60%, 24%, and 44%, respectively. There was strong statistical evidence of a significant advantage in RFS for treatment 1 (VAC plus ADR) versus 2 (VAC alone) (P less than .001) and 3 (P less than .05) and also of treatment 3 versus 2 (P less than .001). Similar significant results were observed with respect to overall survival. Patients with disease at pelvic sites have significantly poorer survival at 5 years than those with disease at nonpelvic sites (34% v 57%; P less than .001). Among pelvic cases, there was no evidence of differing survival by treatment (P = .81), but among nonpelvic cases, there was strong evidence of differing survival by treatment (P less than .001). The overall percentage of patients developing metastatic disease was 44%; the percentages by treatments 1, 2, and 3 were 30%, 72%, and 42%, respectively. The overall incidence of local recurrence was 15%, and there was no evidence that local recurrence rate differed by treatment. Patient characteristics related to prognosis, both with respect to RFS and overall survival experience, were primary site (nonpelvic patients were most favorable) and patient age (younger patients were more favorable). 
5	L-tyrosine potentiates the anorexia induced by mixed-acting sympathomimetic drugs in hyperphagic rats. The effects of L-tyrosine (L-TYR) on the anorectic activity of several mixed-acting sympathomimetics were determined during the dark cycle in rats made hyperphagic by food deprivation. L-TYR (200 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the anorectic activity of phenylpropanolamine, (-)-ephedrine and (+)-amphetamine by 48, 50 and 37%, respectively. When the dose of L-TYR was varied (25-400 mg/kg), a significant dose-dependent relationship was noted. The observed potentiation was positively correlated with increases in brain TYR concentrations; blockade of L-TYR uptake into the brain by the coadministration of L-valine prevented this potentiation. Various other L-amino acids, as well as D-TYR, failed to mimic the potentiating action of L-TYR. As determined by alpha-methyl-p-TYR pretreatment, the L-TYR-induced potentiation was dependent upon increased catecholamine synthesis. Although various other mixed-acting sympathomimetic anorexiants were similarly potentiated by L-TYR, the direct-acting beta-2 adrenoceptor anorexiants, salbutamol and methoxyphenamine, were not. These results indicate that L-TYR specifically potentiates the anorectic activity of the studied mixed-acting sympathomimetics and are consistent with the requirement of the central conversion of L-TYR to catecholamines via TYR hydroxylase for this response. The possibility that the effect of mixed-acting sympathomimetics is normally limited by the availability of L-TYR is suggested. 
1	Epstein-Barr virus small nuclear RNAs are not expressed in permissively infected cells in AIDS-associated leukoplakia. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA structure and gene expression were analyzed in tissue specimens from oral hairy leukoplakia (HLP), a mucocutaneous lesion that develops in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The structure of the terminal restriction enzyme fragments of EBV revealed that HLP is a permissive infection without a predominant, detectable population of EBV episomal DNA. In RNA preparations from this uniquely permissive infection, EBV replicative mRNAs could be identified by Northern analysis; however, the virally encoded small nuclear RNAs, the EBERs, were not detected in most HLP RNA preparations. In situ hybridization detected EBER expression in very rare cells. These data indicate that unlike other viral small nuclear RNAs, the EBERs are not expressed during viral replication and must participate in the complex maintenance of latent EBV infection. 
5	Heterogeneity in progressive aphasia due to focal cortical atrophy. A clinical and PET study. Six patients with a slowly progressive aphasic disorder due to degenerative cortical disease are reported. The length of history varied from 18 months to 6 years. In 5 patients, there was a naming deficit, associated in 4 of these with some abnormalities in comprehension. One patient had a progressive history of reduced speech output, which was associated with an orofacial dyspraxia. All patients were studied neuropsychologically, and in addition regional cerebral metabolism was measured using position emission tomography. A localized left hemisphere deficit was found in all patients except 1, who had the longest history and the most profound clinical deficit, and who also had right hemisphere hypometabolism. The major brunt of the deficit was in the anterior portion of the left temporal lobe in all but 1 case, the patient with poor speech output who had a more severe left posterior frontal deficit. These findings suggest that in progressive aphasia due to focal cortical atrophy there is heterogeneity in the clinical presentation and anatomical site of the deficit, with possible implications for the underlying aetiology. 
4	Deficiencies of coagulation-inhibiting and fibrinolytic proteins in outpatients with deep-vein thrombosis BACKGROUND. Isolated deficiencies of antithrombin III, protein C, protein S, and plasminogen have been implicated as a cause of deep-vein thrombosis. It is assumed that patients with recurrent, familial, or juvenile thrombosis are very likely to have such a deficiency. METHODS. We studied the prevalence of isolated deficiencies of these proteins in 277 consecutive outpatients with venographically proved acute deep-vein thrombosis, as compared with 138 age-matched and sex-matched controls without deep-vein thrombosis, and calculated the positive predictive value of a history of recurrent, familial, or juvenile venous thromboembolism for the presence of such a deficiency. RESULTS. The overall prevalence of deficiencies of any of these proteins in the patients with venous thrombosis was 8.3 percent (23 of 277 patients) (95 percent confidence interval, 5.4 to 12.4), as compared with 2.2 percent in the controls (3 of 138 subjects) (95 percent confidence interval, 0.5 to 6.1; P less than 0.05 for the comparison between groups). The positive predictive values for the presence of an isolated protein deficiency in patients with recurrent, familial, or juvenile deep-vein thrombosis, defined as the proportion of patients with the clinical finding who had a deficiency of one or more of the proteins, were 9, 16, and 12 percent, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. The cause of acute venous thrombosis in most outpatients (91.7 percent) cannot be explained by abnormalities of coagulation-inhibiting and fibrinolytic proteins. The information obtained from the medical history concerning recurrent or familial venous thrombosis or the onset of the disease at a young age is not useful for the identification of patients with protein deficiencies. 
1	Insulin-like growth factor II-mediated proliferation of human neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumor that typically arises in cells of the developing adrenal medulla. IGF-II mRNA is expressed at high levels in the adrenal cortex before birth but it is not detectable until after birth in the adrenal medulla. Neuroblastoma cell lines corresponding to early adrenal medullary precursors did not express IGF-II, although all three cell lines we tested were growth stimulated by IGF-II. Cell lines corresponding to more mature adrenal medullary cells expressed IGF-II, and one, SK-N-AS, grows by an IGF-II autocrine mechanism (J. Clin. Invest. 84:829-839) El-Badry, Romanus, Helman, Cooper, Rechler, and Israel. 1989. An examination of human neuroblastoma tumor tissues for IGF-II gene expression using in situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that IGF-II is expressed by tumor cells in only 5 of 21 neuroblastomas, but is detectable in cells of nonmalignant tissues including adrenal cortical cells, stromal fibroblasts, and eosinophils in all 21 tumors. These findings indicate that IGF-II may function as an autocrine growth factor for some neuroblastomas and as a paracrine growth factor for others. They suggest that the growth regulatory pathways utilized by neuroblastoma mimic those used in the precursor cell type from which individual tumors arise. 
5	Endoscopic ethmoidectomy and maxillary antrostomy in immunodeficient patients. The efficacy of endoscopic sinus surgery was evaluated in 11 patients with diverse types of primary immunodeficiency disease and symptoms of chronic sinusitis. The postoperative symptoms and ability to eliminate antibiotics were used as outcome parameters. In two patients, the follow-up time was too short to assess therapeutic effectiveness. Five of the remaining nine patients had total or significant resolution of symptoms. Patients with transient immunodeficiency had the best resolution of symptoms. Eight of the total 11 patients were treated with intravenous immunoglobulin preoperatively, and in five patients, the treatment was continued postoperatively. The ability to terminate gamma-globulin reflects not the success of the surgery, but the transient nature of some of the immunodeficiencies. 
3	Amebic meningoencephalitis in a patient with AIDS caused by a newly recognized opportunistic pathogen. Leptomyxid ameba. A fatal case of meningoencephalitis due to a leptomyxid ameba in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is presented. This opportunistic organism has not been previously recognized as a human pathogen. A 36-year-old male intravenous drug abuser died after an 18-day hospital course heralded by fever and headache and followed by nuchal rigidity and hemiparesis. Computed tomography of the head showed multiple hypodense lesions. Neuropathologic examination showed that in addition to human immunodeficiency virus encephalomyelitis, there was multifocal meningoencephalitis with trophozoites and cysts morphologically indistinguishable from those of Acanthamoeba. These organisms were also found in the kidneys and adrenal glands. By immunofluorescence, the parasites showed antigenic identity with a free-living leptomyxid ameba and failed to react with any of a spectrum of antiacanthamoeba antisera. This emphasizes the importance of immunofluorescence identification of morphologically indistinguishable ameba species. 
5	Dietary fats and oils in cardiac arrhythmia in rats. The effect of long-term feeding of various dietary fats and oils on cardiac arrhythmia was studied in an animal model of sudden cardiac death. After confirmation that a dietary supplement of saturated animal fat (SF) increased the animals' susceptibility to develop cardiac arrhythmia under ischemic stress whereas the polyunsaturated fatty acids of sunflower seed oil (SSO) reduced this susceptibility, we found that diets supplemented with either chemically refined palm oil (PO-I) or physically refined palm oil (PO-II) gave results that were generally intermediate in value between the SF and the SSO groups. However, during reperfusion of a previously ischemic heart, both PO-I- and PO-II-supplemented diets appeared to be as effective as SSO in reducing ventricular premature beats. In addition, the incidence of animals displaying severe ventricular fibrillation was much less after palm-oil feeding than it was after SF feeding. These preliminary results warrant further investigation of the potential antiarrhythmic effects of commercial palm oil. 
5	Acute osteomyelitis in children. Reassessment of etiologic agents and their clinical characteristics. One hundred thirty-five children with acute osteomyelitis were identified by chart review during a 7-year period, January 1, 1980, through December 31, 1986. Bacteriologic causes were detected in 75 (55%) of the patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were identified in 34 (25%), 16 (12%), and eight (6%) children, respectively. Staphylococcus aureus occurred in all age groups, H influenzae type b occurred only in children younger than 3 years and was the number one cause of disease in this group. Pseudomonas aeruginosa occurred exclusively in children older than 9 years. Children with H influenzae type b had clinical and laboratory findings that were almost indistinguishable from a matched group of children with osteomyelitis due to other known bacteria, although children with H influenzae type b tended to have more joint effusions (63% vs 27%), less lower extremity disease (22% vs 70%), and fewer positive cultures from bone or joint aspirates (41% vs 89%). Unlike most pediatric cases of osteomyelitis, the ones due to P aeruginosa did not represent the hematogenous route of infection; penetrating injury to the foot was present in every case. Children with P aeruginosa infections were older than 9 years (100%), predominantly male (88%), often afebrile (83%), and never bacteremic. These data provide guidelines for the initial work-up and management of osteomyelitis in children. 
1	The long-term effectiveness of hysteroscopic treatment of menorrhagia and leiomyomas. One hundred fifty-six of 177 patients admitted to the St. Luke's/Roosevelt Hospital Center between November 1973 and November 1988 for hysteroscopic treatment of menorrhagia and/or uterine leiomyomas were followed for long-term complications and necessity for repeat surgery. Ninety-four patients underwent submucous resection alone and 62 patients underwent endometrial ablation with or without submucous resection. Among the submucous-resection group, 24.5% reported late postoperative problems and 15.9% underwent further surgery. After 9 years of followup, 83.9% of the patients had not required further surgery. Among the ablation group, 22.5% experienced recurrence of increased bleeding and 8.1% had another surgical procedure. After 6 years of follow-up, 91.3% of the patients had not required further surgery. Twenty-one patients became pregnant after submucous resection, with 18 infants delivered. No patients who underwent endometrial ablation became pregnant. This modality of treatment appears to be effective over the long term, although effectiveness appears to diminish with time. 
1	The standardized assessment of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions in meningeal tumors. Tissue markers of cellular proliferation have been recently utilized as prognostic indicators in tumors of the central nervous system. Nucleolar organizer regions represent transcriptionally active sites of ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and can be identified by a simple argyrophilic technique. The authors describe a standardized approach to the assessment of these argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions in meningeal tumors. Twenty-five meningiomas were classified histologically into benign, atypical, or malignant groups. In addition, two hemangiopericytomas and one leptomeningeal melanoma were examined. Appropriate sections were silver stained and argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions were counted in 200 nuclei. The mean argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region count was statistically different (p less than 0.001) between benign tumors (245 +/- 156, 1.23/cell), atypical tumors (497 +/- 135, 2.49/cell), and malignant tumors (921 +/- 59, 4.61/cell). The count for recurrent meningiomas (544 +/- 76) was also statistically different (p less than 0.02) from non-recurrent tumors (329 +/- 183). The standardized assessment of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions can be easily performed by any surgical pathology laboratory without specialized equipment and, in meningeal tumors, may be useful as an independent indicator of biological behavior. 
1	Transrectal ultrasonography of rectal carcinoma. Preoperative transrectal ultrasonographic staging of 38 patients with known adenocarcinoma of the rectum was performed. Six of these patients had preoperative radiation therapy. Of the 32 without radiation therapy, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) correctly staged disease limited to the rectum in 90% (18 of 20) and transmural extension in 50% (6 of 12), for a sensitivity for evaluating transmural extension of 50%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 75%, and a negative predictive value of 25%. Nineteen patients had positive nodes. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting nodal metastases by TRUS were 63% and 85%. The positive and negative predictive values were 86% and 61%, respectively. TRUS was slightly superior to digital rectal examination in staging patients because of its superior ability to detect adenopathy. Adjacent organ involvement was correctly evaluated in five of six patients; peritumoral fibrosis was misinterpreted as tumor extension into uterus and ovary in one woman. Tumor shrinkage in all patients undergoing radiation therapy was identified, but fibrosis and edema made staging by TRUS unreliable in those patients. 
4	Evaluation of pulmonary arterial pressure by Doppler colour flow mapping in patients with a ductus arteriosus. Blood flow in the pulmonary artery was studied by Doppler colour flow mapping and cardiac catheterisation in 19 patients with a ductus arteriosus and different pulmonary artery pressures. In the four patients with normal pulmonary artery pressures colour Doppler flow mapping showed multicoloured wide and long systolic and diastolic jets in the pulmonary artery. In the 15 patients with raised pulmonary arterial pressure the systolic jets varied from multicoloured to red and were thinner: in patients with considerably raised pulmonary arterial pressure the jets became redder during diastole. The Doppler velocity tracings showed that in patients with normal pulmonary artery pressures the mean peak systolic velocity was higher than the mean end diastolic velocity--so that in all four the ratio of peak systolic velocity to end diastolic velocity was less than 2. The mean peak systolic velocity was much higher than the mean end diastolic velocity in 13 of the 15 patients with raised pulmonary artery pressure; this meant that the ratio of peak systolic velocity to end diastolic velocity was greater than 2 in 10 of 11 patients. The end diastolic velocity was significantly lower in those patients with raised pulmonary artery pressure than in those with normal artery pressure. There was an inverse linear correlation between the mean pulmonary artery pressure and end diastolic ductal jet velocity in 17 of the 19 patients. Colour flow mapping and this quantitative Doppler technique can detect pulmonary artery hypertension in patients with a ductus arteriosus. 
4	Studies of controlled reperfusion after ischemia. XXI. Reperfusate composition: superiority of blood cardioplegia over crystalloid cardioplegia in limiting reperfusion damage--importance of endogenous oxygen free radical scavengers in red blood cells. Postischemic damage is caused partially by oxygen free radical-mediated injury. This study will show that (1) crystalloid cardioplegia with room air oxygen is deleterious because it is devoid of free radical scavengers and (2) blood cardioplegia limits damage because it contains endogenous free radical scavengers in red blood cells. METHODS: Thirty-two dogs underwent 2 hours of ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 20 minutes of regional blood cardioplegic reperfusion on bypass. Ten dogs received only the blood cardioplegic solution (containing its endogenous free radical scavengers); five received initial blood cardioplegia (5 minutes) with endogenous free radical scavengers (catalase and glutathione peroxidase) blocked by aminotriazole and N-ethylmaleimide, respectively; 12 received initial crystalloid cardioplegic solution oxygenated by room air (oxygen tension = 150 mm Hg); seven without and five with exogenous free radical scavengers (superoxide dismutase, catalase, coenzyme Q10); five received initial deoxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution (oxygen tension = 6 mm Hg); and five received deoxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution. RESULTS: Blood cardioplegia with endogenous free radical scavengers produced the best recovery of systolic shortening (69% systolic shortening) and resulted in the least histochemical damage (11% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining). The worst recovery and most damage occurred if blood cardioplegia was preceded by oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia (3% systolic shortening, 48% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining; p less than 0.05 versus blood cardioplegia) or if free radical scavengers were blocked in the initial period of blood cardioplegia (3% systolic shortening, 41% triphenyltetrazolium chloride nonstaining; p less than 0.05 versus blood cardioplegia). Conversely, deoxygenation or supplementation of oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution with exogenous free radical scavengers restored 60% systolic shortening (p less than 0.05 versus oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia) and 54% systolic shortening (p less than 0.05 versus oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia) and reduced damage to 34% and 21% (both p less than 0.05 versus oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegia). CONCLUSION: Blood cardioplegic solutions containing their own endogenous free radical scavengers are superior to crystalloid cardioplegic solutions, because they limit oxygen-mediated perfusion damage and restore contractile function. Initial crystalloid cardioplegic washout negates the salutary effect of blood cardioplegia. Exogenous free radical scavenger supplementation or deoxygenation of the cardioplegic reperfusate is necessary only if crystalloid cardioplegia is used. 
5	Cecal diverticulitis presented as a cecal tumor. Seven patients diagnosed as having acute appendicitis were operated on and a cecal wall mass due to cecal diverticulitis was found. In two patients the mass could not be separated from the cecal wall and right colectomy was performed. In five patients, in whom the mass could be separated from the cecum, conservative operations (three diverticulectomies and two wedge resections) were performed, thus avoiding needless, more extensive surgery. 
5	Spirometric criteria for hospital admission of patients with acute exacerbation of COPD. Recent studies have demonstrated that there is a high relapse rate for patients discharged from the Emergency Department (ED) following treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Objective criteria have not been established to determine when to hospitalize these patients. This study evaluated spirometric criteria for that use. Eighty-three patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD were studied; 45 percent were admitted to the hospital while 17 percent of the patients who were discharged suffered a relapse. An FEV1 of less than 40 percent of predicted normal identified patients who required hospital admission or suffered a relapse with a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.58, and overall accuracy of 0.78. Combining clinical assessment with spirometry led to an improvement in specificity to 0.73 with a minimal decrease in sensitivity. Patients with an FEV1 of 40 percent or greater of predicted normal or no clinical evidence of respiratory distress after treatment may be safely discharged from the hospital. Patients not meeting these criteria are at high risk for relapse and should either be admitted or have further aggressive ED therapy. 
5	The use of Glisson's capsule flap in reduced orthotopic hepatic transplantation. The technique of graft reduction has increased the donor pool for children in need of orthotopic hepatic transplantation. However, this technique has been associated with increased perioperative blood loss. Further refinements, such as covering the cut surface of the donor hepatic duct with a flap of Glisson's capsule, may help reduce this complication. 
1	The importance of prognostic factors in the individual treatment of patients with disseminated germ cell tumours. Following chemotherapy for disseminated testicular cancer, 55 patients underwent surgery because of residual tumour. The histological findings were viable tumour in 12 patients, mature teratoma in 12 and fibrosis and/or necrosis in 31. Retroperitoneal abdominal masses were evaluated radiographically before and after chemotherapy. The reduction in size of these masses after chemotherapy appeared to have prognostic significance. A decrease of more than 70% was always associated with fibrosis. A residual mass over 50 mm indicated viable tumour or mature teratoma. Seminoma or embryonal carcinoma was more likely to result in fibrosis/necrosis in the resected tissue. Both the Indiana and the EORTC classification models can be used for prognosis. Radiographic measurements before and after chemotherapy are of considerable prognostic significance. These objective indicators help in planning treatment and so diminish the side effects of therapy and maintain or even increase the high cure rate in disseminated testicular cancer. 
2	Ultrasonography in patients with suspected acute appendicitis: a prospective study. The diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution real-time ultrasonography was prospectively studied in 240 patients admitted to the hospital with suspected acute appendicitis. The criteria for ultrasound diagnosis of appendicitis included a sausage-shaped, aperistaltic, hypoechoic structure when imaged along its longitudinal axis, with a target-like appearance on transverse section. The ultrasonographic findings were correlated with surgical-pathological outcome in 82 cases with proven appendicitis, with laparotomy findings in another 21 patients and with clinical follow-up in the remainder. The overall sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of ultrasonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis were 78%, 92% and 87%, respectively. The positive predictive value was 84% and the negative predictive value was 88%. Ultrasonography may significantly improve the diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute appendicitis and should be performed in all patients in whom the clinical diagnosis is equivocal. The ultrasonographic findings must be interpreted in light of the clinical findings. 
5	Cardiac conducting tissue. A simplified technique for examination of the SA and AV nodes. We describe a modified method for examination of the atrioventricular and sinoatrial nodes that displays the major elements of the cardiac conducting system, yet is not time-consuming for the technician. We examined 31 cases in three categories: cases with previous cardiac history, sudden deaths from no known cause, and cases where death was sudden and accidental. All cases showed histologic abnormalities in the cardiac tissue. We contend that our method would permit such examination to be routinely used in the pathology laboratory. 
2	Transduodenal sphincteroplasty with transampullary septectomy for stenosing papillitis. The papilla of Vater and its sphincter of Oddi, lying at the confluence of the bile and pancreatic ducts in man, have long been suspected as a source of upper abdominal pain. Enlarging the opening of the transpapillary segment of the bile and major pancreatic ducts by using a transduodenal sphincteroplasty with transampullary septectomy resulted in death in a patient with a peripapillary diverticulum and pancreas divisum. Eight-six patients followed for 1 to 10 years experienced a 75% success rate. Thirty-six patients had a marked stenosis of their duct of Wirsung, suggesting that their pain was primarily from the pancreas. The remainder had either a generalized narrowing (40 patients) or a normal (7 patients) papilla. Pain was not satisfactorily resolved in patients with an associated pancreas divisum, chronic pancreatitis, and recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis with alcoholism. 
4	Endocrine and renal effects of nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system in patients with essential hypertension. Results of a multicenter trial. The Modern Approach to the Treatment of Hypertension Study Group. Use of thiazide diuretics and beta-blockers in the treatment of hypertension may result in metabolic derangements and/or disturbances in the parameters of renal function, which offset the benefits of blood pressure reduction by adversely affecting other cardiovascular risk factors, particularly in special patient groups such as the elderly or those with concomitant diseases. Newer agents including calcium channel blockers, which exert potent antihypertensive effects without adversely affecting metabolic parameters unfavorably, are used with increasing frequency in hypertensive patients, but their clinical utility has been limited by the need for multiple daily dosing with attendant fluctuations in plasma levels thought to be associated with nuisance side effects and possible gaps in therapeutic protection. The Modern Approach to the Treatment of Hypertension (MATH) trial was conducted to determine the efficacy and safety of the new once-daily nifedipine gastrointestinal therapeutic system (GITS) formulation in a large cohort of mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients overall, and to identify specific effects of therapy in the presence of complicating factors such as diabetes and obesity. A total of 1155 patients from 127 centers were treated with nifedipine GITS in the MATH trial, including 157 diabetic (fasting plasma glucose greater than 120 mg/dL or on hypoglycemic therapy) and 747 nondiabetic patients. There were 458 obese patients (body mass index [BMI] greater than 30), 489 overweight patients (BMI greater than or equal to 25 less than or equal to 30), and 206 patients of normal weight (BMI less than 25). 
1	Axial myoclonus of propriospinal origin. Three patients are described with nonrhythmic repetitive axial myoclonic jerks causing symmetric flexion of the neck, trunk, hips and knees. No electrophysiological evidence of a cortical or brainstem reticular origin for the myoclonus was found. In the first patient the axial jerks only occurred spontaneously. The latencies of recruitment of spinal segments during a jerk indicated that the discharge arose in the mid thoracic cord and then slowly spread at about 5 ms-1 up and down the cord to involve rostral and caudal segments. No structural lesion was identified in this patient. In the second patient spontaneous and reflex axial jerks developed following the excision of a cervical haemangioblastoma. In the stimulus-induced jerks the relative latencies of muscles innervated by rostral and caudal spinal segments suggested that the myoclonus originated between the upper cervical and midthoracic cord. In the final patient, EMG activity during spontaneous and stimulus-induced jerks commenced in the rectus abdominis, and was followed by later activity in muscles innervated by rostral spinal segments, suggesting that the myoclonus originated in the midthoracic cord. No structural lesion was identified in this patient. Electrophysiological evidence is used to argue a spinal origin for these axial jerks in all 3 cases. There are striking features common both to this form of human myoclonus and to long propriospinal pathways identified in animals. The new concept of propriospinal myoclonus is suggested. 
5	CO2-welded venous anastomosis: enhancement of weld strength with heterologous fibrin glue. The milliwatt CO2 laser was used to perform end-to-end anastomoses in canine jugular veins. There was a high disruption rate (50%) in laser-welded veins (n = 10). Fibrin glue (n = 17), formed from human fresh-frozen plasma, enhanced the weld strength decreasing the disruption rate (18%), resulting in an 82% patency which nearly equaled the contralateral sutured vein patency (93%). The bursting strength was improved with fibrin glue. Transmural necrosis was present initially in all groups but extended for a longer distance in the vessel wall in laser-welded anastomoses. Sutured anastomoses exhibited a greater inflammatory response. In laser-welded anastomoses endothelial cells were not as confluent as in sutured anastomoses by six weeks. Carbon dioxide laser-welded end-to-end vein anastomoses appear to be impractical because they disrupt too easily. However, the addition of heterologous fibrin glue to the weld results in a reasonably strong anastomosis with histologic properties that may be beneficial in vein bypass grafts. 
1	Expression of Ki-1 antigen (CD30) in mesenchymal tumors. Expression of CD30(Ki-1) antigen has long been considered to be restricted to activated lymphocytes and related tumors. However, expression of this antigen has also been detected in embryonal carcinomas, in nonembryonal carcinomas, in malignant melanomas, and even in some myeloid cell lines and macrophages at late stages of differentiation. In this study, using monoclonal antibody Ki-1, expression of CD30 antigen was immunohistochemically examined in frozen sections of 28 benign and 63 malignant mesenchymal tumors. The authors found CD30 expressed in two of four leiomyomas, seven of 11 leiomysarcomas, one of six rhabdomyosarcomas, two of two aggressive fibromatoses, one of three fibrosarcomas, two of four synovial sarcomas, one giant cell tumors of tendon sheaths, all five malignant fibrous histiocytomas, all three osteosarcomas, one of three Ewing's sarcomas, in a tumor cell subpopulation of two of ten malignant schwannomas, and in the Schwann cell compartment of one of two ganglioneuromas tested. Furthermore, CD30 was consistently expressed in the myoepithelial compartment of 13 fibroadenomas. However, all five lipomas, all seven liposarcomas, all three neuroblastomas, both ganglioneuroblastomas, both chondrosarcomas, and tumors of disputed origin tested were consistently CD30 negative. These findings indicate that, outside the lymphatic system, CD30 antigen is not restricted to epithelial neoplasms but may also be present in tumors of mesenchymal origin. The authors conclude that CD30 antigen, although having limited utility in the differential diagnosis of tumors of questionable histogenesis, may eventually define relevant subgroups within the main tumor categories. 
1	Why patients delay seeking care for cancer symptoms. What you can do about it. Patient delay in seeking care for cancer symptoms is common and well documented by research studies. Fear and denial, lack of information about cancer, and financial considerations all contribute to this delay. Patient education may be an important factor in decreasing the length of delay and thereby improving treatment outcome. By making good use of opportunities for patient education, primary care physicians may positively influence the prognosis of several types of cancer, particularly breast cancer and malignant melanoma of the skin. 
5	Membrane oxygenator prevents lung reperfusion injury in canine cardiopulmonary bypass The effect of blood activation on lung reperfusion injury during cardiopulmonary bypass was investigated in 20 dogs with the use of a bubble oxygenator (n = 10) or a membrane oxygenator (n = 10). In the bubble oxygenator group, significant leukocyte and platelet right to left atrium gradients were found 15 minutes after lung reperfusion (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01) accompanied by a sharp increase in plasma malondialdehyde concentration 5 minutes after lung reperfusion, whereas no significant right to left atrium gradient of leukocytes or platelets nor significant increase in plasma malondialdehyde concentration was observed in the membrane oxygenator group. In both the bubble oxygenator and membrane oxygenator group, similar mild to moderate lung histological changes were found before lung reperfusion. After lung reperfusion, however, more endothelial cell swelling (p less than 0.05), leukocyte (p less than 0.01) and platelet (p less than 0.01) accumulation in lung capillaries, leakage of erythrocytes into the alveolar space (p less than 0.05), and type I cell damage (p less than 0.05) were found only in the bubble oxygenator group. Eventually, a significantly higher lung water content was found in the bubble oxygenator group than in the membrane oxygenator group (p less than 0.01) after cardiopulmonary bypass. This study indicated that lung injury during cardiopulmonary bypass starts mainly after lung reperfusion, which was correlated with lung leukocyte and platelet sequestration associated with different types of oxygenators. 
1	Immunocytochemical profile of benign and carcinomatous effusions. A practical approach to difficult diagnosis. One of the great challenges in the cytodiagnosis of effusions is the distinction between reactive mesothelium/histiocytes and cancer cells. This is notably true in patients having undergone radiation and/or chemotherapy. To establish whether monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) could be used as reliable diagnostic adjuvants, the authors retrospectively and blindly studied 60 cases diagnosed by standard cytologic criteria (malignant, benign, and equivocal), with a panel of seven readily available MoAbs (cytokeratins, vimentin, EMA, B72.3, alpha-CEA, HMFG-2, and Leu-M1) and the lectin Ulex europaeus I. All 18 (100%) malignant cases showed reactivity with EMA and HMFG, whereas 17 (95%) and 11 (61%) reacted with B72.3 and alpha-CEA, respectively. Combinations of (1) EMA + B72.3, (2) EMA + alpha-CEA, and (3) EMA + alpha-CEA + B72.3 displayed positivity in 17 (95%), 11 (61%), and 10 (56%) malignant cases, respectively. Of the 18 benign cases, 7 reacted with HMFG and 2 each with EMA and B72.3. Only one case (5.5%) reacted with both EMA and B72.3. Based on these results, the 24 equivocal cases were regrouped into 14 malignant and 10 benign cases. Follow-up effusions obtained within the ensuing three months in all these patients allowed the authors to unequivocally confirm the diagnosis in all but five. The combination of EMA and B72.3 MoAbs detected malignant cells in 95% of the cases, with a 3.5% incidence of false positive cases in this study. A panel of EMA, B72.3, and alpha-CEA MoAbs should prove the most useful and simple approach to the correct diagnosis in most questionable effusions. Some of the potential pitfalls are discussed. 
4	Pheochromocytoma and acute myocardial infarction. When a pheochromocytoma is manifested as an acute myocardial illness, diagnosis may be difficult to make. If the tumor is suspected early enough, a workup can be done while the complications of the myocardial illness are being controlled (as in our case). The tumor can then be expeditiously removed before any further problems develop. The case presented here underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for a pheochromocytoma in any patient who has an unexpected myocardial event. 
4	Angiographic demonstration of acute phase of intracranial arterial spasm following aneurysm rupture. Case report. A case documenting the acute phase of intracranial arterial spasm following rupture of an aneurysm arising from the left internal carotid artery is reported. The patient deteriorated due to recurrent hemorrhage while undergoing angiography 12 hours after the initial aneurysm rupture. The acute deterioration was accompanied by dilatation of the ipsilateral pupil and occurred during injection of contrast material. There was delayed filling of the middle cerebral artery complex along with this narrowing. The arterial narrowing was confirmed to have completely disappeared on an angiographic series performed 14 minutes after the first series of films. The etiology of the acute vasospasm is discussed. 
4	Muscle fatigue in McArdle's disease. Muscle fibre conduction velocity and surface EMG frequency spectrum during ischaemic exercise. The origin of fatigue in McArdle's disease is still a matter of debate. Both a reduction of muscle membrane excitability and failure of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling have been suggested as causes. We performed intermittent isometric biceps brachii contractions (80% maximal voluntary contraction, rate 30/min) under local ischaemia in 5 McArdle's disease patients and 26 healthy controls. Our results show that in McArdle's disease the exerted force is less, the surface EMG (SEMG) amplitude steadily increases, and that the power density spectrum (PDS) shifts to lower frequencies, the latter without significant differences when compared with normals. The most important finding is that muscle membrane excitability remains unimpaired during ischaemic exercise, establishing a dominant role for intramuscular lactic acid formation in the reduction of muscle fibre conduction velocity seen in normal subjects. As is indicated by the shift of the PDS towards lower frequencies, as well as by the increase in SEMG amplitude, it can be concluded that during ischaemic exercise in patients with myophosphorylase deficiency, fatigue occurs without alterations in muscle membrane excitability and is due to a failure of E-C coupling. 
1	Spinal hemangioblastoma, syrinx, and hydrocephalus in a two-year-old child. A two-year-old child presented with an acute inability to bear weight. Radiological investigation revealed a large cervicothoracolumbar syrinx of no known cause. During investigation, acute communicating hydrocephalus developed, which required a shunt. At surgery, a small thoracic spinal cord hemangioblastoma was discovered and excised. Complete recovery with collapse of the syrinx followed. The clinical features of this rare childhood tumor and its associated effects are discussed. 
4	Outcome of CPR in a large metropolitan area--where are the survivors? STUDY OBJECTIVES: Survival from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in cities with populations of more than 1 million has not been studied adequately. This study was undertaken to determine the overall survival rate for Chicago and the effect of previously reported variables on survival, and to compare the observed survival rates with those previously reported. DESIGN: Consecutive prehospital arrest patients were studied prospectively during 1987. SETTING: The study area was the city of Chicago, which has more than 3 million inhabitants in 228 square miles. The emergency medical services system, with 55 around-the-clock ambulances and 550 paramedics, is single-tiered and responds to more than 200,000 emergencies per year. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: We studied 3,221 victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest on whom paramedics attempted resuscitation. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of patients were pronounced dead in emergency departments, 7% died in hospitals, and 2% survived to hospital discharge. Survival was significantly greater with bystander-witnessed arrest, bystander-initiated CPR, paramedic-witnessed arrest, initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, and shorter treatment intervals. CONCLUSIONS: The overall survival rates were significantly lower than those reported in most previous studies, all based on smaller communities; they were consistent with the rates reported in the one comparable study of a large city. The single factor that most likely contributed to the poor overall survival was the relatively long interval between collapse and defibrillation. Logistical, demographic, and other special characteristics of large cities may have affected the rates. To improve treatment of cardiac arrest in large cities and maximize the use of community resources, we recommend further study of comparable metropolitan areas using standardized terms and methodology. Detailed analysis of each component of the emergency medical services systems will aid in making improvements to maximize survival of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 
4	In-hospital and 1-year mortality in 1,524 women after myocardial infarction. Comparison with 4,315 men. We determined in-hospital and 1-year prognoses after acute myocardial infarction (MI) in 5,839 consecutive patients derived from 14 of 21 coronary care units in Israel during 1981-1983. Age-adjusted in-hospital mortality was 23.1% in 1,524 women and 15.7% in 4,315 men (p less than 0.0005). One-year age-adjusted mortality rates in patients surviving hospitalization were 11.8% in women and 9.3% in men (p = 0.03). Cumulative age-adjusted 1-year mortality rates were 31.8% in women and 23.1% in men (p less than 0.0005). Relative odds of mortality, covariate-adjusted for major prognostic factors that included age, prior MI, congestive heart failure, and infarct location by electrocardiogram, indicated that female gender was independently and significantly associated with increased mortality both during hospitalization (relative odds, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.45-2.04) and at 1 year after discharge (relative odds, 1.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-1.66). In separate multivariate analyses for each gender, a major factor that emerged as a predictor of outcome in women, but not in men, was a reported history of diabetes mellitus, both for in-hospital mortality and for 1-year mortality. However, even in the nondiabetics in this population, female gender was a significant, independent predictor of in-hospital mortality. The findings of the present study substantiate that women fare worse than men after suffering an acute MI, that increased age does not fully account for the increased mortality in women, and that diabetic women are at particularly high risk once MI has occurred. 
5	Fetomaternal bleeding as a cause of recurrent fetal morbidity and mortality. A woman had fetomaternal bleeding of unknown cause during at least three of five pregnancies. Each event was associated with significant fetal morbidity or mortality. Although fetomaternal bleeding has been reported as a cause of unexplained fetal death, its occurrence in subsequent pregnancies has not been described previously. 
5	Spontaneous pneumothorax: marker gas technique for predicting outcome of manual aspiration [published erratum appears in BMJ 1991 Mar 23;302(6778):697] OBJECTIVE--To determine whether in a patient with spontaneous pneumothorax the presence or absence of a pleural leak can be shown at the time of manual aspiration by use of a marker gas. Also, to find out if the technique can predict whether manual aspiration will be successful, hence avoiding the need for intercostal tube drainage. DESIGN--Prospective study of 25 episodes of pneumothorax during which patients breathed air from a Douglas bag that contained chlorofluorocarbon gases from a metered dose inhaler while the pneumothorax was aspirated. SETTING--Medical unit of a district general hospital. PATIENTS--22 patients who presented over nine months with acute pneumothorax. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Presence or absence of chlorofluorocarbon marker gases in the aspirate. Presence or absence of sustained re-expansion of the affected lung in the chest radiograph. RESULTS--Marker gas was detected in the aspirate from 16 out of 25 pneumothoraces. Of these, 13 required intercostal tube drainage because of failure of the lung to re-expand. Marker gas was not detected in nine cases, and in all of these cases manual aspiration resulted in sustained re-expansion of the lung. CONCLUSIONS--The presence or absence of a pleural leak during manual aspiration of spontaneous pneumothorax can be shown by using this technique. The absence of marker gas in the aspirate implies that manual aspiration will be successful, whereas its presence predicts, in most cases, either failure of manual aspiration to expand the lung or early re-collapse of the lung. 
5	Emergent aneurysm surgery without cerebral angiography for the comatose patient Neurologically based clinical grading scales offer excellent prognostic information for the patient suffering diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). These grading scales are less applicable to patients with life-threatening intraparenchymal hematomas after aneurysmal rupture. During the last 3 years, four patients in a comatose state with brain stem compression syndromes documented by computed tomographic scans have undergone emergent operation in our neurosurgical service. Each patient was so critically ill that we believed it unwise to delay craniotomy for diagnostic angiography. The average delay from the onset of coma to skin incision was 3.02 hours (range, 1.67-6.5 hours), and the average delay from arrival in our unit until skin incision was 1.8 hours (range, 0.75-2.5 hours). The condition of two arousable patients deteriorated while they were in the emergency room, presumably from new bleeding. Each patient underwent craniotomy for hematoma evacuation, definitive aneurysm clipping, and lobectomy for decompression. Temporary clipping was employed in one patient, and intraoperative rupture occurred in two others. Three patients survived but retain significant disability. Emergent craniotomy with empiric exploration of appropriate subarachnoid cisterns after hematoma decompression may be life-saving in some cases. The delay imposed for diagnostic angiography may be avoided in attempts to save vital minutes of severe brain stem compression. 
4	Comparison of cardiac catheterization and Doppler echocardiography in the decision to operate in aortic and mitral valve disease Clinical decisions utilizing either Doppler echocardiographic or cardiac catheterization data were compared in adult patients with isolated or combined aortic and mitral valve disease. A clinical decision to operate, not operate or remain uncertain was made by experienced cardiologists given either Doppler echocardiographic or cardiac catheterization data. A prospective evaluation was performed on 189 consecutive patients (mean age 67 years) with valvular heart disease who were being considered for surgical treatment on the basis of clinical information. All patients underwent cardiac catheterization and detailed Doppler echocardiographic examination. Three sets of two cardiologist decision makers who did not know patient identity were given clinical information in combination with either Doppler echocardiographic or cardiac catheterization data. The combination of Doppler echocardiographic and clinical data was considered inadequate for clinical decision making in 21% of patients with aortic and 5% of patients with mitral valve disease. The combination of cardiac catheterization and clinical data was considered inadequate in 2% of patients with aortic and 2% of patients with mitral valve disease. Among the remaining patients, the cardiologists using echocardiographic or angiographic data were in agreement on the decision to operate or not operate in 113 (76% overall). When the data were analyzed by specific valve lesion, decisions based on Doppler echocardiography or catheterization were in agreement in 92%, 90%, 83% and 69%, respectively, of patients with aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Differences in cardiac output determination, estimation of valvular regurgitation and information concerning coronary anatomy were the main reasons for different clinical management decisions. These results suggest that for most adult patients with aortic or mitral valve disease, alone or in combination, Doppler echocardiographic data enable the clinician to make the same decision reached with catheterization data. 
5	Interferon antibodies may negate the antiviral effects of recombinant alpha-interferon treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. In a randomized controlled trial of recombinant alpha-2a interferon for chronic hepatitis B, interferon antibodies developed in 21 (39%) of 54 Chinese adults who received IFN. No correlation was observed between sex, age, pretreatment serum ALT level or liver histological findings and the development of interferon antibodies. Antibodies were significantly more likely to develop in patients who received lower doses (2.5 or 5 MU/m2) of alpha-2a interferon than in those who received a higher dose (10 MU/m2): 53% vs. 11% (p = 0.006). The development of interferon antibodies appeared to reverse the initial antiviral response to treatment, with reappearance of hepatitis B virus DNA in serum in 12 patients and HBeAg in three patients. Sustained clearance of HBeAg was achieved in only one (5%) patient but was achieved in seven (21%) patients without interferon antibodies. The mere presence of interferon antibodies did not preclude an antiviral response to interferon therapy, but patients with high titer neutralizing antibodies were less likely to respond. These findings suggest that interferon antibodies may negate the antiviral effects of alpha-2a interferon. A higher incidence of interferon antibodies in Chinese vs. white patients with chronic hepatitis B may contribute to the poorer antiviral response in Chinese patients. 
1	Polycystic ovary syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome is a disorder of unknown cause characterized by anovulation, hyperandrogenism, and gonadotropin secretory abnormalities producing oligo-ovulation or anovulation. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are important features of this syndrome. Because other causes of androgen excess may produce similar clinical and biochemical findings, PCO remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms of hyperandrogenemia in order to stimulate ovulation, correcting obesity, and inducing regular menses to reduce the risk of endometrial cancer. 
1	Adjuvant therapy for node-negative breast cancer. The use of prognostic factors in selecting patients. Patients with invasive breast cancer and pathologically negative lymph nodes (NO) have a favorable 10-year survival rate, particularly with small (less than 1 cm) primary tumors. Overall, however, 20% to 35% will experience recurrence with local therapy only. Adjuvant chemotherapy or tamoxifen have prolonged disease-free survival (DFS), but not overall survival (OS). Unanswered questions of optimal end point (DFS or OS) and the risk of treating many to benefit few have prompted clinicians to use prognostic indicators to facilitate treatment recommendations. Currently, the most readily available and accurate information comes from TNM staging, pathologic features, and hormone receptors. Ploidy, S-phase fraction, HER-2-neu amplification or over-expression, and cathepsin-D may be useful prognostic indices. Until a more precise system of weighing several prognostic variables is developed, the decision to recommend adjuvant systemic therapy in this generally good prognosis group will have to be thoughtfully considered by patient and physician. Whenever possible, patients should be encouraged to enter clinical trials. 
1	The significance of Leu 8 negative T cells in lymphoid skin infiltrates: malignant transformation, selective homing or T-cell activation? The expression of Leu 8 was studied on skin biopsies from a large group of patients with benign and malignant skin disorders and correlated with the expression of T-cell differentiation antigens and activation markers. The effect of in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood T cells and T-cell subsets on the expression of Leu 8 antigen was also determined. In all the skin diseases studied an inverse relationship was found between the proportions of cells expressing Leu 8 and HLA-DR. A deficiency of Leu 8 positive cells was not specific for mycosis fungoides, but was also found in several reactive dermatoses. Stimulation of peripheral blood cells with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and anti-CD3-PMA resulted in a considerable decrease of Leu 8 antigen expression on day 3 in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These data suggest that the low proportion of Leu 8+ T cells in mycosis fungoides and several reactive skin disorders is not related to malignant transformation or selective homing of Leu 8- T cells, but probably results from local T-cell activation. 
5	The role of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy in the management of bleeding peristomal varices. Peristomal varices usually occur in patients with enterostomies who develop portal hypertension, and represent a cause of recurrent or intractable gastrointestinal bleeding. Treatment options for such bleeding include surgical ligation of varices, stoma revision with devascularization, injection sclerotherapy, portacaval shunt, or liver transplantation. We reviewed the records of seven patients with peristomal varices, who were followed for a mean of 17 months after diagnosis. Fourteen episodes of clinically significant peristomal bleeding occurred in six patients. Surgical ligation of varices was ineffective in controlling bleeding in two of three patients, although stoma revision with devascularization was temporarily effective in two other patients. Injection sclerotherapy, used in three patients, effectively controlled acute bleeding without serious complications or need for surgery. Definitive treatment for peristomal bleeding (portacaval shunt or liver transplantation) has prevented any further bleeding in three patients for a mean of 8 months after surgery. 
4	Sinus nodal dysfunction in young patients with long QT syndrome. Although sinus bradycardia and low heart rate with exercise have been found in some patients with long QT syndrome, systematic evaluation, including intracardiac electrophysiologic (EPS) tests of sinus node function, has not been reported. Records were reviewed of 14 children and adolescents (age 3 to 16 years) with long QT syndrome (mean QTc 0.51 second) who underwent noninvasive testing and intracardiac EPS because of syncope or cardiac arrest. The resting electrocardiographic (ECG) sinus heart rate was low for age in only 1 of 13 patients, while the lowest Holter-monitored sinus heart rate was abnormal in 4 of 12. The maximum exercise heart rate was abnormally low in 6 of the 12 who underwent exercise testing. For the EPS tests, the corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) was long in 8 of 14 and the sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) was long in six of the nine in whom it was calculable. When both noninvasive and EPS indices are considered, 13 of the 14 patients had some type of sinus node dysfunction. 
1	Oral magnetic particles in MR imaging of the abdomen and pelvis. Two phase 2 clinical trials of an oral superparamagnetic contrast agent for enhancement on magnetic resonance images of the intestine were performed. In trial 1, 31 male patients with cancer of the testis underwent follow-up examinations of the abdomen at 0.5 and 1.5 T after oral administration of magnetic particles. In trial 2, 31 female patients with pelvic and lower abdominal disease were examined at 1.5 T after administration of the contrast material. The patients each ingested 800 mL of contrast material over approximately 2 hours. Concentrations of 0.25 and 0.5 g/L did not induce blurring or metallic artifacts. Distribution was homogeneous through the gastrointestinal tract. In all patients, a loss of signal intensity was observed on proton density-, T1-, and T2-weighted images. The diagnostic information from postcontrast images in trial 2 was greater in 16 patients (52%). Contrast enhancement was independent of field strength; no major side effects were observed. Artifacts from moving bowels were less troublesome, and delineation of intraabdominal and pelvic organs was better with the use of oral magnetic particles. 
3	A unique indexing splint for use in combined Le Fort and nasal injuries to avoid tracheostomy. Midface fractures with associated displaced and/or comminuted nasal fractures can require tracheostomy for a general anesthetic airway if these fractures are to be reduced simultaneously. We describe a unique indexing splint that allows oral intubation yet also allows simultaneous reduction of midface and nasal fractures under one anesthetic. Furthermore, tracheostomy with its potential complications is avoided. The case report illustrates the technique, and alternative treatments for these injuries are discussed. 
5	Two distinct loci on the short arm of chromosome 16 are involved in myeloid leukemia. We report a case of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) M5 with the characteristic t(8;16)(p11;p13). The breakpoint in the short arm was regionally localized using nonradioactive in situ hybridization with a series of cosmids of chromosome 16. The results show that a difference exists between the breakpoint in chromosome 16(p13) in this t(8;16) and the breakpoint involved in the short arm in the characteristic inversion 16 (p13;q22)) that occurs in ANLL M4eo. Two different loci appear to be involved in these chromosomal rearrangements. 
5	Molecular basis of the activation of the tumorigenic potential of Gag-insulin receptor chimeras. A previous study showed that the human insulin receptor (IR) could be activated by insertion of a 3' portion of the cDNA encoding the beta subunit into a retrovirus genome to form a Gag-IR fusion protein. While capable of transforming cells in culture, this IR cDNA-containing virus, called UIR, was not able to induce tumors in animals. Subsequently, we isolated a spontaneous sarcomagenic variant called UIR19t from the parental UIR. UIR19t was molecularly cloned, sequenced, and found to harbor two mutations. A 44-amino acid deletion immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain of the Gag-IR fusion protein removes all the extracellular sequence of the IR remaining in the original UIR construct. In addition, a single nucleotide deletion at the 3' end results in truncation and replacement of the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids by 4 new amino acids. The specific kinase activity of UIR19t is 4- to 5-fold higher than that of the parental UIR. However, no new cellular substrates were detected in UIR19t-transformed cells as compared to UIR cells. Viruses containing either the 5' or the 3' deletion mutation were constructed and assessed for their biological function. Our data indicate that the 5' deletion alone is sufficient to confer tumorigenic ability. We conclude that sequence immediately upstream from the transmembrane domain imposes a negative effect on the transforming and tumorigenic potential of the Gag-IR fusion protein. 
5	Interleukin-6 and its receptor are expressed by human megakaryocytes: in vitro effects on proliferation and endoreplication. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays an important role in the megakaryocytic differentiation. Recently, we have observed that IL-6 is synthesized by several human cell lines with megakaryocytic features. In this study, we have investigated whether a similar phenomenon occurs during normal megakaryocytic differentiation. Human megakaryocytes (MK) were obtained by culturing normal marrow in liquid culture with aplastic plasma (AP). First, an IL-6 secretion in bone marrow culture enriched in MK as well as in purified MK populations was demonstrated by a biologic assay. Second, IL-6 mRNA was detected in a purified population of MK by the polymerase chain reaction and dot blot analysis. IL-6 mRNA and protein were undetectable in platelets. Third, in situ hybridization procedure demonstrated the presence of IL-6 mRNA in individual immature MK. Fourth, IL-6 protein was detected in MK at the unicellular level by an immunoalkaline phosphatase technique using a monoclonal antibody against IL-6. Furthermore, the presence of IL-6 receptor (IL-6-R) on MK was demonstrated by in situ hybridization using an IL-6-R probe and in situ autoradiography after binding with [125I]-labeled recombinant IL-6. The IL-6 endogenously produced in liquid cultures containing normal human plasma or AP was subsequently neutralized. This resulted in a 50% decrease of the MK growth with a minor shift in the ploidy distribution toward lower values. In semisolid cultures the addition of anti-IL-6 antibodies led to a 42% decrease in colony number in cultures stimulated by IL-3 but not in other conditions of culture. These results suggest that normal human megakaryocytopoiesis might be regulated in part by an IL-6 autocrine loop. 
5	Evaluating tooth eruption on sealant efficacy. For patients aged 5 to 9 and 11 to 14, 100 occlusal surfaces on newly erupting permanent molars were treated with a self-curing pit and fissure sealant. All teeth were categorized according to stage of eruption and sealant thickness of the coating applied. After 36 months, 75 surfaces were examined for a final evaluation; 52 surfaces (70%) did not need retreatment. Of the 23 surfaces retreated as a result of sealant loss or marginal deterioration, 18 were retreated only once in the six recall evaluations. Those molars treated originally with the operculum covering the distal marginal ridge of the occlusal surface had twice the probability for retreatment as teeth not treated until the entire marginal ridge was exposed. The thickness of the sealant coating did not affect the early signs of sealant failure. 
1	A vascular malformation mimicking an intracanalicular acoustic neurilemoma. Case report. A patient with an enhancing, completely intracanalicular mass on magnetic resonance imaging was operated on for a presumed acoustic neurilemoma, but was found at surgery to have an intracanalicular vascular malformation. This rare lesion should be distinguished from angiomatous change within an acoustic neurilemoma and in the past has been termed "vascular tumor," "hemangioma," or "fibro-angioma." The clinical distinctions between intracanalicular acoustic neurilemomas and intracanalicular vascular malformations and the ability of magnetic resonance imaging to distinguish between the two are discussed. 
1	Systemic mast cell disease associated with primary mediastinal germ cell tumor. The first known case of systemic mast cell disease associated with a germ cell tumor is reported. Six months after the complete remission of a primary mediastinal germ cell tumor treated by chemotherapy and resection, a young man had a series of episodes of hypotension and syncope and, a few months later, a gastric hemorrhage and coagulation disorder. The diagnosis of systemic mast cell disease was made in view of bone marrow and liver biopsies. A transient circulating heparin-like anticoagulant was noted. The occurrence in a short period of these two unusual conditions, given previous knowledge of hematologic disorders associated with germ cell tumors, suggests that the present association is not a coincidence. Systemic mast cell disease should be considered among the hematologic disorders associated with a germ cell tumor. 
2	Pathogenetic role of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer disease. Multivariate analysis of factors affecting relapse. The pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer disease is multifactorial and the contribution of Helicobacter pylori in relation to the other factors to the release of duodenal ulcer is unknown. To investigate this, we studied 147 patients with endoscopically proven healed ulcers. These patients were randomized to receive either placebo, misoprostol 200 micrograms or misoprostol 300 micrograms four times daily, and clinical, personal, physiological and endoscopic characteristics were obtained prospectively. Endoscopy was performed at the active phase of the ulcer and when the ulcer healed. Biopsies were taken from the antrum to assess histologically for: (1) the activity of gastritis as assessed by the degree of polymorph infiltration, (2) the degree of chronic inflammation by the degree of chronic inflammatory cells infiltration and degree of mucosal degeneration, and (3) bacteriologically for the presence of H. pylori. The severity of the gastritis and the bacterial density were graded independently by two pathologists. The patients were assessed at two-month intervals for 12 months or until the ulcer relapsed. The results demonstrated that the relapse rates of duodenal ulcer were similar in the three treatment groups. The relapse rate was higher in the group with higher density of the bacteria (P less than 0.05). The degree of gastritis did not affect the relapse rate of duodenal ulcer in either the placebo or misoprostol group or in all patients combined. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified that increased duodenal inflammation, male sex, early-onset disease, and H. pylori adversely affected relapse of the ulcer. We conclude that multiple factors affect the relapse of duodenal ulcer and H. pylori is one of them. 
2	Endometrioma of the liver. Hepatic endometriosis is extremely rare. We describe a patient sent to us with epigastric pain as the only symptom and who was found to have associated endometrioma of the liver and left ovary. We suggest a gynecologic evaluation before surgery for hepatic cyst of unknown cause. 
4	Silent myocardial ischemia and infarction in diabetics with peripheral vascular disease: assessment by dipyridamole thallium-201 scintigraphy. We investigated the incidence of silent myocardial ischemia and infarction as assessed by dipyridamole thallium scintigraphy in 30 diabetic patients with peripheral vascular disease and without clinical suspicion of coronary artery disease. Seventeen patients (57%) had thallium abnormalities, with reversible thallium defects compatible with ischemia in 14 patients (47%) and evidence of prior, clinically silent myocardial infarction in 11 patients (37%). Thallium abnormalities were most frequent in patients with concomitant hypertension and cigarette smoking (p = 0.001). These results suggest that unsuspected coronary artery disease is common in this particular group of patients with diabetes mellitus. 
1	The fetus as a patient. Surgical considerations. The diagnosis and treatment of human fetal defects has evolved rapidly over the past decade due to improved fetal imaging techniques and better understanding of fetal pathophysiology derived from animal models. The detection of a fetal anomaly may now lead to a change in the timing of delivery, a change in the mode of delivery, or prenatal treatment. Because most therapeutic maneuvers involve some risk to the fetus and mother, there must be a reasonable expectation that the procedure is feasible, safe, and effective before it can be attempted in humans. This requires reliable information about the pathophysiology and natural history of the disease process, the efficacy of fetal surgical intervention in ameliorating the disease, and the feasibility and safety of the proposed intervention. This paper focuses on the rationale and initial clinical experience with fetal surgery for a variety of life-threatening fetal anatomic defects. 
5	Splenic artery aneurysm rupture [published erratum appears in Am J Emerg Med 1991 Mar;9(2):205] Splenic artery aneurysms are rare and usually asymptomatic. However, rupture can produce severe abdominal pain and prove lethal. Two cases of ruptured splenic artery aneurysm are presented. In one, cocaine injection occurred immediately prior to the onset of symptoms and may have precipitated the event. 
1	Ruptured mature cystic teratoma of the ovary with recurrence in the liver and colon 17 years later. A case report. A mature cystic teratoma of the ovary occurred in a 51-year-old woman and recurred as a large intrahepatic tumor mass as well as a small mass in the transverse colon 17 years after rupture, intraperitoneal spillage of tumor contents and subtotal surgical removal of the ovarian lesion and peritoneal implants. The patient was treated with a partial hepatectomy and a segmental transverse colectomy. The recurrent lesions, which contained histologically fully mature teratomatous elements only, were excised; the result was a complete cure. To our knowledge this is the first documented report on such a complication of mature cystic teratoma of the ovary. 
5	Intravenous fluid load and recovery. A double-blind comparison in gynaecological patients who had day-case laparoscopy. The effect of intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration upon recovery was tested in a randomised, double-blind trial. Three groups of 25 patients, each undergoing laparoscopic examination as day cases, were studied. The two groups who received fluid (20 ml/kg compound sodium lactate solution) showed significant improvement (p less than 0.05) in the variables that reflected hydration. The fluid group who also received dextrose (1 g/kg) exhibited further significant improvement. Intra-operative fluid and dextrose administration appears to confer some benefit upon recovery in patients who have minor surgery. 
2	Unconjugated bilirubin and cholesterol gallstone formation. Cholesterol gallstones usually have small amounts of pigment at their centers and often have diffuse pigmentation or pigmented layers alternating with cholesterol layers and/or pigmented rims associated with calcium carbonate (eggshell calcification). The pigments are primarily monomeric calcium salts of unconjugated bilirubin anions and/or an insoluble, black, network polymer of tetrapyrroles. Bilirubin presumably can precipitate only if bile is supersaturated with calcium bilirubinates. Among various in vitro model systems, the aqueous solubilities and pK'a values for unconjugated bilirubin differ greatly. It is therefore not known whether normal bile is saturated with unconjugated bilirubin. However, all systems indicate that unconjugated bilirubin is solubilized by binding to bile salt monomers and oligomers, as well as micelles; marked metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin can occur in the presence of bile salt micelles, and both pK'a values of unconjugated bilirubin are greater than 6.0, probably because of internal hydrogen-bonding of the--COOH groups. Lecithin decreases equilibrium solubilization of unconjugated bilirubin crystals but enhances metastable supersaturation of unconjugated bilirubin. Calcium ions form insoluble salts with unconjugated bilirubin monoanions and dianions but soluble complexes with bilirubin conjugates. The solubility products of the calcium bilirubinate salts suggest that normal hepatic bile is not saturated with CaB or Ca(HB)2 but that gallbladder bile may be supersaturated with Ca(HB)2. 
4	Effects of hypertension on pregnancy monitoring and results. The effect of severity of hypertension on fetal heart rate tracing changes and neonatal outcomes was evaluated on all patients with hypertension seen in 1980 and 1981 (666 cases, 10% of the pregnant population) in the Chicago-Lying In Hospital. The patients were grouped according to severity of hypertension, and the fetal heart rate monitoring, drugs administered, mode of delivery, and neonatal outcome were analyzed. Half of the patients (326) had mild hypertension and 13% (87) had severe hypertension; the remainder (253) had moderate hypertension. There were 49% primiparous and 51% multiparous women. The diagnosis of preeclampsia was made in 76% of cases, and chronic hypertension in 19%. Only 12% of the total were premature by dates, but 47% of this group were among the severe group. Oxytocin was given to 50%, whereas delivery was spontaneous in 56% of cases, and by cesarean section in 22%. This was higher among the severe hypertension group (37%), and the prematurity rate was 47%. Nonstress testing was done in one third of cases and only nonreactivity was associated with neonatal death. Neonatal depression (Apgar score less than 6 at 5 minutes) was significantly associated with intrapartum fixed baseline and late decelerations; these were the best predictors of fetal outcome. The administration of magnesium sulfate, hydralazine, meperidine, or morphine did not predictably affect the fetal heart rate pattern. The perinatal mortality was 21% in the mild group and 36% and 138%, respectively, among moderate and severe cases of hypertension. Close antepartum and intrapartum surveillance, including proper fetal monitoring, should help to reduce risks for mother and fetus through timely intervention. 
5	Visual recovery in patients with optic neuritis and visual loss to no light perception. We reviewed the records of 151 patients with optic neuritis examined over an eight-year period. Of these patients, 12 developed visual acuity of no light perception during the first episode of optic neuritis in the affected eye. Eight of the 12 patients recovered visual acuity of 20/40 or better. Of these, five patients had visual acuity of 20/20 or better, one had visual acuity of 20/25, one had visual acuity of 20/30, and one had visual acuity of 20/40. Four of the 12 patients recovered peripheral visual fields but had dense central scotomas and visual acuity of less than 20/400. Dyschromatopsia persisted after visual recovery in 11 of 12 patients. 
1	Surgical management of pheochromocytoma with the use of metyrosine. Despite recommended preoperative preparation with alpha-adrenergic blockers, severe hemodynamic instability may occur during operations to resect pheochromocytoma. We combined the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor metyrosine in an attempt to better manage the hypertension of patients with pheochromocytoma undergoing surgical resection. This report reviews the cases of 25 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for known intra-abdominal pheochromocytoma. Each patient had elevated serum or urine levels of catecholamines or their metabolites. Nineteen patients were prepared before operation with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine and six patients were given phenoxybenzamine alone. There were no significant differences in maximum, minimum, or mean blood pressure before or after tumor resection between patients who received metyrosine and those who did not. However careful review suggested that those who received metyrosine had more severe disease as judged by biochemical criteria. Study of selected patients matched for age and severity of disease suggested that the intraoperative blood pressure management of patients prepared with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine was facilitated. In addition metyrosine-prepared patients lost less blood and required less volume replacement during surgery than did non-metyrosine-prepared patients. There were no apparent differences in postoperative fluid requirements. Although the study is not a prospective randomized trial, a retrospective review of patients managed with the combination of phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine suggests that surgery to resect pheochromocytoma can be better performed with both drugs than with phenoxybenzamine alone. The combination regimen appears to result in better blood pressure control, less blood loss, and the need for less intraoperative fluid replacement than does the traditional method of single-agent alpha-adrenergic blockade. 
3	Cranial nerve palsy in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Forty-five children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had cranial nerve palsy (CNP) as a complication of their disease. Twenty-two of these children had CNP initially and 23, at relapse, with or without previous hematologic relapse. Only one of the 23 patients with CNP at relapse was a long-term survivor. In contrast, 11 of the 22 children who had CNP initially survived in remission for 3+ months to 13+ years. Two factors are associated with an improved outcome for patients with CNP at diagnosis: treatment after 1979 (P less than 0.004) and male gender (P less than 0.01). Patients who received radiation therapy fared better than those for whom radiation was not given (disease-free survival at 2 years 53% versus 29%). The authors conclude that CNP signifies an aggressive or advanced disease requiring intensive systemic chemotherapy and that the role of irradiation should be examined for this group of patients. 
5	Conservation surgery for glomus jugulare tumors: the value of early diagnosis. The results of lateral cranial base surgery for glomus jugulare tumors are gratifying when normal anatomy and function can be preserved. The goal of conservation surgery is to preserve normal ear anatomy and cranial nerve function. In general, conservation surgery is tumor-size dependent. Thus, excellent states of functional recovery depend upon accurate early diagnosis. This paper reviews the technical aspects of transtemporal conservation skull base tumor surgery while also reviewing our experience with nearly 100 glomus jugulare patients. Adjuvants to early diagnosis will be highlighted from a review of presenting symptoms, clinical signs, and related diagnosis. Our objective is to provoke a high index of suspicion in physicians charged with the responsibility of diagnosing these tumors. Diagnostic guidelines are proposed. 
2	Esophageal obstruction after ingestion of a fiber-containing diet pill. Foreign bodies of the esophagus in adults may be the result of a food bolus that becomes lodged proximal to a structural abnormality of the distal esophagus. A case of peptic stricture of the esophagus in a patient who presented with acute dysphagia after ingesting an over-the-counter diet pill composed of guar gum is discussed. It is recommended that anorectics composed of dietary fiber should not be used in patients with a history of esophageal stricture. 
5	Diagnostic evaluation of syncope Syncope is a common medical problem and is caused by a wide variety of diseases ranging from physiologic derangements with few consequences to conditions that may be immediately life-threatening. Because of the large differential diagnosis, many diagnostic tests are available for its evaluation. However, a cause of syncope is not established in 38% to 47% of patients despite these tests. In those patients in whom a diagnosis can be assigned, the history and physical examination identify a potential cause in 49% to 85%. Furthermore, in 8% of additional patients, history and physical examination are suggestive of causes that need confirmation by specific tests. Routine blood tests rarely yield diagnostically helpful information. In those patients in whom a potential cause for syncope is identified, arrhythmias are diagnosed by electrocardiogram in 2% to 11% of patients, cardiac monitoring in 3% to 27% (telemetry or Holter), stress test in less than 1%, carotid massage in less than 1%, and electrophysiologic studies in less than 3%. Diagnosis of arrhythmias as a cause of syncope is problematic because symptomatic correlation during electrocardiographic monitoring is rarely found (approximately 4%), and as a result, there is no uniform agreement on diagnostic criteria for abnormalities. Similar problems exist in the use of electrophysiologic studies. Upright tilt testing and psychiatric examination may be useful in evaluation of recurrent syncope of unknown cause in patients without organic heart disease. Based on the results of recent studies, strategies for evaluation of patients with syncope are possible that utilize selective and goal-directed diagnostic testing. 
5	Quantification of magnetic resonance scans for hippocampal and parahippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease The brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) invariably exhibit neuropathology in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex when examined postmortem. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers a noninvasive, high-resolution method for quantifying volumetric changes in the AD brain antemortem. Eight patients diagnosed with probable AD and 7 age-matched controls had MRI scans and were tested on a battery of cognitive and olfactory tests. The hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (parahippocampal gyrus) showed significant atrophy, with over 40% reduction in size. Areas of the brain that are not highly involved in the degenerative state of AD, such as the striatum, did not show significant volumetric changes. Hippocampal and parahippocampal gyrus volumes had the highest correlation with scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (r = 0.89), with lower correlations for a smell identification test (r = 0.65), odor match-to-sample test (r = 0.72), and a visual match-to-sample test (r = 0.26). 
5	The human antibody response to streptococcal C5a peptidase. An ELISA was developed to measure antibody, both IgG and IgA, against the streptococcal C5a peptidase (SCP), in human sera and saliva. Generally, sera and saliva from young, uninfected children lacked antibody to SCP. In contrast, most sera and saliva specimens from healthy adults had measurable levels of anti-SCP IgG and SCP-specific secretory IgA (anti-SCP sIgA). Paired acute and convalescent sera from patients with streptococcal pharyngitis possessed significantly higher levels of anti-SCP IgG than did sera from healthy individuals. Sera containing high concentrations of anti-SCP immunoglobulin were capable of neutralizing SCP activity. A survey of healthy adults and children also showed that the latter were significantly less likely to have anti-SCP sIgA in their saliva. Detection of this antibody in greater than 90% of the saliva specimens obtained from children who had recently experienced streptococcal pharyngitis demonstrated that children can produce a secretory response. This is thought to be the first report of a secretory IgA response in humans to a somatic antigen of Streptococcus pyogenes. 
3	Assessment and treatment of children's headaches from a developmental perspective. Childhood headache is a common pediatric problem. Clinical researchers have evaluated several behavioral treatment, such as biofeedback and relaxation training, that may be viable interventions. Adding a developmental perspective to the evaluation and treatment of childhood headache is a likely way to increase the effectiveness of these strategies. This paper presents developmental issues related to the assessment and treatment of childhood headache. Three major areas of development are examined and the impact of these areas on the treatment and assessment of headache are discussed. The three major areas are cognitive development, self-regulation and psychosocial development. Provided are practical suggestions for the application of child development principles to assessment and intervention practices that may be more developmentally appropriate. 
2	Controlled trial of antimycobacterial therapy in Crohn's disease. Clofazimine versus placebo. In order to study the effect of clofazimine, a powerful antimycobacterial and antiinflammatory agent, 49 patients with active Crohn's disease were randomized to either corticosteroids plus clofazimine 100 mg daily (N = 25) or to steroids and matching placebo (N = 24). A total of 28 patients (58%) went into disease remission (clofazimine 16, placebo 12; P = NS) with a fall in disease activity score from 10.5 +/- 4.4 to 3.3 +/- 3.5. Patients were treated for a further eight months with clofazimine or placebo and 18 of 28 maintained their remission and completed the study (clofazimine 12, placebo 6; P = NS). Side effects were minor and consisted of skin rash and increased pigmentation. Clofazimine as a solitary antimycobacterial agent appears ineffective in inducing remission in Crohn's disease but may have a role in either disease maintenance or combination chemotherapy. 
5	Aortic regurgitation after left ventricular myotomy and myectomy. Five hundred twenty-five patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy underwent left ventricular myotomy and myectomy (LVMM) from 1960 to 1990. Four hundred ninety-six had nonregurgitant trileaflet aortic valves before LVMM. In 19 (4%) of these patients, aortic regurgitation developed after LVMM. Age of the 19 patients ranged from 10 to 58 years (mean age, 35 +/- 3 [+/- standard error of the mean]]. Seven were male and 12, female. Five patients underwent LVMM followed immediately by aortic valve replacement or valvuloplasty. Aortic regurgitation developed in 14 patients at a later date. The average New York Heart Association functional class improved from 3.2 +/- 0.1 to 1.3 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.05, Student's t test) after operation. The average peak systolic left ventricular outflow tract gradient at rest and with provocation decreased from 65 +/- 8 to 14 +/- 5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and 108 +/- 9 to 45 +/- 7 mm Hg (p less than 0.05), respectively, 6 to 8 months after operation. Aortic regurgitation occurred in 7 of the 14 patients at 6 months or less after operation, and 3 required operative repair. In the other 7 patients, aortic regurgitation developed 3 years or more after LVMM, and 3 of them also required operative repair. All 12 patients in whom aortic regurgitation developed at operation or within 6 months postoperatively had either a very small aortic annulus (less than or equal to 21 mm, 5 patients), a low mitral-septal contact lesion (greater than or equal to 35 mm below the aortic annulus, 3 patients), or both (4 patients). 
5	Liver transplantation: the shadow side. For a relatively large number of patients with liver disease, a liver transplant does not always provide a successful solution. What does confrontation with this modern technology mean for those involved? We interviewed 30 relatives of patients who had died after they had been turned down for a transplant, or during or shortly after a liver transplant operation performed in the Groningen Liver Transplant Programme. Quantitative data were obtained by means of a questionnaire. One-third of the respondents were of the opinion that the patient would have been better off if he/she had not entered the programme. Over half found the loss more difficult to accept because the patient had been involved in the programme. Nevertheless, many had the feeling of satisfaction that everything possible had been done. However fruitful transplantation technology may be for a specific group of patients, it also involves undesirable side-effects which should be included in the careful judgement of this technology. 
3	The appearance of the piriformis muscle syndrome in computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. A case report and review of the literature. The piriformis syndrome (PS) is a controversial cause of hip pain because of the lack of objective findings to support the diagnosis. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed PS in a 27-year-old woman. This case may be one of the first reports in the literature on a piriformis muscle enlargement documented by CT and MR imaging. 
4	Regression of coronary atherosclerosis during treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia with combined drug regimens. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial in 72 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia to test whether reducing plasma low-density lipoprotein levels by diet and combined drug regimens can induce regression of coronary lesions. Four hundred fifty-seven lesions were measured before and after a 26-month interval by computer-based quantitative angiography. The primary outcome variable was within-patient mean change in percent area stenosis. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased from 7.32 +/- 1.5 to 4.45 +/- 1.6 mmol/L. The mean change in percent area stenosis among controls was +0.80, indicating progression, while the mean change for the treatment group was -1.53, indicating regression (P = .039 by two-tailed t test for the difference between groups). Regression among women, analyzed separately, was also significant. The change in percent area stenosis was correlated with low-density lipoprotein levels on trial. We conclude that reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels can induce regression of atherosclerotic lesions of the coronary arteries in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The anticipation of benefit from treatment applies to women and men alike. 
1	Inflammatory pseudosarcoma (pseudotumor) of the bladder. Inflammatory pseudosarcoma of the bladder is a rare benign entity that cannot be differentiated from malignant tumor at radiologic examination alone. Only pathologic examination can enable a definitive diagnosis. The authors report two cases of these benign tumors in patients with no history of bladder disease or trauma; the tumors were large, demonstrated invasion into local tissues, and recurred in one case after incomplete transurethral resection. 
1	The gonadotropin-releasing hormone associated peptide reduces calcium entry in prolactin-secreting cells. The precursor molecule to the GnRH contains a peptide named GnRH-associated peptide (GAP) with PRL-inhibiting properties. In this work, we have studied the electrophysiological properties and responses to GAP of three different types of PRL-secreting cells: 1) the rat tumor cell line GH3, 2) normal rat pituitary cells in primary culture, and 3) human PRL-secreting adenoma cells. Using different but complementary techniques we show that GAP reduces intracellular Ca++ levels, [Ca++]i, and inhibits Ca++ transients in these cells. This reduction of [Ca++]i results from coordinate actions of GAP on K+ and Ca++ conductances and may explain the inhibitory effect of GAP on hormonal secretion by PRL-secreting cells. 
1	Nuclear morphometry as a prognostic indicator for genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma: a preliminary investigation. Rhabdomyosarcoma of the urogenital tract is a malignant mesenchymal tumor seen primarily in childhood. Multimodal therapy, encompassing surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, has dramatically improved the survival of patients with this disease. However, the quest for markers of tumor aggression is important to decrease the morbidity of treatment given to patients with good prognosis tumors, while at the same time intensifying treatment of tumors with poor prognosis. Using archival tumor specimens from 13 patients with genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma, a multivariate analysis of multiple nuclear shape descriptors was done with the Hopkins Morphometry System. Three nuclear shape descriptors clearly separated patients with no evidence of disease recurrence or progression from those with recurrent disease, progressive disease or death of disease. These nuclear shape descriptors were standard error of the chain code standard deviation analysis (p = 0.010), range of the feret ellipticity distribution (p = 0.016) and standard error of the chain code range analysis (p = 0.037). With multivariate analysis these shape descriptors taken together separated patients with good and poor prognoses to a level of significance of p = 0.007. Thus, nuclear morphometric analysis may prove to be useful as an individual prognostic indicator in childhood genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma and warrants further analysis in a much larger, blinded, controlled study. 
3	Primary leptomeningeal B-cell lymphoma in a 8-year-old child. A case of primary leptomeningeal B-cell lymphoma in an 8-year-old, previously healthy child is described. The child was found to have hypogammaglobulinemia, and the Epstein-Barr virus genome was identified in cultured tumor cells despite blood serology being negative for the virus. The patient was treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone, plus intrathecal methotrexate, and initially improved. Before the initiation of craniospinal radiation, the patient developed progressive disease, deteriorated, and died 9 months after the onset of symptoms. 
3	Metoprolol for aggressive behavior in persons with mental retardation. Persons with mental retardation sometimes exhibit behaviors that are difficult to control. Use of neuroleptic medications may be limited by side effects or ineffectiveness. Beta blockers such as propranolol and metoprolol have been shown to decrease aggressive and impulsive behaviors in some patients with mental retardation. 
4	Renovascular beta adrenergic hypersensitivity and hyperinsulinemia in rats with dietary-induced obesity. To determine whether obesity alters responsiveness to vasoactive drugs, we compared the cardiovascular effects of angiotensin, phenylephrine and isoproterenol in unanesthetized age-matched control and obese Oscai rats. Obesity was induced by programming pups to overeat immediately after birth and then feeding them a high-fat diet thereafter. Elevations in tail-cuff systolic and mean pressures from 7 through 11 months of age and in plasma insulin at 8 months of age indicated that obese rats had developed borderline hypertension and hyperinsulinemia. Cardiovascular responsiveness was then tested by recording blood pressure, heart rate and renal blood flow from chronically implanted arterial catheters and flow probes while graded doses of the three test drugs were infused intravenously. Heart rate and renal blood flow decreased during pressor responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine and were oppositely increased during depressor responses to isoproterenol. Magnitude of all cardiovascular receptors was dose-dependent. Obese rats had weaker reflex bradycardic responses to angiotensin and phenylephrine than control rats. More importantly, they also had larger renal vasoconstrictor responses to 2 ng/100 g of angiotensin or vasodilator responses to 15 ng/100 of isoproterenol. Whether or not the changes in cardiovascular responsiveness were related to hyperinsulinemia was undetermined. Our results suggest that, in addition to being overweight, slightly hypertensive and hyperinsulinemic, obese Oscai rats have impaired baroreflexes and a renal vascular bed more responsive to beta adrenergic vasodilation. 
3	The effect of sleep on the dyskinetic movements of Parkinson's disease, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, Huntington's disease, and torsion dystonia. The effect of sleep on the involuntary movements or dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, primary and secondary torsion dystonia, and Gilles de la Tourette syndrome was studied in a total of 52 patients and 10 normal subjects using video electroencephalographic telemetry. Movements typical of the wake pattern were seen occasionally during unequivocal sleep in all but two completed studies, and in each condition reappeared under similar circumstances. The movements were most likely to occur after awakenings or lightenings of sleep, or in stage one sleep. The movements were very rare during the deeper phases of sleep. Those movements that occurred during sleep without awakenings were usually preceded by arousal phenomena and, rarely, by sleep spindles or slow waves. The control group showed normal "semipurposeful" movements under the same conditions during sleep. The rare appearance of the different dyskinesias and normal movements under similar circumstances during sleep could be a result of common effects on the generator systems or changes in the excitability of the final common motor pathway. 
2	Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis of the extent of gallbladder carcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively in 39 patients with gallbladder carcinoma. Diagnosis of the anatomical extent of gallbladder carcinoma was compared with histologic analysis, and staging accuracy was evaluated according to the TNM classification. Carcinoma considered to be at an early stage with no lymph node metastasis was correctly diagnosed in 87.5%. Differential diagnosis between early and advanced staged tumors was possible in 79.5%. Overall accuracy for depth of tumor invasion (T) was 76.9%. Limitations were due to many stones in the gallbladder and microinfiltration of carcinoma. Assessment of regional lymph node metastasis (N) was at a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 92.9%, for an overall accuracy of 89.7%. We believe endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the clinical staging of gallbladder carcinoma. 
1	Selective nonoperative management of patients referred with abnormal mammograms. Screening mammography provides a means of detecting clinically occult breast carcinoma, but the question of whether all abnormal mammograms require biopsy remains unanswered. We retrospectively reviewed records of 214 women referred over an 8-year period for abnormal mammograms. They were selectively assigned to biopsy or mammographic follow-up based on specific mammographic criteria. Of 114 women initially observed mammographically, 2 were later found by biopsy to have carcinoma. Initial assignment to mammographic observation delayed the recommendation for biopsy 3 and 12 months, respectively, in these patients, but no effect on outcome was documented. Because they have benign lesions by clinical and mammographic criteria, 102 women (53%) have been spared biopsy; they continue to be monitored closely. We believe these data support the use of a selective approach to biopsy based on specific mammographic criteria. 
4	Accuracy of prospective two-dimensional/Doppler echocardiography in the assessment of reparative surgery. Between January 1987 and January 1989, all 129 patients (aged 11 days to 25 years, median 39 months) undergoing both an echocardiographic examination and cardiac catheterization after reparative surgery were prospectively included in a study to assess the accuracy of combined two-dimensional and Doppler color flow imaging. The patient diagnoses were transposition of the great arteries (n = 20), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 38), coarctation of the aorta (n = 24), complete atrioventricular (AV) canal (n = 15), atrial septal defect (n = 8), ventricular septal defects (n = 3), pulmonary stenosis (n = 4), aortic stenosis (n = 8) and subaortic stenosis (n = 9). In arterial tract stenosis, there was high correlation between Doppler estimates and catheterization-derived measurements of residual right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in patients after the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries (r = 0.95) as well as in patients after corrective repair of tetralogy of Fallot (r = 0.84). In semilunar/AV valve regurgitation, graded as none, mild, moderate or severe, echocardiographic estimates correlated exactly with angiographic grading in 84% and differed by one angiographic grade in the other 16%. In residual left to right shunting, no hemodynamically significant shunt was missed by echocardiography. For residual shunts at the ventricular level (n = 32), addition of Doppler color flow imaging improved the sensitivity (from 63% to 94%) and the negative predictive value (from 88% to 98%). In elevated right ventricular pressure, Doppler-derived right ventricular-right atrial pressure estimates in 24 patients correlated well with catheterization measurements (r = 0.93). Combined two-dimensional and Doppler color flow echocardiography was highly accurate in the prospective evaluation of these four types of postoperative residual. 
4	Combined repair of transposed great arteries and total anomalous pulmonary venous connection. We report an unusual association of transposition of the great arteries and total anomalous pulmonary venous connection in the right atrium that was successfully repaired by a modified Mustard procedure. 
1	Postoperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer. An interim analysis of a prospective, randomized multicenter trial in The Netherlands. The authors assessed the potential benefit of postoperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer in a two-arm, prospective multicenter trial. One hundred seventy-two patients who had undergone surgical resection for rectal adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to either treatment consisting of external irradiation to a dose of 5000 cGy in 5 weeks or a control group (no adjuvant therapy). It was assumed that the number of cells remaining after radical surgery would be low and that the dose of 5000 cGy would be adequate in eradicating the majority of those cells. The number of local recurrences was lower in the treated group of patients, but the difference was not statistically significant. It was assumed that if a significant reduction in the number of local recurrences could be obtained, improved (disease-free) survival would result. No influence on disease-free or overall survival could be detected. These results were in agreement with those reported in Europe and the US, and it was concluded that postoperative radiation therapy alone cannot be justified as a routine procedure in the primary management of resectable rectal cancer. 
4	Surgical management of pheochromocytoma with the use of metyrosine. Despite recommended preoperative preparation with alpha-adrenergic blockers, severe hemodynamic instability may occur during operations to resect pheochromocytoma. We combined the alpha-blocker phenoxybenzamine with the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor metyrosine in an attempt to better manage the hypertension of patients with pheochromocytoma undergoing surgical resection. This report reviews the cases of 25 consecutive patients undergoing surgery for known intra-abdominal pheochromocytoma. Each patient had elevated serum or urine levels of catecholamines or their metabolites. Nineteen patients were prepared before operation with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine and six patients were given phenoxybenzamine alone. There were no significant differences in maximum, minimum, or mean blood pressure before or after tumor resection between patients who received metyrosine and those who did not. However careful review suggested that those who received metyrosine had more severe disease as judged by biochemical criteria. Study of selected patients matched for age and severity of disease suggested that the intraoperative blood pressure management of patients prepared with phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine was facilitated. In addition metyrosine-prepared patients lost less blood and required less volume replacement during surgery than did non-metyrosine-prepared patients. There were no apparent differences in postoperative fluid requirements. Although the study is not a prospective randomized trial, a retrospective review of patients managed with the combination of phenoxybenzamine and metyrosine suggests that surgery to resect pheochromocytoma can be better performed with both drugs than with phenoxybenzamine alone. The combination regimen appears to result in better blood pressure control, less blood loss, and the need for less intraoperative fluid replacement than does the traditional method of single-agent alpha-adrenergic blockade. 
5	Effect of atopy on the natural history of symptoms, peak expiratory flow, and bronchial responsiveness in 7- and 8-year-old children with cough and wheeze. A 12-month longitudinal study. Recurrent lower respiratory tract symptoms are common and disabling in childhood, but little is known of their natural history and relationship to asthma. We report a 12-month longitudinal study designed to determine the influence of atopy on respiratory symptoms and bronchial responsiveness in 7- and 8-yr-old children. A postal questionnaire inquiring into the presence of respiratory symptoms was sent to 3,698 children aged 7 and 8 yr. Those reporting either current wheeze (14.8%) or current cough in the absence of wheeze (12.8%) were randomized, and a sample was invited to attend for skin testing. The following groups of symptomatic children entered the longitudinal study: 48 atopic children with cough, 48 atopic children with wheeze, 48 nonatopic children with cough, and 48 nonatopic children with wheeze. All children recorded twice daily the best of three peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements and completed a 10-point symptom score card, each day for 1 yr. They also recorded all treatment taken and made a note of relevant life events. Each child was seen monthly for general assessment and for measurement of methacholine bronchial responsiveness. Despite the arduous nature of the study 183 of the 192 children (95.3%) successfully completed the 12 months of observation. Symptom groups were compared with regard to FEV1, bronchial responsiveness, symptom chronicity and severity, and diurnal and day-to-day variation in PEF. Atopy was associated with a lower FEV1, increased prevalence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness, greater within-day and between-day variation in PEF, and greater severity of respiratory symptoms compared with the absence of atopy. 
1	Human tumor necrosis factor alpha gene regulation by virus and lipopolysaccharide. We have identified a region of the human tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene promoter that is necessary for maximal constitutive, virus-induced, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced transcription. This region contains three sites that match an NF-kappa B binding-site consensus sequence. We show that these three sites specifically bind NF-kappa B in vitro, yet each of these sites can be deleted from the TNF-alpha promoter with little effect on the induction of the gene by virus or LPS. Moreover, when multimers of these three sites are placed upstream from a truncated TNF-alpha promoter, or a heterologous promoter, an increase in the basal level of transcription is observed that is influenced by sequence context and cell type. However, these multimers are not sufficient for virus or LPS induction of either promoter. Thus, unlike other virus- and LPS-inducible promoters that contain NF-kappa B binding sites, these sites from the TNF-alpha promoter are neither required nor sufficient for virus or LPS induction. Comparison of the sequence requirements of virus induction of the human TNF-alpha gene in mouse L929 and P388D1 cells reveals significant differences, indicating that the sequence requirements for virus induction of the gene are cell type-specific. However, the sequences required for virus and LPS induction of the gene in a single cell type, P388D1, overlap. 
4	Cardiac calcific deposits in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism: preliminary results of a prospective echocardiographic study. To explain the incidence and significance of mitral and aortic valve calcification and calcific deposits in the myocardium, a prospective echocardiographic study was performed with 21 consecutive patients who had primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) and with 21 age- and sex-matched control subjects with normocalcemia. Calcific deposits in the myocardium were seen in 13 patients (62%) with PHP, mainly in the interventicular septum, and in one control subject. Aortic valve calcification was observed in 12 patients (57%) with PHP and in one control subject. Calcification of the mitral valve was found in seven patients with PHP (33%) and three controls (14%). Calcification led to mild or moderate stenosis of the aortic valve in three patients with PHP and of the mitral valve in two patients with PHP. No stenosis was found in the subjects in the control group. Both calcification of the aortic and mitral valves and calcific deposits in the myocardium are common in patients with PHP and can be detected noninvasively by echocardiography. Because of the potential relationship of elevated calcium, calcification, and valvular heart disease, clinical evaluation of PHP should include echocardiographic studies before surgery is performed and during follow-up examination. 
5	The Madigan prostatectomy. A total of 59 patients with bladder outflow obstruction underwent the Madigan prostatectomy. The method, results and complications are described. For select patients with large benign adenomas without a median lobe or hematuria we believe the technique to be the operation of choice, particularly in younger patients. Advantages include absence of postoperative hematuria and clot retention, a decreased requirement for blood transfusions, a 16F postoperative catheter with early removal, avoidance of post-catheter stricture, a low rate of postoperative urinary infection, a short comfortable period of hospitalization and, in the long term (median followup 6 years), preservation of potency and antegrade ejaculation. 
3	Temporal movement control in patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have been reported to be unable to modify their movement velocity to adapt to changing environmental demands. For example, when movement amplitude is varied, PD patients usually exhibit a nearly constant peak velocity, whereas elderly subjects show an increase of their peak velocity with increased amplitude. The experiment examined the ability of PD patients to vary the duration of their movement (four different percentages of their maximum) under conditions where temporal, but not spatial, control was emphasised. PD patients had longer movement times than control subjects, but were able to vary the duration of their movement with comparable temporal accuracy to that of elderly subjects. For both groups, the agonist EMG activity increased with decreased movement duration. For the PD patients, the number of agonist bursts increased with increased movement duration. 
5	Cimetidine 800 mg twice daily for healing erosions and ulcers in gastroesophageal reflux disease. Although H2-receptor antagonists have been the mainstay of therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), none of these agents has been approved by the FDA as effective in healing lesions. Since proton pump inhibitors may be associated with long-term disadvantages, a healing regimen with cimetidine would be useful clinically. This multicenter, randomized, double-blind study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of cimetidine 800 mg b.i.d. in healing lesions and in providing symptomatic relief in patients with ulcerative or erosive esophagitis. Patients with greater than or equal to 8 heartburn episodes during a 1-week screening period, reflux confirmed by esophageal pH monitoring, and esophageal ulcers or erosions confirmed by endoscopy were randomized to treatment with placebo or cimetidine for 12 weeks. Cimetidine provided significantly greater (p less than 0.01) improvement (74% vs. 51%) and complete healing (67% vs. 36%) of esophageal lesions than did placebo. In these patients with erosive or ulcerative esophagitis, the median time to achieve 24 h without heartburn was 13 days with cimetidine and 30 days with placebo (p = 0.01). The mean heartburn severity score in the cimetidine group decreased rapidly during the first week and was consistently lower than in the placebo group. Cimetidine, 800 mg twice daily, is effective in promoting healing of esophageal ulcers and erosions and in providing heartburn relief in patients with symptomatic erosive/ulcerative GERD. 
5	Kawasaki disease: echocardiographic features in 91 cases presenting in the United Kingdom. Ninety-one patients with Kawasaki disease were examined by cross sectional echocardiography between 1980 and 1988. In the 75 patients evaluated during the acute phase of the illness (the first month), the first echocardiographic examination was carried out at a mean time of 16 days (range 5-30) and coronary arterial lesions were seen in 21 (28%). Two patients with medium sized aneurysms had myocardial infarctions, and one died. Coronary arterial lesions persisted in 17 (23%) patients, most often in younger children. The remaining 16 patients were examined from one month to four years after their acute illnesses, and this group did not have coronary arterial abnormalities. Seven patients with coronary artery lesions have reached school age and require regular echocardiographic examination and exercise electrocardiography. Selective coronary arteriography may be indicated in some patients to identify coronary artery stenosis, which the Japanese experience has shown may progress for several years after the acute illness. 
4	Brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic performance in 20 neurologically asymptomatic patients suffering from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (mean age 41 [range 18-49] years) and 20 age-matched controls (mean age 38 [range 28-49] years). Patients exhibited a significantly higher rate of cerebral infarcts (20% versus 0%, p less than 0.05) and cortical (50% versus 5%, p less than 0.01) and ventricular (55% versus 15%, p less than 0.02) atrophy than controls. Accordingly, semiquantitative volumetric measurements yielded a significantly increased ventricular-to-intracranial cavity ratio in the patients (6.2 +/- 2.9% versus 4.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.01). This ratio and the cortical atrophy ratings correlated positively with disease duration (r = 0.63 and 0.54, p less than 0.05). Cognitive test performance was significantly worse in patients than in controls and was most impaired in those patients with morphologic cerebral abnormalities. 
3	Respiratory muscle strength and control of ventilation in patients with neuromuscular disease. To assess the relationship between respiratory mechanics and muscle strength and control of ventilation in patients with neuromuscular disease (NMD), we compared PImax and PEmax at RV, FRC and TLC, total respiratory elastance (Ers) with VT, TI, TT, VE, VT/TI, TI/TT, P.01, and P.01/(VT/TI) effective impedance in 21 patients with NMD and 21 healthy control (C) subjects, in seated position breathing room air. Ers in NMD patients was 79 percent higher than in the C subjects. While TI, TT, and VT in NMD were approximately half the corresponding C values, P.01 was 66 percent greater than in the C subjects (both p less than 0.001). NMD PImax and PEmax ranged from 37 to 52 percent of corresponding C values, respectively. Despite significant respiratory muscle weakness, only 7 of 16 patients demonstrated a PaCo2 greater than 45 mm Hg. Ventilatory output in NMD was modulated by respiratory mechanics as indicated by the increased P.01. In spite of muscle weakness, central drive in patients with NMD is not decreased, and in fact, is often increased. VE is not an accurate measure of central drive because of abnormal intrinsic respiratory mechanics and the effects of conscious responses or reflexes. 
1	Results of conservative surgery and radiation therapy for breast cancer. For stage I or II breast cancer, conservative surgery and radiation therapy are as effective as modified radical or radical mastectomy. In most cases, cosmetic considerations and the availability of therapy are the primary concerns. The extent of a surgical resection less than a mastectomy has not been a subject of a randomized trial and is controversial. It appears that removal of a quadrant of the breast for small lesions is safe but excessive. Using histologic findings in the biopsy as a guide, it may be possible to limit the breast resection to gross tumor removal for most patients while using wider resections for patients with an extensive intraductal component or for invasive lobular carcinoma. It also appears that excluding patients from breast conservation on the basis of positive margins on the first attempt at tumor excision may be unnecessarily restrictive. Although patients with an extensive intraductal component or invasive lobular carcinoma should have negative margins, it appears that a patient with predominantly invasive ductal carcinoma can be treated without re-excision if all gross tumor has been resected and there is no reason to suspect extensive microscopic disease. Patients with indeterminate margins should have a re-excision. Axillary dissection provides prognostic information and prevents progression of the disease within the axilla. Axillary dissections limited to level I will accurately identify a substantial number of patients who have pathologically positive but clinically negative nodes. When combined with radiation therapy to the axilla, a level I dissection results in a limited number of patients with progressive axillary disease. Patients with pathologically positive axillas and patients at particularly high risk for systemic disease because of the extent of axillary node involvement can be identified by dissections of levels I and II. Radiation therapy can be avoided safely in patients who have pathologically negative axillas by level I and II dissection. There appears to be no advantage to routine dissection of level III lymph nodes. Lymphedema of the arm and breast increases with more extensive dissections and with radiation therapy. 
3	Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a pharmacologic study of five cases. Five children with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (epilepsy, acquired aphasia, and continuous spike-wave discharges during sleep), were treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), sleep-modifying drugs, and corticosteroids. The pharmacologic profiles differed from those observed in focal epilepsies, resembling instead those of certain generalized epilepsies, such as West or Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. Phenobarbital (PB), carbamazepine (CBZ), and phenytoin (PHT) were ineffective or worsened the EEG and neuropsychological symptoms, whereas valproate (VPA), ethosuximide (ESM), and benzodiazepines were partially or transiently efficacious. Dextroamphetamine produced a dramatic but transient improvement in waking and sleep EEG in one of two children; aphasia did not change. Corticosteroid treatment resulted in improved speech, suppression of seizures, and normalization of the EEG in three of three children. Our own experience and data from the literature suggest that corticosteroids should be given in high doses as soon as the diagnosis is firmly established and should be continued in maintenance dose for several months or years to avoid escape. Early diagnosis, before mutism or global deterioration develops, appears to be essential for effective therapy with minimal neuropsychological sequelae. 
3	Foci of increased T2 signal intensity in MR images of healthy elderly subjects. A follow-up study. An 18-month follow-up study was conducted on 26 healthy elderly subjects with and without foci of increased T2 signal intensity on MR imaging. The subjects did not differ with respect to health status or cognitive performance as measured by the Cognitive Subscale of the Cambridge Mental Disorders of the Elderly Examination and the Mini Mental State Examination at follow-up. There was a significant decline in performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test in subjects who had evidence of T2 foci compared to the performance of subjects without T2 foci. This may indicate that the presence of T2 foci is correlated with subtle difficulties in learning and memory. 
2	Prevalence of spontaneous hepatofugal portal flow in liver cirrhosis. Clinical and endoscopic correlation in 228 patients. The prevalence of spontaneous reversal of flow in the portal venous system was non invasively evaluated by Doppler ultrasound in 228 patients with liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Reversed flow was detected in the portal vein in 7 patients (3.1%), in the splenic vein in 7 patients (3.1%), and in the superior mesenteric vein in 5 patients (2.1%), with an overall prevalence of 8.3% (19/228). This prevalence did not differ in relation to the etiology of liver cirrhosis, whereas hepatofugal flow was found in more patients classified as Child's C (15.4%) and B (12.5%) than those classified as Child's A (2.7%) (P less than 0.02) and was associated with a higher frequency of hepatic encephalopathy (21% vs. 7.2%; P less than 0.05). Endoscopic evaluation of esophageal varices did not reveal any correlation between the presence and size of varices and hepatofugal flow, whereas red signs were detected more frequently in patients with this hemodynamic pattern (42.1% vs. 24.4%; NS). The rate of previous variceal bleeding was not significantly different in patients with and without hepatofugal flow (30.8% vs. 24.4%; NS). Conversely, the prospective evaluation of 15 patients with hepatofugal flow and 29 matched patients with hepatopetal flow, derived from the group of 228 patients, followed up for a period of 12-18 months, showed that variceal bleeding occurred in 9 of 29 patients with hepatopetal flow and in none of the 15 patients with hepatofugal flow (P less than 0.02). However, no statistical difference was found in the survival rates. This study indicates that the actual prevalence of reversed flow in the portal, splenic, and superior mesenteric veins in a nonselected cirrhotic population is 8.3%. From a clinical point of view, the data suggest that this finding might be considered an important prognostic factor because, while occurring in cirrhotic patients with more severe functional impairment, it might play a protective role against the risk of bleeding. 
1	Hormone replacement therapy and survival after surgery for ovarian cancer OBJECTIVE--To evaluate whether hormone replacement therapy affects survival in women who have undergone bilateral salphingo-oophorectomy because of epithelial ovarian cancer. DESIGN--Retrospective analysis by review of patients' notes and questionnaires completed by general practitioners to compare the overall survival and disease free survival in patients with ovarian cancer who did or did not receive hormone replacement therapy after diagnosis. Data were analysed by Cox regression, with hormone replacement therapy as a time dependent covariate because patients who received hormone replacement did so at different times after diagnosis. SETTING--Gynaecological oncology unit of Royal Marsden Hospital. PATIENTS--373 patients aged 50 years or younger who attended the hospital from 1972 to 1988. All of the women had undergone bilateral salpingoophorectomy for epithelial ovarian cancer. In all, 78 had received hormone replacement therapy, starting at a median of four months after diagnosis. INTERVENTION--A questionnaire was sent to the general practitioners of all patients who were not recorded as having received hormone replacement therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Overall survival and disease free survival. RESULTS--There was no significant difference in survival between women receiving hormone replacement therapy and those not receiving it after accounting for the effects of other known prognostic factors (stage of cancer, differentiation of tumour, histological results, and time to relapse). The relative risk of dying in those who received hormone replacement therapy was 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.44 to 1.20). In addition, there was no significant difference in disease free survival (relative risk in those receiving hormone replacement therapy was 0.90; 95% confidence interval 0.52 to 1.54). CONCLUSIONS--This study shows that hormone replacement therapy is unlikely to have a detrimental effect on the prognosis of patients with ovarian cancer, but this would be shown conclusively only by a randomised controlled trial. 
5	Prevention of complications in surgical management of back pain and sciatica. Accurate diagnosis of lumbar disc disease requires a thorough examination. Appropriate neurodiagnostic studies are required to confirm the suspected diagnosis. Other diagnoses should be considered prior to surgery, especially when there is a lack of correlation between the history, physical examination, or radiologic investigation. Proper surgical techniques should also help in preventing complications and are further discussed in this article. 
2	Cancer chemotherapy after solid organ transplantation. To assess how well chemotherapy is tolerated after solid organ transplantation, we reviewed our experience at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh with five patients aged 1 to 12 years. Four patients had a liver transplant, indications for which were hepatoblastoma in two patients, hepatic failure secondary to Wilms' tumor chemoradiotherapy in one patient, and familial intrahepatic cholestasis in one patient. A fifth patient received a cardiac transplant for unresectable angiosarcoma of the right atrium. After transplant, chemotherapy was given for the treatment of the primary malignancy in four of the patients. The patient with familial intrahepatic cholestasis received chemotherapy for secondary lymphoproliferative disease that had not responded to the cessation of immunosuppression. All patients other than this patient were on immunosuppression with prednisone (0.5 to 2 mg/kg daily) and cyclosporine (to maintain serum levels at 800 to 1000 ng/ml radioimmunoassay) throughout the duration of chemotherapy. Courses of chemotherapy included one or more of the following agents: Adriamycin (Adr, 20 mg/m2 daily, three patients), Cyclophosphamide (Ctx, 1 gm/m2, one patient), cisplatin (CDDP, 90 mg/m2, one patient), Vincristine (Vcr, greater than 0.75 to 1.5 mg/m2, three patients), Actinomycin D (Act-D, 7.5 micrograms/kg, one patient), Ifosfamide (I, 1800 mg/m2, one patient) and Etoposide (VP-16, 100 mg/m2, one patient). All patients received greater than or equal to 3 courses (range, 3 to 9; mean, 5) of chemotherapy every 3 to 4 weeks. Dose reductions were made because of neutropenia in three patients but none were greater than 50%. Severe rejection was seen in one patient who had, however, manifested evidence of rejection prior to his first postoperative course of chemotherapy. No nephro or cardiac toxicity was seen. This preliminary experience suggests that chemotherapy is well tolerated after solid organ transplantation. 
4	Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy without hypertrophy: two families with myocardial disarray in the absence of increased myocardial mass Two families are described in which individuals showed widespread myocardial disarray at histological examination, in the absence of macroscopic cardiac hypertrophy. In one family the clinical presentation was that of sudden unexpected cardiac death in four family members; members of the other family presented with electrocardiographic repolarisation changes and abnormalities of left ventricular diastolic function. The finding of myocardial disarray, the characteristic histological abnormality of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in the absence of increased cardiac mass suggests a wider range of abnormality in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than is currently recognised. 
4	Intravascular laser therapy of acute myocardial infarction. The efficacy of a new method of treatment, endovascular blood irradiation with He-Ne laser, developed by the authors, was studied in 295 patients with primary acute transmural myocardial infarction (MI). Twenty-four-hour Holter monitoring findings before and after laser irradiation suggested the possibility of preventing sudden death in the acute period of MI owing to the high anti-arrhythmic efficacy of the method with respect to high-grade ventricular arrhythmias. Precodial ECG mapping and serial determination of blood enzyme activities (CPK and MB-CPK) showed that irradiation performed within the first hours of MI development contributed to effective limitation of the infarction area and restricted the spread of the area of myocardial ischemic damage. 
5	Results of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of high-risk angulated stenoses. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of angulated stenoses has been found in studies using older PTCA equipment to be associated with a heightened risk of procedure-related major ischemic events. To better understand the factors associated with procedural risk and to identify means of lessening that risk, 100 patients, treated sequentially from 1986 to 1989, who underwent PTCA of stenoses located at greater than or equal to 45 degrees bends, were characterized for 27 clinical, anatomic and procedural variables. Clinical outcome of angioplasty was related to these variables. In addition, results from 344 consecutive contemporary patients undergoing PTCA of nonangulated lesions were compared to those of the study group. Procedural success was achieved in only 70% of patients with angulated stenoses, compared with 306 of 344 (89%) nonangulated stenoses, and major ischemic complications (death, bypass surgery or myocardial infarction) occurred in 13% of patients with angulated stenoses compared with 12 of 344 (3.5%) with nonangulated stenoses (both p less than 0.001). The presence of associated thrombus, stenosis length greater than 10 mm or age greater than or equal to 65 years led to an even higher risk of major complications (9 of 44 = 20.5%), whereas highly experienced angioplasty operators and the use of polyethylene terephthalate balloons appeared to decrease risk and increase the likelihood of success. PTCA of such stenoses should be undertaken only cautiously and in carefully selected patients. 
1	Molecular localization of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation of Ewing sarcoma by chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization. Chromosome translocations are associated with a variety of human leukemias, lymphomas, and solid tumors. To localize molecular markers flanking the t(11;22) (q24;q12) breakpoint that occurs in virtually all cases of Ewing sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma, high-resolution chromosomal in situ suppression hybridization was carried out using a panel of cosmid clones localized and ordered on chromosome 11q. The location of the Ewing sarcoma translocation breakpoint was determined relative to the nearest two cosmid markers on 11q, clones 23.2 and 5.8, through the analysis of metaphase chromosome hybridization. By in situ hybridization to interphase nuclei, the approximate physical separation of these two markers was determined. In both Ewing sarcoma and peripheral neuroepithelioma, cosmid clone 5.8 is translocated from chromosome 11q24 to the derivative chromosome 22 and a portion of chromosome 22q12 carrying the leukemia inhibitory factor gene is translocated to the derivative chromosome 11. The physical distance between the flanking cosmid markers on chromosome 11 was determined to be in the range of 1000 kilobases, and genomic analysis using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed no abnormalities over a region of 650 kilobases in the vicinity of the leukemia inhibitory factor gene on chromosome 22. This approach localizes the Ewing sarcoma breakpoint to a small region on chromosome 11q24 and provides a rapid and precise technique for the molecular characterization of chromosomal aberrations. 
5	Electrophysiology of motor pathways for sphincter control in multiple sclerosis. The central and peripheral motor pathways serving striated sphincter muscle function were studied using cortical and lumbar transcutaneous electrical stimulation, pudendal nerve stimulation and sphincter electromyography in 23 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and sphincter disturbance, including incontinence of urine or faeces, urinary voiding dysfunction, or constipation. The central motor conduction time was significantly increased in the MS group compared to controls (p less than 0.05). Damage to both the upper and lower motor neuron pathways can contribute to sphincter disturbance in MS. The latter may be due to coexisting pathology or to involvement of the conus medullaris by MS. 
1	Can internal mammary chain treatment decrease the risk of death for patients with medial breast cancers and positive axillary lymph nodes? The effect of internal mammary chain treatment on each type of malignant death-related event was analyzed in 1195 patients with operable breast cancer and histologically involved axillary lymph nodes. A group of 135 patients who had no internal mammary chain treatment was compared with a control group of 1060 patients who were treated by surgery and/or postoperative radiation therapy. In a multivariate analysis taking into account age, clinical size of the tumor, histoprognostic grading, and the number of positive axillary lymph nodes, quantitative interaction tests were used to determine whether the effects of internal mammary chain treatment on each type of malignant event were significantly different for patients with a lateral tumor compared with those with a medial tumor. The authors found that the effects of this treatment on the risks of distant metastases and of secondary breast cancer were not the same for the patients with a medial tumor as for those with a lateral tumor. For the untreated patients with a medial tumor, the risks of distant metastases and second breast cancer were, respectively, 1.6 (P = 0.02) and 2.9 (P = 0.02), compared with the treated patients. Conversely, for women with lateral tumor, no difference between the two treatment groups was observed. Thus, internal mammary chain treatment may improve long-term survival rate in patients with a medial tumor and positive axillary lymph nodes essentially by decreasing the risk of development of distant metastases (mainly brain, distant lymph nodes, multiple simultaneous metastases) and/or a secondary breast cancer. 
4	Studies of salt intake in hypertension. What can epidemiology teach us? It has been suggested that small changes in population blood pressure will have a major impact upon the incidence of cardiovascular disease caused by blood pressure elevation. Early reports indicated a close correlation between intercultural differences in salt intake and blood pressure. Before such epidemiological associations can be translated into population advice, certain conditions have to be met. The association has to be validated scientifically, and persuasive evidence has to be produced that the relationship is causal and reversible by changes in salt intake. Further, risk-benefit analysis should indicate that net harm is unlikely. Finally it has to be demonstrated that the population measures being advocated will produce an adequate change in dietary salt intake. The small individual effects upon blood pressure being examined, and the prevailing changes in blood pressure and cardiovascular mortality suggest that data will always fall short of the ideal and therefore that extrapolation will always be necessary. Nevertheless, a review of the present evidence indicates the inadequacies of the available data as a basis for population advice. 
5	Events following implantation of an intraluminal ringed prosthesis in the ascending, transverse, and descending thoracic aorta. From March 1978 through July 1985, 23 patients underwent implantation of 24 intraluminal ringed prostheses (IRP). There were 18 men and 5 women, with a mean age of 54.7 years, range 15-74 years. Eleven IRP were placed in the ascending aorta, two in the transverse arch, and 11 in the descending aorta. Pathology included acute aortic dissection in four patients, chronic dissection in four, and aortic aneurysm in 16. There were eight hospital deaths (35%). Causes of death included acute cardiac failure in seven patients, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in one. IRP complications requiring revision included right coronary artery occlusion in three of 11 patients (27%) with an IRP in the ascending aorta. Graft revision was also required in three of 11 IRP implanted in the descending aorta (27%), due to graft occlusion in one and graft stenosis in two. Of the six patients with IRP complications, there were three hospital deaths (50%). All 15 hospital survivors were followed for a mean of 68.5 months, range 5-112 months. There were four late deaths (26.7%). Causes of late death included hemoptysis in one, cardiomyopathy in one, and aortic redissection and rupture in two. We conclude that patients undergoing repair of aortic pathology with IRP have an important risk of early phase events, as technical problems can occur due to malposition and slippage of the securing rings. 
3	Nocturnal sleep recording with cassette EEG in chronic headaches. Many headache patients complain of poor sleep, and sleep disturbance has been shown to play a role in chronic pain. We recorded nocturnal sleep with a 4-channel cassette EEG monitoring device in 10 common migraine patients, 10 individuals with muscle contraction (tension) headache, and 10 chronic tension-vascular headache sufferers. Migraine patients had essentially normal sleep, although rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and REM latency were increased. Patients with tension headache had reduced sleep time and sleep efficiency, decreased sleep latency but frequent awakenings, increased nocturnal movements, and marked reduction in slow wave sleep, without change in REM sleep or latency. Mixed-element headaches with both tension and vascular features were associated with reduced sleep, increased awakening, diminished slow wave sleep, and REM sleep that was decreased in amount and reduced in latency. The findings suggest that patients with intermittent migraine may have minimal sleep disturbance, while chronic headache may be worsened by chronically poor sleep. Muscle contraction headache may be associated with frequent awakenings and decreased slow wave sleep similar to the sleep changes of fibrositis, while chronic tension-vascular headache may have a depressive substrate. Four-channel sleep recording may miss contributory sleep apnea, but nonetheless cassette EEG may facilitate outpatient evaluation of refractory headaches. 
4	Effect of H1 receptor stimulation on coronary artery diameter in patients with variant angina: comparison with effect of acetylcholine It has been suggested that histamine is involved in the pathogenesis of coronary spasm but its exact role remains unclear. H1 receptor stimulation of the coronary artery was performed with a selective intracoronary infusion of histamine (2 micrograms/min) in 21 patients with variant angina after blockade of the H2 receptor with cimetidine (25 mg/kg) and its effect on the coronary artery diameter was examined. Intracoronary injection of acetylcholine was also performed in 19 of the 21 patients. Ergonovine (0.2 mg) was intravenously administered in one patient. The coronary artery diameter was measured with cinevideodensitometric analysis. A mean plasma histamine concentration in the coronary sinus increased from 4 x 10(-9) to 7 x 10(-8) M 5 min after histamine infusion into the left coronary artery (n = 18). Coronary spasm was induced in 6 patients (29%) with histamine, in 18 (95%) with acetylcholine and in 1 with ergonovine. The effect of histamine on the luminal diameter was analyzed at the site of spasm in the 26 coronary arteries in which spasm was induced by acetylcholine or ergonovine. Of the 20 coronary arteries with a normal arteriogram or a fixed stenosis less than or equal to 50% of luminal diameter, histamine decreased the diameter in 4, increased it in 14 (70%) and caused no change in 2; of the 6 coronary arteries with a fixed stenosis greater than or equal to 75%, histamine decreased the diameter in 5 and increased it in 1. In the coronary arteries in which spasm was not induced by either acetylcholine or ergonovine, histamine increased the diameter, especially in those without advanced atherosclerosis. 
3	Muscle rehabilitation in impaired elderly nursing home residents. Based on observations of changes in muscle function associated with aging, and the exacerbation of these changes with frailty, a program of muscle strengthening has been developed to correct specific defects in muscles. This pilot study was undertaken on 18 functionally impaired nursing home residents (age range 60 to 90 years) with markedly deteriorated muscle function (50%) secondary to age, disuse, and multiple chronic illnesses. Fourteen of the subjects completed the six-week program without adverse effects. In 75% of the patients, there was improved muscle function, with endurance, strength, and speed increasing 35%, 15%, and 10%, respectively. After the program, many subjects increased their spontaneous activity and decreased their dependency. The improvements were still evident four months after rehabilitation. These results suggest that it may be possible, through a carefully supervised, short-term program of muscle rehabilitation, for nursing home residents to achieve an enhanced level of physical functioning. 
1	Transforming function of proto-ras genes depends on heterologous promoters and is enhanced by specific point mutations [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 May 1;88(9):4059] Based on transfection into cells in culture or natural transduction into retroviruses, proto-ras genes seem to derive transforming function either from heterologous promoters or from point mutations. Here we ask how such different events could achieve the same results. To identify homologous regulatory elements, about 3 kilobases of rat DNA upstream of the first untranslated proto-Ha-ras exon was sequenced. Surprisingly, the sequence shares at -1858 a homology of 148 nucleotides with Harvey (Ha) sarcoma virus, 5' of viral ras, signaling possibly a second untranslated proto-Ha-ras exon. In addition the sequence contains a perfect repeat of 25 CA dinucleotides at -2655. A retroviral promoter, even from upstream of the poly(CA), conferred transforming function on proto-Ha-ras and increased transcription greater than 100-fold compared with that of unrearranged proto-ras. Point mutations were not necessary for transforming function of rat and human proto-Ha-ras genes with retroviral promoters but did enhance it greater than 10-fold. A unifying hypothesis proposes that proto-ras genes depend on high expression from heterologous promoters or enhancers for transforming function, which is modulated by ras point mutations. The hypothesis makes two testable predictions. (i) Unrearranged proto-ras genes with point mutations, which occur in some cancers, have no transforming function. Indeed, tumors with mutated proto-ras genes, even those that also lack hypothetical tumor-suppressor genes, are indistinguishable from counterparts with normal proto-ras genes. (ii) Proto-ras genes in transfected cells derive transforming function from heterologous promoters or enhancers acquired via illegitimate recombination from vector DNAs and particularly from viral helper genes that must be cotransfected for transformation of primary cells. Indeed, expression of exogenous proto-ras genes in cells transformed by transfection is as high as for viral ras genes and is much higher than in the cells of origin. 
4	Right ventricular function and metabolism. Right ventricular protection may be limited with current methods of cardioplegic delivery. Sensitive measurements of right and left ventricular function and metabolism were made in 30 patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery with cold cardioplegic arrest. Myocardial adenine nucleotide concentrations decreased with cardioplegia and reperfusion in both the right and left ventricles despite adequate levels of precursors, suggesting perioperative mitochondrial dysfunction. Postoperatively, right and left ventricular pressures were measured with micromanometer catheters and volumes were measured by nuclear ventriculography. Right and left ventricular systolic elastance was calculated by the isochronic method and by the end-systolic method. Both methods provided sensitive indexes of end-systolic elastance. This study demonstrated that right ventricular function and metabolism can be evaluated by methods analogous to methods used in the left ventricle. These results suggest that right ventricular functional and metabolic recovery are delayed despite apparently adequate myocardial protection. Sensitive measurements may permit improved assessment of alternative methods of right ventricular protection. 
5	The auditory P300 event-related potential: an objective marker of the encephalopathy of chronic liver disease. Recently many variants of electroencephalogram-evoked responses have been studied as potential diagnostic aids in the detection and evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy. This study assesses the value of the auditory P300 event-related potential--a slow component of the auditory evoked response--as a tool in this field. Twenty-one nonencephalopathic and 12 encephalopathic (grade 1/2) cirrhotic patients and 26 controls were assessed clinically and psychometrically. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis and visual evoked response recordings were also conducted. An auditory P300 wave was elicited using the standard two-tone discrimination paradigm. The latency and amplitude of this wave were measured. The latency of the P300 was found to be significantly increased in the encephalopathic patients compared with both nonencephalopathic cirrhotic and control groups (p less than 0.05). Amplitude of the wave was decreased in both nonencephalopathic and encephalopathic patients, but this was not statistically significant. This study suggests that the latency of the P300 is a good marker of grades 1 and 2 clinical hepatic encephalopathy. The delays in the P300 latency may indicate that encephalopathic patients have a deterioration of their stimulus evaluation abilities. 
4	Acquired retinal arteriovenous communications in occlusive disease of the carotid artery. Retinal arteriovenous communications proximal to extensive areas of complete vascular closure developed in three patients with occlusive disease of the carotid arteries. In one case, the authors document the development of the arteriovenous communications through successive enlargement of small retinal vessels after progressive signs of retinal ischemia in the form of narrowed retinal arteries, venous dilation and beading, microaneurysms, retinal dot and blot hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, and capillary nonperfusion. The development of arteriovenous communications in carotid occlusive disease has not been described previously. 
2	Cigarette smoking, gastric acidity and peptic ulceration. What are the relationships? The influence of cigarette smoking on intragastric acidity was assessed in duodenal ulcer patients in symptomatic remission and in healthy volunteers in a retrospective study. Continuous 24-hr pH recordings in 150 nonsmokers and 174 smokers receiving placebo treatment were compared. Daytime intragastric acidity was higher in smokers with a median pH (interquartile range) of 1.56 (1.34-1.80) than in nonsmokers, who had a median pH of 1.70 (1.45-1.97) (P less than 0.001). There was no difference in 24-hr and nighttime median pH between the two groups. The small difference in daytime intragastric acidity in smokers and nonsmokers is unlikely to account for the increased prevalence of peptic ulcer disease in smokers. The analysis of smoking status in duodenal ulcer patients and healthy controls and males and females supports the general trend towards higher daytime acidity in smokers. Again, no differences in pH during the 24-hr or night period were found between the groups. The epidemiological and clinical correlation between smoking and duodenal ulcer disease is not adequately explained by increased intragastric acidity. 
3	Continuous regional cerebral blood flow monitoring in acute craniocerebral trauma. Regional cortical cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and intracranial pressure (ICP) were monitored continuously with a combined thermal diffusion probe/ICP monitor in 12 patients (8 men and 4 women; mean age, 31 years; range, 7-65 years) with acute head injuries. The mean Glasgow Coma Scale score at admission was 6 (range, 4-12). The rCBF/ICP probes were placed during surgical procedures (n = 11) or in an intensive care unit (n = 1) for subdural hematomas (n = 7), cerebral contusions (n = 4), and an epidural hematoma (n = 1). No probe-related complications occurred. Reduced CBF often occurred and was often inversely proportional to elevations in ICP. Posttraumatic cerebral arterial vasospasm in one patient was detected by rCBF monitoring and confirmed by angiography. In 6 patients who progressed to brain death, rCBF patterns disappeared, which correlated with their clinical and electroencephalographic examinations. Several patients with severe, diffuse brain injuries and high ICP had hyperemic rCBF patterns. In 2 of these patients, increases in rCBF preceded rises in ICP, which implied loss of autoregulation as a mechanism in the development of malignant cerebral edema. This method of CBF monitoring has not yet been established for clinical decision making. The early detection of ischemic or hyperemic responses by continuous CBF monitoring could hasten intervention aimed at restoring adequate tissue perfusion. The technique could also serve as an index of the efficacy of therapeutic interventions and is suitable to gain more insight into the pathophysiology of head injury, especially the relationship of CBF to ICP. 
4	Occult inferior vena cava thrombosis: diagnosis by sonography--case reports. Ultrasound has become an effective tool for evaluating the inferior vena cava. The authors report 3 cases that illustrate the difficulty in diagnosing partially adherent clots, which may have a high propensity for pulmonary embolism. 
4	Transesophageal echocardiographic features of normal and dysfunctioning bioprosthetic valves. Transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography and color flow Doppler were performed in patients with 42 normal and 20 dysfunctioning bioprosthetic mitral and aortic valves. Transesophageal echocardiography was superior to the transthoracic approach in delineating bioprosthetic valve cusps and the presence of valve thickening due to valve degeneration. In 27 clinically normal bioprosthetic mitral valves, regurgitation was demonstrated in three patients by the transthoracic approach and in seven by transesophageal study. Both transesophageal and transthoracic color flow Doppler demonstrated mitral regurgitation in 17 clinically regurgitant valves. The severity of mitral regurgitation was accurately assessed by the transesophageal study in all 13 patients who underwent angiography, whereas the transthoracic imaging underestimated valvular regurgitation in 7 of the 13 cases (54%). Bioprosthetic aortic valves were normal on clinical examination in 15 patients and were regurgitant in three others. Both transthoracic and transesophageal color flow Doppler were of equal value in observing and quantifying aortic regurgitation. In five clinically normal and regurgitant mitral and aortic valves, transesophageal color flow Doppler revealed eccentric regurgitant jets suggestive of paravalvular leak. This feature was not evident by the transthoracic approach. In conclusion, transesophageal echocardiography and color flow Doppler are superior to transthoracic imaging in estimating bioprosthetic mitral, but not aortic regurgitation, in differentiating valvular from paravalvular regurgitation, and in demonstrating thickened valves due to cusp degeneration. 
4	Syndromes of transient amnesia: towards a classification. A study of 153 cases. Of 153 patients presenting with acute transient amnesia, 114 fulfilled the proposed strict diagnostic criteria for transient global amnesia (TGA). The prognosis of this group was excellent with the exception of a small subgroup (7%), largely identifiable because of atypically brief or recurrent attacks, who developed epilepsy of temporal lobe type on follow up. Computerised tomography (CT) scans performed on 95 patients were normal, evidence for covert alcoholism was lacking and there was a familial incidence of approximately 2%. By contrast, the group of 39 patients who did not meet the criteria for TGA had a significantly worse prognosis with a high incidence of major vascular events. The groups could not be distinguished on the basis of behavioural characteristics during the attack. The following classification was proposed: 1) pure TGA--attacks fulfilling the strict criteria, and of more than one hour in duration which do not require detailed investigation, 2) probable epileptic amnesia--attacks of less than an hour or rapidly recurrent, 3) probable transient ischaemic amnesia, a minority of cases with additional focal neurological deficits during the attack. 
1	Acute myeloid leukemia and background radiation in an expanded case-referent study. A case-referent study that investigated possible associations between environmental and occupational exposures and acute myeloid leukemia was performed on 86 cases and 172 referents, all of whom were living. Exposure information was obtained through a questionnaire mailed to each subject. An association was found between time spent in concrete buildings at home and work and leukemia morbidity. In addition, extensive x-ray examinations that occurred more than 5 y prior to diagnosis were more common among cases than referents. 
5	Clinical and Doppler echocardiographic follow-up after percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty for aortic valve stenosis. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty has been shown to increase the aortic orifice area and to improve clinical symptoms. However, there are only few data concerning long-term results after balloon valvuloplasty. In this study, 36 patients (11 men, 25 women, mean age 75 +/- 8 years) were followed after balloon valvuloplasty for a period of up to 18 months by means of clinical parameters and repeated Doppler echocardiographic measurements after 1, 3, 6, 12 and 18 months. Invasive measurements revealed a decrease of the systolic peak gradient from 78 +/- 24 to 38 +/- 13 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and an increase in the aortic orifice area from 0.58 +/- 0.23 to 0.93 +/- 0.2 cm2 (p less than 0.001). The Doppler echocardiographic approach revealed that the maximal instantaneous gradient decreased from 96 +/- 26 to 67 +/- 22 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). The aortic orifice area increased from 0.49 +/- 0.16 to 0.73 +/- 0.21 cm2 (p less than 0.001). Three patients (8%) died in the hospital. After hospital discharge, 16 patients (44%) died and 8 patients (22%) underwent successful aortic valve replacement after a mean follow-up of 8 +/- 6 months. Nine patients (25%) were alive after a follow-up period of 18 months. Seven of these (19%) remained clinically improved. During follow-up, the Doppler echocardiographic results revealed a continuous trend toward the preprocedural severity of the aortic valve stenosis. Progression of restenosis assessed by Doppler echocardiographic measurements was accelerated in the group of patients who subsequently died or underwent repeat balloon valvuloplasty or aortic valve replacement. 
5	Doppler assessment of pulmonary hypertension induced by hypoxic breathing in subjects susceptible to high altitude pulmonary edema. To verify the abnormal pulmonary vascular response implicated in the pathogenesis of high altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), we examined the hemodynamic responses to hypoxia in HAPE-susceptible subjects (HAPE-S) by means of both right heart catheterization and pulsed Doppler echocardiography. The HAPE-S were seven men and one woman with a history of HAPE. Six healthy volunteers who had repeated experiences of mountain climbing without any history of altitude-related problems served as control subjects. The HAPE-S showed much greater increase in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than did the control subjects, resulting in a much higher level of pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) under acute hypoxia both of 15% O2 and 10% O2. We then evaluated the usefulness of pulsed Doppler echocardiography in the prediction of pulmonary hypertension. Acceleration time (AcT) and right ventricular ejection time (RVET) were measured from the flow velocity pattern in the right ventricular outflow tract. The ratio of AcT to RVET was correlated to invasively determined mean Ppa (Ppa) and PVR. The results were as follows: (1) AcT/RVET = 0.52 to 0.0047 (Ppa), r = -0.93, SEE = 0.017, p less than 0.001 (HAPE-S); (2) AcT/RVET = 0.55 to 0.0055 (Ppa), r = -0.70, SEE = 0.030, p less than 0.001 (HAPE-S); (4) AcT/RVET = 0.52 to 0.00077 (PVR), r = -0.91, SEE = 0.016, p less than 0.001 (control subjects). We conclude that HAPE-S have a constitutional abnormality in the pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia, which is a possible causative factor of HAPE, and that pulsed Doppler echocardiography may be supportive to assess the pulmonary vascular pressor response in the HAPE-S. 
3	Timing of osteosynthesis of major fractures in patients with severe brain injury. A retrospective study was performed to assess the effects on outcome of early osteosynthesis of major extremity fractures in patients with severe brain injury (GCS less than or equal to 7). In a consecutive series of 58 patients, early osteosynthesis was performed on the day of injury in 15 patients. (Group A). In 43 patients no major fractures were present or no early osteosynthesis was performed (Group B). The severity of brain injury as seen on CT scan was similar in both groups. Mortality was significantly lower in Group A, despite a significantly higher ISS. As to the functional end result of brain injury, an indication of a better outcome was present in Group A. 
4	Segmental vascular resistance in postobstructive pulmonary vasculopathy. Chronic unilateral pulmonary arterial ligation has been touted as a model of arteriopathy resulting in a tremendous increase in anastomotic bronchial flow (Qbr) via collaterals. To investigate its effects on the pulmonary vasculature, we ligated the left main pulmonary artery of seven dogs and 120 days later pump perfused their left lower lobes (LLL) via a cannula in the pulmonary artery at pulmonary arterial flow (Qpa) of 250 ml/min. We measured Qbr (330 ml/min) and compared LLL with control contralateral right lower lobes (RLL) and three LLL from normal dogs. Pressure-flow (P-Q) curves were obtained by varying Qpa. With arterial and venous occlusion we measured total, arterial, venous, and middle segment resistances under baseline conditions, after serotonin and histamine, either with or without Qpa and with antegrade and retrograde Qbr. Light microscopy was done postmortem. The slope of the P-Q curve was 33.4 mmHg.l-1.min in the ligated lobes compared with 15.9 in the controls, attributable by the occlusion technique mainly to a rise in arterial resistance (22.4 mmHg.l-1.min compared with 7.4 in the controls) with a small rise in venous resistance. This was explained by significant arterial medial muscle thickening and some loss of LLL volume. The arterial segment was markedly hypersensitive to serotonin, and the venous segment was mildly hypersensitive to histamine compared with controls. The occlusion data also enabled us to model the point of entry of the bronchial circulation into the pulmonary circuit at the precapillary level and to calculate bronchial vascular resistance. We conclude that postobstructive vasculopathy substantially raises pulmonary vascular resistance, mainly upstream from the site of entry of the bronchial circulation. The role of the latter may be to keep it from rising excessively in the segments it perfuses, i.e., the middle and venous ones. 
3	Severe fibromyalgia after hypophysectomy for Cushing's disease. We report a case of fibromyalgia occurring after hypophysectomy for Cushing's disease. Clinical examination revealed tender points at 12 of the 18 tender point sites described in the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of fibromyalgia. The cause of fibromyalgia remains unknown. In our patient, hypophysectomy may have played a role by disturbing endorphin secretion and pain modulation. 
1	Immunohistochemical characterization of microvascular endothelial cells in primary B cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract. Microvascular endothelial cells (EnC) in primary B cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract were immunohistochemically studied. Based on the morphological structure, the microvasculatures were divided into high endothelial cell vessels (HEV) and flat endothelial cell vessels (FEV). There were distinct phenotypic differences between HEV and FEV in lymphoma tissues. HEV were characterized as OKM1- OKM5-, accompanied by the cluster of non-neoplastic T lymphocytes, and FEV were OKM1- OKM5+ not accompanied by T lymphocyte infiltration. Factor VIII-related antigen was clearly identified in both EnC, and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens and interleukin 1 were absent or only faintly visible on EnC in lymphoma tissues, whereas they were expressed on EnC in non-lymphoma tissues. These findings suggest that microvascular EnC in primary B cell lymphoma of the gastrointestinal tract lack a property as antigen-presenting cells, and that HEV are involved in the migration of non-neoplastic T lymphocytes. 
2	Pathophysiologic changes in the critically ill patient: risk factors for ulceration and altered drug metabolism. Virtually all patients who are under the physiologic stress of an intensive care unit (ICU) are vulnerable to stress-related mucosal damage and ulceration. Although clinically significant hemorrhage from stress ulceration occurs in only 5-20 percent of patients in the ICU, the associated mortality is greater than 50 percent. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of stress ulcer are not well understood; however, a number of risk factors such as intraluminal gastric acidity and mucosal ischemia have been implicated. To prevent the development of stress ulcers and subsequent complications, it is important to identify and correct these underlying risk factors. Improving mucosal blood flow (i.e., fluid resuscitation and low-dose dopamine) and providing adequate nutritional support are invaluable adjuncts in minimizing the risk of stress ulcer formation. The use of pharmacologic prophylaxis controls the gastric acidity and prevents the formation of stress ulcers. The potential for drug-induced adverse effects and drug-drug interactions are of particular concern in the care of critically ill patients. Multiple organ system dysfunction or failure, malnutrition, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, as well as the use of multiple pharmacologic agents predispose these patients to alterations in drug pharmacokinetics, drug-induced adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. These changes may alter the pharmacodynamic response to therapy and must be considered when designing drug dosage regimens for critically ill patients. 
4	Enalapril-associated anemia in renal transplant recipients treated for hypertension. We encountered a renal transplant recipient who developed an unexplained 0.09 decrease in hematocrit value while taking enalapril for hypertension, which reversed when the drug was stopped. This experience, and a previous similar case report, prompted a review of all our 27 transplant patients treated with enalapril. Of these, 10 patients (37%) had developed an otherwise unaccounted for anemia: the pre-enalapril hematocrit value was 0.42 +/- 0.01 and it decreased to the nadir value of 0.33 +/- 0.01 (P less than 0.001) within 12.3 +/- 0.9 weeks after initiation of 9 +/- 2.4 mg of enalapril daily; enalapril was stopped in seven patients and their anemia resolved within 9.1 +/- 0.7 weeks to a final hematocrit value of 0.40 +/- 0.01. The remaining three patients were maintained on enalapril at their physicians' discretion, without further decrease in hematocrit values. No appreciable changes in drug regimens, clinical course, or other laboratory parameters were noted during this period. A causal relationship between enalapril and anemia was suggested by the effect of drug withdrawal and rechallenge on hematocrit in one of the patients. There were no statistically significant differences in baseline clinical and laboratory characteristics between those patients who did (group I) and those who did not (group II) develop enalapril-associated anemia, with the exception of a normal hematocrit value of 0.42 +/- 0.01 in group I versus a lower hematocrit value of 0.36 +/- 0.02 in group II (P less than 0.05). We conclude that enalapril should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anemia following renal transplantation. Susceptibility to this effect might emanate from the immunosuppressed state. 
1	Strategy for breakpoint cluster region analysis in chronic myelocytic leukemia in a routine clinical laboratory. Despite the increasing reliance on breakpoint cluster region (bcr) determinations in diagnosis of chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), few reports have dealt with the practical aspects of specimen analysis. In the setting of a routine molecular diagnostics laboratory, samples from 68 patients with active CML were evaluated for bcr rearrangements, with the use of a variety of enzymes and two probes. The data have been used to develop an efficient strategy for bcr screening and breakpoint determination. Screening with the universal bcr (UBCR) probe on Xba I and BgI II digests yielded bcr rearrangements in 100% of the Ph1-positive patients and three of the seven Ph1-negative patients, giving bcr analysis a sensitivity of 100%. A single-enzyme screen using the UBCR probe would have resulted in a false negative rate of 10%. The false negative rate was determined during the breakpoint site analysis from additional digests hybridized to both the 3' and UBCR probes. The false negative rate for the 3' probe was 26.5%, because of deletions or 5' rearrangements. The method of breakpoint site determination was dependent on screening results. In 78% of cases, one additional hybridization with two enzyme digests was required. During breakpoint site analysis, a rare false negative result was also demonstrated with Bam HI and Eco RI. This screening strategy has made bcr analysis competitive with cytogenetic analysis at the authors' institution; although turnaround time may be slightly longer, bcr analysis can yield information (such as detecting bcr-positive/Ph1-negative patients and determining breakpoint site) that cannot be obtained by cytogenetics. 
1	Calcifications in breast biopsy specimens: discrepancies in radiologic-pathologic identification. To analyze the effectiveness and accuracy of the diagnostic process from screening mammography to final diagnosis at pathologic examination, the authors conducted a prospective study of 277 consecutive patients who underwent 291 mammographically directed biopsies of nonpalpable lesions. Of the 170 lesions that demonstrated findings consistent with calcification on preoperative mammograms and radiographs of specimens, 12 (7.1%) were not described by the pathologist as being calcified. These discrepancies were due to inadequate sampling in three cases (25%), lack of explicit description by the pathologist in four (33%), presence of oxalate crystals that required examination with polarizing lenses in two (17%), and unexplained loss of tissue probably related to processing in three (25%). Of the 121 lesions that did not demonstrate findings consistent with calcification at radiography, eight (6.6%) were described as calcified by the pathologist. The authors recommend a protocol for avoiding these discrepancies that involves performance of a more comprehensive examination of histologic sections by the pathologist, including the use of polarizing lenses, if necessary, and radiographic reexamination of paraffin-embedded tissue blocks with subsequent step sectioning by the pathologist when results are positive. 
5	Central venous oxygen saturation: a useful clinical tool in trauma patients. An accurate method of estimating acute blood loss is essential in the evaluation of injured patients. Central venous oxygen (CVO2) saturation has been shown to be a sensitive and reliable correlate of blood loss in an animal model but its clinical validity is unproven. We evaluated 26 consecutive patients with an injury mechanism suggesting blood loss but who were deemed stable after initial evaluation. Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, pulse pressure, urine output, CVP) and CVO2 saturation were serially measured. Blood loss was estimated by direct intracavitary collection or serial hematocrits and acute transfusion requirements. Despite stable vital signs, ten patients (39%) had CVO2 saturations under 65%. These patients had more serious injuries, significantly larger estimated blood losses, and required more transfusions than those patients with CVO2 saturation greater than 65%. Linear regression analysis demonstrated the superiority of CVO2 saturation to predict blood loss with a p value less than 0.005 relative to any of the normally followed parameters. CVO2 saturation is a reliable and sensitive method for detecting blood loss. It is a useful tool in the evaluation of acutely injured patients. 
5	Correlations between vertebral regional bone mineral density (rBMD) and whole bone fracture load. To assess the significance of regional quantitative computed tomography measurements of bone density with respect to mechanical strength in the human lumbar spine, 58 vertebrae (from 12 males, 10 females) were scanned in vitro with multiple-thin-slice quantitative computed tomography and then compressed to fracture. With computer graphics, 18 specific regions of physical density and 10 combination averages of density were identified within each vertebral body. To ensure the statistical independence of data, the individual vertebral specimens were assigned to one of three groups (T11-L1, L2-L3, or L4-L5). Use of best-subsets procedures resulted in regression models to predict fracture strength. These models used specific regional density values and often the age and sex of the donors. The correlation coefficients that resulted from the multiple regression models ranged from r = 0.88 to r = 0.95. When the density values were multiplied by the minimum cross-sectional area of the vertebral body, similar regional density averages were selected, and the predictive values were slightly improved (r = 0.94-0.97). The heterogeneity of the density samples (measured as standard deviation) in multiple regression fashion also produced strong correlation coefficients (r = 0.88-0.94). The bone density in an anterior cylinder of the midplane region, the location measured most often in quantitative computed tomography densitometry, was strongly correlated (r = 0.85) to fracture load for the T12-L1 group (N = 20), but was not significant for the other two groups of vertebrae. The cancellous bone density from the female data was not found to be significantly different from the male data set. 
5	Reoperation for biliary strictures. Benign bile duct strictures most often follow intraoperative injury not recognized until later. The ideal reconstruction entails a mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis without tension, usually with a stent tube to maintain patency in the immediate postoperative period. The mortality rate for reoperation and bile duct reconstruction in patients who are not cirrhotic is approximately 2%, and success rates average 85%. Prevention of operative injuries by the use of cholangiography, careful dissection, and removal of the gallbladder from the fundus downward is the best treatment. 
1	Potentiation of the erythropoietin response by dimethyl sulfoxide priming of erythroleukemia cells: evidence for interaction of two signaling pathways. Erythropoietin (Epo) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are believed to induce the differentiation of transformed erythroid cells by different signal transduction pathways. We have now obtained evidence for the interaction of these pathways. We used a Rauscher murine erythroleukemia cell line with a relatively low (8% to 10%) hemoglobinization response to Epo alone. Pretreatment of these cells for 1 day with DMSO followed by its removal and the addition of Epo resulted in a marked enhancement of the Epo specific hemoglobinization. We have designated this effect "DMSO priming." This priming effect of DMSO on the Epo response was both time-dependent and DMSO concentration-dependent. DMSO priming potentiated the Epo response in three ways. Firstly, DMSO priming increased the total number of Epo responsive cells from 8% to 10% to 40% to 60%. Secondly, DMSO priming reduced the time required to reach the optimal Epo-induced response from 4 days to 2 days. Thirdly, the Epo dose-response curve was left-shifted approximately 20-fold. DMSO priming was also associated with a marked increase in Epo receptor density characterized by an apparently new receptor population and by the appearance of positive cooperativity between receptors. Our results suggest that the DMSO priming effect is due to potentiation of the Epo signaling pathway, thus resulting in a much more rapid and dramatic Epo-induced hemoglobinization response. 
1	Lipiodol computerized tomography: how sensitive and specific is the technique in the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma? Computerized tomography (CT) following the intra-arterial injection of Lipiodol (Lipiodol-CT) was performed on 60 patients suspected of having a hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Four main patterns of uptake of the Lipiodol within the liver were seen on CT. Of the 14 well circumscribed lesions with dense homogeneous uptake of Lipiodol, 13 were confirmed to be HCCs. Of the 25 lesions with dense patchy uptake of Lipiodol at the periphery and/or in the centre, 19 were confirmed to be HCCs. In 18 patients, in whom only ill defined faint patchy uptake of Lipiodol was present in the liver, or in whom no hepatic uptake was present at all, only one patient was found later to have an HCC. Of the three hypodense lesions in the liver with no Lipiodol uptake, one was found to be necrotic HCC, one a cholangiocarcinoma and one a regenerative nodule. In the diagnosis of HCC, Lipiodol-CT had an overall sensitivity of 97.1%, an accuracy of 88.3% and a specificity of 76.9%. Of the 34 patients with HCC, only 23 were solitary at diagnosis. The size of the HCCs ranged from 0.8 cm to 11 cm in diameter with the median size at 2.2 cm. Eleven of 34 HCCs (32.3%) were resectable. We conclude that, as part of a screening programme for high risk patients. Lipiodol-CT is useful in the early detection of HCCs. The technique also plays an important role in determining whether the tumour should be resected or managed with chemotherapy. By detecting HCCs while still small, the resectability rate can also be improved. 
5	Secondary femoral-distal bypass. Thirty-nine secondary femoral-distal (femorotibial and femoroperoneal) bypasses were reviewed and compared to 89 primary femoral-distal bypasses (done during the same time period) to investigate the efficacy of secondary femoral-distal bypass. Graft patency at 2 years by life table analysis was similar in both groups (38% primary group vs 36% secondary group). However, limb salvage was significantly less in the secondary group (52% vs 68% at 2 years, p less than 0.05). This decrease was primarily due to poorer limb salvage using composite grafts (prosthetic/vein) compared to vein grafts in patients who underwent secondary femoral-distal bypasses (37% vs 76% at 2 years, p less than 0.05). Postoperative wound infections and mortality were similar in both groups. Thus, femoral-distal bypass after failure of a previous infrainguinal reconstruction offers good long-term limb salvage with acceptable surgical risk when autologous vein is available for use as the arterial conduit. 
1	Administered dose and tumor dose of bleomycin labeled with cobalt-57 in mice and men. Tumor concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drug, bleomycin, labeled with cobalt-57 (Co-bleo) were compared in mouse tumor models and in human lung tumors using quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography. Drug concentrations in histologically similar human tumors showed marked variability for the same injected dose (ID). Small cell carcinomas showed concentrations between 1.09 and 8.85 %ID/cc x 10(-3) while non-small cell lung tumors showed a concentration variation between 0.36 and 6.75 %ID/cc x 10(-3). In contrast to the situation in human tumors, uptake in mouse tumors showed only slight variability in animals with the same tumor model. EMT-6 tumors in mice showed at 6 hr significantly higher uptake of Co-bleo (p less than 0.001) and significantly higher tumor-to-lung ratio (p less than 0.001) when compared to murine fibrosarcomas. The EMT-6 tumors in contrast to the fibrosarcomas responded to bleomycin treatment in a dose dependent manner. The results indicate that while in mice the tumor dose closely follows the administered dose, in humans, the tumor dose and the tumor-to-lung ratio in the individual patient cannot be predicted from the administered dose. 
5	Accumulation of p21ras.GTP in response to stimulation with epidermal growth factor and oncogene products with tyrosine kinase activity. The ras gene product (p21) is a GTP-binding protein and has been thought to transduce signals regulating proliferation or differentiation of cells. Like other GTP-binding proteins, p21.GTP is an active conformation, which can transduce the signals downstream, whereas p21.GDP is an inactive one. Recently, we have shown that p21.GTP levels increased in cells treated with fetal bovine serum or platelet-derived growth factor to initiate DNA synthesis. In this paper, we report that epidermal growth factor can also increase the amounts of p21.GTP in the cells. Effects of epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor are not additive. In contrast, mutant [Val12]p21, which has transforming activity, responded neither to platelet-derived growth factor nor to epidermal growth factor. We also found that the ratio of p21.GTP to p21.GDP increased 3- to 4-fold in transformants carrying activated erbB-2/neu or v-src oncogenes. These results strongly suggest an important role of p21 in transduction of signals for both normal proliferation and malignant transformation through growth factor receptors with tyrosine kinase activity or related oncogene products. 
5	Milk protein enteropathy after acute infectious gastroenteritis: experimental and clinical observations. Animal models of allergic gastroenteropathy have defined both morphologic and physiologic changes that accompany the immune-mediated reaction to a dietary protein. In such models a broadening of the allergic response to other dietary proteins present in the gastrointestinal tract may occur during the localized anaphylactic reaction. The characteristic histologic intestinal findings of food protein-induced enteropathy may develop in selected infants with protracted diarrhea after infectious enteritis. Mechanisms underlying the induction of this response remain to be explained, but they may in part be similar to the broadening of the hypersensitivity response seen in experimental models of allergic enteropathy. 
5	Upper-airway obstruction after multilevel cervical corpectomy for myelopathy. We reviewed the cases of seven patients who had had obstruction of the upper airway immediately after an anterior procedure on the cervical spine and had required reintubation. All patients had had moderate or severe myelopathy preoperatively (average, 3.6 on the Nurick scale), and all had had a multilevel anterior cervical corpectomy for decompression followed by arthrodesis. The early compromise of the upper airway was believed to be due to edema rather than to the formation of a hematoma. Five patients had no sequelae, but two died of complications related to the obstruction. Risk factors common to these patients included moderate or severe myelopathy and multilevel corpectomy. Six patients had a history of heavy smoking and one, of asthma. We believe that extra caution should be used in the postoperative management of the airways when multilevel corpectomy is performed in patients who have these pre-existing conditions. 
5	Postoperative irrigation-suction drainage after pelvic colonic surgery. A prospective randomized trial. A 2-year randomized prospective clinical trial was undertaken to determine whether postoperative irrigation of the pelvis would result in a decreased incidence of local septic complications. Two hundred consecutive patients undergoing low pelvic procedures with rectal resection and entry of the presacral space by a single surgeon, were randomized. In the irrigation group, two of four presacral sump drains were placed to low intermittent suction and the remaining sumps infused continuously with saline until the effluent was clear. In the drainage alone group, all four presacral sump drains were placed to suction. Drains were removed when drainage was less than 50 ml/24 hours. Perioperative antibiotics and bowel preparation were identical. Postoperative complications included pelvic abscess (n = 7), anastomotic leak/cuff sinus (n = 11), abdominal wound infection (n = 19), and perineal wound infection (n = 5). Postoperative irrigation of the pelvis did not result in a reduction in the overall rate of local pelvic septic complications. Positive intraoperative presacral cultures, the presence of anaerobes in the presacral space, and duration of pelvic drainage had no effect on the development of pelvic sepsis. 
2	The diagnosis and definition of hepatic malignancies by use of arterial enhanced computerized tomographic scanning. Axial computerized tomography is a useful tool in the evaluation of either primary or metastatic hepatic neoplasms. An adjunct to this technique is visceral arterial enhanced computerized tomography (AECT). To determine the effectiveness of this modality, bolus intravenous enhanced computerized tomography scans and AECT were compared and correlated to operative findings. Fifty-four consecutive patients were evaluated by AECT and bolus intravenous enhanced computerized tomography over a 30-month period (May 1986 to August 1989) for suspected primary or metastatic hepatic malignancies. Forty-four patients (81%) had hepatic lesions. Fifty-two percent (23 of 44 patients) of the metastatic tumors were from colonic or rectal primary lesions, and 20% were hepatocellular primary lesions. The remainder of the lesions were metastases from a variety of primary lesions. When studies were compared, 34% of the patients (15 of 44 patients) differed in either the location or total number of lesions noted. The lesions of three of the 15 patients (20%) were determined unresectable on the basis of AECT. Of the remaining patients, planned resections were revised in seven patients to either lesser or greater procedures. The number of lesions found at laparotomy equaled the number found by AECT in all but two cases. AECT caused no complications. AECT improved our ability to identify and localize primary and metastatic lesions of the liver. This technique offers the advantage of preoperative definition of the hepatic arterial and portal venous anatomy. 
4	Exercise thallium-201 scintigraphy in the diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery disease. OBJECTIVE: To determine the discriminant accuracy of exercise thallium-201 myocardial perfusion scintigraphy for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. DATA IDENTIFICATION: A survey of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database. STUDY SELECTION: The key medical subject headings used were coronary disease, myocardial infarction, radionuclide imaging, and thallium. A total of 122 retrieved studies were considered relevant and were reviewed in depth. DATA EXTRACTION: Only studies reporting both the sensitivity and specificity of thallium scintigraphy were analyzed. RESULTS: Discriminant accuracy for diagnosis and prognosis was summarized in terms of pooled sensitivity and specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise thallium scintigraphy is useful in the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease, especially in patients with abnormal resting electrocardiograms, restricted exercise tolerance, and intermediate probability of having disease at the time of testing as well as of defining the prognosis of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, especially in those with previous myocardial infarction. Because of various shortcomings in the published record, however, the marginal discriminant accuracy and cost effectiveness of thallium scintigraphy compared with conventional clinical assessment and exercise electrocardiography remain controversial. 
4	Recanalization of chronic, totally occluded coronary arteries by new angioplasty systems. The benefit and safety of new angioplasty equipment as compared with the conventional guidewire approach was evaluated in 154 consecutive patients. with chronic, totally occluded coronary arteries. The protocol followed a stepwise design: first, conventional guidewires and low-profile balloons were used, followed by "balloon-on-the-wire" systems (Probe, Ace) or by a shaft-enforced, tip-deflecting catheter (Omniflex). In 97 patients with occlusions of 2 to 12 weeks' duration, recanalization was achieved in 51 patients (53%) with the conventional approach and in 29 patients with the new devices (balloon-on-the-wire [n = 5], Omniflex [n = 24]), thereby raising the success rate to 82%. In 57 occlusions of greater than 12 weeks' duration, the recanalization attempt was successful in 58%, mediated in 16 patients (28%) by the Omniflex catheter and in 5 patients by balloon-on-the-wire systems. There were no life-threatening complications and only 1 (0.6%) emergency bypass operation was necessary. New angioplasty devices are therefore of considerable value in the attempt to improve the results of coronary angioplasty in chronic total occlusions. 
1	Clinical observation on the association of gallstones and colorectal cancer. A possible association between gallstones, colorectal cancer, and gastric cancer was investigated. The age distribution and mean age of the two cancer groups were identical. The incidence of gallstones in 378 colorectal cancer cases and 869 gastric cancer cases was 7.1% and 5.5%, respectively. Of colorectal cancer cases, 33 cases with multiple carcinomas had a significantly higher gallstone incidence than cases with a solitary carcinoma--24.2% and 5.5%, respectively. The mean age was 5 years older in gallstone cases than in those without gallstones in both cancer groups, and it was 4 years older in multiple-carcinoma cases than in solitary-carcinoma cases in the colorectal cancer group. These results suggest that the higher levels of same causative factors (i.e., dietary fat) are associated with a longer duration of gallstone formation and colorectal cancer development as demonstrated by multiple colorectal-carcinoma cases. 
2	Intrahepatic cholesterol stones: a rationale for dissolution therapy. A case of primary cholesterol hepatolithiasis is reported. Stone composition was documented by infrared spectroscopy, and the presence of cholesterol saturated bile was demonstrated using standard biochemical techniques. The patient was treated with operative stone extraction, choledochoscopy, biliary enteric anastomosis, and oral dissolution therapy. The administration of oral dissolution agents has altered the composition of the patient's bile and may prevent further stone formation. We advocate the use of both stone and biliary biochemical analysis for patients with primary hepatolithiasis to facilitate optimal therapy. 
4	Safety and efficacy of urokinase during elective coronary angioplasty. Eighty-nine of 462 patients were treated with adjunctive urokinase during elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), 26% for unstable angina, 34% for intracoronary thrombus, 27% for intimal dissection, 10% for abrupt closure, and 3% for saphenous vein graft embolism. The 80 patients treated before abrupt closure (group A) were compared with 167 patients with similar profiles who did not receive urokinase (group B). Procedural success rates were similar. Adverse cardiac events (abrupt closure, myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass, or death) in group A versus group B occurred in: 1 of 30 (3%) versus 5 of 27 (18.5%) (p = 0.07) with intracoronary thrombus, 5 of 45 (9%) versus 18 of 110 (16.3%) with unstable angina, 1 of 12 (8%) versus 4 of 13 (31%) with unstable angina with intracoronary thrombus, 4 of 33 (12%) versus 14 of 97 (14.4%) with unstable angina without intracoronary thrombus, and 5 of 24 (20.8%) versus 6 of 66 (9%) with intimal dissection. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 11% of patients who were treated with urokinase versus 9% of patients who were not (p = NS). No difference in blood transfusions existed. Thus urokinase was found to be safe during elective PTCA. In patients with intracoronary thrombus, urokinase appears to decrease the incidence of new adverse cardiac events, whereas in patients with intimal dissection it might have an adverse effect. 
1	Analysis of bladder carcinoma by subsite. Cystoscopic location may have prognostic value. Nine hundred fourteen cases of carcinoma of the urinary bladder registered from 1977 to 1988 with the Kansas state tumor registry were evaluated by subsite for differences in grade, histology, sex, age at diagnosis, and survival. Only initial occurrences of carcinoma were included. Carcinoma of the lateral walls accounted for 37.1%; the posterior wall, 17.9%; the trigone, 12.6%; the neck, 11.1%; the ureteric orifices, 9.8%; the dome, 7.7%; and the anterior wall, 3.8%. Malignant neoplasms occurring in the neck of the bladder had a significantly poorer prognosis by survival analysis (P less than 0.05). Malignancies of the dome were found to present as higher grade lesions (P = 0.00003), and carcinoma of the ureteric orifices and lateral walls tended to be of lower grade (P = 0.02 and P = 0.05, respectively). Carcinomas of the anterior wall and dome occurred in a more elderly population (mean ages, 75.6 and 73.9 years, respectively), and carcinomas of the trigone and ureteric orifices occurred in a younger group (mean ages, 68.3 and 67.5 years, respectively). On histologic evaluation the trigone gave rise to more squamous cell carcinoma than expected (P = 0.001, 325% of expected). No distribution difference was noted among subsites with respect to sex. These data show significant differences among subsites of the urinary bladder with regard to survival, grade, histology, and age at diagnosis. 
5	Hypergastrinemia, gastric endocrine cell hyperplasia, and intractable diarrhea. A patient with pernicious anemia developed severe intractable diarrhea night and day. Investigation revealed chronic atrophic gastritis and a markedly elevated level of serum gastrin. No obvious explantation for the diarrhea was found, but after antrectomy, the gastrin level returned to normal and the diarrhea subsided. Possible mechanisms for an association between diarrhea and hypergastrinemia include colonic hypermotility secondary to release of acetylcholine and inhibition of fluid and electrolyte reabsorption within the small bowel. 
5	Evolution of in vitro transformation and tumorigenesis of HPV16 and HPV18 immortalized primary cervical epithelial cells. Cervical carcinoma develops through a progressive spectrum of premalignant intraepithelial lesions (CIN I-III), the majority of which are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18. We established HPV16 and HPV18 immortalized human cervical epithelial cell lines and used them as a model to investigate the genesis and progression of cervical malignancy. The cell lines when cultured in vitro in a system mimicking their in vivo environment exhibit cytologic atypia and a variety of defects in morphologic differentiation at early passage compared to their normal counterparts. With increased passage, these alterations progress to more severe grades, histologically similar to CIN III; however only a limited number of the cell lines are tumorigenic, mimicking the epidemiologic evidence on the rate of conversion from premalignant to invasive carcinoma. The observed changes are not associated with alterations of viral DNA integration or expression and may reflect specific cellular events or changes in virus-host interactions associated with malignant progression. 
1	Long-term sequelae of conservative treatment by surgery, brachytherapy, and chemotherapy for vulval and vaginal rhabdomyosarcoma in children. Between 1970 and 1978, 17 girls with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) of the vulva or vagina were treated at the Institut Gustave-Roussy (IGR) by conservative treatment including surgery, brachytherapy, and chemotherapy. Twelve pubescent or postpubescent girls were studied for long-term sequelae. Eleven of 12 patients have had a normal puberty, two have a total of three healthy children, 11 have normal menses, and 10 normal menarche (one after hormonal replacement). Only one patient underwent hysterectomy following low-dose brachytherapy. Five girls have no vaginal complications, and three are sexually active. Three have had minimal vaginal sequelae, which required surgical correction to permit sexual intercourse. Four girls sustained serious sequelae (colorectal, vaginal, urethral, and ureteral stenosis). These sequelae, secondary to irradiation, are potentially avoidable in the future given the current advances in brachytherapy and improvements in dosimetry. This conservative treatment is useful and appropriate for girls with RMS of vulvar or vaginal origin when complete remission cannot be obtained with chemotherapy and partial colpectomy. 
3	Maple syrup urine disease caused by a partial deletion in the inner E2 core domain of the branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex due to aberrant splicing. A single base deletion at a 5'-splice donor site of an intron of the E2 gene disrupts the consensus sequence in this region. We have studied the molecular bases of maple syrup urine disease by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and the genome of the affected enzyme. The branched chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) activity in the patient was 4.2-4.5% of the control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E2 subunit of BCKDH (Mr 52,000) was absent and another protein band with an Mr of 49,000 was present. We amplified the cDNA of the E2 subunit obtained from the patient's cell using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNA, in which a 78-bp deletion was identified. The consanguineous parents and a sister had two species of mRNA; the one corresponding to the normal E2 subunit and the other with a 78-bp deletion, whereas findings in a brother were normal. The molecular size of the translation products as deduced from the abnormal mRNA sequence was compatible with an abnormal protein band (Mr 49,000) detected in the patient's cells by immunoblot analysis. Analysis of genomic DNA of BCKDH-E2 subunit revealed that the 78-bp deletion in the mRNA was caused by an exon skipping due to a single base deletion in the 5'-splice donor site. As a result of the mutation, part of the inner E2 core domain was omitted. The specified region of the inner E2 core domain was highly homologous to the region of the E2 subunit of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. These observations imply the biological importance of the region in the inner E2 core domain of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the activity. 
4	Free-tissue transfers for limb salvage utilizing in situ saphenous vein bypass conduit as the inflow. Using vein grafts to bypass sclerotic and occluded arterial segments is a well-established technique in vascular surgery. For infrapopliteal bypass, autogenous veins have better patency rates than synthetic grafts. Although not resolved, in situ bypasses seem to be better than reversed bypasses, especially for "far away" segments. Although the etiology is not understood, it is a well-known clinical finding that sclerosis affects arteries more than the veins and, as a whole, is more advanced in lower extremities compared with the trunk and upper extremities. Our experience with eight patients in whom critical soft-tissue defects were covered with free-tissue transfers in severely compromised lower extremities utilizing the in situ saphenous vein bypass as the inflow is presented. Simultaneous bypass and free-tissue transfers were performed in seven and delayed free-tissue transfer was done in one. Follow-up ranged from 6 months to 3 years. To date, two patients underwent amputations. Five patients are able to maintain bipedal ambulation. One patient is wheelchair-bound with intact lower extremities. In well-selected patients, this procedure may offer an alternative treatment to amputation. However, because of the complexity of these combined procedures, we strongly urge careful patient selection. 
4	Popliteal artery aneurysms. Long-term follow-up of aneurysmal disease and results of surgical treatment. The natural history of aneurysmal disease was analyzed in 50 patients who were treated for 71 popliteal aneurysms. No patients were lost to follow-up (mean, 5.0 years). Initially, 25 popliteal aneurysms (25/71; 35%) were treated nonsurgically, and 46 (46/71; 65%) were treated surgically. Complications developed in 12 of the 21 asymptomatic popliteal aneurysms (57%) and in 2 of the 4 symptomatic popliteal aneurysms (50%), which were treated nonsurgically. The probability of developing complications increased with time to 74% within 5 years. When reconstruction of a popliteal aneurysm was performed, graft patency and foot salvage were 64% and 95% at 10 years, respectively. Particularly acute arterial thromboembolism was a severe presenting complication. Another important finding was the development of 23 arteriosclerotic aneurysms at other locations during follow-up in 16 patients (32%). The probability of developing these new aneurysms increased to 49% 10 years after repair of the initial popliteal aneurysm. The presence of multiple isolated aneurysms at the initial examination was the most significant risk factor limiting the survival of these patients. Consequently patients at risk could be identified early. This study confirms the limb-threatening potential of popliteal aneurysms when left untreated. Therefore prophylactic reconstructive surgery should be undertaken. Moreover, this study demonstrates that patients with a popliteal artery aneurysm have an increased risk of new aneurysm formation, both in the popliteal artery and at other locations. Therefore these patients should be followed and, in the event that new aneurysms develop, should be considered for elective reconstructive surgery to prevent limb-threatening or life-endangering complications. 
2	Diagnostic significance of carcinoembryonic antigen in the differential diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma. The histologic and cytologic distinction of malignant mesothelioma from carcinomas metastatic to the pleura or peritoneum is often problematic. For this reason immunologic methods are being increasingly used as diagnostic adjuncts. This review summarizes 40 studies on the expression of carcinoembryonic antigen in mesotheliomas and in lung and other carcinomas involving the pleura or peritoneum. Carcinoembryonic antigen was identified immunohistochemically in 11% of mesotheliomas and in 84% of carcinomas examined and immunocytochemically (in serous effusions) in 4% and 58%, respectively. In serum and in pleural or ascitic fluid, significantly elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen are commonly associated with (lung) carcinomas but rarely with mesotheliomas. Thus, together with identification of the antigen in serum, pleural fluid, or ascitic fluid, immunohistochemical and immunocytochemical techniques for detecting carcinoembryonic antigen provide a valuable aid for distinguishing malignant mesothelioma from metastatic carcinomas. 
5	Treatment of chronic moccasin-type tinea pedis with terbinafine: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Terbinafine is an orally and topically active fungicidal drug of the allylamine series. Its oral efficacy at 125 mg taken twice daily was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in moccasin-type tinea pedis. The study was conducted simultaneously in two centers and consisted of 41 evaluable cases (23 terbinafine, 18 placebo). Mycologic cure and near to complete clearing of signs and symptoms were obtained in 59% of the terbinafine-treated patients after 6 weeks of treatment and in 65% at 2 weeks after treatment. Corresponding efficacy for placebo-treated patients was zero at both evaluations. Side effects in both groups were minimal. We conclude that terbinafine is well tolerated and highly effective in moccasin-type tinea pedis. 
4	Inhibition of dipyridamole-induced ischemia by antianginal therapy in humans. Correlation with exercise electrocardiography. BACKGROUND. Dipyridamole echocardiography test (DET: two-dimensional echocardiographic monitoring with dipyridamole infusion up to 0.84 mg/kg in 10 minutes) is a useful tool for the noninvasive diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Aims of the present study were to assess the effects of antianginal drugs on dipyridamole-induced ischemia and to evaluate whether drug-induced changes in DET response may predict variations in exercise tolerance. METHODS AND RESULTS. Fifty-seven patients with angiographically assessed significant coronary artery disease (greater than 70% lumen reduction in at least one major coronary vessel) performed a DET and an exercise electrocardiography test (EET) in random order both off treatment and on antianginal drugs (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists and nitrates, alone or in various combinations). The criterion for DET positivity was a transient dyssynergy of contraction absent or of a lesser degree in the baseline examination. In DET, two parameters were evaluated: the dipyridamole time (i.e., the time from onset of dipyridamole infusion to obvious dyssynergy) and the wall motion score index. DET sensitivity was 91% off therapy and fell to 65% under therapy (p less than 0.01). In the 37 patients who had a positive DET both off and on therapy, the dipyridamole time increased from 6 +/- 3 (off therapy) to 8 +/- 3 minutes (on therapy) (p less than 0.01). The wall motion score index at peak dipyridamole went from 1.38 +/- 0.14 to 1.31 +/- 0.14 (p less than 0.01). EET and DET yielded concordant (positive versus negative) results in 41 of 57 (71%) patients off and in 35 of 57 (61%) on therapy (p = NS). In the subgroup of 38 patients with both positive DET and EET without treatment, the therapy-induced variations in exercise time were significantly correlated with the variations in dipyridamole time (r = 0.5; p less than 0.01), not with variations in wall motion score index (r = 0.3; p = NS). CONCLUSIONS. 1) Antianginal therapy can protect from dipyridamole-induced ischemia and 2) the therapy-induced changes in DET response parallel variations in exercise tolerance and might be useful for the objective, exercise-independent assessment of the therapy efficacy. 
5	Recovery profile after desflurane-nitrous oxide versus isoflurane-nitrous oxide in outpatients. Thirty-eight healthy outpatients undergoing elective surgical procedures lasting 1-3 h were randomly assigned to receive either desflurane 3% (approximately 0.5 MAC) or isoflurane 0.6% (approximately 0.5 MAC) for maintenance of general anesthesia with nitrous oxide 60% in oxygen after a standardized induction sequence consisting of fentanyl 3 micrograms.kg-1, thiopental 4 mg.kg-1, and succinylcholine 1-1.5 mg.kg-1, intravenously. Although anesthetic conditions were similar during operations in the two treatment groups, significant differences were noted in the recovery profiles as measured by elimination kinetics, psychometric testing, and visual analog scales (to assess subjective feelings). The time required for the end-tidal concentration to decrease by 50% was 2.5 +/- 0.8 min for desflurane vs. 9.5 +/- 3.4 min for isoflurane (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]). Times to awakening and ability to follow simple commands were significantly shorter after desflurane than after isoflurane (5.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 10.2 +/- 7.7 min 6.5 +/- 2.3 min vs. 11.1 +/- 7.9 min, respectively). Postoperatively, patients who received desflurane exhibited less impairment of cognitive function (as measured using the Digit-Symbol Substitution Test) than did those who received isoflurane. Furthermore, visual analog scores indicated that patients receiving desflurane experienced significantly less discomfort (pain), drowsiness, fatigue, clumsiness, and confusion in the early postoperative period. We conclude that desflurane may offer clinical advantages over isoflurane when used for maintenance of anesthesia during outpatient surgical procedures. 
5	Accelerated non-muscle contraction after subarachnoid hemorrhage: cerebrospinal fluid testing in a culture model. The cause of chronic cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage has been studied intensively, but it is still controversial whether the observable luminal narrowing should be attributed to the contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells or whether it results from some organic change in the wall. A proliferation of myointimal cells, accompanied by increased deposition of collagen, as well as myonecrosis, have been frequently observed several days after aneurysm rupture. Studies from our laboratory showed that these myointimal cells had characteristics identical to myofibroblasts. In this study, we quantitatively and morphologically examined the effect of cerebrospinal fluid on the ability of myofibroblasts to alter collagen matrices using an in vitro model. Myofibroblasts contract the collagen matrix by rearranging or compacting the framework of collagen fibers. Cerebrospinal fluid obtained from patients with recently ruptured aneurysms significantly accelerated lattice contraction, especially when the patient developed symptomatic vasospasm. This study suggests that myofibroblasts in the spastic artery can produce a contractile force that contributes to chronic vasospasm, tightening the proliferated collagen. Some unknown agent present in bloody cerebrospinal fluid accelerates the rearrangement of the collagen lattice by myofibroblasts, both of which have, until now, been considered non-contractile components. 
5	Quality assurance indicators and short-term outcome of hysterectomy. Fifteen gynecologic quality assurance indicators recently published by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were applied to a previously reported hysterectomy data base. Chart reviews were performed for the most recent 257 cases in the data base, representing an 18-month interval. The indicators were divided into two groups: those intended to identify morbidity and mortality and those intended to screen for appropriateness of care. Rates of actual morbidity and cases that failed to meet published criteria sets for hysterectomy were determined by chart review regardless of the presence of a quality assurance indicator. A total of 135 indicators were identified in 114 (44%) of the 257 cases, including 64 patients (25%) with morbidity indicators and 50 (19%) with appropriateness indicators. Actual morbidity was correctly identified in all 64 cases in which morbidity indicators were present. Three cases with significant morbidity were identified by chart review but not identified by the indicators, yielding positive and negative predictive values of 100 and 98%, respectively, and an overall accuracy of 99% for morbidity indicators. By contrast, 14 of the 50 cases in which appropriateness indicators were present actually failed to meet published criteria sets. An additional seven cases failing to meet criteria sets were identified by chart review and not identified by the indicators, yielding a positive predictive value of 28%, a negative predictive value of 97%, and an overall accuracy of 83% for appropriateness indicators. 
5	Blood contacts during surgical procedures Operating room personnel are at risk for infection with blood-borne pathogens through blood contact. To describe the nature and frequency of blood contact and its risk factors, trained observers monitored a sample of operations performed by six surgical services at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Ga, for 6 months. In 62 (30.1%) of 206 operations, at least one blood contact was observed. Of 1828 operating room person-procedures observed, 96 (5.3%) had 147 blood contacts (133 skin contacts [90%], 10 percutaneous injuries [7%], and four eye splashes [3%]). The mean number of blood contacts per 100 person-procedures was highest for surgeons (18.6). The frequency of percutaneous injury was similar among surgeons and scrub staff (mean, 1.2 per 100 worker-procedures for each group). Risk factors for surgeons' blood contacts were (1) performing a trauma, burn, or orthopedic emergency procedure (odds ratio [OR], 4.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.0 to 8.7); (2) patient blood loss exceeding 250mL (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 3.7); and (3) being in the operating room longer than 1 hour (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6 to 7.1). Of 110 blood contacts among surgeons, 81 (74%) were potentially preventable by additional barrier precautions, such as face shields and fluid-resistant gowns. Twenty-one (84%) of 25 blood contacts among surgeons in procedures in which all three risk factors were present were potentially preventable by additional barriers. Of 29 blood contacts among anesthesia and circulating personnel, 20 (69%) would have been prevented by glove use. For surgical procedures in which operating room personnel are at increased risk of blood contact, reevaluation of surgical technique, use of appropriate barrier precautions, and development of puncture-resistant glove materials are indicated. 
3	Tracheoesophageal anastomosis for intractable aspiration pneumonia. Permanent tracheostomy and tracheoesophageal anastomosis were performed as a means of surgical intervention for the treatment of intractable aspiration pneumonia. Conventional methods of tracheoesophageal anastomosis have entailed various problems. The improved method devised by us uses the special histological features and enables safe and reliable anastomosis. By this method, the tracheal perichondrium is retained and the strength of the anastomosed portion of the trachea is maintained, the failure of sutures due to tension on the anastomotic site being prevented. Also, reanastomosis can be performed after the cure of primary disease. 
3	Could Wallerian degeneration contribute to "leuko-araiosis" in subjects free of any vascular disorder? To determine the possible role of Wallerian degeneration secondary to the grey matter neuronal loss in the pathogenesis of "leuko-araiosis", computerised tomography (CT) of the brain was studied in 98 normotensive and non diabetic subjects free of cardiac diseases: 32 with Alzheimer's disease, 36 with Parkinson's disease, eight with progressive supranuclear palsy, and 22 controls. In Alzheimer's disease, leuko-araiosis scores were greater than in control subjects. Leuko-araiosis was more prominent in anterior periventricular areas in Parkinson's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, and in posterior periventricular areas in Alzheimer's disease. In two patients with Alzheimer's disease and leuko-araiosis, necropsy revealed diffuse white matter pallor, mild fibrillary astrocytosis, and in one patient limited hyaline thickening of small white matter vessels, without any infarction or hypertensive change. Changes were more severe in white matter close to cortical areas with a great density of neurofibrillary tangles. Leuko-araiosis was more severe or more widespread in Alzheimer's disease than in Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and normal ageing. Differences in the location of leuko-araiosis between the four groups might be due to differences in the location of the grey matter disorder and Wallerian degeneration rather than amyloid in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and normal ageing. Wallerian degeneration might be another cause of leuko-araiosis in neuro-degenerative disorders beside previously reported extra-cerebral predisposing factors and amyloid angiopathy. 
5	Hemodialysis-associated febrile episodes: surveillance before and after major alteration in the water treatment system. Surveillance for bacteremic or pyrogenic episodes associated with hemodialysis was undertaken before and after the reconstruction of the water treatment system at our University medical center. The new water system included a holding tank with iodination treatment. The water delivered to individual dialysis stations had only occasional positive bacterial cultures (3 of 21 samples before completion of construction, 2 of 16 samples afterwards) and intermittent detection of endotoxin (6 of 21 samples before completion of construction, 9 of 16 samples afterwards) at monthly sampling. Among 51 individual dialysis treatments (25 patients) before reconstruction and 56 treatments (29 patients), after, only 2 and 3 febrile events were identified, respectively. All of these were associated with underlying infectious illness and not with the hemodialysis procedure itself. Overall, we conclude that pyrogenic episodes associated directly with hemodialysis treatment are infrequent, and that the addition of a water storage tank with iodination treatment does not appear to increase the risk of bacteremia or pyrogenic episodes. 
4	Prognostic value of reduced heart rate variability after myocardial infarction: clinical evaluation of a new analysis method. The relation between heart rate variability, measured from standard 24 hour electrocardiogram recordings in patients convalescent after a myocardial infarction, and the occurrence of sudden death and spontaneous, symptomatic, sustained ventricular tachycardia were assessed in a consecutive series of 177 patients admitted with acute myocardial infarction and surviving to 7 days. In addition to the analysis of heart rate variability, the occurrence of non-sustained arrhythmias on 24 hour electrocardiographic monitoring, and the results of clinical assessment, signal averaged electrocardiography and ejection fraction were analysed and were related to outcome. During a median of 16 months of follow up (range 10-30 months) there were 17 end point events (11 (6.2%) sudden deaths) and six (3.4%) episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia. An index of the width of the frequency distribution curve for the duration of individual RR intervals was used to measure heart rate variability. This mean (SD) index was significantly smaller in those with end point events (16.8 (8.0)) than in those without events (29.0 (11.2)). The relative risk of the occurrence of an end point event in those with a heart rate variability index less than 25 was 7.0. Multivariate analysis showed that of all the variables examined a reduced heart rate variability index was the single most powerful predictor of end point events. Measurement of heart rate variability by this simple, automated, operator-independent method provided useful information on the arrhythmic propensity in patients convalescent after myocardial infarction. 
4	Ventricular tachycardia during routine treadmill testing. Risk and prognosis. Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing is considered to increase risk during testing. Moreover, exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia has been considered to confer a poor prognosis although this has not been specifically studied. On a retrospective review of 3351 patients who had undergone routine clinical exercise testing between September 1984 and June 1989, we identified 55 patients with exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia. The mean follow-up was 26 months (range, 2 to 58 months). Fifty patients had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing and one of these patients died due to congestive heart failure during the follow-up period. Five patients had sustained ventricular tachycardia during exercise testing and one died suddenly 7 months after the test. Ventricular tachycardia was reproduced in only two of the 29 patients who underwent repeated exercise testing. Ventricular tachycardia during routine clinical exercise testing occurred rarely (prevalence of 1.5%) and was not associated with complications during testing. The total mortality in the exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia group (3.6%) was not significantly different from the mortality in the entire population (5.1%). Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurring during clinical exercise testing is not an independent marker of a poor prognosis. 
4	Effects of prostaglandin E1 on collagen diseases with high levels of circulating immune complexes. Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) was administered to 4 patients with collagen diseases presenting with high levels of circulating immune complexes (CIC) in sera. Our study patients had progressive systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, and rheumatoid arthritis. In all 4 patients, CIC levels significantly decreased after administration of PGE1 by continuous infusion at 10/ng/kg/min via central venous catheter for 72 h. In addition, the skin ulcer in a patient with PSS healed completely, and the finger necrosis in a patient with RA improved. These results suggest that PGE1 given by continuous venous infusion is effective in reducing CIC, in addition to improving peripheral vascular disorders. 
4	Evolution of deep venous thrombosis: a prospective evaluation with US. Forty-six patients with a diagnosis of acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) established by means of duplex ultrasound (US) were prospectively followed up with serial duplex US examinations during a 6-month period to assess the persistence of venous abnormalities. All patients were asymptomatic. Isolated popliteal DVT was found to be more likely to revert to normal at duplex compression US than thrombosis involving both the femoral and popliteal systems (P less than .05). Increased venous diameter was a sign of acute clot (P less than .005). Clot echogenicity did not help to enable distinction of acute DVT and chronic DVT. At compression US, 10 of 21 patients (48%) who initially had occlusive thrombosis had persistent abnormalities that mimicked findings consistent with acute DVT. Chronic venous changes that persisted after 6 months consisted of either lumen recanalization (with resultant intimal thickening) or persistent venous occlusion. Both of these conditions can result in incomplete compression, the major US indication of acute DVT. This appearance should not be confused with that of acute DVT. Follow-up examinations to establish a baseline appearance can be obtained as early as 6 months after an acute episode of DVT. 
4	Secular trends in Q wave and non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction. The Minnesota Heart Survey. The Minnesota Heart Survey examined trends of Q wave and non-Q wave acute myocardial infarction (AMI) using a 50% random sample of all hospital discharges of patients with AMI or another acute coronary disease from 35 of 36 hospitals in 1970 and 30 of 31 hospitals in 1980 in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area. A total of 1,901 and 1,864 potential AMI cases were abstracted in 1970 and 1980, respectively. Electrocardiograms were coded according to the Minnesota code. AMIs were validated by computerized algorithm based on chest pain, enzymes, electrocardiograms, and autopsy. This study shows that with the use of a consistent, standard diagnostic algorithm, attack rates for Q wave AMI did not change significantly between 1970 and 1980 and that attack rates for non-Q wave AMI decreased significantly during the same decade. However, when the more sensitive cardiac enzymes creatine phosphokinase and creatine phosphokinase-MB were considered, attack rates of both Q wave and non-Q wave AMIs increased. This research documents four important trends for community AMI rates that are at variance with those reported by others. There was a decline in non-Q wave AMI attack rates from 1970 to 1980; women had outcomes equal to or worse than those for men for both case-fatality and 7-year survival rates; patients with non-Q wave AMIs had worse in-hospital prognoses than those with Q wave AMIs; and 7-year survival rates were worse for Q wave AMI in 1980. These findings demonstrate the need for standard diagnostic criteria for Q wave and non-Q wave AMI if trends are to be monitored. In the future, as new trials of operative and nonoperative therapies of AMI are undertaken, these considerations will increase in importance. 
5	Neutrophil influx into an inflammatory site inhibited by a soluble homing receptor-IgG chimaera. Neutrophil-mediated inflammation is involved in a number of human clinical manifestations, including the adult respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and reperfusion injury. One way of inhibiting this type of inflammatory response would be to block competitively the adhesive interactions between neutrophils and the endothelium adjacent to the inflamed region. The lectin-containing murine adhesion molecule gp90MEL, the homing receptor, is found on all leukocytic cells, including neutrophils. MEL 14, a monoclonal antibody directed against this adhesion molecule, blocks lymphocyte traffic to lymph nodes and extravasation of neutrophils from blood to inflammatory sites. Here we show that administration to mice of a soluble immunoglobulin chimaera containing the murine homing receptor extracellular domain significantly decreases the number of neutrophils that migrate to the peritoneum in response to the inflammatory irritant thioglycollate. These results indicate that soluble forms of a single type of adhesion molecule, the homing receptor, could be clinically effective compounds for the inhibition of neutrophil-mediated inflammation. 
1	Imaging of patients with stage D prostatic carcinoma. In conclusion, it would appear from present evidence that several statements can be made. First, MRI is the most accurate method of staging the periprostatic spread of carcinoma. Both the prostate and the regional nodes can be evaluated. The role of ultrasound is, at present, unclear. Second, the utility of CT has diminished with the emergence of high-quality MRI, but in situations in which MRI scans are inconclusive (e.g., in the assessment of paraaortic node disease, in which images are degraded by peristaltic movement), CT may be useful. Third, the choice of method for the assessment of nodal disease is a more difficult question. Although MRI and CT have replaced lymphography in most centers, the latter study, especially when combined with fine-needle aspiration biopsy, still is useful. Fourth, bone metastases are best assessed with scintigraphy, which can point to areas requiring supplemental plain radiography. An MRI study of the spine, although highly sensitive, is not practical. Fifth, MRI is superior to CT myelography in assessing spinal disease. Finally, the chest radiograph is the mainstay of assessing chest involvement. 
4	Amniotic and thromboembolism. Embolic phenomena in pregnancy demand rapid investigation and treatment. Regardless, some patients will not survive due to the enormity of the insult. Optimally, such patients should be treated in tertiary care centers, but this is not always possible. 
5	Genetic analysis as an aid in diagnosis for patients with midline carcinomas of uncertain histologies The tumors of nine patients with carcinomas of uncertain histogenesis (eight with poorly differentiated carcinomas involving primarily midline structures and one with a diagnosis of seminoma and atypical clinical features) were studied by cytogenetic and Southern blot analyses. Four of the eight patients with poorly differentiated carcinomas had abnormalities of chromosome 12 consistent with a diagnosis of germ cell tumor. These abnormalities comprised an i(12p) in two patients and a del(12q) in a third patient detected by cytogenetic analysis and multiple copies of 12p detected by Southern blot analysis in a fourth patient. Three of these four patients with a diagnosis of germ cell tumor established by genetic analysis achieved a complete response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The tumor biopsy of one patient showed a t(11;22) (q24;q12), and this patient had chemotherapy directed to neuroepithelioma. Cytogenetic analysis was unsuccessful for the tumors of three patients; these tumors did not have multiple copies of 12p detected by Southern blot analysis. These patients did not respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. One patient with a diagnosis of extragonadal seminoma failed to respond to cisplatin-based chemotherapy and had a second tumor biopsy performed that demonstrated a t(8;14) (q24;q32). This patient's diagnosis was changed to a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Thus, genetic analysis provided a diagnosis in six of nine patients. Cytogenetic and molecular analyses are useful clinical tools for the determination of histogenesis in some patients with poorly differentiated carcinomas of uncertain histology. 
1	The role of infection in the morbidity and mortality of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing multimodality therapy. Cancer of the head and neck is a common cancer worldwide. The majority of patients present with locally advanced disease. Recently a great deal of improvement has been made in multimodality therapy of this disease, warranting more careful consideration of factors affecting quality of life, disease course, and treatment. Infection is clearly a factor. Analysis of 662 hospital admissions of 169 head and neck cancer patients was performed. A definite infection was documented in 86 febrile episodes, pneumonia contributed to 40%, bacteremia to 13%, skin and soft tissue infection to 12%, and tracheobronchitis to 10%. Among the evaluated risk factors, foreign bodies, specifically intravenous (IV) cannulae and gastrostomy tubes, race, performance status, alcohol intake, and nutritional status were statistically significant variables that predicted for or were associated with infection. Infection contributed to 44% of the deaths. 
5	Methacholine challenges in the management of young children. Methacholine bronchial challenges (MBCs) have been used as an important diagnostic and management tool for physicians who treat children with chronic asthma. Despite this, children less than 5 years of age present significant diagnostic and management questions that can not easily be answered because of their inability to perform standard spirometry, and thus methacholine bronchial challenges. The present study was designed to evaluate with methacholine bronchial challenge small children (between 2 and 6 years of age) with the diagnosis of or a suspected diagnosis of asthma, utilizing a new method of evaluating airflow in small children through sound analysis, Computer Digitized Airway Phonopneumography (CDAP). There were 23 children in the study between the ages of 2 and 6 years with suspected asthma who could not perform pulmonary function tests. A control group consisting of 12 subjects between the ages of 8 and 38 years of age with a history of chronic cough and/or wheezing who could perform pulmonary function tests was also studied. Of the 12 patients over the age of 8 who had MBC, 11 of them had positive challenges with a fall in FEV1 of 19% or greater. The percent change in sound intensity levels from baseline range from 232% to 396% of baseline. There was greater than 200% change in mean intensity levels with a concentration of methacholine that produced a 19% fall in FEV1 in all of the eleven patients. For one individual who had a negative MBC there was only a 16% change in pulmonary function at 25 mg of methacholine with essentially no change in sound intensity level from baseline. 
5	Immunopathological response to loose cementless acetabular components. The membranes surrounding seven loose cementless acetabular implants were shown to contain polyethylene particles, birefringent in polarised light. Three of these implants were made of titanium alloy and the membranes around these contained titanium particles as well. There was no metallosis around the four implants made of chromium-cobalt-steel alloy. Both titanium and polyethylene particles caused migration, adherence and phagocytosis of CD11b-positive, peroxidase-negative macrophages. There were no histological signs of activation of the specific immune response; neither interleukin-2 receptor-positive activated T cells nor PCA-1 plasmablasts/plasma cells were present in the tissues. In cases of simple loosening, resident mesenchymal fibroblast-like cells were active. In aggressive granulomatosis, there were many macrophages and multinucleated giant cells but little fibroblast reaction. The clinical relevance of the findings is that the use of cementless prostheses is not a guarantee against adverse tissue reactions. 
1	Mandibular involvement in oral cancer. It is difficult to predict the tumour invasion into the mandible by oral cancer pre-operatively, and consequently the decision to preserve or sacrifice the mandible is largely individualistic. The present study of 44 cases analyses the reliability of pre-operative parameters to assess mandibular involvement. Clinical, radiological and scintigraphic features have been compared with the detailed histology of the bone. This study confirms the usefulness of superior marginal resections in lesions which are close to but not involving the mandible, as well as for superficial lesions which are actually seen to involve the mandible but their CT and bone scans are negative for tumour invasion. 
5	Emphysematous pyelonephritis: surgical implications. Emphysematous pyelonephritis in patients with diabetes mellitus is increasingly recognised as a disease requiring urgent and aggressive treatment. We present 3 cases of emphysematous pyelonephritis; 1 patient required percutaneous nephrostomy followed by nephroureterectomy but the other 2 were successfully managed with antibiotics and control of diabetes. Diagnosis was confirmed by sequential imaging techniques which demonstrated an inflammatory renal mass associated with gas and fluid. 
4	Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome terminating as disseminated T-cell lymphoma. The authors describe a case of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) terminated as a T-cell lymphoma in a 3-year-old girl. The clinical course was chronic and characterized by chronic eczema, persistent peripheral blood eosinophilia, organomegaly, interstitial lung change, and pericarditis. Postmortem examination demonstrated a disseminated T-cell lymphoma involving the inguinal lymph node, liver, lung, and kidney. The findings of the current case suggest a possibility that certain abnormalities in this case of idiopathic HES per se may have triggered the development of malignant lymphoma, and it may represent a transition of idiopathic HES into a T-cell lymphoma. Other possible sequences are discussed. The development of T-cell malignancy in idiopathic HES in a girl is quite an unusual presentation. 
5	Pseudo-abscess of the psoas bursa in failed double-cup arthroplasty of the hip. Seven psoas bursae filled with purulent fluid and inspissated debris were revealed at revision operations for failed resurfacing hip arthroplasties, an incidence of 5.8% in such revisions. Histological and microbiological investigations demonstrated that the psoas bursa collections resulted from the tissue response to polyethylene wear debris. None was due to infection. 
1	Clinical stage 1 testicular cancer: the role of modified retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. A total of 85 patients underwent modified retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy for clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis from 1982 to 1989. The technique was a modified bilateral dissection via a thoracoabdominal approach. A full bilateral dissection was done above the level of the inferior mesenteric artery but unilateral dissection was performed below the inferior mesenteric artery using a template method. Of the 85 patients 64 had pathological stage A and 21 had stage B1 disease. Relapses have occurred in 4 of 64 stage A cancer patients (6%) and 3 of 21 stage B1 cancer patients (15%). Antegrade ejaculation was preserved without pharmacological therapy in 75 of 85 patients (88%) and 5 others were converted to antegrade ejaculation with imipramine. Therefore, 80 of 85 patients (94%) have recovered antegrade ejaculation. With a median followup of 38 months 7 relapses have been noted. We conclude that modified retroperitoneal lymph node dissection allows for preservation of ejaculation, decreases concern about retroperitoneal understaging and represents the preferred alternative to surveillance protocols for patients with low stage testicular cancer. 
5	Immediate and follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of postoperative recoarctation in infants and children. The purpose of this article is to present immediate and follow-up results of balloon angioplasty of aortic recoarctations following previous surgery in infants and children. During a 45-month period that ended in June 1989, nine infants and children, ages 6 months to 7 years, underwent balloon angioplasty of recoarctation with resultant reduction in peak-to-peak systolic pressure gradient from 52 +/- 20 mm Hg (mean +/- SD) to 16 +/- 8 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) and increase in coarctation segment size from 3.4 +/- 1.4 mm to 6.1 +/- 1.6 mm (p less than 0.01). None required surgical intervention. There were no significant complications. Follow-up catheterization (16 +/- 7 months) data in six children and follow-up clinical (17 +/- 6 months) data in all children were available for review. Both the residual coarctation pressure gradient (6 +/- 6 mm Hg) and coarctation segment size (8.2 +/- 2.4 mm) remain improved (p less than 0.001) when compared with pre-balloon angioplasty values and the pressure gradient fell further (p less than 0.01) when compared with that measured immediately after balloon angioplasty. None developed restenosis, although one child required surgical relief of severe narrowing of isthmus of the aortic arch. None developed aneurysms. On the basis of this experience and that reported in the literature and because of high morbidity and mortality rates associated with repeat surgery for postoperative recoarctation, we recommend balloon angioplasty as the procedure of choice for relief of postoperative recoarctation with significant hypertension. 
2	Inflammatory bowel disease and tobacco smoke--a case-control study. A case-control study was carried out in Stockholm, Sweden between 1984 and 1987 to evaluate the association of cigarette smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood and the subsequent development of inflammatory bowel disease. Information on smoking was obtained by a postal questionnaire. The relative risk of Crohn's disease in current smokers compared with those who had never smoked was 1.33 (95% confidence limits 0.7; 2.6) in men and 4.99 (2.7; 9.2) in women; the corresponding results for ulcerative colitis were 0.96 (0.5; 1.8) and 0.72 (0.4; 1.4). The relative risk of ulcerative colitis in recent exsmokers compared with those who had never smoked was 2.18 (0.9; 5.0). Furthermore, an increase in the risk of Crohn's disease was found in those who were exposed to environmental tobacco smoke during childhood, the relative risk being 1.50 (1.0; 2.3). The corresponding relative risk of ulcerative colitis was 0.98 (0.6; 1.5). 
1	Actin architecture of cultured human thyroid cancer cells: predictor of differentiation? The actin cytoskeleton is important for cell structure and motility. A disordered actin architecture has been correlated with a high metastatic potential in melanoma, fibrosarcoma, and colon cancer models. Thyrotropin is known to induce growth and differentiation in cultured thyroid cells, whereas the carcinogenic phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) causes dedifferentiation and malignant transformation in many cell lines. We therefore assessed the effect of thyrotropin and TPA on the actin architecture of FTC-133 human follicular thyroid cancer cells in continuous culture. Staining of filamentous actin with rhodamine phalloidin showed that 1 mU/ml or 30 mU/ml thyrotropin-induced actin polymerization was detectable at 1 hour but more notable at 24 hours. Similarly TPA (0.008 to 10 mumol/L) caused rapid actin fiber disruption and redistribution to the cell periphery. Secondary antibody staining for alpha-actinin, a protein that binds and crosslinks actin, was more prominent after treatment with thyrotropin but decreased after TPA. These findings indicate that the actin cytoskeleton has a dynamic response to trophic factors. Thyrotropin promoted actin polymerization, but TPA caused depolymerization. These effects may correlate with cellular alpha-actinin levels. Actin architecture may therefore reflect the state of differentiation of thyroid tumor cells. 
5	The influence of age vs peak serum concentration on life-threatening events after chronic theophylline intoxication. To identify risk factors for the development of seizures and cardiac arrhythmias after chronic, unintentional theophylline intoxication we monitored the clinical course of 72 consecutive patients referred to a regional poison center with chronic theophylline intoxication (serum theophylline concentration, greater than or equal to 167 mumol/L after protracted use). The median age of the sample was 47.5 years (range, 4 days to 91 years). Median peak theophylline concentration was 239 mumol/L, with a range of 167 to 722 mumol/L. A life-threatening event (LTE) occurred in 28 patients (39%) that included seizures in eight and a major cardiac arrhythmia in 22. The median peak (theophylline) of patients who had an LTE vs those who did not was 235.8 vs 238.7 mumol/L. However, the median age of patients with an LTE compared with those without an LTE was significantly greater (70.5 vs 18.0 years). Stratification of data by chronologic age revealed a stepwise increase in the frequency of LTE with advancing years: patients more than 75 years old had a 16.7-fold greater risk of LTE than patients less than 25 years old (95% confidence interval, 3.56, 77.5) despite comparable intergroup median serum (theophylline). These data suggest the primary determinant of LTEs after chronic theophylline intoxication is chronologic age. Elderly patients have an inordinately greater risk of LTE than younger patients. Peak serum theophylline concentration cannot predict which patients with chronic theophylline intoxication will have an LTE. Finally, these data indicate that theophylline should be used cautiously and with frequent monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in elderly patients. 
3	A pilot study of suramin in the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Suramin sodium is an aromatic polysulfonated compound that was originally introduced as an antiparasitic agent in the 1920s. Recently, in view of its ability to bind and disrupt the function of multiple growth factors and cellular enzyme systems, the authors have been evaluating the role of suramin as an antitumor agent. In this study, 12 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma received parenteral suramin by continuous infusion to a peak plasma suramin level greater than 200 micrograms/ml. No objective radiographic responses were observed, although greater than 90% necrosis of multiple tumor sites was documented at autopsy in one patient and normalization of tumor-related hypercalcemia occurred in another patient. Two patients had stable disease of 10 and 28 weeks' duration, respectively. Significant toxicities included hypotension related to sepsis and resulting in renal insufficiency (one patient), development of liver function abnormalities (one patient) marked thrombocytopenia (one patient), prothrombin time prolongation (all patients), vortex keratopathy (two patients), and Grade 1 sensory neuropathy (two patients). On the basis of the current results, suramin does not appear to be an active single agent against metastatic renal cell carcinoma when administered by this dosing schedule. 
1	Intraventricular diamorphine via an Ommaya shunt for intractable cancer pain. We describe two patients in whom diamorphine was administered into the intraventricular space via an Ommaya reservoir, producing excellent pain relief. The use of this technique for long term administration of analgesia is reviewed. 
1	Translocation (9;22) is associated with extremely poor prognosis in intensively treated children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The prognostic implications of t(9;22)(q34;q11) were assessed at a median follow-up of 3.5 years in 434 children receiving intensive treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Four-year event-free and overall survivals were 81% and 88%, respectively, in 419 children lacking t(9;22), but were 0% and 20%, respectively, in 15 children with t(9;22) (P less than .001). Poor outcome for children with t(9;22)-positive ALL was particularly notable because we have reported improved survival in other historically poor prognosis ALL cytogenetic categories when treated with similarly intensive therapy. We recommend that very intensive treatment approaches, including bone marrow transplantation in first remission, be considered for all children with t(9;22)-positive ALL. 
2	Crohn's disease of the lung Two years after developing colonic Crohn's disease, a 17 year old boy presented with focal pulmonary consolidation. A lung biopsy specimen showed areas of non-caseating epithelioid granuloma. Although some respiratory abnormalities appear to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, granulomatous disease affecting the lung has not previously been reported in a child. 
5	Intrathoracic Nissen fundoplication: long-term clinical and pH-monitoring evaluation. From 1976 until April 1989, 31 intrathoracic total fundoplications were performed for reflux esophagitis and irreducible hiatus hernia. In the first 16 patients (group 1) the operation was complicated with acute perforation of the wrap in 4 cases, bronchogastric fistula in 1, and herniation of the wrap higher in the chest in 1. Technical modifications were applied to 15 more recent patients (group 2). These are enlargement of the hiatus, looseness of the wrap and its appropriate anchorage, avoidance of forceps when handling the stomach, care with the vagi, and efficient gastric decompression in the postoperative period. The postoperative course was always uneventful in group 2. Twenty-six patients, who still have their initial wrap, were considered for clinical evaluation: 11 from group 1 (mean follow-up, 81.5 months) and 15 from group 2 (mean follow-up, 32.8 months). All are free from any symptom of reflux; gas-bloat syndrome is infrequent and dysphagia is relieved. Twenty-four-hour pH monitoring, performed in 14 patients (3 from group 1 and 11 from group 2) (mean follow-up, 42 months), was normal in 13; a pathological upright reflux (time pH less than 4, 8.4%) was demonstrated in one symptom-free woman in whom endoscopy was unremarkable. Mechanisms of complications experienced in group 1 are analyzed in the light of the technical evolution of the procedure, and the place of the intrathoracic total fundoplication in the management of short esophagus is defined, considering the other available surgical techniques. 
4	Current results of elective aortic reconstruction for aneurysmal and occlusive disease. Decisions to resect small aortic aneurysms or employ non-operative treatment for aorto-iliac occlusive disease must depend on current rather than historical surgical results. To assess current morbidity and mortality, we reviewed 200 consecutive aortic resections in two groups of patients treated from 1981 to 1989: those undergoing elective aortofemoral bypass for occlusive disease (AFB, no. 100) or resection of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA, no. 100). Indications for AFB included claudication (54%), rest pain (32%), and gangrene (13%). AAA size ranged from 3 to 14 cm (mean 6.5 +/- 2.4 cm); 45% presented with abdominal or back pain. Patients undergoing AFB were younger (AFB 61.5 +/- 10 years vs AAA 68.7 +/- 8.9 years) with a higher incidence of some atherosclerotic risk factors, diabetes mellitus 30% vs 10%, tobacco use 77% vs 49%, hyperlipidemia 21% vs 7%; p less than 0.001). Coronary artery disease (CAD) was more prevalent in AAA patients (49% vs 34%; p less than 0.001). Postoperative mortality was not different in occlusive or aneurysmal disease (3% AFB vs 2% AAA), nor was the occurrence of serious complications such as myocardial infarction (2% vs 1%) or pulmonary embolism (2% vs 3%). Improvements in patient selection, perioperative care and surgical technique have lowered the mortality of elective aortic surgery. Given the current standard of care, an aggressive approach to AAA even in high risk patients is appropriate. The low morbidity of AFB for occlusive disease mandates a critical appraisal of less effective nonoperative therapies. 
5	Ptychotropism as a cutaneous feature of the CHILD syndrome. The hallmark of the CHILD syndrome is a unilateral ichthyosiform nevus that displays a pronounced affinity for the body folds. For this phenomenon the term ptychotropism is proposed. The expression is composed from the Greek words ptyche (fold) and trope (a turning). It is concluded that the cutaneous lesions of the CHILD nevus are determined by two factors, lyonization and ptychotropism. The phenomenon of ptychotropism constitutes an additional argument to distinguish the CHILD nevus from the inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus because the latter is not ptychotropic. 
5	Very low birth weight children: behavior problems and school difficulty in a national sample We addressed three questions concerning the behavioral and academic status of low and very low birth weight infants through a secondary analysis of the 1981 National Health Interview Survey--Child Health Supplement: (1) in children born with very low birth weight, what is the risk of behavior problems and school difficulty compared with that in heavier low birth weight and normal birth weight children? (2) What are the correlates of school difficulty? (3) Are behavior problems associated with school difficulty when variables are controlled for these correlates? The analysis revealed that 34% of very low birth weight children could be characterized as having school difficulty, compared with 20% and 14% of the other groups, respectively, and that they were more likely to have higher scores on the hyperactive subscale of the Behavior Problems Index. Although a broad array of sociodemographic factors correlated with school difficulty, very low birth weight and hyperactivity scores contributed independently to the risk of academic problems. We conclude that very low birth weight infants are at risk of having school problems that are in part associated with hyperactive behavior. 
1	Results of surgical treatment of kidney cancer with solitary metastasis to contralateral adrenal. A large series of patients were reviewed in two major teaching institutions, and patients with a carcinoma of the kidney with a solitary metastatic deposit in the contralateral adrenal were identified. Their survival was analyzed and compared with the survival of those patients having a solitary metastatic deposit in other organs. 
1	Queuine, a tRNA anticodon wobble base, maintains the proliferative and pluripotent potential of HL-60 cells in the presence of the differentiating agent 6-thioguanine. 6-Thioguanine (6-TG)-induced differentiation of hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (IMP: pyrophosphate phosphoribosyltransferase, EC 2.4.2.8)-deficient HL-60 cells is characterized by 2 days of growth, after which morphological differentiation proceeds. Addition of the tRNA wobble base queuine, in the presence of 6-TG, maintains the proliferative capability of the cells. The ability of 6-TG to induce differentiation correlates with c-myc mRNA down-regulation, but queuine has no effect on this parameter. Treatment with 6-TG for 2-3 days commits HL-60 cells to granulocytic differentiation, and, once committed, these cells do not respond to the monocytic inducer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Nonetheless, when cells are treated with queuine and 6-TG, they maintain the promyelocytic morphology and are capable of being induced down the monocytic pathway by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as indicated by stabilization of c-fms mRNA and cell adherence. In the absence of queuine, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is incapable of inducing monocytic markers in the 6-TG-treated cells. The data presented indicate that 6-TG-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells is a tRNA-facilitated event and that the tRNA wobble base queuine is capable of maintaining both the proliferative and pluripotent potential of the cells. 
2	Vasopressin-related bullous disease of the legs. We report a 33-year-old man who developed cutaneous necrosis of the lower extremities with extensive bulla formation after i.v. administration of vasopressin for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices. Due to its potent nonselective vasoconstrictive action, vasopressin not only may induce cardiac and gastrointestinal ischemia, but cutaneous ischemia as well. As in our patient, this may lead to extensive necrotic skin lesions at sites distant from the infusion. 
5	The relationship of intraluminal shunting to technical results after carotid endarterectomy. This study evaluates the incidence of defects on the intraoperative angiograms of 160 carotid endarterectomies performed in 146 patients, 81 of 160 (50.6%) with a shunt and 79 of 160 operations (49.4%) performed without a shunt. Angiographic defects were identified in 34 of 160 carotid endarterectomies (21%), of which 21 of 34 (65%) resulted in a greater than 20% stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). There were defects in 6 of 81 (7.4%) shunted vessels compared to 16 of 79 (20%) of those not shunted (p less than 0.05). Thirty-one vessels were reexplored 11 of 81 (13.5%) of those shunted and 20 of 79 (20%) of those not shunted (p less than 0.05). There were four strokes (2.5%) (2 in each group) and one death due to myocardial infarction (0.6%) in the postoperative period. Duplex follow-up from 1-60 months (median 22 months) was available in 114 of 160 (71%) endarterectomies. A stenosis of greater than 50% was detected in 7 of 114 (6%) carotid arteries; 5 of the 7 (71%) were shunted and 2 (29%) were nonshunted. Unrepaired defects were present in 3 of 7 (43%) and no defects in the remaining 4 of 7 (57%) arteries. We conclude that the use of a shunt significantly decreases the number of ICA defects detected angiographically and that immediate revision of demonstrable defects can be undertaken with low morbidity and does not predispose the patient to recurrent stenosis. 
2	Endoscopy in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection. Two cases of mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) infection in association with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are presented to highlight the distinctive upper gastrointestinal endoscopic appearances: 2 X 4 mm diameter, white nodules with intervening erythema and hemorrhagic erosions covered the mucosa of the second part of the duodenum. Histological evaluation of these nodules revealed diffuse expansion of the lamina propria by macrophages that contained numerous intracellular and extracellular acid-fast organisms. We conclude that endoscopy with endoscopic biopsy may represent the most rapid and sensitive diagnostic tool available in this disease. 
2	Portacaval shunt as an experimental model of impaired hepatic release of vitamin A in liver disease. Vitamin A concentrations in serum and liver were studied in rats with a portacaval shunt for 48 days after shunt surgery. In addition, serum and tissue concentrations of zinc were analyzed. Following portacaval shunting serum vitamin A concentration decreased to 25% of the level in sham-operated controls, whereas serum zinc concentration decreased to 80%. The mean urinary excretion rate of zinc increased in shunted rats [18.7 +/- 2.1 micrograms/day (0.28 +/- 0.03 mumol/day)] compared with controls [13.8 +/- 1.7 micrograms/day (0.21 +/- 0.03 mumol/day)] (P less than 0.01). The concentration of retinol and total retinoids in liver tissue increased 2-3-fold in rats with a portacaval shunt, and the ratio of retinol to retinoids was slightly increased. The differences were reduced when the total organ content was calculated, because of the reduced liver weight in the shunted rats. The concentration of zinc in liver tissue decreased in rats with portacaval shunts [30.8 +/- 4.9 micrograms/g wet wt (0.47 +/- 0.07 mumol/g) vs. 35.6 +/- 3.7 micrograms/g wet wt (0.54 +/- 0.06 mumol/g) in controls; P less than 0.01]. The concentration of zinc was inversely correlated with retinol (r = -0.52, P less than 0.05) and total retinoid levels (r = -0.70, P less than 0.05) in rats with portacaval shunts but not in controls. The data are consistent with the hypothesis of an impaired release of vitamin A from the liver in rats with portacaval shunts, an impairment that could be due to liver zinc deficiency. 
4	Role of cytochrome P-450 in reperfusion injury of the rabbit lung. Reactive oxygen species are a major cause of damage occurring in ischemic tissue after reperfusion. During reperfusion transitional metals such as iron are required for reactive oxygen species to mediate their major toxic effects. Xanthine oxidase is an important source of reactive oxygen species during ischemia-reperfusion injury, but not in all organs or species. Because cytochrome P-450 enzymes are an important pulmonary source of superoxide anion (O2-.) generation under basal conditions and during hyperoxia, and provide iron catalysts necessary for hydroxyl radical (.OH) formation and propagation of lipid peroxidation, we postulated that cytochrome P-450 might have a potential role in mediating ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this report, we explored the role of cytochrome P-450 enzymes in a rabbit model of reperfusion lung injury. The P-450 inhibitors 8-methoxypsoralen, piperonyl butoxide, and cimetidine markedly decreased lung edema from transvascular fluid flux. Cimetidine prevented the reperfusion-related increase in lung microvascular permeability, as measured by movement of 125I-albumin from the vascular space into lung water and alveolar fluid. P-450 inhibitors also prevented the increase in lung tissue levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive products in the model. P-450 inhibitors did not block enhanced O2-. generation by ischemic reperfused lungs, measured by in vivo reduction of succinylated ferricytochrome c in lung perfusate, but did prevent the increase in non-protein-bound low molecular weight chelates of iron after reperfusion. Thus, cytochrome P-450 enzymes are not likely a major source of enhanced O2-. generation, but serve as an important source of iron in mediating oxidant injury to the rabbit lung during reperfusion. These results suggest an important role of cytochrome P-450 in reperfusion injury to the lung and suggest potential new therapies for the disorder. 
3	Depression in dementia of the Alzheimer type and in multi-infarct dementia. The authors used the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and a rating of depressed mood to investigate the prevalence of depression in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease, 37 patients with multi-infarct dementia, and 30 nondemented comparison subjects. The prevalence of depressed mood depended on the severity of dementia as measured by the Mini-Mental State examination and was significantly lower among patients in more severe stages of Alzheimer's disease but not among patients with severe multi-infarct dementia. 
5	Chronic blood hyperviscosity in subjects with acute stroke, transient ischemic attack, and risk factors for stroke. The origin and significance of blood hyperviscosity in subjects with acute stroke has been controversial. It has been argued that viscous abnormalities simply reflect either elevated hematocrit or an acute-phase response to the stroke itself. To address these issues, we measured the factors that determine blood viscosity in a cross-sectional study of 430 subjects, including 135 with acute stroke, 89 with acute transient ischemic attacks of the brain, 115 with recognized risk factors for stroke, and 91 healthy controls. The at-risk group was balanced with the acute stroke group for types of risk factors and medication usage, and all four groups were balanced for age. The viscosity of whole blood at low rates of shear and the plasma viscosity were significantly elevated in both groups with cerebrovascular symptoms and in the at-risk group compared with the healthy controls. The severity of hyperviscosity was stroke group greater than transient ischemic attack group greater than at-risk group greater than healthy controls. Increased viscosity of whole blood was associated with an elevated plasma fibrinogen concentration and with a decreased albumin/globulin ratio. This study provides evidence that blood hyperviscosity is present not only in subjects with acute brain infarction, but also in those with risk factors for stroke, and that these abnormalities are, to a considerable degree, chronic. 
5	Fourth branchial pouch anomaly. We present an extremely rare case of fourth branchial fistula in a 23-year-old male. The characteristic clinical feature was a recurrent left lower neck abscess which did not respond to appropriate medical and surgical therapy. Radiography and a computed tomographic scan with contrast material revealed a fistula running from the apex of the left pyriform sinus (internal opening) to the left lower neck abscess. The fistula tract was excised surgically. Histological examination of the excised fistula revealed a squamous epithelial lining and subepithelial lymphoid tissue. This pyriform sinus fistula is thought to be of fourth pharyngeal pouch origin, because of its surgical aspects and the histological findings of the excised fistula. 
3	Botulinum toxin therapy. Botulinum toxin therapy has emerged as a treatment modality for a variety of spastic- or contracture-related muscle diseases. Its safety has been proven for long-term use in the treatment of benign essential blepharospasm, hemifacial spasm, and certain types of strabismus. Recent approval from the Federal Drug Administration should make botulinum toxin available for use in a greater number of patients. 
1	Thermography as a predictor of prognosis in cancer of the breast. Although thermography is generally considered to lack sufficient sensitivity to be a useful in diagnosis of cancer of the breast, the association of a thermal abnormality with some breast cancers cannot be discounted. Breast cancers demonstrating such a thermographic abnormality have been reported to be associated with decreased survival when compared with patients with no such change. In a study of 214 patients confirmed to have breast cancer without distant metastases, 121 were found to have a thermographic abnormality. Patients whose tumors were thermographically abnormal had significantly larger primary lesions and a higher proportion of metastatic axillary lymph nodes. However, both the 5-year survival and the 5-year disease-free survival were not significantly different from patients who had no thermographic abnormality. 
5	Endophthalmitis after removal of an encircling band. A case of endophthalmitis following the removal of an encircling band is presented. A possible route of entry in the absence of scleral perforation during the procedure is proposed.
