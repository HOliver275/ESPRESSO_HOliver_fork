3	Late effects of paralytic poliomyelitis in Olmsted County, Minnesota. We identified a cohort of 300 individuals who had paralytic polio between 1935 and 1955. All lived in Olmsted County, Minnesota. From the 247 survivors, we selected 50 subjects for detailed historical, functional, psychological, clinical, and electrophysiologic evaluation. Sixty-four percent of these 50 survivors complained of new symptoms of muscle pain, fatigue, and weakness after a period of prolonged stability. This led to changes in lifestyle or activity in only 18%. The likelihood of expressing new complaints was not related to present age or interval since polio, and electrophysiologic testing did not distinguish between those with or without new problems. The development of new difficulties in a limb was most strongly predicted by significant paralysis of that limb at the time of the acute illness. Patients with leg weakness were twice as likely to complain of new problems compared to those with arm weakness. Elevated creatine kinase levels were present only in those with new complaints. 
1	Bladder cancer. Human leukocyte antigen II, interleukin-6, and interleukin-6 receptor expression determined by the polymerase chain reaction. The prediction of tumour biology rarely rests upon a single characteristic of the malignancy. The analysis of a single gene can complement standard histologic evaluation. The investigation of new parameters as well as the routine clinical analysis of gene expression is often limited because of the small amount of tissue available. This is particularly true of de novo human bladder cancers because they are generally small or handled in such a way as to hinder the analysis of multiple different parameters. Analysis of expressed mRNA by the polymerase chain reaction (RNA/PCR) is a method that allows the development of a profile of bladder cancer gene expression. The authors report the use of the RNA/PCR method to examine in bladder cancer the expression of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II gene family (HLA-DR, DQ, and DP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R). All de novo transitional cell carcinomas, one squamous carcinoma, and two transitional cell carcinoma cell lines expressed the majority of HLA class II genes. All samples expressed IL-6R RNA whereas production of IL-6 message was limited to one of the cell lines and to the high-grade bladder cancers. These results were combined with stage, grade, and DNA content to develop a profile of the cancers examined. Although an improved predictive index based on gene expression analysis by RNA/PCR has not been realized, a broader survey of human tumors for expression of these genes and others is likely to refine the classification of bladder cancer. 
4	Cardiac disease in the alcoholic patient. Ethanol in acute low doses is believed to be relatively nontoxic to the normal myocardium, despite data indicating low-level contractility impairment. In patients with myocardial disease, or as the serum ethanol concentration is increased to high levels, angina, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmia may be potentiated. Chronic ethanol use, at moderate doses, may be protective against coronary artery disease, despite increased rates of hypertension. Alcohol consumption at high doses may result in dilated cardiomyopathy and a dismal prognosis. Alcohol abuse is associated with increased mortality. 
5	Primary peritoneal sarcoidosis. A 14-year-old male was admitted for the evaluation of tense exudative ascites. Despite thorough evaluation, the diagnosis remained cryptic until peritoneoscopy revealed diffuse studding of the entire visualized peritoneum with multiple miliary nodules, and peritoneal biopsy demonstrated multiple noncaseating epithelioid granulomas. After other causes were excluded, a diagnosis of sarcoidosis was considered and confirmed with classic endobronchial findings at bronchoscopy. Involvement of the peritoneum with sarcoidosis is rare and, to our knowledge, only one other case describes this as the initial manifestation of this disease. 
3	Reversible nerve conduction block in patients with polyneuropathy after ultrasound thermotherapy at therapeutic dosage. This study investigated the effect of ultrasound on nerve conduction in patients with polyneuropathy. Eight able-bodied controls (Group C) and 16 patients with clinical and physiologic evidence of polyneuropathy were tested. Eight patients (Group NP) had no aching pain symptoms; eight patients (Group P) had severe aching pain, burning sensation, unpleasant tingling, and/or hyperesthesia in the lower extremities. For two minutes, therapeutic ultrasound in doses of 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5W/cm2 were applied over the anterior surface of the leg along the pathway of the deep peroneal nerve. Peroneal nerve conduction studies were performed before, during, and after ultrasound treatment. The compound muscle action potential (CMAP) was recorded from the extensor digitorum brevis muscle. Nerve conduction studies on all eight patients in Group P revealed a significant decrease (41.4% and 44% reduced for doses of 1.0W/cm2 and 1.5W/cm2, respectively; p less than .05) in amplitude of CMAP (from baseline to the first negative peak), and an increase (6.4% and 6.7% increased for doses of 1.0W/cm2 and 1.5W/cm2, respectively; p less than .05) in proximal latency one minute after ultrasound application with a dose of 1.0 or 1.5W/cm2, but not with a dose of 0.5W/cm2 (p greater than 0.1). Changes returned to pretreatment values within five minutes of cessation of ultrasound therapy. In Groups C and NP, there were no significant changes in amplitudes of CMAP or proximal latency before, during, or after ultrasound therapy at a dose of 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5W/cm2. It was concluded that ultrasonic therapy with therapeutic dosage may cause a reversible conduction block on patients with painful polyneuropathy. 
5	Limitations of faecal chymotrypsin as a screening test for chronic pancreatitis. Faecal chymotrypsin was measured in patients with chronic pancreatitis and in healthy black urban and rural control subjects. In the patients, significantly lower values of faecal chymotrypsin were obtained (mean (SD) 2.4 1.79 U/g stool) whereas in urban control subjects, values were within the normal range (mean (SD) 13.2 (11.9)). In rural black control subjects, however, the faecal chymotrypsin value was significantly lower (mean (SD) 7.1 (5.1)) than in urban black control subjects. It is suggested that faecal pH may influence faecal chymotrypsin values. The mean faecal pH in rural black subjects (pH 6.14) was significantly lower than that in urban control subjects (pH 6.77) and in patients with chronic pancreatitis (pH 6.61). Moreover, mean faecal chymotrypsin is high (20.0 U/g stool) at a pH greater than 7. Between pH 6 and 7 the mean value drops to 8.6 U/g stool and below pH 6 mean faecal chymotrypsin is in the abnormal range (4.4 U/g stool). Hence, low values for faecal chymotrypsin may be due to lower faecal pH (less than 6) in healthy control subjects. For diagnostic purposes, the faecal pH value should be determined if a low faecal chymotrypsin value is obtained. 
5	Levels of serum granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in patients with infections. To clarify the physiologic roles of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in infectious states in vivo, we examined the serum levels of G-CSF in patients with infection. Serum samples from 24 patients in the acute stage of infection (14 men and 10 women, age 65 to 101, without hematologic disorders), as well as samples from 32 age-matched normal elderly volunteers were investigated. Sixteen of the initial 24 patients were reexamined after the recovery phase. G-CSF levels were examined by quantitative enzyme immunoassay. The G-CSF level in normal elderly controls, 25.3 +/- 19.7 pg/mL, was not different from that reported in other findings. There was no statistically significant relationship between their G-CSF level and peripheral white blood cell count or neutrophilic granulocyte count. The G-CSF level in the acute stage of infection was 731.8 +/- 895.0 pg/mL, with a range of 30 to 3,199 pg/mL. There was no significant difference in G-CSF levels between patients with respiratory tract infection and those with urinary tract infection. In all 16 cases examined, the serum G-CSF level in the acute stage of infection was significantly higher than that after recovery phase, the latter being the same as the level in normal elderly controls. G-CSF must therefore play a significant role in human infectious states in vivo. 
4	Collateral circulation in Kawasaki disease with coronary occlusion or severe stenosis. Forty patients with Kawasaki disease with severe coronary sequelae were investigated. All had at least a 90% reduction in the diameter of the major coronary artery. Collateral vessels were seen in 32 of 33 (97%) patients with total occlusion. All patients with severe stenosis but not total occlusion had no or poorly developed collateral vessels. Analysis according to the presence or absence of collateral vessels showed no significant differences in the results of treadmill stress testing and myocardial imaging between these two groups. In patients treated surgically, the abnormalities recognized by these tests were normalized or improved when the bypass was patent. These data indicate that collateral circulation in patients with Kawasaki disease cannot be seen angiographically unless there is total occlusion and the presence of collateral circulation cannot provide protection against stress-induced myocardial ischemia. 
3	Examination by logistic regression modelling of the variables which increase the relative risk of elderly women falling compared to elderly men. In a community based, prospective study to determine risk factors for falls, 465 women and 296 men 70 years and over were followed for 1 year and 507 falls were documented. A greater proportion of women (32.7%) than men (23.0%) experienced at least one fall in which there was no or minimal external contribution. Using unconditional logistic regression models we investigated the effect of physical and sociological variables on the sex difference in fall rate. Controlling for the variables age, use of psychotropic drugs, inability to rise from a chair without using arms, going outdoors less than daily and living alone decreased the relative risk of women falling compared to men from 2.02 (95% CI, 1.40-2.92) to 1.55 (95% CI 1.04-2.31). Some of the increased risk of falling associated with being a women was able to be explained and is potentially correctable. But even after controlling for the physical and social variables which we had assessed, women compared to men still had a significantly increased relative risk of falling. 
5	Mutations in the K-ras oncogene induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in preneoplastic and neoplastic rat colonic mucosa. These experiments were conducted to determine whether point mutations activating K-ras or H-ras oncogenes, induced by the procarcinogen 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH), were detectable in preneoplastic or neoplastic rat colonic mucosa. Rats were injected weekly with diluent or DMH at 20 mg/kg body wt for 5, 10, 15, or 25 wk, killed, and their colons dissected. DNA was extracted from diluent-injected control animals, histologically normal colonic mucosa from carcinogen-treated animals, and from carcinomas. Ras mutations were characterized by differential hybridization using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes to polymerase chain reaction--amplified DNA, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. While no H-ras mutations were detectable in any group, K-ras (G to A) mutations were found in 66% of DMH-induced colon carcinomas. These mutations were at the second nucleotide of codons 12 or 13 or the first nucleotide of codon 59 of the K-ras gene. The same type of K-ras mutations were observed in premalignant colonic mucosa from 2 out of 11 rats as early as 15 wk after beginning carcinogen injections when no dysplasia, adenomas, or carcinomas were histologically evident, suggesting that ras mutation may be an early event in colon carcinogenesis. 
2	Percutaneous catheter drainage of infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections. Operative drainage is the cornerstone of therapy for pancreatic abscess. Recently it has been suggested that successful percutaneous catheter drainage of infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections may serve as definitive therapy. We undertook therapeutic, computed tomography-directed percutaneous drainage in a selected group of 29 patients with infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections. Twenty-three patients (79%) were successfully treated with percutaneous drainage. Of six patients (21%) representing failures of percutaneous drainage, four died and two recovered after operative drainage. The four patients who died had a mean APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score of 23 and five of Ranson's prognostic signs. Ranson's signs and APACHE II scores were predictive of success and mortality. We conclude that in selected patients, infected pancreatic and peripancreatic fluid collections can be treated definitively with therapeutic percutaneous catheter drainage. Based on this experience, recommendations regarding patient selection are included. 
1	The contribution of routine follow-up mammography to an early detection of asynchronous contralateral breast cancer. The role of routine mammography was assessed in the early detection of asynchronous contralateral breast cancer (ACBC). The breast cancer patient populations of two cities, Nijmegen and Eindhoven, The Netherlands, which were subjected to a well-defined follow-up program, were compared. The program consisted of regular physical examination and annual mammography in Nijmegen and physical examination only in Eindhoven. From 1975 until 1987, 24 ACBC patients were detected within a group of 880 breast cancer patients in Nijmegen (3%) and, from 1971 until 1984, 14 ACBC patients within a group of 411 patients in Eindhoven (3%). In Nijmegen, eight of the 23 evaluable patients (35%) had a contralateral tumor with a histologic size smaller than 10 mm or an in situ carcinoma, compared with one of the 14 of the Eindhoven patients (7%), whereas 18 of the 24 (75%) versus eight of the 14 patients (57%) were node-negative. Thus annual mammography is very likely a contribution in the early detection of contralateral breast cancer as compared with follow-up by regular physical examination only. 
3	Rehabilitation of quadriparesis secondary to spinal cord sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that rarely involves the spinal cord. This report describes the presentation and rehabilitative course of a 31-yr-old man with quadriparesis secondary to spinal cord sarcoidosis. The patient had insidious, progressive weakness in his arms and legs for six weeks before evaluation. Examination revealed a C4 incomplete spinal cord injury. Computed tomography demonstrated an intrinsic cord lesion from the brainstem to approximately T8. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested the lesion was granulomatous and cervical laminectomy confirmed noncaseating granulomas. The patient was started on high dose steroids, subsequently gained strength in the distal upper extremities, and was sent for spinal cord rehabilitation. Examination revealed 3 to 4+/5 strength in the upper extremities, 2- to 3-/5 in the lower extremities. The right side was slightly stronger than the left, with proximal musculature stronger than distal. Sensory examination was intact except in the C-8 to T-2 dermatomes. The patient was dependent in self-care and mobility except for feeding. Initial progress was inhibited by severe spasticity requiring medication, but by discharge he was independent at the wheelchair level with 4/5 strength in all four extremities except for his hands, which had 3/5 strength. Sensory exam did not change. Follow-up MRI studies revealed reduction of the lesion. Review of previous cases revealed that myelopathy is the most common presenting complaint and cervical segments are most commonly involved. Survival averaged almost three years and significant gains were made in functional status. Rehabilitative course and special considerations, treatment and follow-up recommendations are discussed. 
5	A bleeding risk index for estimating the probability of major bleeding in hospitalized patients starting anticoagulant therapy. PURPOSE: To construct and test prospectively a bleeding risk index for estimating the probability of major bleeding in hospitalized patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an inception cohort of 617 patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy in one hospital, data were gathered retrospectively and bleeding was classified using reliable explicit criteria. We constructed a bleeding risk index by identifying and weighting independent predictors of major bleeding using a multivariate proportional-hazards model. The bleeding risk index was tested in 394 other patients prospectively identified in a second hospital. The index was compared to physicians' predictions. RESULTS: Major bleeding developed before discharge in 61 of all 1,011 patients (6%). The bleeding risk index included four independent risk factors for major in-hospital bleeding: the number of specific comorbid conditions; heparin use in patients aged 60 years or older; maximal prothrombin or partial thromboplastin time 2.0 or more times control; liver dysfunction worsening during therapy. In the testing group, the index predicted major bleeding, which occurred in 3% of 235 low-risk patients, 16% of 96 middle-risk patients, and 19% of 63 high-risk patients (p less than 0.001). The bleeding risk index performed as well as physicians' predictions, and integration of the bleeding risk index with physicians' predictions led to a classification system that was more sensitive (p = 0.03) than physicians' predictions alone. In 86% of patients with a high risk of major bleeding, we identified specific ways of improving therapy, e.g., avoiding overanticoagulation and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents. CONCLUSION: The bleeding risk index provides valid estimates of the probability of major bleeding in hospitalized patients starting long-term anticoagulant therapy and complements physicians' predictions. The possibility that bleeding can be prevented in high-risk patients warrants prospective evaluation. 
5	Rare variant of isolated lower pole hydronephrosis: primary obstructive megaureter. Hydronephrosis in the lower pole moiety of a duplex system is relatively uncommon, usually associated with vesicoureteric reflux. We report on a patient with primary obstructive megaureter of a lower pole moiety that we believe is the first case report in the literature. 
4	Anticardiolipin antibodies in polymyalgia rheumatica-giant cell arteritis: association with severe vascular complications. PURPOSE: We studied a group of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) with or without biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis (GCA) in order to determine the prevalence of anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in these disorders and their association with vascular complications. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study consisted of 50 patients, 30 with PMR alone and 20 with associated GCA. Determinations of IgG and IgM aCL by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were done in the patients and in 50 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. We also measured von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. RESULTS: Twenty-four (48%) of the 50 patients had aCL. Eleven were positive for IgG and five for IgM, whereas eight were positive for both. In the group of patients with PMR alone, only eight (26.6%) had aCL, while 16 of 20 patients (80%) with GCA had these antibodies (p less than 0.01). In the control group, 10 of 50 patients (20%) had positive aCL, a finding that was statistically significantly different only when compared with the finding in patients with GCA (p less than 0.01). Both isotypes of aCL were seen mainly in patients with GCA, and five of these patients had severe vascular complications. Levels of vWF antigen were significantly higher in patients with GCA as compared with patients with PMR alone; however, the highest titers did not correlate with vascular complications. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein were increased but comparable in both groups. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that aCL are prevalent in patients with GCA. These antibodies might imply severe vascular damage and could play an important role in the pathogenesis of the vasculopathy observed in this disease. 
5	Endoscopic comparison of cimetidine and sucralfate for prevention of naproxen-induced acute gastroduodenal injury. Effect of scoring method. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced gastroduodenal mucosal damage observed endoscopically is usually categorized as hemorrhages, erosions, or ulcerations. We undertook this study to determine whether the injury produced by a commonly prescribed NSAID, naproxen, could be reduced by cotherapy with sucralfate or cimetidine and to determine how dependent the differences in the degree of protection against mucosal injury measured were on the scoring system used. Four groups of 20 healthy volunteers with endoscopically normal gastric and duodenal mucosa received naproxen (500 mg twice a day) plus cimetidine (300 mg four times a day or 400 mg twice a day), sucralfate (1 g four times a day), or placebo for seven days. After seven days of therapy, a second endoscopy was performed. Separate scoring systems were used for the presence of hemorrhages, erosions, and a combination of both types of injury. There were significantly fewer mucosal hemorrhages present when naproxen and cimetidine were administered than when naproxen was administered with placebo or sucralfate (placebo vs 300 mg cimetidine, P = 0.04, and placebo vs 400 mg cimetidine, P = 0.006, placebo vs sucralfate, P = 0.26). Both cimetidine dosages resulted in significantly fewer hemorrhages than were present following cotherapy of naproxen and sucralfate (P less than 0.05). In contrast, there was no discernible difference in the mucosal injury between placebo and any drug or between any two active therapies when the injury was evaluated based on the presence of gastric erosions. 
5	Assessment of ventricular septal defect closure by intraoperative epicardial ultrasound. Intraoperative epicardial two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging, color flow mapping and contrast echocardiography were used in 31 patients after patch closure of a ventricular septal defect to determine their respective values in the assessment of residual shunting after cardiopulmonary bypass and for the prediction of long-term results. Epicardial imaging showed no incidence of patch dehiscence. Residual shunting detected by color flow mapping or contrast echocardiography was graded into one of four categories (0 to III). Real time analysis of color flow mapping studies suggested no shunting (grade 0) in 2 patients, grade I shunting in 20, grade II in 8 and grade III in 1; contrast studies suggested grade 0 in 15, grade I in 6, grade II in 8 and grade III in 2. Interobserver variation in real time encoding of grade I or II shunting was 25% by color flow mapping and 6% by contrast echocardiography. Subsequent frame by frame analysis revealed that both diastolic and early systolic right ventricular turbulence gave rise to false positive results during real time analysis of color flow mapping studies. Color flow mapping allowed exact localization of residual shunting, whereas contrast echocardiography allowed better semiquantification. Postbypass results were correlated in 30 patients with late postoperative precordial studies (mean interval 7.5 months). Persistent shunts were found in 6 (20%) of 30 patients. No patient required reoperation for residual shunting. The predictive value of immediate grade I or II shunting as a marker for persistent long-term shunting was poor, whereas both patients with immediate grade III shunting had shunt persistence, indicating that immediate revision should be considered in such patients. Intraoperative epicardial ultrasound is valuable for the immediate exclusion of important residual shunting after ventricular septal defect closure. Maximal information is obtained when color flow mapping and contrast echocardiography are used in combination. 
3	Ichthyosis, mental retardation, and asymptomatic spasticity. A new neurocutaneous syndrome with normal fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. A number of inherited disorders of cornification have been related to abnormal lipid metabolism. In the recessively inherited Sjogren-Larsson syndrome, defined by the triad of ichthyosis, mental retardation, and spasticity, fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase deficiency has recently been reported. These patients accumulate fatty alcohol in the plasma and cultured fibroblasts. A 19-year-old woman with ichthyosis, mental retardation, and mild spasticity is described in whom fatty alcohol metabolism was normal, as determined by plasma octadecanol level and fibroblast fatty alcohol:NAD+ oxidoreductase activity. Ultrastructural studies on skin from the patient revealed morphologically abnormal epidermal lamellar bodies, not unlike those seen in neutral lipid storage disease with ichthyosis. We postulate that this patient has a novel neurocutaneous syndrome that may be secondary to abnormal lipid metabolism. 
3	Evaluation and treatment of mental disorders in patients with AIDS. Mental symptoms are common in patients with AIDS. Optimal management involves the identification and treatment of underlying mental disorders rather than symptomatic treatment alone. Organic mental disorders are very frequent in AIDS, particularly with seriously ill patients who are medical inpatients. There is a high priori probability that such common symptoms as agitation, irritability, and insomnia will be caused by an organic mental disorder. Psychopharmacology in the patient with AIDS requires considerable caution. Lower doses and careful surveillance for subtle neuropsychiatric side effects are necessary. Routine medical contact with a compassionate physician may be of inestimable value to the patient in coping with the fear and dread that surround the illness. 
5	Treatment of de Quervain tenosynovitis. A prospective study of the results of injection of steroids and immobilization in a splint. In a prospective study of non-operative treatment of de Quervain tenosynovitis, ninety-nine wrists of ninety-five consecutively seen patients who had this diagnosis had an injection of one milliliter of a 1 per cent lidocaine solution and one milliliter of a suspension containing forty milligrams of methylprednisolone acetate. Twelve patients (twelve wrists) were lost to follow-up. Of the remaining eighty-seven wrists, fifty-four (62 per cent) had a satisfactory outcome at a mean of eighteen months (minimum follow-up, twelve months). The duration of symptoms before treatment did not affect the outcome. The result in thirty-three wrists (38 per cent) was considered unsatisfactory. Thirty of these wrists were subsequently treated with operative release of the first dorsal compartment, and twenty-two (73 per cent) of the thirty were found to have a separate compartment for the extensor pollicis brevis. The prevalence of a separate compartment is significantly higher than that in the general population, as shown in anatomical studies of cadavera. 
4	Quality of life among hypertensive patients with a diuretic background who are taking atenolol and enalapril. The cardioselective beta-blocker atenolol and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared for efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life factors in 30 patients with hypertension whose hypertension was inadequately controlled with diuretic alone. Atenolol (50 to 100 mg once a day) and enalapril (2.5 to 40 mg once a day), combined with hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg once a day), had similar levels of efficacy and safety. A comprehensive battery of psychologic assessments for quality of life was administered, including measures of anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, memory, and psychomotor function. These five conceptually based clusters were first analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance procedures, followed by univariate analyses of the individual variables composing each domain. In general, neither atenolol nor enalapril was associated with major changes in psychologic functioning. The only data cluster with a statistically significant change was memory function, primarily as a result of lower scores of the digit span (backward) test, for atenolol relative to enalapril. These preliminary findings suggest that atenolol and enalapril have comparable degrees of efficacy and safety, with no major disparities in quality-of-life effects, for hypertensive patients with a history of taking diuretics and this sort of quality-of-life assessment can be performed during trials of antihypertensive drugs. 
4	Triiodothyronine treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon: a controlled trial. The effects of 80 micrograms triiodothyronine (T3) daily were compared with placebo in a double blind controlled crossover trial in 18 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. Reductions in the frequency, duration and severity of attacks while taking T3 were gradual but highly significant. Four of 6 subjects had skin ulcer healing. Skin temperatures in the hands increased significantly. The skin temperature recovery times after cold exposure were significantly shorter during T3 therapy compared with placebo. Although large dosages of T3 were well tolerated, 6 patients experienced episodic palpitations, and slight but significant increases in heart rate and pulse pressure were observed. Evaluation of the use of physiological doses of T3 (60 micrograms daily or less) in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon is suggested. 
3	Vitamin B12 and folate concentrations in serum and cerebrospinal fluid of neurological patients with special reference to multiple sclerosis and dementia. Vitamin B12 and folate concentrations were measured in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 293 neurological patients. Serum and CSF vitamin B12 concentrations showed a positive correlation. In individual patients CSF B12 concentrations varied considerably for a given serum concentration. The median serum vitamin B12 concentration of the Alzheimer's type dementia group was significantly lower compared with that of a control group. Lower median CSF vitamin B12 concentrations were found in groups of patients with multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's type dementia. Five patients with heterogeneous clinical pictures had unexplained low serum and CSF B12 concentrations without macrocytosis. Two patients had very high serum B12 and low-normal CSF concentrations which could be explained by a blood-brain barrier transport defect. Serum and CSF folate concentrations did not show significant differences between the various groups. 
5	Oral estrogens decrease bleeding time and improve clinical bleeding in patients with renal failure. PURPOSE: A prolonged bleeding time is associated with platelet dysfunction and clinical bleeding in patients with renal failure. Parenteral estrogens have been shown to shorten the prolonged bleeding time in patients with chronic renal failure, although the mechanism of action is unknown. We conducted a study to evaluate the efficacy of oral conjugated estrogens in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four patients with renal failure, prolonged bleeding time, and clinical bleeding were given 50 mg of conjugated estrogen (Premarin) daily. RESULTS: Bleeding time normalized in two cases and was reduced to less than 50% of the pretreatment value in one of the remaining two cases. Bleeding stopped in all patients within two days. Ten dialysis patients with prolonged bleeding time were randomized to a course of 50 mg of Premarin daily or placebo. The bleeding time in all five patients in the Premarin group normalized or decreased to below 50% of the pretreatment value after 7.0 +/- 4.2 days of therapy. The bleeding time did not normalize in the five patients treated with placebo. No side effects attributable to therapy were reported. CONCLUSION: We conclude that orally administered conjugated estrogens effectively improve the bleeding tendency in patients with chronic renal failure. 
1	1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 receptor RNA: expression in hematopoietic cells. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] induces differentiation and inhibits proliferation of myeloid leukemic cells from various lines and patients; these effects are probably mediated through the 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor. Little is known of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in hematopoietic cells. We examined the expression and modulation of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in various proliferating and nonproliferating hematopoietic cells. Constitutive expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA was detected in various kinds of hematopoietic cells, including macrophages and activated T lymphocytes, as well as in cell lines KG-1 (myeloblasts), HL-60 (promyelocytes), ML-3 (myelomonoblasts), U937, THP-1 (monoblasts), K562 (erythroblasts), and S-LB1 (HTLV-1-transfected T lymphocytes). Receptor transcripts were 4.6 kilobases (kb), and no variant sizes were observed. All cell lines examined in this group also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors. Most B lymphocyte lines expressed negligible levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA and protein; however; analysis of a lymphoid/myeloid somatic hybrid suggested that suppression of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in B lymphocytes may be a dominant characteristic. HL-60 cells were cultured with 10(-7) mol/L 1,25(OH)2D3 for 24 to 72 hours, and levels of expression of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor and its RNA were examined. Levels of RNA coding for the receptor were not modulated by exposure to high levels of ligand. Levels of occupied 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor protein increased in these HL-60 cells; but the total number of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors decreased about 50% at 24 hours and returned toward normal at 72 hours. Steady-state levels of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA were not affected by terminal differentiation of HL-60 toward either granulocytes or macrophages. Nondividing macrophages from normal individuals also expressed 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA. In contrast, nondividing peripheral blood lymphocytes from normal individuals did not express 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA; with stimulation of proliferation of these cells, accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased markedly. Half-life (t1/2) of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA in T lymphocytes was short (1 hour) as determined by measuring decay of the message after addition of actinomycin D. Consistent with this short t1/2, accumulation of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptor RNA increased in cells as their protein synthesis was inhibited. Further studies are required to understand the physiologic role of 1,25(OH)2D3 receptors in myeloid cells and proliferating T lymphocytes. 
5	Sinus arrest induced by trivial nasal stimulation during alfentanil-nitrous oxide anaesthesia. A case is reported of bradycardia and sinus arrest induced by insertion of a nasal temperature probe. Other possible causes of bradycardia and sinus arrest under anaesthesia are reviewed briefly. Evidence for the neurological basis of a nasocardiac reflex, similar to the oculocardiac reflex, is presented. A minor, trivial stimulus may elicit this reflex. 
4	Intraoperative ultrasonic imaging of the ascending aorta in ischemic heart disease. In an attempt to locate any atherosclerotic lesion in the ascending aorta and to prevent embolization, intraoperative B-mode ultrasonography was performed in 100 patients with ischemic heart disease (31 women and 69 men). Ultrasonography was carried out with a 10-MHz probe placed directly on the ascending aorta. Ultrasonic imaging demonstrated an atherosclerotic lesion in the lower half of the aorta in 76 patients (76%), a lesion in the upper half of the aorta in 89 patients (89%), and a lesion at the orifice of the innominate artery in 99 patients (99%). Prospective palpation identified an atherosclerotic lesion in 12 (25%) of 48 patients. Thoracic computed tomography in 79 patients showed calcification in the lower half of the aorta in 6 patients (7.6%) and in the upper half of the aorta in 11 (13.9%). Palpation and thoracic computed tomography underestimated the frequency of atherosclerotic lesions. Intraoperative ultrasonography accurately identified atherosclerotic disease. This technique allows the surgeon to modify cannulation, aortic clamping, and operative technique to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke due to embolization of atherosclerotic debris from the ascending aorta. 
5	Bronchial asthma. Asthma is one of the most common respiratory problems in modern industrialized countries, affecting over 5% of the population. It affects all age groups from infants to senior citizens, and mortality rates from asthma appear to be increasing during the past few years in the United States as well as in other industrialized countries. Asthma tends to occur in families, associated with other allergic disease, and may be induced by a wide variety of environmental antigens, most commonly inhaled allergens such as pollen and dust. Bronchial challenge with a specific allergen results in an early bronchospastic response with a relatively brief duration, and in a significant number of patients there is a late response with onset after 3 to 4 hours, lasting hours to days. This late response is associated with a bronchial hypersensitivity reaction, which is demonstrable by nonspecific challenge testing in the laboratory. During the period of bronchial hyperresponsiveness patients are prone to develop attacks following exposure to a wide variety of "triggers," including cold air, fumes, or cigarette smoke. The current approach to management of patients with asthma emphasizes prevention, with avoidance of specific allergens when possible, and chronic use of anti-inflammatory agents including corticosteroids and cromolyn sodium. The goal is to decrease the bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Management of the acute asthma attack consists of bronchodilator therapy, primarily with inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists, and administration of oral or systemic corticosteroids if the attack is not rapidly relieved. Additional therapeutic agents including theophylline and anticholinergics may be useful in some situations. Response to therapy during the first couple of hours in the emergency room is the most important predictor of the course of the acute attack, and patients who have not responded significantly after 2 hours of maximum therapy are candidates for hospital admission or prolonged emergency room observation. The goal of acute therapy is to wean the patient from intravenous drugs and place him or her on rapidly tapering doses of oral prednisone while initiating a vigorous program of preventive therapy. Follow-up observation, both in the office and in the patient's home, is vital and involves extensive patient education and objective testing of peak airflow. In general, the course of asthma is relatively benign compared with other obstructive airway diseases; however, significant mortality exists, especially in older patients and those with late-onset asthma. 
4	Complete heart block and severe aortic incompetence in relapsing polychondritis: clinicopathologic findings. We describe a patient with relapsing polychondritis who developed fatal cardiac involvement comprising complete heart block, acute aortic incompetence, and cardiovascular collapse. Pathologic studies showed fibrosis of the cardiac conducting system and necrotizing inflammation of the aortic valve, features not previously described in relapsing polychondritis, as well as evidence of coronary artery vasculitis. 
3	Codeine increases pain thresholds to copper vapor laser stimuli in extensive but not poor metabolizers of sparteine. The analgesic efficacy and kinetics of a single oral dose of 75 mg codeine was investigated in 12 extensive metabolizers and 12 poor metabolizers of sparteine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The cosegregation of the O-demethylation of codeine to morphine with the sparteine oxidation polymorphism was confirmed. Hence morphine could not be detected in the plasma of any of the poor metabolizers, whereas detectable morphine plasma levels were found in 10 of 12 extensive metabolizers. Pain thresholds to laser stimuli were determined before drug intake and 90, 150, and 210 minutes after drug intake. Codeine significantly increased the pricking pain thresholds in the extensive metabolizers (p less than 0.05), whereas there were no significant changes in the poor metabolizers. No change in pain thresholds occurred with placebo in any of the two phenotypes. In the extensive metabolizers there was a significant positive correlation between the increase in pain threshold and plasma concentration of codeine. The study supports the hypothesis that morphine formation is essential for achievement of analgesia during codeine treatment. 
2	Metabolic and health complications of obesity. Overnutrition manifested by obesity has emerged as a major health problem in affluent countries. In spite of increased interest in fitness, obesity is on the increase in the United States. This is particularly so among children and adolescents. Although obesity is associated with many risk factors for diseases, the mechanisms whereby it enhances disease risk are not fully understood. Such an understanding is needed to develop strategies for management of these conditions. In this report we suggest that overnutrition produces clinical diseases only in individuals who already possess a metabolic weakness or "defect" in a given system. In the absence of such underlying defects, overnutrition, or obesity, is well tolerated. One of the most common consequences of obesity is dyslipidemia, that is, elevations of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The major effect of overnutrition on lipoprotein metabolism is to stimulate the production of VLDL. For patients who have an underlying defect in lypolysis of VLDL triglycerides, hypertriglyceridemia will develop in the obese state. For those who have defective clearance of LDL, obesity will accentuate hypercholesterolemia. Both of these effects can be explained by overproduction of VLDL, due to obesity, combined with a genetic defect in clearance of VLDL or LDL. The mechanism whereby obesity causes a lowering of HDL cholesterol is uncertain, although it could enhance removal of HDL by an excess of adipose tissue. Another disease associated with obesity is cholesterol gallstones. The presence of obesity more than doubles the risk for gallstones. Two underlying factors increase the danger for gallstones: a deficiency of hepatic secretion of bile acids and a tendency for formation of cholesterol crystals in bile. Overnutrition promotes the synthesis of whole-body cholesterol, and the only route for excretion of this excess cholesterol is through the biliary tree.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
4	Primary angioplasty in myocardial infarction: assessment of improved myocardial perfusion with technetium-99m isonitrile. Technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy-2-isobutyl-isonitrile (technetium-99m isonitrile) is a new radiopharmaceutical compound that reflects myocardial perfusion. Its kinetics, especially its lack of redistribution after intravenous administration, permits the assessment of changes in myocardial perfusion without delay of therapy. Tomographic images at rest were obtained immediately and 6 to 10 days later in 17 consecutive patients undergoing successful primary angioplasty during their first transmural myocardial infarction. Thirteen patients had anterior infarction. The initial (acute) defect size before angioplasty of 48 +/- 17% of the left ventricle decreased significantly (p less than 0.0001) to 29 +/- 19% on the late scans. There was no correlation between the time to therapy and the reduction in defect size. Twelve of the 17 patients, including 7 of the 11 patients treated after 4 h, demonstrated a definite reduction in the initial defect size. Eight patients with angiographically proved persistent coronary occlusion underwent a similar imaging sequence. The initial defect size in this group remained unchanged on the late scans (24 +/- 16% versus 26 +/- 18%, p = NS). Primary angioplasty is an effective approach toward salvaging myocardium; comparison with thrombolytic drug therapy must await the results of controlled clinical trials. 
5	Pontine supranuclear facial palsy. Two patients presented with a unilateral supranuclear facial palsy. Additional dysarthria was attributed to the pontine origin documented by magnetic resonance imaging on the contralateral side. The pontine disorder also was indicated by an isolated delay of the blink reflex R1 component or of the masseter reflex. We attribute the facial palsy to a lesion of a supranuclear fiber bundle supplying the facial nucleus. The location of the lesions favors these fibers taking a separate course from the main pyramidal tract at the mid- to upper pontine level. 
1	Monoclonal antibody to the interferon-inducible protein Leu-13 triggers aggregation and inhibits proliferation of leukemic B cells. Interferon (IFN)-alpha inhibits DNA synthesis stimulated by low molecular weight B-cell growth factor (BCGF) in hairy cells in vitro, suggesting that the therapeutic efficacy of IFN-alpha in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) involves growth inhibition of malignant B cells. Evidence that the 16-Kd cell surface protein Leu-13 mediates an antiproliferative signal in T lymphocytes and is IFN-inducible in endothelial cells prompted us to examine the expression and functional role of this molecule in leukemic B cells. Leu-13 density, determined by flow cytometry, was upregulated in vitro and in vivo by IFN-alpha on malignant B cells from patients with HCL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia. Monoclonal anti-Leu-13 triggered homotypic aggregation of leukemic B cells via an adhesion pathway that was not inhibited by antibodies to leukocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Moreover, anti-Leu-13 potentiated the inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha on BCGF-stimulated DNA synthesis, assessed by [3H]-thymidine and [3H]-deoxyadenosine incorporation into DNA. These results indicate that Leu-13 is part of a novel IFN-inducible signaling pathway which may modify the growth and adhesive properties of leukemic B cells under physiologic or therapeutic conditions. 
5	Pediatric blunt liver injury and coagulopathy managed with packs and a silo: case report. Packing the abdomen can be lifesaving when severe hepatic trauma is complicated by refractory hypothermia, coagulopathy, and continuing hemorrhage requiring large-volume transfusion. This report describes the successful use of abdominal packs and a modified silo in a child following blunt liver injury. 
5	Malignant transformation of adenomatous hyperplasia to hepatocellular carcinoma. To clarify the course of adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver, 17 patients with 20 biopsy-proven AH nodules were followed clinically for 1-5 years. At the initial biopsy the mean nodular diameter was 10 (SD 4) mm and the relative cellularity [( mean cellularity of AH divided by mean parenchymal cellularity] x 100) 141 (27). The criteria for diagnosis of malignant transformation of AH were both a doubling of nodular volume and changes on imaging. Between 6 and 50 months after biopsy, 9 of the 18 nodules which could still be accurately identified met the criteria for transformation; histological proof of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was obtained later for 7 of these 9 nodules. The product of diameter and cellularity (transformation index) was the strongest predictor of the time to transformation. 9 AH nodules did not undergo transformation--7 did not meet one or both criteria and 2 became undetectable by imaging. Because of the high risk of malignant transformation, it can be concluded that AH is an absolute precursor of HCC. It should therefore be treated as a potential malignant disorder. 
5	Analysis of 24-hour esophageal pressure and pH data in unselected patients with noncardiac chest pain. Fourty-four unselected patients with noncardiac chest pain were studied using conventional manometry with additional edrophonium provocation and 24-hour ambulatory esophageal pH and pressure recording with a system developed by our group. New, fully automated techniques of statistical analysis of the complete set of esophageal pressure and pH signals were used to examine the temporal relation between pain, esophageal motility disturbances, and gastroesophageal reflux. The analysis used the 97.5th percentile of amplitude and duration of all esophageal contractions in each patient as well as a chi 2 test of the distribution of contraction types to determine whether a pain episode was related to abnormal motility or not. The edrophonium test results were positive in 2 patients. Only 25 patients (56.8%) had at least one pain episode (total, 111 episodes) during 24-hour recording. Thirty-three percent of the pain episodes were related to reflux and 23.4% to abnormal motility, and 43.2% were not related to an esophageal function disturbance. In the patient-oriented analysis in this study, it was required for a positive correlation that the symptom index (percentage of related pain episodes) was higher than 75%. It was found that the pain was related to reflux in 2 patients (4.6%), to reflux and motor abnormalities in 4 (9.2%), and to motor abnormalities in 2 patients (4.6%). In 36 patients (81.8%), no relation with an esophageal abnormality could be established, either because the patients had no pain during the 24-hour study, or because the pain seemed unrelated to reflux or abnormal motility. 
5	Papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome. We report five cases of an acute, self-limiting dermatosis that has not been previously described. It consists of a pruritic edema and erythema of the hands and feet in a gloves-and-socks distribution and is associated with oral lesions and fever. The clinical course is characterized by the rapid development of petechial purpura and clearing of lesions within 1 to 2 weeks. The disease appears to affect only young and otherwise healthy persons and occurs mostly during the spring. The etiology is unknown but might be of infectious origin. 
1	Complications of general anesthesia for Nd:YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors. We studied the incidence and mechanisms of cardiovascular complications and postoperative respiratory insufficiency associated with GA and Nd:YAG laser endobronchial tumor resection. The records of 73 patients undergoing 87 procedures were reviewed. Preoperative status, anesthetic methods and perioperative complications were analyzed by multiple regression to determine predictors of outcome. Twenty-three percent of patients had greater than 90 percent mainstem bronchus obstruction. Longer serum elimination half-life of relaxant drug was significantly correlated with longer duration of mechanical ventilation after neuromuscular blockade reversal. Cardiovascular complications were noted in 24 procedures and often required therapeutic intervention. Variables predicting cardiovascular complications included longer duration of GA and increasing age. Perioperative respiratory and cardiovascular complications are common after GA for Nd: YAG laser resection. Short-acting neuromuscular relaxants, careful assessment prior to postoperative extubation, limiting duration of GA and cardiovascular monitoring are recommended when implementing GA for Nd: YAG laser resection of endobronchial tumors. 
3	Brain retractor edema during induced hypotension: the effect of the rate of return of blood pressure. This study evaluated the hypothesis that the postoperative formation of cerebral edema may be influenced by the rate of blood pressure return after induced hypotension in a graded brain retractor injury. Nineteen cats underwent unilateral craniotomy, isoflurane-induced hypotension to a mean of 50 mm Hg, and application of a brain retractor at 20 mm Hg of pressure for 1 hour. Blood pressure was returned to normal either within 3 minutes or over 20 minutes. The degree of cerebral edema formation was determined by Evans blue dye and coronal magnetic resonance imaging. All animals showed extravasation of Evans blue dye in the retracted hemisphere that was most marked at the periphery of the retractor. T1 relaxation times were significantly prolonged in the retracted hemispheres of both the fast return and slow return groups (18.8% and 17.8%, respectively) and more so at the Evans blue sites (42.8% and 40.8%), although not so strikingly beneath the retractor itself (6.3% and 7.8%). T2 relaxation times were similarly prolonged but to approximately half the degree of the T1 times. In the nonretracted hemisphere, drug-induced hypotension alone did not result in significant acute cerebral edema or blood-brain barrier alteration. There was no significant difference between the fast and slow groups in Evans blue extravasation or magnetic resonance changes. Thus, in a retractor-induced brain injury, restoration of arterial pressure to normal either gradually or rapidly did not influence the degree or extent of edema formation. 
4	Roles of renal and vascular renin in spontaneous hypertension and switching of the mechanism upon nephrectomy. Lack of hypotensive effects of inhibition of renin, converting enzyme, and angiotensin II receptor blocker after bilateral nephrectomy. Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme, renin, and the angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor lower the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) used as a model of essential hypertension. Since their plasma renin levels were normal or subnormal, renin in the vascular tissue was considered to play a key role in the maintenance of the hypertension. To clarify the source and localization of renin in SHR, antirenin antibodies, the converting enzyme inhibitors delapril, enalapril, and the Ang II receptor antagonist DuP 753 were administered to intact and bilaterally nephrectomized SHR and their normotensive controls. The efficient hypotensive action of the renin antibody indicated that renin of renal origin is a dominant factor. Gradual but complete disappearance of antihypertensive action of these inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system upon bilateral nephrectomy indicated the importance of membrane-associated renin of the renal origin and angiotensin converting enzyme in the maintenance of the spontaneous hypertension. 
2	Effects of cisapride in patients with cystic fibrosis and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we investigated the effects of the prokinetic drug cisapride in patients with cystic fibrosis and chronic recurrent distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). After a baseline period, 17 patients (12.9 to 34.9 years; 12 boys) received, in random order, cisapride (7.5 to 10 mg) and placebo three times daily by mouth, each for 6 months. Gastrointestinal symptoms (flatulence, abdominal pain, fullness, abdominal distension, nausea, anorexia, heartburn, diarrhea, vomiting and regurgitation) were scored three times monthly and physical examinations assessed. At baseline and at each 6-month period, assessment included food intake for 7 days, 3-day stool collection, pulmonary function tests, and abdominal radiographs. During cisapride therapy compared with placebo, there were significant reductions in flatulence (p less than 0.005), fullness, and nausea (p less than 0.05). Patients with the worst symptom scores benefited most from cisapride. With cisapride, 12 patients felt better and three worse (p less than 0.05); physicians judged 11 patients improved and two worse (p less than 0.05). No side effects were noted. There were no significant differences between cisapride and placebo periods in nutritional status, x-ray scores, pulmonary function, food intake (fat, protein, calories), stool size and consistency, and fecal losses of fat, bile acids, chymotrypsin, and calories. For acute episodes of DIOS, intestinal lavage was needed 6 times in 4 patients during treatment with cisapride, and 11 times in 6 patients receiving placebo. In comparison with unselected patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency who were receiving enzyme supplements and who had no distal intestinal obstruction, fecal fat losses (percentage of intake) were almost twice as high in the study group with DIOS (31.2 +/- 20.6% vs 16.2 +/- 17.6%; p less than 0.01). We conclude that in the dosage used, long-term treatment with cisapride appears to improve chronic abdominal symptoms in patients with cystic fibrosis and DIOS, but fails to abolish the need for intestinal lavage. Cisapride treatment had no effect on digestion and nutritional status of cystic fibrosis patients with pancreatic insufficiency. 
5	Widespread inflammatory response to osteoblastoma: the flare phenomenon. A case of vertebral osteoblastoma caused a diffuse, reactive inflammatory infiltrate in two vertebrae, adjacent ribs, and the paraspinous soft tissues. The authors call this the flare phenomenon. On magnetic resonance images the diffuse inflammatory response caused a misleading appearance that simulated a malignant process (lymphoma or Ewing sarcoma). A computed tomographic myelogram was diagnostic. 
5	The empiric use of naloxone in patients with altered mental status: a reappraisal. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine whether clinical criteria (respirations of 12 or less, mitotic pupils, and circumstantial evidence of opiate abuse) could predict response to naloxone in patients with acute alteration of mental status (AMS) and to evaluate whether such criteria predict a final diagnosis of presence or absence of opiate overdose as accurately as response to naloxone. CASES AND SETTING: Seven hundred thirty patients with AMS who received naloxone for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes at the discretion of two large, urban, paramedic base teaching hospitals. METHODS: We reviewed paramedic run sheets and audiotapes on all 730 patients as well as available hospital records of all patients who demonstrated any response to naloxone to determine whether overdose was responsible for their clinical presentations. We also reviewed hospital records for a selected sample of naloxone nonresponders. MAIN RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Only 25 patients (3.4%) demonstrated a complete response to naloxone, whereas 32 (4.4%) manifested a partial or equivocal response. Nineteen of 25 complete responders (76%), two of 26 partial responders (8%) (with known final diagnosis), and four of 195 non-responders (2%) (with known final diagnosis) were ultimately diagnosed as having overdosed. Respirations of 12 or less or the presence of any one of the three clinical findings as a group were each highly sensitive in predicting response to naloxone, and at least as sensitive as response to naloxone in predicting a diagnosis of opiate overdose. Selective administration of naloxone for AMS would have decreased the use of this drug by 75% to 90% while still administering it to virtually all naloxone responders who had a final diagnosis of opiate overdose. 
2	Quantification of hepatobiliary function as an integral part of imaging with technetium-99m-mebrofenin in health and disease. A study was undertaken to check the feasibility of measuring the hepatic extraction fraction (HEF) and excretion T-1/2 values as an integral part of hepatobiliary imaging with technetium-99m-mebrofenin in health and disease. In 18 controls subjects, the HEF was 100% and the T-1/2 excretion mean +/- s.e. value was 15.23 +/- 1.4 min. The mean appearance times of the common bile duct (CBD), gallbladder (GB), and small intestine were 15.8 +/- 1.52, 20.2 +/- 2.7, and 23.8 +/- 3.08 min, respectively. Rising serum bilirubin in patients decreased HEF and increased T-1/2 excretion value resulting in delayed appearance of CBD, GB, and small intestine. In control subjects and patients with bilirubin less than 5 mg%, T-1/2 excretion values at 30, 40, and 50 min were similar to those values calculated using the entire 60 min of data, suggesting that the hepatic phase study time could be reduced to 30-40 min and still use the normal reference values established for 60 min. In patients with bilirubin greater than 5 mg%, the data collection duration should be continued for 60 min. 
4	Studies of myocardial protection in the immature heart. IV. Improved tolerance of immature myocardium to hypoxia and ischemia by intravenous metabolic support. Thirteen immature puppies (2 to 4 kg) underwent 1 hour of acute hypoxia (oxygen tension 25 to 30 mm Hg), followed by 45 minutes of normothermic global ischemia on total vented bypass with normal blood reperfusion. Ventricular function was assessed by inscribing Starling function curves and measuring stroke work indices before hypoxia and after reperfusion. Seven puppies (control) received normal saline infusion at 4 ml/kg/hr. Six other puppies received a 4 ml/kg/hr intravenous infusion of glutamate/aspartate, glucose-insulin-potassium, mercaptopropionyl glycine, carnitine, and catalase during hypoxia and reperfusion. In control hearts, acute hypoxia depleted myocardial glutamate and aspartate by 52% (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia) and 48% (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia) and caused severe hemodynamic deterioration (55% decrease of stroke work index) (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia); three of seven (43%) required premature institution of bypass. Postischemic left ventricular function recovered to only 40% of control levels (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia). In contrast, intravenous metabolic infusions maintained tissue glutamate (p less than 0.05 versus control group) and aspartate (p less than 0.05 versus control group) in treated hearts during hypoxia and allowed cardiac index to rise 20% (p less than 0.05 versus prehypoxia); all treated hearts tolerated 1 hour of hypoxia, and stroke work recovered 70% (p less than 0.05 versus control group) of stroke work index after subsequent ischemia. Impaired tolerance of immature hearts to acute hypoxia and subsequent ischemia is due to substrate depletion. This impairment can be reduced by intravenous metabolic support during hypoxia and reperfusion and leads to improved recovery of postischemic function. 
5	An unusual complication of cardiac transplantation--infected aortic pseudoaneurysm. Infections after cardiac transplantation are a frequent cause of early morbidity and mortality. An unusual site for such a complication is at the aortic anastomotic suture line. We report a case of an infected aortic pseudoaneurysm, seen as recurrent septicemia, during the first 6 months after cardiac transplantation. 
5	Extramedullary hematopoiesis involving the esophagus in myelofibrosis. In this report, we describe a case of myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia; a 53-yr-old man was splenectomized for a massively enlarged spleen in which multiple foci of myeloid metaplasia were histologically demonstrated. The patient was referred to us for endoscopic examination, following the repeated occurrence of melena. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed two active ulcerative lesions in the bulb, and only a moderate erythema in the lower third of the esophagus, which showed no varices. There was no endoscopic evidence of active or recent bleeding. Subsequent histologic examination of biopsies taken from the esophageal lesion surprisingly revealed the presence of hematopoietic tissue. 
1	Location of port-wine stains and the likelihood of ophthalmic and/or central nervous system complications. Of 310 patients with port-wine stains, 68% had more than one dermatome involved; 85% had unilateral and 15% had a bilateral distribution of their port-wine stain. At the time of examination, 8% of all patients with trigeminal port-wine stains had evidence of eye and/or central nervous system (CNS) involvement. Extensive involvement, with port-wine stain over the trunk and extremities as well as the head and neck, was observed in 12%. Patients who did not have port-wine stains on the areas served by branches V1 and V2 of the trigeminal nerve had no signs or symptoms of eye and/or CNS involvement. Port-wine stains of the eyelids, bilateral distribution of the birthmark, and unilateral port-wine stains involving all three branches of the trigeminal nerve were associated with a significantly higher likelihood of having eye and/or CNS complications. Twenty-four percent of those with bilateral trigeminal nerve port-wine stains had eye and/or CNS involvement compared with 6% of those with unilateral lesions. All those who had eye and/or CNS complications had port-wine stain involvement of the eyelids; in 91% both upper and lower eyelids were involved, whereas in 9% only the lower eyelid was involved. None of those with upper eyelid port-wine stains alone had eye and/or CNS complications. In addition, 3 (75%) of the 4 subjects with seizures alone had bilateral port-wine stain involvement. A third group, these with unilateral V1, V2, and V3 port-wine stains, had eye and/or CNS complications in 3 (19%) of 16 subjects. 
5	Effects of pill-giving on maintenance of placebo response in patients with chronic mild depression Fifty outpatients with mild, chronic, mood-reactive depression whose mood improved markedly after a 10-day single-blind placebo trial were randomly assigned in a double-blind design either to have their placebo medication discontinued or to have it maintained for an additional 6 weeks. Half of the patients in each condition relapsed within 6 weeks, indicating that pill-taking itself does not influence maintenance of placebo response. Placebo response was more likely to be maintained in patients who were currently married. At the end of 3 months, the overall relapse rate was 58%. The authors raise questions about the utility of the initial 10-day placebo washout in antidepressant clinical trials, and they discuss limits on the generalizability of their findings. 
4	Takayasu's disease with axillary, right coronary artery, and right internal mammary stenosis treated with angioplasty. A 47-year-old woman presented with progressive angina and failed medical therapy. After an unsuccessful attempt at angioplasty of a totally occluded right coronary artery, coronary artery bypass using the right internal mammary artery was performed. She presented 2 years later with stenosis in the mammary graft, right coronary artery, and axillary artery. These lesions were all treated with angioplasty. 
4	Opioids in cerebrospinal fluid in hypotensive newborn pigs. This study was designed to determine if opioids were detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and if these concentrations were altered by hemorrhagic hypotension. This study was further designed to determine the effects of topically administered opioids on pial arteriolar diameter during normotension and hypotension. Closed cranial windows were used to determine pial arteriolar diameter. Periarachnoid cortical and cisterna magna CSF was collected from piglets during normotension and hypotension (systemic arterial pressure decreased from 63 +/- 1 to 33 +/- 1 mm Hg). Opioid profiles were assessed qualitatively by radioreceptor assay, and individual opioids were measured quantitatively by radioimmunoassay. Periarachnoid cortical and cisterna magna CSF methionine enkephalin-, leucine enkephalin-, dynorphin-, and beta-endorphin-like receptor active values all were increased by hypotension. When quantified by radioimmunoassay, periarachnoid cortical CSF values for methionine enkephalin-like immunoreactivity were 1,167 +/- 58 and 2,975 +/- 139 pg/ml for normotension and hypotension, respectively. Periarachnoid cortical CSF radioimmunoassay values for dynorphin-like immunoreactivity were 15 +/- 2 and 28 +/- 2 pg/ml for normotension and hypotension, respectively. When applied topically to the cortical surface, synthetic methionine enkephalin increased pial arteriolar diameter (134 +/- 4, 158 +/- 4, and 163 +/- 4 microns for control, 574 pg/ml [10(-10) M], and 5,740 pg/ml [10(-9) M], respectively). Similarly, topical synthetic leucine enkephalin and dynorphin elicited pial arteriolar dilation. However, beta-endorphin produced arteriolar constriction. Hypotension attenuated methionine and leucine enkephalin-induced dilation and reversed dynorphin-induced dilation to concentration-dependent constriction. beta-Endorphin-induced constriction was not changed by hypotension. Therefore, opioids could contribute to the control of the cerebral circulation during hypotension. 
4	Responses of cytosolic free calcium to ADP in platelets of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Abnormalities of Ca2+ handling have been reported in patients with essential hypertension and in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). In this study, responses of cytosolic Ca2+ to ADP in platelets of SHR were examined. Four- and seven-week-old male SHR and age- and sex-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were used. Basal levels of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration in platelets and responses to ADP were estimated using fluorescent indicator fura-2 in the medium containing 1 mmol/L CaCl2 and Ca2(+)-free buffer with 1 mmol/L EGTA. Basal levels of platelet cytosolic Ca2+ of SHR were significantly higher than those of WKY at 4 and 7 weeks of age in the presence of external Ca2+. However, no significant difference was observed in basal levels of platelet cytosolic Ca2+ in the Ca2(+)-free EGTA-containing buffer between SHR and WKY. The peak cytosolic Ca2+ concentration evoked by ADP was significantly diminished in SHR compared with WKY in the absence of external Ca2+, whereas the responses of platelet cytosolic Ca2+ to ADP were similar in SHR and WKY in the presence of external Ca2+. These results suggest that release from intracellular Ca2+ store is reduced in SHR and that the regulation of cytosolic Ca2+ in SHR is more dependent on extracellular Ca2+ compared with WKY. 
2	Pelvic floor descent in women: dynamic evaluation with fast MR imaging and cinematic display. The authors present a new method for assessing pelvic prolapse with dynamic fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Twenty-six women with signs and symptoms suggesting pelvic prolapse and 16 control subjects were studied with a series of fast (6-12-second) MR images. Sagittal and coronal images were obtained with graded increase in voluntary pelvic strain, allowing for dynamic display and quantification of the pelvic prolapse process. The distance from the pubococcygeal line was used as an internal reference for measurement of descent in the maximal strain position. With use of control results for normal limit values, prolapse involving the anterior pelvic compartment (cystocele), the middle compartment (vaginal prolapse, uterine prolapse, and enterocele), and the posterior compartment (rectocele) was easily demonstrated. Significant differences between control subjects and patients with prolapse were seen at maximal strain but not in the relaxed state. Quantification of the pelvic descent process with use of fast MR imaging may be of value in surgical planning and postsurgical follow-up. 
4	End-stage renal disease--is infrainguinal limb revascularization justified? Reports of reconstructive surgery for peripheral vascular disease have been relatively uncommon in patients with end-stage renal disease. Between 1980 and 1989, 39 patients with end-stage renal disease underwent revascularization of 56 limbs. Fifty-two primary infrainguinal and four secondary infrainguinal bypass grafts were performed. In addition, nine thrombectomies were performed. At the time of surgery 37 patients were on dialysis; three had functioning kidney transplants. The indications for revascularization were gangrene, rest pain, or ulceration in all except three limbs with disabling claudication. Reversed, nonreversed, or in situ vein was used in 25 of the 52 primary infrainguinal revascularizations performed. Polytetrafluoroethylene was used in 25. Two procedures used a combination of polytetrafluoroethylene and vein. The primary patencies for all infrainguinal procedures at 1 and 2 years were 77% and 68%, respectively. Four perioperative deaths occurred in the infrainguinal group (7.7%). An additional death occurred after thrombectomy for late graft closure. Three deaths were a result of myocardial infarction. One patient on peritoneal dialysis developed uncontrolled sepsis. At 3 years 39% of patients were alive, and 84% of the limbs were salvaged. Among the cases studied no group was identified that represented unacceptable operative risk. Results compared well with reported patencies for patients subjected to infrainguinal revascularization procedures. Limb revascularization in patients with end-stage renal disease may be performed by use of similar criteria to those used for other patients with peripheral vascular disease. 
5	Acute promyelocytic leukemia: impact of hemorrhagic complications on response to induction chemotherapy and survival. From 1976 to 1989, 21 adult patients with previously untreated acute promyelocytic leukemia were seen at the University of Virginia Hospital. We reviewed their cases retrospectively to determine the impact of hemorrhagic complications and other factors on treatment outcome. We observed a complete remission rate of 35%; the median survival in complete responders was 15 months. Evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation was found in 13 (62%) of the 21 cases at diagnosis. Fatal intracranial hemorrhage was the leading cause of death, occurring in eight (40%) of the 20 patients evaluated. Initial leukocyte count greater than 4.0 x 10(9)/L and platelet count less than 20 x 10(9)/L were significantly associated with an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. In patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation, the rate of intracranial hemorrhage was reduced by treatment with heparin. The high mortality of 40% (8/20) due to intracranial hemorrhage during induction was a major contributor to the low complete remission rate of 35% (7/20) in this series of consecutive unselected patients with newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia. 
1	Results of stereotactic brachytherapy used in the initial management of patients with glioblastoma. Recent studies have shown a survival benefit for patients with recurrent glioblastomas treated with stereotactic brachytherapy. On the basis of these encouraging results, we began a prospective study in 1987 to evaluate the use of brachytherapy in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Patients were considered eligible for this study if they met the following criteria: Karnofsky performance status 70% or greater; tumor size not greater than 5 cm in any dimension; a radiographically well delineated, supratentorial lesion not involving the ependymal surfaces; and pathologically confirmed glioblastoma. We treated 35 such patients between 1987 and 1990 with stereotactic brachytherapy as part of their initial therapy. The treatment protocol involved surgery, partial brain external-beam radiotherapy (59.4 Gy in 33 fractions), and stereotactic brachytherapy with temporary high-activity iodine 125 sources giving an additional 50 Gy to the tumor bed. Chemotherapy was not used in the initial management of these 35 patients. To compare our results with those obtained in a matched control group, we identified 40 patients with glioblastoma treated with surgery and external radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy, between 1977 and 1986 at our institution. These patients had clinical and radiographic characteristics that would have made them eligible for the brachytherapy protocol. Survival rates at 1 and 2 years after diagnosis were 87% and 57%, respectively, for patients receiving brachytherapy versus 40% and 12.5%, respectively, for the controls (P less than .001). We conclude that stereotactic brachytherapy improves the survival of patients with glioblastoma when it can be incorporated into the initial treatment approach. Unfortunately, only about one in four patients with glioblastoma are suitable candidates for brachytherapy at the time of initial presentation. 
3	Syphilitic meningomyelitis. A 28-year-old nonimmunocompromised man developed secondary syphilis confirmed by serum and CSF findings. His course was complicated by chorioretinitis, extensive skin lesions, and spastic paraparesis secondary to syphilitic meningomyelitis. MRI of the spinal cord was strikingly abnormal. 
3	Tonic contraversive ocular tilt reaction due to unilateral meso-diencephalic lesion. We studied 4 patients with tonic contraversive ocular tilt reactions due to unilateral, paramedian, mesodiencephalic lesions. This is in contrast to the only 2 previously reported patients with ocular tilt reactions due to unilateral mesodiencephalic lesions, each of whom had a paroxysmal ipsiversive ocular tilt reaction. This new finding is considered in the context of previous clinical and experimental data on the various types of ocular tilt reactions that follow stimulation or destruction of the peripheral and central vestibular system. Otolithic inputs to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal from the contralateral vestibular nucleus and motor outputs from the interstitial nucleus of Cajal to cervical and ocular motoneurons could be involved in the ocular tilt reaction. We propose that in patients with unilateral meso-diencephalic lesions, a tonic contraversive ocular tilt reaction could be due to persistently decreased resting activity of ipsilateral interstitial nucleus neurons, whereas a paroxysmal ipsiversive ocular tilt reaction could be due to transiently increased activity of the same interstitial nucleus neurons. Cases of ocular tilt reaction due to unilateral meso-diencephalic lesion point to the existence of a crossed graviceptive pathway between the vestibular nucleus and the contralateral interstitial nucleus of Cajal. 
4	Effects of calcium on vascular smooth muscle tone. It is generally acknowledged that calcium plays a major role in the generation of vascular tone. However, in recent years it has become increasingly evident that relatively calcium-insensitive pathways of excitation-contraction coupling also exist in the vascular smooth muscle cell. Possible mechanisms of vascular smooth muscle contraction and their possible role in the pathophysiology of hypertension are reviewed. The rationale for the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of hypertension is discussed. 
1	Postoperative active specific immunization in colorectal cancer patients with virus-modified autologous tumor-cell vaccine. First clinical results with tumor-cell vaccines modified with live but avirulent Newcastle disease virus [published erratum appears in Cancer 1991 Apr 15;67(8):2124] Sixteen patients with colorectal carcinoma Dukes' Stage B2, C, or D were treated with an autologous virus-modified tumor-cell vaccine after potential curative tumor resection (R0-Resection). An inoculum of 1 X 10(7) cells incubated with 32 hemagglutination units of nonirradiated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was given intracutaneously up to four times at 10-day intervals. The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin reaction was measured. The vaccination was well tolerated. In 11 of 16 patients an increasing reactivity against the vaccine was observed during the vaccination procedure. A challenge test using autologous tumor cells without NDV after the vaccination cycle revealed a specific antitumor sensibilization in 12 patients. The DTH response was not due to bacterial contamination or sensibility to the virus. Histologic examination of the vaccination site showed a dense infiltration of predominantly helper T-lymphocytes. We conclude that in most of the patients treated active, specific immunization led to a specific antitumor sensitivity. 
5	Refeeding of infants with acute diarrheal disease. The purpose of this study was to determine which infant formula among five would be the most efficacious for the refeeding of infants during an acute episode of diarrhea. Fifty male infants less than 12 months of age with severe diarrhea and at least 5% dehydration were admitted to a metabolic unit and studied in a prospective, single-blind protocol. Ten infants randomly received one of five types of formula: two-thirds diluted cow milk, cow milk formula (Nanon, Nestle, Inc., Sao Paulo, Brazil), Portagen, Pregestimil, or Prosobee (Mead Johnson & Co. Division, Evansville, Ind.). They continued to receive the same formula for 72 hours unless dehydration occurred. There were no associated infections, and they received no prior antibiotic treatment. Oral hydration together with intravenous fluid therapy was given to all patients during the initial treatment. During the first 72 hours of refeeding, patients fed Portagen excreted the least amount of stool and required reduced quantities of intravenous fluids or oral hydration. In contrast, patients fed diluted cow milk or any other formula had more severe diarrhea. Nine of the 10 patients fed Portagen completed the 72-hour treatment, whereas only 2 of 10 fed diluted cow milk tolerated it. Similarly, the cumulative proportions for high purging rate, dehydration, carbohydrate intolerance, and vomiting were more favorable for Portagen and least acceptable for diluted cow milk. No differences were found among the remaining three formulas tested. These data show that diluted cow milk is poorly tolerated by infants with severe diarrhea, whereas Portagen is more effective. 
5	The use of the Cytobrush cervical sampler in patients with cervical stenosis. In 37 of 43 patients (86%) with cervical stenosis (inability to undergo passage of the cotton-tipped applicator), the Cytobrush cervical sampler was successfully passed into the endocervical canal. The use of the Cytobrush sampler for cervical cytologic screening appears to be valuable in patients with cervical stenosis. 
5	Combined computed tomography and dacryocystography for complex lacrimal problems. Two imaging modalities, computed tomography (CT) and dacryocystography (DCG), were combined to demonstrate the relationships between the lacrimal system and the surrounding soft-tissue structures. In selected cases, such as those involving severe facial trauma, midfacial tumours, significant sinus disease, or previous lacrimal, nasal or sinus surgery, this imaging technique may be useful in better evaluating the anatomy of the lacrimal system and planning a surgical approach. 
5	Postoperative complications after Molteno implant surgery. We performed Molteno implant surgery in one eye each of 41 patients with uncontrolled glaucoma. Intraocular pressure was controlled (intraocular pressure less than or equal to 18 mm Hg) in 32 eyes (78%). The mean preoperative intraocular pressure was 40 +/- 13.2 mm Hg, whereas the mean postoperative intraocular pressure was 16 +/- 6.6 mm Hg. Patients were followed up for an average of 16 months after the operation. Visual acuity was unchanged in 23 eyes (56%), improved in nine eyes (22%), and poorer in nine eyes (22%). The major complications included shallow anterior chamber and hypotony in six eyes (14.6%), vitreous hemorrhage in two eyes (4.9%), retinal detachment in one eye (2.4%), and malignant glaucoma in two eyes (4.9%). Less grave complications included hyphema in four eyes (9.8%), peripheral choroidal effusion in 15 eyes (36.6%), obstruction of the tube in six eyes (14.6%), recession of the tube into the angle in two eyes (4.9%), erosion of the tube in one eye (2.4%), and Tenon's cyst formation in three eyes (7.3%). 
5	Osteomalacia in hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria: a correlative clinical-histomorphometric study. We characterized the bone disease of transilial biopsy specimens from children with hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets with hypercalciuria (HHRH) and genetically related asymptomatic hypercalciuric subjects. All HHRH patients showed irregular mineralization fronts, markedly elevated osteoid surface and seam width, increased number of osteoid lamellae, and prolonged mineralization lag time. These findings are consistent with a mineralization defect and indicate unambiguously that the bone disease in HHRH is osteomalacia. The only abnormality seen in the asymptomatic hypercalciuric subjects was slightly extended osteoid surface. Parametric and nonparametric statistical analyses performed on a pooled sample of HHRH patients and asymptomatic hypercalciuric subjects revealed a very high inverse correlation and a tight linear relationship between serum phosphorus and osteoid parameters. Serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which is low in other forms of hereditary hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia, is elevated in HHRH and correlated positively with osteoid parameters and the mineralization lag time. Serum alkaline phosphatase showed similar relationships. These results as well as the clinical, biochemical, and radiological remission of bone disease consequent to phosphate therapy strongly suggest that in HHRH 1) hypophosphatemia alone is sufficient to cause osteomalacia; and 2) the elevation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D reflects the degree of the primary renal phosphate leak, but is not involved in the pathogenesis of the bone disease. 
4	Arteriovenous malformation of the tongue. Polyvinyl alcohol particles used to embolize an arteriovenous malformation of the tongue were only temporarily successful. Additional embolization therapy was necessary and was complicated by ischemic ulcers of the tongue. We conclude that embolization therapy can be used, but the efficacy of this therapy in the longer term remains to be determined. 
5	Different patterns of gene expression in ras-resistant and ras-sensitive cells. We have shown previously that nontumorigenic NIH 3T3 cells can be made tumorigenic and metastatic by transfection and expression of activated ras, whereas in LTA cells, which are tumorigenic but nonmetastatic, the degree of malignancy is not altered by ras. To investigate possible mechanisms of natural ras resistance, we compared the expression patterns of several genes thought to be involved in ras-induced metastatic progression in LTA (ras-resistant) and NIH 3T3 (ras-sensitive) cells, before and after constitutive expression of transfected T24-H-ras. We examined the expression of the nuclear "early-response" genes jun and fos and the "tumor-suppressor" retinoblastoma (Rb) gene, as well as genes involved in invasion (major excreted protein [MEP], tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases [TIMP]), and cell adhesion (secreted phosphoprotein 1 [SPP1; also known as osteopontin]). We found distinct differences in both the basal and ras-induced levels of expression of most of these genes in LTA versus NIH 3T3 cells. High levels of MEP and low levels of TIMP were induced in ras-transfected NIH 3T3 cells, whereas LTA cells showed intermediate levels of MEP and high levels of TIMP that were only marginally affected by the expression of transfected ras. Similarly, SPP1 expression was strongly induced by ras in NIH 3T3 cells but was repressed by ras in LTA cells. Enzymogram assays for functional gelatinase activity showed an increase in 67-kd and 62-kd bands in NIH 3T3 cells in the presence of ras. LTA cells showed no gelatinolytic activity in the presence or absence of ras. Data from an in vitro assay for chemoinvasiveness showed a pattern as predicted from the expression of invasion-related genes; chemoinvasiveness in ras-transfected NIH 3T3 was greater than in LTA and ras-transfected LTA cells, which was greater than in NIH 3T3 cells. Differences in expression of the genes examined are believed to contribute to the ras responsiveness of NIH 3T3 cells and the ras resistance of LTA cells. 
3	Anisocoria in unilateral ophthalmic disease. Pupillary diameters in the affected and unaffected eyes of 327 patients with uniocular red eye were assessed during fixation of a distant target. The mean pupillary diameters were similar in the unaffected eyes in each of eight diagnostic groups, but were significantly different (F = 3.84, p less than 0.001) in the diseased eyes. With corneal abrasions (p less than 0.001), marginal keratitis (p less than 0.05), and acute anterior uveitis (p less than 0.001) the mean pupillary diameter for the affected eye was significantly smaller than that of the unaffected eye. The observed differences of pupillary diameter probably reflect the role of neuronal and autocoid mechanisms in the unilateral control of pupillary size. 
5	Rectal bleeding. Patient delay in presentation. Patient delay in presentation of rectal bleeding has been identified as a factor in delayed diagnosis among patients with colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to identify demographic or psychological factors, or beliefs or behaviors related to delay in presentation of rectal bleeding. In 93 patients presenting with this symptom to their general practitioner, delay ranged from 0 to 249 days with a median of 7 days; 27 (29 percent) delayed more than 14 days. Delay was unrelated to age, sex, ethnic origin, competence in English, length of schooling, social status, availability of social support, measured psychologic traits, and to the belief that the cause might be cancer. The proportions delaying more than 14 days were statistically significantly elevated among those who were not worried by the bleeding (47 percent delayed); those who did not regularly look at their feces or the toilet paper after use (37 percent); and those who took some other action before presenting to their general practitioner (43 percent). 
5	Slowly progressive aphasia: three cases with language, memory, CT and PET data. Three cases of slowly progressive speech and language disturbance were studied at various points post onset (three, five and 15 years respectively). Language, neuropsychological and brain imaging (computer tomography and positron emission tomography) evaluations were completed on all three patients. The data suggest that the syndrome of "progressive aphasia": 1) does not involve a uniform symptom complex; 2) does not necessarily develop into a full blown dementia syndrome; 3) varies greatly in rate of progression from case to case; 4) is associated with normal brain structure (on computer tomography); and 5) is associated with abnormal left temporal lobe metabolism as measured by fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). One patient had histological findings consistent with Alzheimer's disease at necropsy. 
5	Genotypic analyses of Richter's syndrome. The authors report the immunogenotype of two cases of Richter's syndrome. The immunoglobulin gene rearrangement pattern obtained on Southern Blot analysis was found in both cases to be the same in leukemic blood cells and in the tissue involved by the lymphoma. The beta chain and gamma chain T-cell receptor gene rearrangement pattern exhibited a germ-line configuration in the peripheral blood cells and in the lymph node in Case 2, whereas in Case 1 the lymph node had a gene rearrangement in the beta chain, as well as in the gamma chain T-cell receptor, and the leukemic cells from bone marrow were found to be in a germ-line configuration for T-cell receptors (beta and gamma chains). 
1	Human liver regeneration after major hepatectomy. A study of liver volume by computed tomography. Regeneration of the remnant liver after major hepatectomy in humans was studied by computed axial tomography (CT) in 12 noncirrhotic and five cirrhotic patients. Liver volumes were measured by abdominal CT 3 days, 10 days, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 1.5 years after resection. Of the 17 patients, liver remnant volume was increased in 21.2% +/- 6.7% and 30.6% +/- 12.7% at 3 months and 6 months after resection, respectively. Noncirrhotic livers were 28.4% +/- 9.5% and 48.4% +/- 17.8% larger at 3 and 6 months. For cirrhotic livers, the increase was 8.5% +/- 3.6% and 12.9% +/- 4.5%. In five patients with right hepatectomy (65% resection), the liver remnant volumes were increased 38.4% +/- 11.7%, 48.0% +/- 16.2% and 95.1% +/- 4.5% at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after resection, respectively. In seven patients with right partial hepatectomy (30% to 35% resection), the percentages were 7.4% +/- 3.2%, 21.8% +/- 8.4%, and 63.9% +/- 18.3% and in five patients with left lateral segmentectomy (15% resection), they were 15.6% +/- 8.2%, 27.8% +/- 12.2%, and 33.0% +/- 14.5% 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after resections, respectively. Noncirrhotic livers showed better regeneration than cirrhotic livers. Complete regeneration took about 1 year. The noncirrhotic liver that underwent right lobectomy also needed 1 year to double its postresection volume. 
4	Apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a non-Oriental man. Japanese investigators first described apical HCM in 2.9% of patients who had diagnostic left ventricular catheterization for suspected ischemic heart disease or cardiomyopathy. This entity was initially thought to be limited to individuals of Asian origin and has been uncommonly described in patients of Western origin. Patients of Western origin differ in several ways from those in the original description of Yamaguchi et al, but they both share the same classic criterion of hypertrophy of the left ventricular apex. The major differences probably relate to the anatomic variation in the distribution of the left ventricular hypertrophy as described by Maron et al. It is not known whether racial, genetic, or environmental factors account for the variation of disease expression in Asian and Western patients. Our case illustrates that this diagnosis should be considered in patients who have chest pain (anginal or atypical) and markedly abnormal findings on electrocardiograms in the absence of hypertension or significant coronary artery disease. 
2	Sudden death due to delayed rupture of hepatic subcapsular hematoma following blunt abdominal trauma. Blunt abdominal trauma can cause sudden, unexpected death due to injuries to internal organs. Rupture of a hepatic subcapsular hematoma is a relatively rare cause of sudden death following minor blunt abdominal trauma. Death may be delayed several days to weeks. The autopsy is an invaluable diagnostic tool that can be utilized to uncover sudden deaths due to abdominal trauma. The case of an alcoholic who died of a ruptured hepatic subcapsular hematoma is presented. The death investigation revealed that the victim had sustained blunt abdominal trauma during a fall a few days prior to death. 
4	The automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator in young patients. An international survey identified 40 patients less than 20 years old who underwent surgical implantation of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD). There was a history of aborted sudden cardiac death or sustained ventricular tachycardia in 92.5% of these patients. Twenty-two patients (55%) had structural heart disease; dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were the most common diagnoses. Eighteen patients (45%) had primary electrical abnormalities including seven with the congenital long QT syndrome. There were no perioperative deaths associated with device implantation. Concomitant drug therapy was administered to 75% of the patients. Defibrillator discharge occurred in 70% of the patients, with 17 patients (42.5%) receiving at least one appropriate shock. There were two sudden and two nonsudden deaths at 28.2 months' median follow-up. Sudden death-free survival rates by life table analysis at 12 and 33 months were 0.94 and 0.88, respectively. Total survival rates at 12 and 33 months were 0.94 and 0.82, respectively. The AICD represents an effective treatment approach for young patients with life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. 
4	Mental activity, adrenergic modulation, and cardiac arrhythmias in patients with heart disease. All of the electrophysiological mechanisms of arrhythmias are sensitive to the influences of the autonomic nervous system, particularly to its adrenergic limb. Arrhythmogenic areas may also be dependent on the inhomogeneity of these influences because of their pathophysiological structure and/or the neurogenic or humoral nature of the vector of modulation. The complexity of the various possible scenarios, combined with the role of the rate dependence, explains why standardized protocols exploring the autonomic nervous system in clinical arrhythmias are difficult to define. Invasive electrophysiology is not adapted to address the problem. Isoprenaline infusion only reproduces the humoral adrenergic stimulation to which only a few types of arrhythmias are sensitive. The exercise test is a very complex investigation if the multiple parameters involved are considered. Only a part of its limitations are obviated by the mental stress. Under natural conditions, the neurogenic origin, the intensity of the sympathetic stimulation, and its suddenness are all critical factors responsible for severe tachyarrhythmias. Arrhythmias of the long QT syndrome are particularly demonstrative of the importance of the autonomic nervous system, but this evidence can also be documented in more trivial circumstances of diseased or apparently undiseased hearts. Exploring the autonomic nervous system behavior through heart rate variability in ambulatory recordings is the most recent and fruitful method of investigation. This nonprovocative approach has technical obstacles and practical and theoretical limitations related to the fundamental nature of the autonomic nervous system, which is both a marker of the cardiac status and a determinant of arrhythmias. 
2	Undetected fatal acute pancreatitis: why is the disease so frequently overlooked? An analysis of postmortem investigations between 1980 and 1985 revealed 43 patients with acute pancreatitis. In 13 (30.2%) of them, the diagnosis was first established at autopsy. In eight of the latter patients, the diagnosis could have been present on admission. The etiology was alcoholism in three patients, hypothermia in one, biliary tract disease in one, and unknown in three patients. In five patients, acute pancreatitis developed after gastric, pancreatic, or biliary tract surgery. Abdominal pain was present in only one patient. Amylase levels had been estimated in 11 patients, but the level was in the diagnostic range (greater than or equal to 3 times of upper normal level) in only four. Consequently, ultrasound examination was performed in only two of the latter four patients, but failed to show the pancreas because of intestinal gas. To diagnose acute pancreatitis at an earlier stage and to improve therapy and prognosis, we recommend that serum amylase levels be measured and ultrasound examination be performed. If the results are inconclusive, this should be followed by computed tomography for all abdominal emergency cases and for patients who have undergone cardiopulmonary or upper abdominal surgery, especially when the patients deteriorate or fail to improve postoperatively. 
2	Pathogenesis of ceftriaxone-associated biliary sludge. In vitro studies of calcium-ceftriaxone binding and solubility. Ceftriaxone, a semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin, has recently been associated with biliary sludge formation. Analysis of the biliary concretions induced by this agent shows a calcium salt of ceftriaxone. The present in vitro studies were undertaken to provide insight into the pathogenesis of ceftriaxone-associated biliary sludge formation by evaluating possible interactions that may exist between calcium, bile salts, and ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone possessed high calcium-binding affinity. The formation constant for the calcium ceftriaxone salt at 37 degrees C was about 157.3 L/mol; stoichiometry of the salt was 1:1, i.e., calcium ceftriaxone. The calcium-binding property of ceftriaxone was observed to be additive to that of taurocholate in mixed taurocholate-ceftriaxone solutions. Although the solubility product constant for calcium ceftriaxone was only 1.62 x 10(-6) mol/L2, marked metastability was observed; neither visible nor microscopic precipitates developed until the [Ca2+] x [ceftriaxone] ion product exceeded the solubility product constant by a factor of 10.4. Metastability of the calcium ceftriaxone salt was also observed in human gallbladder bile in vitro. Estimates of human biliary calcium ceftriaxone solubility in vivo were than calculated from previously-reported values for biliary [Ca2+], [ceftriaxone], and from the solubility product constant as defined in this study. Calculated saturation indices for calcium-ceftriaxone in human bile generally increased (corresponding to a decrease in solubility) with increasing ceftriaxone dose. At doses less than or equal to 1 g, saturation index was well within the metastable range of this calcium-salt. However, at doses greater than or equal to 2 g, the saturation index surpassed the metastable limit. Under these conditions, precipitation of ceftriaxone could occur. It was concluded that the development of ceftriaxone-induced biliary sludge is a solubility problem that occurs in patients receiving high-dose treatment (greater than or equal to 2 g). This study proposes that the risk of developing ceftriaxone-associated biliary "pseudolithiasis" increases with increasing ceftriaxone dose and in patients with impaired gallbladder emptying. 
1	A cohort study of fat intake and risk of breast cancer. Between 1982 and 1987, 519 newly incident, histologically confirmed cases of breast cancer were identified in a cohort of 56,837 women enrolled in the Canadian National Breast Screening Study. These women had completed a dietary questionnaire before the occurrence of their breast cancer, and this has been used to estimate their intake of dietary fat and several other nutrients. There is evidence of a positive association between breast cancer and total fat intake, with a relative risk of 1.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.82) per 77 g per day, and some evidence of a dose-response relationship (P = .052). 
4	Left ventricular remodeling after acute myocardial infarction: clinical course and beneficial effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition. LV enlargement is an important determinant of survival after AMI. Pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to LV dilatation after an AMI include early thinning and stretching of the infarcted segment (e.g., infarct expansion) and hypertrophy of the noninfarcted myocardium. Such LV dilatation may adversely affect subsequent cardiac function, leading to heart failure and death. Experimental data in animals and preliminary studies in humans have demonstrated that early administration of captopril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, may limit infarct expansion and will attenuate progressive LV dilatation. This article discussed the clinical importance of the dilated left ventricle and reviewed advances and ongoing research in the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in the chronic phase after AMI. 
2	Advantages of a narrow-range, medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch for volume maintenance in a porcine model of fecal peritonitis OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of two hydroxyethyl starch solutions of different molecular weight ranges for volume maintenance in a porcine model of fecal peritonitis. DESIGN: Randomized prospective trial. SETTING: Laboratory investigation. SUBJECTS: Adolescent female pigs weighing approximately 30 kg. INTERVENTIONS: We compared diafiltered 6% pentastarch with 6% high molecular weight hetastarch for volume maintenance in a porcine model of fecal peritonitis. The number average molecular weight of pentastarch is higher than hetastarch, although the weight average molecular weight is lower, i.e., a narrow range of medium weight molecules. The infusion rate of each agent was adjusted to maintain baseline arterial Hct for less than or equal to 7 hr after instrumentation and induction of fecal peritonitis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: The volume of fluid required to maintain arterial Hct was compared along with comparisons of hemodynamic and histologic responses associated with the two agents. RESULTS: Significantly less pentastarch was required to prevent hemoconcentration than hetastarch (109 +/- 22.8 vs. 150 +/- 10.3 mL/kg; p less than .05) while hemodynamics, colloid osmotic pressure, and oxygen transport responses were similar. Capillary patency was greater (21.99 +/- 3.68 vs. 10.09 +/- 1.17%; p less than .05) and mean alveolar capillary barrier thickness was less (2.36 +/- 0.13 vs. 3.06 +/- 0.17 microns; p less than .05) with pentastarch than with hetastarch, as judged by electron microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that pentastarch is better retained in the circulation in capillary leak syndromes compared with hetastarch. 
4	Effect of high-dose furosemide in refractory congestive heart failure. High-dose firosemide is considered effective in primary renal sodium retention but is not generally recommended in congestive heart failure. In order to evaluate efficacy and safety of high-dose furosemide (greater than 500 mg/day), the authors studied 20 patients (pts) resistant to therapy (including furosemide less than 500 mg/day) selected from 161 pts admitted for chronic heart failure. All refractory pts (15 men and 5 women, mean age sixty +/- 12 years) were in NYHA class IV and showed hyponatremia (130 +/- 5 mEq/L) and impaired renal function (BUN 31 +/- 14 mg/dL, serum creatinine 1.3 +/- 0.3 mg/dL and BUN/creatinine ratio 23 +/- 7). In addition to digitalis, dopamine, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or vasodilators, IV high-dose furosemide (775 +/- 419 mg/day, 500-2000) was given for ten +/- five days under daily clinical and laboratory monitoring. Three pts died of low-output syndrome while 16 pts were upgraded to NYHA class III and 1 pt to class II; a mean weight reduction of 7.3 +/- 2.9 kg in ten + five days (0.80 +/- 0.4 kg/day) and a mean diuresis increase of 88 +/- 57% occurred. The maximal dose of furosemide did not correlate with serum creatinine but did correlate with BUN/creatinine ratio (r = 0.78, p less than .001). Pts were discharged on with chronic heart failure, and 43% in the subgroup in NYHA class IV with hyponatremia. High dose furosemide was effective for rapid removal of excess water and salt in "furosemide-resistant" congestive heart failure. The relationship between renal impairment and maximal furosemide doses seems to confirm the role of renal pharmacokinetics in the appearance of furosemide resistance. 
4	Is obesity-related hypertension less of a cardiovascular risk? The Framingham Study. The hypothesis that obesity-related hypertension is relatively innocuous was explored by an examination of cardiovascular events over 34 years of follow-up when related to biennially measured weights and blood pressures using time-dependent covariate proportional hazards analysis. The 5209 participants were also classified by age, cigarette smoking, and antihypertensive treatment at each of four baseline examinations with 8-year follow-up periods. Over the period of follow-up, there were 978 cardiovascular events in men and 836 in women. Risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in general and of CHD in particular was as strongly related to hypertension at all levels of body mass index. This was also found to apply when adjustment was made for possible confounding by cigarette smoking. Age and smoking-adjusted absolute risks of cardiovascular events were found to be higher in hypertensive individuals with high than with low BMIs. Furthermore, the relative risk of cardiovascular disease did not vary significantly with BMI. Thus hypertension is at least as dangerous in obese as in lean persons at all ages in either sex, providing no support for the hypothesis that hypertension in the obese is more benign. This is important, since obesity predisposes to hypertension and most who have hypertension are obese. This report examines the hypothesis for CVD outcomes considered by previous reports and also the subcategories of CVD disease such as myocardial infarction and stroke, and includes data on both men and women and on young and old. 
1	Significance of blasts in low-cell-count cerebrospinal fluid specimens from children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the presence of more than 5% blasts in a differential count of cytocentrifuged cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with less than 6 leukocytes/microliter was predictive of central nervous system (CNS) relapse in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A double concentrate method of cytocentrifuge preparation was used to analyze 4543 consecutive CSF specimens from 349 children with ALL between January 1, 1982, and September 30, 1988. One hundred nine CSF specimens from 58 evaluable children had less than 6 leukocytes/microliter and more than 5% blasts on cytocentrifuge differential count (low-cell-count specimen with blasts [LCB]). During the study period, 25 of 332 evaluable children (7.5%) had CNS leukemic recurrence. In 22 of 25 (88%), the CNS relapse was preceded by at least one abnormal low-cell-count CSF specimen. One of 34 patients with a single LCB at diagnosis (3%) had subsequent CNS relapse compared with five of eight patients (62.5%) with a single LCB during remission (P = 0.0002). Of 16 children with two or more LCB during remission, nine (56%) had CNS relapse defined by standard criteria, whereas six additional patients in this group were declared to be in CNS relapse on the basis of their repetitive LCB. Whether diagnosing CNS recurrence earlier in its course based on a modification of the definition of CNS leukemia will change the frequency of subsequent adverse events or make possible decreased intensity of CNS retreatment remains to be determined. 
5	The role of infection in the morbidity and mortality of patients with head and neck cancer undergoing multimodality therapy. Cancer of the head and neck is a common cancer worldwide. The majority of patients present with locally advanced disease. Recently a great deal of improvement has been made in multimodality therapy of this disease, warranting more careful consideration of factors affecting quality of life, disease course, and treatment. Infection is clearly a factor. Analysis of 662 hospital admissions of 169 head and neck cancer patients was performed. A definite infection was documented in 86 febrile episodes, pneumonia contributed to 40%, bacteremia to 13%, skin and soft tissue infection to 12%, and tracheobronchitis to 10%. Among the evaluated risk factors, foreign bodies, specifically intravenous (IV) cannulae and gastrostomy tubes, race, performance status, alcohol intake, and nutritional status were statistically significant variables that predicted for or were associated with infection. Infection contributed to 44% of the deaths. 
4	Exercise intolerance in patients with heart failure and preserved left ventricular systolic function: failure of the Frank-Starling mechanism Invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed in 7 patients who presented with congestive heart failure, normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no significant coronary or valvular heart disease and in 10 age-matched normal subjects. Compared with the normal subjects, patients demonstrates severe exercise intolerance with a 48% reduction in peak oxygen consumption (11.6 +/- 4.0 versus 22.7 +/- 6.1 ml/kg per min; p less than 0.001), primarily due to a 41% reduction in peak cardiac index (4.2 +/- 1.4 versus 7.1 +/- 1.1 liters/min per m2; p less than 0.001). In patients compared with normal subjects, peak left ventricular stroke volume index (34 +/- 9 versus 46 +/- 7 ml/min per m2; p less than 0.01) and end-diastolic volume index (56 +/- 14 versus 68 +/- 12 ml/min per m2; p less than 0.08) were reduced, whereas peak ejection fraction and end-systolic volume index were not different. In patients, the change in end-diastolic volume index during exercise correlated strongly with the change in stroke volume index (r = 0.97; p less than 0.0001) and cardiac index (r = 0.80; p less than 0.03). Pulmonary wedge pressure was markedly increased at peak exercise in patients compared with normal subjects (25.7 +/- 9.1 versus 7.1 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.0001). Patients demonstrated a shift of the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure-volume relation upward and to the left at rest. Increases in left ventricular filling pressure during exercise were not accompanied by increases in end-diastolic volume, indicating a limitation to left ventricular filling. 
5	Obliterative bronchiolitis: virus induced? This report describes a 28-year-old patient with an acute onset of respiratory symptoms associated with clinical and roentgenographic features of an interstitial lung disease which proved fatal. The entity of bronchiolitis obliterans, which was diagnosed on transbronchial biopsy, is discussed, with particular emphasis on the postinfectious type. 
5	Sudden death associated with undiagnosed Graves' disease. Hyperthyroidism may result in multiple symptoms attributable to an excess of thyroid hormone. We report a case of Graves' disease in association with sudden death in a previously healthy, undiagnosed young female. This case illustrates an unusual initial presentation of Graves' disease. 
4	Diagnostic significance of flow separation within the carotid bifurcation demonstrated by digital subtraction angiography. The presence of an area of reversed blood flow due to flow separation in the interval carotid artery is a normal finding in Doppler ultrasound studies in vivo as well as in model carotid bifurcations. This flow separation phenomenon is caused by the geometry of the carotid bifurcation and the fluid dynamics of blood. We demonstrated the flow separation phenomenon on lateral-projection intra-arterial digital subtraction angiograms in 99 of 100 carotid bifurcations. The mean duration of flow separation was 5.8 seconds, with values up to 14 seconds in normal carotid bifurcations. The presence of this flow separation phenomenon is almost independent of atherosclerotic lesions and is not correlated with cerebral ischemia. Therefore, the angiographic finding of a flow separation has no diagnostic value. However, our results refer to a factor that may be important in the genesis of atherosclerosis at the carotid bifurcation, namely the duration of the stay of blood and its components within the area of flow separation. 
5	Inflammatory pseudotumor of intra-abdominal lymph nodes manifesting as recurrent fever of unknown origin: a case report. A 27-year-old man presented with a 7-month history of debilitating recurrent fever and weight loss. Extensive clinical evaluation led to the discovery of splenomegaly and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent splenectomy as well as liver and lymph node biopsy. Histologic examination of the lymph nodes, but not the liver and spleen, revealed inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes. The patient has remained asymptomatic for more than 3 years following the surgical procedure despite the absence of further intervention. Inflammatory pseudotumor of lymph nodes should be considered in the differential evaluation of prolonged or relapsing fever of unknown etiology. 
1	A6--a new 45RO monoclonal antibody for immunostaining of paraffin-embedded tissues. The authors report on the extensive characterization, on normal and pathologic tissues, of the T-cell-specific monoclonal antibody (MoAb) A6, which the authors previously found to identify a fixation- and paraffin-embedding-resistant epitope. A6 reacted with most T lymphocytes, macrophages, and Langerhans' cells of normal tissues and with peripheral T-cell lymphomas (31 of 34), Ki-1+ lymphomas (12 of 18), and T-cell leukemias (1 of 5). All cases of X and non-X histiocytosis examined and monocytic leukemias with mature phenotype only were A6 positive. Three of 47 cases of B-cell lymphoma and leukemia were labeled. Hairy cell leukemias, multiple myelomas, and Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells were negative. The A6 reactivity was preserved with different fixatives (formalin, Bouin's fluid, Carnoy's fixative, and B5) and decalcification procedures and was slightly enhanced by trypsin digestion. The pattern of reactivity of A6 was similar to that obtained with MoAb UCHL-1, recognizing the CD45RO determinant of leukocyte common antigen; however, in pathologic tissues, A6 labeled a higher percentage of cells than UCHL-1. Cross-blocking and enzyme digestion studies (Pronase E [Sigma Chemical, St. Louis, MO] and neuraminidase [Sigma Chemical]) indicated that the two MoAbs may identify close epitopes on the same molecule. In conclusion, the authors' study indicates that A6 is an excellent reagent for detection of the CD45RO molecule on paraffin-embedded normal and pathologic tissues. 
3	Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia associated with a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia is characterized by the presence of spasms of the orbicularis oculi (blepharospasm) and of the lower facial or oromandibular muscles. A patient with this syndrome is presented in which a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma appeared to act as a triggering mechanism for the development of this disorder. On the basis of this report, we recommend that physicians search for this tumor in patients with this disorder. 
3	Drug induced refractory headache--clinical features and management. Two hundred patients who were taking daily symptomatic or immediate relief medications, often in excessive quantities, yet suffering from daily or near daily severe headaches were studied. One hundred and sixteen (58%) of them were also taking concomitant prophylactic medications and they were ineffective. Low tyramine, low caffeine dietary instructions and biofeedback training were given to all patients. The effect of continuing symptomatic medications, discontinuing symptomatic medications, and adding or changing prophylactic medications were studied in the various treatment groups. It is concluded that; 1.) Daily use of symptomatic or immediate relief medications result in chronic daily headache. 2.) Discontinuing daily symptomatic medications itself result in improvement of headache. 3.) Concomitant use of symptomatic medications nullifies the effect of prophylactic medications. 4.) Discontinuing daily symptomatic medications enhances the beneficial effect of prophylactic medications. 
2	Oral indomethacin for acute renal colic. A number of studies have suggested that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents can relieve renal colic by a mechanism of action different from that of narcotics, offering the potential advantage of avoiding narcotic side-effects such as alteration of mental status. The authors prospectively administered oral indomethacin, 50 mg, to 25 nonvomiting patients with acute renal colic due to a documented stone. Eleven patients group (I) received the drug in an unblinded, nonrandomized fashion after failure of oral or parenteral narcotics to provide satisfactory pain relief, either at home or in the emergency department. In 14 additional patients group (II) indomethacin was given as the only initial treatment. Pain intensity before and after treatment was reported using a 1-to-10 scale. In group I, pain decreased from 5.8 +/- 2.7 to 3.6 +/- 3.8 (P less than .02). Six of the 11 patients reported a decrease in pain intensity of 50% or more, which occurred within 25 +/- 11 minutes, and in 5 of these 6, pain decreased to a 0 or 1 level. In group II, pain decreased from 7.6 +/- 1.5 to 4.6 +/- 4.0 (P less than .008). Eight of the 14 patients reported a decrease in pain intensity of 50% or more, which occurred within 40 +/- 14 minutes, and in 5 of these 8 pain decreased to a 0 or 1 level. Among all 25 patients who received indomethacin, pain relief was not significantly associated with the duration of pain before treatment or with patient age or sex. There was a trend for pretreatment pain intensity to be higher among nonresponders (P = .07). 
3	Factors predicting satisfactory home care after stroke. This study prospectively investigated factors predicting optimal poststroke home care. One hundred and thirty-five first occurrence stroke patients and their primary support persons were evaluated during the initial hospitalization after stroke and again one year poststroke. Discriminant function analysis was used to identify two groups from the baseline data: home care situations which were rated optimal and those which were not. Group membership was predicted and validated with 72.6% accuracy. Patients at risk for less than optimal home care had caregivers who were (1) more likely to be depressed, (2) less likely to be married to the patient, (3) below average in knowledge about stroke care, and (4) reporting more family dysfunction. Our findings suggest that caregiver-related problems can have a collective effect on rehabilitation outcome and that treatment should reduce caregiver depression, minimize family dysfunction, and increase the family's knowledge about stroke care. 
4	Sodium sensitive and sodium retaining hypertension. The differences between sodium sensitive and sodium retaining hypertension were theoretically considered using a water tank model of body fluid volume-blood pressure regulation. If an outlet valve is attached to a tank with a base area corresponding to the reciprocal of total peripheral resistance (TPR) and water is poured into this tank at a rate corresponding to the amount of Na+ intake, then equilibrium should be achieved at a certain water level, volume and output from the outlet, which represent mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output (CO) and urinary Na+ excretion. The height of the outlet from the tank bottom and the size cross-sectional area, of the outlet correspond to the x-intercept and slope of the renal function (pressure-natriuresis) curve, respectively. In both nonsodium sensitive hypertension, due to the shift of the curve toward a higher blood pressure level (elevated height of the outlet) without change in the slope (size of the outlet), and sodium sensitive hypertension, due to the depressed slope of the curve (reduced outlet size), not only MAP (water level) but also CO (water volume) are increased, resulting in sodium retaining hypertension, if TPR (reciprocal of base area) remained unchanged, while CO is relatively unchanged, resulting in nonsodium retaining hypertension, if TPR is elevated. Thus, the MAP and its sensitivity to sodium intake is determined by the renal function curve. Since body fluid volume is determined by both the renal function curve and TPR, however, changes in TPR during the development of hypertension is a major factor in determining whether or not the body fluid volume has to change only a small amount or a large amount. Therefore, the sodium sensitivity of blood pressure and sodium retention must be considered separately. 
2	Pancreatic pseudocyst in the left hepatic lobe: a report of two cases. The ultrasound and computed tomographic imaging features in a rare pancreatic pseudocyst of the liver are described in two patients. The pseudocysts occurred in the left lobe in both cases, one after a traumatic injury and the other after alcoholic pancreatitis. The possible topographical sequences with which pancreatic secretions entered the left hepatic lobe to form a cyst are discussed. 
1	Indium-111-antimyosin scintigraphy after doxorubicin therapy in patients with advanced breast cancer Indium-111-antimyosin (111In-antimyosin) scans were performed in 20 women with advanced breast cancer after 10 cycles of chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin (total cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 500 mg/m2). Antimyosin uptake in the myocardium was quantified by means of a heart-to-lung ratio (HLR). Antimyosin uptake in the myocardium was observed in 17/20 (85%) patients, and HLR after chemotherapy was 1.86 +/- 0.25. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) was determined before and after chemotherapy. Patients with decreased EF (8/20, 40%) presented with more intense antimyosin uptake (HLR of 2.11 +/- 0.10 versus 1.70 +/- 0.16 (p = 0.01]. HLR values correlated with EF values after chemotherapy (r = -0.47, p less than 0.05). Positive antimyosin studies after chemotherapy including doxorubicin, indicate the presence of myocardial damage in these patients. Antimyosin studies are a sensitive method to detect myocyte damage in patients after doxorubicin therapy. 
4	An outpatient anticoagulation protocol managed by a vascular nurse-clinician. Lifetime anticoagulation has become a therapeutic option for surgical patients with hypercoagulable states or prosthetic arterial bypass grafts. However, physicians may not achieve optimal anticoagulation or may attempt to limit the length of the therapy period because of the perceived morbidity from hemorrhagic complications of Coumadin therapy. A protocol for anticoagulant therapy monitored and regulated by a vascular nurse-clinician was reviewed. Coumadin was prescribed for 1,891 patient-months to 93 patients to maintain their prothrombin time 1.5 to 2 times control (range: 18 to 24 seconds). The mean (+/- SD) prothrombin time for the study population was 19.8 +/- 1.8 seconds. During follow-up, 472 (14%) of 3,479 prothrombin times measured were below the therapeutic range (n = 232) or prolonged (n = 240), prompting an adjustment in the Coumadin dose in 82 (88%) patients. Four patients developed recurrent vascular graft thrombosis while receiving anticoagulation. There were 6 major and 11 minor hemorrhagic complications. Patients with a chronic risk for arterial or venous thrombosis can have out-patient anticoagulant therapy administered at optimal intensity and regulated safely with a low incidence of hemorrhagic and thrombotic events. 
1	Blood transfusion and recurrence of colorectal cancer: the role of platelet derived growth factors. Efforts to explain the possible effects of blood transfusion on the recurrence of colorectal cancer have been based entirely on the immunosuppressive effects of blood transfusion. However, the relationship between solid tumour development and the immune system is inconclusive. We have investigated an alternative mechanism involving the potential role of growth factors in this phenomenon. Using a human fibroblast: [125I]deoxyuridine uptake mitogenesis assay, the relative amounts of growth factor in the plasma of stored blood were measured. There was a progressive increase in mitogenesis from day 0 (n = 6) to day 28 (n = 6; P less than 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The effect of growth factors on the development of liver and intraperitoneal metastases was studied in Hooded Lister rats. Following an intraportal injection of 10(5) MC28 tumour cells, the experimental group (n = 25) received 2 ml of syngeneic serum intravenously for 4 days. Likewise, colonic anastomoses were performed on omentectomized rats and the peritoneal cavity seeded with 10(3) cells. The experimental groups (n = 20) received either 2 ml serum intravenously repeatedly or 3 ml serum intraperitoneally (n = 19). There was no significant increase in liver metastases or peritoneal disease following intravenous infusion of serum but serum delivered intraperitoneally resulted in a significant increase in tumour from 22 per cent in the controls to 89 per cent in the study group (P less than 0.01). Growth factors released from platelets following blood loss into the peritoneal cavity may be important in enhancing local recurrence of colorectal cancer. 
5	Hypoxia induces a specific set of stress proteins in cultured endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial cells (EC) are the initial cells within the vascular wall exposed to decreases in blood ambient oxygen concentration. The mechanisms by which they tolerate low levels of oxygen are unknown, but may parallel the response to other cellular stresses, such as heat shock. After 4-8 h of hypoxia, we found a decrease in total protein synthesis in both cultured bovine aortic and pulmonary arterial EC. SDS-PAGE and autoradiographic analysis of [35S]methionine-labeled proteins demonstrated the concomitant induction of a specific set of proteins (Mr 34, 36, 47, and 56 kD) in both cell types. These hypoxia-associated proteins (HAPs) were cell-associated and up-regulated in a time- and oxygen concentration-dependent manner. Comparison of these proteins with heat shock proteins (HSPs) demonstrated that HAPs were distinct from HSPs. EC maintained chronically in 3% O2 continued to synthesize elevated levels of HAPs, yet further up-regulated these proteins when exposed to 0% O2. The presence of five times the normal media glucose concentration did not alter the appearance of HAPs. Hypoxia sensitive renal tubular epithelial cells up-regulated no proteins corresponding to HAPs and were irreversibly damaged within 8 h of exposure to 0% O2. In vitro translation experiments demonstrated that the steady-state level of several mRNAs was higher in the anoxic EC than in normoxic EC and encoded for proteins of Mr 32, 35, 37, 40, and 48 kD that were different from proteins encoded by HSP mRNAs. The induction of HAPs during acute hypoxia and their continued synthesis in chronic hypoxia suggest that HAPs may be important in the maintenance of endothelial cell integrity under conditions of decreased ambient oxygen. 
5	Surgical epicardial ablation of left ventricular pathway using sling exposure We report our experience with 43 consecutive patients with left free wall pathways operated on since December 1988 using a modified direct epicardial approach through a medial sternotomy, without the adjunct of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. The left atrioventricular sulcus is exposed by dislocating the heart cephalad and to the right using a sling made of a large sponge passed around the ventricle through the transverse sinus. While the arterial pressure is monitored, the heart is positioned to obtain adequate exposure without compromising the ventricular function. The left atrioventricular junction is exposed using a direct approach. The epicardium is incised along the ventricular edge and a plane of dissection is identified and opened using blunt dissection over the ventricular wall. The entire left atrioventricular junction can be exposed. After dissection, electrophysiological testing is repeated to assess accessory pathway conduction. Epicardial cryoablation was used when accessory pathway conduction was not present (42 patients). Transmural cryoablation was used under normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass when accessory pathway conduction persisted after dissection (subendocardial pathway). In all, cardiopulmonary bypass was not used in 41 patients. There was one early relapse that required transmural cryoablation. There were no complications. 
2	Extrauterine findings of ectopic pregnancy of transvaginal US: importance of echogenic fluid. Transvaginal ultrasound (US) studies of 232 consecutive patients with positive serum pregnancy tests who were considered to be at risk for ectopic pregnancy were prospectively evaluated to determine the significance of various extrauterine findings, including echogenic fluid in the cul-de-sac. All patients were found to have a surgically proved ectopic gestation (group 1, 68 patients [29.3%]), reliable evidence of intrauterine pregnancy at initial transvaginal US (group 2, 83 patients [35.8%]), or no evidence of pregnancy at initial transvaginal US, but subsequent proof of an intrauterine pregnancy (group 3, 81 patients [34.9%]). Adnexal findings were demonstrated in 45 (66%) group 1 patients, including a living extrauterine embryo in 10 (15%), an extrauterine gestational sac in 21 (31%), and an adnexal mass in 14 (21%). Intraperitoneal fluid was detected in 43 (63%) group 1 patients and in 81 (31%) group 3 patients. Echogenic fluid was the only abnormal finding at US in 10 (15%) group 1 patients and added confidence to the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy in many others. Echogenic fluid correlated with hemoperitoneum at the time of surgery. The presence of echogenic fluid indicates a high risk for ectopic pregnancy in women referred with this clinical indication. 
5	Microscopic Wegener's disease: a particular form of Wegener's granulomatosis. We describe a case of Wegener's granulomatosis in which the disease was manifested with crescentic glomerulonephritis, upper airway ulcerations, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with consumptive coagulopathy. No granuloma was identified but antibodies to cytoplasmic components of neutrophils were strongly positive with a diffuse pattern. Because microscopic vessels were predominantly involved (capillaritis), and granuloma were absent, were refer to this particular form of the disease as "microscopic Wegener's disease.". 
4	Effect of a leukocyte-platelet removal filter on ischemia induced reperfusion injury. The effect of leukocyte and platelet depletion on reperfusion injury using a leukocyte-platelet removal filter (LRF) in intracoronary thrombolysis is reported. To better define the usefulness of LRF in evaluating the effectiveness of intracoronary thrombolysis with this device, several cardiovascular variables were examined in rabbits during ischemia followed by reperfusion. The rabbits underwent cytoapheresis with LRF (n = 5) and were compared with controls without LRF (n = 5). LRF was composed of a nonwoven polyester fabric (1.8 microns, 4.6 gm). Removal of leukocytes and platelets by LRF was 98% for both. A period of 30 min equilibration was allowed before any experimental intervention, at which time the diagonal artery was occluded for 20 min and then reperfused. All arrhythmias were defined and quantified in accordance with the Lambeth Convention. Regional wall thickening was examined by a pulsed Doppler dimension system. No significant differences were observed in hemodynamic variables between the two groups; however, rabbits treated with a LRF demonstrated greater regional wall thickening (LRF group: 17 +/- 0.9%, control group: 11 +/- 0.3%, p less than 0.01), as well as significant improvement in the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias (LRF group: 12.5%, control group: 47.2%, p less than 0.01). The data suggest that LRF may help prevent arrhythmias, and preserve left ventricular contraction, during and after intracoronary thrombolysis. 
5	Serum amylase in patients with renal insufficiency and renal failure. Results vary with regard to the upper limits of serum amylase seen in patients with renal failure, and very little has been reported with patients with renal insufficiency not yet requiring dialysis. To determine the level of serum amylase elevation in renal insufficiency and renal failure, we determined serum amylase values in 128 subjects with creatinine clearances less than 90 ml/min. Serum amylase remained in the normal range when creatinine clearance was greater than 50 ml/min, and did not become elevated until creatinine clearance was less than 50 ml/min. The highest serum amylase recorded in the absence of acute pancreatitis was 503 IU/L (normal, less than 128 IU/L). Serum lipase and trypsin values paralleled those for serum amylase; values remained normal when creatinine clearance was greater than 50 ml/min, and were normal or elevated when creatinine clearance was less than 50 ml/min. These results indicate that elevations of serum amylase (i.e., amylase greater than 128 but less than 500 IU/L) in asymptomatic patients with impaired renal function are not evident until creatinine clearances fall below 50 ml/min, and probably do not represent acute pancreatitis. 
5	Reversible myopathy due to labetalol. A severe, generalized myopathy developed in 2 children treated with labetalol. An 11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy demonstrated proximal weakness and markedly elevated creatine kinase levels during labetalol therapy. Clinical improvement began immediately when labetalol administration was halted; muscle strength was normal within 2 months. Muscle biopsies were consistent with rhabdomyolysis. 
4	Vena caval flow: assessment with cine MR velocity mapping. The authors used cine magnetic resonance (MR) velocity mapping to study flow in the superior vena cava (SVC) and inferior vena cava (IVC) of 13 healthy control subjects and 13 patients with right-sided cardiac disease. In the control subjects, peaks of flow in systole and diastole were observed, and mean SVC flow was 35% of the cardiac output. Respiratory gating was used in six control subjects to acquire images at end inspiration and end expiration, and although the systolic peak was reduced at end expiration, total flow was unchanged. A reduced systolic peak and retrograde flow in the IVC were observed in patients with tricuspid regurgitation. A reduced diastolic peak was seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension, pericardial constriction, and right ventricular dysplasia, reflecting reduced diastolic compliance of the right ventricle. In the patient with obstruction of the SVC, absence of flow was confirmed, and retrograde flow was seen in the azygos vein. The authors believe that cine MR velocity mapping is a reliable method of studying vena caval flow noninvasively and that it has important potential applications for the investigation of disorders of the right side of the heart. 
1	Bone sarcomas as second malignant neoplasms following childhood cancer. This study explores the relationship between histologic variants of bone sarcomas and previous therapy in patients in whom an unrelated malignant neoplasm had been diagnosed during childhood. Sarcomas of bone were the most common second malignant neoplasm (SMN) reported to the Late Effects Study Group, a 13-institution consortium consisting of pediatric oncology centers from western Europe, Canada, and the United States. The authors attempted to relate the histologic subtypes of the 91 bone tumors to clinical factors such as previous therapy and genetic predisposition because morphologic variants have been shown to have biologic significance in other tumors and may have etiologic import. The literature concerning the subtypes of bone tumors, clinical and experimental, is also reviewed. The authors also investigated the effect of several factors on the time interval from the first diagnosis to the SMN (i.e., the bone sarcoma). Anthracyclines significantly shortened the interval by about 3 years. The primary diagnosis also significantly affected the interval, with leukemia/lymphomas having the shortest interval and retinoblastoma the longest. The authors could not demonstrate any significant relationship between morphologic characteristics of the osteosarcoma and predisposing conditions. However, lesions diagnosed as chondrosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma occurred almost exclusively in patients who had received radiation therapy to the site in which the SMN developed. 
1	Variations on the temporoparietal fascial flap. An improved understanding of the vascular supply of the layers of the temporal fossa has increased the potential of this region for new and ingenious reconstructive techniques. Separate and independently vascularized layers of this region include hair-bearing scalp, glabrous skin, tempororoparietal fascia (and galea aponeurotica), temporalis muscle and fascia, and pericranium. Island flaps of glabrous skin and scalp provided esthetically appropriate tissue to cover a variety of defects. The malleable bulk of the subcutaneous fascial layers were combined with skin grafts to restore thin lining, and used as a vascularized bed for cartilage grafts in otherwise unsatisfactory recipient sites. Illustrative cases from our 5-year clinical experience are presented to demonstrate various combinations of the temporoparietal fascial pedicle with tissues from the temporal region to reconstruct the eyebrows, eyelids, orbits, cheeks, and lips. 
5	Timing of operation for aortic regurgitation: relation to postoperative contractile state. With angiography and pressure measurement, we determined left ventricular volume, wall stress, and systolic performance in 30 patients with aortic regurgitation before and after successful aortic valve replacement. End-systolic wall stress was greatly elevated preoperatively and decreased to normal postoperatively. Systolic pump performance assessed as ejection phase indexes was severely depressed preoperatively and improved to normal or near-normal postoperatively in most patients. The ratio of end-systolic wall stress to end-systolic volume index (ESS/ESVI), an index of myocardial contractility, was greatly decreased before operation. Postoperatively, the ratio increased in all patients, becoming normal in 12 of the 13 patients who had a preoperative ESS/ESVI of 2.9 or greater. However, 15 of 17 patients in whom the ESS/ESVI ratio was less than 2.9 still had subnormal ratios, which indicates the presence of irreversible contractile dysfunction. Stepwise multivariate analysis showed that preoperative ESS/ESVI was the only independent discriminator of postoperative normalization of the contractile function as assessed by ESS/ESVI. After aortic valve replacement, myocardial contractile state does not return to normal in a considerable number of patients. It is important to offer aortic valve replacement for aortic regurgitation before the chance for a good functional result is lost. The ESS/ESVI ratio may be a useful index in determining the timing of operation in patients with aortic regurgitation. 
3	Hemiparkinsonism as a complication of an Ommaya reservoir. Case report. The authors describe the case of a 28-year-old woman who developed the following symptoms in her right hand: a lasting resting tremor, transient focal rigidity, and paresthesia. These deficits occurred following treatment with intrathecal methotrexate via an Ommaya reservoir which was placed too deeply, resulting in trauma to the contralateral mesencephalon. 
4	Lack of prognostic value of syncope in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome Syncope in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome may be considered a premonitory event heralding the future development of sudden death. Therefore, the clinical and electrophysiologic data of 101 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome referred for invasive evaluation of known arrhythmias were reviewed to assess the incidence and clinical relevance of syncope. Thirty-six patients reported the occurrence of one or more syncopal episodes (group 1) and 65 patients had no syncope (group 2). These two groups did not differ significantly with regard to age, gender, incidence and characteristics of arrhythmia, clinical history, frequency of arrhythmic events and presence of associated cardiac disease. There were 10 patients in group 1 and 12 in group 2 who had ventricular fibrillation. There were no statistical differences between the two groups with respect to the effective refractory period of the right atrium, atrioventricular node, accessory pathway and right ventricle. Furthermore, no differences between the two groups were noted with respect to cycle length of circus movement tachycardia, mean heart rate during atrial fibrillation, and minimum RR interval during atrial fibrillation. In addition, the accessory pathway location was not significantly different between group 1 and group 2. The occurrence of syncope could not be predicted from any electrophysiologic finding and this symptom had a low sensitivity and specificity for recognition of dangerous rapid heart rates. Furthermore, the prognostic value of syncope was less accurate and predictive than the shortest RR interval during atrial fibrillation and the anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway for aborted sudden death occurrence. 
4	Giant cell versus lymphocytic myocarditis. A comparison of their clinical features and long-term outcomes BACKGROUND. Giant cell myocarditis has rarely been diagnosed premortem, and little is known about its natural history. In addition, no comparative studies with lymphocytic myocarditis exist. METHODS AND RESULTS. The clinical features, serial change in left ventricular fraction (LVEF), and outcomes of all patients with histologically verified myocarditis were retrospectively evaluated. Ten patients (22%) were found to have giant cell myocarditis (group 1), whereas the remaining 36 (78%) had lymphocytic myocarditis (group 2). Age at presentation, gender distribution, duration of symptoms, initial LVEF, and resting hemodynamics did not differ between groups. Ventricular tachycardia was detected in 90% of group 1 patients compared with only 25% of group 2 (p = 0.0007). Atrioventricular block that required pacemaker insertion was also more common in group 1 (60%) than in group 2 (8.3%) (p = 0.001). Left ventricular systolic function declined during follow-up in group 1 patients (LVEF, 0.43 +/- 0.07-0.26 +/- 0.05, p = 0.11) but increased in group 2 patients (LVEF, 0.33 +/- 0.03-0.41 +/- 0.03, p = 0.02). When the net change between initial and final LVEF was assessed, a significant difference was evident (giant cell group, -0.17 +/- 0.06; lymphocytic group, +0.07 +/- 0.03; p = 0.0008). Although a greater proportion of patients in group 1 died or required transplantation (seven of 10 versus 11 of 36, p = 0.03), actuarial survival over 4 years was not different for the giant cell group (50%) than for the lymphocytic group (62%). CONCLUSION. Giant cell myocarditis was more prevalent than previously recognized and highly associated with both ventricular tachycardia and pacemaker requirement. The likelihood of an adverse event, either cardiovascular mortality or cardiac transplantation, was significantly greater for patients with giant cell myocarditis than for those with lymphocytic myocarditis, perhaps because of the progressive decline in left ventricular systolic function that was observed in those with giant cell myocarditis. 
5	Treatment of severe acne with isotretinoin in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Four patients with inflammatory bowel disease and severe cystic acne were treated with isotretinoin. Two patients had a successful course of treatment without any gastrointestinal side-effects. One patient had two episodes of profuse rectal bleeding that were probably related to pre-existing haemorrhoids. The fourth patient had a flare-up of his Crohn's disease after starting isotretinoin. 
4	Doxazosin: a study in a cohort of patients with hypertension in general practice--an interim report. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of doxazosin in a substantial cohort of hypertensive patients drawn from general practice. A total of 4027 patients entered the study, 1472 of whom (36.6%) were untreated hypertensive patients. Patients were not advised to change diet, smoking habit, or life-style during the study. Twenty-one percent were cigarette smokers, and concurrent diabetes was present in 2.3%. Baseline blood cholesterol exceeded 200 mg/dl (5.2 mmol/L) in 90% and 250 mg/dl (6.5 mmol/L) in 56% of patients. The mean decrease in blood pressure produced by doxazosin was 22/15 mm Hg after 10 weeks of therapy; there was a mean decrease in heart rate of 1 beat/min. The mean maintenance dose for all patients was 3.1 mg/day. Side effects considered related or possibly related to treatment were reported in 705 patients. Treatment was discontinued in 233 patients (5.8%) because of adverse events related or possibly related to treatment with doxazosin. Doxazosin produced a significant (p less than 0.001) decrease in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the ratio of high-density lipoprotein:total cholesterol. The potential reduction in 10-year coronary heart disease risk (according to the Framingham equation) was calculated to be 20.4%. 
1	Clinical significance of the "palpable mass" in patients with muscle-infiltrating bladder cancer undergoing cystectomy after pre-operative radiotherapy. Between 1976 and 1985, 132 patients with T2/T3/T4a bladder cancer underwent cystectomy after pre-operative radiotherapy (46 Gy: 67 patients; 20 Gy: 65 patients). After a median time of 41 months, 62 patients were alive; 51 had died from recurrent bladder cancer and 19 from intercurrent disease without recurrence of their malignancy. Distant metastases developed in 40 patients, accompanied in 5 cases by local recurrence. Local recurrence was the first sign of relapse in 11 patients. In 3 patients the localisation of the relapse remained unknown. The corrected 5-year survival rate was 60%. T category and a palpable bladder tumour were independent pre-treatment prognostic factors in a Cox regression analysis, together with the interval between initial diagnosis and cystectomy. The presence of a palpable tumour before the start of treatment was associated with a particularly poor prognosis in T3/T4a tumours, whereas the survival of patients with non-palpable T3/T4a tumours was similar to that of patients with T2 bladder cancer. Another important prognostic factor was post-irradiation stage reduction (no residual muscle infiltration in the cystectomy specimen). Significantly more patients with non-palpable bladder tumours experienced post-radiation stage reduction than did those with a palpable tumour. However, the prognostic value of stage reduction was statistically significant only in patients with palpable bladder tumours. 
1	Accessory arm--dysraphism or disparity? Case report. The case of a 3-month-old infant with an accessory third arm is reported. The extra appendage was attached at the midcervical region and was associated with posterior cervical dysraphism and a cervical cord lipoma. Possible theories of origin are examined. 
1	Changes in the clearance of total and unbound etoposide in patients with liver dysfunction. The disposition of total and non-protein-bound etoposide was investigated in 21 cancer patients receiving etoposide and cisplatin combination chemotherapy. Etoposide plasma concentrations were determined using a specific high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method, and etoposide plasma protein binding was determined by equilibrium dialysis. The patients had a wide range of renal function (creatinine clearance, 32 to 159 mL/min/m2) and hepatic function (total bilirubin range, 0.3 to 21.5 mg/dL; aspartate aminotransferase [AST] range, 14 to 415 IU/L; serum albumin range, 2.7 to 4.1 g/dL). The mean etoposide total systemic clearance was not different in 15 patients with total bilirubin less than 1.0 mg/dL versus six patients with total bilirubin 1.1 to 21.5 mg/dL (18.7 +/- 5.9 mL/min/m2 v 26.4 +/- 10.7 mL/min/m2; t-test P = .06), with a trend toward higher total clearance in the patients with abnormal bilirubin values. However, the mean clearance of unbound etoposide was significantly lower in patients with increased total bilirubin (220 +/- 90 mL/min/m2 v 135 +/- 61 mL/min/m2; t-test P = .027). The fraction of etoposide unbound (fu) in plasma was significantly higher in patients with increased bilirubin (9% +/- 3% v 27% +/- 15%; t-test P = .002), explaining the trend toward higher total clearance in these patients. Etoposide clearance (total or unbound) in the 14 patients with measurable hepatic metastases was not different from the clearance in the seven patients without hepatic metastases. This study provides an explanation for why patients with increased bilirubin do not have lower total systemic clearance of etoposide, and indicates that such patients have a higher exposure to unbound etoposide. The results of ongoing pharmacodynamic studies of total and unbound etoposide in patients with increased bilirubin will determine the clinical relevance of altered etoposide protein binding. 
5	Optimum results of the surgical treatment of carotid territory ischemia. Continuing controversy over the role of carotid endarterectomy in stroke prevention is based largely on reports in which high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates obviate possible long-term benefit from the procedure. The purpose of this review is to examine optimal results of carotid surgery in order to describe the potential for the procedure in stroke prevention. Optimal surgical results are compared with optimal medical results in the therapy of symptomatic patients and with optimal nonsurgical results in the therapy of asymptomatic patients. Factors common to series with excellent results, such as patient selection and operative technique, are examined, and problems such as recurrent carotid stenosis and coexisting coronary disease, which continue to plague even the best surgical series, are discussed. 
5	Pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy: an overview. Pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy (PPPD) was reintroduced 12 years ago. Since that time, over 400 patients have undergone PPPD with approximately 41 per cent having chronic pancreatitis and 54 per cent having pancreatic and other periampullary malignancies. Reported 5-year survivals in this latter group have been comparable to those achieved by the classic Whipple procedure. The postoperative mortality rate in 339 reported patients has been 3.8 per cent. Postoperative morbidity, including delayed gastric emptying, has been similar to that of the classic Whipple operation. However, PPPD has been associated with fewer late problems with dumping, diarrhoea, delayed gastric emptying (8.6 per cent), and marginal ulceration (3.6 per cent). Moreover, most patients undergoing PPPD have been able to return to their preoperative and preillness weight. The additional advantage of decreased operative time makes PPPD an attractive alternative to the classic pancreatoduodenectomy. 
3	Localization of stereotactic targets by microrecordings of thalamic somatosensory evoked potentials. To improve the localization of stereotactic targets, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded from the thalamus and subthalamic area using a specially designed semimicroelectrode in 61 patients and a conventional "macroelectrode" in 17 patients. By means of the semimicroelectrode, median nerve stimulation evoked two distinct SEPs, consisting of a diphasic wave with a huge positivity restricted to the nucleus ventrocaudalis (Vc) and a triphasic wave of lower amplitude with a major negativity in the ventral part of the nucleus ventrointermedius (Vim) and nucleus ventrooralis posterior (Vop) as well as the subthalamic lemniscal pathway. The Vim-Vc junction could thus be clearly delineated by an abrupt transition of SEPs from one type to the other with a precision of 1 mm. The parvicellular part of the Vc (Vcpc), situated in its basal region, was distinguishable from the Vc proper by a significant reduction of the positivity elicited by stimulation of the median nerve and by a rapid growth of a diphasic SEPs to stimulation of the posterior tibial nerve. In the other thalamic nuclei, stimulation of the median nerve elicited triphasic SEPs of a very small amplitude, suggesting a volume conduction current from the lemniscal pathway. With the macroelectrode, the positivity in the Vc was sensitive to electrode manipulation and the thalamic nuclei could not be distinctly outlined. SEP monitoring using the semimicroelectrode significantly improved the precision of target localization, which allowed minimizing of the volume of the therapeutic lesion without losing surgical effectiveness, while avoiding complications associated with increased penetration of the coagulating electrode. It is suggested that recording serial thalamic SEPs with the semimicroelectrode is a practical method to refine stereotactic targets in the thalamus. 
5	Airways inflammation in nocturnal asthma. Nocturnal asthma is a frequent problem, but the mechanism is unclear. We investigated the possibility that airways inflammation occurred during the night. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was analyzed in asthmatic patients with (n = 7) and without nocturnal asthma (n = 7) at 1600 and 0400 h. The nocturnal asthma group had an increase in the total leukocyte count (24.0 +/- 7.0 to 41.1 +/- 9.9 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05), neutrophils (1.1 +/- 0.6 to 3.7 +/- 1.5 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05), and eosinophils (0.5 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(4) cells/ml, p less than 0.05) from 1600 to 0400 h. Cellular components for the non-nocturnal asthma group did not change. Between groups, the 1600-h cells were similar. At 0400 h the nocturnal asthma group had significantly higher total leukocyte, neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, and epithelial cell counts. For all subjects, the overnight fall in peak expiratory flow rates was correlated to the change in neutrophils (r = 0.54, p less than 0.05) and eosinophils (r = 0.77, p less than 0.05). We conclude that the nocturnal worsening of asthma has an associated cellular inflammatory response that is not seen in patients without overnight decrements in lung function. This inflammatory response together with epithelial damage may be important factors in the etiology of nocturnal asthma. 
2	Gallstone pancreatitis. Gallstone pancreatitis is caused by transient obstruction of the ampulla of Vater by a migrating gallstone. Intraglandular activation of pancreatic enzymes occurs (by an unclear mechanism), and their entry into the circulation causes most of the local and systemic events of pancreatitis. The diagnosis is based on history and physical examination, an elevation of serum amylase above 1000 IU/L, and ultrasound and CT scans. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography can be used in less certain cases to confirm the presence of common bile duct stones. Because of the absence of an agent that can abort progression of the disease, therapy should consist of adequate resuscitation, nutritional support, and careful monitoring to detect early complications. In patients with mild pancreatitis, surgery usually can be performed within 48 or 72 hours of admission or as soon as symptoms and amylase levels return to normal. For patients with severe disease, endoscopic sphincterotomy is emerging as the therapeutic modality of choice. Elective treatment of the associated biliary disease should be performed during the same hospitalization after the acute phase of the disease has subsided. 
5	Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of wounds and cutaneous abscesses. The aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of 584 wounds and 676 skin or soft-tissue abscesses were studied and correlated with the infection site. In wounds, aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 223 specimens (38%), anaerobes only in 177 specimens (30%), and mixed flora in 184 specimens (32%). In total there were 1470 isolates, 558 aerobic and 912 anaerobic, an average of 2.5 isolates per wound (1.6 anaerobic and 0.9 aerobic isolates). In abscesses, aerobic or facultative bacteria were recovered in 177 specimens (26%), anaerobes only in 243 specimens (36%), and mixed flora in 256 specimens (38%). In total there were 1702 isolates, 602 aerobic and 1100 anaerobic, an average of 2.5 isolates per abscess. The highest rates of anaerobes in wounds were in the inguinal, buttocks, and trunk areas and in abscesses in the perirectal, external genitalia, neck, and inguinal areas. The predominant aerobic organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (363 isolates), group A streptococci (98 isolates), and Escherichia coli (97 isolates). The predominant anaerobic organisms were Bacteroides species (986 isolates), Peptostreptococcus species (559 isolates), Clostridium species (153 isolates), and Fusobacterium species (109 isolates). The predominance of certain isolates in certain anatomical sites was correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of wounds and cutaneous abscesses. 
5	Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy. Twenty-eight of 61 members of a six-generation family are affected by an autosomal dominant eye disease which has not been described previously. Affected patients are asymptomatic in early adulthood, but have vitreous cells and the selective loss of the b-wave on the electroretinogram. Later, peripheral retinal scarring and pigmentation, peripheral arteriolar closure, and neovascularization of the peripheral retina at the ora serrata or occasionally neovascularization of the optic disc develop. Cystoid macular edema, vitreous hemorrhage, tractional retinal detachment, and neovascular glaucoma can cause profound visual loss. Vitrectomy reduces traction on the retina and allows for retinal reattachment. The role of argon laser photocoagulation or cryopexy in reducing the neovascular complications remains uncertain. 
1	Multifocal, synchronous inverted papillomas involving the ureter. Inverted papillomas involving the upper urinary tract remain a rarely diagnosed phenomenon. A case of bilateral ureteral inverted papillomas is presented. The treatment and diagnosis of this lesion remain a challenge. 
4	Management of aortobronchial fistula with graft replacement and omentopexy. Massive hemoptysis due to a recurrent aortobronchial fistula after repair of a thoracic aortic aneurysm developed in a 64-year-old woman. The infected aortic tissue was resected and replaced with an in situ Dacron graft covered by omentum. The patient is alive and well 15 months later. 
1	Herniation of the antral membrane through an extraction site. Report of a case. A case of herniation of the antral membrane through a recent extraction site is presented. The lesion was initially diagnosed as a tumor by the referring dentist. Oroantral fistulas are not an uncommon finding after dental extractions. It is rare, however, to see herniation of the antral membrane with large polyps extending through the fistula into the oral cavity. A search of the literature revealed only two other such cases. Surgical removal of the polyps and closure of the oroantral fistula by means of a buccal sliding flap technique is discussed. 
5	Lyme borreliosis in the severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) mouse manifests predominantly in the joints, heart, and liver. The authors describe the histopathologic evolution of Lyme disease in severe combined immunodeficiency (scid) and normal C.B-17 and C57BL/6 mice inoculated with Borrelia burgdorferi. Starting on day 7 after inoculation, all scid mice infected subcutaneously in the tail with a low-passage European tick isolate of B. burgdorferi had clinical evidence of arthritis characterized by reddening and swelling of tibiotarsal joints. Later on, other joints, ie, metatarsal and ulnacarpal joints were also affected. The infection of scid mice resulted in a persistent spirochetemia and the development of a multisystem disease with chronic progressive inflammation of joints, heart, and liver. Major histopathologic alterations included 1) severe joint lesions, characterized by the presence of hyperplastic inflamed synovial lining cells associated with the erosion and destruction of cartilage and/or bone; 2) pancarditis with infiltrations of mononuclear cells in the endocardium, myocardium, and pericardium; and 3) hepatitis with mononuclear cell infiltrations confined to the portal field and central vein, granulomatous reactions, and eventually the development of liver fibrosis. In addition, smaller more confined lesions were found in kidneys, lung, brain, and striated muscle. The inflammatory infiltrates in the various organs were associated mostly with Mac-1+ cells, largely monocytes and macrophages, as well as some polymorphonuclear leukocytes, but not B and T lymphocytes. Infective spirochetes could be readily isolated from blood and joints and were found at the site of inoculum and the myocardium. In contrast, subcutaneous inoculation of normal C.B-17 or C57BL/6 mice with spirochetes in general did not result in clinical signs of arthritis. Only 10% to 20% of the C57BL/6 mice, but none of the C.B-17 mice, showed clinical evidence of oligoarthritis, which appeared not before day 36 after inoculation. In general, the infection of normal mice resulted in minimal lesions in various organs, and no spirochetes could be visualized or reisolated from their tissues. The data demonstrate that Lyme borreliosis may develop in mice in the absence of detectable specific B and T cells and thus suggest an immunologic control of the disease in this species. The scid mouse model therefore can be used to define the components of the immune system responsible for the suppression and/or the progression of the disease. 
5	Pelvic floor descent in women: dynamic evaluation with fast MR imaging and cinematic display. The authors present a new method for assessing pelvic prolapse with dynamic fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Twenty-six women with signs and symptoms suggesting pelvic prolapse and 16 control subjects were studied with a series of fast (6-12-second) MR images. Sagittal and coronal images were obtained with graded increase in voluntary pelvic strain, allowing for dynamic display and quantification of the pelvic prolapse process. The distance from the pubococcygeal line was used as an internal reference for measurement of descent in the maximal strain position. With use of control results for normal limit values, prolapse involving the anterior pelvic compartment (cystocele), the middle compartment (vaginal prolapse, uterine prolapse, and enterocele), and the posterior compartment (rectocele) was easily demonstrated. Significant differences between control subjects and patients with prolapse were seen at maximal strain but not in the relaxed state. Quantification of the pelvic descent process with use of fast MR imaging may be of value in surgical planning and postsurgical follow-up. 
5	Induction of inflammatory cell infiltration and necrosis in normal mouse skin by the combined treatment of tumor necrosis factor and lithium chloride. Previously we reported that lithium chloride (LiCl) potentiates tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Here, using a murine normal skin model, it is shown that a subcutaneous injection of TNF plus LiCl induces acute dermal and subcutaneous inflammation and necrosis. Histology showed a marked initial dermal and subcutaneous neutrophil infiltrate by approximately 2 hours, followed by a predominantly mononuclear infiltrate by 24 hours, which remained present for several days. Tumor necrosis factor or LiCl alone induced negligible inflammation, disappearing after 6 hours; furthermore there was never necrosis or ulceration of the overlying skin in case of single-agent application. In vitro studies showed that the combination of TNF and LiCl, but not either agent alone, was directly cytotoxic to fibroblastic cells of murine skin. No inflammatory infiltration was visible in tumors treated intratumorally or perilesionally with TNF plus LiCl, although the latter treatment resulted in a perilesional leukocyte infiltration. Furthermore the combination of TNF and LiCl had no effect on macrophage cytotoxicity to L929 tumors. 
4	Expert testimony based on decision analysis: a malpractice case report. OBJECTIVE: Expert testimony in malpractice cases is often subjective and biased. Decision-analytic techniques might provide an objective basis for such testimony. DESIGN: Case report. This article reports the case of a patient with chest pain that resulted in a malpractice suit alleging a delay in diagnosis of coronary artery disease. SETTING: The case occurred in a private practice; the expert witnesses and the decision analysis originated from a university teaching hospital. METHODS: A decision tree and threshold analysis were used to define the thresholds of disease probability at which either testing or treatment should be implemented. The expert testimony of two witnesses that exercise stress testing was the standard of care was compared with the results of the decision analysis. MAIN RESULTS: Decision analysis supported the view that cardiac catheterization would have been the more appropriate test. CONCLUSIONS: Techniques of decision analysis provide a structured and quantitative basis for empirical judgment and may help to minimize current problems with expert testimony. 
3	Cardiac echinococcosis with fatal intracerebral embolism. A previously well 7 year old boy presented with sudden loss of consciousness and fitting. No evidence of trauma or space occupying lesion was identified. Death occurred the next day due to cerebral infarction caused by embolised fragments from a ruptured left ventricular hydatid cyst that was found at necropsy. 
4	Propafenone treatment of symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias. A randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial in patients tolerating oral therapy. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that propafenone, administered orally, prevents symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: a 6-month, open-label, dose-finding phase followed by a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover phase, with each treatment period lasting up to 60 days. SETTING: An outpatient clinic. PATIENTS: Thirty-three patients with either paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (n = 16) or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (n = 17) were enrolled. Their arrhythmias were documented by electrocardiogram before enrollment. Twenty-three patients (14 with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia and 9 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation) were randomized and the data obtained from these patients were used in the efficacy analysis. INTERVENTION: Propafenone (300 mg three times daily in 19 patients, 300 mg twice daily in 3 patients, and 150 mg twice daily in 1 patient) and matching placebo tablets were administered in a randomized sequence. MEASUREMENTS: Symptomatic arrhythmia was documented by telephone transmission of the electrocardiogram. MAIN RESULTS: The time to first recurrence was prolonged for the overall group of 23 patients while they received propafenone (P = 0.004). The recurrence rate of arrhythmia during treatment with propafenone was estimated to be approximately one fifth of the recurrence rate during treatment with placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Propafenone is effective in reducing symptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular arrhythmias. 
5	Human papillomavirus type 16 associated with oral squamous carcinoma in a cardiac transplant recipient. Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) has been associated with a variety of squamous carcinomas, particularly those involving the anogenital tract. The authors report the development of an oropharyngeal carcinoma in a 43-year-old man approximately 20 months after cardiac transplantation while he was on a maintenance regimen of cyclosporine A and prednisone. The carcinoma was resistant to treatment, and he died of complications related to metastatic disease 3 years posttransplantation. Molecular biologic studies using nonisotopic-labeled viral DNA probes were done. In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of HPV 16 DNA in the tumor cells. DNA dot blot analysis confirmed the presence of multiple copies of HPV 16 DNA within the tumor cells and their absence from adjacent normal-appearing tissue. Southern blot analysis suggested that the HPV 16 DNA was integrated into the tumor cell genome. With increasing recognition of the carcinogenicity of HPV type 16 infection, a role for this virus in the development of squamous cell malignancies in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients is likely to be noted with increasing frequency. 
1	Scintigraphic evaluation of aggressive fibromatosis. Despite its benign microscopic appearance, aggressive fibromatosis has potential to recur and infiltrate neighboring tissues. Therefore, it is necessary to determine the exact extent before therapy. In the present study, 11 cases of aggressive fibromatosis were examined scintigraphically using [99mTc(V)]dimercaptosuccinic acid (11 cases) and 67Ga-citrate (7 cases). Technetium-99m-(V)-dimercaptosuccinic acid demonstrated all lesions, while 67Ga-citrate detected 57% of the cases. 
4	Failure of Hancock pericardial xenografts: is prophylactic bioprosthetic replacement justified? The incidence of major valve-related complications was evaluated in a series of patients in whom the Hancock pericardial xenograft was used for aortic (AVR; n = 84), mitral (MVR; n = 17) and mitral-aortic (MAVR; n = 13) valve replacement. At 7 years actuarial survival is 66% +/- 8% after AVR, 64% +/- 13% after MVR, and 41% +/- 15% after MAVR, whereas actuarial freedom from valve-related death is 79% +/- 7% after AVR, 78% +/- 13% after MVR, and 81% +/- 12% after MAVR. Actuarial freedom from thromboemboli and anticoagulant-related hemorrhage at 7 years is 93% +/- 4% and 98% +/- 2% after AVR and 83% +/- 10% and 88% +/- 11% after MVR; no such complications occurred after MAVR. Structural valve deterioration determined at reoperation, at autopsy, or by clinical investigation was observed in 34 patients with AVR (10.0 +/- 0.2%/patient-year), in 10 with MVR (10.6 +/- 3.3%/patient-year), and in 9 with MAVR (16.6 +/- 5.5%/patient-year). After AVR, 19 patients underwent reoperation and 2 died before reoperation; 4 patients with MVR underwent reoperation, and 7 patients with MAVR underwent reoperation and 1 died before reoperation. Seventy-eight percent of the current survivors (13 patients with AVR, 7 with MVR, and 1 with MAVR) have clinical evidence of valve failure. At 7 years actuarial freedom from structural deterioration of the Hancock pericardial xenograft is 25% +/- 7% after AVR, 29% +/- 14% after MVR, and 0% after MAVR. 
1	The association of hydrocephalus with intramedullary spinal cord tumors: a series of 25 patients. 171 patients with intramedullary spinal cord tumors were operated on, of which 25 patients (15%), mostly children, developed symptomatic hydrocephalus. Twenty patients (12%) had malignant tumors, with 13 of the 20 cases (63%) complicated by increased intracranial pressure and ventriculomegaly. Of the remaining 151 patients with benign tumors (89%), only 12 (8%) developed symptomatic hydrocephalus. In an effort to understand the relationship between hydrocephalus and intramedullary spinal cord tumor, the authors analyze the level and histology of the neoplasm, as well as its association with spinal cysts. A review of the neurosurgical literature reveals that 34 similar cases of hydrocephalus associated with intramedullary spinal cord tumors have been reported to date. The authors note that the presence of hydrocephalus in patients with malignant intramedullary astrocytomas is associated with a shorter rate of survival than in those patients with high-grade lesions but without hydrocephalus, apparently due to rapid tumor progression. The ventriculomegaly seen with benign spinal cord gliomas has no statistically significant effect upon long-term prognosis. 
5	Botulinum-induced changes in monkey eyelid muscle. Comparison with changes seen in extraocular muscle. Botulin type A was injected into the eyelids of adult monkeys, and structural alterations in the orbicularis oculi muscle were evaluated after survival times of 7 to 84 days. The most profound change seen at both the light- and electron-microscopic levels was nonselective atrophy of virtually all muscle fibers. Moreover, the botulin-induced blockade of neuromuscular transmission was nonspecific in producing alterations in the three orbicularis fiber types. Muscle structural changes appeared to be reversible, with no apparent long-term consequences. While sprouting of preterminal axons was noted in botulin-treated muscle, formation of collateral sprouts did not appear to be widespread. These changes contrast with the fiber type-specific, long-term alterations induced in extraocular muscle by botulin treatment. However, this differential response may be attributed to the very clear differences in fiber type composition and motor control mechanisms between eyelid and extraocular muscle groups. The efficacy of botulin treatments for strabismus and focal dystonia may then be directly related to both the anatomic fiber type composition and the functional properties of motor control systems of the injected muscle. 
5	Computed tomography for evaluation of puerperal infections. Pelvic computed tomography was used to evaluate 74 women with persistent puerperal infection. There was at least one abnormal roentgenographic finding in 57, and these are correlated with clinical and surgical findings. In 16 women, a palpable pelvic mass was seen on tomography, however, masses not appreciated clinically were visualized in another 29 women, and in five, a clinically palpable mass was not visualized by tomography. In 12 women who had a normal pelvic examination, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis was diagnosed by tomography. Over-all, there was poor correlation with roentgenographic findings and uterine incisional necrosis and dehiscence. We conclude that pelvic tomography is useful to evaluate some women with persistent puerperal infection, but that these studies must be correlated with clinical findings. 
5	Impact of active immunisation against enteritis necroticans in Papua New Guinea. Enteritis necroticans, known locally as pigbel, has been a major cause of illness and death among children in the highlands of Papua New Guinea. After a successful trial of active immunisation against the beta toxin of the causative organism, Clostridium perfringens type C, immunisation of children was begun in 1980. The effects of the immunisation programme on pigbel admissions in 3 of the 5 major highland hospitals were assessed. In each of the centres studied the proportion of admissions due to enteritis necroticans dropped significantly after immunisation was introduced (p less than 0.001) and hospital admissions for pigbel in 1984-86, when immunisation was well established, were less than one fifth of previous figures. 
2	Pathophysiology, monitoring, and management of the ventilator-dependent patient: considerations for drug therapy, emphasis on stress ulcer prophylaxis. Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or noncardiac pulmonary edema, is a form of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The goals of treatment for patients with ARDS are to provide supportive therapy, to reverse the underlying etiology or pathology, and to prevent subsequent complications. Supportive therapy consists of supplemental oxygen, positive end-expiratory pressure, and, often, mechanical ventilation. The reversal of the underlying pathology varies according to the etiologic origin of ARDS. Complications from ARDS include stress ulcers, which occur when gastric aggressive and defensive functions become unbalanced. Antacids and cytoprotective agents are used for stress ulcer prophylaxis, but histamine H2-receptor antagonists are now regarded as the standard of care. Because all the marketed H2-receptor antagonists are efficacious, choice of the agent is based on the adverse effect profile and drug interactions. No definitive data currently exist linking stress ulcer prophylaxis regimens that raise intragastric pH to a significant risk for nosocomial pneumonia. 
1	Interleukin-5 is a human basophilopoietin: induction of histamine content and basophilic differentiation of HL-60 cells and of peripheral blood basophil-eosinophil progenitors. Cytokine-induced differentiation of basophils may contribute to various inflammatory processes. We examined the effects of recombinant human interleukin-5 (IL-5) and other human cytokines in vitro on myeloid colony formation in methylcellulose and on alkaline passaged HL-60 basophilic cell differentiation. Myeloid colonies (CFU-C) at day 14, formed in the presence of either IL-3, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or G-CSF included peripheral blood-derived progenitors of the eosinophil/basophil lineage. IL-5 stimulated a greater proportion of basophil-containing, histamine-positive, eosinophil-type colonies compared with GM-CSF, IL-3, or G-CSF. IL-5 also stimulated dose-dependent increases in histamine content of alkaline-passaged, butyrate cotreated HL-60 cells. The concentration of IL-5 required for half-maximal induction of HL-60 histamine content was similar within twofold to that needed for half-maximal stimulation of the multifactor dependent TF-1 erythroleukemic cell line. Neutralizing rat monoclonal antibodies to human IL-5 were developed and used to demonstrate that each of these IL-5 bioactivities could be specifically blocked. We conclude that in addition to its previously described eosinophil differentiation activity, IL-5 may be considered a basophilopoietin. 
5	Penetrating iliac vascular injuries: recent experience with 233 consecutive patients. During a recent 11-year period, 233 consecutive patients with 358 penetrating iliac vascular injuries were treated at our institution. Injuries of the common and external iliac arteries were most often repaired with lateral suture (31%) although several other techniques were also employed. Lateral suture and ligation were used with nearly equal frequency in the management of venous injuries. The hospital mortality rate for the series was 28%, and 56/66 deaths (85%) were due to exsanguination or shock. One patient, initially treated with an end-to-end anastomosis of the iliac artery, died a year after discharge from a ruptured false aneurysm. Two patients treated with lateral suture of venous injuries died of pulmonary embolism. Arterial complications occurred in 15% of patients with arterial injuries and three patients required amputation. No graft infections occurred in 16 patients treated with PTFE interpositions, including four with associated colorectal injuries. Venous complications occurred in 12% of patients with venous injuries, and most were noted in those treated with ligation. Four patients treated by venous ligation developed chronic venous insufficiency. The prevention of death from exsanguination is the greatest problem in the management of patients with iliac vascular injuries. Although some late deaths and many complications may be related to the technique of vascular repair, circumstances often prohibit alternative methods. Despite two deaths from pulmonary embolism, insufficient data exist to condemn lateral suture of venous injuries. 
1	Respiratory epithelium in a cystic choristoma of the limbus. A female newborn had a cystic, whitish gray mass at the inferotemporal limbus of the left eye. At age 3 weeks, the newborn underwent excision of the tumor, corneal patch grafting, and superior sector optical iridectomy. Histopathologic and electron microscopic examination of the excised tissue revealed a choristoma consisting of cysts lined with respiratory epithelium. To our knowledge, respiratory epithelium in a limbal choristoma has not been previously reported. 
1	Effects of carotenoids in cellular and animal systems. It has been suggested that carotenoid pigments may function as chemopreventive agents for reducing the risk of cancer in humans. Part of this suggestion rests on epidemiological evidence, and part rests on work done in cellular and animal systems. In this article, the experimental evidence for carotenoid inhibition of mutagenicity, malignant transformation, tumor formation, and immunoenhancement is reviewed. Although a mechanism for these effects cannot yet be identified, it is clear that the overwhelming evidence in these systems would indicate that carotenoids exert an important influence in modulating the actions of carcinogens. 
1	Prognostic factors in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with transcatheter arterial embolization and arterial infusion. From January 1986 to December 1988, a prospective trial of transcatheter arterial treatment was carried out for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two hundred seventy-five patients were included. Okuda's staging system was employed. Patients with Stage I and II HCC were treated by transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with a gelatin sponge containing an anti-cancer agent (protocol 1a); a gelatin sponge and iodized oil mixed with an anti-cancer agent (protocol 1b); or iodized oil mixed with an anti-cancer agent (protocol 2). Patients with Stage III HCC were treated with iodized oil with anti-cancer agent (protocol 2). As an exception, patients with an unsuccessful superselective catheterization into the proper hepatic artery by Seldinger technique or obstruction of the main trunk of the portal vein were treated with percutaneous transcatheter arterial infusion into the common hepatic artery regardless of stage (protocol 3). Tumor type and extension, area of tumor involvement, portal vein involvement, method of treatment, and presence of ascites and icterus were found to be the significant factors for an initial response to therapy. Treatment method was the most important factor. Respective survival rates at 1 and 2 years were 70.9% and 55.3% for protocol 1a; 62.3% and 43.8% for protocol 1b; 37.8% and 18.3% for protocol 2; and 16.5% and 0% for protocol 3. Many factors proved to significantly influenced prognosis; however, tumor type had the most important prognostic significance followed by AFP value, ascites, treatment protocol, and area of tumor involvement. 
5	Acute pain relief. Pain is a multidimensional psychophysiologic phenomenon. Systematic multidimensional assessment is an essential first component of an effective plan to relieve the pain. Nurses are key to effective pain management because of the close, 24-hour-a-day relationship with the hospitalized patient. It is the nurse who is most critical to the adequate assessment of pain, to the implementation of the treatment plan, and to the evaluation of efficacy. Nurses should continue to develop a better knowledge base about pain and pain therapies and assessment skills, be assertive in obtaining effective treatment for their patients, and perceive themselves as responsible for pain relief. 
5	Surgical aspects of malaria. The spread of drug-resistant organisms and increased international travel makes malaria a disorder of ever-increasing importance. This report reviews those aspects of malaria of surgical relevance. The importance of the spleen in host defence against malaria and other infections makes splenic preservation desirable whenever possible after rupture of the spleen. Tropical splenomegaly is caused by an abnormal immune response to malaria and is best managed medically. Careful selection of blood donors is essential to prevent transfusion malaria, and routine antimalarial prophylaxis is indicated for blood recipients in many endemic areas. The risk of postoperative malaria may justify chemoprophylaxis in certain patients. 
1	Loss of expression of blood group antigen H is associated with cellular invasion and spread of oral squamous cell carcinomas. Membrane-bound carbohydrates may influence the metastatic behavior of cancer cells. Forty-two squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) of the buccal and maxillary alveolar mucosa were studied retrospectively using a monoclonal antibody (BE2) that reacts with blood group H (type 2 chain) structure. H-antigen staining within the entire tumor did not correlate with the stage of the tumor, i.e., spread of the tumors. However, loss of staining within the most invasive sites of the tumors correlated significantly with the stage of tumor development and histologic grade of malignancy. These findings support the view that features relating to the cells of deeper parts of the carcinomas are very important for the clinical behavior of the tumors, and that loss of H-antigen expression is related to the stage of tumor and invasion of carcinoma cells. 
4	Complement activation is a secondary rather than a causative factor in rabbit pulmonary artery ischemia/reperfusion injury. We have previously demonstrated that reperfusion of a rabbit lung in vivo after 24 h of unilateral pulmonary artery occlusion results in edema, transient leukopenia, and intravascular leukocyte aggregation. We hypothesized that complement was activated by reperfusion and that this in turn contributed to lung injury. In the preliminary phase of the study, we found that ischemia followed by reperfusion resulted in a drop in C3 to 15 +/- 10% (mean +/- SEM) of the prereperfusion value as compared with no change in a group of control animals that had undergone an identical thoracotomy but without pulmonary artery occlusion and reperfusion (p less than 0.05). We then studied three groups of animals to determine if complement depletion with cobra venom factor (CVF) prior to ischemia and reperfusion would prevent the injury. Rabbits treated with CVF but without occlusion and reperfusion did not develop significant lung edema, with left and right lung wet/dry ratios of 5.32 +/- 0.11 and 5.26 +/- 0.12, respectively. For rabbits that were not treated with CVF but underwent ischemia and reperfusion, the comparable numbers were 6.15 +/- 0.36 and 5.19 +/- 0.32 (p less than 0.05 for right versus left). For CVF-treated rabbits that underwent ischemia and reperfusion, the right/left difference persisted (6.77 +/- 0.48 versus 5.35 +/- 0.14, p less than 0.01). Immunocytochemistry documented C3 deposition in non-CVF rabbits that underwent ischemia and reperfusion but not in CVF-treated rabbits. We conclude that ischemia/reperfusion of the lung results in complement activation, but it is not a complement-dependent injury. 
1	An epidemiologic study of abuse of analgesic drugs. Effects of phenacetin and salicylate on mortality and cardiovascular morbidity (1968 to 1987) BACKGROUND. Phenacetin abuse is known to produce kidney disease; salicylate use is supposed to prevent cardiovascular disease. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal epidemiologic study to examine the effects of these drugs on cause-specific mortality and on cardiovascular morbidity. METHODS. In 1968 we evaluated a study group of 623 healthy women 30 to 49 years old who had evidence of a regular intake of phenacetin, as measured by urinary excretion of its metabolites, and a matched control group of 621 women. Salicylate excretion was also measured. All subjects were examined over a period of 20 years. RESULTS. Life-table analyses of mortality during the 20 years, with adjustment for the year of birth, cigarette smoking, and length of follow-up, revealed significant differences between the groups in overall mortality (study group vs. control group, 74 vs. 27 deaths; relative risk, 2.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 3.3), deaths due to urologic or renal disease (relative risk, 16.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.9 to 66.1), deaths due to cancer (relative risk, 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.3), and deaths due to cardiovascular disease (relative risk, 2.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 5.5). The relative risk of cardiovascular disease (fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke) was 1.8, and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.3 to 2.6. The odds ratio for the incidence of hypertension was 1.6, and the 95 percent confidence interval 1.2 to 2.1. The effects of phenacetin on morbidity and mortality, with adjustment for base-line salicylate excretion, were similar. In contrast, salicylate use had no effect on either mortality or morbidity. CONCLUSIONS. Regular use of analgesic drugs containing phenacetin is associated with an increased risk of hypertension and mortality and morbidity due to cardiovascular disease, as well as an increased risk of mortality due to cancer and urologic or renal disease. The use of salicylates carries no such risk. 
1	Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is an extremely rare entity. Because of its unusual clinical presentation and confusing histologic picture, a diagnosis of malignancy is frequently made. Thus the surgeon is closely involved with the case and extensive procedures are not uncommon. However, this lesion is benign and will even regress spontaneously, making radical surgical procedures contraindicated. The difficulty lies in establishing an accurate diagnosis and the histologic pitfalls of this particular process. Conservative therapy can then be applied, avoiding surgical morbidity. 
5	Sudden death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with normal left ventricular mass An active, healthy, and symptom free 16 year old boy with a family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy died suddenly while walking home from school. Necropsy showed absence of left ventricular hypertrophy (that is, normal heart weight), though the characteristic histological abnormalities of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, such as cardiac muscle cell disorganisation and abnormal intramural coronary arteries, were present. It is likely that this patient had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and died before left ventricular hypertrophy developed. 
1	Behavioral and psychosocial cancer research. Building on the past, preparing for the future. This report identifies five general conclusions that emerged from the Second Workshop on Methodology in Behavioral and Psychosocial Cancer Research. These conclusions address diverse topics, including a focus on areas other than methodology; an emphasis on the transfer of technology and knowledge to applied settings; a recognition of the role of basic behavioral research in answering clinical questions; the need to recognize and strengthen ties between the field of behavioral and psychosocial oncology and the basic behavioral and social science fields from which it emerged; and the importance of additional research on minorities and other special populations. It is suggested that meeting the challenges posed in each of these five areas is critical to continued progress in the field. 
4	Transient myocardial ischaemia after acute myocardial infarction. The prevalence and characteristics of transient myocardial ischaemia were studied in 203 patients with recent acute myocardial infarction by both early (6.4 days) and late (38 days) ambulatory monitoring of the ST segment. Transient ST segment depression was much commoner during late (32% patients) than early (14%) monitoring. Most transient ischaemia (greater than 85% episodes) was silent and 80% of patients had only silent episodes. During late monitoring painful ST depression was accompanied by greater ST depression and tended to occur at a higher heart rate. Late transient ischaemia showed a diurnal distribution, occurred at a higher initial heart rate, and was more often accompanied by a further increase in heart rate than early ischaemia. Thus in the first 2 months after myocardial infarction transient ischaemia became increasingly common and more closely associated with increased myocardial oxygen demand. Because transient ischaemic episodes during early and late ambulatory monitoring have dissimilar characteristics they may also have different pathophysiologies and prognostic implications. 
1	Temporal bone: three-dimensional CT. Part II. Pathologic alterations. Three-dimensional (3D) surface renderings were obtained from routine axial computed tomographic (CT) images in 15 patients with a variety of complex temporal bone abnormalities. The 3D CT reformations served as an adjunct to conventional sectional CT examination. While no diagnosis was substantially changed because of the 3D CT images, they did provide a more global perspective in cases of large tumors and fractures and at the postmastoidectomy site. Three-dimensional CT surface reformations are now practical and may be potentially useful for visualizing temporal bone lesions characterized by complex destructive change. 
5	Clinical and manometric aspects of diffuse esophageal spasm in a cohort of subjects evaluated for dysphagia and/or chest pain. Manometric criteria for diffuse esophageal spasm have recently been restated. In this study, a cohort of 358 subjects was evaluated in a gastrointestinal motility laboratory for dysphagia and/or chest pain. Applying the recently proposed criteria of Richter and Castell, 18 subjects (5%) were diagnosed as having DES. Dysphagia was the major complaint (89%), while 44% of patients complained of chest pain and 33% of both symptoms. All patients shared more than 30% simultaneous contractions after wet swallows interspersed with normal peristaltic sequences. Associated manometric findings were repetitive (greater than 3 peaks) contractions (67%), high-amplitude contractions (33%), spontaneous activity (22%), prolonged duration (11%), and lower esophageal sphincter abnormalities (5%). Radiology disclosed significant abnormalities in only 27% of DES patients. 
1	Clinical evaluation of interferons in malignant melanoma. The evaluation of interferons in the treatment of malignant melanoma has been mainly in the treatment of advanced disease using interferons as the sole agent or in combination with other agents. Studies of the value of interferons as adjuvant therapy in high-risk primary melanoma patients are necessary, but no results have been published to date. Human interferon alpha produces low response rates as a sole agent, but in combination with cimetidine, a 30% response rate has been achieved. Recombinant alpha interferons give responses of 15%-20% in advanced melanomas, and combination with cimetidine does not enhance the response rate. Recombinant alpha interferons have been used in combination with other interferons, cimetidine, monoclonal antibodies, and cytotoxics, with either no or small improvement in response rates. DTIC with recombinant interferon alpha-2a has been shown to produce objective response rates of 26%, with low toxicity and maintenance of quality of life. A randomized trial with DTIC as the sole agent, compared with combination treatment, is being conducted to determine the significance of this finding. 
5	Neurogenic inflammation of the rat trachea: fate of neutrophils that adhere to venules. The goal of this study was to determine whether neutrophils that adhere to the vascular endothelium in association with neurogenic inflammation in the respiratory tract migrate out of the blood vessels or whether they detach and reenter the circulation. We also sought to determine whether the fate of the neutrophils is influenced by neutral endopeptidase (NEP), an enzyme that degrades the tachykinins that produce neurogenic inflammation. Neutrophils in the tracheal mucosa of anesthetized pathogen-free rats were examined 5 min or 4 h after neurogenic inflammation was produced by an injection of capsaicin (100 or 200 micrograms/kg iv). In whole mounts of these tracheae stained histochemically for myeloperoxidase, adherent intravascular neutrophils had a spherical or teardrop (regular) shape and migrating neutrophils had a polarized amoeboid (irregular) shape. The number of regular neutrophils in the tracheae was increased at both times, but the increase at 4 h was only half that present at 5 min. The reduction between 5 min and 4 h was not offset by an appreciable increase in the number of irregular neutrophils, unless NEP was inhibited by phosphoramidon. We interpret these results as indicating that the rapid adherence of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium after an injection of capsaicin is followed by a gradual reentry of the neutrophils into the circulation and comparatively little neutrophil migration. However, when the effect of the stimulus is increased and/or prolonged by inhibition of NEP, some of the adherent neutrophils migrate out of the vessels. Thus the activity of NEP can regulate both the magnitude of the neutrophil adherence and the fate of the adherent cells. 
5	Intestinal metaplasia is age related in Barrett's esophagus. The correlation among cellular characteristics of Barrett's esophagus, patient age, and malignant neoplasm is not well documented. This study, which describes a population of 66 patients with Barrett's esophagus spanning 1 to 80 years of age, analyzes the cellular constituents of their lesional tissues by endoscopic biopsy and histochemical and morphometric studies. Goblet cell metaplasia, identified in 50% (n = 14) of pediatric patients, increased significantly to involve 84% (n = 32) of biopsy specimens from adult patients with Barrett's esophagus. This increase was exponential by linear regression analysis (R2 = .64) between the ages of 5 and 29 years. Pediatric patients usually had 25 or less goblet cells per square millimeter of Barrett mucosa with no identifiable epithelial dysplasia or cancer; Nissen fundoplication lessened esophageal inflammation, but the Barrett mucosa persisted. Goblet cell metaplasia maintained a plateau (mean of 57 cells per square millimeter of Barrett mucosa) between the ages of 41 and 80 years. Dysplasia, in situ carcinoma, or invasive carcinoma was found in patients with Barrett's esophagus who were aged 41 years or older. This study demonstrates persistence of Barrett mucosa, increased incidence of goblet cell metaplasia, and predictable changes in goblet cell number with advancing patient age. The relationship between Barrett mucosa and malignant neoplasm remains uncertain, but the goblet cell may serve as a marker of disease chronicity in which setting neoplasia evolves. 
2	Gastric outlet obstruction caused by traumatic pseudoaneurysm of superior mesenteric artery. Traumatic pseudoaneurysms of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) are extremely rare. We describe two cases of posttraumatic proximal SMA pseudoaneurysms with symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction. Repair was accomplished by aorta-SMA bypass with saphenous vein. Injuries to the proximal SMA are easily missed at laparotomy, especially if intestinal ischemia or hematomas are absent. Recognition and repair are stressed to avoid the complications associated with pseudoaneurysm formation. 
4	Changes in myocardial ischemic threshold during daily activities. This study assesses the variations in myocardial ischemic threshold (heart rate at the onset of ischemia) during daily activities in patients with ischemic episodes on Holter monitoring. Eighty patients with known coronary artery disease, positive treadmill stress test results and greater than or equal to 2 ischemic episodes during a 24-hour period of Holter monitoring were studied. The lowest and the highest ischemic thresholds were determined for each patient. The mean lowest ischemic threshold was 85 beats/min, and the mean highest ischemic threshold was 109 beats/min. The highest ischemic threshold was identical to ischemic threshold values noted during exercise. Of the 895 ischemic episodes, 654 (74%) were preceded by a moderate (greater than 10%) increase in heart rate. The variability of ischemic threshold (difference in percentage between the highest and lowest ischemic thresholds) increased with the number of ischemic episodes (range 2 to 60%). However, in different patients with a similar number of ischemic episodes, different variability was observed. These differences in ischemic thresholds are probably indirect indicators of the vasomotor activity of the coronary arteries in different patients. 
1	Metastatic ciliary body carcinoid tumor. A 50-year-old man with a history of systemic carcinoid had decreased right eye vision and a darkly pigmented cilio-choroidal mass. Results of ultrasonographic and fluorescein angiographic examinations were consistent with a malignant melanoma. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lesion identified it as a carcinoid metastasis. The patient refused both radiation and enucleation; complete excision with a cyclochoroidectomy was performed. Histopathologic examination showed a carcinoid neoplasm covered by marked hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium that produced the pigmented appearance of the lesion. 
4	Cholesterol and coronary heart disease. Future directions. The importance of high serum cholesterol levels as a risk factor for coronary heart disease and the benefit of lowering cholesterol levels for reducing risk are being increasingly accepted. A broad consensus to this effect has led to the establishment of the National Cholesterol Education Program. Although the available evidence fully justifies this program, its practical application to the American public has generated a series of new questions that must be explored. For example, it can be questioned whether reduction in coronary risk through lowering cholesterol levels extends to both sexes and all age groups. For people with high cholesterol levels, dietary modification is undoubtedly the first step of management, but the fraction of people responding adequately to dietary change remains to be determined. Finally, indications for drug therapy and choice of drugs need further exploration, particularly in the area of cost vs benefit. Thus, continuing research must be carried out in parallel with clinical and public health application of cholesterol education. 
3	Efficacy of methylphenidate among mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Twelve children with IQ scores of 50 to 74 (educable mental retardation) who met rigorous diagnostic criteria for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder participated in a double-blind crossover study of the efficacy of two doses of methylphenidate compared with placebo. Dependent measures included behavioral ratings, classroom work output, laboratory measures of attention and learning, and direct observations of social behavior. Improvement with medication on the Conners Hyperactivity Index was observed in 75% of subjects. Significant increases in work output, on-task behavior, and attentional skills were associated with methylphenidate. However, gains in measures of attention were not associated with improvement in learning, as measured by a paired associate learning task. Additionally, no significant increases in appropriate social interactions during free play were associated with methylphenidate. The results suggest that mentally retarded children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder respond to methylphenidate at similar rates and in similar domains to that of the nonretarded population. 
2	Drug-induced colonic pseudo-obstruction. Report of a case. Colonic pseudo-obstruction may have many possible causes. Some of these are well described and pose no diagnostic problems. Drug-related colonic pseudo-obstruction remains underreported, but is of importance in modern society where drugs are endemically abused. This case highlights the importance of drugs in altering colonic motility and emphasizes the nonsurgical management of this condition. 
1	Continuous 5-fluorouracil infusion and alpha interferon in advanced cancers: a report of initial treatment results. Twenty-four patients with advanced metastatic cancer were treated with continuous intravenous 5-fluorouracil infusion 200-300 mg/m2/day and alpha interferon 3 million units subcutaneously 3 times per week. The average duration of treatment was 87 days (range 22-204 days). 5-fluorouracil could be infused 66% of the planned time on treatment, and patients received an average of 60% of the planned interferon injections. Objective tumor responses were seen in 6 of 17 previously untreated patients (35%). Twenty-two of the 24 patients (92%) experienced toxicity (greater than or equal to ECOG grade II) that required treatment interruption and subsequent dose reduction predominantly for the following reasons: mucositis (67%), hand-foot syndrome (21%), and leukopenia (25%). The incidence of treatment limiting toxicity is higher than previously observed with 5-fluorouracil infusion alone. This suggests true augmentation of 5-fluorouracil effect by interferon. 5-Fluorouracil infusion and alpha interferon is a potentially useful combination that needs further evaluation in future phase II and phase III trials. 
1	Effects of hypovolemia and transfusion on tumor growth in MCA-tumor-bearing rats. Pretransplant blood transfusion has been shown to significantly affect the outcome of renal transplantation. Evidence regarding the association of blood transfusions with growth or recurrence of solid tumors is still conflicting both in clinical and in experimental studies, although diminished survival has been suggested in several studies. To determine the influence of blood transfusions and hypovolemia, as separate or combined factors, on tumor growth, we evaluated the weight of a subcutaneously implanted sarcoma (methylcholanthrene-induced) in 35 rats. After reaching 1% tumor burden (day 0), the animals were separated into two groups: hypovolemia (shed volume, 15 ml/kg) or normovolemia. These groups were further divided according to resuscitation: OO (no resuscitation), BL (receiving syngeneic blood stored in citrate phosphate dextrose for 4 days, 15 ml/kg), SL (receiving 0.9% sodium chloride, 45 ml/kg). Tumor dimensions were determined daily by external measurement, and tumor weight was calculated. Hypovolemia exerted a significant influence on tumor growth, independent of the resuscitation modality. The rats that received blood transfusions showed an increased rate of tumor growth, compared to the animals that received saline solution or no treatment. No interaction was noted between the effects produced by hypovolemia and blood transfusion. We conclude that the hypovolemic event enhanced tumor growth independently of the resuscitation, and transfusion of citrate phosphate dextrose-blood stored for 4 days did influence tumor growth in this model. We suggest that the effect of blood transfusion in patients with cancer has to be redefined to account for the influence of possible hypovolemic events. 
5	Susceptibility to invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b disease and the immunoglobulin G2m(n) allotype. There has been considerable controversy about the role of the immunoglobulin G2m(n) allotype and risk of invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease. This allotype was studied in a large cohort of Finnish children (178) with invasive Hib disease. The G2m(n) allotype distribution was similar to that in the normal white Finnish population. No increased risk of Hib disease could be associated with the n-/n- genotype [i.e., lack of G2m(n) allotype]. Thus, the G2m(n) allotype does not seem to be a major determinant of susceptibility to Hib infection among white populations in industrialized countries. 
1	Interleukin-2 immunotherapy in children. Immunotherapy with interleukin (IL)-2 possesses great potential in the treatment of immune-mediated diseases and cancers. However, only a few reports on a small number of children have appeared in the literature. From March 1988 to March 1989, 11 children and adolescents were treated with IL-2. They included 1 patient with hepatocellular carcinoma, 1 with hepatoblastoma, 6 with childhood atopic dermatitis, and 3 with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The dosages ranged from 10,000 to 50,000 U/kg every 8 hours by intravenous drip. The following side effects were observed: anorexia, fever, and chillness (100%), general malaise (82%), irritability (64%), diarrhea (100%), nausea and vomiting (73%), weight gain (82%), edema (82%), abdominal distension (73%), oliguria (82%), cough (91%), dyspnea (27%), pleural effusion (40%), hypotension (82%), skin eruption (82%), oral ulcer (18%), enlarged liver (73%) liver function abnormalities (82%), renal function impairment (36%), electrolyte imbalance (73%), anemia (91%), thrombocytopenia (54%), leukopenia (18%), and eosinophilia (73%). Immunologically, numbers of natural killer cells were increased and natural killer and lymphokine-activated killer cell activities were augmented after IL-2 treatment. There was a tendency for serum levels of IL-2 and receptor IL-2 to decrease, especially in patients with atopic eczema. Ten patients (91%) completed one course (9 to 12 days) of therapy, and the remaining patient interrupted the treatment because of intolerable adverse effects. Clinically, complete remission for 3 months was obtained in 1 juvenile rheumatoid arthritis patient, transient improvement (2 to 6 weeks) in all atopic dermatitis patients, minor response in the hepatoblastoma patient, and no response in the patient with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
1	CD11c (LEU-M5) expression characterizes a B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorder with features of both chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) are two common chronic lymphoproliferative disorders, each having characteristic clinical, morphologic, and immunologic features. Phenotypically, CD5 reactivity in CLL and CD11c (Leu-M5) reactivity in HCL have characterized these two leukemias among B-cell disorders. In this study, we report 14 cases of a novel chronic lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by lymphocytosis and CD11c expression, but morphologically similar to CLL. The patients' ages ranged from 46 to 81 years (median 62). Eleven had palpable splenomegaly, five with markedly enlarged spleens; only one patient had generalized lymphadenopathy. The white blood cell count ranged from 5.2 to 131.0 x 10(9)/L (median 20.8). The morphologic diagnosis in all cases was CLL, with the cells usually having abundant cytoplasm. No morphologic features, of hairy cells were evident; tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase cytochemistry was negative in all cases. Bone marrow biopsies were available in 8 of 14. Four showed focal nodular infiltrates and two had diffuse infiltrates similar to CLL; two showed only minimal interstitial involvement. All cases expressed multiple B-cell markers, and 12 of 14 had monoclonal surface immunoglobulin. The leukemic cells of all cases strongly expressed CD11c, while CD5 was expressed in 7 of 14; only 1 of the 14 cases expressed the lymph node homing receptor, Leu-8. This unique group of leukemias appears to represent the malignant transformation of lymphocytes arising from a stage of lymphocyte differentiation between that found in typical cases of CLL and that of HCL. CD11c is known to have an important function in cellular adhesion and may be important in determining the pattern of lymphocyte tissue distribution found in this group of patients. 
4	Comparison of left ventricular ejection fraction by magnetic resonance imaging and radionuclide ventriculography in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. To assess the validity of gated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in determining left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF), MRI (Spin Echo, multislice-multiphase technique on the short-axis plane) was compared with equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography in 32 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. All patients underwent MRI and radionuclide ventriculography, performed consecutively on the same day (mean time interval between the 2 examinations: 40 minutes). Comparison with LVEF showed a high correlation (y = 0.79 X +3.51, r = 0.91; p less than 0.001). Mean difference between radionuclide ventriculography and MRI data was 1.7, with the 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 2.68: MRI slightly underestimated LVEF. MRI interobserver and intrapatient variability (assessed in 15 of 32 patients) showed a high correlation (r = 0.91, r = 0.98). In conclusion, data suggest that MRI, using the short-axis approach and the multislice-multiphase technique, is an accurate, noninvasive, highly reproducible method of evaluating LVEF in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. 
3	Ocular defects in infants of extremely low birth weight and low gestational age. The eyes of 49 babies who weighed less than 1,000 g at birth or who were born at or before 28 weeks gestation were examined at the age of 4 years. Twenty-one children were normal. The remaining 29 children (59%) had ocular abnormalities which ranged from mild amblyopia to blindness from retinopathy of prematurity. The need to examine children at risk is stressed. 
5	Coronary vascular remodeling and myocardial fibrosis in the rat with renovascular hypertension. Response to captopril. Progressive myocardial fibrosis, including the accumulation of collagen within the adventitia of intramyocardial coronary arteries, is seen in the hypertrophied rat myocardium secondary to renovascular hypertension (RHT) and has been held responsible for alterations in myocardial diastolic stiffness. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that this presumptive angiotensin-aldosterone mediated fibrosis and its functional consequences could be favorably altered by an antihypertensive oral dose (50 mg/kg/day) of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril. Three groups were studied: control; untreated RHT for 8 weeks; treated RHT, with captopril started 48 h before banding and continued for 8 weeks. Interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen area (morphometry), the fibrillar nature of collagen (picrosirius polarization), and the end diastolic stress-strain relation of the intact left ventricle were examined in each group. In comparison to untreated animals with RHT, we found that captopril, begun prior to banding, attenuated interstitial and perivascular fibrosis and prevented hypertrophy and the rise in diastolic stiffness 8 weeks later. Thus, an adverse accumulation of collagen in the interstitium and around intramyocardial coronary arteries, and its functional consequences in the rat with RHT, can be prevented by captopril. Other ACE inhibitors may have similar salutary effects, but remain to be evaluated. The pathogenetic origin of myocardial fibrosis in RHT requires further investigation, but appears to be related to the angiotensin-aldosterone system. 
4	Tolerance to organic nitrates: evidence, mechanisms, clinical relevance, and strategies for prevention. OBJECTIVE: To review the available information about nitrate tolerance, its potential mechanisms, clinical implications, and strategies for prevention. DATA IDENTIFICATION: A survey of the National Library of Medicine MEDLINE database and bibliographies of the reviewed articles. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies were selected from the English language literature with an emphasis on recent studies and, when available, randomized placebo-controlled studies. Old studies were selected on the basis of their historical value and originality. A total of 134 retrieved articles were considered relevant and were reviewed in depth. RESULTS: The available information about the experimental as well as the clinical evidence for tolerance to organic nitrates has been summarized. In addition, information related to potential mechanisms, clinical implications, and possible methods for prevention have been reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence indicates that prolonged in-vitro exposure to organic nitrates, continuous intravenous or topical administration of nitrates, and frequent in-vivo oral dosing result in the rapid development of tolerance to the peripheral as well as to the coronary vasodilatory effects of the drugs. This phenomenon leads to the rapid attenuation of the hemodynamic and anti-ischemic effects of nitrates in patients with ischemic heart disease or congestive heart failure, or both. Tolerance development seems to be dose- and time-dependent, and its main mechanism seems to be a depletion of sulfhydryl groups at the vascular cell. Although the repletion of sulfhydryl groups with the use of sulfhydryl-containing drugs may help to prevent tolerance, the efficacy and safety of this approach requires further evaluation. Intermittent therapy allowing a sufficiently long, daily nitrate-washout interval seems to be the most effective and the most safe strategy currently available for the prevention of nitrate tolerance. 
5	Pilot study of nicardipine for acute ischemic stroke. The author performed a pilot study of nicardipine (NC), a Ca(+)+ channel blocker, to study its dosing, toxicity, and possible efficacy for hemispheric cerebral infarction within 12 hours (mean 6.9 hr) of onset to determine the advisability of proceeding with a multi-centered controlled trial. NC was administered IV (3 to 7 mg/hr) X 72 hours by titrating dose to mean arterial blood pressure (MABP not less than 10% of baseline), then orally X 30 days. Forty-three patients have been entered; mean age 63 (range 34-89), 25 male and 18 female. Only 3 had CT evidence of infarct on entry. Results have shown improvement in a 100-point (pt) graded exam (40 pts at entry, 68 pts at 3 months). Of 20 patients completing 3 months' evaluation, 17 improved and none worsened. Sixteen out of 20 were at home and 8 had minimal or no impairment. Mean Barthel's index was 72. Mean maximal serum NC level was 75 ng/mL. MABP decreased from 103 (entry) to 83 (72 hours). A larger controlled study is warranted to determine the efficacy of NC for acute cerebral infarct. 
4	Transesophageal Doppler echocardiography evaluation of coronary blood flow velocity in baseline conditions and during dipyridamole-induced coronary vasodilation Transesophageal echocardiography allows the evaluation of proximal coronary artery anatomy and coronary blood flow velocity (CBFV). To assess the potential of transesophageal echocardiography in evaluating CBFV and its variations induced by coronary-active drugs, we studied 15 patients by high-quality pulsed wave Doppler recordings of CBFV. In these patients, transesophageal Doppler evaluation of CBFV was performed before, 2 minutes after cessation of dipyridamole infusion (0.56 mg/kg in 4 minutes), and 2 minutes after aminophylline infusion (240 mg injected 4 minutes after cessation of dipyridamole infusion). The following CBFV parameters were evaluated at each of the three steps of the study protocol: maximal and mean diastolic velocities and maximal and mean systolic velocities. Furthermore, the following indexes of coronary flow reserve were evaluated: the ratio between maximal diastolic velocity recorded after and before dipyridamole administration and the ratio between mean diastolic velocity recorded after and before dipyridamole administration. Nine of the 15 patients had a normal left anterior descending coronary artery (group A), whereas the remaining six had significant (less than or equal to 75%) stenosis (group B). In group A patients, all CBFV parameters increased significantly during dipyridamole infusion and returned to near baseline values after aminophylline infusion. In group B patients, on the other hand, none of the CBFV parameters increased after dipyridamole infusion. Dipyridamole/baseline maximal diastolic velocity and mean diastolic velocity ratios were, respectively, 3.22 +/- 0.96 and 3.04 +/- 0.88 in group A and 1.46 +/- 0.45 (p less than 0.01 versus group A) and 1.48 +/- 0.49 (p less than 0.01 versus group A) in group B patients. 
5	Reversal of chronic hepatic encephalopathy by colonic exclusion: poor correlation with blood GABA levels. Previous studies have suggested that the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a key factor in the syndrome of portasystemic encephalopathy. We report the case of a patient with medically intractable portasytemic encephalopathy after portacaval shunt who had marked clinical improvement after creation of an end ileostomy. Plasma GABA and serum ammonia levels were measured before and after ileostomy. Although the clinical syndrome and the EEG improved markedly after the ileostomy, the plasma GABA levels remained markedly elevated. Preoperative and postoperative GABA levels were 865 and 633 pmol/ml, respectively (nl = 100-180 pmol/ml). Our findings confirm previous reports of the efficacy of colonic exclusion in patients with intractable portasystemic encephalopathy. However, our results conflict with the hypothesis that GABA itself is the key mediator of the syndrome. 
2	Importance of the omentum in the development of intra-abdominal metastases. Areas of trauma are preferred sites for metastatic tumour growth. In extensive intra-abdominal tumour recurrence the omentum is invariably involved. The importance of the omentum in the development of tumours at sites of intra-abdominal trauma has been investigated. Colonic anastomoses were performed in Hooded-Lister rats with and without omentectomy. Animals received intraluminal or intraperitoneal injections of a syngeneic tumour. With intraluminal injection, tumour occurred at the anastomosis and in the omentum in 38 and 43 per cent of animals respectively but following omentectomy the values were 14 and 9 per cent (omental remnant). With intraperitoneal administration tumour occurred in 53 per cent at the anastomosis and in 79 per cent in the omentum compared with 16 and 29 per cent (in omental remnant) following omentectomy. In this model a reduced ability of an anastomosis to support 'seeded' tumour following removal of the omentum is demonstrated and the development of local recurrence from spilled tumour cells during operation may be enhanced by, or be dependent on, the proximity of the omentum. 
1	Vagal schwannoma associated with syncopal attacks and postural hypotension: a case report. A case of vagal schwannoma in the cerebellomedullary angle is reported. Preoperatively, the patient had paroxysmal episodes of postural hypotension with syncope. After total removal of the vagal tumor, her systemic blood pressure returned to normal. 
5	A comparison of neurological, metabolic, structural, and genetic evaluations in persons at risk for Huntington's disease. We compared four diagnostic data sets for the assessment of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease. Fifty-four chorea-free persons were evaluated by neurological examination, positron emission tomography measurement of glucose metabolism, radiographic computerized tomographic measurement of caudate size, and genetic testing at the polymorphic DNA loci D4S10, D4S43, and D4S125. Twelve (22%) persons had abnormal caudate metabolism, 6 (11%) had subtle abnormalities of motor control, and 7 (13%) had computed tomographic evidence of caudate atrophy, compared with an expected gene frequency of 34% for this population. In 20 persons with unambiguous genetic test results or the subsequent phenotypic expression of Huntington's disease (chorea), there was a greater sensitivity of the positron emission tomographic measurement of caudate metabolism (75%) relative to computed tomography (33%) or the clinical examination (17%) for the determination of a subpopulation of probable Huntington's disease gene carriers. Hypometabolism of the putamen and globus pallidus, and hypermetabolism of the precentral gyrus were also associated with a high probability of carrying the Huntington's disease gene. The findings support the hypothesis that abnormalities of cerebral metabolism precede clinical or structural (computed tomographic) abnormalities in gene-positive individuals at risk for Huntington's disease. 
5	The perineal artificial sphincter for acquired incontinence--a cut and dried solution? Sixteen males with stress incontinence due to sphincter damage were investigated with videourodynamic studies after implantation of a perineal artificial urinary sphincter. Twelve patients were rendered dry; 4 remained incontinent, all of whom were shown by cystometry to have incontinence from detrusor instability. Of these, 2 also had stress incontinence proven by videourography. Detrusor instability was present in 9 patients before implantation; the instability worsened considerably in 2 patients and new instability was shown in another 2 patients. The limitations of the artificial urinary sphincter and the implications of detrusor instability in patients with an artificial sphincter are discussed. The artificial urinary sphincter is an extremely successful device for the treatment of acquired stress incontinence. 
4	Response of angiographically normal and atherosclerotic left anterior descending coronary arteries to acetylcholine. Acetylcholine-induced constriction of human coronary arteries in vivo is commonly attributed to endothelial dysfunction. To examine the effects of 2 other important determinants of vascular responses--namely, agonist concentration and the segment of circulation under study--the diameters of proximal, middle and distal segments of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) and coronary sinus oxygen saturation were measured in 10 patients with angiographically normal coronary arteries (group 1) and in 7 patients with coronary atherosclerosis (group 2) after intracoronary acetylcholine was infused at concentrations from 10(-7)M to between 10(-4)M and 10(-2)M. In group 1, acetylcholine caused minor (less than or equal to 6%) but progressive dilatation of the LAD up to 10(-4)M, but constriction, particularly of the distal segments and tertiary branches, occurred at higher concentrations. Over the same concentration range, coronary sinus oxygen saturation rose progressively from a basal level of 36 +/- 3% to a maximum of 72 +/- 3% in the absence of changes in heart rate and blood pressure, suggesting marked progressive dilatation of resistance vessels. Concentrations greater than or equal to 10(-3)M caused intense constriction of distal epicardial vessels and, in some cases, anginal pain and objective signs of ischemia. Conversely, in group 2, acetylcholine (infused only up to 10(-4)M for ethical reasons) failed to cause significant changes in LAD diameter. These data suggest that the local acetylcholine concentration and coronary vascular segment under study may determine the observed response to at least an equivalent extent as does the presence or absence of coronary atherosclerosis, raising the question of whether a constrictor response to intracoronary acetylcholine reliably indicates the presence of coronary atherosclerosis. 
4	Hirudin interruption of heparin-resistant arterial thrombus formation in baboons. To determine the role of thrombin in high blood flow, platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes we measured the relative antithrombotic and antihemostatic effects in baboons of hirudin, a highly potent and specific antithrombin, and compared the effects of heparin, an antithrombin III-dependent inhibitor of thrombin. Thrombus formation was determined in vivo using three relevant models (homologous endarterectomized aorta, collagen-coated tubing, and Dacron vascular graft) by measuring: (1) platelet deposition, using gamma camera imaging of 111In-platelets; (2) fibrin deposition, as assessed by the incorporation of circulating 125I-fibrinogen; and (3) occlusion. The continuous intravenous infusion of 1, 5, and 20 nmol/kg per minute of recombinant hirudin (desulfatohirudin) maintained constant plasma levels of 0.16 +/- 0.03, 0.79 +/- 0.44, and 3.3 +/- 0.77 mumol/mL, respectively. Hirudin interrupted platelet and fibrin deposition in a dose-dependent manner that was profound at the highest dose for all three thrombogenic surfaces and significant at the lowest dose for thrombus formation on endarterectomized aorta. Thrombotic occlusion was prevented by all doses studied. In contrast, heparin did not inhibit either platelet or fibrin deposition when administered at a dose that maximally prolonged clotting times (100 U/kg) (P greater than .1), and only intermediate effects were produced at 10-fold that dose (1,000 U/kg). Moreover, heparin did not prevent occlusion of the test segments. Hirudin inhibited platelet hemostatic function in concert with its antithrombotic effects (bleeding times were prolonged by the intermediate and higher doses). By comparison, intravenous heparin failed to affect the bleeding time at the 100 U/kg dose (P greater than .5), and only minimally prolonged the bleeding time at the 1,000 U/kg dose (P less than .05). We conclude that platelet-dependent thrombotic and hemostatic processes are thrombin-mediated and that the biologic antithrombin hirudin produces a potent, dose-dependent inhibition of arterial thrombus formation that greatly exceeds the minimal antithrombotic effects produced by heparin. 
2	Fluorescence assays to monitor membrane fusion: potential application in biliary lipid secretion and vesicle interactions. Membrane fusion constitutes an essential, intermediate step in numerous cell biological processes, occurring for example during endocytosis, membrane recycling and exocytosis. Also less desirable events such as the infection of cells by animal viruses are mediated by membrane fusion during which the viral envelope merges with a cellular membrane, causing the expulsion of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm of the cell as an initial step in virus replication. Much of our current knowledge concerning the mechanism of membrane fusion has been derived from studies using simple artificial membranes, such as liposomes or phospholipid vesicles, as model systems. A most essential feature of these studies has been the development of membrane fusion assays that register in a sensitive and continuous fashion the mixing of membranes or the aqueous volumes initially enclosed by these membranes. Not only do these assays allow one to readily detect and quantify fusion, but they also provide the possibility to relate the kinetics of fusion to the rate by which certain molecular changes in membranes take place. Obviously, this insight is of relevance for understanding the mechanism of membrane fusion. The principles and applications of some representative assays that rely on the use of fluorescence spectroscopy will be discussed. Assays that monitor membrane mixing are commonly based on the detection of changes in resonance energy transfer efficiency or the relief of fluorescence self-quenching of appropriate fluorescent lipid analogs. Contents mixing assays rely on either the formation of a (aqueous-soluble) fluorescent complex or quenching of a fluorophore, encapsulated in one vesicle population, by a suitable quencher, entrapped in a second population. 
3	Angiotropic intravascular large-cell lymphoma (malignant angioendotheliomatosis): report of a case and review of the literature. We present a case of angiotropic large-cell lymphoma and review the literature in order to define the neurologic features of this rare disorder. This is the first report of gadolinium-DTPA imaging in angiotropic large-cell lymphoma that demonstrates infarcts of multiple ages, as well as striking meningeal enhancement. Angiotropic large-cell lymphoma should be suspected in patients with clinical evidence of small and large cerebral vessel disease and diagnosis requires skin, liver, renal, meningeal, or brain biopsy. Single modality treatment, using either radiation therapy or steroids, has been ineffective, and new findings of a lymphomatous origin of this neoplasm suggest that combination chemotherapy may be indicated. 
5	Long-term follow-up of patients operated on for recurrent carotid stenosis. We reviewed our experience with 29 operations for recurrent carotid stenosis in 27 patients who underwent both their primary carotid endarterectomy and their reoperations at our institution. These 27 patients represent 4% of the 667 patients who underwent primary carotid endarterectomies at our institution and who are included in our carotid follow-up registry. Reoperation was prompted by recurrent symptoms in 19/29 (65.5%) cases. Comparison of long-term stroke prevention in those patients who did (84% at 5 years, 78.6% at 10 years) and did not (90.3% at 5 years, 83.6% at 10 years) develop recurrent stenosis requiring reoperation revealed no statistically significant difference (p = 0.48) when measured from the time of primary operation. The perioperative stroke and death rates for reoperation (3.4% and 0%) were acceptable. We conclude that with our acceptably low perioperative stroke morbidity (3.4%), surgery for recurrent carotid stenosis in symptomatic patients or in asymptomatic patients with high-grade (greater than or equal to 75%) stenosis maintains the durable stroke prevention offered by primary carotid endarterectomy. 
5	Brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic evaluation of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. We compared brain magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychologic performance in 20 neurologically asymptomatic patients suffering from idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (mean age 41 [range 18-49] years) and 20 age-matched controls (mean age 38 [range 28-49] years). Patients exhibited a significantly higher rate of cerebral infarcts (20% versus 0%, p less than 0.05) and cortical (50% versus 5%, p less than 0.01) and ventricular (55% versus 15%, p less than 0.02) atrophy than controls. Accordingly, semiquantitative volumetric measurements yielded a significantly increased ventricular-to-intracranial cavity ratio in the patients (6.2 +/- 2.9% versus 4.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.01). This ratio and the cortical atrophy ratings correlated positively with disease duration (r = 0.63 and 0.54, p less than 0.05). Cognitive test performance was significantly worse in patients than in controls and was most impaired in those patients with morphologic cerebral abnormalities. 
3	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with L-tryptophan use. The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with the use of oral preparations of the amino acid L-tryptophan was recognized in late 1989. We describe the clinical and laboratory manifestations, pathological findings and early clinical course of 20 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Prominent clinical findings included severe myalgias limiting function, fatigue, rashes, edema and weight gain, weight loss, muscle weakness and shortness of breath. Laboratory findings included eosinophilia (often marked), normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated aldolase with normal or low creatine kinase values. On biopsy fascial inflammation was always seen consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes and eosinophils in a perivascular distribution. Invasion of the vascular wall by lymphocytes was seen in 20%. Capillary and arteriolar endothelial cell thickening was found in most cases on electron microscopy and endothelial cell necrosis or mural invasion by lymphocytes was seen in 25% of cases. Two patients improved with no therapy. Ten patients responded to therapy with prednisone alone. Three patients have had progressive disease and one of these died. The relationship of this syndrome to previously described disease entities associated with eosinophilia is discussed. 
2	Aspiration in bilateral stroke patients. Seventy patients with bilateral strokes underwent neurologic and videofluoroscopic barium swallowing examinations; 34 (48.6%) aspirated. Patients with aspiration were more likely to have posterior circulation strokes, abnormal cough, abnormal gag, and dysphonia. However, patients likely to aspirate can be identified best by the presence of an abnormal voluntary cough, an abnormal gag reflex, or both. The prediction of patients at risk for aspiration was not improved by additional clinical information (ie, presence of dysphonia or bilateral neurologic signs). 
5	The lateral approach for operative release of post-traumatic contracture of the elbow. A lateral approach was used to release a post-traumatic contracture of the elbow in seven patients, and the results were evaluated an average of thirty-eight months postoperatively. Extension improved from an average flexion contracture of 45 degrees preoperatively to one of 12 degrees postoperatively, and the average point of maximum flexion increased from 116 degrees preoperatively to 129 degrees postoperatively. The average arc of motion increased 46 degrees. All patients began using a continuous-passive-motion device immediately after the operation. There were no problems with wound-healing or formation of heterotopic bone. 
5	Identification of three related human GRO genes encoding cytokine functions. The product of the human GRO gene is a cytokine with inflammatory and growth-regulatory properties; GRO is also called MGSA for melanoma growth-stimulatory activity. We have identified two additional genes, GRO beta and GRO gamma, that share 90% and 86% identity at the deduced amino acid level with the original GRO alpha isolate. One amino acid substitution of proline in GRO alpha by leucine in GRO beta and GRO gamma leads to a large predicted change in protein conformation. Significant differences also exist in the 3' untranslated region, including different numbers of ATTTA repeats associated with mRNA instability. A 122-base-pair region in the 3' region is conserved among the three GRO genes, and a part of it is also conserved in the Chinese hamster genome, suggesting a role in regulation. DNA hybridization with oligonucleotide probes and partial sequence analysis of the genomic clones confirm that the three forms are derived from related but different genes. Only one chromosomal locus has been identified, at 4q21, by using a GRO alpha cDNA clone that hybridized to all three genes. Expression studies reveal tissue-specific regulation as well as regulation by specific inducing agents, including interleukin 1, tumor necrosis factor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, and lipopolysaccharide. 
5	Histologic abnormalities of large and small coronary arteries, neural structures, and the conduction system of the heart found in postmortem studies of individuals dying from the toxic oil syndrome. Hundreds died and thousands were poisoned by rapeseed oil adulterated with aniline and sold illegally in Spain in 1981. The clinical manifestations, now known as the toxic oil syndrome, include pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy plus widespread vascular and neural lesions in other organs. Many of the late deaths ended with a scleroderma-like illness. Because scleroderma involves the heart, in this study we examined the small and large coronary arteries, neural structures, and conduction system from eight victims dying with the toxic oil syndrome. Dense fibrosis of the sinus node in two hearts resembled changes found in scleroderma. Atrionodal junctional hemorrhages and cystic degeneration of the sinus node present in the other six hearts resembled changes found in lupus erythematosus. Small and large coronary arteries exhibited focal fibromuscular dysplasia and a proliferative cystic myointimal degeneration. This latter abnormality was associated with sloughing of the inner wall and embolization of the detached fragment downstream in the same coronary artery. Every heart had many degenerative lesions within nerves, ganglia, and the coronary chemoreceptor. Both the arterial and neural abnormalities prominently involved the conduction system. Based upon observations by others with experimental feeding of rapeseed oil containing either high or low erucic acid, we suggest that this oil must remain a major suspected cause of the toxic oil syndrome, particularly in conjunction with some as yet unexplained facilitative influence by oleoanilids. If this is so, it is important to reconsider the widely recommended use of any rapeseed oil product as a suitable food for man or other animals. 
4	Plasma norepinephrine and dihydroxyphenylglycol in essential hypertension. The aim of the present study was to examine whether essential hypertension is associated with altered plasma concentrations of dihydroxyphenylglycol, the principal presynaptic metabolite of norepinephrine. Forearm venous plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol and norepinephrine were determined at rest and during graded orthostasis in 47 normotensive control subjects and 58 outpatients with essential hypertension. There was no group difference in age. At supine rest as well as during sitting and standing, hypertensive subjects had plasma norepinephrine concentrations similar to those in normotensive control subjects, but plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol concentrations were higher than those in normotensive control subjects. Both groups showed a linear relation between plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol (ordinate) and plasma norepinephrine (abscissa). The resulting regression line was steeper (p less than 0.02) and its ordinate intercept higher (p less than 0.01) in hypertensive than in control subjects. Eleven normotensive and 14 hypertensive subjects were also tested 3 hours after desipramine (1.5 mg/kg orally) was administered to inhibit neuronal norepinephrine reuptake. The drug did not alter plasma norepinephrine, but did reduce plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol and did abolish plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol responses to upright posture in both groups of subjects. The mean plasma dihydroxyphenylglycol concentration observed in the presence of desipramine again was higher in the hypertensive than in the control group (p less than 0.01) and closely agreed, in both groups, with the dihydroxyphenylglycol concentration given by the ordinate intercept of the dihydroxyphenylglycol versus norepinephrine regression line in the absence of desipramine. 
4	Duplex scanning of normal or minimally diseased carotid arteries: correlation with arteriography and clinical outcome. This study evaluated the role of duplex scanning in the management of patients with normal or minimally diseases carotid arteries. Carotid duplex scans were interpreted according to previously established criteria and considered normal when pulsed Doppler spectral waveforms showed laminar flow or only minor flow disturbances. Normal flow patterns were noted by duplex scanning in 100 carotid bifurcations of 72 patients who also underwent carotid arteriography. Neurologic symptoms (amaurosis fugax, transient ischemic attack, or stroke) were present in relation to 23 arteries and absent in relation to 77 arteries. On the 23 symptomatic sides arteriography was interpreted as normal in eight, 1% to 15% stenosis in 14, and 16% to 40% stenosis in one. For the 77 asymptomatic sides, arteriography showed normal vessels in 15, 1% to 15% stenosis in 43, and 16% to 40% stenosis in 19. One symptomatic patient was treated by carotid endarterectomy for an irregular 1% to 15% stenosis. None of the asymptomatic lesions were in the range of 80% to 99% stenosis, which would justify endarterectomy for asymptomatic disease. Clinical follow-up for a mean interval of 28 months on 20 of the 22 symptomatic patients not undergoing surgery revealed no strokes and transient recurrent symptoms in two patients. Assuming that the single operation in this study was indicated, duplex scanning correctly identified lesions not requiring carotid endarterectomy in 96% (22/23) of the symptomatic patients. A normal duplex scan also predicted a benign clinical outcome without operation. Duplex scanning can reliably exclude surgically treatable carotid bifurcation lesions in asymptomatic patients, and endarterectomy is rarely indicated in symptomatic patients with normal duplex scan results. This study supports a nonoperative therapeutic approach for most patients with neurologic symptoms and a normal carotid duplex scan on the appropriate side. 
5	Transsynaptic degeneration in the superficial dorsal horn after sciatic nerve injury: effects of a chronic constriction injury, transection, and strychnine. The lumbar and cervical spinal dorsal horns of adult rats with a chronic (8 days) constriction injury of the sciatic nerve on one side (and a sham operation on the other) were examined for signs of transsynaptic degeneration. The incidence of neurons with signs of degeneration (pyknosis and hyperchromatosis; 'dark neurons') was significantly increased in the lumbar dorsal horn on both sides. The ipsilateral lumbar increase was significantly greater than the contralateral increase. There was no increase in the incidence of dark neurons in the cervical dorsal horns of the same rats. The distribution of lumbar dark neurons was similar bilaterally. The majority of the dark neurons were found in the sciatic nerve's territory in laminae I-II. A second group of rats received the same surgery but in addition received a series of 7 daily subconvulsive doses of strychnine. Dark neurons were again found bilaterally (with ipsilateral predominance) in the sciatic nerve's territory in lumbar laminae I-II, but the incidence was significantly greater than that found in the group that did not receive strychnine. The same result was obtained in a third group of strychnine-treated rats when the sham operation was omitted. Thus the appearance of contralateral dark neurons is not dependent on unintentional nerve damage created by the sham procedure. An additional group of rats was sacrificed 8 days after receiving a unilateral sciatic nerve transection, a contralateral sham operation, and the 7 daily strychnine injections. There was no increase in the incidence of dark neurons in any of these rats. 
1	Correlations of acoustic tissue typing of malignant melanoma and histopathologic features as a predictor of death. Forty-six eyes with uveal melanoma were scanned with a computerized diagnostic ultrasound system before enucleation, and light microscope sections were obtained. Tumors were characterized by ultrasonically measured dimensions and power spectrum analysis, which provided information not available in conventional A- or B-scan ultrasonography. Histopathologic features, including cell clustering pattern, cell type, pigmentation, vascularity, and necrosis, were quantified. Statistically significant correlations were found between parameters derived from the power spectrum and histologic characteristics. Patients were followed up for up to ten years with 14 deaths occurring because of metastases. Using a Cox relative risk model with histopathologic data, a risk model comprising pigmentation and cell type (P less than .0001) was obtained. Using ultrasonic characteristics, a model comprising tumor volume and scatterer concentration (P = .0062) was obtained. The results suggest that ultrasonic tissue characterization and three-dimensional biometry may provide improved in vivo prognostic indicators for uveal melanoma. 
5	Muscle maximal O2 uptake at constant O2 delivery with and without CO in the blood. In the present study we investigated the effects of carboxyhemoglobinemia (HbCO) on muscle maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) during hypoxia. O2 uptake (VO2) was measured in isolated in situ canine gastrocnemius (n = 12) working maximally (isometric twitch contractions at 5 Hz for 3 min). The muscles were pump perfused at identical blood flow, arterial PO2 (PaO2) and total hemoglobin concentration [( Hb]) with blood containing either 1% (control) or 30% HbCO. In both conditions PaO2 was set at 30 Torr, which produced the same arterial O2 contents, and muscle blood flow was set at 120 ml.100 g-1.min-1, so that O2 delivery in both conditions was the same. To minimize CO diffusion into the tissues, perfusion with HbCO-containing blood was limited to the time of the contraction period. VO2max was 8.8 +/- 0.6 (SE) ml.min-1.100 g-1 (n = 12) with hypoxemia alone and was reduced by 26% to 6.5 +/- 0.4 ml.min-1.100 g-1 when HbCO was present (n = 12; P less than 0.01). In both cases, mean muscle effluent venous PO2 (PVO2) was the same (16 +/- 1 Torr). Because PaO2 and PVO2 were the same for both conditions, the mean capillary PO2 (estimate of mean O2 driving pressure) was probably not much different for the two conditions, even though the O2 dissociation curve was shifted to the left by HbCO. Consequently the blood-to-mitochondria O2 diffusive conductance was likely reduced by HbCO. 
2	In micronodular cirrhosis, hepatocytes retain a normal C-25 hydroxylation capacity toward vitamin D3: a study using the rat carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhotic model. To test further the competence of the cirrhotic liver to metabolize vitamin D3 at C-25, hepatocytes were isolated from controls and from CCl4-induced cirrhotic rat livers, as well as from partially hepatectomized rats. The transformation of D3 into 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 was studied in the presence of 10(7) hepatocytes at D3 concentrations of 20 nmol/L to 15.4 mumol/L. Histologically, micronodular cirrhosis was present in all CCl4-treated rats, whereas controls had normal livers; portal venous pressure (p less than 0.008) and intrahepatic collagen content (p less than 0.0001) were significantly increased in CCl4-treated rats, whereas no difference was found between the two groups in the total and ionized serum calcium, D3 metabolites, ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase. Cytochrome P-450 was 0.27 +/- 0.02 and 0.25 +/- 0.02 nmol/10(6) hepatocytes in controls and cirrhotic rats (N.S.), and it significantly increased in both groups after phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene administration (p less than 0.0001). 25-Hydroxyvitamin D3 formation was best described by power law equations and varied between 0.02 +/- 0.0004 and 29.57 +/- 2.8 in controls, and 0.024 +/- 0.0004 and 32.0 +/- 7.0 pmol.hr-1.10(6) hepatocytes-1 in cirrhotic rats. No statistically significant difference was found in the slopes of the 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 formation, but the y-axis intercept was found to be lower in cirrhotic rats under basal resting conditions (p less than 0.005). Inducers of the mixed function oxidases significantly increased 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 formation in controls as well as in cirrhotic rats (p less than 0.005). Moreover, both groups were found to respond similarly to the addition of modulators of the enzyme such as the calcium ionophore A23187 and parathyroid hormone. Partial hepatectomy was also without effect on the activation of D3. Furthermore, the cell sequestration of D3 was also found to be unperturbed in hepatocytes obtained from either cirrhotic or partially hepatectomized livers. The data indicate that in well-compensated micronodular cirrhosis, the C-25 hydroxylation of D3 is generally intrinsically normal at the cellular level and that it also remains fully responsive to in vivo and in vitro modulators of its activity. 
3	Centrifugal intensity and duration as countermeasures to soleus muscle atrophy. Mechanical acceleration is a countermeasure that may be employed to prevent atrophy of slow-twitch muscle during non-weight bearing. In the present study, daily centrifugation of rats for different durations (1 or 2 h) and at different gravitational intensities (1.5 or 2.6 G) was used to test whether mechanical acceleration could ameliorate the atrophy of the soleus muscle induced by non-weight bearing (tail-traction model). The soleus muscle atrophied 32% during 7 days of non-weight bearing without countermeasures. Centrifugation treatment did not completely prevent atrophy relative to precontrol wet weight of the soleus muscle. Non-weight-bearing groups receiving 2-h daily treatments of 1, 1.5, or 2.6 G had 48, 56, and 65%, respectively, of the atrophy observed in the non-weight-bearing-only group compared with the precontrol group. No evidence was obtained that centrifugation at 2.6 G was more effective than exposure to 1 or 1.5 G as a countermeasure to non-weight-bearing-induced atrophy of the soleus muscle. 
5	Palliative treatment of bile duct tumoral compression by an endoprosthesis: clinical results. The palliative therapy of stenoses of the biliary tract is a difficult choice. Because percutaneous or endoscopic drainage methods are fraught with complications, an endoprosthesis for surgical intubation of the biliary tract has been developed. Thirty patients were treated by this method. After choledochotomy, the endoprosthesis is positioned surgically above the sphincter of Oddi, thereby avoiding ascending cholangitis. Twenty-nine patients (13 with gallbladder cancer, 11 with cholangiocarcinomas, 5 with metastases) presented with neoplastic compression, and one patient had an early postoperative stricture with loss of substance after right hepatectomy for hepatic metastases. The operative mortality was 3.3% (one pulmonary complication). Resolution of jaundice was obtained in all but two patients, and pruritus always resolved. The mean survival time for the patients with cholangiocarcinoma was 12.2 months and 6.33 months for those with gallbladder cancer. Indices of satisfaction (Bismuth's method) were 71% (gallbladder cancer), 93.5% (hilar cholangiocarcinoma), and 92% (metastatic compressions). This new type of surgical endoprosthesis is an alternative in the palliative treatment of neoplastic hilar compression because it is well tolerated, has a low rate of operative mortality or morbidity, and affords an acceptable quality of life for the patients. 
1	Myogenic regulatory protein (MyoD1) expression in childhood solid tumors: diagnostic utility in rhabdomyosarcoma. Transcripts for the muscle regulatory gene MyoD1 are expressed during normal skeletal muscle myogenesis and in rhabdomyosarcomas but not in other tissues or in soft-tissue sarcomas. Here we report the distribution of MyoD1 protein, determined by reactivity with anti-MyoD1 polyclonal sera in normal tissues, rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines, and in a variety of pediatric solid tumors. The distribution of MyoD1 protein was highly restricted in normal tissues and was detected only in fetal skeletal muscle and more faintly in adult skeletal muscle. All six human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines analyzed expressed MyoD1 mRNA transcripts as well as immunoreactive protein. The immunohistochemical expression of MyoD1 protein was then examined in 49 surgical specimens from a variety of pediatric solid tumors. Each of 16 rhabdomyosarcoma specimens was positive for MyoD1, including four that did not express the intermediate filament protein desmin. Two of five specimens originally designated sarcoma type indeterminate (STI) and two of three specimens originally designated extraosseous Ewing's sarcoma (EOE) were positive for MyoD1, suggesting commitment to myogenic differentiation. Three of eight Wilms' tumors, which also expressed desmin and had clearly evident myogenic elements, also were positive for MyoD1. Tumors that failed to express MyoD1 protein included neuroblastoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, non-Hodgkins lymphoma, embryonal sarcoma of the liver, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, malignant rhabdoid tumor, and Ewing's sarcoma of the bone. These results indicate that expression of MyoD1 protein is highly restricted in normal human tissues and that expression of this gene product in malignant tissue may be diagnostic for rhabdomyosarcoma. Furthermore MyoD1 staining may be a valuable adjunct in the classification of pediatric soft-tissue sarcomas. 
3	The Children's Orientation and Amnesia Test: relationship to severity of acute head injury and to recovery of memory. The Children's Orientation and Amnesia Test (COAT) was developed to assess cognition serially during the early stage of recovery from traumatic brain injury in children and adolescents. The norms for the COAT, which is composed of 16 items evaluating general orientation, temporal orientation, and memory, were defined from data obtained from 146 children aged 3 to 15 years. In 37 patients with head injuries, the duration of posttraumatic amnesia, as indicated by the number of days COAT scores were in the impaired range, was significantly related to both verbal and nonverbal memory at the baseline and 6 and 12 months after injury. COAT scores were a better predictor of verbal and nonverbal memory performance than the Glasgow Coma Scale score at 6 and 12 months after the injury. This study shows that the COAT has adequate reliability and validity as a measure of the duration of posttraumatic amnesia in children and adolescents. 
2	Brain and liver dolichol in chronic alcoholism: a necropsy study. Cerebral gray and white matter and liver dolichol levels were measured in postmortem samples from chronic alcoholics and nonalcoholic controls following recent suggestions that dolichol levels may be used as a marker for alcoholism. No significant differences in brain dolichol were found between the control and alcoholic groups. A significant reduction in the liver dolichol was observed in the alcoholic group. This was most marked in those alcoholics with liver disease. 
1	Technetium-99m-HMPAO brain SPECT in medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy: a postoperative evaluation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the predictive value of interictal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using technetium-99m-labeled hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime (HMPAO) for the outcome after temporal lobectomy in patients with complex partial seizures. Out of 40 patients, 21 underwent right-sided and 19 left-sided temporal lobectomy. EEG and CT/MRI were primarily used to select the side of surgery. SPECT results correlated with temporal lobectomy in 68% of the patients. After surgical intervention, memory function was tested for both sides. Following left-sided temporal lobectomy, verbal memory was impaired in 8% of the patients, if SPECT agreed with the side selected for surgery, but in 83%, if it diverged from it. In the present study, there was no relationship between SPECT concordance with the side of temporal lobectomy and outcome as to seizure frequency and non-verbal memory. We conclude that preoperative interictal HMPAO/SPECT can contribute to the prediction of postoperative verbal memory function and that this method should be considered for use prior to temporal lobectomy. 
1	Efficacy of radical neck dissection for the control of cervical metastasis after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Fifty-one patients who had persistent or recurrent neck disease from nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy underwent radical neck dissection. The follow-up period ranged from 0.5 to 9 years (median: 2 years). Multiple cervical lymph node involvement was present in 51% of the patients (26 of 51). Malignant cells were detected in 88% of the resected specimens (45 of 51). The clinical sign of fixation of lymph node is the only factor that affects the successful control of neck disease (p = 0.04). Extracapsular extension of the nodal disease was present, and 35% of the lymph nodes were adherent to surrounding structures at operation (18 of 51). There was one hospital mortality and the overall morbidity was minimal. The actuarial survival at 5 years was 38%, and the probability of control of neck disease was 66%. Radical neck dissection is effective in controlling post-irradiation cervical metastasis from nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
5	Functional heart replacement with the spindle pump: first results. The spindle pump is a nonpulsatile blood pump with a double function, i.e., it works centrifugally and represses simultaneously. The first experiences with this type of pump used as a biventricular assist device in four short-term animal experiments (up to 13 hours) are described. It can be demonstrated that in cases of a normally beating heart, this BVAD decompresses both ventricles by 60-70%, while the aortic pressure is slightly increased; on the other hand, in case of ventricular fibrillation, the BVAD with two spindle pumps maintained the entire circulation, at an arterial pressure between 80 and 90 mmHg with a flow volume between 3.5 and 4 L/min. 
5	Leukocyte larceny: spurious hypoxemia confirmed with pulse oximetry Leukemic patients with extremely high white blood counts may exhibit the phenomenon of leukocyte larceny, in which white blood cells metabolize plasma oxygen in arterial blood gas samples (ABG) producing a spuriously low oxygen tension. We report the case of a leukemic patient with a white blood count in excess of 500,000 in whom multiple ABGs documented hypoxemia out of proportion to his clinical picture. Pulse oximetry was used to confirm higher hemoglobin oxygen saturation to establish the leukocyte larceny. 
1	Clinical management of gastric cancer and concomitant esophagogastric varices. We report the late results of treatment of 13 consecutive patients with gastric cancer and concomitant esophagogastric varices. Of seven good-risk patients classified as Child's class A or B, gastrectomy together with selective shunt operation was performed in two, total gastrectomy with splenectomy in three, and distal partial gastrectomy with paraesophageal devascularization without splenectomy in one. The remaining patient with early gastric cancer underwent distal partial gastrectomy following repeated endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) for treatment of the esophageal varices. Although the majority of patients who underwent surgical repair of varices (i.e., shunt, splenectomy, or devascularization) died, total gastrectomy with splenectomy was the only procedure that led to control of the esophageal varices. Since partial gastrectomy combined with EIS limits the morbidity and mortality of an extensive resection and at the same time controls esophageal variceal bleeding, it is probably the procedure of choice for patients with a carcinoma in the lower two-thirds of the stomach. Concerning non-surgical cases, two patients were effectively treated using laser endoscopy and EIS, without the occurrence of variceal bleeding. The remaining four patients, given chemotherapy or irradiation for treatment of gastric carcinoma, died within 4 months with variceal bleeding or liver failure. For the poor-risk patients with evidence of severe liver dysfunction, laser treatment and EIS would be the treatment of choice. 
3	Serious migraine: a study of some epidemiological aspects. Data are scant concerning some epidemiological aspects of those severe headaches which cause serious personal and economic morbidity. Our purpose was to study the incidence and other epidemiological features of patients suffering from severe migraine exacerbations, in an unselected population. The 64 patients who suffered from severe migraine bouts represented 10.5% of all the new walk-in neurological consultations in the area covered in this study. 70% of these patients were between 10 and 39 years old. Although females clearly predominated in all ages after fifteen, below this age there was a slight male predominance. The calculated incidence of serious migraine exacerbations was 90 per 100,000 people per year, the corrected incidence for females being 143/100,000 and for males 37/100,000. The highest incidence for females was in 15-19 year-olds (377/100,000) and for males in 10-14 year-olds (166/100,000). Our data seem to confirm the periodic nature of this condition since in 80% of patients the migraine bouts (ie: groups of attacks) lasted between two and nine months. Also they support the reported existence of genetic and hormonal factors in the susceptibility to migraine exacerbations. Our results may help in planning the public health aspect of migraine and add some light to the natural history of this common condition. 
2	Geriatric constipation: brief update on a common problem. Constipation occurs frequently in the elderly and is often multifactorial in origin. A search for an underlying cause is necessary, and can often be found by taking an adequate history and performing a thorough physical examination. A minority of patients require further investigation, guided by the clinical setting. Management should be directed at correcting the underlying cause and providing dietary advice and, less commonly, medication to allow restoration of a normal bowel habit. 
4	The effects of etomidate on cerebral metabolism and blood flow in a canine model for hypoperfusion. The effects of etomidate, a nonbarbiturate cerebral metabolic depressant, on cerebral metabolism and blood flow were studied in 29 dogs during cerebral hypoperfusion. Three groups of animals were studied during a 45-minute normotensive and a 30-minute hypotensive period: 10 control animals without etomidate, 11 animals receiving a 0.1-mg/kg etomidate bolus followed by an infusion of 0.05 mg/kg/min etomidate (low-dose group), and eight animals receiving doses of etomidate sufficient to suppress electroencephalographic bursts (high-dose group). The mean arterial pressure fell to similar levels (p less than 0.05) during hypotension in all three groups (40 +/- 5, 38 +/- 3, and 27 +/- 6 mm Hg, respectively). The mean cerebral oxygen extraction fraction rose (p less than 0.05) from 0.23 +/- 0.02 to 0.55 +/- 0.08 in the five control animals tested and from 0.33 +/- 0.02 to 0.53 +/- 0.02 in the seven animals tested in the low-dose group, but did not increase (p greater than 0.05) in the four animals tested in the high-dose group (0.24 +/- 0.03 to 0.23 +/- 0.05). Mean cerebral blood flow levels decreased in all groups during hypotension (p less than 0.05): 42 +/- 3 to 21 +/- 4 ml/100 gm/min (52% +/- 12% decrease) in the five animals tested in the control group, 60 +/- 8 to 24 +/- 6 ml/100 gm/min (56% +/- 13% decrease) in the four animals tested in the low-dose group, and 55 +/- 8 to 22 +/- 3 ml/100 gm/min (60% +/- 4% decrease) in the four animals tested in the high-dose group. In summary, the cerebral oxygen extraction fraction increased in the control animals and low-dose recipients during hypotension, suggesting the presence of threatened cerebral tissue. In contrast, the cerebral oxygen extraction did not change during hypotension when high-dose etomidate was administered. It is concluded that high-dose etomidate may preserve the cerebral metabolic state during hypotension in the present model. 
1	Germ-line transmission of a mutated p53 gene in a cancer-prone family with Li-Fraumeni syndrome Tumour suppressor genes, whose usual function seems to be controlling normal cell proliferation, have been implicated in many inherited and sporadic forms of malignancies Much evidence supports the concept of tumour formation by loss-of-function mutations in suppressor genes, as predicted by the two-hit model of Knudson and DeMars. The suppressor gene, p53, is affected in such a manner by numerous mutations, which occur in a variety of human tumours. These mutations usually represent the loss of one allele and the substitution of a single base in the other. We have now analysed the p53 gene in a family affected by Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant syndrome characterized by the occurrence of diverse mesenchymal and epithelial neoplasms at multiple sites. In some instances the neoplasms seem to be related to exposure to carcinogens, including ionizing radiation. The Li-Fraumeni family that we studied had noncancerous skin fibroblasts (NSF) with an unusual radiation-resistant phenotype. DNA derived from the NSF cells of four family members, spanning two generations, had the same point mutation in codon 245 (GGC----GAC) of the p53 gene. This mutation leads to substitution of aspartic acid for glycine in one of the regions identified as a frequent target of point mutations in p53. The NSF cell lines with the mutation also retained the normal p53 allele. This inherited p53 mutation may predispose the members of this family to increased susceptibility to cancer. 
2	Duodenal ulcer hemorrhage with and without dyspepsia. To clarify the clinical significance of dyspepsia in patients with bleeding duodenal ulcer, we studied 298 patients prospectively. Ages of patients ranged from 16 to 81 yr (mean 45.9). There were 244 (82%) dyspeptic and 54 (18%) nondyspeptic patients. In the dyspeptic group, significantly more patients were taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In the nondyspeptic group, there was a higher percentage of patients with duodenal bulb deformity (p less than 0.005), which deformity was related to previous peptic ulcer disease. The age, sex, past history of dyspepsia or bleeding, consumption of alcohol and cigarettes, and the hospital course of the two groups of patients did not differ significantly. Our results show that the clinical course of duodenal ulcer hemorrhage is not significantly different in patients with or without dyspepsia, and indicate that bleeding and dyspepsia probably are two independent presentations in the natural course of the disease. The significance of the correlation between dyspepsia and duodenal bulb deformity is discussed. 
3	Validation of a surveillance case definition of carpal tunnel syndrome The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has proposed a surveillance case definition for work-related carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). The case definition requires the presence of median nerve symptoms; one or more occupational risk factors; and objective evidence of CTS including one of three physical examination findings or nerve conduction tests diagnostic of CTS. We evaluated the performance of the NIOSH case definition, restricting our analysis to cases in which physical examination findings served as the objective criterion. Nerve conduction studies were used as the gold standard. Seventy-eight workers were studied; 38 percent had CTS. The NIOSH case definition had sensitivity of 0.67 (95% CI = 0.57, 0.77), specificity of 0.58 (95% CI = 0.47, 0.69), and positive and negative predictive values of 0.50 (95% CI = 0.39, 0.61) and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.64, 0.84), respectively. Overall 38 percent of subjects were classified incorrectly. In a sample with a prevalence of 15 percent, as might be encountered in high risk workplaces, the positive predictive value would be 0.22. In conclusion, when physical examination findings serve as the objective criterion the performance of the case definition is modest reflecting the limited diagnostic value of its component tests and indicating that effective screening for CTS awaits improved diagnostic techniques. 
3	Evaluating oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization with mixed venous oxygen saturation monitoring: a case study approach. Three cases studies are presented to demonstrate clinical application of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) monitoring in critical care nursing practice. Examples of critically ill patients are used to demonstrate how SvO2 monitoring can be used in clinical practice to reflect an imbalance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. In the first case, the patient had a problem with oxygen delivery. Continuous SvO2 data aided nurses in guiding, adjusting, and assessing therapy. The second case demonstrates how SvO2 monitoring can provide an early sign of a life-threatening complication. The final case is one in which the patient had a problem with oxygen utilization. In all the cases, continuous SvO2 data provided important information about the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization. 
5	Ulcerative lesions and herpes simplex virus type 2 in a patient with Evan's syndrome. We have described a case of herpes genitalis in a patient with Evans's syndrome who had violaceous macules leading to deep ulcerations. This case serves as a reminder that HSV infection may be atypical and have an unusual course in immunocompromised patients. With the availability of specific therapy for this infection, it is important to consider HSV in the differential diagnosis of all ulcerative skin lesions. 
1	A comparison of Ho's, International Union Against Cancer, and American Joint Committee stage classifications for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Five hundred sixty-four nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC), mostly of undifferentiated histologic type, were studied for survival, distant metastasis, and local recurrence. All had computerized tomography of the nasopharynx and skull base (CT-NP) and fiberoptic nasopharyngoscopy for evaluation of the primary tumor. Regional disease was assessed by palpation. A computer data base was formed on presentation, containing all information required for staging according to Ho's, the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), and the American Joint Committee (AJC) classifications. The three were compared for their efficacy in predicting prognosis. Ho's classification was superior to the other two because its overall stages differed from one another more significantly in the actuarial survival (ASR), disease-free survival (DFS), and freedom from distant metastasis (FDM) rates, and its N staging was more accurate in predicting FDM. Stages T1 and T2 of UICC/AJC were similar in the freedom from local recurrence rate (FLR) and should be grouped together, equivalent to Ho's T1. A more even patients number distribution among the stages also favored the use of Ho's classification. 
2	Reduction in hepatic venous pressure gradient as a consequence of volume contraction due to chronic administration of spironolactone in patients with cirrhosis and no ascites. The effect of plasma volume contraction induced by a 4-wk administration of spironolactone or furosemide on the hepatic venous pressure gradient was evaluated in consecutively allocated patients with cirrhosis and no ascites. In the spironolactone group (n = 15), the hepatic venous pressure gradient decreased significantly (p less than 0.005), by 21.8%, with a significant contraction of circulating plasma volume (p less than 0.01). Although there were no statistically significant correlations between the change in hepatic venous pressure gradient and changes in circulating plasma volume or in simultaneously determined systemic hemodynamics, a significant negative correlation (r = -0.74, p less than 0.01, n = 12) between the hepatic venous pressure gradient change and the post-treatment plasma aldosterone levels was found. However, in the furosemide group (n = 10), the hepatic venous pressure gradient and circulating plasma volume did not significantly decrease. Our data demonstrated a significant reduction in the hepatic venous pressure gradient on a chronic administration of spironolactone, which may have been due to volume contractions in patients with cirrhosis and no ascites. 
1	Generation of "soft x-rays" by using the free electron laser as a proposed means of diagnosing and treating breast cancer. The diagnosis and treatment of breast lesions may be markedly enhanced by the use of a unique new source of near-monochromatic x-rays. Concentric beams of near-monochromatic x-ray photons may be generated by collision of the free electron laser (FEL) electron beam with the optical beam in an interaction zone that delivers the x-rays to a shirtsleeve environment. The absence of Compton scatter and the photoelectric interaction within tissues improves conspicuity of lesions by two to six times. Increased attenuation of x-rays in malignant vs. normal tissues makes tumors more obvious. K-edge subtraction allows chemical analysis of tumors in vivo--all at radiation doses that are one-tenth to one-fiftieth that delivered by the lowest-dose mammographic x-ray technique available. This allows for an increased sensitivity and specificity and permits prediction of histology, negating necessity for biopsies. Selective bond-breaking at depth in tissues as well as x-ray-activated photodynamic therapy are also being explored. 
2	Acute axonal polyneuropathy associated with anti-GM1 antibodies following Campylobacter enteritis. We report 2 patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) following Campylobacter jejuni enteritis. Electrophysiologic studies indicated that the predominant process was axonal degeneration of motor nerves, and clinical recovery was poor. Serum testing by thin-layer chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay revealed that the sera from both patients contained high titers of IgG antibody against GM1 ganglioside. These cases may represent a subgroup of GBS as acute axonal polyneuropathy following C jejuni enteritis associated with anti-GM1 antibodies. 
5	Hemodynamic effects of partial correction of chronic anemia by recombinant human erythropoietin in patients on dialysis. Eighteen patients on chronic hemodialysis with renal anemia were treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO). Hemodynamic parameters in the resting state were determined before and after successful treatment. Posttreatment cardiac index was decreased (3.3 v 2.8 L/min/m2), whereas diastolic blood pressure (72 v 79 mm Hg) and calculated peripheral resistance (2,230 v 2,860 dyne.cm.s-5) were increased significantly when compared with the pretreatment period. We conclude from our study that the increase of blood pressure as seen in patients on dialysis, who are effectively treated with r-HuEPO, is due to an increase in peripheral resistance. This increase overrules the decrease of cardiac index and might well be a result of peripheral vasoconstriction due to improved oxygen availability. 
1	Primary malignant peritoneal mesothelioma. A report of seven cases and a review of the literature. Mesothelioma of the peritoneum is a rare malignant neoplasm easily mistaken by both surgeon and pathologist for one of the more common neoplasms of the abdomen. Review of our records from metropolitan-area hospitals for the past 15 years identified seven patients with primary peritoneal mesotheliomas. Their diagnosis, management, and survival is analyzed. We report a case of an extended survivor (7 years) and one of a long-term survivor (15 years), as well as what we believe to be the only case in the literature presenting with a coexistent malignant neoplasm. Prevention of this commonly fatal neoplasm is linked to avoiding occupational exposure to asbestos; long-term survival for a few patients may be achieved with correct identification of the neoplasm and aggressive management. This report includes a review of the literature. 
5	Urothelial hyperplasia and neoplasia. III. Detection of nitrosamine production with different bacterial genera in chronic urinary tract infections of rats. Various agents have been implicated in inducing urothelial cancer. Although drugs, occupational and environmental carcinogens are more widely accepted as playing a major role as urothelial carcinogens, several investigations suggest that bacteria may play a role. The mechanism of how bacteria may interact with the host to augment the development of urothelial carcinoma is not well understood. Clinically, investigators have linked the development of infection, urinary stones and indwelling catheters with urothelial cancer. Other investigators have suggested that the mechanism may be related to the production of carcinogenic compounds (nitrosamines) which can be detected during urinary tract infection. In our laboratory, we showed that rats with chronic urinary tract infections produced increasing urinary levels of N,N dimethylnitrosamine over a 24 week period and that the production correlated with hyperplasia and early neoplasia of the bladder epithelium. Three bacterial genera were used and two of these (Escherichia coli and a protein sp.) showed production of increasing levels of urinary nitrosamine and correlated with infection. The purpose of this current study is to determine if other bacterial genera and strains can also produce similar increasing nitrosamine levels in the rat model of chronic urinary tract infection and thus provide evidence that a number of bacterial genera and strains can produce nitrosamines in vivo. Also, the histology of the chronically infected bladder was examined for hyperplasia and neoplasia. 
5	Immunotherapy in acute arsenic poisoning. We investigated the use of immunotherapy on the treatment of sodium arsenite toxicity. Female balb/c mice injected with arsanilic acid conjugated to a carrier protein (ovalbumin) were shown to produce antibodies (arsenic reactive serum, ARS) reactive with arsanilic acid and sodium arsenite. Serum was tested for anti-ARS antibodies using a solid phase radioimmunoassay. The antisera bound to ARS conjugated to the synthetic copolymer glutamic acid60 tyrosine30 when diluted as high as 1:4096. Following multiple injections of 100 micrograms of arsanilic acid--ovalbumin compound, mortality on injection with sodium arsenite 0.87 mg/kg i.p. one week later decreased to 0 deaths in 22 pretreated mice vs 9 deaths in 29 untreated mice (31% mortality; p less than .005). No decrease in mortality was noted at higher challenges (1.15 mg/kg) of sodium arsenite. Antisera from pretreated mice was injected 0.1 cc i.p. into 12 week old female balb/c mice followed by an injection of sodium arsenite 0.87 mg/kg i.p. at 10 minutes. Again a protective effect was observed with 0 deaths in 18 mice vs eight deaths in 21 mice (38%; p less than .005). Seventeen additional mice were given an injection of 0.87 mg/kg i.p. of sodium arsenite. After 30 minutes, all mice became symptomatic whereupon antisera 0.1 cc i.p. was given. The one day mortality (2/17, 12%) was possibly lower than the combined control mortality (17/50, 34%; p less than 0.07). There was no change in mortality noted when antisera was administered to mice acutely exposed to 5 mg/kg HgCl2. 
2	Furosemide absorption in patients with cirrhosis. Twelve patients with cirrhosis (seven mild and five severe) were administered intravenous and oral furosemide in random order to assess its absorption and disposition. Total serum clearance (113 +/- 49 ml/min), volume of distribution (11.9 +/- 4.5 L), and elimination half-life (166 +/- 149 minutes) were similar to those reported previously in both healthy control subjects and patients with cirrhosis. Bioavailability of 58% +/- 17% (range, 37% to 82%) was comparable to that of previous studies, and there was no difference between patients with mild and those with severe cirrhosis. In 9 of 12 patients the mean absorption time was longer than the mean residence time determined after intravenous administration (mean for all patients, 203 +/- 86 versus 134 +/- 101 minutes; p less than 0.05), indicating that furosemide followed a "flip-flop" model in these patients. In all patients the mean absorption time was prolonged relative to normal subjects irrespective of the presence of edema. As such, the slower absorption of furosemide in edematous states, such as congestive heart failure and cirrhosis, does not appear to be a consequence of edema per se. Moreover, because similar changes occur in patients with congestive heart failure, it seems that diseases with diverse pathophysiology can slow furosemide absorption. 
1	Clinical review 16: Parathyroid hormone-related proteins: coming of age in the 1990s. The last 3 yr have yielded a fertile harvest of new information on the HHM clinical syndrome and on the novel peptide hormone family responsible for the syndrome. Whereas the clinical riddle enshrouding the HHM syndrome first posed in the early 1940s appears to have been largely solved, a whole new field, concerning the physiological role(s) of PTHRP has opened. The field has evolved rapidly and provides an example of fruitful clinical investigation: the original problem was a clinical one (the HHM syndrome); understanding the clinical disorder led to pursuit of the problem in the laboratory (adenylate cyclase assays, protein purification, molecular cloning, PTHRP synthesis); and observations made in the laboratory have rapidly yielded clinical fruits (PTHRP immunoassays) and opened a new window on normal physiology. 
3	Improving outcomes of analgesic treatment: is education enough? Frequent undertreatment of analgesic-responsive acute pain and chronic cancer pain persists, despite intensive efforts to provide clinicians with information about analgesics. A set of background factors must be addressed in interventions to improve pain treatment: Traditional patterns of clinician and patient interaction on the ward, quality assurance, and drug regulatory practices do not support prompt recognition and treatment of pain. Possible interventions to modify these patterns of daily practice include monitoring and displaying patient pain ratings routinely, making available educational tools to assist optimal drug ordering, encouraging patients to communicate about unrelieved pain, reviewing quality assurance of pain treatment regimens, increasing behavioral research into analgesic prescribing, and selectively modifying narcotics regulatory practices. 
1	Immunophenotypic characteristics of cerebrospinal fluid cells in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at diagnosis. The presence of meningeal involvement in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may have important prognostic and therapeutic implications. Conventional methods of diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) leukemia rely on the interpretation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell morphology, which may produce ambiguous results in the presence of minimal leukemic involvement. A methodology has been developed for immunophenotyping small numbers of CSF cells while preserving cell morphology. CSF samples from 33 children with CD10 (common ALL antigen [CALLA]) positive ALL were examined at initial presentation using both conventional morphology and this combined immunohistopathologic technique. Six (18%) of the samples contained lymphoblasts or cells considered morphologically suspicious for leukemic involvement. Nine additional samples (27% of the total) had normal CSF morphology, but contained increased numbers of CALLA positive cells. Twelve of the 33 samples were also examined for the simultaneous presence of nuclear terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and demonstrated increased numbers of cells positive for both TdT and CD10. These data suggest that a large proportion of children with ALL may have abnormalities of CSF cells at initial diagnosis consistent with the presence of occult leukemic involvement. 
5	Prolonged paralysis following suxamethonium and the use of neostigmine. A case of prolonged neuromuscular block following the administration of suxamethonium is reported. Three hours after administration of suxamethonium, a well defined, recovering phase II block was demonstrated with a T4:T1 ratio of 0.25, and neostigmine was administered. Although the T4:T1 ratio was improved to 0.9, T1 remained at 25% of control, and significant paralysis persisted which responded to administration of cholinesterase. It is concluded that neuromuscular monitoring cannot reliably predict reversibility in such cases and that, even after 3 h, antagonism of prolonged suxamethonium block should commence with cholinesterase, followed by neostigmine if necessary. 
1	Synthetic analogues of fumagillin that inhibit angiogenesis and suppress tumour growth. Neovascularization is critical for the growth of tumours and is a dominant feature in a variety of angiogenic diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, haemangiomas, arthritis and psoriasis. Recognition of the potential therapeutic benefit of controlling unabated capillary growth has led to a search for safe and effective angiogenesis inhibitors. We report here the synthesis of a family of novel inhibitors that are analogues of fumagillin, a naturally secreted antibiotic of Aspergillus fumigatus fresenius. We first isolated this fungus from a contaminated culture of capillary endothelial cells. Purified fumagillin inhibited endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and tumour-induced angiogenesis in vivo; it also inhibited tumour growth in mice, but prolonged administration was limited because it caused severe weight loss. Synthesis of fumagillin analogues yielded potent angiogenesis inhibitors ('angioinhibins') which suppress the growth of a wide variety of tumours with relatively few side-effects. 
4	Peripheral alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in three models of hypertension in rats: an in vitro autoradiography study. In vitro autoradiography was used to compare peripheral alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic receptor binding in various tissues using [3H]prazosin and [3H]rauwolscine, respectively, in three models of experimental hypertension in rats. Models studied included two-kidney, one-clip hypertension, one-kidney, one-clip hypertension, desoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension, and three normotensive control groups: two-kidney control, one-kidney control and salt-loaded control. Blood pressures at death were significantly higher in all three hypertensive groups compared with normotensive controls, but there were no significant differences among the hypertensive or normotensive groups. Plasma norepinephrine levels were significantly elevated in all three hypertensive groups compared with respective controls, with no significant differences among hypertensive or control groups. In all three hypertensive groups, there were significant reductions in binding of aortic and mesenteric vascular alpha-1 receptors, renal tubular alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors, and adrenal cortical alpha-2 receptors when compared with respective control groups. Reduced binding of cardiac ventricular alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors was also found in all hypertensive groups, but not to statistically significant levels. No significant differences in intestinal alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptor binding were detected in either hypertensive or normotensive groups. The results suggest increased peripheral sympathetic activity in all three models of experimental hypertension, which is associated with down-regulation of alpha-1 and alpha-2 receptors in a number of peripheral tissues, especially those that control cardiovascular hemodynamics and fluid and salt balance. There is no evidence of an increase in peripheral alpha receptor binding as has often been found in some models of genetic or spontaneous hypertension. 
3	Mutation of the prion protein in Libyan Jews with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. BACKGROUND. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a transmissible neurodegenerative disorder that occurs more than 100 times more frequently among Libyan Jews than in the worldwide population. We examined 11 patients with the disease--10 Libyan Jews from Israel and 1 Libyan Jew from Italy--to determine whether abnormalities of the prion protein could be detected in them. Abnormal forms of this host-encoded protein are the predominant if not sole components of the transmissible agent that causes the disease. METHODS. The prion-protein open-reading frame in peripheral-leukocyte DNA from the Italian patient was amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization was used to assess a prion-protein codon 200 lysine mutation in the 10 Israeli patients and 37 control subjects. RESULTS. The prion-protein sequence in DNA from the Italian patient revealed a single nucleotide change (G----A) at the first position of codon 200 that resulted in a substitution of lysine for glutamate. This substitution was detected in all 10 Israeli patients, 8 of whom had a positive family history of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. One patient was homozygous for the lysine mutation, and her clinical course did not differ from that of the patients heterozygous for the mutation. The lysine mutation was not found in one Moroccan Jew from Israel with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. CONCLUSIONS. The codon 200 lysine mutation of the prion-protein gene is consistently present among Libyan Jews with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, strongly supporting a genetic pathogenesis of their illness. The similarity of the clinical courses of the patient homozygous for this mutation and the patients heterozygous for it argues that familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a true dominant disorder. 
4	Transient left ventricular cavitary dilation during dipyridamole-thallium imaging as an indicator of severe coronary artery disease. Transient left ventricular (LV) cavitary dilation during dipyridamole-thallium imaging was reported in 45 of 510 (9%) consecutive patients referred for dipyridamole-thallium imaging. Clinical and hemodynamic effects observed during dipyridamole infusion were not predictive of transient cavitary dilation on the thallium images. Coronary angiography was performed in 32 of the 45 patients: 75% had either left main, 3-vessel or "high-risk" 2-vessel coronary artery disease. Although 25 of 45 patients (56%) with transient cavitary dilation were either asymptomatic or had only grade 1/4 effort angina, 16 of 25 patients (64%) not referred for coronary revascularization sustained a cardiac event during a mean follow-up of 12 months. Most events were cardiac deaths (75%) and 87% of events occurred within 4 months of the test. Noncardiac surgery was performed in 187 of the 510 patients. The postoperative cardiac event rate was 2% in the 101 patients with normal scans or fixed defects, 19% in 75 patients with reversible perfusion defects and 58% in 12 patients with reversible cavitary dilation (p less than 0.0001). Thus, transient LV dilation during dipyridamole-thallium imaging is a marker of severe underlying coronary artery disease, denotes a poor prognosis and predicts a high risk of postoperative cardiac complications in patients who undergo noncardiac surgery. 
1	Distribution and specific identification of papillomavirus major capsid protein epitopes by immunocytochemistry and epitope scanning of synthetic peptides. Monoclonal (MAbs) and polyclonal antibodies were produced against the major capsid protein of detergent-disrupted, purified bovine papillomavirus type 1 (BPV-1). The precise locations of the corresponding epitopes were identified by the reactivity of MAbs and selected polyclonal antibodies with synthetic, overlapping, hexameric peptides corresponding with 95% of the BPV-1 major capsid protein. The topography of these epitopes was determined by reactivity of antibodies with intact (conformational and nonconformational surface epitopes) and disrupted (external or internal nonconformational epitopes) BPV-1 virions. The distribution of epitopes in various papillomaviruses of 13 different species was determined by reactivity of the MAbs and polyclonal sera with productively infected, formalin-fixed papillomas, fibropapillomas, and fibromas. Epitope scanning, using MAbs and polyclonal antisera, resulted in the precise location of BPV-1 hexameric epitopes that could be correlated with their topography on the capsid and distribution in papillomatous lesions of various species. 
3	Familial paroxysmal kinesigenic ataxia and continuous myokymia. A large family with paroxysmal ataxia and continuous myokymic discharges is described. The disorder is of autosomal dominant inheritance. During attacks coordination of movements and balance are disturbed; often a postural tremor of the head and the hands and fine twitching in some of the facial and hand muscles are present. The attacks usually last a few minutes and may occur several times per day. They first appear in childhood and tend to abate after early adulthood. The attacks are frequently precipitated by kinesigenic stimuli similar to those in paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis. Their occurrence can be reduced or prevented by carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. Between attacks a slight postural tremor and ataxia was found in a few of the elderly affected members. Fine rippling myokymia was obvious in a few and could be detected on close inspection in about half of the adults. Electromyography (EMG) showed myokymic discharges in all affected members. The characteristics and reactivity of this myokymic activity suggest multiple impulse generation in the peripheral nerves. 
2	Tongue atrophy in mixed connective tissue disease. A case is reported of tongue atrophy in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) and major myositic involvement. The case highlights oropharyngeal aspects of MCTD, including inability to wear dentures, dysarthria, and dysphagia. To our knowledge this is the first report of major tongue involvement in myositis as part of MCTD. 
5	A pilot study of intermediate-dose methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside, "spread-out" or "up-front," in continuation therapy for childhood non-T, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A Pediatric Oncology Group study. One hundred six children with newly diagnosed non-T-, non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated in a Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) pilot study in which six courses of intermediate-dose methotrexate (MTX) and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) (1 g/m2 each) were added to a "backbone" of standard continuation therapy. The dose and sequence of MTX/Ara-C administration were based on a preclinical model that demonstrated synergism between MTX and Ara-C. Poor-risk patients (n = 49) were assigned to "up-front" therapy, in which the MTX/Ara-C courses were administered during the initial 15 weeks of remission. Standard-risk patients (n = 57) were assigned to "spread-out" therapy, in which the MTX/Ara-C courses were interspersed at 12-week intervals within continuation treatment. Toxicity after intermediate-dose MTX/Ara-C, principally neutropenia and fever, was judged significant but manageable. Unexpectedly, the incidence of fever and neutropenia less than 500/mm3 was greater after "spread-out" therapy (38%) than after "up-front" therapy (6%). At 4 years, the Kaplan-Meier estimate of event-free survival (EFS) is 71% (+/- 7%) for standard-risk patients and 53% (+/- 8%) for poor-risk patients. The results of this pilot study support the use of intermediate-dose MTX/Ara-C in additional studies. 
3	Differential memory and executive functions in demented patients with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Selected aspects of verbal memory and executive function were compared in 11 demented Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and 11 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with equally severe dementia, with 11 healthy controls matched for age and education. Semantic and episodic memory were impared in all patients compared with controls, but to a relatively greater degree in AD patients than in those with PD. In contrast, demented PD patients were relatively more compromised on executive tasks. These findings, taken in the context of the neuropathological and neurochemical overlap between demented PD and AD patients, suggest that differences in neurobehavioural patterns in patients with these diseases are relative, rather than absolute. 
1	Autologous bone marrow transplantation for high-grade lymphoid malignancy using melphalan/irradiation conditioning without marrow purging or cryopreservation. The Northern Regional Bone Marrow Transplant Group. We report the safety and efficacy of 34 consecutive autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) procedures performed in adult patients with high-grade lymphoid malignancy after remission induction therapy. Fifteen patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and six with high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) received pretransplant conditioning with intravenous (IV) melphalan and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI). Thirteen other patients with NHL were conditioned with melphalan alone, having previously received local involved field radiotherapy. Unmanipulated noncryopreserved autologous marrow was reinfused within 48 hours of harvesting. Engraftment occurred in all patients with medians of 10 days of neutropenia (neutrophils less than 0.5 x 10(9)/L), 4-day platelet transfusion requirement, 3 U packed RBC transfusion, and 18 days in hospital posttransplant. There were no procedure-related deaths. Actuarial disease-free survival in the 13 patients with ALL receiving autotransplant early in first remission is 48% with a median follow-up of 3 years. Two other ALL patients who had autotransplants after a period of maintenance therapy also remain in complete remission (CR). These results compare favorably with our 34% disease-free survival (DFS) in 15 allogeneic ALL transplant patients and 21% DFS in 19 patients on standard maintenance after a common induction schedule. No relapses have occurred in the 17 NHL patients transplanted in remission (median follow-up 2 years), but the two NHL patients who developed recurrent disease before ABMT died of progressive disease after temporary responses. We conclude that this method of ABMT results in rapid reengraftment with lack of toxicity and that the conditioning treatment used shows good efficacy against disease. It is applicable in high-grade lymphoid malignancy in first remission, and our results call into question the need for marrow purging in ALL and NHL patients transplanted in first remission. 
1	The use of ketoconazole in ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone syndrome. The authors report a patient with ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) syndrome (EAS) resulting from small cell lung cancer. Treatment with ketoconazole (KCZ) resulted in significant suppression of serum cortisol levels. The authors confirmed KCZ to be a useful adjunct in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. 
4	Effect of increased left atrial pressure on breathing frequency in anesthetized dog. Distension or loading of the isolated canine left heart caused reflex tachypnea in prior studies. The object of the present effort was to explore the possibility that this depended primarily on atrial distension. Cardiopulmonary bypass perfusion and ligation of pulmonary veins were used to isolate the left-heart chambers of anesthetized dogs. Simultaneous distension of the beating left atrium and fibrillating ventricle stimulated breathing frequency (f), whereas isolated ventricular distension did not. At other times, intervals of atrial fibrillation were imposed under two different conditions: 1) while the right heart and lungs were bypassed and systemic perfusion was provided by the left ventricle using blood returned to the left atrium by pump and 2) while the ventricles fibrillated and systemic perfusion was supplied directly by the pump. Atrial fibrillation increased left atrial pressure and stimulated f in condition 1. In condition 2, f increased only if fibrillation was associated with a rise in left atrial pressure. Vagal cooling blocked the effect of fibrillation. I conclude that left atrial distension may initiate reflex tachypnea. 
1	Intraoperative radiation of canine carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve. Therapeutic applications in the management of advanced head and neck cancers. As a step in the application of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) for treating advanced head and neck cancers, preliminary information was obtained on the radiation tolerance of the canine common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve to a single, high-dose electron beam. Both sides of the neck of eight mongrel dogs were operated on to expose an 8-cm segment of common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve. One side of the neck was irradiated, using escalating doses of 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 cGy. The contralateral side of the neck served as the unirradiated control. At 3 and 6 months after IORT, one dog at each dose level was killed. None of the dogs developed carotid bleeding at any time after IORT. Light microscopic investigations using hematoxylin-eosin staining on the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein showed no consistent changes that suggested radiation damage; however, the Masson trichrome stain and hydroxyproline concentration of irradiated common carotid artery indicated an increase in the collagen content of the tunica media. Marked changes in the irradiated vagus nerve were seen, indicating severe demyelination and loss of nerve fibers, which appeared to be radiation-dose dependent. Four patients with advanced recurrent head and neck cancer were treated with surgical resection and IORT without any acute or subacute complications. The role of IORT as a supplement to surgery, external beam irradiation, and chemotherapy in selected patients with advanced head and neck cancer needs further exploration. 
1	Suppression of serum insulin level by diazoxide does not alter serum testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin levels in healthy, nonobese women. Suppression of serum insulin levels with diazoxide is associated with a decrease in serum testosterone and an increase in serum sex hormone-binding globulin in obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. To determine whether physiologic insulin levels play a regulatory role in the androgen status of nonobese women with normal menses, the androgen status of five nonobese normal women was assessed on two occasions: during a control study and after 10 days of oral diazoxide (100 mg, three times daily) administration. Insulin release in response to 100 gm oral glucose administration decreased from 108.0 +/- 28.2 to 49.3 +/- 5.2 nmol.min/L (p = 0.05) after diazoxide administration. However, despite suppression of insulin release, diazoxide administration did not affect serum total testosterone (diazoxide, 0.73 +/- 0.10; control, 0.69 +/- 0.11 nmol/L; p = NS) or sex hormone-binding globulin (diazoxide, 79.7 +/- 16.6; control, 70.2 +/- 12.6 nmol/L; p = NS) concentrations. These observations suggest that physiologic insulin levels in nonobese healthy women do not regulate testosterone metabolism and that diazoxide does not exert a direct or independent effect on serum testosterone or sex hormone-binding globulin levels. 
5	Isolated trigeminal sensory loss secondary to a distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm: case report. A previously healthy 25-year-old woman suddenly developed right-sided facial numbness and a headache. The neurological examination was within normal limits with the exception of meningismus and right-sided facial sensory loss. A computed tomographic scan and a magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated an acute hematoma in the right cerebellopontine angle. A 4-vessel cerebral angiogram revealed no abnormalities. Posterior fossa exploration disclosed a large, partially thrombosed, fusiform anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm, which indented the pons at the trigeminal root entry zone. The aneurysm was excised, and the patient made an excellent recovery. She was left with a persistent trigeminal sensory deficit. Anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms are rare lesions that generally present with a cerebellopontine angle syndrome; occasionally, facial sensory loss is also a feature. Isolated trigeminal sensory findings, as illustrated in this case, are extremely unusual in posterior fossa vascular lesions. 
5	Nondiagnosed left main ostial stenosis partly due to the use of 5 French coronary angiographic catheters. Two cases have been reported in which the use of 5 F angiographic catheters is associated with a failure to diagnose an ostial stenosis of the left main coronary artery (LMCA). In both cases, the erroneous diagnosis led to an inappropriate indication for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on other stenosed vessels, and the ostial left main lesion was unexpectedly discovered when using 8F guiding catheters. It is supposed that the ability of performed 5F catheters to pass easily through an ostial lesion makes detection of such proximal stenosis much more difficult. We suggest that the choice of 5F catheters must be approached with caution when left main disease is potentially expected from the clinical features. 
3	Intraoperative assessment of cerebral ischemia during carotid surgery. One of the problems in carotid surgery is the intraoperative detection of brain ischemia. None of the methods (EEG; stump pressure) applied so far have been successful. Branston et al. (1974) found a threshold relationship between cortical cerebral blood flow and cortical somatosensory evoked potential (SEP). As the local blood flow fell below about 16 ml/100 g/min a progressive reduction occurred in the amplitude of the cortical evoked potential (N20/P25), implying a fundamental failure of neuronal function in the somatosensory cortex. We have monitored cortical SEP (somatosensory evoked potential) during 734 CEA's (carotid endarterectomies) in order to find an index of risk of incipient cerebral ischemia during carotid cross-clamping, to determine the need for shunting and the causes of early irreversible neurologic deficits. In 59 cases evaluation of SEP was not possible because of technical difficulties. During 586 CEA's no alteration of SEP occurred. However, 4 patients had an immediate postoperative neurologic deficit, while the SEP remained normal. Abnormal SEP occurred in 89 cases and in 6 of these an irreversible loss of SEP was seen. These patients awoke with a new neurologic deficit. We found a reversible abnormal SEP in 83 cases. Reversible changes of SEP occurred mainly during carotid clamping. The diagnostic sensitivity of intraoperative SEP monitoring in predicting neurologic outcome was 60% with a specificity of 100%. 
5	Sinus node-atrioventricular node isolation: long-term results with the "corridor" operation for atrial fibrillation The "corridor" operation is designed to restore sinus rhythm to patients with atrial fibrillation by electrically isolating the sinus node, a band of atrial tissue and the atrioventricular (AV) node from the remaining atrial tissue. Nine patients with drug-refractory atrial fibrillation underwent this operation; four patients had chronic atrial fibrillation and five had paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; the mean duration of symptoms was 12 +/- 8 years. Patient ages ranged from 25 to 68 years (mean 48 +/- 12). At preoperative electrophysiologic study, no patient had evidence of an accessory AV pathway or AV node reentry. Sinus node recovery time could not be determined in five patients because of recurrent atrial fibrillation during or before programmed stimulation. At operation the corridor of atrial tissue connecting the sinus and AV nodes was successfully isolated from the remaining left and right atrial tissue in all patients. One patient required early reoperation for recurrent atrial fibrillation before hospital discharge. At the predischarge electrophysiologic study, the corridor remained isolated in all patients except for one patient who had intermittent conduction between the corridor and excluded right atrium. One patient had nonsustained atrial fibrillation and one had atrial tachycardia evident in the corridor. Atypical AV node reentry of uncertain significance was induced in one other patient. Over a total follow-up of 191 patient months (mean 21 +/- 20), seven patients remained free of atrial fibrillation. Two patients had recurrent atrial fibrillation, which in one patient was effectively controlled by a single antiarrhythmic agent. A permanent pacemaker was implanted in four patients for sinus node dysfunction. 
2	Surgical management of nonparasitic cystic liver disease. We report clinical features, surgical management, recurrences, and follow-up study of 12 patients with simple hepatic cyst, 11 patients with polycystic liver disease, and 19 patients with cystadenoma who were surgically treated over a 25-year period. The median age of patients was 48 years, and 37 women and 5 men were in the series. The most common presenting symptom and physical finding were chronic abdominal pain and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. The most commonly associated disease was polycystic kidney disease, which was an associated finding in 5 of the 11 patients with polycystic liver disease (45%). The most valuable diagnostic studies in all groups were computed tomography and ultrasonography. The location of the disease was bilobar in patients with polycystic liver disease, with a right lobe predominance in 18% of patients. The right lobe was also predominant in 83% of patients with simple hepatic cyst and 58% of patients with cystadenoma. Of all solitary cystic lesions in the left lobe, 75% of them were cystadenomas. Of the 66 surgical procedures performed, aspiration was associated with a failure rate of 100%; partial excision, a failure rate of 61%; and total excision and liver resection, a failure rate of 0%. Orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in three patients and was associated with two early deaths. Partial excision relieved symptoms in three patients (43%) with polycystic liver disease. Total excision, enucleation, or liver resection with cyst(s) is the treatment of choice for non-parasitic cystic lesions of the liver. 
4	Blood-pool radionuclide angiography in patients with a Novacor left ventricular assist device. Blood-pool radionuclide angiography was used to investigate the left ventricular function in eight patients who received a Novacor assist device as a bridge-to-cardiac transplantation. Studies were performed during maximal and minimal tolerated assist device flows. The left ventricular ejection fraction, volumes, cardiac output, and the pump ejection fraction were computer-assessed. All patients had severe left ventricular dilation and hypokinesis before insertion of the assist device, with a mean ejection fraction of 18% +/- 4% which improved to 44% +/- 18% (p less than 0.01) during maximal assist device flows, but fell to 25% +/- 15% (p less than 0.01) during minimal flows. The ventricular volumes became normal at maximal assist device flow but increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during minimal flow. The pump was well visualized and had an ejection fraction of 82% +/- 7%. These data indicate that this assist device effectively unloads the left ventricle. The deterioration in ejection fraction following decrease in assist device flow is in keeping with the dependency of these patients on the device to sustain adequate hemodynamics. 
1	The central (intraosseous) calcifying odontogenic cyst: an analysis of 215 cases. This study reviews and analyzes the clinical, radiographic, and histomorphologic features of the 215 cases of central calcifying odontogenic cyst (CCOC) reported in the literature. Based on the present information, a clinicopathologic classification of calcifying odontogenic cyst is proposed. The CCOC is also compared with its peripheral counterpart and the differences discussed. 
4	Doxazosin for the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure: results of a randomized double-blind and placebo-controlled study. In this study we evaluated the effects of once-daily administration of oral doxazosin in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHF). After a stabilization period of at least 2 weeks with digitalis and diuretics, 73 patients with chronic CHF were randomized to receive additionally either doxazosin or placebo in double-blind fashion. Patients underwent weekly dose adjustments with increasing doses of doxazosin (1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 mg daily) or placebo for 5 weeks, and 67 were evaluated for 12 additional weeks on maximally tolerated doses of blinded study drugs. Treatment groups were evaluated with respect to symptoms of heart failure, indexes of quality of life and left ventricular function, frequency and type of arrhythmia, adverse events, and mortality rates. Doxazosin (11.9 +/- 0.9 mg) given once daily produced a favorable trend in the investigators' and patients' assessments of symptomatic change. Doxazosin was associated with a significantly higher level of voluntary submaximal exercise and a favorable trend on left ventricular ejection fraction (increase of 9.8% of the baseline value vs 2.7% with placebo; p = NS). During the 3-month steady-dosing period, patients treated with doxazosin had a significant (p less than 0.004) reduction in ventricular arrhythmias and significantly fewer morbid and mortal cardiac events (including episodes of worsening heart failure severe enough to prompt discontinuation of the study, myocardial infarction, and death). Doxazosin was well tolerated, producing no major side effects and only a slightly higher frequency of minor treatment-related side effects compared with placebo (p = NS). 
2	Historical review of pancreaticoduodenectomy. The performance of pancreaticoduodenectomy by Whipple in 1935 demonstrated that the operation was feasible technically and compatible with reasonable function after recovery. From the mid- to late 1940s until the last 10 years, the procedure was condemned by many because of its associated mortality and morbidity. For reasons that are not clear, the risk of pancreaticoduodenectomy in the last 10 years has fallen to less than 10% and in several centers, less than 5%. Postoperative complications have been reduced and blood transfusions are unnecessary in an increasing number of patients. Furthermore, a normal productive life without the need for medication and with no digestive disorder is expected. Seventy-one percent of patients are able to return to their preoperative occupation. 
3	Atrial fibrillation in the elderly: management update. Non-valvular atrial fibrillation is associated with a markedly increased risk of embolic stroke in elderly persons. Evidence is accumulating that anticoagulation with warfarin or aspirin may be effective in reducing this risk. 
3	Rigid fixation of internal orbital fractures. When large portions of the internal orbit are destroyed (two to four walls), standard bone-grafting techniques for immediate and late orbital reconstruction may not yield predictable eye position. Critical bone support is most often deficient inferomedially. CT analysis of orbital volume in cases where eye position was unsatisfactory reveals that displacement of bone grafts is one mechanism of the unsatisfactory result. Other mechanisms include undercorrection and bone-graft resorption. In order to minimize postoperative bone-graft displacement, titanium implants were used to span large defects in the internal orbit to provide a platform for bone-graft support. Twenty-six implants were placed in immediate and 12 were placed in late orbital reconstructions. More reliable bone-graft position resulted. Two late infections have occurred resulting in implant removal in a 3-year period. 
5	Covalent binding of oxidative biotransformation intermediates is associated with halothane hepatotoxicity in guinea pigs. In vivo covalent binding of halothane biotransformation-reactive intermediates to hepatic protein and lipid was examined in association with the subsequent development of hepatic necrosis in the guinea pig. Oxidative halothane biotransformation was inhibited by the use of deuterated halothane, whereas reductive metabolism was enhanced by low inspired oxygen concentrations. Male outbred Hartley guinea pigs (n = 8) were exposed to either 1% (v/v) halothane or deuterated halothane--with a fractional inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 0.40 or 0.10--for 4 h. Livers removed from half of the animals immediately after anesthesia were evaluated for organic fluorine bound to protein and lipid. The remaining animals were evaluated for a hepatotoxic response up to 96 h after exposure. Only guinea pigs that received 1% halothane at an FIO2 of 0.40 had centrilobular necrosis develop with significantly increased plasma alanine aminotransferase activities. All other treatment conditions significantly reduced oxidative halothane biotransformation, as indicated by decreased plasma trifluoroacetic acid concentrations. These reductions were associated with a significant decrease in organic fluorine bound to hepatic proteins. An FIO2 of 0.10 during halothane anesthesia significantly enhanced reductive biotransformation, as indicated by plasma fluoride ion concentrations. This was associated with a significant increase in organic fluoride bound to hepatic lipids. Centrilobular necrosis did not develop under these conditions. Thus, covalent binding to subcellular proteins by the trifluoroacetyl acid chloride intermediate generated by oxidative halothane biotransformation is implicated as a mechanism of centrilobular necrosis in guinea pigs. Binding to lipids by reductive pathway generated free radicals does not appear to be involved in production of the lesion. 
1	Incidence and properties of renal masses and asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma detected by abdominal ultrasonography. Renal ultrasonography was performed in 45,905 adults, including 41,364 without any signs suggesting urinary tract malignancies, 1,667 with microscopic hematuria only and 2,874 with some signs of malignancy. Renal lesions were found in 355 adults (0.858%) in the asymptomatic, 39 (2.3%) in the microscopic hematuria and 75 (2.6%) in the symptomatic groups, respectively. Renal cell carcinoma was found in 35 (7.5%) lesions: 19 (5.4%) in the asymptomatic, none in the microscopic hematuria and 16 (21.3%) in the symptomatic groups. A total of 47 patients, including 12 other renal cell carcinoma patients transferred from related hospitals, was grouped into 28 without and 19 with symptoms. Primary tumor size and clinical stages were significantly smaller and lower, respectively, in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group. Radical nephrectomy was performed in all but 2 asymptomatic patients. The 5-year survival rates after nephrectomy were 94.7 and 60.9% for the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups, respectively (p less than 0.01). The results indicate that ultrasonography is a useful tool to detect low stage asymptomatic renal cell carcinoma at low cost. 
5	Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and postnatal viral labyrinthitis: a statistical comparison of temporal bone findings. Although the cause of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains uncertain, a viral origin has been suggested in many cases on the basis of anamnestic microbiologic and pathologic data. Twenty-two temporal bone specimens from 18 patients who during life suffered a sudden partial or complete sensorineural hearing loss were studied. On the basis of clinical data, these cases were assigned to one of three diagnostic categories, and the temporal bones were studied by light microscopy and serial section analysis. The implications of the histopathologic findings for the pathogenesis of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss are discussed. 
1	Extracolonic malignancies in inflammatory bowel disease. A population-based cohort with inflammatory bowel disease consisting of 4776 patients (3121 with ulcerative colitis and 1655 with Crohn's disease) was followed for 1 to 50 years for the occurrence of malignant neoplasms. Two hundred eighty-three cancers were observed versus 189.1 expected (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 1.5, 95% confidence limits [CL] 1.3 to 1.7). One hundred seventy-eight extracolonic cancers were observed versus 168.8 expected (SIR = 1.1, 95% CL 0.9 to 1.2). In Crohn's disease and extensive ulcerative colitis, observed cases were close to those expected but in ulcerative proctitis, the relative risk of extracolonic cancers was close to significantly increased (SIR = 1.3, 95% CL 1.0 to 1.7). Squamous skin cancers after Crohn's disease (SIR = 5.5, 95% CL 2.0 to 11.9) and connective tissue cancers after ulcerative colitis (SIR = 4.0, 95% CL 1.0 to 10.2) were significantly increased. Those having extensive ulcerative colitis at diagnosis had an increased risk of brain cancers (SIR = 2.4, 95% CL 1.0 to 4.6). Patients with extensive ulcerative colitis had lower than expected risk of breast cancer (SIR = 0.4, 95% CL 0.1 to 1.0). 
5	Epidermal nevus syndrome: a neurologic variant with hemimegalencephaly, gyral malformation, mental retardation, seizures, and facial hemihypertrophy. The epidermal nevus syndrome (ENS) is a sporadic neurocutaneous disorder that consists of epidermal nevi and congenital anomalies involving the brain and other systems. From among over 60 patients with ENS presenting with neurologic manifestations, we identified 17 who had hemimegalencephaly based on pathologic or radiologic studies. Associated brain and neurologic abnormalities included gyral malformations in 12 of 12, mental retardation in 13 of 14, seizures in 16 of 17 (including 9 with infantile spasms), and contralateral hemiparesis in 7 of 12. All had ipsilateral epidermal nevi of the head, and several had ipsilateral facial hemihypertrophy. We concluded that these abnormalities comprise a recognizable neurologic variant of ENS that we believe represents the full expression of primary brain involvement. Several patients also had evidence of acquired brain lesions such as infarcts, atrophy, porencephaly, and calcifications, which are best explained by prior ischemia or hemorrhage. Given repeated observations of blood vessel anomalies in ENS patients, we hypothesize that underlying vascular dysplasia predisposes to these acquired lesions. The same cause may be invoked to explain the wide variety of neurologic symptoms reported in ENS patients without hemimegalencephaly. While the cause of ENS remains unknown, several observations suggest a somatic mutation. 
1	A provider's view of prevention approaches in a prepaid group practice. Kaiser Permanente's health care delivery system and its efforts to integrate public health preventive medicine and curative medicine are described. The author advocates an increased focus on prepaid delivery systems like Kaiser Permanente as the best vehicle to achieve the full promise of health screening, health education, and life-style modification. Because these systems have brought the proper incentives into alignment, prevention and health promotion have become effective tools to achieve cost containment goals. A number of Kaiser Permanente projects are highlighted that demonstrate integration of public health preventive medicine and curative medicine: the Northern California Region's uniform health appraisal examination, which is linked with health education and counseling; the Colorado Region's breast cancer screening program, which is expected to show a higher rate of early breast cancer detection than in the general population; cooperative efforts with two Northern California towns to reduce smoking through a community-wide project; educational theatre programs aimed at early intervention and education of children before high-risk behaviors have become established life-style; and research projects that are possible because of an integrated program. Also, several forces that could endanger integrated systems including cost control practices of employers and insurers, and public policy such as mandating specific benefits, are noted. 
5	The neuromuscular pathology of the Eosinophilia-Myalgia syndrome. The Eosinophilia-Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) is a recently reorganized disorder in patients ingesting pharmacologic doses of L-tryptophan. We studied the lesions of skeletal muscle, peripheral nerve and skin in 12 cases of EMS. Perimyositis was severe in four, moderate in two, mild in three and absent in three cases. The lesions contained many eosinophils, T-helper cells, mast cells and activated macrophages. Type 2 myofiber atrophy was present in five cases and in one, this was the only pathologic finding. Severe epineurial inflammation was seen in the three sural nerve biopsies. Indirect evidence for peripheral neurologic involvement in three other cases consisted of inflammation surrounding intramuscular nerve twigs (two cases) and neurogenic atrophy (one case). Phlebitis accompanied the connective tissue inflammation in five cases and endarteritis in one. Fasciitis was present in three of four skin biopsies and dermal fibrosis in one. 
1	Prosthetic arthroplasty of the knee after resection of a sarcoma in the proximal end of the tibia. A report of sixteen cases. The results of a specific type of prosthetic reconstruction of the knee (total replacement arthroplasty) after resection of a sarcoma of the proximal part of the tibia in sixteen patients were retrospectively reviewed. The diagnosis was stage-IIB osteogenic sarcoma in nine patients, stage-IIB malignant fibrous histiocytoma in three patients, and stage-IB sarcoma of various types in four patients. The length of tibial resection ranged from 100 to 257 millimeters. Of the eleven patients who were available for functional examination (mean duration of follow-up, sixty-three months), three patients had an excellent result, seven had a good result, and one had a fair result. Of the five patients who were not available for functional testing, one who was doing well was lost to follow-up at eighty months, one had died of metastases at sixteen months, and three had had a secondary amputation for infection or for loosening of the prosthesis. 
4	Doppler echocardiographic comparison of the Carpentier and Duran anuloplasty rings versus no ring after mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation. To compare the hemodynamic results of different anuloplasty techniques of primary valve repair for mitral regurgitation, 122 patients were prospectively studied with Doppler echocardiograms 5 to 10 days after operation. Seventy-seven patients had mitral valve prolapse, 27 had coronary artery disease, 13 patients had rheumatic mitral valve lesions and 5 patients had infective endocarditis. Forty-eight patients received the flexible Duran ring, 46 received the more rigid Carpentier ring and 28 patients received no ring. Doppler echocardiography demonstrated a significant decrease in mitral valve area estimated by the pressure half-time method in patients who received either a Carpentier (2.6 +/- 0.8 cm2) or Duran ring (2.8 +/- 0.8 cm2) when compared with patients who received no ring (3.2 +/- 0.7 cm2) (p = 0.01). No significant differences were observed for peak transmitral diastolic velocity, peak transmitral diastolic gradient, or the grade of mitral regurgitation by color flow Doppler mapping between patients with and without rings. The etiology of mitral disease and concomitant surgical procedures accompanying mitral valve repair did not significantly influence mitral valve area, peak velocity or peak gradient. These data suggest that Carpentier and Duran rings decrease the hemodynamic mitral valve area; however, the decrease in valve area is small and not associated with a clinically important increase in transvalvular gradient. 
1	Elevated insulin receptor content in human breast cancer. The growth of breast cancer cells is under the regulation of hormones, growth factors, and their receptors. In the present study, we have employed a new, sensitive, and specific radioimmunoassay for the direct measurement of insulin receptors in surgical specimens of breast cancers. In 159 specimens the insulin receptor content was 6.15 +/- 3.69 ng/0.1 mg protein. This value was more than sixfold higher than the mean value found in both 27 normal breast tissues obtained at total mastectomy (0.95 + 0.68, P less than 0.001) and in six normal specimens obtained from reduction mammoplasty (0.84 +/- 0.78, P less than 0.001). The insulin receptor content in breast cancer tissues was also higher than in any normal tissue investigated including liver (Pezzino, V., V. Papa, V. Trischitta, A. Brunetti, P.A. Goodman, M.K. Treutelaar, J.A. Williams, B.A. Maddux, R. Vigneri, and I.D. Goldfine, 1989. Am. J. Physiol. 257:E451-457). The insulin receptor in breast cancer retained its ability to both bind insulin and undergo insulin-induced tyrosine kinase activation. Immunostaining of the specimens revealed that the insulin receptor was present in malignant epithelial cells, but was not detected in stromal and inflammatory cells. Univariant analysis revealed that the insulin receptor content of the tumors correlated positively with tumor size (P = 0.014), histological grading (P = 0.030), and the estrogen receptor content (P = 0.035). There were no significant correlations between insulin receptor content and the age, body weight, menopausal status, and nodal involvement of the patients. These studies indicate, therefore, that the insulin receptor content is increased in breast cancers and raise the possibility that the insulin receptor may have a role in the biology of these tumors. 
2	Neuromuscular disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastrointestinal motility is the function of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. It is controlled by both the intrinsic and extrinsic nerves of the gastrointestinal tract and, to a lesser degree, the gastrointestinal hormones. Therefore, any abnormality of the above factors, theoretically, can cause gastrointestinal dysmotility. In a clinical situation, commonly seen is gastrointestinal dysmotility caused by either smooth muscle or intrinsic and extrinsic nerves dysfunction. Diseases that cause smooth muscle dysfunction include familial visceral myopathies, nonfamilial visceral myopathies, collagen disease, muscular dystrophies, amyloidosis, thyroid disease, and so on. Diseases that cause enteric nerve dysfunction include familial visceral neuropathies, nonfamilial visceral neuropathies, diabetes mellitus, Chagas' disease, ganglioneuromatosis of the intestine, visceral neuropathy of carcinomatosis, Parkinson's disease, and so on. The patients with neuromuscular disease of the gastrointestinal tract have a wide range of clinical manifestations regardless of the underlying cause. At one end of the spectrum, the patients may be asymptomatic, and at the other end of the spectrum, the patients may have functional obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract. Plain abdominal x-rays, upper gastrointestinal (UGI) and small bowel x-rays, enteroclysis, barium enema, and manometric studies are useful for the work-up of these patients. Enteroclysis is especially helpful in ruling out mechanical obstruction of the small intestine in patients with chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. There is no effective drug to improve gastrointestinal motility. Surgery may be helpful in selected cases of severe gastrointestinal dysmotility. 
5	Diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible: a new concept of its etiology. Diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible is a disease of unknown etiology. The clinical and radiographic findings suggest an infectious origin, but bacteriologic and histologic findings do not support this concept. Analysis of clinical symptoms, localization of the condition, and posttreatment findings in a group of 27 patients suggest a chronic tendoperiostitis due to muscular overuse as an etiologic factor in diffuse sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible. This hypothesis was supported by the initial results of muscle relaxation treatment in 13 of these patients. 
1	Integrated magnetic resonance imaging and phosphorus spectroscopy of soft tissue tumors. Eighteen patients with soft tissue masses underwent integrated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and phosphorus spectroscopy (31P-MRS) to evaluate benign and malignant tumor morphology and metabolism. Spectra from soft tissue tumors had a significantly higher proportion of phosphate in the low-energy portion of the 31P spectrum (P less than 0.001) with a concomitant decrease in phosphocreatine (P less than 0.01) compared with 31P spectra from normal muscle. Malignant tumors had a mean pH of 7.35 +/- 0.13 which was greater than that of muscle tissue with a mean pH of 7.08 +/- 0.07 (P less than 0.001). All tumors had greater relative levels of phosphomonoesters, inorganic phosphate, and phosphodiesters compared with those in muscle tissue but considerable variability among tumors was noted due to tumor size, extent of tumor necrosis, and muscle contamination. Integrated MRI/MRS studies are necessary to provide exact localization of the tumor and a more correct interpretation of the 31P-MRS data. 
4	Injuries to the cervical spine causing vertebral artery trauma: case reports. In four patients with lesions of the vertebral artery resulting from cervical spine injury, two were due to unilateral facet dislocation and two to fractures of the dens. There was one arterial occlusion with minor vertebrobasilar symptoms, and an arterial lesion with thrombosis causing embolic occlusion of the basilar artery with lethal outcome. In one patient a fresh fracture of the dens caused dislocation of C1/2 with reversible occlusion of the left and stenosis of the right vertebral artery, resulting in unconsciousness. In a patient with pseudarthrosis of the dens an aneurysm of the vertebral artery could be detected. Cerebellar or cerebral symptoms associated with cervical spine injury should be investigated by vertebral angiography because vertebral arterial injury may be more common than suspected and may simulate traumatic brain damage. 
5	Acute complications of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty for total occlusion. The incidence of major complications after percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of a totally occluded artery was assessed retrospectively. A total of 1649 PTCA procedures were analyzed. After exclusion of procedures for acute myocardial infarction or total occlusion that resulted from restenosis, 90 patients were selected. Forty-four patients (49%) had stable angina and 46 (51%) had unstable angina. The estimated duration of occlusion was 87 +/- 78 days in patients with stable angina, as compared with 10 +/- 8 days in patients with unstable angina (p less than 0.001). Abrupt vessel closure during PTCA occurred only in patients with unstable angina (0% versus 17%, p less than 0.05). The major complication rate was 2.5% in the stable angina group, and 20% in unstable angina group (p less than 0.01). This rate was also significantly higher than the complication rate of 8% observed in 442 procedures that were performed during the same period in patients with the unstable angina and nonocclusive stenosis (p less than 0.01). Patients with unstable angina who undergo PTCA of a totally occluded artery represent a subset of high risk for major complications. 
5	Clinical management issues in males with sex chromosomal mosaicism and discordant phenotype/sex chromosomal patterns. The recent availability of Y DNA probes has made it possible to identify two forms of 46,XX male syndrome: Y DNA positive and Y DNA negative. The Y DNA positive male results from a X;Y translocation with a low recurrence risk; the Y DNA negative males are due to a mutation with a high recurrence risk. 46,XX males and mosaic forms are phenotypically indistinguishable. A review of the case histories for 11 individuals indicates that affected males have highly variable genital and nongenital phenotypes. Physical findings may be clearly apparent or nonexistent. With the exception of external genitalia, the basis for this variability is unknown. It may be related to differences in Y chromatin expression as the result of variable inactivation of the X chromosomes, or to the existence of minor deletions or point mutations secondary to an exchange of genetic material. Common and uncommon clinical problems in these individuals require evaluation and follow-up care that is provided through a cooperative, interdisciplinary approach. 
5	Alternation of gastric mucosal glycoprotein (lectin-binding pattern) in gastric mucosa in stress. A light and electron microscopic study. Gastric mucosal cells of the rat glandular stomach were studied by light and electron microscopic procedures by use of lectins in the development of acute gastric mucosal lesions. Effects of the H2-receptor antagonist sofalcone (2'carboxymethoxy-4,4'-bis 3-methyl-2) and truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty on lectin binding sites and distribution were also investigated. Biotinylated lectins in combination with ABC (avidin-biotinyl peroxidase complex) method were used for light and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled lectins for electron microscopic studies. Gastric mucosal cells showed the specific binding pattern for each lectin by light microscopy. Especially, binding sites and distribution of peanut agglutinin (PNA) were characteristic after induction of stress, truncal vagotomy, and administration of each drug. Staining and distribution increased in the gastric mucosa upward and downward after that. In electron microscopic studies, PNA strongly stained the membranes of the intracellular secretory canaliculi of a parietal cell. These results suggested that alternation of binding sites and distribution was regulated by change of gastric mucosal blood flow and of acidity in the parietal cells. Therefore, increase of glycoconjugate distribution is supposed to be a possibility of cytoprotective effect for a change of environment in the parietal cells. 
1	Prevention and changing demographics. The underserved and cancer. This paper illustrates the complexity of the "cancer control in the underserved" problem, especially as it is affected currently, and will be in the future, by the multiple demographic changes in the United States. It does so by extensively quoting from four rather different articles by authors from a variety of backgrounds in health, management, and economics. Another issue is that although the articles quoted refer mainly to secondary and tertiary prevention, they do apply equally to primary prevention and health promotion. Furthermore, the twin issues of priority and ethnic/cultural differences need to be addressed insofar as they affect health risks, risk reduction efforts, early diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation/disability reduction. Finally, the point is made that social and structural change of this magnitude cannot occur in the health care system and society at large without the allocation of discrete private and public sector resources. 
2	Paraileostomy hernia: a clinical and radiological study. Forty-six patients who underwent colectomy with end ileostomy for ulcerative colitis (n = 33) or Crohn's disease (n = 13) have been reviewed for paraileostomy hernia (PIH) formation 1-16 years after surgery. PIH developed in 13 of these patients (28 per cent) and was not related to the original disease or excessive weight gain. Twenty-eight patients underwent limited computed tomography (CT) scanning of the stomal region. Eight of these had a clinically detectable PIH, which was demonstrated on CT. A further two patients had PIH demonstrated on CT which was not detected by clinical examination. The rate of PIH was similar where the stoma emerged lateral to the rectus abdominis muscle (six out of 16 patients, 37 per cent) to where the stoma emerged through the rectus (four out of 12 patients, 33 per cent). Recurrence following operative repair of PIH was common. PIH occurs more frequently than previously supposed. CT can detect PIH and may be useful in evaluating a patient with stoma-related symptoms for occult PIH formation. 
5	Expression of transcobalamin II receptors by human leukemia K562 and HL-60 cells. Plasma membrane receptors for the serum cobalamin-binding protein transcobalamin II (TCII) were identified on human leukemia K562 and HL-60 cells using immunoaffinity-purified human TCII labeled with [57Co]cyanocobalamin. The Bmax values for TCII receptors on proliferating K562 and HL-60 cells were 4,500 and 2,700 per cell, respectively. Corresponding dissociation constants (kd) were 8.0 x 10(-11) mol/L and 9.0 x 10(-11) mol/L. Rabbit TCII also bound to K562 and HL-60 cells but with slightly reduced affinities. Calcium was required for the binding of transcobalamin II to K562 cells. Brief treatment of these cells with trypsin resulted in almost total loss of surface binding activity. After removal of trypsin, surface receptors for TCII slowly reappeared, reaching pretrypsin treatment densities only after 24 hours. Reappearance of receptors was blocked by cycloheximide. TCII receptor densities on K562 and HL-60 cells correlated inversely with the concentration of cobalamin in the culture medium. This suggests that intracellular stores of cobalamin may affect the expression of transcobalamin receptors. Nonproliferating stationary-phase K562 cells had low TCII receptor densities (less than 1,200 receptors/cell). However, the density of TCII receptors increased substantially when cells were subcultured in fresh medium. Up-regulation of receptor expression coincided with increased 3H-thymidine incorporation, which preceded the resumption of cellular proliferation as measured by cell density. In the presence of cytosine arabinoside, which induces erythroid differentiation, K562 cells down-regulated expression of TCII receptors. When HL-60 cells were subcultured in fresh medium containing dimethysulfoxide to induce granulocytic differentiation, the up-regulation of TCII receptors was suppressed. This event occurred well before a diminution of 3H-thymidine incorporation and cessation of proliferation. Thus, changes in the regulation of expression of TCII receptors correlate with both the proliferative and differentiation status of cells. 
5	Molecular evolution of inversions in Drosophila pseudoobscura: the amylase gene region. The amylase region of the third chromosome of Drosophila pseudoobscura has been cloned and localized to cytological band 73A. It is contained within a series of highly polymorphic inversions and serves as a convenient tool for a molecular evolutionary analysis of the inverted gene arrangements. Amylase in D. pseudoobscura is a family of three genes, and some chromosomes have deletions for one or two of them. Two overlapping clones covering 26 kilobases were isolated and used as probes to survey DNA restriction map polymorphism among 28 lines, representing five of the major inversion types found in natural populations, as well as single chromosomes from the closely related species Drosophila persimilis and Drosophila miranda. Restriction-site differences are considerably greater among the various gene arrangements than among chromosomes with the same gene arrangement. Clustering the restriction map haplotypes yielded a dendrogram concordant with the phylogeny generated independently from cytogenetic considerations. The inversion polymorphism is estimated to be about 2 million years old. 
1	Receptor imaging: application to MR imaging of liver cancer. A new contrast agent for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, directed to asialoglycoprotein (ASG) receptors on hepatocytes, was used for detection of liver cancer in rats. Ultrasmall superparamagnetic (mean size, 12 nm) particles of iron oxide (USPIOs) were targeted to ASG receptors by coating particles with arabinogalactan (AG). Liver T2 relaxation times decreased more effectively after a single intravenous administration of AG-USPIO than after an equal dose of a conventional superparamagnetic liver MR contrast agent (AMI-25; mean size, 72 nm). Receptor affinity studies demonstrated that receptor-mediated attachment and subsequent cellular endocytosis do not occur in primary malignant (hepatocellular carcinoma) or metastatic (adenocarcinoma) tumors, because the surface ASG receptors are lost during malignant dedifferentiation. In vitro relaxation and in vivo MR imaging experiments of liver tumors show that targeting USPIO to hepatocytes rather than to the mononuclear phagocytic system allows a considerable dose reduction, increases tumor-liver contrast, and potentially allows distinction of ASG-positive (benign hepatocellular) and ASG-negative (malignant hepatocellular) tumors. 
3	Preventing stroke by the modification of risk factors. Epidemiologic research has revealed the major risk factors in cerebrovascular disease. This review will concentrate on three important risk factors: elevated blood pressure, the most common and important, since it is responsible for up to 70% of all strokes; raised cholesterol; and smoking. These factors are important not only because they increase the risk of stroke, but also because they are amenable to modification by drugs, diet, or other interventions. Strategies to avoid stroke can either 1) try to produce substantial reductions, usually with drugs, in the level of the risk factor in the few individuals in the population with high levels (the "high-risk" approach), or 2) try to produce modest reductions in the level of the risk factor in every individual in the population, usually not with drugs but with lifestyle modification (the "mass" approach). The prevention of stroke could best be achieved through continuing medical efforts to deal with high-risk individuals and through political strategies to encourage a healthier lifestyle in the population as a whole. 
4	Results of infrainguinal bypass for limb salvage in patients with end-stage renal disease. Limb salvage in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is complicated by the diffuse, obstructive, calcific arteriopathy that makes anastomotic technique especially critical. Furthermore, decreased resistance to infection and impaired wound healing produced by host-factor deficiencies such as diabetes mellitus, hypoalbuminemia, uremia, and immunosuppression produce additional obstacles to successful limb salvage. This report summarizes our experience with distal arterial bypass procedures in these patients. A total of 32 bypass procedures were performed for limb salvage in 24 patients (17 diabetic) during a period of 5 years. The operative mortality rate was 6%. During the same period, 635 infrainguinal bypass procedures were performed by the in situ technique in patients without ESRD. Primary bypass patency was comparable in both groups at 24 months (92% vs 90%). In the group with ESRD, overall limb salvage was 83% at 2 years. Life-table analysis of bypass patency and limb salvage was thought not to be appropriate in the population with ESRD beyond 2 years because of the increased mortality rate (38%; 9/24) during this interval. It is important that limb salvage was achieved in diabetic patients with ESRD in the presence of extensive foot gangrene or ischemic ulceration. Revascularization should be considered strongly for limb salvage in all patients in this difficult population. 
5	In vitro model of intestinal crypt abscess. A novel neutrophil-derived secretagogue activity. In order to model crypt abscesses, a histological finding which correlates with disease activity in intestinal inflammation, human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were layered onto monolayers of the human intestinal epithelial cell line T84, a crypt-like epithelium which is capable of Cl- secretion. Such PMN-epithelial interaction had no substantial effect on monolayer integrity or function. However, when PMN were stimulated by conditions including those present naturally in the human colonic lumen, monolayers responded with a bumetanide-sensitive short circuit current (Isc) indicative of Cl- secretion, the basis of secretory diarrhea. This Isc response was induced by a neutrophil-derived secretagogue (NDS), which was only active when applied to the luminal surface of monolayers and did not require PMN-epithelial contact. NDS activity is resistant to boiling, acid, and trypsin and passes a 500 nominal mol wt cutoff filter. NDS activity is not secondary to the respiratory burst products O2- or H2O2 and does not appear to be a myeloperoxidase product. We speculate NDS elicited Cl- secretion may contribute to the secretory diarrhea seen in patients with intestinal inflammation and crypt abscesses. 
5	Differential protective effects of halothane and isoflurane against hypoxic and reoxygenation injury in the isolated guinea pig heart. The authors investigated the effects of halothane (HAL) and isoflurane (ISO) on cardiac depression produced by global hypoxia and the recovery of function following reoxygenation is isolated guinea pig hearts perfused with Krebs' solution at constant pressure. Isovolumetric left ventricular systolic (LVSP) and end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP) were measured by placing a saline filled, latex balloon into the left ventricle. Bipolar electrodes were placed in the right atrium and right ventricle for measurements of heart rate (HR), atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT), and determination of the incidence and severity of dysrhythmias occurring during hypoxia and reoxygenation. Hearts were divided into three groups: control (n = 20), halothane (n = 12), and isoflurane (n = 13). All hearts were exposed in sequence to oxygenated perfusate (PO2, 530 mmHg), moderately hypoxic perfusate (PO2, 91 mmHg) for 30 min, and then to oxygenated perfusate for 40 min. Halothane (1%, 0.4 mM) or isoflurane (1.5%, 0.5 mM) were administered 10 min before hypoxia, during hypoxia, and during the first 10 min of reoxygenation. Exposure to halothane and isoflurane before hypoxia produced a 14 and 11% decrease in heart rate, a 32 and 23% increase in AVCT, and a 47 and 28% decrease in LVSP (all P less than or equal to 0.001) for halothane and isoflurane, respectively, and no significant change in LVEDP. During hypoxia, HR decreased and AVCT increased similarly in both groups. Left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) decreased sharply with a narrowing of the prehypoxic differences among the groups. In the control and isoflurane groups, LVEDP increased during hypoxia but remained unchanged in the halothane group. 
2	Nitrite from inflammatory cells--a cancer risk factor in ulcerative colitis? Elevated levels of luminal nitrite and a lowered luminal pH were found in 77 percent of patients with acute ulcerative colitis. No luminal nitrite was found in healthy control subjects. Nitrites are a secretory product of activated macrophages and neutrophils of the lamina propria, whereas the lowered luminal pH is due to diminished bicarbonate formation by impaired colonocytes. A hypothesis is put forward that nitrites, lowered pH, and bacterial amines are conducive to formation of carcinogenic n-nitroso compounds, which reflect a cancer risk in patients with ulcerative colitis dependent on the type and extent of inflammatory cell activation as well as metabolic impairment of colonic epithelial cells. 
1	Primary prevention of cancer. The case for comprehensive school health education. Comprehensive school health education plays an important role in the primary prevention of cancer because so many of the health habits relating to cancer and other diseases have their onset early in life. A comprehensive health education program should begin early in life. Such education must be multifactorial from kindergarten through high school, should involve annual health screening, must be assessed annually, and is most effective when coordinated by a full-time health education teacher. Those concerned about the many problems of health behavior in our society should insist that such programs become mandatory in every state in this nation. 
5	Edwards' syndrome after the replacement of cryopreserved-thawed embryos. A case of Edwards' syndrome after the replacement of frozen-thawed embryos is reported. The presence of cardiac abnormalities and limb deformities raised the suspicion of chromosomal abnormality. The diagnosis of trisomy 18 was made by cytogenetic analysis of fetal blood from the umbilical vein. The chromosomal nondisjunction might have been spontaneous or because of freezing and thawing. If it occurred as a result of freezing and thawing, it is more likely that this was at the first cleavage division rather than the second meiotic division because the embryos were frozen at the late pronuclear stage. Unfortunately, there were no karyotypic markers in the couple's chromosomes to time the nondisjunction. The wisdom of using donor oocytes in an ovum donation program from patients with long-standing infertility is questioned.
