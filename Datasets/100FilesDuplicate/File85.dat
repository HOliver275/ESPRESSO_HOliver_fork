Noninvasive detection of functionally significant coronary artery stenoses with exercise and positron emission tomography. Positron emission tomography has been employed in vivo to assess flow using N-13 (nitrogen-13) ammonia and glucose metabolism, with the glucose analog F-18 (fluorine-18) fluorodeoxyglucose. Flow metabolism mismatches in which glucose metabolism is increased with respect to flow have been used to define ischemic, but viable myocardium. The feasibility of detecting exercise-induced ischemia using this technique was explored. Eleven normal volunteers and 16 patients who had undergone coronary arteriography were studied with N-13 ammonia at rest and with bicycle exercise, and with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose in the postexercise period. Each image was divided into 16 sectors. Comparison of absolute net extractions of N-13 ammonia at rest and with exercise was not sensitive in detecting functionally significant coronary artery lesions. Myocardial uptakes of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose and exercise N-13 ammonia were normalized to the sector with the highest N-13 ammonia uptake (corresponding to the highest flow rate). The differences and ratios of these normalized uptakes were successfully used to objectively define flow metabolism mismatches and to identify functionally significant coronary artery disease. Our data suggest that exercise flow and metabolic imaging are superior to rest and exercise flow imaging, particularly in patients with prior myocardial infarctions. 
Primary resection and anastomosis in obstructed descending colon due to cancer. Intraoperative colonic irrigation followed by one-stage resection is gaining popularity as the optimal surgical treatment for left-sided colonic obstruction. However, its efficacy and potential hazards have not been adequately tested in obstruction due to colonic cancer. We analyzed the early results of 23 consecutive patients with obstructive left-sided colonic carcinoma treated by primary resection and anastomosis following intraoperative antegrade colonic lavage. Two patients (8.6%) died, one from complication of anastomotic leakage. The significant postoperative complications were chest infection in three (13%) and wound infection in seven (30.4%). The average hospital stay was 16.5 days. The results of this study suggest that intraoperative bowel irrigation permits one-stage resection and anastomosis to be conducted with reasonable safety provided care is taken in operative techniques. 
Tobacco smoking as a risk factor for colon polyps. BACKGROUND: Data from a cancer screening project among pattern makers were used to evaluate the association between tobacco smoking and prevalence of colon polyps. METHODS: From 1981-1983, 549 White men were examined by flexible sigmoidoscopy and completed self-administered questionnaires including smoking histories. RESULTS: One or more colon polyps were detected in 76 men. Standardized prevalence rates (SPR) for polyps increased by smoking category (never smoked = 0.094; ex-smokers = 0.118, current smokers = 0.214) and by cigarettes per day, years of smoking, and pack-years among both current and ex-smokers. Both adenomatous and hyperplastic polyps showed an association with smoking while other types of polyps and polyps with unspecified histology did not. The risk associated with smoking was greater for polyps greater than one centimeter in diameter. An interaction with occupational exposures was suggested by a greater increase in the SPR for polyps among current smokers employed as pattern makers for more than 10 years than among current smokers similarly employed for 10 years or less. CONCLUSIONS: Since at least some colon polyps are considered precursor lesions to colon cancer, one of the most common cancers in the United States, this report suggests that the possible link between colon polyps and smoking deserves further evaluation. 
Risk stratification after myocardial infarction. Clinical overview. Many patients with an acute myocardial infarction can be stratified into subgroups that are at high risk for morbidity and mortality on the basis of clinical characteristics that indicate recurrent myocardial ischemia, persistent left ventricular dysfunction, and/or recurrent cardiac arrhythmias. In patients with uncomplicated myocardial infarction the assessment of symptoms, physical findings, and ECG changes during predischarge exercise testing often identifies patients at increased risk for further cardiac events. Because of the suboptimum sensitivity and specificity of the exercise ECG for detecting myocardial ischemia, myocardial perfusion imaging with 201Tl and/or assessment of global and segmental ventricular function by two-dimensional echocardiography or radionuclide cineangiography during or immediately after exercise are often added to the predischarge risk stratification. 
A new approach to the management of acute epistaxis. A new approach to the management of acute epistaxis is described using suction with the operating microscope to define the bleeding point prior to the application of hot wire cautery. This technique was shown to be completely successful in stopping haemorrhage in 82% of acute referrals in a prospective series of 33 patients. It resulted in a significant reduction both in the use of nasal packing and in the length of hospital stay compared with a group of controls treated by traditional means. It is proposed that in most cases of acute epistaxis the bleeding point is accessible to cautery and nasal packing should be reserved for a minority of refractory cases. This avoids unnecessary patient discomfort and the complications of prolonged nasal packing and hospitalization. 
Ber-ACT8: new monoclonal antibody to the mucosa lymphocyte antigen. Using a newly established HTLV-1 positive T cell line as an immunogen, a new monoclonal antibody, Ber-ACT8, was produced. It reacts with in vitro activated T cells and a small subset of normal resting T cells, but not with resting B cells or any of the 29 established human permanent cell lines tested. Immunohistological analysis of a wide spectrum of human tissues showed that Ber-ACT8 reactivity is restricted to a few T cells in the peripheral blood, the extrafollicular areas of lymph nodes and tonsils, and splenic red pulp. In the gut Ber-ACT8 labelled most intraepithelial T cells and up to 50% of lamina propria T cells. The antibody also immunostained T cells present in the oral and bronchial mucosa. Double labelling on splenic cells, fresh blood lymphocytes, and in vitro activated T cells showed that most Ber-ACT8 positive cells coexpressed CD8. Ber-ACT8 did not react with any of the 14 Hodgkin's lymphomas nor any of the 172 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas tested, with the exception of 10 cases of T cell lymphomas, five of which were located in the jejunum and associated with coeliac disease, and one B cell lymphoma, and most cases of hairy cell leukaemia tested. Parallel immunostainings with Ber-ACT8, anti-TCR-beta (beta F1), and anti-TCR-delta showed that most Ber-ACT8 positive T cells carry the TCR of alpha beta type. Comparison of Ber-ACT8 with HML-1, B-ly7, and LF61 showed essentially the same reactivity and an identical molecular target. The molecular structure recognised seems to be a trimeric molecule with components of 150, 125 and 105 kilodaltons, with the Ber-ACT8 epitope localised on the 150 kilodalton chain. The 150 kilodalton molecule contains an 0-linked carbohydrate moiety of about 10 kilodaltons. Because of its very selective distribution, the trimeric antigen is a powerful reagent for the diagnosis of gut T cell-derived T cell lymphomas and other extranodal T cell lymphomas, as well as hairy cell leukaemia. 
In vitro response of a human colon tumor xenograft and a lung adenocarcinoma cell line to alpha-difluoromethylornithine alone and in combination with 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin. We have investigated effects of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), both as a single agent and in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) against a human colon tumor xenograft (T6) grown as primary tissue culture in serum-free medium and in combination with doxorubicin (DX) against a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549). DFMO showed a dose-dependent growth-inhibitory effect against human colon tumor xenograft and lung adenocarcinoma cells. Growth-inhibitory activity of DFMO against T6 cells was reversed completely when the cells were treated simultaneously with putrescine (PU) (10(-6) M) and DFMO (10(-3) M). When 5-FU and DFMO were used in combination against T6 cells, no antagonism or synergism between the two drugs was seen. However, in the case of A549 cells, when DFMO was used in combination with DX, there was a consistent increase in growth inhibition that surpassed the inhibition of either agent given alone. 
Rhinocerebral mucormycosis: use of liposomal amphotericin B. Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a rare but often fatal condition characterized by an aggressive necrotizing infection spreading from the nose to the paranasal sinuses, orbit and hence to the central nervous system. A case is reported in which a diabetic male with advanced mucormycosis was successfully treated by a combination of surgery, supportive therapy and liposomal amphotericin B. Liposomal delivery allows the drug to be both less toxic and more effective, and this is the first reported case of its use in rhinocerebral mucormycosis. 
Successful treatment of a pineal endodermal sinus tumor. Case report. A patient with a pineal endodermal sinus tumor is presented who was successfully treated by a combination of surgery, adjuvant chemotherapy, and craniospinal irradiation. Two years after diagnosis, he is free of any disease. A review of the literature shows that such an outcome is very unusual. A multidisciplinary treatment is recommended for this rare tumor, using chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment. 
MR imaging of CSF-like choroidal fissure and parenchymal cysts of the brain. The purposes of this study were to delineate the MR characteristics of CSF-like parenchymal or fissural cysts of the brain and to correlate them with the clinical findings. Clinical data and MR images of 34 patients with these abnormalities were reviewed. Pathologic correlation was not available. Two types of cystic lesions were identified and separated by location: medial temporal lobe cysts arising in or near the choroidal fissure (26 patients) and parenchymal or pseudoparenchymal cysts not related to the choroidal fissure (eight patients). The choroidal fissure cysts simulated intraparenchymal cysts on axial images but their extraaxial location was well portrayed on the coronal images. Choroidal fissure cysts had a characteristic spindle shape on sagittal images. The other cysts were found in the temporal lobe (seven patients) or thalamus (one patient) and appeared parenchymal but situated close to the subarachnoid space. These lesions were round or ovoid. There was no abnormal enhancement in 10 patients studied with gadopentetate dimeglumine. Coronal images were most useful, revealing the cysts as focal CSF-intensity lesions expanding the choroidal fissure of the temporal lobe. All the cysts appeared to represent incidental findings that did not correlate with the clinical signs and/or symptoms that prompted the imaging evaluations. The MR characteristics of CSF-like cysts are important to recognize so that they are not confused with other, more serious entities, such as intraaxial cystic tumors, infarctions, or parasitic lesions. 
Results of surgery for duodenal ulcer: assessment by patients. A questionnaire was administered to 224 patients who had undergone 246 operations for duodenal ulcer to see how well this correlated with Visick grading and to provide insight into the patients' feelings about the results of their surgery. The patients were divided into three groups by Visick grade: good (grade I, n = 70), satisfactory (grades II and IIIs, n = 104) and poor (grades IIIu and IV, n = 72). The distribution of questionnaire responses in each group was statistically different (P less than 0.01). Dividing the questionnaire responses into three corresponding groups, 72 per cent of patients assigned themselves to the same group as their Visick grade. Three observations were made regarding the Visick system: recurrent ulceration is over-scored and should be included only if symptomatic; grading should acknowledge a wider range of symptoms related to ulcer disease and its treatment; only three grades are necessary. 
Goniotomy technique for removal of anterior chamber intraocular lenses. Removal of an anterior chamber intraocular lens is often impeded by formation of peripheral anterior synechiae around one or more of the lens haptics. We describe a method of lysing adhesions under direct visualization through a contact gonioprism lens. This method is relatively atraumatic to vital anterior-chamber-angle structures. 
Effect of cyclo(Leu-Gly) on cyclic GMP-phosphodiesterase activity changes associated with development of tolerance to morphine-induced antinociception, catalepsy, respiratory depression and mydriasis. A biochemical basis for the development of tolerance to morphine has yet to be defined. Although a number of models have been proposed, none can account for complete tolerance to this drug. Previous studies in our laboratory indicated that the development of complete tolerance to certain morphine-induced behaviors (antinociception, catalepsy and respiratory depression) is associated with changes in the activity of some form(s) of phosphodiesterase with cyclic GMP as substrate (cGMP-PDE) activity in the brain areas that mediate these behaviors (periaqueductal gray, striatum and medulla). In the present study, experiments were performed in which Cyclo(Leu-Gly), a dipeptide that inhibits the development of tolerance to morphine, was administered daily (2 mg/kg) to morphine-naive rats, coadministered with morphine or coadministered with morphine to morphine-tolerant rats and the cGMP-PDE activity was measured. The development of tolerance to the effects was inhibited or reversed by administration of cyclo(Leu-Gly) and there were corresponding changes in cGMP-PDE activity in various brain regions. Differences in cGMP hydrolysis between brain regions from morphine-tolerant animals, tolerance-inhibited animals and tolerance-reversed animals strengthens the evidence for direct involvement of cGMP-PDE(s) in tolerance phenomena. 
Limited sampling models for doxorubicin pharmacokinetics. Although doxorubicin is one of the most commonly used antineoplastics, no studies to date have clearly related the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to toxicity or response. The limited sampling model has recently been shown to be a feasible method for estimating the AUC to facilitate pharmacodynamic studies. Data from two previous studies of doxorubicin pharmacokinetics were used, including 26 patients with sarcoma and five patients with breast cancer or unknown primary. The former were divided into a training data set of 15 patients and a test datum set of 11 patients, and the latter patients formed a second test data set. The model was developed by stepwise multiple regression on the training data set: AUC (nanogram hour per milliliter) = 17.39 C2 + 163 C48-111.0 [dose/(50 mg/m2)], where C2 and C48 are the concentrations at 2 and 48 hours after bolus dose. The model was subsequently validated on both test data sets: first test data set--mean predictive error (MPE), 4.7%; root mean square error (RMSE), 12.4%; second test data set--MPE, 4.5%, RMSE, 9.2%. An additional model was also generated using a simulated time point to estimate the total AUC for a daily x 3-day schedule: AUC (nanogram hour per milliliter) = 44.79 C2 + 175.65 C48 + 47.25 [dose/(25 mg/m2/d)], where the C48 is obtained just prior to the third dose. We conclude that the AUC of doxorubicin after bolus administration can be adequately estimated from two timed plasma concentrations. 
Acral pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma of children (APACHE): a case report and immunohistological study. Acral pseudolymphomatous angiokeratoma of children (APACHE) is a new clinical entity that is characterized by angiomatous papules on the extremities. We report a case APACHE in a 14-year-old Japanese girl with asymptomatic red and violaceous papules and nodules on the ring finger of the left hand. Histological and immunohistochemical studies of our patient indicated that APACHE is a pseudolymphoma rather than an angiokeratoma. 
Dopamine agonists prevent duodenal ulcer relapse. A comparative study with famotidine and cimetidine. The present study investigated both the healing rate (after four weeks) and the relapse rate (during six months) following treatment with the dopamine-like drugs bromocriptine (2.5 mg twice daily), amantadine (100 mg nocte), or with the H2 blockers cimetidine (800 mg nocte), and famotidine (40 mg nocte) in 124 patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcer (DU). The ulcer was completely healed in 27 (amantadine), 26 (bromocriptine), 23 (cimetidine), and in 24 (famotidine) patients. Relapse was noted in 34.7% (cimetidine) and 25% (famotidine) versus 11.7% (amantadine) and 7.7% (bromocriptine) DU patients. No significant difference was found in initial healing rates. However, the relapse rate in the cimetidine-treated group was significantly higher than in all the other test groups. Additional comparisons between all the treatment categories showed a significantly lower relapse rate with the dopamine-like agents. These important new results indicate that dopamine-like compounds are equally effective as H2 blockers in inducing DU healing and may offer a promising advantage over H2 blockers concerning their efficacy in preventing ulcer relapse in DU patients. 
Lysis of plasminogen activator-resistant platelet-rich coronary artery thrombus with combined bolus injection of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator and antiplatelet GPIIb/IIIa antibody. Resistance of coronary occlusive thrombus to thrombolytic therapy, found in some patients with acute myocardial infarction, may be due to the presence of platelet-rich coronary clot. Reperfusion therapy in such patients may require the development and evaluation of alternative strategies in animal models. Therefore, platelet-rich coronary artery thrombus was developed by excision, eversion (inside out) and reanastomosis of a 1 cm segment of the left circumflex coronary artery in anesthetized dogs maintained on heparin antiocoagulation. Blood flow was restored in 25 of 27 dogs. Thrombotic occlusion of the everted segment graft with primarily platelet-rich thrombus or thrombus containing platelet-rich and erythrocyte-rich zones, persisting for at least 30 min, occurred within 4.5 +/- 3.5 min (mean +/- SD) in 20 of these 25 dogs. In 5 of these 20 dogs (group I, control), stable occlusion, as monitored with an ultrasound flow probe and coronary angiography, was maintained during a 2 h observation period. In group II (n = 5), intravenous bolus injections of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a dose of 0.45 mg/kg body weight at four 15 min intervals did not cause reperfusion in four dogs and produced cyclic reperfusion and reocclusion in one dog. In group III (n = 5), a single intravenous bolus injection of 0.8 mg/kg of the F(ab')2 fragment of a murine monoclonal antibody (7E3) against the human platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor [7E3-F(ab')2] produced stable reperfusion in two of the five dogs, whereas occlusion persisted in the other three. In group IV (n = 5), injection of 7E3-F(ab')2 (0.8 mg/kg) followed by rt-PA (0.45 mg/kg) caused stable reperfusion without reocclusion in all dogs (p less than 0.05 versus rt-PA alone and p less than 0.01 versus control). This study confirms that platelet-rich occlusive coronary thrombus is very resistant to lysis with intravenous rt-PA. However, this resistance may be overcome by the combined use of a reduced dose of rt-PA and the antiplatelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antibody 7E3. The results indicate that platelet-rich thrombus resistant to thrombolytic agents may be dispersed pharmacologically without resort to mechanical recanalization. The present dog model may be useful in investigating specific strategies for the dispersion of resistant platelet-rich coronary thrombus. 
Effects of calcium chloride administration on the postischemic isolated rat heart. Hypercalcemic reperfusion of the postischemic heart has been associated with ventricular dysfunction and with ultrastructural changes in the mitochondria. The isolated working rat heart model was used to correlate ventricular function, mitochondrial damage, and high-energy phosphate content with degree and timing of hypercalcemia during reperfusion. When administered early during reperfusion, calcium chloride caused a dose-dependent deterioration in ventricular function, whereas calcium augmented function when it was administered after a 15-minute period of normocalcemic reperfusion. Hearts treated with calcium early during reperfusion demonstrated more mitochondrial damage and decreased stores of adenosine triphosphate than those in which calcium administration was delayed. The data indicate that a period of normocalcemic reperfusion should precede calcium administration in the postischemic heart. Mitochondrial damage resulting in decreased synthesis of adenosine triphosphate is likely the cause of ventricular dysfunction associated with calcium administration in the postischemic heart. 
Pelvic denervation for chronic pain associated with endometriosis: fact or fancy? The efficacy of presacral neurectomy and amputation of the uterosacral ligaments in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain has been debated for decades. These procedures used to be done mainly in women with normal pelves, but more recently they have been performed during conservative surgery for treatment of endometriosis. In the 1980s the rapid spread of laparoscopic surgery has led to an increasing number of endoscopic denervations in patients with chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis. However, an analysis of literature data has failed to prove that presacral neurectomy and amputation of the uterosacral ligaments are effective and did not demonstrate better results with the use of lasers rather than electrocoagulation. Moreover, no valid comparison has yet been made between laparotomy and laparoscopic methods. 
Effect of prior anesthetic solution on epidural morphine analgesia. The quality and duration of analgesia and incidence of side effects following epidurally administered morphine after cesarean section are highly variable. Two suggested sources of this variability are prior use of epinephrine-containing solutions, which may enhance both analgesia and side effects of morphine, and prior use of 2-chloroprocaine, which may inhibit epidural morphine analgesia. To examine these proposed sources of this variability we performed two studies. In the first, designed to test epinephrine's effect, 30 women underwent testing for epidural catheter tip location with injection of 2-chloroprocaine, followed by either 0.5% bupivacaine alone or 0.5% bupivacaine with 5 micrograms/mL epinephrine for epidural anesthesia. Inclusion of epinephrine with bupivacaine decreased the bupivacaine dose needed to achieve a T-4 sensory block by 24% (P less than 0.05), but did not alter analgesic duration or the incidence of side effects of epidural morphine (5 mg). In the second study, designed to test the effect of 2-chloroprocaine, 30 women received 7 mL of either 2% 2-chloroprocaine or lidocaine for epidural catheter testing, followed by 0.5% bupivacaine for epidural anesthesia. Compared to lidocaine testing, 2-chloroprocaine decreased the duration of epidural morphine analgesia (median 16 h with 2-chloroprocaine vs 24 h with lidocaine; P less than 0.05) without altering the incidence of side effects. The authors conclude that addition of epinephrine to local anesthetic does not increase the incidence of side effects or the analgesic effect from epidurally administered morphine. 2-Chloroprocaine, even when administered in small doses remote to the time of morphine injection, interferes with the duration of epidural morphine analgesia. 
Preclinical detection of motor and nonmotor manifestations. The advent of possible protective therapies for Parkinson's disease has created a need for methods of diagnosing the disease before the clinical features become fully evident. As a number of motor and nonmotor manifestations of the disease emerge months to years before a diagnosis can be made, a battery of clinical tests might be sufficient to identify individuals at an earlier stage than is currently possible using the standard history and physical examination. A list of questions regarding possible risk factors, specific symptoms, and observations of family members could be combined in a self-administered questionnaire that might identify individuals with a high probability of early, but otherwise undiagnosable, Parkinson's disease. Identification of subtle motor features is another possible screening method. For example, handwriting and speech are commonly affected prior to diagnosis; thus, automated analysis of these motor actions might also provide detection of incipient disease. 
Dose response of fish oil versus safflower oil on graft arteriosclerosis in rabbit heterotopic cardiac allografts. With the advent of cyclosporin A, accelerated coronary arteriosclerosis has become the major impediment to the long-term survival of heart transplant recipients. Due to epidemiologic reports suggesting a salutary effect of fish oil, the dose response of fish oil on graft coronary arteriosclerosis in a rabbit heterotopic cardiac allograft model was assessed using safflower oil as a caloric control. Seven groups of New Zealand White rabbits (n = 10/group) received heterotropic heart transplants from Dutch-Belted donors and were immunosuppressed with low-dose cyclosporin A (7.5 mg/kg/day). Group 1 animals were fed a normal diet and served as control. Group 2, 3, and 4 animals received a daily supplement of low- (0.25 mL/kg/day), medium- (0.75 mL/kg/day), and high- (1.5 mL/kg/day) dose fish oil (116 mg n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid/mL), respectively. Group 5, 6, and 7 animals were supplemented with equivalent dose of safflower oil (i.e., 0.25, 0.75, and 1.5 mL/kg/day). Oil-supplemented rabbits were pretreated for 3 weeks before transplantation and maintained on the same diet for 6 weeks after operation. The extent of graft coronary arteriosclerosis was quantified using computer-assisted, morphometric planimetry. When the animals were killed, cyclosporin A was associated with elevated plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the control group. While safflower oil prevented the increase in plasma lipids at all dosages, fish oil ameliorated the cyclosporin-induced increase in total cholesterol only with high doses. Compared to control animals, there was a trend for more graft vessel disease with increasing fish oil dose, as assessed by mean luminal occlusion and intimal thickness. A steeper trend was observed for increasing doses of safflower oil; compared to the high-dose safflower oil group, animals supplemented with low-dose safflower oil had less mean luminal occlusion (16.3% +/- 5.9% versus 41.4% +/- 7.6%, p less than 0.017) and intimal thickness (7.9 +/- 1.9 microns versus 34.0 +/- 13.0 microns, analysis of variance: p = 0.054). Low-dose safflower oil also had a slight, but nonsignificant, beneficial effect on graft vessel disease when compared to control rabbits. The same trends were observed in the degree of histologic rejection (0 = none to 3 = severe) in fish oil- and safflower oil-treated animals. Rejection score correlated weakly but significantly (p = 0.0001) with mean luminal occlusion (r = 0.52) and intimal thickness (r = 0.46). Therefore allograft coronary disease in this model appeared to exhibit an unfavorable, direct-dose response to fish oil and safflower oil, independent of effects on plasma lipids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Bacteriology of the anal wound after open hemorrhoidectomy. Qualitative and quantitative analysis. The purpose of this study is to analyze the size of the bacterial colonies in anal wounds after open hemorrhoidectomy. Twenty patients were studied during predetermined postoperative time periods. Material was collected from the surface and from within the tissue of each patient's three open wounds, intraoperatively, on the 6th, 13th and 20th postoperative days for bacteriologic examination in aerobic, microaerophilic, and anaerobic media. The bacterium most commonly identified was Escherichia coli, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Proteus mirabilis were also identified. Critical indexes of colonization were present since the intraoperative stage (greater than 10(5) bacteria/g of tissue and greater than 10(6) bacteria/ml); obligate anaerobic bacteria were not identified; neither the species nor the number of bacteria, even when critical indexes were present, prevented proper healing. The same bacteria were not necessarily present on the surface and in the tissue; the bacterial load observed among the three wounds (left lateral, right posterior, and right anterior), was the same. 
Elevated plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) with adrenal hyperplasia: a new factor in ACTH regulation? We report a patient with Cushing's syndrome in whom the etiology of the hypercortisolemia could not be definitely established despite extensive biochemical investigations. Results included raised basal serum cortisol, plasma ACTH, and urinary free cortisol; failure to suppress even a paradoxical rise in serum cortisol after dexamethasone (1 mg overnight, 2, 8, and 16 mg/day); and a definite but not exaggerated rise in 11-deoxycortisol after metyrapone. After iv CRF, plasma ACTH rose from 22 to 30 pmol/L. Abdominal computed tomographic scanning showed adrenal hyperplasia; the presence of an adrenal adenoma, although suspected, was not established. An unusual finding was the presence in the urine of large amounts of 21-deoxycortisol metabolites, including 3 alpha,11 beta,17 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one and 5 beta-pregnane 3 alpha,11 beta,17 alpha,20 alpha-tetrol. On the basis of preoperative biochemical/radiological findings, a provisional diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome associated with autonomous bilateral adrenal hyperplasia was made. Incomplete bilateral adrenalectomy was performed; adrenal hyperplasia was histologically confirmed, but no tumor was found. However, ACTH was measured 1) just before operation when the patient was receiving treatment with metyrapone, and 2) postoperatively when the patient was receiving steroid replacement only, and on these occasions ACTH levels were lower than during the initial investigations. Pituitary scans before and after adrenalectomy were similar, offering no evidence of pituitary infarction. We propose that abnormal production of 21-deoxycortisol contributed to the aberrant regulation of ACTH and cortisol in this case, providing an example of a previously unreported cause of hypercortisolemia. 
Microangiopathy of the brain, retina, and ear: improvement without immunosuppressive therapy. We describe a pregnant young woman with branch retinal arteriolar occlusions, encephalopathy, and hearing loss in whom we demonstrated a patent foramen ovale. She improved while receiving anticoagulants and no immunosuppressive therapy. The microangiopathic syndrome of retinopathy, encephalopathy, and deafness may be due to a disturbance of coagulation and/or microembolism. 
The spectrum of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Report of six pediatric cases and review of the literature. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology characterized by infiltration of the gastrointestinal tract with eosinophilic leukocytes, accompanied by varying abdominal symptoms and usually by peripheral blood eosinophilia. We report our experience with six pediatric cases presenting to the Cleveland Clinic Foundation over the past eight years. Unusual findings in our patients included ascitic fluid without eosinophilia and eosinophilic pericarditis (one patient), and eosinophilic cholecystitis (one patient). Endoscopic examination and biopsy helped to establish the diagnosis in all patients. Bone marrow aspiration supported the diagnosis by demonstrating eosinophilia and identifying reactivation of the disease, even in cases without peripheral eosinophilia. All six patients responded promptly to prednisone. Diagnosis is challenging and eosinophilic gastroenteritis may be more common than is recognized. This series of cases significantly expands the spectrum of the disease in children, and documents the usefulness of diagnostic endoscopy in this condition. 
Electroencephalogram patterns during sleep reflux in infants. Twenty-four infants, 3-35 months of age, with histories of apnea or chronic lung disease underwent nighttime polysomnography and esophageal pH monitoring. Fifteen infants had pathological levels of gastroesophageal reflux on esophageal pH monitoring, and 9 had normal study results (symptomatic controls). Partition of sleep stages, sleep efficiency, and frequency of arousals to electroencephalographic stage 0 were the same in both groups. During sleeping reflux episodes, defined as reflux starting during sleep stages 1-5 or reflux episodes consisting of greater than 50% of sleep stages 1-5, there was a 50% decrease in the amount of stage 0 electroencephalogram pattern compared with nonreflux sleep, and a compensatory increase in the non-rapid eye movement sleep stages. Reflux onsets in patients with pathological reflux were evenly divided between stages 0, 1/2, and 5. Onset of reflux occurred rarely during sleep stages 3 and 4. Slight body movement accompanied the onset of 62.5% of sleep reflux episodes in symptomatic controls and 64.7% in patients with pathological gastroesophageal reflux. Arousals to stage 0 electroencephalogram occurred with equal frequency in sleep reflux episodes of symptomatic controls and patients, and frequency did not increase over the observed value for nonreflux time. There were no differences between the sleep patterns of infants with and without pathological gastroesophageal reflux; nor were there decreases in arousals from sleep in infants with pathological reflux. However, reflux occurring during sleep in all infants studied was characterized by a significant decrease in stage 0 (waking) electroencephalogram. 
Successful angioplasty of a chronically occluded saphenous vein graft using a prolonged urokinase infusion from the brachial route. A 68-year-old man who presented with unstable angina had had cardiac bypass surgery 12 years earlier and successful angioplasty of a native circumflex lesion 18 months previously. Repeat catheterization showed a widely patent angioplasty site but interval closure of a saphenous vein graft to a large marginal branch that was totally occluded proximally. A stress test revealed significant myocardial ischemia. Severe peripheral peripheral vascular disease with known bilateral iliac artery occlusions mandated a brachial approach. Because of his high risk for repeat cardiac surgery, it was elected to attempt saphenous graft angioplasty following a prolonged urokinase infusion. After an infusion of urokinase for 36 hr, antegrade flow was restored and angioplasty was carried out successfully on a discrete mid-graft legion. Subsequent stress testing showed resolution of the ischemia. There were no vascular complications. 
Dipyridamole-induced decrement of functional recovery of postischemic reperfused myocardium in conscious dogs with well-developed coronary collateral circulation. The effects of dipyridamole (20 and 40 micrograms/kg/min intravenously) on the time course of functional recovery of myocardium after five 5-minute coronary artery occlusions and four 5-minute reperfusions and a subsequent 5-hour reperfusion period were studied in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs with well-developed coronary collateral circulation. In comparison with vehicle-treated control dogs, those given dipyridamole (20 and 40 micrograms/kg/min, respectively) 15 minutes before and during coronary occlusion had a greater depression of regional segment shortening (38 +/- 7% and 19 +/- 4%, respectively, vs control levels of 69 +/- 10% of preocclusion values) during acute coronary artery occlusion. After a 5-hour reperfusion period, segment shortening returned to preocclusion values in the control group but remained decreased in the dipyridamole groups (87 +/- 4% and 75%, respectively). These results suggest that dipyridamole in a dose-dependent manner exacerbates recovery of contractility of postischemic reperfused myocardium in dogs with well-developed coronary collateral circulation. 
Dexmedetomidine prevents epinephrine-induced arrhythmias through stimulation of central alpha 2 adrenoceptors in halothane-anesthetized dogs. Since alpha 2-adrenergic agonists have important effects on the adrenergic system that have recently been applied to the anesthetic setting, we investigated the effect of stimulation of alpha 2 adrenoceptors on epinephrine-induced arrhythmias in halothane-anesthetized dogs. The arrhythmogenic threshold for epinephrine was determined during halothane anesthesia in the presence of dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha 2 agonist, and L-medetomidine, a stereoisomer of medetomidine that lacks alpha 2-agonist activity. Dexmedetomidine increased the arrhythmogenic threshold for epinephrine in a dose-dependent manner during halothane anesthesia. At the highest dose of dexmedetomidine, 0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1, there was a three-fold increase in both the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine and the plasma epinephrine concentration that was reached at this dose. On the other hand, L-medetomidine over the same dose range did not effect the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine. Atipamezole, a central alpha 2 antagonist that crossed the blood-brain barrier, blocked the antiarrhythmic action of dexmedetomidine. L-659,066 a peripheral alpha 2 antagonist that does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, did not affect the antiarrhythmic action of dexmedetomidine. Thus, dexmedetomidine's antiarrhythmic effect on epinephrine-induced arrhythmias during halothane anesthesia appears to be mediated at least in part by stimulation of central alpha 2 adrenoceptors. 
Status of the valves in the superficial and deep venous system in chronic venous disease. The relationship between the functional status of the venous valves in the superficial and deep veins and ulceration was evaluated in 42 patients. Twenty-five patients had ulcers, 12 of these patients had a history of previous deep venous thrombosis and 13 of these patients denied such an event. Seventeen patients had normal ankle skin, 10 of these patients had a documented history of deep vein thrombosis and seven of these patients had varicose veins only. An ultrasonic duplex scanner was used to document the presence of reflux in all segments of the superficial and deep system. In the entire group of 25 limbs with ulceration, valvular incompetence was noted in 22 limbs at levels involving segments that communicated with the ulcer-bearing area. Of the 17 limbs with normal ankle skin, in only two instances was a single segment of posterior tibial vein in midcalf found to be incompetent. For those patients with normal ankle skin and a history of varicose veins, the deep veins below the common femoral vein level were always competent. 
CHLVPP chemotherapy with involved-field irradiation for Hodgkin's disease: favorable results with acceptable toxicity. Patients with Hodgkin's disease who were previously untreated with chemotherapy received the chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone (CHLVPP) regimen plus limited involved-field radiation therapy for treatment of Hodgkin's disease through the Nebraska Lymphoma Study Group. One hundred patients, 87 with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease and 13 who relapsed after receiving previous radiation therapy, were treated with this regimen between 1982 and 1989. Complete remissions (CRs) were obtained in 88 of 100 patients (88%), and there have been a total of eight relapses. The overall 3-year failure-free survival was 76%, with good-prognosis patients (ie, Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 80) having a 3-year failure-free survival of 87%. Toxicity with this regimen was minimal, with neutropenic fevers reported in 13% of the patient population, moderate alopecia in 5%, and mild to moderate nausea and vomiting in 11% of the patients. As primary induction therapy for Hodgkin's disease, CHLVPP is an effective regimen with a high patient acceptance profile. 
Bypass grafting to the popliteal artery in limbs with occluded crural arteries. Intraoperative completion angiograms of 47 femoropopliteal bypasses in limbs with occluded crural arteries were reviewed to identify the angiographic determinants of early outcome. Of 28 limbs in which the foot vessels were available for analysis, only 2 (7%) had an intact pedal circulation, and 18 limbs demonstrated no crural arteries suitable for distal reconstruction. The overall cumulative patency rate was 51% with a 76% limb salvage rate at 12 months. All seven grafts performed onto a popliteal artery segment of less than 8 cm occluded in the early period. The status of crural and foot arteries and the number of collaterals did not correlate well with early patency. Limbs with no patent crural artery that were analyzed in the poor angiographic runoff group, according to our previously reported classification, demonstrated relatively higher patency rates than the other subgroups with poor runoff. In cases where angiography demonstrates a poor runoff for distal revascularization, popliteal bypass with occluded crural arteries might achieve acceptable patency rates. 
Long-term survival and toxicity in small cell lung cancer. Expanded Southwest Oncology Group experience. The Southwest Oncology Group formed a database of 2,501 patients consecutively enrolled in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) trials since 1976. This report summarizes an analysis of this database to determine predictors of 2- and 5-year survival in limited stage disease (LD) and 1- and 2-year survival in extensive stage disease (ED). In addition, we analyzed the frequency of late recurrences, toxicity, and quality of life issues in the long-term survivors. For consecutive studies, greater than or equal to 2-year survival in LD were 15 percent, 21 percent, 28 percent, and 43 percent; 5-year survivals were 5 percent, 9 percent, 8 percent, and 20 percent. In ED, greater than or equal to 1-year survivals were 27 percent, 23 percent, 21 percent, and 42 percent; greater than or equal to 2-year survivals were 6 percent, 5 percent, 3 percent, and 19 percent. Using the logistic regression multivariate model, independent favorable predictors of 5-year survival for patients accrued to our older LD trials were normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) values and good performance status. Therapy as employed in these trials was not an independent factor. However, if patients enrolled on more recent trials were included, 2-year predictors could be assessed. Therapy with concurrent chemoradiotherapy and female gender then became additional independent favorable predictors. In ED, a single metastatic site and a normal LHH value were favorable predictors of survival beyond 1 year. The retrospective review of 63 patients with LD who survived at least 5 years found 33 asymptomatic patients with no recurrent disease; 6 with recurrent SCLC, 3 of whom died; 7 who died of non-cancer-related causes or unknown causes; 3 who died of secondary primary lung cancer; and 14 alive with persistent central nervous system symptoms and signs, possibly due to prophylactic brain radiation as given in the first 3 trials. No increased incidence of this syndrome has yet been observed in subsequent trials. For ED patients, 25 of 51 survivors greater than or equal to 2 years subsequently died of recurrent SCLC. The majority of the long-term survivors with ED (35 of 51) had either a single metastatic site or metastases limited to opposite side of the chest or regional nodes. Our multivariate models support the conclusion that aggressive combined modality, concurrent induction therapy, along with favorable prognostic variables, independently contribute to the improved long-term survival we have observed in LD. Longer follow-up is required to confirm that this improvement has occurred with less late toxicity. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: results of an early experience. Ninety consecutive patients over a 6-month period with acute (31 patients) or chronic (59 patients) cholecystitis underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on an ambulatory (49 patients), one-night (33 patients), or two-night (5 patients) basis. Three patients required open procedures for 1) perforated duodenal ulcer at 48 h, postoperatively, 2) a cholecystoduodenal fistula, and 3) Mirizzis syndrome with erosion of the common duct. The procedure is safe, efficacious, and should be offered to patients with acute and chronic biliary disease. 
Altered cutaneous sensation in trigeminal neuralgia. Noninvasive quantitative somatosensory tests were used to measure sensory perception thresholds on the faces of 26 patients with idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. The affected divisions were determined by the presence of trigger zones. Elevations of thresholds of sensations subserved by both large- and small-diameter fibers were found both in the affected and in the unaffected adjacent divisions when compared with the healthy side. The findings are interpreted as further evidence of combined peripheral and central pathologic conditions in idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia. 
Noninvasive imaging in acute coronary disease. A clinical perspective. Numerous highly complex and sensitive noninvasive imaging techniques have enhanced the care of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Optimum use requires specific objectives to be defined in advance, including a review of the potential impact of the test on subsequent decisions. An additional issue that is subject to scrutiny in the current climate of cost containment relates to the incremental value of a specific examination. The imaging modality to be used will partially depend on other issues, including accessibility, cost, and interindividual or institutional expertise with a particular technique. Major applications in noninvasive imaging in the acute coronary syndromes include the following: 1) diagnosis, including identification of associated diseases and contraindications for acute reperfusion; 2) evaluation and management of complications (mechanical and nonmechanical); 3) determination of prognosis (both early and late); 4) estimation of myocardial viability; 5) assessment of therapeutic efficacy; 6) investigational approaches, including 99mTc-sestamibi tomographic imaging, ultrafast cine computed tomographic scanning, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. Previous studies in the prethrombolytic era have documented the powerful impact of radionuclide stress testing on prognosis, but this needs to be reevaluated in the light of the changing current population undergoing stress testing. Preliminary data imply that the prognostic accuracy of stress testing after thrombolytic therapy is diminished. Moreover, the role of the open infarct-related artery in traditional estimates of prognosis (e.g., ejection fraction) requires further study. Noninvasive imaging has multiple applications in the diagnosis and management of patients with acute coronary disease, but the decision to use a specific technology in a particular circumstance mandates good clinical judgment and selectivity. 
Treatment of acute cluster headache with sumatriptan. The Sumatriptan Cluster Headache Study Group BACKGROUND. Attacks of cluster headache are difficult to treat. Sumatriptan, an agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine1-like receptors, has proved effective in the treatment of migraine. The clinical similarities between migraine and cluster headache and positive results from an open pilot study in patients with cluster headache indicated that sumatriptan should be evaluated more rigorously in the treatment of this condition. METHODS. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study to assess the efficacy and tolerability of sumatriptan in 49 patients with cluster headache. The patients received, in random order, a subcutaneous injection of 6 mg of sumatriptan for one cluster-headache attack and placebo for another attack. The results for the two attacks could be fully evaluated for 39 patients. A response to treatment was defined as complete or almost complete relief of headache (no pain or mild pain) within 15 minutes after the injection. RESULTS. In the 39 patients, the severity of headache decreased in 74 percent of the attacks within 15 minutes of treatment with sumatriptan, as compared with 26 percent of the attacks for which placebo was given (P less than 0.001). Thirty-six percent of the patients were free of pain within 10 minutes after the administration of sumatriptan, as compared with 3 percent after placebo (P less than 0.001); by 15 minutes these numbers had increased to 46 percent and 10 percent, respectively (P less than 0.001). Thirteen percent of the patients required oxygen as an additional treatment 15 minutes after receiving sumatriptan, as compared with 49 percent of those who received placebo. The severity of functional disability and the incidence of ipsilateral conjunctival injection also decreased more in response to sumatriptan than placebo. Sumatriptan was well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS. Sumatriptan is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for acute attacks of cluster headache. 
Importance of the aminoglycoside dosing regimen in the penicillin-netilmicin combination for treatment of Enterococcus faecalis-induced experimental endocarditis. The penicillin-aminoglycoside combination is recommended for the treatment of systemic enterococcal infections. However, the optimal dosing regimen of the aminoglycoside remains to be elucidated. We evaluated the efficacy of penicillin, alone or in combination with various dosing regimens of netilmicin, for the treatment of experimental left-sided Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis in rabbits. Animals were injected intramuscularly for 4 days with penicillin alone or in combination with netilmicin in one of the following regimens: netilmicin at a low dose (2 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h), netilmicin at a high dose (4 mg/kg every 8 h), or netilmicin at a single daily high dose (12 mg/kg every 24 h). MICs and MBCs were 3.1 and 6.2 micrograms/ml and 8 and 8 micrograms/ml for penicillin and netilmicin, respectively. A netilmicin concentration of 4 micrograms/ml was the lowest concentration that achieved synergism with penicillin, as shown by the kill-curve method. Mean peak levels of netilmicin in serum were 5.6 (netilmicin at 2 mg/kg), 9.8 (netilmicin at 4 mg/kg), and 20.6 (netilmicin at 12 mg/kg) micrograms/ml. Mean penicillin levels in serum were constantly above the MIC. Penicillin plus netilmicin at a high dose given three times daily was more effective (P less than 0.05) than any other regimen in reducing bacterial titers in vegetations and was the only treatment that induced a significant bactericidal activity in rabbit serum during the trough. We concluded that divided doses of aminoglycoside are more effective than the same total dose given once daily in combination with penicillin. 
Truncated forms of DNA-binding estrogen receptors in human breast cancer. The likelihood a breast cancer will respond to antiestrogen therapy depends on the tumor content of immunoreactive or ligand-binding estrogen receptor (ER). To investigate the failure of many ER-positive breast cancers to respond to antiestrogen therapy, we examined by gel-shift assay the ability of tumor ER to bind its cognate estrogen response element (ERE). Analysis of 38 primary breast cancers showed that some tumors containing abundant immunoreactive ER failed to demonstrate DNA binding ER. In many other ER-positive tumors, the fraction of DNA binding ER was low and consisted primarily of truncated receptor forms, which on Western analysis were revealed to be 50 kD homodimers and 67-50 kD ER heterodimers. The use of protease inhibitors during tumor extraction and the demonstration of nuclear-localizing ER and ERE-binding COUP (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter) protein in these tumors indicated that the truncated forms of ER were likely present in vivo. The presence of intact DNA binding ER correlated with higher tumor content of immunoreactive sex steroid receptors (ER and/or PR), standard predictors of tumor responsiveness to antiestrogen, suggesting that loss or truncation of DNA binding ER may be an important prognostic parameter accounting for some forms of clinical resistance to antiestrogen therapy. 
Frequency of late reversibility in stress-redistribution thallium-201 SPECT using an early reinjection protocol. To assess the efficacy of an early thallium-201 reinjection protocol for reducing the need for late redistribution imaging, the frequency of thallium-201 late reversibility was prospectively assessed in 62 patients who had stress-redistribution thallium-201 studies by single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), and who received 1 mCi of thallium-201 reinjection immediately following stress tomographic acquisition. These patients also demonstrated greater than or equal to 2 segments with nonreversible defects at 4-hour imaging and underwent late (18-to 72-hour) redistribution imaging. When the criterion of late reversibility was defined as greater than or equal to 1 segment with a 4-hour nonreversible defect demonstrating late reversibility, late reversibility was present in 36 (58%) of the 62 patients and in 88 (24%) of 368 SPECT segments. When the criterion of greater than or equal to 2 segments was used, late reversibility was found in 21 (34%) of the 62 patients and in 73 (20%) of the 368 segments. Of the 21 patients who had greater than or equal to 2 late reversible segments, 12 (57%) exhibited late reversibility in greater than or equal to 3 segments. The frequency of detected reversible defects increased from 32% by 4-hour imaging to 48% by combined 4-hour and late imaging (p less than 0.0001). The patients who demonstrated late reversibility could not be distinguished from those who had only late nonreversible defects by analysis of the clinical, exercise, and electrocardiographic (ECG) variables. 
Gaze-dependent hemianopia without hemispatial neglect. A hemispheric field is the space defined by the midsagittal plane of the body. Hemianopia, in the absence of hemispheric spatial neglect, has been thought to be purely retinotopic. Confrontation testing of visual fields in eccentric positions of gaze in hemianopic patients permits the discrimination of hemispheric from retinotopic deficits. In the primary position of gaze, a patient with an ischemic lesion of the right occipital and temporal lobes, who was without unilateral spatial neglect, was unable to detect finger movement, name objects, or identify shapes or colors in the left retinotopic hemifield, but when gazing 30 degrees to the right (so that the left retinotopic field was in the right hemispheric field), he performed nearly as well in the left retinotopic field as in the right. The mechanism of this gaze-dependent hemifield visual impairment is unknown, but we discuss four possibilities: (1) eccentric gaze enhances an alternative visual system; (2) the lesion led to modality-specific hemispheric inattention that was corrected by directing intention (plan to act) and gazing to the right; (3) the lesion led to modality specific inattention that was corrected by compensatory mechanisms that may normally enhance attentive vigilance in central space during eccentric gaze; and (4) the neuronal substrate for hemispheric vision was destroyed, whereas that for retinotopic vision was preserved. 
Cutaneous and subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma: a clinicopathological review of 14 cases with reference to antidesmin staining and nuclear DNA patterns studied by flow cytometry. Among 14 patients (11 female and three male) with cutaneous and subcutaneous leiomyosarcomas, metastatic spread occurred in six of the 13 patients with adequate follow-up. The tumours were classified with regard to tumour grade, number of mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields, reactivity to antidesmin antibodies, and DNA pattern as assessed by flow cytometry. Antidesmin antibody staining was present in only six cases and seemed to be less common in the higher-grade tumours. The DNA pattern was aneuploid in five cases and non-classifiable in one case; all of these cases had metastatic spread. None of the eight remaining diploid cases had metastatic spread. DNA content was a strong predictor of metastatic potential. 
Quantitative nuclear DNA content in fine needle aspirates of pancreatic cancer. The quantitative nuclear DNA content of nuclei from fine needle aspirations from 70 patients with pancreatic cancer was measured using an image analyser system. Retrospective analysis of patients indicated that cases with tumour stemlines in the diploid region had the best chance for radical surgery (p less than 0.006) and the best probability of survival (p less than 0.0004). The prognosis for patients with tetraploid stemlines was intermediate and was poorest for patients with no stemlines in the diploid-tetraploid region. From those parameters assessed postoperatively, only the tumour stage added appreciable information on prognosis to the preoperative quantitative DNA content obtainable. Therefore, in patients with pancreatic cancer the quantitative DNA content should be taken into account in planning treatment and assessing prognosis. Furthermore, the quantitative DNA content may have a major role in stratification for further treatment trials. 
Role of lymphangiography in staging testicular seminoma. Bipedal lymphangiography (LAG) and abdominal/pelvic computerized tomography (CT) are both useful in evaluating retroperitoneal lymph nodes in early-stage testicular seminoma. Fifty-four patients who had both radiologic studies performed between 1982 and 1986 were identified, and their films were reviewed. Four patients had evidence of retroperitoneal lymph node metastases on both CT and LAG. Of the 50 patients who had normal findings on CT scan, 39 (78%) had a normal LAG and 11 (22%) had a positive LAG. All 11 patients had architectural abnormalities within normal-sized nodes. No patient had positive findings on CT with negative LAG. In addition to aiding in staging, LAG is very useful in designing radiation treatment portals. Therefore, we believe that LAG can continue to play an important role in the accurate staging and treatment of patients with testicular seminoma. 
Spontaneous in vitro secretion of antibody to cytomegalovirus (CMV) by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells: a new approach to studying the CMV-immune system interaction. The in vitro secretion of cytomegalovirus (CMV)-specific antibodies by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was analyzed in patients with acute CMV infection and CMV-seropositive patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. This active and spontaneous in vitro secretion was not affected by the depletion of T cells or adherent cells. The number of anti-CMV antibody-secreting cells was estimated to be 28-176/10(6) PBMC; 30%-65% of the total in vitro antibody production was CMV-specific. This secretion seemed to be independent of in vitro polyclonal B cell activation, in vitro antigen-specific lymphocyte stimulation, or in vivo Epstein-Barr virus-induced B cell transformation. In vitro anti-CMV antibody production may therefore result from an in vivo stimulation of the immune system by CMV antigens and might indicate CMV replication in the host. 
Lack of effect of PN 200-110 on neuronal injury and neurological outcome in middle cerebral artery-occluded rats. We evaluated the influence of a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.24 mg/kg PN 200-110 started 20 minutes before the induction of ischemia and continued for 2 hours on infarct size, histopathology, and neurological outcome in middle cerebral artery-occluded rats treated with PN 200-110 (n = 8), placebo (n = 7), or saline (n = 8). Neurological examination was performed 24 hours after occlusion. We quantified infarct size by 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride, hematoxylin and eosin, and Nissl staining and by computerized analysis of tracings of the infarcted areas and evaluated neuronal injury at the infarct periphery. The different types of ischemic cell damage were quantified by direct visual counting. We found no differences among saline-, placebo-, and PN 200-110-treated rats regarding infarct size, amount of neuronal alteration, and neurological outcome. Our results indicate the lack of a significant protective effect of this drug in experimental focal ischemia. 
Cardiac toxicity 4 to 20 years after completing anthracycline therapy. OBJECTIVE.--To assess the cardiac status of long-term survivors of pediatric malignancies who received chemotherapy, including anthracyclines. DESIGN AND METHOD.-Patients were evaluated by echocardiogram from 4 to 20 years (median, 7 years) after completion of anthracyclines, with prospective and retrospective analysis. PATIENTS.--The consecutive sample of 201 patients had received a total anthracycline dose of 200 to 1275 mg/m2 (median, 450 mg/m2), and 51 patients had mediastinal radiotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--The overall incidence and severity of abnormal systolic cardiac function were determined for the entire cohort. Risk factors of total anthracycline dose, mediastinal radiotherapy, age during treatment, and length of follow-up were examined. RESULTS.--Twenty-three percent (47/201) of the cohort had abnormal cardiac function on noninvasive testing at long-term follow-up. Correlation between total cumulative dose, length of follow-up, and mediastinal irradiation with incidence of abnormalities was significant. Fifty-six patients were followed up for 10 years or more (median, 12 years), with a median anthracycline dose of 495 mg/m2. Thirty-eight percent (21/56) of these patients, compared with 18% (26/145) of patients evaluated after less than 10 years, had abnormal findings. Sixty-three percent of patients followed up for 10 years or more after receiving 500 mg/m2 or more of anthracyclines had abnormal findings. Nine of 201 patients had late symptoms, including cardiac failure and dysrhythmia, and three patients died suddenly. Microscopic examination of the myocardium on biopsy and autopsy revealed fibrosis. CONCLUSION.--The 23% incidence of late cardiac abnormalities warrants continued evaluation of patients after anthracyclines to guide patient care and the design of future chemotherapeutic protocols. 
Subcutaneous sarcoma. A population-based study of 129 patients. We reviewed 129 patients with subcutaneous sarcoma diagnosed from 1964 to the end of 1985 in a population-based series of sarcoma cases from southern Sweden. The annual incidence was 0.4 per 100,000, comprising 32% of all soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities or the trunk wall. Compared to deep-seated sarcomas, subcutaneous tumours were half the size at diagnosis, more common in the lower leg and foot, more often malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and of a lower grade of malignancy. None of the low-grade and only 7% of the high-grade tumours recurred locally after wide local excision without radiotherapy. The cumulative five-year survival for all 129 patients was 80%. Multivariate analysis identified only high grade of malignancy and the size of the tumour (greater than 5 cm) as independent prognostic factors. We conclude that systemic or local adjuvant therapy is not generally indicated for subcutaneous sarcoma because of the good prognosis and low local recurrence rate after wide excision. 
Decline in ischaemic heart disease in Iceland and change in risk factor levels. OBJECTIVE--To monitor trends in mortality and morbidity due to ischaemic heart disease and compare these with observed levels of risk factors from population surveys. DESIGN--Analysis of trends in death rates from ischaemic heart disease in Iceland compared with expected rates computed from population surveys. Risk factor levels together with beta factors obtained from Cox's regression analysis were used to compute expected death rates. Trends in morbidity due to acute myocardial infarction were assessed and secular trends in dietary consumption compared with trends in cholesterol concentrations. SETTING--Reykjavik, Iceland (total population 250,000; over half the population live in Reykjavik). SUBJECTS--12,814 randomly selected residents in the Reykjavik area aged 45-64 (6623 men, 6191 women; 72% and 80% of those invited). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Age adjusted rates of myocardial infarction and deaths from ischaemic heart disease. Expected risk from risk factor levels (smoking, total serum cholesterol concentration, systolic blood pressure) at each unique survey visit. RESULTS--Mortality from ischaemic heart disease has decreased by 17-18% since 1970. During 1981-6 the myocardial infarction attack rate in men under 75 decreased by 23%. A decrease occurred in the level of all three major risk factors after 1968. The fall in the serum cholesterol concentration coincided with a reduction in consumption of dairy fat and margarine. The calculated reduction in risk for the age group 45-64 was about 35%, which was closely similar to the observed decrease in mortality due to ischaemic heart disease in that age group. CONCLUSION--The reduction in mortality from ischaemic heart disease was substantially due to a decreased incidence of myocardial infarction and could be attributed largely to the reduction in risk factors. 
Steel-Dickie mutation encodes a c-kit ligand lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Mice homozygous for the viable Sl allele steel-Dickie (Sld) are sterile, severely anemic, and black-eyed white. The nature of the Sld mutation was investigated at the molecular level and was found to be due to a 4.0-kilobase intragenic deletion in mast cell growth factor (MGF) genomic sequences, providing conclusive evidence that Sl encodes MGF. As a consequence of this deletion, Sld is only capable of encoding a soluble truncated growth factor that lacks both transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Northern analysis indicates that Sld mRNA is expressed at approximately wild-type levels in adult tissues, and yeast expression studies suggest that the Sld protein is as biologically active as wild-type soluble MGF. These studies provide a molecular basis for explaining the Sld phenotype, a description of a germ-line mutation in the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of a membrane-bound growth factor, and in vivo evidence for the importance of membrane-bound forms of growth factors in mammalian development. 
Round atelectasis in a 20-year-old woman. Round atelectasis is an unusual pulmonary pseudotumor often associated with primary pleural pathologic conditions or pleural effusion. We report the case of a 20-year-old woman who was found to have a large, circular pulmonary lesion demonstrated on both plain chest x-ray film and computed chest tomography. The patient underwent exploratory thoracotomy, at which time this uncommon entity was identified. 
A phase I trial of taxol given by a 6-hour intravenous infusion. Taxol is a unique mitotic inhibitor that has entered phase II investigation. Phase I studies demonstrated hypersensitivity reactions that were related to the cremophor vehicle and to the rate of drug infusion. As a result, the time span of intravenous (IV) infusion of taxol was routinely prolonged to 6 hours or beyond, and premedication with diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, and cimetidine was initiated. Early studies showed antitumor activity, especially against malignant melanoma and ovarian carcinoma. This phase I trial was performed giving taxol, as a 6-hour IV infusion every 21 days, without premedication. The purpose was to study the necessity of premedication and its impact on toxicity and pharmacokinetics. Thirty-one patients received 64 assessable courses of taxol. One patient had a hypersensitivity reaction, which was easily controlled using routine measures. Myelosuppression was dose-limiting, but sporadic, with two fatalities due to sepsis. Nonhematologic toxicity was of grade 1 and 2 except for one patient with grade 3 mucositis and two patients with grade 3 neuropathy. The neuropathy consisted of reversible painful paresthesias, requiring discontinuation of drug in two patients. Four partial responses were seen (three in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, one in a patient with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary). Pharmacokinetic values were consistent with those previously reported. The occurrence of myelosuppression or neurotoxicity appeared to be associated with the area under the concentration x time curve (AUC) of taxol. The recommended phase II starting dose on this schedule is 225 mg/m2. Taxol merits broad investigation at the phase II level. 
HLA association with dermatitis herpetiformis is accounted for by a cis or transassociated DQ heterodimer. HLA-DR, DQ, and DP restriction fragment genotyping was undertaken in 23 dermatitis herpetiformis patients and 53 healthy control subjects. HLA-DQw2 was present in 100% of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (23 of 23) versus 40% of control subjects (21 of 53). Significant secondary associations occurred with HLA-DR3 (91% of patients versus 28% of control subjects) and DPw1 (39% of patients versus 11% of control subjects). Dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease thus share an identical HLA class II association. It is likely that HLA class II genes directly influence the immune responses leading to mucosal damage in both diseases. The strongest candidate for disease susceptibility to dermatitis herpetiformis is DQw2. The HLA molecule most likely to be involved in coeliac disease is a specific DQ alpha/DQ beta heterodimer, encoded in cis arrangement in DR3 haplotypes or in trans arrangement in a DR5, 7 genotype. Our data on dermatitis herpetiformis patients fits this model perfectly. All these patients are capable of expressing this molecule, which may be responsible for the gluten sensitive enteropathy seen in a subgroup of patients with dermatitis herpetiformis and coeliac disease. 
Malignant tumours in patients with a history of multiple laryngeal papillomas: the significance of irradiation. For a period of more than 30 years irradiation was used in the treatment of multiple laryngeal papillomas, especially in children. The treatment was discontinued because a number of irradiated patients developed laryngeal carcinomas. There are however a number of reports of laryngeal and even bronchial carcinomas arising in patients with laryngeal papillomas who had not been irradiated. In addition, HPV type 11 has recently been found in laryngeal papillomas as well as in laryngeal and bronchial carcinomas, subsequently arising in the same patients, both irradiated and non-irradiated. The analysis of a series of 113 patients with laryngeal papillomas has shown that irradiated patients have a 16-fold increased risk of a subsequent carcinoma in the respiratory system. 
Influence of perfusate pH on the postischemic recovery of cardiac contractile function: involvement of sodium-hydrogen exchange. During reperfusion with pH 7.2 media after 55 min of ischemia, the recovery of developed tension (DT) and the maximal resting tension (RT) of the isolated right ventricular wall of rats were 58.8 +/- 6.5 and 201 +/- 20%, respectively, of the preischemic values. DT and RT in the ventricular wall perfused with pH 7.9 media for 6 min during reperfusion were 40 +/- 5.9 and 285 +/- 13%, respectively, of the preischemic values (P less than .05 vs. pH 7.2 group). The Na(+)-H+ exchange inhibitor, 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride (DMA), effectively antagonized the detrimental effect of pH 7.9 media. A pH 6.5 media inhibited DT recovery and the rise in RT in the first 6 min of reperfusion. Subsequent reperfusion with pH 7.2 media resulted in cardiac dysfunction similar to that observed when reperfused at pH 7.2 only. Cellular Na+ and Ca++ were significantly elevated after 6 min of reperfusion at pH 7.2. Na+ and Ca++ levels were increased further if reperfusion was carried out at pH 7.9. Inclusion of 20 microM DMA during reperfusion at 7.9 significantly reduced cellular Na+ and Ca++. Creatine phosphokinase activity in the coronary effluent rose significantly during reperfusion at pH 7.2 and this was exacerbated if the reperfusion pH was 7.9. DMA treatment during reperfusion could significantly inhibit this elevation. The data lend further support for an important role of Na(+)-H+ exchange in the development of ischemia-reperfusion injury. 
Postmenopausal estrogen therapy and cardiovascular disease. Ten-year follow-up from the nurses' health study BACKGROUND. The effect of postmenopausal estrogen therapy on the risk of cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Our 1985 report in the Journal, based on four years of follow-up, suggested that estrogen therapy reduced the risk of coronary heart disease, but a report published simultaneously from the Framingham Study suggested that the risk was increased. In addition, studies of the effect of estrogens on stroke have yielded conflicting results. METHODS. We followed 48,470 postmenopausal women, 30 to 63 years old, who were participants in the Nurses' Health Study, and who did not have a history of cancer or cardiovascular disease at base line. During up to 10 years of follow-up (337,854 person-years), we documented 224 strokes, 405 cases of major coronary disease (nonfatal myocardial infarctions or deaths from coronary causes), and 1263 deaths from all causes. RESULTS. After adjustment for age and other risk factors, the overall relative risk of major coronary disease in women currently taking estrogen was 0.56 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.40 to 0.80); the risk was significantly reduced among women with either natural or surgical menopause. We observed no effect of the duration of estrogen use independent of age. The findings were similar in analyses limited to women who had recently visited their physicians (relative risk, 0.45; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.66) and in a low-risk group that excluded women reporting current cigarette smoking, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or a Quetelet index above the 90th percentile (relative risk, 0.53; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.91). The relative risk for current and former users of estrogen as compared with those who had never used it was 0.89 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.78 to 1.00) for total mortality and 0.72 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.95) for mortality from cardiovascular disease. The relative risk of stroke when current users were compared with those who had never used estrogen was 0.97 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.45), with no marked differences according to type of stroke. CONCLUSIONS. Current estrogen use is associated with a reduction in the incidence of coronary heart disease as well as in mortality from cardiovascular disease, but it is not associated with any change in the risk of stroke. 
Treatment of 'vasomotor rhinitis' by the local application of silver nitrate. A series of 52 patients were closely assessed prospectively to determine the effectiveness, untoward effects and patient acceptance of a new method of treatment of 'vasomotor rhinitis' by silver nitrate application. The patient's age ranged from 11 to 50 years except one who was 58 years old. The report describes the technique used and results obtained following the painting of the 'trigger area' of the nasal mucosa in patients with 'vasomotor rhinitis'. Each patient was evaluated regularly and the evaluation was based on both subjective response and clinical examination. Only cases who had rhinorrhoea and sneezing as presenting symptoms were selected. Silver nitrate (20 per cent) was used after topical anaesthesia, and patients received four applications. Successful relief was obtained in 88.5 per cent (53.0 per cent good relief; 34.6 per cent acceptable relief), while 11.5 per cent of the cases (6 out of 52 cases) had poor relief. No complication was seen among the patients during treatment and follow-up and no silver poisoning was detected. 
Acetaminophen induced pancreatitis. This is the fourth reported case of acute pancreatitis associated with acetaminophen overdose. The patient had ingested the smallest amount of acetaminophen (9.75-13 g) that has been reported to produce acute pancreatitis. This patient also suffered liver and renal impairment and developed an ileus and ascites. Despite late therapy and laboratory tests that indicated a poor prognosis the patient made a complete recovery without sequelae. 
Effects of atrial natriuretic peptide on ischemic brain edema in rats evaluated by proton magnetic resonance method. We examined the effect of atrial natriuretic peptide on cerebral edema in 96 rats. Forty-four rats were given 30 (n = 11), 120 (n = 26), or 150 (n = 7) micrograms/kg of the peptide intravenously over 24 hours after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery to induce cerebral ischemia. We then measured the brain water content, the brain sodium and potassium contents, the in vitro proton nuclear magnetic resonance longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times, and the area of the edematous regions. Compared with saline treatment (n = 39), peptide treatment decreased the brain water content in a dose-dependent manner and decreased the brain sodium content significantly (p less than 0.05). Peptide treatment also suppressed the lengthening of both T1 and T2 in edematous tissue (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) and reduced the area of the edematous regions observed by magnetic resonance imaging (p less than 0.01). Atrial natriuretic peptide appears to have a pharmacological effect on ischemic brain edema, possibly by suppressing the elevation of water content through regulation of electrolyte transport in the brain. 
Infected intracranial aneurysm in an infant: case report. The case of a ruptured, infected intracranial aneurysm occurring in a 34-day-old child is reported. The child was brought for examination after a sudden onset of screaming and pallor, followed by focal seizures. Blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus, and a computed tomographic scan revealed a large hematoma in the region of the left sylvian fissure. An angiogram demonstrated a 17-mm aneurysm arising from a small branch of the middle cerebral artery. At craniotomy, the hematoma was evacuated and an infected aneurysm was removed. The etiology, pathogenesis, and management of infected intracranial aneurysms is discussed. Our patient is the youngest in whom such an aneurysm has yet been reported. 
Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema after transfusion with granulocyte antibody containing blood: treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. A 45-yr-old man developed severe non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema after a blood transfusion reaction which was resistant to standard therapy. We describe its successful treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 
An in-depth study of long-term users of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). Implications for clinical use of TENS. This in-depth study examines the relationships between patient, stimulator and outcome variables in a large number of chronic pain patients utilising TENS on a long-term basis. 179 patients completed a TENS questionnaire designed to record age, sex, cause and site of pain and TENS treatment regime. Of these 179 patients, 107 attended our research unit for assessment of the electrical characteristics of TENS during self-administered treatment. Although a remarkable lack of correlation between patient, stimulator and outcome variables was found to exist, the analysis revealed much information of importance: 47% of patients found TENS reduced their pain by more than half; TENS analgesia was rapid both in onset (less than 0.5 h in 75% patients) and in offset (less than 0.5 h in 51% patients); one-third of patients utilised TENS for over 61 h/week; pulse frequencies between 1 and 70 Hz were utilised by 75% of patients; 44% of patients benefitted from burst mode stimulation. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed. 
Symptom-limited exercise testing causes sustained diastolic dysfunction in patients with coronary disease and low effort tolerance. Exercise stress testing is routinely used for the noninvasive assessment of coronary artery disease and is considered a safe procedure. However, the provocation of severe ischemia might potentially cause delayed recovery of myocardial function. To investigate the possibility that maximal exercise testing could induce prolonged impairment of left ventricular function, 15 patients with angiographically proved coronary disease and 9 age-matched control subjects with atypical chest pain and normal coronary arteries were studied. Radionuclide ventriculography was performed at rest, at peak exercise, during recovery and 2 and 7 days after exercise. Ejection fraction, peak filling and peak emptying rates and left ventricular wall motion were analyzed. All control subjects had a normal exercise test at maximal work loads and improved left ventricular function on exercise. Patients developed 1 mm ST depression at 217 +/- 161 s at a work load of 70 +/- 30 W and a rate-pressure product of 18,530 +/- 4,465 mm Hg x beats/min. Although exercise was discontinued when angina or equivalent symptoms occurred, in all patients diagnostic ST depression (greater than or equal to 1 mm) developed much earlier than symptoms. Predictably, at peak exercise patients showed a decrease in ejection fraction and peak emptying and filling rates. Ejection fraction and peak emptying rate normalized within the recovery period, whereas peak filling rate remained depressed throughout recovery (p less than 0.002) and was still reduced 2 days after exercise (p less than 0.02). In conclusion, in patients with severe impairement of coronary flow reserve, maximal exercise may cause sustained impairement of diastolic function. 
Myoclonic spasms after epidural diamorphine infusion. A case is presented in which myoclonus occurred after epidural diamorphine infusion. Reports of this phenomenon following other epidural drugs and possible mechanisms are discussed. 
Treatment of a large odontogenic keratocyst using the Brosch procedure. The modified Brosch procedure has been described. It represents a reasonable alternative to resection or marsupialization when treating large OKC that occupy the molar, angle, and ramus regions of the mandible. Extraction of teeth affected by the lesion as well as generous removal of partially eroded bone and overlying soft tissues may contribute to lower recurrence rates. Cryosurgical or mechanical treatment of the bony cavity, which is well visualized using this technique, may also lead to improved long-term results. Treatment must be followed by continued, careful observation of the patient. 
Sticks and stones may break my bones ... reasoning about illness causality and body functioning in children who have a chronic illness. Children's concepts about illness causality and bodily functioning change in a predictable way with advancing age. Differences in the understanding of these concepts in healthy children vs children with a chronic illness have not been clearly delineated. This study included 49 children with a seizure disorder, 47 children with an orthopaedic condition, and 96 healthy children, all with normal intelligence and ranging in age from 5 to 16 years. It demonstrates systematic differences in children's general reasoning skills and in their understanding of concepts about illness causality and bodily functioning, as a function of their age and experience of illness. At all ages, children who had a condition with orthopaedic involvement reported less sophisticated general reasoning and concepts about illness than did healthy children; children with a seizure disorder reported similar general reasoning skills to those of healthy children, but considerably less sophisticated concepts about illness. Children's concepts about body functioning did not differ as a function of the presence of a chronic illness. When their different levels of general cognitive reasoning were statistically controlled, children with a chronic illness had somewhat more sophisticated concepts about bodily functioning than did healthy children. Differences in conceptual development among children with different types of illnesses lead to interesting speculations with regard to the effects of particular illness characteristics on children's cognitive development. 
Cytogenetic analysis of sperm from a man heterozygous for a pericentric inversion, inv (3) (p25q21). Human sperm chromosomes were studied in a man heterozygous for a pericentric inversion of chromosome 3(p25q21). The pronuclear chromosomes were analyzed after in vitro penetration of golden hamster eggs. A total of 144 sperm were examined: 69.2% were chromosomally balanced and 30.8% were recombinant. Of the balanced complements, the proportion with a normal chromosome 3 (37.6%) was approximately equal to the proportion with an inverted 3 (31.6%). Of the recombinant complements, the proportion of sperm with a duplication q/deletion p (17.3%) was approximately equal to the reciprocal event of duplication p/deletion q (13.5%). The recombinant chromosome 3 with a duplication q and deletion p has been observed in several abnormal children, but the duplication p/deletion q has never been reported. My results demonstrate that both recombinant chromosomes are produced as expected from an unequal number of crossovers within an inversion loop. In all likelihood the duplication p/deletion q chromosome is an early embryonic lethal because of the amount of genetic material deleted. The proportions of X-bearing (48.9%) and Y-bearing sperm (51.1%) were not significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio. There was no evidence for an interchromosomal effect. Of the three inversions studied by human sperm chromosome analysis, recombinant chromosomes have been observed only in this case. 
Incidence of cerebral hemorrhage after treatment with tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase following embolic stroke in rabbits [corrected] [published erratum appears in Stroke 1991 Feb;22(2):285] We studied thrombolysis in an animal model of embolic stroke to determine the safety of tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase. We occluded the middle cerebral arteries of 137 rabbits with radiolabeled blood clots and administered tissue plasminogen activator (n = 49), streptokinase (n = 40), or saline (n = 48) at various times after embolization. We assessed the rate of thrombolysis and cerebral hemorrhage 24 hours later. Both drugs were very effective in producing thrombolysis. Compared with saline, streptokinase caused a significant increase in the rate of cerebral hemorrhage (p less than 0.05), but tissue plasminogen activator did not. We conclude that thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke should be safer with tissue plasminogen activator than with streptokinase. 
Ultrastructural heterogeneity of epithelioid cells in cutaneous organized granulomas of diverse etiology In organized granulomatous inflammation, activated macrophages terminally differentiate into epithelioid cells (ECs). By light microscopy, individual ECs appear similar, irrespective of the inciting agent. Ultrastructural analysis of a number of clinical and experimental granulomas in man and mice reveals, however, three distinct varieties of these cells. They are classified as follows: (1) EC-I cells containing a mixture of lysosomal-dense bodies and phagolysosomes and arrays of rough endoplasmic reticulum in the cytoplasm; (2) EC-II cells showing primarily a secretory mode with prominent Golgi bodies and rich arrangement of dilated rough endoplasmic reticulum with no phagocytic vacuoles; and (3) EC-III cells containing large multisized vesicles crowded throughout the cytoplasm and presently of unknown function. Although the unique appearance of these cells offers little diagnostic help, the cells do distribute differentially in different granulomas. The EC-I cells tend to predominate in infectious granulomas and where an excess of foreign material and debris is present. The EC-II cells are most characteristic of active sarcoidal granulomas, and the EC-III cells appear in chronic, long-standing granulomas. The heterogeneic nature of these cells seems to suggest their functions in granulomatous inflammation are not always the same. 
The influence of intraoperative hypotension and perioperative blood transfusion on disease-free survival in patients with complete resection of colorectal liver metastases. An increased interest in surgical treatment of liver metastases from colorectal origin has evolved recently. However not all patients benefit from this approach, with early recurrence and death still being encountered. To evaluate clinical as well as perioperative factors that might significantly affect the outcome of patients with completely resected colorectal liver metastases, we examined 116 patients who underwent resection between September 1987 and August 1989. Median follow-up time was 13.2 months (0.6 to 31.4 months). The overall survival rate was 91% at 1 year and 75% at 2 years. Median survival was not reached. Median disease-free survival time was 11.5 months, with 49.4% and 21.2% of the patients being free of disease at 1 and 2 years, respectively. By univariate analysis, site of primary colorectal cancer, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, size of metastases, number of metastases, length of operation time, percentage mean arterial pressure, number of hypotensive episodes, duration of hypotensive episodes, and whole blood transfusion significantly affected recurrence rate following resection. However only site of primary tumor, CEA, number of metastases, and number of hypotensive episodes remained significant in the multivariate analysis. The most significant single factor that affected recurrence rate was the number of hypotensive episodes during the operative procedure. It is concluded that hypotensive episodes, even when well controlled, should be avoided during operation to maximize the chances of cure and prolong disease-free survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases. 
Two studies of pacing in the nursing home. Two studies concerning pacing by nursing home residents are presented. The first was a cross-sectional survey of 402 residents, which found that 39% of the subjects were pacers. In comparison to residents who did not pace, the pacers had fewer medical diagnoses, better appetites, and had resided in the facility for fewer years. Additionally, pacing was positively related to cognitive impairment and to past life-threatening experiences. Results of the second study, an observational study of six cognitively impaired residents who paced frequently, showed that these residents paced more when the environmental conditions were conducive to pacing (e.g., adequate lighting, enough room within which to pace). We believe that pacing is a reflection of good health within the nursing home population and suggest that caregivers may want to encourage rather than inhibit this behavior in some nursing home residents. 
Helicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer. Most patients with chronic duodenal ulcer (DU) craters have gastritis associated with Helicobacter pylori (HP), now thought to be the major cause of DU. A smaller proportion of DU patients have no detectable HP. In this study, we examined the frequency and causes of HP-negative duodenal ulcers. In 302 consecutive patients with endoscopic diagnosis of duodenal ulcer, 284 (94%) were found to have associated HP gastritis, whereas 18 (6%) were HP-negative on histology, culture, and urease test. The largest subgroup of HP-negative patients (8/18) was made up of those who had been taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), followed closely (4/18) by patients with recent intake of antibiotics. Causes of DU in the remaining subgroups included two patients with duodenal Crohn's disease, two with Gastrospirillum hominis infection, one with penetrating carcinoma of the pancreas and one with no detectable cause. We conclude that, although the most common causal factor of duodenal ulcer is HP, some 6% of DU's will be HP-negative, signaling unusual etiology. It is now important to identify the cause of duodenal ulcer so as to initiate appropriate therapy. 
Health implications of obesity. The health risks of obesity increase with its severity and reach significance at a weight greater than 20% above optimal, by using life insurance tables, or at a body mass index greater than 27. Risks include hypertension, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and, in some studies, high total-and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. There is an increased mortality from endometrial cancer in women and from colorectal cancer in men. Chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, sleep apnea, gout, and degenerative joint disease can occur with more severe obesity. The distribution of body fat is directly related to these health risks. Abdominal obesity is more dangerous than gluteal-femoral obesity because the amount of intraabdominal fat seems to determine much of the increased peril; therefore, risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes increase with abdominal obesity, even independently of total fat mass. 
Helicobacter pylori and gastric histamine concentrations. An enzyme isotopic assay was used to determine the histamine concentration in the gastric mucosa of patients positive for Helicobacter pylori with (n = 11) and without duodenal ulceration (n = 9) and in negative controls (n = 7). A significant difference was observed when the histamine content of H pylori negative subjects was compared with that of positive patients. On the other hand, there was no significant difference in histamine concentration between H pylori positive patients with duodenal ulceration and those without duodenal ulceration. H pylori positive patients with and without duodenal ulceration had significantly lower gastric histamine concentrations than H pylori negative subjects. The lower gastric histamine concentration observed in H pylori positive patients might be due to increased histamine release which could in turn induce increased gastric acid secretion. 
Review of fluorescein angiograms performed in one year. In this study 374 consecutive fundus fluorescein angiograms (FFAs) were performed on 330 patients. Of these, 165 (50%) were investigated for age related maculopathy. In only 12% did this investigation lead to an alteration in treatment. The remaining 50% of angiograms were requested for diabetic patients (15%), retinal vein occlusion (5%), tumours (6%), and various other disorders. In the diabetic patients treatment could have proceeded without FFA in 24% of patients who underwent it. Missed diagnoses corrected by angiography and areas where unnecessary angiograms were performed were identified. One interesting subgroup of eight patients with unexplained loss of central vision was identified. Careful clinical examination had failed to reveal any abnormality. FFAs were of no diagnostic value in these patients. 
An analysis of sequential physiologic changes in hypoxic cor pulmonale during long-term oxygen therapy. Physiologic changes were studied retrospectively in 37 patients with hypoxic cor pulmonale who died during long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT). The subjects were assessed during periods of clinical stability for each year on LTOT. At the onset of treatment, their mean age (+/- SEM) was 60.0 +/- 1.3 years, and at the time of death, they were aged 65.0 +/- 1.3 years. The median duration of LTOT was five years. For each year leading up to death, mean values of FEV1, PaO2, and PaCO2 were obtained. A rate of decline of FEV1 of 73 +/- 10 ml/yr was observed, and this was accompanied by a decline in PaO2 of 0.47 +/- 0.01 kPa/yr. Patients died with a mean FEV1 of 0.55 +/- 0.04 L and a PaO2 of 5.1 +/- 0.2 kPa. A small rise in PaCO2 occurred, on average 0.25 +/- 0.09 kPa/yr, throughout the study, but accelerating in many cases during the three years before death. Hypoxic cor pulmonale appears to be associated with a rapid deterioration in airway function, a steady decline in PaO2, and a slow rise in PaCO2 during the years leading up to death. These physiologic changes measured in a stable clinical state while breathing air appear to occur in spite of LTOT. The LTOT may merely prevent death from episodes of severe hypoxemia while the pathophysiologic changes in the lung progress. Hence the benefit to be expected from LTOT is only temporary. Generally, those patients with lower levels of FEV1 will obtain diminishing clinical benefit, inversely related to the severity of airflow obstruction at the time of commencement of LTOT. 
Soft tissue sarcoma of the pleural cavity. Seventeen cases of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) developing in the pleural cavity were collected from Japanese hospitals, and their clinical and pathologic findings summarized. Eight of the 17 patients had a 15-year to 50-year (mean, 28.8) history of chronic pleural inflammatory disease (pleuritis, pyothorax, and pulmonary tuberculosis) before the onset of the pleural sarcoma. Histologically, malignant fibrous histiocytoma was the most common tumor type (11 cases), followed by angiosarcoma (four). The age at diagnosis of the sarcoma ranged from 15 to 74 years (mean, 58); the male-to-female ratio was 3.3:1. In the eight cases of sarcoma associated with chronic pleural inflammatory disease, male preponderance was more marked (7:1). The commonest presenting symptom was chest pain. A mass could be detected by chest roentgenograms in 13 patients and computed tomographic scans in 15 patients. No patient had distant metastases at first admission. Thirteen patients were treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. Thirteen of the 17 patients died 1 to 87 months (mean, 14.2) after therapy for STS. The actuarial 1-year survival rate was 38.5%. These findings suggest that long-standing pleural inflammation might be an etiologic factor for development of pleural STS. 
Hemidystonia due to a contralateral parieto-occipital metastasis: disappearance after removal of the mass lesion. A patient presented with left-sided hemidystonia. CT revealed a contralateral parieto-occipital mass lesion compressing the basal ganglia, which were spared by the mass. After microsurgical resection of the tumor, which was verified histologically as a metastasis of a large-cell anaplastic carcinoma, the movement disorder dissolved completely. 
Diagnosis and treatment of primary and recurrent retroperitoneal liposarcoma. We retrospectively reviewed 16 patients in whom primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma was diagnosed and treated. These patients were classified according to the first definitive surgical procedure employed: complete excision with or without radiotherapy; partial excision followed by radiotherapy; only biopsy of tumor followed by radiotherapy. Distribution of tumors according to histologic type was: well differentiated myxoid type, 10; poorly differentiated myxoid type, 4; and mixed type, 2. The main factor in determining resectability was extent and fixation of tumor to vital structures. Recurrent retroperitoneal disease developed in four patients all of whom underwent secondary intervention. We concluded from our experience that complete surgical excision is the most effective primary therapeutic approach for patients with primary and recurrent retroperitoneal liposarcoma. 
Anger and hostility in tension-type headache. A battery of standardized psychometric tests was administered to a group of 47 episodic tension-type headache sufferers and 47 headache-free controls. Compared to controls, headache subjects showed higher levels of anxiety, depression, and anger/hostility. The groups did not differ significantly on a measure of anger expressed toward persons or objects, but headache subjects showed significantly greater levels of suppressed anger. The results provide objective data that are in general agreement with predictions derived from psychosomatic theories about the interrelationships among anxiety,. 
Brain biopsy in tuberculoma: the risks and benefits. In developing countries, 5 to 8% of the space-occupying lesions of the central nervous system are tuberculomas. Diagnosis can be difficult in the absence of extracranial tuberculosis; computed tomography is suggestive only. To assess the value of brain biopsies in tuberculomas, the records of 15 patients aged 6 to 80 years were reviewed. Histological confirmation was obtained in 15 patients, and acid-fast bacilli were cultured from 12 patients. Intracranial hypertension was the principal sign in 11 patients; other neurological signs were related to the location of the tuberculoma. One patient had evidence of extracranial tuberculosis. Biopsy-related complications consisted of an epidural hematoma in 1 patient and hydrocephalus in another; both required additional surgery. One case of tuberculous meningitis was probably related to surgery and poor drug compliance. There was no postoperative mortality. Thirteen patients (2 were lost to follow-up) were cured after an average of 16 months of antituberculous therapy. It was concluded that the brain biopsy is useful in diagnosing tuberculoma but that there is some associated risk. 
Portal vein thrombosis complicating endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. Convincing further evidence. Portal vein thrombosis occurred in a patient who bled from gastric varices that developed after obliteration of esophageal varices by endoscopic sclerotherapy. This complication was recognized only at surgery when thrombectomy and endovenectomy preceded the successful placement of an end-to-side portocaval shunt. At histopathology, the presence of an amorphous, eosinophilic material staining negatively for fibrin and similar to sclerosant injected at sclerotherapy was observed within the clot. This latter finding, previously unreported, provides convincing evidence for the causal relationship of portal vein thrombosis to endoscopic sclerotherapy. 
Second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and the risk of subsequent fetal death BACKGROUND. The finding of an elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein during the second trimester of pregnancy may indicate that the fetus has died or is about to die. It is uncertain, however, whether the finding is associated with an increased risk of fetal death later in gestation independent of known causes of elevation, such as the presence of neural-tube defects or multiple gestation. METHODS. To address this question, we performed a case-control study of 612 women whose pregnancies ended in fetal death and 2501 women who gave birth to live infants, using reports from California vital statistics for 1987. All the women had signleton pregnancies and alpha-fetoprotein screening in the second trimester. RESULTS. Women with elevated levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy had an increased risk of fetal death, and the risk was increased until term. Women with the highest levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein--greater than or equal to 3.0 times the median value--had a very high risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 10.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.9 to 22.0) as compared with women who had normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein. Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels that were 2.0 to 2.9 times the median were also associated with an elevated risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.4). Elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein were especially likely to be associated with fetal death in cases in which maternal hypertension or placental infarction was also present. CONCLUSIONs. An unexplained elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of subsequent fetal death, up to four to five months after alpha-fetoprotein screening. 
Bilateral coronary ostial stenosis associated with aortitis syndrome. A patient with aortitis syndrome showed severe stenosis of the bilateral coronary ostium. We discuss the coronary angiographic findings and the treatment. 
Diagnostic accuracy of thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging. Myocardial thallium-201 (Tl-201) imaging performed in conjunction with exercise stress has enhanced the accuracy of detecting coronary artery disease among patients with chest pain. Sensitivity and specificity of qualitative visual Tl-201 scintigraphy for detection of coronary artery disease average 84% and 87%, respectively. Quantitative analysis of planar Tl-201 scintigrams has yielded sensitivity and specificity in the 90% range. Single photon emission computed tomographic imaging is associated with even higher sensitivity but with specificity in the 82-85% range. Perfusion defects representing ischemia can now be distinguished from scar by demonstration of delayed Tl-201 redistribution or enhanced uptake after reinjection of a second dose of Tl-201. Stenoses of the left circumflex coronary artery are less easily detected than lesions of the right and left anterior descending coronary arteries. False-positive Tl-201 perfusion defects may occur as a result of attenuation artifacts, most often caused by overlying breast tissue or by a high left hemidiaphragm. Patient motion during acquisition of single photon emission computed tomographic images results in artifactual defects on reconstruction. Abnormal Tl-201 uptake has been noted in patients with 1) left bundle branch block and normal coronary arteries, 2) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 3) progressive systemic sclerosis. 
Liver histology, blood biochemistry and RNA, DNA and subcellular protein composition of various skeletal muscles of rats with experimental cirrhosis: implications for alcoholic muscle disease. (1) Liver cirrhosis was induced in male rats by treatment with carbon tetrachloride and phenobarbitone for 130-142 days. Detailed histological examination showed all livers from rats treated with carbon tetrachloride had annular fibrosis, necrosis, loss of normal hepatic architecture and other features that were consistent with an established micronodular cirrhosis. (2) Plasma biochemical analysis showed a significant reduction in total protein concentration (13%), which was due entirely to a reduction in plasma albumin (29%). There were also large increases in the plasma activities of alkaline phosphatase (110%) and aspartate aminotransferase (159%), when compared to phenobarbitone-treated controls. Plasma cholesterol was also increased (67%), but other plasma analytes were not significantly altered. (3) The soleus (Type I), plantaris (Type II) and gastrocnemius (Types I and II) muscles were dissected and examined for possible differential effects. There were minor reductions in all three muscle weights, but these changes did not reach statistical significance. The protein, RNA and DNA concentrations, total muscle content and content relative to body weight in cirrhotic rats were also not significantly altered in any of the muscles. Cirrhosis did not cause any perturbations in derived parameters, i.e. amount of synthetic apparatus per cell, RNA/DNA ratio, apparent cell size, protein/DNA ratio and the capacity for protein synthesis or RNA/protein ratio. (4) The gastrocnemius was fractionated into soluble, stromal and myofibrillar proteins. The concentrations and contents of all three proteins were unaltered in cirrhotic animals, compared to controls. (5) It is concluded that in this experimental model of cirrhosis there were no effects on those skeletal muscle variables which are strikingly altered by chronic alcohol feeding. 
Perinatal vertical transmission of human papillomavirus and subsequent development of respiratory tract papillomatosis. This study prospectively examined the potential for human papillomavirus (HPV) to be transmitted vertically to newborns during delivery. Exfoliated cervical cells were extracted from 72 pregnant women during the third trimester and again during labor prior to delivery, and tested for the presence of HPV DNA. These results were compared with HPV DNA specimens from their newborns, who were sampled by exfoliated cells from the oral-pharyngeal cavity and vulva or tissue from the foreskin 24 to 72 hours after delivery. Among the mothers, 18.1% (13 of 72) typed HPV-positive by the ViraPap/ViraType DNA hybridization technique. Two neonates (2.8% or 2 of 72) tested positive from oral-pharyngeal specimens. This finding supports the hypothesis that respiratory tract papillomatosis may develop as a result of perinatal vertical transmission of HPV. Furthermore, this study suggests that neither cesarean section nor prepartum treatment of HPV lesions will always protect against neonatal acquisition of HPV. 
Postural compensation in children with congenital or early acquired bilateral vestibular loss. The relative roles of different receptor systems in compensating for vestibular loss were studied in 18 children (12 to 16 years of age) with congenital or early acquired bilateral vestibular loss (BVL) and impaired hearing, and compared to that in 33 normal children (9 to 16 years of age). Postural stability was studied with posturography evaluating the velocity of anterior-posterior body sway. With closed eyes the increase of sway velocity did not differ between the groups, either with or without simultaneous proprioceptive disturbances when the subjects were standing on a bare surface. Body sway velocities were found to increase more in subjects with a BVL than in normal children when subjects were standing on foam rubber. When proprioceptive cues were disturbed, body sway velocities increased in both groups, but significantly more in children with BVL when subjects stood on foam rubber. This occurred both with and without open eyes. 
Tissue plasminogen activator as an alternative to vena cava interruption in recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism. We have described a woman with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) who had acute dyspnea, chest pain, and hypotension during adequate heparin therapy. Pulmonary angiography was consistent with recurrent PTE. The patient was given intravenous TPA and showed significant improvement. Repeat angiography showed resolution of the thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery. The patient did not require vena cava interruption. 
Discourse analyses with closed head injured adults: evidence for differing patterns of deficits. To better characterize the verbal impairments of higher level closed head injured (CHI) adults, we used narrative stories to longitudinally sample their discourse abilities. Stories were analyzed at the levels of intersentential cohesion and story grammar. Two differing patterns of deficits that emerged are described. In the first, a CHI subject demonstrated excessive verbalization characterized by poorly organized, but task-appropriate, content. In the second, a CHI subject demonstrated fair to good organization but little appropriate content. Prognostically, the presence of appropriate, although disorganized, content was an early indication that the subject was able to appreciate potential relationships of characters in the stimulus picture. The second pattern represented a more severe cognitive dysfunction. This subject's attempts at stories, although well organized, were merely elaborate descriptions of the picture. Discourse analyses appear to be well suited for the assessment of CHI adults. 
Lewy bodies are immunoreactive with antibodies raised to gelsolin related amyloid-Finnish type. Lewy bodies (LB) are intraneuronal, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. They are invariably present in Parkinson's and diffuse LB diseases. Their composition by direct biochemical methods is unknown, although LBs are immunoreactive with a number of antibodies, including anti-ubiquitin and anti-neurofilament antibodies. Familial amyloidosis, Finnish type (FAF), is an autosomal-dominant form of systemic amyloidosis. The authors have isolated and partially sequenced the amyloid. The protein has significant sequence identity with gelsolin, an actin-modulating protein. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised to the FAF amyloid not only immunostain the amyloid but also LBs in the cortex and substantia nigra of Parkinson's and diffuse LB disease brains. Immunoreactivity is absorbed by the purified amyloid but is unaffected by ubiquitin. This provides a link between the LB and one of the human amyloidoses, FAF. 
Monitoring functional patency of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Duplex scanning and Doppler-derived blood pressure measurements were used to serially monitor lower limb hemodynamics in 73 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Ninety percutaneous transluminal angioplasty sites judged technically satisfactory by arteriography were evaluated. Significant hemodynamic improvement was seen in 81 (90%) of the 90 limbs, although both hemodynamic and clinical improvement were achieved in only 77 (86%) limbs. Duplex scanning within 1 week of successful angioplasty identified moderate (20% to 49% diameter reduction) or severe (greater than 50% diameter reduction) residual stenosis in 49 (63%) of 77 balloon-dilated arterial segments. The presence of a greater than 50% diameter reduction residual stenosis predicted further restenosis and late clinical failure (11% success rate at 1 year). When the degree of residual stenosis at the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty site was less than 50% diameter reduction by duplex scanning, the procedure was durable (80% success rate at 2 years), even in patients with critical ischemia, poor runoff, or diabetes mellitus. 
Vulvar vestibulitis syndrome: a clinico-pathological study. Twenty four patients with the vulvar vestibulitis syndrome formed the basis of this clinicopathological study. Entry dyspareunia was the constant presenting complaint and vestibular erythema with acute superficial tenderness the invariable clinical finding. In our series there was a marked predominance of Caucasians, patients were most often of social classes I and II and most frequently in the third decade. The results of laboratory investigation revealed that this syndrome has a diverse range of potential aetiologies including vulval infections, dysplasia and in one instance acute vasculitis. 
Ventilatory response to sustained hypoxia during exercise. The ventilatory stimulating effects of hypoxia occurring at carotid bodies are potentiated by exercise. However, hypoxia also has central ventilatory depressive effects; the potential interactions between this hypoxic depression and exercise have not been studied. We examined the ventilatory response to a 20 min period of isocapnic hypoxia (end-tidal O2, PETO2, of 50 mm Hg), preceded and followed by a 5 min period of isocapnic hyperoxia in seven normal adult males at rest and during moderate exercise (45-75 W). When hypoxia was introduced at rest (PETO2 = 42 mmHg), ventilation initially increased from 13.73 +/- 3.04 (mean +/- SD) to 23.69 +/- 5.48 1.min-1 and then slowly declined to 19.01 +/- 4.68 1 min-1. The increase was caused by increases in tidal volume and respiratory frequency, but the decline was solely in tidal volume. During a background of moderate exercise (PETCO2 = 46 mmHg), introduction of hypoxia caused ventilation to increase from 30.84 +/- 6.31 to 56.44 +/- 10.58 1.min-1. Ventilation subsequently did not decline; at the end of the hypoxic period, ventilation was 57.06 +/- 12.59 1.min-1. The increase was also associated with an increase in tidal volume and respiratory frequency, as seen as rest, but with much larger magnitudes. Despite the absence of ventilatory decline, there was still a decline in tidal volume, but it was compensated by an increase in respiratory frequency. We conclude that exercise potentiated the acute ventilatory response to hypoxia by modifying both tidal volume and respiratory frequency but that exercise abolished or greatly reduced hypoxic decline by increasing respiratory rate. 
Neurological and neuropathological sequelae of correction of chronic hyponatremia. The effect of correction of chronic hyponatremia at different rates was studied in 91 rats maintained at a plasma [Na+] of 112 +/- 1 mmol/liter for 19 +/- 1 days. Hyponatremia was corrected into normal ranges (140 to 145 mmol/liter) using three different methods. Rats corrected by water restriction achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 2.1 +/- 0.2 day and had a maximal (4 hr) correction rate of 1.0 +/- 0.1 mmol/liter.hr; rats corrected by water diuresis achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 1.6 +/- 0.1 day and had a maximal correction rate of 2.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/liter.hr; rats corrected by hypertonic saline infusion achieved normal plasma [Na+] by 5.4 +/- 0.3 hr and had a maximal correction rate of 5.7 +/- 0.4 mmol/liter.hr. A fourth control group was not corrected. No demyelinative lesions were found in the brains from the uncorrected rats, whereas the occurrence of such lesions in the brains of the corrected rats was highly correlated with the maximal rate of increase in plasma [Na+] (r = 0.68, P less than 0.001), and to a lesser degree with the magnitude of the increase in plasma [Na+] over the first 24 hours of correction (r = 0.41, P less than 0.001). Brain myelinolysis was first observed in animals whose maximal (4 hr) rate of correction exceeded 1.75 mmol/liter.hr, and the incidence of demyelination increased progressively in rats with more rapid rates of correction. Similarly, myelinolysis was first observed in rats whose magnitude of correction at 24 hours exceeded 16 mmol/liter and also increased in rats with larger 24 hour magnitudes of correction. 
Multielement analysis of kidney tissue with renal calculi. Tissue distribution and concentration gradients of macro- and micro-elements in the papilla, medulla, and cortex of human kidney with renal calculi were measured with spectrometer. An uninvolved portion of the hypernephroma kidney was used as control. Cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), and molybdenum (Mo) were least in amount in renal papilla as compared with the cortex and medulla in renal stone kidney. Overall there was less Mo in stone kidney tissue, and also significantly less when compared with that of control renal papilla. Considering the reported fact that Mo was found in high concentrations in urinary tract stones and our data that Mo was less in stone kidney, it is speculated that Mo may play some unexplained but significant role in certain stage(s) of the stone formation. 
A fatality after antipyrine administration. An 87-year-old woman died after the administration of an intravenous injection of antipyrine during the course of an investigation of the efficacy of oxerutins in venous ulceration. This is believed to be the first such fatality. 
Heterozygous protein C deficiency associated with multiple congenital hemangiomas--a case report. Congenital protein C deficiency is described as associated with recurrent thrombotic manifestations. The proband, a fourteen-year-old female, has a history of severe and frequent thrombotic disease, moreover, she presents congenital multiple hemangiomas. Family history was positive for protein C deficiency since the mother of the proposita is also affected and has manifested deep venous thrombophlebitis. Two additional relatives on the maternal side were not available for study but were reported to be symptomatic. None of the family members presented angiomatosis. This case report represents the first description of the association of protein C deficiency with multiple hemangiomas. 
Relationship between fetal biophysical activities and umbilical cord blood gas values. In a prospective study of 62 patients undergoing cesarean section before the onset of labor a fetal biophysical profile assessment was performed within 3 hours before the cesarean section. The presence or absence of the individual fetal biophysical activities (fetal heart rate reactivity, fetal breathing movements, fetal body movements, and fetal tone) were correlated with umbilical cord blood gas and acid-base measurements (artery and vein). Fetuses with nonreactive nonstress test results or the absence of breathing had significantly lower cord artery pH, PO2 bicarbonate, and base excess measurements but not a significantly different PCO2 level as compared with fetuses that had these activities present. Fetuses with the absence of movements or tone had lower pH, PO2 bicarbonate, and base excess levels and higher PCO2 levels as compared with fetuses with the presence of movements or tone, respectively. These blood gas and acid-base differences were observed in both umbilical cord artery and vein. Subsequent analysis of the blood gas and acid-base measurements of the fetuses with compromised biophysical activities revealed that there are different levels of acidemia, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia at which the individual biophysical activities are compromised. These data suggest that the first manifestations of fetal hypoxemia and acidemia are nonreactive nonstress test results and loss of fetal breathing; in advanced acidemia, hypoxemia, and hypercapnia fetal movements and fetal tone are compromised. 
Barrett's esophagus. A continuing conundrum. Barrett's esophagus, a condition in which the distal esophagus is lined by columnar epithelium, is almost always caused by gastroesophageal reflux and often occurs in conjunction with a sliding hiatal hernia. Patients are typically white men in their 50s who smoke and drink, and they present with complaints of regurgitation, heartburn, and/or dysphagia. Endoscopic biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Complications, such as stricture, ulcer, dysplasia, and malignant degeneration, occur in many cases. Adenocarcinoma is the most serious complication. Medical treatment, including life-style changes as well as pharmacologic therapy, usually relieves symptoms and heals esophagitis, but when it fails, antireflux surgery is indicated. Patients without evidence of dysplasia should undergo endoscopy yearly; those with mild dysplasia require more frequent surveillance. If biopsies disclose severe dysplasia, esophagogastrectomy should be performed. 
Molecular epidemiology and the genetics of environmental cancer. Environmental, occupational, and recreational exposures to carcinogens contribute to cancer risk in humans. Cancer formation is a multistage process involving tumor initiation, promotion, conversion, and progression. Carcinogens can affect any of these stages through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The association of a suspected carcinogenic exposure and cancer risk can be studied in populations with classic epidemiologic techniques. However, these techniques are not applicable to the assessment of risk in individuals. Molecular epidemiology, in contrast, is a field that integrates molecular biology, in vitro and in vivo laboratory models, biochemistry, and epidemiology to infer individual cancer risk. Carcinogen-macromolecular adduct levels, and somatic cell mutations can be measured to determine the biologically effective dose of a carcinogen. Molecular epidemiology also explores host cancer susceptibilities, such as carcinogen metabolic activation, DNA repair, endogenous mutation rates, and inheritance of mutated tumor suppressor genes. Substantial interindividual variation for each of these biologic end points has been shown and, therefore, highlights the need for assessing cancer risk on an individual basis. Given the pace of the last decade, it is feasible that the next 10 years will allow molecular epidemiologists to develop a cancer-risk profile for an individual that includes assessment of a number of factors. This will help focus preventive strategies and strengthen quantitative risk assessments. 
A genetic study of idiopathic focal dystonias. A genetic study of idiopathic focal dystonias was undertaken by examining 153 first-degree relatives of 40 index patients with torticollis (14 patients), other focal cranial dystonias (16 patients), and writer's cramp (10 patients). Nine relatives with dystonia were identified in 6 families; 8 of these had symptoms such as clumsiness or tremor, but none were aware of any dystonia. A further 4 relatives, now decreased, were affected by history. Overall, 25% of index patients had relatives with dystonia. The results of segregation analysis suggested the presence of an autosomal dominant gene or genes with reduced penetrance as a common cause for focal dystonia. Segregation ratios were not significantly different from those ratios observed in generalized or segmental dystonia in the United Kingdom, and it is possible that a single autosomal dominant gene mutation is responsible for inherited dystonia in the majority of patients irrespective of distribution or severity. 
Laryngeal papillomas: histomorphometric evaluation of multiple and solitary lesions. Laryngeal papillomas from 20 patients (162 papillomas) were subjected to histomorphometric analysis: Based on clinical parameters, the papillomas were divided into juvenile multiple papillomas, adult multiple papillomas and adult solitary papillomas. The volume fractions of basal cells, koilocytes and nuclei as well as the mean nuclear volume were determined for each group. Significant differences between the 3 groups were not found and it is therefore concluded that they all represent the same basic lesion. 
Herniated cervical disk presenting as ischemic chest pain. Myocardial ischemia must be the first concern of every emergency physician in evaluating chest pain in the adult patient. Any suspicion of myocardial ischemia must be promptly evaluated and admitted. The American College of Emergency Physicians has recently published a standards document on the care of chest pain in the adult patient. The emergency physician must be familiar with this document. Once myocardial ischemia and other life-threatening causes are ruled out, one can consider that cervical disk disease may be the cause of chest pain. We present two cases of patients who presented to the emergency department with signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia. Both patients were found to have herniated cervical disks. Subsequent surgical repair completely relieved their symptoms. Evaluation of the literature shows that this entity was well described from 1950 to the 1960s. Most recent discussions do not mention disk herniation as even an infrequent cause of chest pain. If there is no life-threatening disease present, one should consider cervical disk disease. 
Nonhealing leg ulcers: a manifestation of basal cell carcinoma. Seven patients with basal cell carcinomas presenting as nonhealing ulcers are reported. The importance of considering malignancy and taking biopsy specimens of leg ulcers that fail to respond to treatment is emphasized. 
Hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritis: electron microscopic studies in 98 children. Ninety-eight children with glomerulonephritis concomitant with hepatitis B surface HBs antigenemia were studied, the antigenemia being first documented at the clinical onset of glomerulopathy. Initial diagnoses, based on examination of the paraffin sections, varied, membrano-proliferative, mesangial, and membranous glomerulonephritis being most frequently considered. However, electron microscopic examination showed that 77 children had a uniform type of glomerulopathy, irrespective of the light microscopic appearance. This type was diagnosed as secondary membranous glomerulonephritis. The clinical course of this nephropathy was relatively indolent and short. Moreover, in many children, elimination of some hepatitis B virus (HBV) antigens from the circulation was also associated with clinical remission of glomerulopathy. The remaining 21 children with HBs antigenemia had various morphological forms of glomerulonephritis, these being similar to their idiopathic counterparts in both morphology and clinical course. The distinct clinical and morphological picture of secondary membranous glomerulonephritis with HBs antigenemia occurring in 77 of 98 children supports the hypothesis that HBsV-associated glomerulonephritis is of the secondary membranous type. Thus, we conclude that in children HBV antigenemia associated with glomerulonephritis other than secondary membranous is coincidental. 
Association of human leukocyte class II antigens with rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease in a Brazilian population. BACKGROUND. The incidence of rheumatic heart disease is great in Brazil. We analyzed the distribution of human leukocyte (HLA) antigens in a Brazilian population sample with rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease, with the aim of better understanding the mechanisms involved. METHODS AND RESULTS. HLA class I (A, B, and C) and class II (DR and DQ) antigen distribution was studied in 40 patients with diagnosis of rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease and compared with a control group of 617 healthy individuals for class I typing, from which 118 were drawn for class II typing. A strong correlation between rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease and HLA-DRw53 (72.9% in the disease group versus 39% in the control group: p = 0.00061, relative risk, 4.2; etiologic fraction, 0.43) was found. We also found an increase in the frequency of HLA-DR7 (57.5% in the disease group versus 26.3% in control group: p = 0.00715; relative risk, 3.8; etiologic fraction, 0.56). HLA class I and HLA-DQ typing did not point to any association with these diseases. CONCLUSIONS. HLA-DR7 and HLA-DRw53 are markers for susceptibility to rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Brazil. These results could be explained by genetic differences resulting from racial or geographical diversity. 
Surgically treated cavernous angiomas of the brain stem: report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of surgically treated brain stem cavernous angiomas are presented. The previously reported cases are reviewed and the clinical features, radiographic appearance, and treatment of this condition are discussed. Symptomatic brain stem cavernous angiomas should be treated surgically and can be removed with good outcomes. 
Molecular diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: polymerase chain reaction amplification of T-cell antigen receptor beta-chain gene rearrangements. The goal of our study was to molecularly diagnose CTCL, by cloning the T-cell antigen receptor beta chain (TCR-beta) gene rearrangement from the malignant T cells of a patient with Sezary syndrome, in order to generate a specific oligonucleotide probe capable of detecting CTCL cells through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Total RNA isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes was reverse transcribed and resultant first strand cDNA was PCR amplified utilizing a concensus primer to the TCR-beta variable region (V beta) and a 3' primer to the TCR-beta constant region (C beta). PCR reaction products were subcloned into a plasmid vector and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that the patient's in-frame TCR-beta gene rearrangement utilized V beta 6.4, D beta 1.1, J beta 2.2, and C beta 2.1 gene segments. Oligo-primers to V beta 6.4 and J beta 2.2 were utilized to PCR amplify genomic DNA taken from the patient's blood and involved skin. Screening the amplified DNA with an oligo-probe specific for the patient's V-D-J junctional sequences resulted in the detection of the patient-specific sequences. No sequences were detected from DNA from other malignant or benign infiltrates. Thus, we have defined a "molecular fingerprint" specific for a patient's malignant T-cells and can molecularly diagnose CTCL through PCR amplification. 
Functional role of the epicardium in postinfarction ventricular tachycardia. Observations derived from computerized epicardial activation mapping, entrainment, and epicardial laser photoablation BACKGROUND. Conventionally, monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardia in patients with remote myocardial infarction is believed to originate from the subendocardium. In a previous study, we demonstrated that electrical activation patterns during ventricular tachycardia occasionally suggest a subepicardial rather than subendocardial reentry. METHODS AND RESULTS. This study prospectively evaluated the functional role of the epicardium in postinfarction ventricular tachycardia with complex intraoperative techniques including computerized electrical activation mapping, entrainment, observation of changes in activation pattern during successful epicardial laser photoblation, and histological study. Five of 10 consecutive patients undergoing intraoperative computerized activation mapping had 10 ventricular tachycardia morphologies displaying epicardial diastolic activation These 10 "epicardial" ventricular tachycardias revealed the following global activation patterns: monoregional spread (two), figure-eight activation (five), and circular macroreentry (three). Entrainment of ventricular tachycardia using epicardial stimulation was successfully performed from an area of slow diastolic conduction in four tachycardia morphologies. During entrainment, global activation remained undisturbed with recordings showing a long stimulus to QRS interval, unchanged QRS morphology, and pacing capture of all components of the reentry circuit. Neodymium:yttrium aluminum garnet laser photocoagulation was delivered during ventricular tachycardia to epicardial sites of presumed reentry. Epicardial photoablation terminated five of five figure-eight tachycardias, two of three circular macroreentry tachycardias but not the monoregional tachycardias. Electrophysiological recordings during epicardial laser photocoagulation demonstrated progressive prolongation of ventricular tachycardia cycle length and apparent interruption of the presumed reentrant circuit. Histological evaluation of the reentrant region (three patients) showed a rim of surviving myocardium under the epicardial surface. CONCLUSIONS. This study suggests that 1) chronic postinfarction ventricular tachycardia may result from subepicardial macroreentry, 2) slow conduction within the reentry circuit can be localized by computerized mapping and epicardial entrainment, and 3) ventricular tachycardia interruption by laser photocoagulation results from conduction delay and block within critical elements of the reentrant pathway. Viable subepicardial muscle fibers may constitute the underlying pathology. 
Interleukin-6 in serum of patients with polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis. Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis are diseases which are characterized by a brisk acute phase response. Cytokines, principally interleukin-1 and interleukin-6, are thought to mediate the release of acute phase proteins from hepatocytes. Employing a sensitive bioassay based on the hybridoma growth factor properties of interleukin-6, we investigated its levels in sequential sera obtained from 15 initially untreated patients with PMR/GCA. We found that interleukin-6 activity was significantly elevated in all untreated patients. Although there was a significant decline in its levels after successful steroid therapy, seven patients continued to have raised serum levels of interleukin-6 for up to 6 months after initiation of treatment. Activated endothelial cells are a potent source of interleukin-6 and its persistence in the circulation may be taken as evidence of continuing disease activity. What is not explicable is the normalization of the acute phase response soon after the commencement of steroid therapy when circulating levels of interleukin-6 are still high. This suggests that steroids may be having additional effects on hepatocyte function. 
Effect of nasal packing on eustachian tube function. Sixty-three patients undergoing surgery to the nasal septum followed by bilateral packing had pre- and post-operative tympanometry in order to determine the effect on eustachian tube function. Fifty-five of the 126 ears tested (46 per cent) developed a reduction in middle ear pressure of at least 50 daPa; 76 per cent became normal within 24 hours of removing the nasal packs. All ears were asymptomatic and no patient had evidence of middle ear effusion. Nasal packing following septal surgery is a frequent cause of short-lasting eustachian tube dysfunction but rarely severe enough to cause symptoms or middle ear effusion. Tubal dysfunction is most likely due to a combination of surgical oedema and a direct effect of the nasal packing. 
Clinical evaluation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Jordan. Thirty-three cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma are reported. This is the first report of this condition from Jordan. Age, sex, early presentation and metastases are discussed. Bimodal distribution of age showed two peaks between 16-20 and 41-45 years. The disease was more common in males. Lymph node enlargement was the most common presentation, and bone metastases were the most frequent. 
Fatal varicella in an adult: case report and review of the gastrointestinal complications of chickenpox. An unusual and fatal case of primary varicella in an adult is presented. Involvement of the small intestine first manifested as abdominal pain and later progressed to gastrointestinal bleeding with subsequent dissemination of the infection. Although it has previously been speculated that gastrointestinal bleeding can result from infection with the varicella-zoster virus, the data from this case include histologic and cultural evidence that supports the clinical observations. The literature has been reviewed, and the management of this patient has been critically evaluated. 
Results from 7-mm bilateral recessions of the medial rectus muscles for congenital esotropia. We reviewed the surgical records of 77 patients who had undergone 7-mm bilateral medial rectus recessions for large-angle congenital esotropia. The mean age of onset of esotropia in these patients was 3.5 months, and the mean age at the time of surgery was 12.9 months. The mean preoperative deviation was 69 delta of esotropia. This procedure resulted in satisfactory horizontal alignment in 47 patients (61%) at their latest follow-up examination (mean, 27 months; range, 6 months to 6 years). The esotropia was undercorrected in 21 patients (27%) and overcorrected in nine (12%). Amblyopia was noted in 30%, oblique muscle dysfunction in 44%, and dissociated vertical deviation in 36% of the patients. Regression analysis of multiple variables showed alignment at 6 weeks to be the only predictor of the final outcome (R = .83). Extramacular fusion was achieved in 10 of 11 patients for whom reliable sensory data were available. The mean age at surgery of these patients was 9.7 months. Seven-millimeter bilateral medial rectus recessions are an effective alternative to three- and four-muscle procedures in the initial treatment of large-angle congenital esotropia during infancy. 
Simultanagnosia. To see but not two see. Simultanagnosia is a disorder of visual perception characterized by the inability to interpret complex visual arrays despite preserved recognition of single objects. We report a series of investigations on a simultanagnosic patient which attempt to establish the nature of this visual processing disturbance. The patient performed normally on a feature detection task but was impaired on a test of attention-requiring visual search in which she was asked to distinguish between stimuli containing different numbers of targets. She was not impaired on a visual-spatial orienting task. She identified single briefly presented words and objects as rapidly and reliably as controls suggesting that access to stored structural descriptions was not impaired. With brief, simultaneous presentation of 2 words or drawings, she identified both stimuli significantly more frequently when the stimuli were semantically related than when they were unrelated. On the basis of these and other data, we suggest that the patient's simultanagnosia is attributable to an impairment in the process by which activated structural descriptions are linked to information coding the location of the object. 
Chemical and postural influence on scalene and diaphragmatic activation in humans. The electromyographic activity of the diaphragm (EMGdi) and scalene muscle (EMGsc) was studied in the supine and upright positions, respectively, during hyperoxic progressive hypercapnic rebreathing (HCVR) in five healthy males. End-expiratory esophageal pressure (EEPes) was quantified on a breath-to-breath basis as a reflection of altered end-expiratory lung volume. There was no significant difference in the slopes of EMGdi, expressed as a percentage of maximum at total lung capacity vs. minute volume of ventilation (VI), between the supine and upright positions [0.79 +/- 0.05 (SE) vs. 0.92 +/- 0.17, respectively]. In contrast, the slope of the regression line relating EMGsc to VI was steeper in the upright than in the supine position (0.69 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.35 +/- 0.04, respectively; P less than 0.005). Positive EEPes at comparable VI at the ends of HCVRs were of greater magnitude upright than supine (3.27 +/- 0.68 vs. 4.35 +/- 0.60 cmH2O, respectively, P less than 0.001). We conclude that altering posture has a greater effect on scalene and expiratory muscle activity than on diaphragmatic activity during hypercapnic stimulation. 
Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and life threatening chronic diarrhoea. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection is not generally thought to cause severe diarrhoea after the neonatal period. Patients admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children over the three years (1984-7) with diarrhoea and EPEC infection were reviewed. Clinical details, features of small intestinal mucosa, and treatment were recorded in those who developed chronic diarrhoea with failure to thrive. Twenty six children with EPEC required hospital admission for diarrhoea and six of these (23%) developed chronic diarrhoea. In contrast only two (5%) of 42 with other serogroups of E coli (p less than 0.01) and 28 (4%) of 764 children without EPEC admitted with acute diarrhoea developed chronic symptoms (p less than 0.01). EPEC serogroups detected in the stool of the six children with chronic diarrhoea were 0128 in three, 0114 in two, and 0119 in one. The patients' clinical characteristics were: previous good health, no significant immunodeficiency, age 4-10 months, foreign travel (three of six), severe life threatening secretory diarrhoea from 0.5 to 1.5 1 per day (four of six), small intestinal enteropathy (five of six) three of whom showed mucosal adherent, non-invasive E coli of the same serotype as that in the stool, in association with microvillous loss and pedestal formation. All were treated with hypoallergenic feeds, two with parenteral nutrition, and three with parenteral antibiotics. All eventually recovered. EPEC infection is a common treatable cause of life threatening chronic diarrhoea in infancy. 
Malignant osteopetrosis: hypercalcaemia after bone marrow transplantation. A 3 year old girl presented with malignant osteopetrosis, which was treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Successful engraftment was complicated by prolonged hypercalcaemia, which was controlled by a combination of a bisphosphonate, phosphate infusions, vigorous resalination, and salmon calcitonin. She was alive and well 16 months after the transplant. 
Repeat thymectomy in chronic refractory myasthenia gravis. Encouraged by recent results with "extended" thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis, we carried out repeat thymectomy in six patients with chronic, refractory disease who did not initially have extended thymectomy. All were completely disabled with longstanding myasthenia. Initial thymectomy (four transsternal, one transcervical, and one substernal) was carried out at a mean of 8.9 years previously (range, 5 to 18). There was no residual thymus observed with CT, but at repeat thymectomy, residual thymic tissue was present in five of six patients. Five patients significantly improved and four returned to full-time work. Mean prednisone dose declined from 51 mg to 18 mg/d, and mean pyridostigmine dose fell from 1,290 mg to 415 mg/d. No patient to date has had a complete remission. These results suggest that repeat thymectomy may benefit some patients with chronic disabling myasthenia gravis, especially when it is uncertain from a review of the operative report whether all thymic tissue was removed at the initial thymectomy. 
In vitro studies of uterine electrosurgery. This study investigated electrosurgical techniques in vitro with emphasis on the tissue effects and heat transfer through full-thickness blocks of excised uterine tissue. Uterine morphometry was also examined. The 7-mm cutting resection loop was associated with a surrounding zone of thermal necrosis between 1.07-1.40 mm. There was no variation in this zone when power was altered, but a statistically significant increase was demonstrated with duration of exposure. A depth of destruction of 3.24-3.49 mm was possible with the desiccating coagulation technique, but fulguration achieved a depth of only 1.70-1.78 mm. A greater tissue effect was demonstrated as time intervals were increased. There was a fall-off in the measured rise in temperature with distance; at 4 mm from the active electrode, a mean rise of 4.5C was noted, whereas at 12 mm the mean temperature rise was 3.9C. There was a statistically significant increase in the mean temperature as power output in the cutting mode was increased. At 180 W, the mean rise was 2.0C but by 260 W, it was 3.9C. When the time interval was increased and the power held constant (220 W), a mean rise of 2.5C was recorded at 1 second, compared with 4.6C at 5 seconds, achieving statistical significance. Power increments in the coagulating mode did not alter the temperature profile, but increasing duration of exposure was associated with a significant rise in mean temperature (from 0.8 to 4.6C). A stepwise increase in the baseline temperature was noted with repetitive insults. The mean myometrial thickness of the anterior and posterior walls measured 1.8 and 1.9 cm, respectively. 
Thrombocytosis in adults: analysis of 777 patients. A total of 777 patients with thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count of greater than 500 x 10(9)l-1, seen in a University hospital over a 1-year period, were studied prospectively for aetiology. The most frequent causes of thrombocytosis were infection (21.9%), rebound thrombocytosis (19.4%), tissue damage (17.9%), chronic inflammatory disorders (13.1%) and malignancy (5.9%). Thrombocytosis associated with multiple causative factors, occurring simultaneously, was seen in 6.1% of cases. Thrombocytosis of greater than or equal to 1 million x 10(9)l-1 was found most frequently in patients with multiple aetiological factors occurring at the same time, in myeloproliferative disorders, or in postsplenectomy patients. 
Identification of colon cancer-predisposed individuals: a cytogenetic analysis. Peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from 23 individuals with polyps and 10 age-matched controls were cytogenetically studied. Of 23 individuals with polyps, 13 were males and 10 females. The age distribution of these patients was between 22 and 84 yr, with a medium age of 49.6 yr. Chromosome 5 was involved in structural rearrangements in 10 of the 18 patients with adenomatous polyps (55.5%). All those who showed involvement of chromosome 5 alterations had either adenomatous polyps or Gardner's syndrome, and two had colon adenocarcinoma. Of the remainder who did not show involvement of chromosome 5, eight had adenomatous polyps and five had hyerplastic polyps (non-neoplastic). Of the 10 control samples, only one showed alteration of chromosome 5. Of the 10 adenomatous polyp subjects that showed chromosome 5 defects, two had translocations of chromosome 5 and the short arm of 17. Chromosome 5 was broken 13 times (5 times in the q arm and 8 times in the p arm). Based on our present cytogenetic data, we tentatively conclude that lymphocyte metaphases may be used to identify colon cancer-predisposed individuals. 
Clam enterocystoplasty in general urological practice. A series of 45 patients (31 female) underwent clam enterocystoplasty for urgency and incontinence. The majority had detrusor instability. Prolonged conservative treatment had failed in all cases. Improvement occurred in 71% and those younger than 30 years had better overall results; 29% remained incontinent, with 9% requiring a urinary diversion. Many patients did not achieve maximum benefit until 9 months post-operatively. Surgery had no statistically significant effect on any urodynamic parameter and post-operative complications were common. The operation was performed in either the coronal (19) or the sagittal plane (26); this did not influence results. In general, surgery was found to be technically simpler in the sagittal group and it is recommended that this becomes the standard procedure. We feel that this operation involves major surgery and should only be offered with reluctance. 
A placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter: a multicenter study. The safety and efficacy of a 10- to 15-mg/h continuous infusion of intravenous diltiazem were evaluated in 47 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter who first responded to 20 mg or 20 mg followed by one or more 25-mg bolus doses of open label intravenous diltiazem. Of the 47 patients, 44 responded to the bolus injection and were randomized under double-blind conditions to receive either a continuous infusion of intravenous diltiazem (10 to 15 mg/h) (23 patients) or placebo (21 patients) for up to 24 h. Seventeen (74%) of the 23 patients receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 h (p less than 0.001). Over 24 h, patients receiving diltiazem infusion lost response significantly more slowly than did those receiving placebo infusion (p less than 0.001). Nonresponders to the double-blind infusion were given an additional bolus injection of open label intravenous diltiazem and administered an open label 24-h intravenous diltiazem infusion. The overall proportion of patients maintaining a response to a 24-h infusion of intravenous diltiazem under double-blind or open label conditions combined was 83% (34 of 41). Efficacy of the 24-h infusion of intravenous diltiazem was similar in elderly versus young patients, those who did versus those who did not receive digoxin and those weighing less than 84 versus greater than or equal to 84 kg. However, intravenous diltiazem appeared to be more effective in atrial fibrillation than in atrial flutter. No significant untoward effects were noted. 
The impact of cigarette smoking on headache activity in headache patients. The present study was designed to explore the relationship between cigarette smoking and headache activity in a sample of patients presenting for treatment. Subjects completed various self-report measures and monitored headache activity four times per day over a 4-week period. Analyses revealed that smokers experienced greater weekly peak headache intensity, and reported higher levels of depression and general physical symptoms. Among smokers, nicotine content of the preferred brand was associated with mean headache index and weekly headache-free days, as well as depression and anxiety scores. Daily smoking rate and pack-year history were related to level of general physical symptoms only. Thus, both smoking status and the nicotine content of the preferred cigarette appear to adversely impact headache activity. Further, smokers who are more anxious or depressed may increase their headache activity via their preference for higher nicotine-content cigarettes. These results are discussed in the context of possible mechanisms underlying these effects, and implications for the clinical management of headache suffers who smoke. 
Case report: hepatic hydrothorax without ascites. Pleural effusion due to hepatic cirrhosis and ascites is well known. We describe three patients with right-sided hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites. The formation of pleural fluid in these patients is probably a result of fluid movement from peritoneal to pleural space across diaphragmatic defects before ascites can form. The differential diagnosis of a right-sided transudative pleural effusion in a patient with chronic liver disease with or without ascites includes congestive left ventricular failure and nephrotic syndrome. These diseases are usually ruled out with standard clinical tests. Patients with hepatic hydrothorax should be treated with fluid restriction and diuretics. Patients with severe symptoms due to refractory hepatic hydrothorax might benefit from pleural sclerosis and surgical closure of diaphragmatic defects. 
The role of chronic viral hepatitis in hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Although hepatocellular carcinoma is a relatively uncommon tumor in the United States, it is quite common in sub-Saharan Africa and the Far East, where most cases are associated with infection with the hepatitis B virus. We have studied 99 American patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection and compared these findings to those in a group of matched controls with other cancers. The two groups differed in proportion, with hepatitis B surface antigen in serum being significantly higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (7% vs. 0%, p = 0.009). Antibody to hepatitis C virus was also found more frequently in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (13% vs. 2%, p = 0.002). The relative risk for hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients was calculated to be 17.3 and for antibody to hepatitis C virus to be 7.3. The attributable fraction of cases related to the hepatitis B surface antigen carrier state was 6.7% and for patients infected with the hepatitis C virus was 11.4%. Approximately three quarters of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma did not have evidence of either hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus infection. These findings provide strong evidence that hepatitis C virus infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in the United States may even play a more important role than the hepatitis B virus. 
Selective amplification of periportal transitional cells precedes formation of hepatocellular carcinoma in SV40 large tag transgenic mice. In a major urinary protein (MUP)-promoter/simian virus 40 (SV40)Tag transgenic mouse line (MT-D2) the liver-directed, androgen-regulated transgene expression leads to synchronized pathology resulting in a stepwise progression to multiple hepatocellular carcinomas. SV40Tag-activated replication gives rise to two different preneoplastic alterations in hepatocytes, which are characterized in detail: 1) dysplasia and finally cell death in the original hepatocyte population and 2) amplification of periportal transitional hepatocytes leading to multifocal hyperplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma. Multifocal hyperplasia, most probably the equivalent of SV40Tag-immortalization, grows confluent and leads to hepatomegaly. SV40Tag-independent, secondary events are necessary for the tumor development from confluent hyperplasia. This allows further investigation of the steps involved in malignant transformation and progression during hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo. 
Abnormal responses to orthostatic testing in children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope. Syncope in the pediatric age group is a frequent event. Most often the cause is readily apparent--i.e., orthostatic hypotension or a vasovagal event. However, there are a large number of children with frequent recurrent unexplained syncope. Neither history, physical examination, nor standard testing reveals a cause. One hundred four consecutive patients were evaluated by orthostatic testing after standard methods found no cause for the recurrent syncope. Forty-seven (44%) of these 104 patients had syncope produced by orthostatic testing. Twenty-six of the 47 (55%) became syncopal within 5 minutes of testing initiation and 21 of the 47 (45%) after 5 to 11 minutes of testing. These patients had an average decrease of 81.5 mm Hg in blood pressure and a 25 beat/min decrease in heart rate. Of 12 control subjects, none lost consciousness with standing times as long as 14 minutes. Pacing was ineffective in preventing syncope, as two patients with a previously implanted normally functioning pacemaker had recurrent syncope clinically. Syncope was also induced by orthostatic testing, with the pacemaker showing a normal response with pacing as the patient became bradycardic. The syncopal event produced by orthostatic testing occurred with a downward blood pressure trend and a narrowing of the pulse pressure without a significant increase in heart rate. This was followed by a sudden drop in blood pressure and then by bradycardia. There is a group of children and adolescents with recurrent unexplained syncope due to abnormal orthostatic control mechanisms. Orthostatic testing appears helpful in identifying these patients. 
A prospective, randomized trial comparing combination half-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator and streptokinase with full-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator. Kentucky Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial (KAMIT) Group. BACKGROUND. The potential benefits of combination thrombolytic agents in the treatment of myocardial infarction remain uncertain. In a small pilot study, we demonstrated that combining half-dose tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) with streptokinase (SK) achieved a high rate of infarct vessel patency and a low rate of reocclusion at half the cost of full-dose t-PA. METHODS AND RESULTS. We designed a prospective trial in which 216 patients were randomized within 6 hours of myocardial infarction to receive either the combination of half-dose (50 mg) t-PA with streptokinase (1.5 MU) during 1 hour or to the conventional dose of t-PA (100 mg) during 3 hours. Acute patency was determined by angiography at 90 minutes, and angioplasty was reserved for failed thrombolysis. Heparin and aspirin regimens were maintained until follow-up catheterization at day 7. Acute patency was significantly greater after t-PA/SK (79%) than with t-PA alone (64%, p less than 0.05). After angioplasty for failed thrombolysis, acute patency increased to 96% in both groups. Marked depletion of serum fibrinogen levels occurred after t-PA/SK compared with t-PA alone at 4 hours (37 +/- 36 versus 199 +/- 66 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001) and persisted 24 hours after therapy (153 +/- 66 versus 252 +/- 75 mg/dl, p less than 0.0001). Reocclusion (3% versus 10%, p = 0.06), reinfarction (0% versus 4%, p less than 0.05), and need for emergency bypass surgery (1% versus 6%, p = 0.05) tended to be less in the t-PA/SK group. Greater myocardial salvage was apparent in the t-PA/SK group as assessed by infarct zone function at day 7 (-1.9 SD/chord versus -2.3 SD/chord after t-PA alone, p less than 0.05). In-hospital mortality (6% versus 4%) and serious bleeding (12% versus 11%) were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that a less expensive regimen of half-dose t-PA with SK yields superior 90-minute patency and left ventricular function and a trend toward reduced reocclusion compared with the conventional dose of t-PA. 
Pulmonary and urinary clearance of atrial natriuretic factor in acute congestive heart failure in dogs. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone of cardiac origin elevated in acute congestive heart failure (CHF), which is degraded by the enzyme neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP). This study was designed to investigate the pulmonary and urinary clearance of ANF before and after the initiation of acute experimental CHF in dogs, and to assess the contribution of enzymatic degradation to these clearances in CHF. This study demonstrated a significant clearance of plasma ANF across the pulmonary circulation at baseline, and a tendency for pulmonary clearance to decrease in CHF (1115 +/- 268 to 498 +/- 173 ml/min, NS). The pulmonary extraction of ANF present at baseline was not altered with acute CHF (36.0 +/- 7.8 to 34.9 +/- 12.1%, NS). NEP inhibition (NEPI) abolished both the clearance and extraction of plasma ANF across the lung in CHF. Similarly, significant urinary clearance of ANF was present at baseline, and in acute CHF the urinary clearance of ANF decreased (0.14 +/- 0.02 to 0.02 +/- 0.01 ml/min, P less than 0.05). NEPI prevented the decrease in the urinary clearance of ANF, and enhanced the renal response to endogenous ANF, independent of further increases in plasma ANF during CHF. This study supports an important role for NEP in the pulmonary and urinary metabolism of endogenous ANF during acute CHF. 
Acetazolamide or dexamethasone use versus placebo to prevent acute mountain sickness on Mount Rainier. Eighteen climbers actively ascended Mount Rainier (elevation 4,392 m) twice during a randomized, double-blind, concurrent, placebo-controlled, crossover trial comparing the use of acetazolamide, 250 mg, dexamethasone, 4 mg, and placebo every 8 hours as prophylaxis for acute mountain sickness. Each subject was randomly assigned to receive placebo during one ascent and one of the active medications during the other ascent. Assessment of acute mountain sickness was performed using the Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire and a clinical interview. At the summit or high point attained above base camp, the use of dexamethasone significantly reduced the incidence of acute mountain sickness and the severity of symptoms. Cerebral and respiratory symptom severity scores for subjects receiving dexamethasone (0.26 +/- 0.16 and 0.20 +/- 0.19, respectively) were significantly lower than similar scores for both acetazolamide (0.80 +/- 0.80 and 1.20 +/- 1.05; P = 0.25) and placebo (1.11 +/- 1.02 and 1.45 +/- 1.27; P = .025). Neither the use of dexamethasone nor that of acetazolamide measurably affected other physical or mental aspects. Compared with placebo, dexamethasone appears to be effective for prophylaxis of symptoms associated with acute mountain sickness accompanying rapid ascent. The precise role of dexamethasone for the prophylaxis of acute mountain sickness is not known, but it can be considered for persons without contraindications who are intolerant of acetazolamide, for whom acetazolamide is ineffective, or who must make forced, rapid ascent to high altitude for a short period of time with a guaranteed retreat route. 
New autonomic and sensory neuropathy with loss of adrenergic sympathetic function and sensory neuropeptides. A 30-year-old woman with longstanding dizziness was found to have a severe postural fall in blood pressure and a reduced skin axon-reflex flare response. Autonomic tests indicated selective impairment of adrenergic sympathetic function. Plasma noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, and dopamine beta hydroxylase were undetectable. Skin biopsy specimens showed loss of tyrosine hydroxylase and neuropeptide Y (markers of adrenergic sympathetic fibres) and of substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (sensory neuropeptides). A sural nerve biopsy specimen showed severe depletion of unmyelinated fibres. The constellation of losses were compatible with nerve growth factor (NGF) deprivation, which was confirmed on assay. This new syndrome may be explained by loss of trophic action of NGF. 
Cogan's syndrome complicated by lacunar brain infarcts. Cogan's syndrome, nonsyphilitic interstitial keratitis with vestibuloauditory dysfunction, is an uncommon disease of young adults, probably a manifestation of vasculitis. A 32 year old woman with this syndrome developed a thalamic syndrome with amnesia and dysphasia due to lacunar infarcts. 
Williams syndrome: masseter spasm during anaesthesia. A 4-year-old boy with Williams syndrome developed masseter spasm after halothane and suxamethonium. He did not develop malignant hyperthermia; the surgery was accomplished with a nontriggering anaesthetic and no further problems. 
Behavioral state-specific changes in human hippocampal theta activity. Although there has been extensive examination of the behavioral and physiologic correlates of hippocampal theta activity in animals, the human literature consists of a single case study. We investigated the differential effects of four behavioral states on human hippocampal theta activity in 16 epilepsy surgery patients. Behavioral conditions included resting eyes closed (RC), resting eyes open (RO), eyes open with auditory word activation (AW), and eyes open with visuospatial activation (VS). Hippocampal theta activity decreased during both RO and VS compared to both RC and AW. There were reciprocal changes in delta activity. Comparisons of RO to VS and of RC to AW were nonsignificant. The results demonstrate state-specific changes in human hippocampal theta and are consistent with the animal literature that relates hippocampal theta to sensorimotor integration and forebrain volitional mechanisms. 
Colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis. Influence of anatomical extent and age at onset on colitis-cancer interval. We have examined the age at onset of both ulcerative colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer in 100 patients seen at Mount Sinai Hospital between 1959 and 1988. There were 85 patients with extensive colitis and 15 with left sided colitis. There was a strong direct correlation between the age at onset of ulcerative colitis and age at diagnosis of cancer (p less than 0.0001); this correlation was found both in patients with extensive colitis (p less than 0.0001) and in those with left sided colitis (p less than 0.005). Patients with left sided colitis developed both their colitis and their cancers about a decade later than did those with extensive disease, but the mean duration of colitis before diagnosis of cancer was virtually the same (about 21 years) in both groups, irrespective of the age at onset of disease. 
Laser balloon angioplasty: clinical, angiographic and histologic results. Laser balloon angioplasty combines conventional coronary angioplasty with laser energy to transiently heat vascular tissue. Laser balloon angioplasty, was performed in 21 patients (aged 56 +/- 13 years), including 10 patients treated urgently after acute failure of conventional angioplasty and 11 patients treated with elective laser balloon angioplasty. Immediately after conventional angioplasty, laser doses (1 to 10 doses of 205 to 380 J each) were delivered during inflation of the laser balloon to a pressure of 4 atm. Seven (70%) of 10 patients with acute failure of conventional angioplasty were successfully treated with laser balloon angioplasty, but 3 (30%) were unsuccessfully treated with the laser procedure and required emergency coronary artery bypass surgery. In all three failures, the 3 mm laser balloon angioplasty catheter was not the optimal size for the vessel. In the 11 patients treated with elective laser balloon angioplasty (reference diameter 2.94 +/- 0.22 mm), the minimal luminal diameter increased from 0.45 +/- 0.25 to 1.85 +/- 0.46 mm after conventional angioplasty and to 2.44 +/- 0.29 mm after laser balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). This corresponded to a decrease in diameter stenosis from 84 +/- 9% before to 35 +/- 16% after conventional angioplasty and to 15 +/- 10% after laser balloon angioplasty (p less than 0.001). There were no instances of myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass surgery or death and no acute complications related to delivery of laser energy in this group. Follow-up coronary angiography was performed 5.5 +/- 1.1 months after laser balloon angioplasty in 18 patients discharged from the hospital after a successful procedure. Ten patients (56%) had angiographic restenosis, defined as recurrent diameter stenosis greater than 50%. Six patients were subsequently treated by directional coronary atherectomy, which revealed intimal proliferation indistinguishable from that in patients with restenosis after conventional angioplasty. In conclusion, laser balloon angioplasty may be effective in sealing severe coronary dissections and reversing abrupt closure associated with failed conventional angioplasty. After uncomplicated conventional angioplasty, laser balloon angioplasty improves immediate luminal dimensions, but restenosis appears to be mediated by intimal hyperplasia, similar to that seen after conventional angioplasty. 
Coronary artery disease in blacks: past perspectives and current overview. It is difficult to draw strong conclusions from the available data. One must simply accept the fact that vital statistics show that cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among black Americans. Health care providers, policymakers, and funding agencies should use this information to develop preventive and therapeutic strategies to conquer this dreadful disease. 
Clinicopathologic features and prognostic significance of duodenal invasion in patients with distal gastric carcinoma. Clinicopathologic features and prognostic significance of duodenal invasion were studied in a retrospective study on 593 patients who underwent gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma in the antrum. The patients were grouped into three, according to the histologic extent of duodenal invasion: Group A (80 patients), obvious invasion beyond the pyloric ring; Group B (61 patients), invasion up to the pyloric ring; and Group C (452 patients), no evidence of duodenal invasion. Five-year survival rates in Groups A, B, and C were 7.9%, 31.6%, and 57.6%, respectively (P less than 0.001). Cox's regression analysis showed that duodenal invasion is an independent prognostic factor in cases of a gastric antrum carcinoma. Gastric cancer with duodenal invasion (Groups A and B) most often was infiltrative and the incidence of serosal invasion, lymphatic and vascular invasion, and lymph node metastasis was high. Duodenal invasion was direct through submucosal or subserosal layers or through submucosal lymphatics. 
Observations on the Kveim reaction using an animal model of granulomatous bowel disease. Striking differences were observed between the visceral and cutaneous responses after tests with validated Kveim and normal spleen suspensions in a guinea pig model of granulomatous bowel disease. Five of six animals sensitised with BCG showed positive responses at the ileal Kveim test site whereas all six had negative cutaneous Kveim tests. Conversely, two of six animals sensitised with irradiated Mycobacterium leprae showed positive cutaneous Kveim tests and only one a positive response in the ascending colon. All six showed negative responses at the ileal Kveim test site. No positive visceral or cutaneous responses were observed in either group of animals after tests with normal spleen suspension. These findings are discussed in relation to the positive Kveim responses previously reported among patients with Crohn's disease, tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy, and among seemingly healthy BCG vaccinated subjects. The findings provide further evidence in support of a possible mycobacterial aetiology for sarcoidosis and Crohn's disease. 
Spinal cord ischemia after resection of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms: MR findings in 24 patients. MR images of the thoracic spinal cord were made in 24 patients who developed signs and symptoms of spinal cord ischemia or infarction following surgery for a thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm. Findings consisted primarily of four different patterns of signal abnormalities in the distribution of the anterior spinal artery. These abnormalities were identified as types A-D, depending on the degree of involvement of the gray matter and surrounding white matter. We found good correlation between the distribution of the signal abnormalities in the cord, the severity of the neurologic deficits, and the clinical outcome. MR is the imaging method of choice for diagnosing spinal cord ischemia or infarction. A thorough knowledge of the spinal cord arterial territories is crucial for characterizing ischemic MR signal abnormalities and for differentiating them from other causes of myelopathy. 
Atypical myxoma. We report the case of a 38-year-old woman with a large thin-walled cystic mass (6 x 5 x 4.5 cm) filled with arterial blood in the right atrium. The cystic mass with blood content was clearly delineated by transesophageal cross-sectional echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the heart. At operation, a silver-whitish, smooth surfaced cystic mass was found attached to the free wall of the right atrium between the superior vena cava and the right atrial appendage with a broad base. Microscopically, the wall of the cyst was composed of stellate mesenchymal cells embedded within a myxoid matrix which was proved by alcian blue stain. To our knowledge, this type of cardiac myxoma has not been previously reported. 
Investigation of early surface delamination observed in retrieved heat-pressed tibial inserts. The objective was to examine possible reasons for delamination observed in tibial inserts of the porous-coated anatomic (PCA) knee replacement. To date, 33 PCA inserts have been forwarded to the authors' labs. Of these 33, 52% showed severe delamination within four years of implantation. Visual, structural, and mechanical analyses were conducted and data compared on the heat-pressed PCA type and the common machined inserts. Twenty inserts of the two different types were examined. Visual data using polarized light microscopy showed the presence of a surface layer separated from the middle region of the heat-pressed inserts by a line of demarcation 250-580 microns beneath the articulating surface. This anomaly was not observed in machined inserts. Structural analysis showed the new heat-pressed inserts had increased crystallinity in the surface layer when compared to new machined inserts. The retrieved heat-pressed inserts showed increased crystallinity in the surface and middle regions. There was a slight increase in surface crystallinity in the retrieved machined inserts. Microhardness data showed that there was an increased hardness associated with the crystallinity seen on the heat-pressed inserts. Orthopedic surgeons should be aware of early delamination and surface failure in heat-pressed inserts. 
Failure to deliver hepatitis B vaccine: confessions from a genitourinary medicine clinic. OBJECTIVE--To audit hepatitis B immunisation of homosexual or bisexual men in a genitourinary medicine clinic. DESIGN--Retrospective case note review of all homosexual and bisexual men presenting to a genitourinary clinic as new patients during 12 months in 1988 and follow up review of notes to May 1990. SETTING--One department of genitourinary medicine, Middlesex Hospital. PATIENTS--758 homosexual or bisexual men, of whom 207 started a course of hepatitis B vaccine in 1988. Case notes were unavailable for one patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The proportion of patients screened for hepatitis B virus markers, the proportion of susceptible patients immunised, the proportion completing the vaccine course, and the proportion rendered immune. RESULTS--25 men had been previously tested for hepatitis markers; of the 732 not previously tested, 440 (60.1%) were screened for hepatitis B markers. 207 (69%) of the 300 patients without hepatitis B serological markers started the vaccine course, and 141 (68%) completed it, with 75 (84%) of the 89 tested after immunisation being immune. An estimated 24% of susceptible new patients were rendered immune as a result of the immunisation policy. Patients who presented with a further episode of a sexually transmitted disease were more likely to have been screened (25% v 12%, p less than 0.0001) and immunised (31% v 18% p = 0.02); those known or found to be positive for HIV antibody were more likely to have been screened (23% v 14%, p = 0.047) but less likely to have been immunised (6% v 17%, p = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS--The major failure was that in not screening; failure to immunise patients found to be susceptible and failure of compliance with the vaccine course contributed. Non-response to the vaccine was of minor importance. Improvements in vaccine delivery are required. IMPLICATIONS--Other providers should be encouraged to review their performance. 
Gastroesophageal reflux disease as a cause of chest pain. Patients with recurrent chest pain free of significant coronary artery disease account for 10% to 30% of patients undergoing coronary angiography. Recent studies suggest that gastroesophageal reflux disease may be very common in these patients. The cause of this chest pain seems to be related primarily to an acid-sensitive mucosa regardless of the presence of esophagitis. Unfortunately, a careful history will not distinguish chest pain arising from a cardiac versus an esophageal source. Therefore, all patients must undergo a thorough cardiac evaluation before assuming that acid reflux is the cause of their complaints. Initial gastroenterology evaluation will usually include upper GI endoscopy or barium studies, possibly with acid perfusion (Bernstein) testing, or both. However, the more sensitive and specific test for acid-related disease is prolonged esophageal pH monitoring. This study quantifies the amount of acid reflux but, more importantly, identifies the relationship between chest pain and acid reflux episodes. Patients should be studied in the outpatient setting with emphasis placed on performing activities that replicate their chest pain. Although we presume that acid-induced chest pain responds as well as heartburn to vigorous antireflux regimens, there are few studies to address this issue. Nevertheless, I have had great success in treating these patients with either high-dose H2 blockers or omeprazole therapy. 
The effects of experimenter gender on pain report in male and female subjects. An experiment was conducted that investigated the effect of experimenter gender on the report of pain of male and female subjects. In order to evoke gender-related motives, experimenters were selected for their attractiveness. Subjects were asked to rate cold pressor pain in front of either a male or female experimenter. The results indicated that males reported significantly less pain in front of a female experimenter than a male experimenter. The difference in female subjects was not significant although they tended to report higher pain to the male experimenter. 
Breast cancer in elderly women: a Cancer Research Campaign trial comparing treatment with tamoxifen and optimal surgery with tamoxifen alone. The Elderly Breast Cancer Working Party. Three hundred and eighty-one women with operable breast cancer aged over 70 years were randomly allocated to 40 mg tamoxifen daily and optimal surgery or to tamoxifen alone. At a median follow-up of 34 months there was no demonstrable difference in survival rate or in quality of life between the two treatment groups. More patients treated with tamoxifen alone had a subsequent change of management and this was usually an operation for local treatment failure. This progression to surgery has not been shown to be disadvantageous and the study will continue. Informed consent for randomization was difficult to obtain, leading to the exclusion of eligible patients, and it is therefore proposed to include non-randomized patients in a total cohort study. 
Pain causes in 200 patients referred to a multidisciplinary cancer pain clinic. Causes of pain were analysed in 200 patients referred to a specialized cancer pain clinic. Pain caused by tumour growth was found in 158 patients, pain secondary to cancer or its treatment in 116 patients and pain unrelated to cancer in 33 patients. Visceral involvement (74 cases), bone metastases (68 cases), soft tissue invasion (56 cases) and nerve/plexus pressure or infiltration (39 cases) were the most frequent causes of pain due to tumour growth. Myogenic pain (68 cases) was the most frequent cause of secondary pain. The patients presented with a multitude of different combinations of causes of pain, the majority having at least two separate causes. Since pain treatment in cancer patients should be determined by its aetiology, a detailed analysis of the pain condition in each patient should form the basis for a rational therapy. 
Staging and follow-up of primary gastric lymphoma by endoscopic ultrasonography. The usefulness of endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was assessed for diagnosing the depth of invasion in the gastric wall, the infiltration to the adjacent organs, and detecting regional lymph node involvement in primary gastric lymphoma. EUS was performed in 11 patients with primary gastric lymphoma who subsequently underwent gastrectomy with lymph node dissection, as well as chemotherapy in some cases. EUS findings showed a good correlation with the histopathology of the resected specimens. An accurate diagnosis of the depth of invasion into the gastric wall was made in 10 of 11 patients using the same T grade of the 1987 TNM system for gastric carcinoma. EUS also clearly visualized the reduction of depth of tumor invasion in two patients who underwent chemotherapy. Perigastric lymph node involvement could be detected accurately in nine of 11 patients. In conclusion, EUS is an excellent and sensitive diagnostic modality for the preoperative staging and follow-up of primary gastric lymphoma. 
Methylmercury blocks N- and L-type Ca++ channels in nerve growth factor-differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells. Effects of methylmercury (MeHg) on whole-cell Ba++ currents in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were examined. Based on biophysical characteristics and sensitivity to omega-conotoxin GVIA and dihydropyridine agonists and antagonists, voltage-activated Ba++ currents (IBa) in PC12 cells were mediated by N- and L-type Ca++ channels. Addition of MeHg (10 microM) to the extracellular solution caused a rapid and complete block of current carried by 20 mM Ba++. The rate of block of IBa by MeHg increased in a concentration-dependent manner between 1 and 20 microM. Increasing the frequency of stimulation from 0.1 to 0.4 Hz facilitated block of IBa by MeHg. A 2-min application of 10 microM MeHg in the absence of stimulation also reduced IBa by approximately 80%. Thus, block of IBa by MeHg is not state-dependent. Additionally, MeHg blocked IBa when the membrane holding potential was -40, -70 and -90 mV, indicating that both N- and L-type Ca++ channels are blocked by MeHg. Block of IBa by MeHg was voltage-dependent at a membrane holding potential of -40 mV, but not at holding potentials of -70 and -90 mV. Decreasing the extracellular concentration of Ba++ ([Ba++]e) from 20 mM to 10 mM increased the magnitude of block by MeHg from 45.6 to 77.3%. Increasing [Ba++]e to 30 mM caused no further antagonism of block. Block of IBa by MeHg was not reversed by washing with MeHg-free solution. The ionic permeability of PC12 cell Ca++ channels was Ca++ = Sr++ greater than Ba++. In the presence of MeHg, all three divalent cations were equally permeant. 
Percutaneous coronary angioscopy in patients with restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioscopy with a flexible steerable microangioscope was performed in five patients undergoing repeat angioplasty. Recurrent lesions were assessed by angioscopy before and after the angioplasty procedure. The most common surface morphology observed in these restenosis lesions was that of white unpigmented lesions consistent with the proliferation of fibrous tissue. Also noted during angioscopy was the presence or absence of thrombus or dissection in association with the lesions either before or after angioplasty. Filmy wisps of tissue, presumably intimal flaps, were commonly visualized after angioplasty. There were no complications related to angioscopy or angioplasty in these patients. The surface morphology of restenosis lesions appears to be different from that of primary atherosclerotic lesions. The lesions in these five patients with restenosis were generally white and fibrotic in appearance, as opposed to the pigmented yellow to yellow-brown lesions commonly seen in undilated atherosclerotic lesions. It was also noted that the presence of intracoronary thrombus was strongly associated with the clinical syndrome of unstable angina. These findings support the hypothesis that restenosis lesions are the result of a reparative process consisting of smooth muscle cell proliferation and fibrosis. 
Abnormal esophageal transit in patients with typical reflux symptoms but normal endoscopic and pH profiles. There is a small, well-known cohort of patients who, despite classic reflux symptoms, have a normal esophageal pH profile and endoscopic picture. The treatment of these patients has proved problematic. In an attempt at determining the pathophysiology of this subgroup, we investigated the esophageal transit, using the radiolabeled solid bolus esophageal egg transit technique, in 58 such patients: 25 males, 33 females, mean age 39.5 years (range: 13 to 65 years). The egg transit was normal in 31 (53.4%) patients. In the remaining 27 (46.6%) patients, the condensed image analysis showed the following specific abnormal transit patterns: "step" delay pattern, demonstrating segmental hold-up in mid- or distal esophagus in 16 (59.3%); nonspecific delay in 6 (22.2%); oscillatory pattern in 3 (11.1%); and total nonclearance during the study period (4 minutes) in 2 (7.4%) patients. The patients with abnormal transit patterns had demographic parameters and symptom scores similar to those found in patients with normal transit. This study shows that almost 50% of patients with reflux symptoms and negative pH and endoscopy have abnormal esophageal transit, and almost two thirds of these patients display segmental transit delay in the lower half of the esophagus. The effect on symptomatology by prokinetic agents in the patient subgroup needs evaluation. 
The yield of barium enema in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair or abdominal hysterectomy. It is the practice of some gynecologists and general surgeons to preoperatively evaluate the colon with a barium enema (BE) examination to exclude potential intestinal involvement or coexistent disease in patients undergoing pelvic or hernia operations. This practice appears to be based on anecdotal data with few studies specifically evaluating its usefulness. We retrospectively evaluated the records of 190 patients at William Beaumont Army Medical Center during 1986 to 1987 who received a preoperative BE prior to total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) or inguinal hernia repair (IHR). The tumor registry charts of 59 patients diagnosed with carcinoma of the colon and rectum during the same period were also cross-checked to determine if any were detected during preoperative evaluation for TAH or IHR. BE findings were considered significant if they altered surgical management or asymptomatic carcinoma was detected. Of 86 patients screened before TAH by BE, eight had abnormal findings with subsequent colonoscopy revealing four with adenomatous polyps, one of which required surgical resection. Of 104 patients screened before IHR by BE, 15 had abnormal findings with subsequent colonoscopy revealing five patients with adenomatous polyps and two with adenocarcinoma. Screening preoperative BE had a low yield of clinically significant findings, which was even lower in the subgroup with carcinoma. There was no apparent relationship between findings and age in our study. Our results suggest that the use of routine preoperative BE has a low yield and should be performed only if clinical symptoms or findings suggest a need for this study. 
Microsurgical free-tissue transfer in the elderly patient. During the 5-year period from July of 1984 to July of 1989, we performed 94 free-tissue transfers in 92 patients over the age of 50 whom we arbitrarily defined as "elderly." There were 32 patients in the age range between 50 and 59 years, 40 patients aged between 60 and 69 years, and 20 patients aged between 70 and 79 years. Seventy-one flaps were utilized for head and neck reconstruction, and 23 flaps were used in reconstruction of the trunk and extremities. There was 1 total flap loss, for a flap viability rate of 99 percent (93 of 94). Postoperative complications were classified into surgical (technical) and medical categories. There were 14 major surgical complications (15 percent) and 13 significant postoperative medical problems (14 percent). The majority of these complications occurred in head and neck cancer patients in the age group between 60 and 69 years, who had significant underlying medical problems and were preoperatively classified as ASA 3. There were 5 postoperative deaths, for a mortality rate of 5.4 percent (5 of 92 patients). 
Visual outcome in pseudophakic eyes with clinical cystoid macular edema. Thirty-nine eyes with clinical cystoid macular edema (CME) following extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation were reviewed retrospectively. Chronic CME, defined as clinically symptomatic CME persisting more than 6 months, developed in 14 of the 39 eyes (36%): in 5 of the 7 (71%) eyes in which vitreous loss occurred and anterior chamber IOLs were implanted; and in 9 of 32 (28%) eyes in which no complications occurred and posterior chamber IOLs were implanted. The mean duration between diagnosis and last follow-up visit was 34 months. Only 4 of the 14 eyes (29%) with chronic CME achieved a visual acuity better than 20/40. Vitreous loss did not affect long-term visual prognosis. 
Interpretation of cardiac pathophysiology from pressure waveform analysis: the left-sided V wave [clinical conference] The left-sided V wave is dependent on both left atrial and ventricular pressure/volume filling relationship. The cardiac rhythm and timing of atrial systole also influences the V wave. The morphology of the V wave can reflect the severity of mitral regurgitation with stenosis, but valve areas in this setting may be better assessed by a pressure half-time method. Finally, as queried in our first patient example, V wave alternans is a reflection of left ventricular pressure alternans in a failing heart. Other signs of poor left ventricular function in Figure 1 also included an elevated minimal diastolic pressure and markedly elevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure. Hemodynamic findings of poor left ventricular function will be addressed in detail in a later "Rounds.". 
Fever in adult onset Still's disease. Response to methotrexate. Four patients who fulfilled criteria for adult onset Still's disease were treated sequentially with increasing doses of acetylsalicylic acid, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) and prednisone to control their fever and systemic manifestations. Persistence of the fever led us to treat them with small doses of methotrexate (MTX) with excellent response. Low dose MTX should be considered in patients unresponsive to antiinflammatory drugs before using high doses of prednisone. 
Selegiline: initial or adjunctive therapy of Parkinson's disease? Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurologic motor disorder. Currently, levodopa/carbidopa is the standard mode of therapy for PD; however, it does not prevent progression of the disease. Selegiline (also known as deprenyl), is a selective irreversible monoamine oxidase type B inhibitor virtually devoid of the tyramine reaction at the recommended dosage of 10 mg/d. It is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the adjunctive use in the management of patients with PD who are receiving levodopa/carbidopa and exhibit a "wearing off" effect of levodopa. Numerous clinical trials have been conducted evaluating selegiline's role in the treatment of PD. Preliminary evidence from the DATATOP trial suggests that selegiline may slow the progression of PD when used as initial therapy. However, final results of this trial and additional long-term controlled trials comparing selegiline to levodopa and placebo groups are necessary to further clarify selegiline's role in the treatment of PD. 
Fluoroscopic guidance in transseptal catheterization for percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy. A percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) was attempted on 190 patients with fluoroscopic guidance of atrial septal puncture for transseptal catheterization; in 3 cases, the procedure could not be performed. The left atrium was always reached on the first attempt, when the relationship of the Brockenbrough needle to the aortic catheter was previously observed in 3 fluoroscopic views: anteroposterior, 45 degrees right anterior oblique, and lateral. The atrial septal puncture site was located immediately below the aortic valve level, probably in the fossa ovalis, for the first 80 patients, and at mid distance between the aortic valve level and the diaphragm for the last 110. Hemodynamic data were similar in both groups. Fluoroscopic guidance for atrial septal puncture seemed capital for patients with scoliosis or in whom a vascular distortion (e.g., advanced pregnancy, right inferior vena cava absence) prevented a perfect parallelism between the needle curve and the needle outer index. 
Persistence of Theiler's virus infection following promotion of central nervous system remyelination. Chronic infection of SJL/J mice with the Daniel's strain of Theiler's virus develop primary demyelination, viral persistence but minimal central nervous system (CNS)-type remyelination. In contrast, treatment of virus-infected mice with sera or immunoglobulin G (IgG) from mice immunized with homogenized spinal cord (SCH) emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant promotes CNS remyelination. We measured levels of infectious virus, virus antigen and virus-specific antibody to determine if treatments which promote CNS remyelination are able to modulate infection. Levels of virus-specific antibody were higher in mice treated with SCH/IgG than control treatment groups and correlated positively with extent of remyelination. Although number of virus antigen-positive cells in spinal cord was less in mice treated with SCH/IgG than mice treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/IgG, there was only a slight negative correlation with extent of remyelination by regression analysis. Titers of infectious virus isolated three to six months following infection were not different among treatment groups. Even though treatment of mice with SCH/IgG reduced number of virus antigen-positive cells and enhanced levels of virus-specific antibody, CNS remyelination can occur despite presence of infectious virus. 
Vertebral alterations in Scheuermann's kyphosis. In a cadaver-derived skeletal collection of 1,384 thoracolumbar spinal columns, 103 (7.4%) individuals with vertebral changes of Scheuermann's kyphosis were identified. Anterior extension of the vertebral specimens was noted in 94% of affected specimens. No evidence of osteoporosis was noted by single-photon absorptiometric analysis in the affected sample compared with a normal control group. Biopsy specimens from two immature patients obtained at surgery suggested disorganized endochondral ossification similar to that noted in Blount's disease. It was concluded that increased pressure on the anterior margin of the centrum is responsible for histologic and morphologic changes of Scheurermann's kyphosis. 
Left ventricular myocardial edema. Lymph flow, interstitial fibrosis, and cardiac function. We hypothesized that both acute and chronic accumulation of myocardial interstitial edema (extravascular fluid [EVF]) would compromise cardiac function. We also postulated that excess fluid within the myocardial interstitial space would potentiate interstitial fibrosis, thus further compromising function. Dogs were divided into three groups: 1) control, 2) chronic pulmonary hypertensive with right heart failure, and 3) chronic arterial hypertensive. The quantity of EVF, expressed as the unitless blood-free (wet weight-dry weight)/dry weight ratio, and interstitial fibrosis (collagen content) were determined and correlated with cardiac function at baseline and after acute elevation of coronary venous pressure and reduction of cardiac lymph flow. Control EVF was 2.90 +/- 0.20 (mean +/- SD), which increased to 3.45 +/- 0.16 after acute (3-hour) elevation of coronary sinus pressure. This EVF significantly compromised cardiac function. The EVF in chronically hypertensive dogs and in dogs with chronic right heart pressure elevations was 3.50 +/- 0.30 and 3.50 +/- 0.08, respectively. End-diastolic left ventricular interstitial fluid pressure increased from a control value of 14.9 +/- 3.1 (at EVF = 2.9) to 24.8 +/- 3.7 (at EVF = 3.5). An EVF of 3.5 produced approximately 30% reduction of the heart's ability to maintain cardiac output at a left atrial pressure of 15 mm Hg. The compromised function in these chronic models is exacerbated after acute elevation of coronary venous pressure and reduction of cardiac lymph flow. Collagen levels were elevated by at least 20% in the chronic hypertensive dogs and in the nonhypertrophied left ventricles of dogs with chronic right heart pressure elevation. 
Renal colic. Utility of the plain abdominal roentgenogram. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 85 consecutive symptomatic patients to evaluate the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of plain abdominal roentgenography (PAR) compared with clinical evaluation alone in diagnosis and treatment of renal colic. With a positive intravenous pyelogram and/or actual stone retrieval used as the gold standard, 72 patients had documented stones. The calculated sensitivity and specificity for PAR were 58% (95% confidence interval, 47% to 69%) and 69% (95% confidence interval, 44% to 94%), respectively. In this population with a stone prevalence of 85%, the positive predictive value of PAR was 91%. A clinical scoring system based on signs and symptoms fared as well as PAR (sensitivity, 73%; specificity, 46%; and positive predictive value, 88%). The strategy of clinical scoring followed by selective use of intravenous pyelography was more cost-effective than strategies using PAR. We conclude that the PAR has low sensitivity and specificity and improves the predictive value only marginally, and its routine use is not cost-effective. 
Sulphasalazine-induced reversible hypersensitivity pneumonitis and fatal fibrosing alveolitis: report of two cases. The cases of two patients with ulcerative colitis are described who developed pulmonary infiltrates during the early months of treatment with sulphasalazine. The first patient had a hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which was confirmed by challenge. Recovery was complete. The second patient developed a fibrosing alveolitis type reaction, with fatal outcome. 
Rearrangements of the tal-1 locus as clonal markers for T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Normal and aberrant immune receptor gene assembly each produce site-specific DNA rearrangements in leukemic lymphoblasts. In either case, these rearrangements provide useful clonal markers for the leukemias in question. In the t(1;14)(p34;q11) translocation associated with T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), the breakpoints on chromosome 1 interrupt the tal-1 gene. A site-specific deletion interrupts the same gene in an additional 26% of T-ALL. Thus, nearly one-third of these leukemias contain clustered rearrangements of the tal-1 locus. To test whether these rearrangements can serve as markers for residual disease, we monitored four patients with T-ALL; three of the leukemias contained a deleted (tald) and one a translocated (talt) tal-1 allele. These alleles were recognized by a sensitive amplification/hybridization assay. tald alleles were found in the blood of one patient during the 4th mo of treatment but not thereafter. Using a quantitative assay to measure the fraction of tald alleles in DNA extracts, we estimated that this month 4 sample contained 150 tald copies per 10(6) genome copies. The patient with t(1;14)(p34;q11) (talt) leukemia developed a positive assay during the 20th mo of treatment. By standard criteria, all four patients remain in complete remission 11-20 mo into treatment. We conclude that tal-1 rearrangements provide useful clonal markers for approximately 30% of T-ALLs. 
Idiopathic aldosteronism in pregnancy. This is the first reported case of the idiopathic type of primary aldosteronism in pregnancy. The severely hypertensive patient was unresponsive to treatment with high doses of four antihypertensive agents administered concurrently. A drastic improvement in blood pressure was noted within 24 hours of beginning enalapril maleate, although subsequent deterioration in fetal status led to delivery at 26 weeks' gestation. Alternatives to standard medical therapy may be necessary for this rare but potentially life-threatening disease during pregnancy. 
The economic burden of gallstone lithotripsy. Will cost determine its fate? Gallstone lithotripsy (LITHO) was performed on 52 patients who underwent 107 procedures. Two hundred sixty-seven gallstone patients were screened and 215 (81%) were excluded. Excessive stone burden and nonvisualization by oral cholecystogram (OCG) were the most common reasons for exclusion. The hospital course of 100 excluded patients who later underwent elective cholecystectomy was evaluated for length of hospital stay (2.3 days) and total cost of treatment ($3685.00). Successful fragmentation to less than 5 mm was achieved in 43 LITHO patients (83%). Five LITHO patients (10%) required conversion to operative management. Complications of LITHO included acute cholecystitis (1 of 52 patients) and biliary colic (17 of 52 patients, or 33%). Multiple procedures in one patient were common. Costs for LITHO were calculated in two ways: first the individual cost for each of the 52 candidates; second the cost for successful LITHO was calculated by excluding five patients who required operation as well as five patients (10%) who are predicted failures of LITHO. Including the preoperative evaluation, treatment, recovery room, and follow-up, the individual LITHO cost for 52 patients was $8275.00. If the same total expenditure is calculated after excluding patients who required operation and those predicted to fail, the cost per 'successful' LITHO procedure was $10,245. The cost of 1 year of bile acid therapy is $1949.00 or $2413.00 per 'successful' procedure. Follow-up costs were $1232.00 per patient or $1525.00 per 'successful' procedure. The added LITHO cost incurred by screening eventual noncandidates was $904.00 per successful procedure. The sum of these individual costs was $15,087.00 per success, as compared to $3685.00 for cholecystectomy. No allowance was made for cost of stone recurrence. Lithotripsy costs appear to be sufficiently high to render the procedure unlikely to emerge as the treatment of choice. 
Selective photothermolysis and removal of cutaneous vasculopathies and tattoos by pulsed laser. The evolution of the laser as a medical device has been a process of continued improvement. Research into increasing our understanding of the optical characteristics of skin has made it possible to concentrate not on the effects of any particular laser system, but on basic biologic and physical principles of laser-tissue interaction. The lasers available in the 1960s and 1970s offered few possibilities for modification. However, modern technology allows us to manipulate the physical characteristics of lasers and design them for specific therapeutic purposes. Selective photothermolysis relies on chromophore-specific absorption of a brief pulse of light to generate and confine heat to certain targets within the skin without nonspecific thermal damage to adjacent structures. Thermally mediated target alterations can be confined from the level of large multicellular tissue structures (e.g., blood vessels) to individual microscopic pigmented structures (e.g., tattoo pigment granules). The purpose of this report is to describe the current progress being made and to summarize the present theories for achieving increasing selective removal, without scarring or other skin textural changes, of cutaneous vasculopathies and tattoo pigment by pulsed laser. 
Ewing's sarcoma in children: twenty-five years of experience at the Instituto Portuges de Oncologia de Francisco Gentil (I.P.O.F.G.). Fifty children with Ewing's sarcoma were consecutively treated from 1962 to 1987 and retrospectively analyzed at the I.P.O.F.G. of Lisbon. At first diagnosis, 10 cases had distant metastases. The remaining 40 patients had clinically localized disease, and different protocols were followed over the years. The best results were obtained with chemotherapy and radiotherapy with or without surgery; and for these children the two-year survival rate was 42.8% vs. 8.3% for the group of patients submitted to local treatment alone. Besides the treatment modality, other factors influenced the prognosis, such as inflammatory signs, sex, tumor volume, and tumor site as well as evidence of distant metastases. 
Repair of aortic coarctation in infants. Fifty-three consecutive infants younger than 2 years underwent coarctation repair. A recoarctation occurred in 11 infants (21%). To determine variables associated with recoarctation, we entered preoperative and operative data into a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Patient weight was an incremental risk factor for recoarctation instead of age, in contrast to previously published studies. Furthermore, the residual gradient after the operation was a strong incremental risk factor. This risk factor was even more significant when expressed as a ratio of the systolic arm pressure, which takes background hemodynamics into account. Because weight is a more significant risk factor than age, we conclude that deferring operation is indicated only when the infant gains weight. Furthermore, a residual gradient is more important in the hemodynamic setting of a lower systolic arm pressure. 
Pathophysiology of upper airway closure during sleep. While the upper airway normally remains patent during quiet breathing in wakefulness and sleep, patients with obstructive sleep apnea have repetitive periods of upper airway closure during sleep. The upper airway closures usually occur at various sites in the pharynx. The patency of the potentially collapsible pharynx during inspiration depends on the balance between subatmospheric pressure in the pharyngeal airway and airway dilating forces generated by pharyngeal muscles. The pressure required to collapse the upper airway in the absence of upper airway muscle activity, ie, closing pressure, is normally subatmospheric. In obstructive sleep apnea, positive pressures are required to maintain patency of the passive upper airway. The pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying upper airway closures during sleep form the basis for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. In general, these treatment modalities attempt to (1) raise the pharyngeal pressure above the closing pressure, (2) decrease the closing pressure, or (3) increase upper airway muscle activity. 
Clinical characteristics and surgical management of vascular complications in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization: interventional versus diagnostic procedures. The purpose of this report is to define the clinical characteristics and outcome of surgical management of vascular complications after interventional cardiac catheterization and to contrast them to those after diagnostic cardiac catheterization. From October 1985 to December 1989, 101 patients were treated for 106 vascular complications after 1866 interventional and 5046 diagnostic cardiac catheterizations at the University of Michigan Medical Center. Interventional catheterizations resulted in 69 vascular complications in 64 patients (frequency 3.4%). The most common interventions included coronary angioplasty (34), of which 10 required percutaneous partial cardiopulmonary bypass, intraaortic balloon pump placement (14), and aortic valvuloplasty (11). Interventional catheter-related complications included hemorrhage (33), arterial thrombosis (18), pseudoaneurysm formation (12), catheter embolization (2), thromboembolism (2), as well as arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, and arterial dissection (1 each). Fifteen of these 69 patients (24%) had suffered acute myocardial infarction just before their catheterization. Surgical repair was performed under local anesthesia in 70% of patients. Major vascular reconstructions were required in 9% of patients. Three percent of the involved lower extremities had to be amputated because of complications occurring after arterial puncture. Eight percent of the patients incurring vascular complications after interventional procedures died after operation. Diagnostic catheterizations resulted in 37 vascular complications in 37 patients (frequency 0.7%). In contrast to diagnostic cardiac catheterization, vascular complications after interventional cardiac catheterization occurred more frequently, were most often due to hemorrhage at the vascular access site, and occurred in high-risk, critically ill patients. 
Significance of aberrant immunophenotypes in childhood acute lymphoid leukemia. Leukemic cells from 51 pediatric patients (younger than 18 years) diagnosed with acute lymphoid leukemia by standard morphologic and cytochemical methods were subjected to flow cytometric studies using a panel of monoclonal antibodies against T-cell (CD1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8), B-cell (CD10, 19, 20, 21), myeloid (CD13, 14, 15, 33), and HLA-DR antigens. Cases of "conventional" acute lymphoid leukemia (leukemic cells with a normal configuration of B-cell or T-cell differentiation antigens) were observed in 26 of 51 (51%) cases, whereas cases of "aberrant" acute lymphoid leukemia (cells with abnormal patterns of B-cell or T-cell antigens or with concomitant myeloid antigens) were noticed in 25 (49%) cases. Myeloid antigen-positive acute lymphoid leukemia was observed in the leukemic cells of eight (16%) individuals. No significant differences were observed between conventional and aberrant ALL in the distribution of sex, age, leukocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, platelet count, blast count, French-American-British (FAB) type, lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, rate or duration of remission, or survival. When only myeloid antigen-positive cases were compared with myeloid antigen negative-cases, no significant correlations were observed except for duration of first remission (myeloid antigen positive, 26+ +/- 22 months; myeloid antigen negative, 40+ +/- 18 months; P less than 0.001), and duration of survival (myeloid antigen positive, 27+ +/- 24 months; myeloid antigen negative, 62+ +/- 17 months; P = 0.001). These data suggest that pediatric patients with ALL blasts possessing myeloid antigens may represent a high-risk group for length of remission and survival. 
Long-term mortality after 5-year multifactorial primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases in middle-aged men OBJECTIVE. To investigate the long-term effects of multifactorial primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). DESIGN. The 5-year randomized, controlled trial was performed between 1974 and 1980. The subjects and their risk factors were reevaluated in 1985. Posttrial mortality follow-up was continued up to December 31, 1989. SETTING. Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, Finland, and Second Department of Medicine, University of Helsinki. PARTICIPANTS. In all, 3490 business executives born during 1919 through 1934 participated in health checkups in the late 1960s. In 1974, 1222 of these men who were clinically healthy, but with CVD risk factors, were entered into the primary prevention trial; 612 were randomized to an intervention and 610 to a control group. INTERVENTIONS. During the 5-year trial, the subjects of the intervention group visited the investigators every fourth month. They were treated with intensive dietetic-hygienic measures and frequently with hypolipidemic (mainly clofibrate and/or probucol) and antihypertensive (mainly beta-blockers and/or diuretics) drugs. The control group was not treated by the investigators. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES. Total mortality, cardiac mortality, mortality due to other causes. RESULTS. Total coronary heart disease risk was reduced by 46% in the intervention group as compared with the control group at end-trial. During 5 posttrial years, the risk factor and medication differences were largely leveled off between the groups. Between 1974 and 1989 the total number of deaths was 67 in the intervention group and 46 in the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 2.08; P = .048); there were 34 and 14 cardiac deaths (RR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.31 to 4.46; P = .001), two and four deaths due to other CVD (not significant), 13 and 21 deaths due to cancer (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.22; P = .15), and 13 and one deaths due to violence (RR, 13.0; 95% CI, 1.70 to 98.7; P = .002), respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis of treatments in the intervention group did not explain the 15-year excess cardiac mortality. CONCLUSION. These unexpected results may not question multifactorial prevention as such but do support the need for research on the selection and interaction(s) of methods used in the primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. 
The nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway in Wilson's disease studied with positron emission tomography. Movement disorders, including Parkinsonism, are prominent features of neurological Wilson's disease (WD). This suggests there may be dysfunction of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway. To explore this possibility, five patients were studied using positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-6-fluorodopa (6FD), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We calculated striatal 6FD uptake rate constants by a graphical method and compared the results with those of 18 normal subjects. It was found that four patients with symptoms all had abnormally low 6FD uptake, and the one asymptomatic patient had normal uptake. PET evidence for nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction was present even after many years of penicillamine treatment. It is concluded that the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway is involved in neurological WD. 
Otoplasty: critical review of clinical results. Although it is generally believed that otoplasty provides uniformly gratifying results, thorough patient follow-up reviews are quite rare. Otoplasty surgery performed on 119 ears was retrospectively reviewed to assess the results of our cartilage-sparing technique. This method of otoplasty relies on a conchal set-back and suture transfixation technique to improve the antihelical contour. Auricular medialization averaged 10.3 mm. Over-correction is required, particularly in the superior pole, as loss of correction with healing was approximately 40% of the initial medialization. Revision surgery due to loss of correction was necessary for 6.6% of the ears initially operated on by the senior author. Patients who presented following cartilage-cutting procedures tended to have a higher rate of revision and persistent postoperative stigmata. Complications in general were few; however, mersilene suture extrusion occurred in 8% of ears. Only one of these required revision surgery for associated loss of correction. Despite these drawbacks, over 95% of patients achieved satisfactory results using cartilage-sparing otoplasty techniques. 
Dose-dependent inhibition of stretch-induced arrhythmias by gadolinium in isolated canine ventricles. Evidence for a unique mode of antiarrhythmic action. Transient diastolic dilatation of the isolated canine left ventricle predictably elicits arrhythmias. To test the hypothesis that such arrhythmias may be mediated by sarcolemmal stretch-activated channels, we attempted to inhibit stretch-induced arrhythmias with gadolinium (Gd3+), a potent stretch-activated channel blocker. In experiments with six isolated canine hearts, left ventricular volume was increased for 50 msec during early diastole and then returned to initial volume by a computerized servopump. The stretch volume was adjusted to yield a probability of eliciting a stretch-induced arrhythmia of 95 +/- 2% before treatment with Gd3+. When Gd3+ (1-10 microM) was administered, dose-dependent suppression of stretch-induced arrhythmias was observed. The probability of a stretch-induced arrhythmia was reduced to 13 +/- 10% (p less than 0.05) with 10 microM Gd3+. Washout of Gd3+ completely reversed this effect. Since Gd3+ is known to be a calcium channel antagonist, we compared the effect of Gd3+ on stretch-induced arrhythmias with that of verapamil and nifedipine. These calcium channel blockers produced no demonstrable inhibition of stretch-induced arrhythmias when administered at concentrations (1 microM) that substantially depressed left ventricular pressure development. Thus, our results indirectly implicate stretch-activated channels in the genesis of stretch-induced arrhythmias and provide preliminary evidence for a potential new mode of antiarrhythmic drug action--blockade of stretch-activated channels. 
Cytomegalovirus endomyocarditis in a transplanted heart. A case report with in situ hybridization. A 64-year-old man underwent cardiac transplantation for long-standing severe dilated cardiomyopathy. Postoperative complications included primary cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection with several episodes of moderate acute rejection and severe pneumonia. Six months after transplantation, an endomyocardial biopsy specimen revealed focal necrotizing myocarditis with intranuclear inclusions consistent with CMV. The patient subsequently developed fulminant pneumonia and died 7 months after transplantation. Postmortem examination revealed that the cause of death was acute necrotizing bronchopneumonia due to Staphylococcus aureus, with underlying CMV pneumonitis. The transplanted heart had left ventricular hypertrophy with multiple organizing myocardial infarcts, moderate coronary atherosclerosis, and organizing thrombi of the left atrium. Characteristic inclusions of CMV were identified, predominantly within endothelial cells, in the left coronary artery, left ventricular endocardium, and myocardium. With in situ hybridization, the presence of CMV was verified in the inclusions, as well as in many fibroblasts without inclusions. In situ hybridization is warranted in myocardial biopsy specimens when suspicious inclusions or infiltrates are present, to confirm CMV infection, so that appropriate therapy can be initiated. 
Role of ammonia in the induction of renal hypertrophy. Recent experiments from our laboratory have documented the importance of ammonia as a modulator of renal cell growth in vitro. Ammonia induces renal hypertrophy by increasing the rate of protein synthesis and decreasing the rate of protein degradation. These results have led to the hypothesis that an increase in renal ammoniagenesis contributes to renal growth in several seemingly unrelated clinical disorders. In chronic hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis, mitochondrial ammoniagenesis is stimulated directly. During protein loading, uninephrectomy, and diabetes mellitus, renal ammoniagenesis may be stimulated by an increase in single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR). 
Health implications of obesity. The health risks of obesity increase with its severity and reach significance at a weight greater than 20% above optimal, by using life insurance tables, or at a body mass index greater than 27. Risks include hypertension, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and, in some studies, high total-and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. There is an increased mortality from endometrial cancer in women and from colorectal cancer in men. Chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, sleep apnea, gout, and degenerative joint disease can occur with more severe obesity. The distribution of body fat is directly related to these health risks. Abdominal obesity is more dangerous than gluteal-femoral obesity because the amount of intraabdominal fat seems to determine much of the increased peril; therefore, risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes increase with abdominal obesity, even independently of total fat mass. 
CT-guided percutaneous transpedicular biopsy of the spine. Occasionally, vertebral body lesions are encountered that are ill suited to the standard posterolateral approach to biopsy. The authors used a transpedicular approach to spine biopsy in six such cases. The authors suggest that this approach be used when the location of the lesion does not allow easy access by means of the posterolateral approach. 
Otolaryngologic approach to the diagnosis and management of otitis media. Otitis media is a common childhood disease caused by multiple factors. Understanding the pathogenesis of otitis media is important in the diagnosis and management of it. The mode of therapy should be chosen depending on the type and stage of the disease. Treatment options available to an otolaryngologist include antibiotics, tympanocentesis, myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertions, adenoidectomy with or without tonsillectomy, exploratory tympanotomy, atympanoplasty, and mastoidectomy. 
Seizures in patients simultaneously receiving theophylline and imipenem or ciprofloxacin or metronidazole. Five patients had apparently drug-induced seizures while simultaneously receiving theophylline and either imipenem (three patients), ciprofloxacin (one patient), or ciprofloxacin and metronidazole (one patient). Seizures ceased upon reduction in dosage or discontinuation of the suspected offending agents. Imaging studies failed to reveal new structural lesions in the central nervous system in any patient, and only one had a history of neurologic disease. Although the exact mechanism for seizure induction cannot be determined from these cases, potential drug interactions exist, because theophylline, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin are all believed to increase excitation of the central nervous system by inhibition of gamma-aminobutyric acid binding to receptors. In addition, ciprofloxacin decreases the clearance of theophylline from the body, predisposing the patient to elevated theophylline levels. Physicians prescribing theophylline with imipenem, ciprofloxacin, or metronidazole should carefully monitor patients for indications for drug therapy, drug dosage, organ impairment affecting drug metabolism, and signs of toxicity. Seizures may accompany oral theophylline therapy, even at "therapeutic" serum theophylline concentrations. 
Statin immunolocalization in human brain tumors. Detection of noncycling cells using a novel marker of cell quiescence. Surgical specimens of 35 human brain tumors were examined with a novel monoclonal antibody, S-44, immunoreactive to statin, a nuclear protein specifically expressed in quiescent (noncycling) G0-phase cells. Benign tumors typically were statin positive with labeling indices (LI) between 22% and 96%: acoustic schwannomas (n = 3, mean = 29.9 +/- 19.4%); meningiomas (n = 4, mean = 59.0 +/- 15.1%); pituitary adenomas (n = 3, mean = 79.9 +/- 28.2%), and an epidermoid cyst (41.0%). By contrast, the statin LI of 18 of 24 (75%) malignant brain tumors was less than or equal to 2%: medulloblastomas (n = 7, mean = 0.3 +/- 0.2%); anaplastic astrocytomas (n = 3, mean = 1.6 +/- 2.7%); glioblastomas (n = 10, mean = 10.3 +/- 14.4%); metastatic carcinomas (n = 3, mean = 3.0 +/- 4.6); and a germinoma (0.2%). The vascular endothelium among diverse tumors typically was statin positive. All 21 tumors with a statin LI less than 10% were malignant, and all nine tumors with a statin LI greater than 40% were benign. The statin LI of benign tumors (n = 11, mean = 55.1 +/- 26.7%) was significantly higher than that of the malignant tumors (n = 24, mean = 5.2 +/- 10.5%, P less than 0.001). The absence of statin expression is a new way to determine the malignancy of human brain tumors. The statin LI may be useful to guide the prognosis and treatment of individual patients. The mechanisms that control statin expression are important in therapy seeking to shift the proliferating, cycling cells to the quiescent, G0 compartment. 
Can computer aided teaching packages improve clinical care in patients with acute abdominal pain? OBJECTIVE--To compare three methods of support for inexperienced staff in their diagnosis and management of patients with acute abdominal pain--namely, with (a) structured data collection forms, (b) real time computer aided decision support, and (c) computer based teaching packages. DESIGN--Prospective assessment of effects of methods of support on groups of doctors in one urban hospital and one rural hospital. SETTING--Accident and emergency department at Whipps Cross Hospital, London, and surgical wards of Airedale General Hospital, West Yorkshire. PATIENTS--Consecutive prospective series of all patients presenting to each hospital in specified time periods with acute abdominal pain; total patients in the various periods were 12,506. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diagnostic accuracy of participating doctors, admission rates of patients with non-specific abdominal pain, perforation rates in patients with appendicitis, negative laparotomy rates. RESULTS--Use of any one modality resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy and decision making performance. Use of structured forms plus computer feedback resulted in better performance than use of forms alone. Use of structured forms plus a computer teaching package gave results at least as good as those with direct feedback by computer. CONCLUSIONS--The results confirm earlier studies in suggesting that the use of computer aided decision support improves diagnostic and decision making performance when dealing with patients suffering from acute abdominal pain. That use of the computer for teaching gave results at least as good as with its use for direct feedback may be highly relevant for those who are apprehensive about the real time use of diagnostic computers in a clinical setting. 
Thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute limb ischaemia. Acute limb ischaemia poses a threat to both the limb and life of a patient. Until recently, attempted revascularization by thromboembolectomy or vascular reconstruction held the best chance of limb salvage. Thrombolytic techniques afford an alternative method of management for this condition and are effective in selected patients. Low-dose intra-arterial streptokinase is the most established method of thrombolysis, although the recently developed tissue plasminogen activator offers a promising alternative. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is not an easy option, being labour intensive and requiring close co-operation between surgeon and radiologist. Thrombolytic and surgical techniques are not mutually exclusive but are best used to complement each other. Ideally patients with acute limb ischaemia should be managed by surgeons with knowledge of, and access to, optimal current surgical and non-surgical techniques. 
A modified neoglottis procedure: update and analysis. In recent years, various techniques have been introduced for construction of an epithelium-lined shunt between the trachea and the esophagus or hypopharynx. We described a rigid neoglottis in a preliminary report of 12 cases in which the upper tracheal rings were used to construct the epithelium-lined tract. This study reports the cases of 22 additional patients and offers an in-depth analysis of additional demographics, complications, and long-term speech results that quantify the vocal characteristics of neoglottic speakers. Results indicate rapid postoperative speech rehabilitation in nearly all patients, good long-term speech results (mean followup, 52 months), and low morbidity. There was a low incidence of local recurrence and stenosis, and 26 of 34 patients had either no aspiration or occasional asymptomatic aspiration of small amounts of liquid. This modified neoglottis procedure should be considered for patients who need voice restoration after laryngectomy. 
Retinoic acid-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells is preceded by downregulation of autonomous generation of inositol lipid-derived second messengers. Inositol phosphates (InsPs) and diacyglycerol (DAG) are second messengers derived via the breakdown of inositol phospholipids, and which play important signalling roles in the regulation of proliferation of some cell types. We have studied the operation of this pathway during the early stages of retionic acid (RA)-induced granulocytic differentiation of HL60 myeloid leukemia cells. The autonomous breakdown of inositol lipids that occurred in HL60 cells labeled with [3H] inositol was completely abolished following 48 hours of RA treatment. The rate of influx of 45Ca2+ was also significantly decreased at 48 hours, consistent with the role of inositol lipid-derived second messengers in regulating Ca2+ entry into cells. The downregulation of inositol lipid metabolism clearly preceded the onset of reduced proliferation induced by RA treatment, and was therefore not a consequence of decreased cell growth. The generation of InsPs in RA-treated cells was reactivated by the fluoroaluminate ion, a direct activator of guanine nucleotide-binding protein(s) (G proteins) that regulate the inositol lipid signalling pathway. Subtle alterations to a regulatory mechanism may therefore mediate the RA-induced downregulation of this pathway. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that the autonomous generation of inositol lipid-derived second messengers may contribute to the continuous proliferation of HL60 cells, and that the RA-induced downregulation of this pathway may, in turn, play a role in signalling the cessation of proliferation that preceedes granulocytic differentiation. 
Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia in common variable immunodeficiency syndrome. A 26-year-old woman with common variable immunodeficiency syndrome (CVID) associated with frequent episodes of pneumonia underwent an open lung biopsy showing bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Following corticosteroid therapy, there were no further episodes of pneumonia. In addition, there was roentgenographic and gas exchange improvement. This is the first case of BOOP in association with CVID. An immunologic basis of BOOP is postulated. 
Orbital and eyelid involvement with Erdheim-Chester disease. A report of two cases. Erdheim-Chester disease is an idiopathic condition characterized by infiltration of the heart, lungs, retroperitoneum, bones, and other tissues by a fibrosing xanthogranulomatous process composed of xanthomatous histiocytes and Touton giant cells. This condition is often fatal, with death due to cardiomyopathy, severe lung disease, or chronic renal failure. Ocular findings with this potentially fatal disease are rare. We report the clinical and histopathologic findings in two cases of bilateral xanthelasmas and bilateral orbital infiltrates in association with Erdheim-Chester disease. The first patient was a 38-year-old man with cardiovascular and renal disease and severe retroperitoneal fibrosis. The massive orbital infiltration produced bilateral blindness. The second patient was a 77-year-old man with severe cardiovascular disease and retroperitoneal fibrosis. The diagnosis was confirmed in both patients with retroperitoneal and orbital biopsies. Both patients had the unusual occurrence of bilateral xanthelasmas with bilateral, diffuse orbital masses, eye findings that should alert the clinician to the possibility of this serious systemic disease. 
A community-based study of incidence, risk factors and outcome of transient ischaemic attacks in Umbria, Italy: the SEPIVAC study. The SEPIVAC study is a community-based epidemiological survey of incidence and outcome of transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) and strokes in the territory of the 6th Local Health Unit, Umbria, Italy, where 49,218 people live, from 1 September 1986 to 31 August 1989. All cases were registered with the study either by notification from general practitioners (GPs) or by a check of hospital admission within the study area and in the two hospitals of Perugia. There were 94 incident cases of TIAs (45 males, 49 females), thus giving a crude rate of 0.64 per 1000 per year [95% conficence intervals (CI) 0.52/0.78]. The rate adjusted to the European population is 0.42 (CI 0.33/0.54). Mean age was 69.4 years, and females were significantly older than males. The weighted relative risk for males was 1.19 (CI 0.79/1.79). Thirty-one patients were treated at home by their GPs. Females had hypertension more frequently than males, whereas males smoked more frequently; we did not find any other statistically significant difference in the distribution of risk factors. Twelve patients out of 58 who had CT had an infarct, and 29 out of 54 submitted to Doppler ultrasonography had carotid stenosis. At 1 month, 4 patients had suffered an ischaemic stroke, 1 of whom died. At 6 months, 3 further strokes and 2 further deaths (1 due to myocardial infarction) had occurred. 
Argon laser therapy for perianal Bowen's disease: a case report. Bowen's disease (intraepithelial squamous cell carcinoma) may occasionally occur in anal canal or perianal region. Surgical excision in this area may result in significant complications and a recurrence rate of 9-19%. A case of successful treatment of anal and perianal Bowen's disease using argon laser therapy is presented. No acute or chronic complications resulted from laser therapy. Twenty-eight months after the initial diagnosis the patient is disease free. Laser therapy also provides the potential for repeated treatment of recurrent lesions without significant patient discomfort or inconvenience. Argon laser therapy should be considered as a therapeutic option in the treatment of Bowen's disease. 
Adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer and incidence of new primary malignancies. Adjuvant chemotherapy is increasingly being given to patients with early breast cancer. Long-term follow-up studies suggest a higher frequency of secondary tumours, especially leukaemias, among women receiving such cytotoxic drugs. We studied the frequency of new primary malignancies in 1113 patients with early breast cancer who had been included in a randomised trial to compare chemotherapy as an adjunct to primary surgery with adjuvant locoregional radiotherapy. The estimated rate of new primary malignancies at ten years was significantly lower (p less than 0.0003) in the chemotherapy group (1%) than in the radiotherapy group (6%). The corresponding rate among 1986 patients treated with surgery alone was 5%. Our findings suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy in early breast cancer may protect against the development of new primary tumours in the first ten years of follow-up. 
Mucin-hypersecreting tumor of the pancreas with mucin extrusion through an enlarged papilla. Patient records, imaging films, macroscopic and microscopic features, and clinical follow-up data of seven Japanese patients with a mucin-hypersecreting tumor of the pancreas were reviewed. The mucin-hypersecreting tumor was defined as an enlarged major or minor papilla with a dilated orifice and visible mucin oozing on endoscopy. The series consisted of six men and one woman ranging from 47 to 79 yr old. The excretion of mucin through a patulous orifice of the enlarged ampulla of Vater was seen in six patients and of the enlarged minor papilla in the other patient with pancreas divisum. The main pancreatic duct was dilated in all patients. Amorphous mucin was seen in the dilated duct of five patients, and papillary nodules were present in two patients. Computed tomography and/or ultrasonography showed dilatation of the main pancreatic duct with multilocular cysts in six patients and with a solid tumor in the other patient. The tumor was located diffusely in the main pancreatic duct in one patient, whereas it was confined to branches in the head (four patients), body (one patient), or tail (one patient) of the pancreas in the six other patients. Histopathologic diagnosis was a cyst lined by hyperplastic mucus-secreting epithelium in one patient, mucinous cystadenoma in two, and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma in two. Five patients underwent resection and have survived for 1-46 months after the operation. The authors would like to emphasize this endoscopic syndrome because about half of mucin-hypersecreting tumors are malignant with a favorable prognosis. 
A site-specific deletion in mitochondrial DNA of Podospora is under the control of nuclear genes. In the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, the association of two nuclear genes inevitably leads to a "premature death" phenotype consisting of an early end of vegetative growth a few days after ascospore germination. Mycelia showing this phenotype contain a mitochondrial chromosome that always bears the same deletion. One of the break points is exactly at the 5' splice site of a particular mitochondrial intron, suggesting that the deletion event could result from molecular mechanisms also involved in intron mobility. One of the nuclear genes involved in triggering this site-specific event belongs to the mating-type minus haplotype; the other is a mutant allele of a gene encoding a cytosolic ribosomal protein. 
Does the addition of methylene blue to the sclerosant improve the accuracy of injections during variceal sclerotherapy? We evaluated the possibility that the addition of methylene blue to the sclerosant would improve the accuracy of intravariceal injections during endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. Four patients had eight sessions of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy with a sclerosant containing a combination of 3% sodium tetradecyl and 60% renograffin. For four sessions, 1 ml of methylene blue was added to 9 ml of sclerosant. The endoscopist judged each injection to be intravariceal or paravariceal. This was confirmed by fluoroscopy. There were 57 injections (28 with methylene blue, 29 without) in the eight sclerotherapy sessions. Intravariceal injections were confirmed fluoroscopically in 64.9% of injections (60.7% with methylene blue 69% without). The endoscopist correctly assessed intravariceal versus paravariceal injections 66.7% of the time (71.4% with methylene blue, 62% without). None of the differences approached statistical significance. The addition of methylene blue to the sclerosant does not improve the accuracy of intravariceal injections or the endoscopist's ability to recognize paravariceal injections during sclerotherapy of esophageal varices. 
Neonatal skin disorders. Skin disorders are commonly seen in the neonatal period. A recent survey of neonates demonstrated that almost every neonate had some skin lesion. The most common skin findings are desquamation, Epstein's pearls, sebaceous hyperplasia, milia, toxic erythema, salmon patch, hypertrichosis, and Mongolian spot. In addition to these common cutaneous findings, other disorders may exist and are discussed in this article. 
Continuous interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells for advanced cancer: a National Biotherapy Study Group trial. We conducted a multicenter, phase II trial of continuous-infusion recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Patients had advanced cancer, measurable disease, and a good performance level. Treatment included a 5-day continuous infusion of 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d of rIL-2 followed by 1 day of rest, 4 days of leukapheresis to collect cells for in vitro augmentation of cellular cytotoxicity, and 5 more days of rIL-2 infusion with reinfusion of LAK cells for 3 successive days. Therapy was repeated after 2 weeks. There were 117 patients enrolled: 63% were males, with a median age of 51 years. Eighty-two percent were managed in oncology units, and 18% were in intensive care units. Six patients died within 1 month of initiating therapy. In renal cell carcinoma, the response rate was one of 31 patients (3%), with a median survival of 10.7 months. In melanoma, the response rate was four of 33 patients (12%), with a median survival of 6.1 months. For all other histologies, response rate was three of 53 patients (5%), with a median survival of 7.4 months. All responders were asymptomatic when therapy was initiated. This trial confirms the feasibility of administering continuous rIL-2 and LAK cells outside the intensive care unit environment. Antitumor activity in melanoma was similar to that seen in multicenter trials of bolus rIL-2 and LAK cells. Activity in renal cell cancer was disappointing. 
Electrophysiologic testing. Any attempt to group clinical states according to those in which EPS is indicated and those in which EPS is contraindicated is difficult because of a considerable overlap. With this one reservation in mind, indications for EPS can be classified in three general groups. These include a group in which the procedure is helpful and frequently indicated, a group in which the procedure is occasionally of benefit but more often there is a difference of opinion among investigators as to its utility, and a third group in which EPS is rarely helpful, often contraindicated, and on occasion harmful. The clinical states and the utility of the EPS in each are summarized in Table 1. 
Development of cirrhosis after chronic type B hepatitis: a clinicopathologic and follow-up study of 46 HBeAg-positive asymptomatic patients. The rate of HBeAg clearance and the outcome were analyzed in 46 patients with asymptomatic chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection whose condition was followed for 1-4 yr (mean 2.4). Mean age was 32.5 yr (range 10-68), and 28 (61%) were males. All had chronic hepatitis, on biopsy, and were positive for HBcAg on hepatocytes. Alcoholics, homosexuals, drug abusers, immunocompromised patients, and those with advanced liver disease were excluded. During the follow-up, 25 patients (54%) cleared HBeAg and became seronegative for HBV-DNAp. The estimated annual rate of seroconversion was 26%. One patient cleared HBsAg. After seroconversion, 18 patients had no evidence of ongoing liver disease, proved by biopsy in eight and by clinical follow-up in 10 that refused biopsy. A second liver biopsy was available in 15 patients, and HBcAg was negative in all; histology was normal in eight, unchanged in one, and compatible with cirrhosis in six. All six had clinical and/or biochemical evidence of advanced liver disease. These were significantly older at the start of the study, and had chronic active hepatitis with bridging necrosis on initial biopsy. Early identification of patients with silent chronic HBV infection and high levels of viral replication for antiviral therapy could prevent transmission of the infection and stop progression to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Carcinoma of the prostate. Treating disease that has metastasized. Common manifestations of metastatic carcinoma of the prostate are bone pain, spinal cord compression, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Prostate-specific antigen represents a useful marker to monitor tumor progression and response to therapy. Until recently, no therapy was available to prolong survival in these patients. Now, the use of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide acetate [Lupron]) plus an antiandrogen (flutamide [Eulexin]) to provide total androgen blockade has demonstrated a 25% increase in survival time. 
Successful angioplasty of a chronically occluded saphenous vein graft using a prolonged urokinase infusion from the brachial route. A 68-year-old man who presented with unstable angina had had cardiac bypass surgery 12 years earlier and successful angioplasty of a native circumflex lesion 18 months previously. Repeat catheterization showed a widely patent angioplasty site but interval closure of a saphenous vein graft to a large marginal branch that was totally occluded proximally. A stress test revealed significant myocardial ischemia. Severe peripheral peripheral vascular disease with known bilateral iliac artery occlusions mandated a brachial approach. Because of his high risk for repeat cardiac surgery, it was elected to attempt saphenous graft angioplasty following a prolonged urokinase infusion. After an infusion of urokinase for 36 hr, antegrade flow was restored and angioplasty was carried out successfully on a discrete mid-graft legion. Subsequent stress testing showed resolution of the ischemia. There were no vascular complications. 
Synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion for support and salvage of ischemic myocardium during elective and failed angioplasty. To determine the safety and efficacy of synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion during brief periods of ischemia, 30 patients undergoing angioplasty of the left anterior descending coronary artery were studied. Each patient underwent a minimum of two angioplasty balloon inflations. Alternate dilations were supported with retroperfusion; the unsupported inflations served as the control inflations. Synchronized retroperfusion was performed by pumping autologous femoral artery blood by means of an electrocardiogram-triggered retroperfusion pump into the great cardiac vein through a triple lumen 8.5F balloon-tipped retroperfusion catheter inserted percutaneously from the right internal jugular vein. Clinical symptoms, hemodynamics and two-dimensional echocardiographic wall motion abnormalities were analyzed. Retroperfusion was associated with a lower angina severity score (0.8 +/- 1 vs. 1.2 +/- 1) and delay in onset of angina (53 +/- 31 vs. 37 +/- 14 s; p less than 0.05) compared with the control inflations. The magnitude of ST segment change was 0.11 +/- 0.14 mV with retroperfusion and 0.16 +/- 0.17 mV without treatment (p less than 0.05). The severity of left ventricular wall motion abnormality was also significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced with retroperfusion compared with control (0.7 +/- 1.4 [hypokinesia] vs. -0.3 +/- 1.6 [dyskinesia]). There were no significant changes in hemodynamics, except in mean coronary venous pressure, which increased from 8 +/- 3 mm Hg at baseline to 13 +/- 6 mm Hg with retroperfusion. Four patients required prolonged retroperfusion for treatment of angioplasty-induced complications. The mean retroperfusion duration in these patients was 4 +/- 2 h (range 2 to 7). In the three patients who underwent emergency bypass surgery, the coronary sinus was directly visualized during surgery and found to be without significant injury. There were no major complications. Minor adverse effects were transient atrial fibrillation (n = 2), jugular venous catheter insertion site hematomas (n = 4) and atrial wall staining (n = 1), all of which subsided spontaneously. Thus, retroperfusion significantly reduced and delayed the onset of coronary angioplasty-induced myocardial ischemia and provided effective supportive therapy for failed and complicated angioplasty. 
Recurrent herpes simplex keratitis with concurrent epithelial and stromal involvement. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations. A 65-year-old man with recurrent herpetic keratitis underwent corneal transplantation for persistent nonimmunologic graft failure. Histopathologic examination of the corneal button revealed an epithelial dendrite containing Cowdry type A inclusion bodies, moderate stromal edema, and a retrocorneal fibrous membrane. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated herpes simplex virus antigens in epithelial cells bordering the dendritic defect and in stromal keratocytes. The mean width of corneal epithelium displaying herpes simplex virus-positive epithelial cells on either side of the dendritic defect measured 200 +/- 46 microns. By electron microscopy, herpesvirus particles were identified in epithelial cells lining the dendrite as well as in stromal keratocytes. Infected keratocytes were scattered throughout the stroma but were not observed subjacent to the epithelial dendrite. This study demonstrates that a recurrent epithelial dendrite can be associated with subclinical stromal infection of the graft. 
Usefulness of late coronary thrombolysis (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator) in preserving left ventricular function in acute myocardial infarction. This study assesses whether administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) up to 8 hours after onset of symptoms of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) may result in a significant improvement in left ventricular function. Sixty patients were classified into 3 groups: group A (n = 21) received rt-PA within 4 hours from symptom onset; the remaining 39 patients, admitted between 4 and 8 hours, were randomized into 2 groups--group B (n = 19) received rt-PA, and group C (n = 21) was treated with conventional therapy. Coronary and left ventricular angiograms were recorded 8 to 10 days after rt-PA administration. The patency rate of the infarct-related artery was 76% in group A, and 63 and 35% in group B and C, respectively. The Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial perfusion grade was higher in group A and B than in group C (A vs C: p less than 0.005; B vs C: p less than 0.01). Left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in group A (60.2 +/- 10%) and B (54.7 +/- 12%) compared with group C (44.2 +/- 12%) (A vs C: p less than 0.01; B vs C: p less than 0.05). Regional wall motion of the entire ischemic zone was better in group A and B than in group C (A vs C: p less than 0.001; B vs C: p less than 0.01). In contrast, the kinesis of the central ischemic zone was significantly better in group A than in both group B and C (A vs B: p less than 0.05; A vs C: p less than 0.001). 
Blood flow reactivity to hypercapnia in strictly unilateral carotid disease: preliminary results. To show relationship between degree of carotid arterial stenosis and cerebral blood flow reactivity (RES%) to induced hypercapnia, fluorine-18-fluoromethane and positron emission tomography (PET) was used to study 18 patients with carotid distribution transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), all free of stroke, who had angiographic-proven unilateral arterial disease. Non-involved carotid arteries were either normal or had non-stenotic plaque. Either normal arteries or nonstenotic ulcerations in the symptomatic carotid arteries were present in five of 18 (28%), ipsilateral carotid stenosis from 50-99% was present in eight of 18 (44%), and ipsilateral internal carotid occlusion was present in five of 18 (28%) patients. In comparison with 14 normal controls, all patients with symptomatic middle cerebral artery (MCA) flow territories had significantly lower mean (SEM) RES% [5.0' (0.2) vs 4.0 (0.9), p less than 0.04]. Symptomatic anterior borderzone (ABZ) RES% was also significantly lower [4.6 (0.4) vs 3.3 (0.9), p less than 0.04], than controls. In patient subgroup comparisons, the 50-99% stenosis subgroup clearly had the lowest MCA RES% [3.4 (0.2)] as well as the lowest ABZ RES% [2.8 (0.4)] on their symptomatic sides. Age, expired pCO2, mean arterial blood pressure, serum glucose, serum haematocrit and number, type and estimated duration of TIAs were not significantly different between subgroups. Linear regression showed a significant relationship between RES% and both measured percentage-stenosis (p = 0.04) and residual luminal diameter (p = 0.05) in symptomatic MCA territories. This approached significance in symptomatic ABZ regions. This preliminary data set suggests that unilateral carotid stenosis can and does result in impaired CO2 reactivity following hypercapnia. 
Is it time to use evoked potentials to predict outcome in comatose children and adults? OBJECTIVE: To determine the value of multimodality-evoked potential recordings in predicting outcome in comatose children. DESIGN: Prospective series and literature review. SETTING: Pediatric ICU in a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-one children with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of less than 8, who were admitted to the pediatric ICU between 1984 and 1989. INTERVENTIONS: Forty-one patients underwent brainstem auditory-evoked potential testing within 72 hrs of admission. Of these patients, 37 also had somatosensory-evoked potential testing at the same time. Four patients did not receive somatosensory-evoked potential testing for various nonmedical reasons. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Multimodality-evoked potential recordings were used to predict outcome in these comatose children. Outcomes were categorized as bad (death or chronic vegetative state) or good (all other outcomes). Survivor outcomes were determined at discharge and on subsequent follow-up visits from 1 to 3 yrs later. There were no false pessimistic predictions, and two false optimistic predictions in this series. A comprehensive literature review of coma outcome prediction, using multimodality-evoked potential recordings, revealed 20 series with 982 additional patients in whom the predictive errors of false optimism and false pessimism could be determined. Five cases of false pessimism and 99 cases of false optimism were identified in the 982 additional patients. If neonates are excluded, the false pessimism number is reduced to three. CONCLUSIONS: A bad outcome can be reliably predicted using multimodality-evoked potential recordings with little chance of a false pessimistic prediction. The acceptable error of false optimism occurs frequently, since patients often die of progressive neurologic and nonneurologic problems that may or may not be present at the time of the evoked potential recordings. Thus, in comatose children, multimodality-evoked potential recordings are a useful adjunct to clinical examination and other diagnostic aids in predicting outcome and in making decisions regarding the degree of intervention to offer. 
Cardiac manifestations of Weber-Christian disease: report and review of the literature. A patient with chronic systemic Weber-Christian disease who was treated with hydroxychloroquine developed cardiac dilatation with congestive heart failure. Endomyocardial biopsy demonstrated myocyte degeneration and interstitial fibrosis, but no typical features of chloroquine induced cardiomyopathy. Clinical symptoms of congestive heart failure also were recognized in 7 of the 11 reported autopsy cases of Weber-Christian disease having cardiac involvement. This involvement can affect the pericardium and the myocardium. 
Preimplantation genetics: chromosomes of fragmented human embryos. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the chromosome makeup of fragmented human embryos. DESIGN: Prospective. SETTING: Assisted reproductive technology (ART) program. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-one poor-quality embryos from 58 patients 31 to 40 years of age admitted for an ART program were examined for chromosome makeup. RESULTS: Chromosome anomalies were observed in 31.9% (29/91) of poor-quality embryos, 19.8% (18/91) displayed mosaicism (diploid/haploid, diploid/triploid, diploid/aneuploid), 5.5% (5/91) showed polyploidy, 2.2% (2/91) had pulverized chromosomes, 2.2% (2/91) revealed aneuploidy, 1.1% (1/91) had prematurely condensed chromosomes, and 1.1% (1/91) had structural rearrangements involving chromosome number 2. The mean age of patients showing anomalies (36.5 years) was not significantly higher than the mean for the entire group (35.5 years). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of chromosome anomalies in fragmented human embryos is high. These anomalies originate either in the gametes or through mitotic nondisjunction within the embryos. It is not advisable to replace such embryos into patients going through in vitro fertilization. 
Late follow-up of carotid endarterectomy with venous patch angioplasty. Ninety carotid endarterectomies with venous patch angioplasty were performed in 83 patients between July 1980 and December 1985. The primary indication for patching was a small-caliber internal carotid artery (ICA) with a diameter less than 3.0 mm in 54 arteriotomies (60%). Patency of the endarterectomy was evaluated by completion arteriography in all instances. Follow-up was conducted after an intermediate postoperative period of 21 +/- 12.5 months in 69 sides by arteriography. A late follow-up was conducted at 55.4 +/- 11.2 months either by arteriography (in 45 sides) or by carotid duplex scanning (in 11 sides). Twenty-one patients with 23 endarterectomies died, only 1 of a cerebral event. Seven patients moved or refused study and five were lost to follow-up. Three recurrent stenoses and five carotid occlusions developed by the time of the intermediate follow-up. By the time of late follow-up, three additional patients developed recurrent stenoses. Our results suggest that recurrent stenosis continues to develop with a longer period of follow-up in patients undergoing venous patch angioplasty with carotid endarterectomy. 
Growth-hormone releasing hormone in a bronchial carcinoid. The case is reported of a 43-year-old patient with a peripherally located bronchial carcinoid tumor containing large amounts of immunoreactive and bioactive growth-hormone releasing hormone (GHRH). Because no GHRH was found in the peripheral circulation, there was no quantitative or qualitative derangement of growth-hormone secretion. The tumor was excised completely by thoracotomy. 
Congenital biliary cysts in Indian adults. Only one report of congenital biliary cysts has been described so far from India, and that was in children. We present our experience with 22 adult Indian patients with this condition. The main presenting symptoms were abdominal pain, icterus, and fever, and the classical triad of jaundice, pain, and abdominal mass was seen in only one patient. The mean age of presentation was 25.5 +/- 10.1 yr, and females predominated (82%). Type Ia cysts (fusiform choledochal cyst) were the commonest. Intrahepatic cysts were seen in four patients; three of these were associated with extrahepatic biliary ductal cysts (type IVa). Internal drainage procedures performed elsewhere in six patients were followed by recurrent cholangitis, necessitating excision of the cyst. Hence, the preferred operation for congenital biliary cysts is cyst excision and hepaticojejunostomy. 
How to identify psychogenic disorders of stance and gait. A video study in 37 patients. Thirty-seven patients with psychogenic disorders of stance and gait were clinically evaluated, recorded on video, and analysed with regard to clinical phenomenology. Characteristic, suggestive and unspecific features were identified. Six characteristic features proved most valuable for diagnosis of psychogenesis, as they occurred alone or in combination in 97% of patients: (1) momentary fluctuations of stance and gait, often in response to suggestion; (2) excessive slowness or hesitation of locomotion incompatible with neurological disease; (3) "psychogenic" Romberg test with a build-up of sway amplitudes after a silent latency or with improvement by distraction; (4) uneconomic postures with wastage of muscular energy; (5) the "walking on ice" gait pattern, which is characterized by small cautious steps with fixed ankle joints; (6) sudden buckling of the knees, usually without falls. Seventy-three percent of patients had additional suggestive features. Classification into characteristic subtypes was not found useful because predominant features varied from patient to patient and occurred in various combinations. Factitious impairment of stance and gait was studied in 13 healthy drama students. Simulated gait dysfunction appeared less conspicuous and more difficult to diagnose than the clinical psychogenic disorders. 
Abdominal cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst: occurrence after intraperitoneal urological surgery in children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Increasingly, children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts are undergoing urinary tract reconstructive surgery with bowel. The peritoneal end of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt tubing usually is exposed during the procedure, making the system vulnerable to infections and malfunction. The records of 103 myelomeningocele children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts and bowel-bladder reconstructive surgical procedures (27) were reviewed for evidence of an abdominal cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst (6). Pseudocyst formation occurred in only 1 of 76 ventriculoperitoneal shunt patients (1.3%) who had not undergone versus 6 of 27 (22%) who had undergone an intra-abdominal procedure. The 6 children had a total of 8 pseudocysts, including 7 pseudocysts that developed 8 days to 47 months (average 15.1 months) after the reconstructive surgery and 1 that developed before reconstructive surgery. All patients had abdominal symptoms (pain or mass) or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure. Treatment included computerized tomography-guided needle aspiration or abdominal exploration with cyst evacuation and shunt repositioning or replacement. The walls of the pseudocyst were formed by matted loops of bowel. Additional shunt surgery was required in 5 patients with conversion to ventriculoatrial shunts. We conclude that the development of an abdominal cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst is at least in part related to the prior abdominal surgery. Thus, pediatric urological and general surgeons caring for children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts should be aware of this complication. 
Mechanism of the increased ventilatory response to exercise in patients with chronic heart failure. Minute ventilation, respiratory rate, and metabolic gas exchange were measured continuously during maximal symptom limited treadmill exercise in 30 patients with stable chronic heart failure. The ventilatory response to exercise was assessed by calculation of the slope of the relation between minute ventilation and rate of carbon dioxide production. There was a close correlation between the severity of heart failure, determined as the maximal rate of oxygen consumption, and the ventilatory response to exercise. Reanalysis of the data after correction for ventilation of anatomical dead space did not significantly weaken the correlation but reduced the slope of the relation by approximately one third. These results show that the increased ventilatory response to exercise in patients with chronic heart failure is largely caused by mechanisms other than increased ventilation of anatomical dead space. This finding supports the concept that a significant pulmonary ventilation/perfusion mismatch develops in patients with chronic heart failure and suggests that the magnitude of this abnormality is directly related to the severity of chronic heart failure. 
Mania in the elderly: a 5-7 year follow-up. A 5-7 year follow-up study of elderly individuals hospitalized on an acute psychiatric inpatient service for bipolar disorder, manic phase, demonstrates that the prognosis of mania has improved in the past 30 years. A majority of those hospitalized for mania are alive and living independently 5 years after hospitalization. However, eight of 25 (32%) patients have experienced a decline in Mini-Mental State Exam score to below 24, suggesting a clinically significant cognitive disorder. Mortality rates were higher in the manic group than expected from population norms. Compared to a group of similarly aged individuals hospitalized for unipolar depression, patients with bipolar disorder had an earlier age of onset and a lesser likelihood of being rehospitalized. 
Recognition, management, and prevention of Clostridium septicum abscess in immunosuppressed patients. Spontaneous gas gangrene due to Clostridium septicum is a rapidly progressing disease that usually ends in fatal toxemia. We report three cases of asymptomatic C septicum abscesses to document the clinical course of this entity and to establish guidelines for its prevention and treatment. In contrast to previously reported data, C septicum infections can produce abscesses in solid organs, the retroperitoneum, and the extremities. These lesions often occur in patients with cancer, producing liver abscesses without gas formation that may be misinterpreted as metastatic carcinoma. Symptoms may be minimal or nonspecific before fulminant toxemia. Asymptomatic bacteremia should prompt a search for unsuspected cancer and an abscess. Computed tomography is the diagnostic modality of choice. The treatment consists of surgical debridement of necrotic tissue in concert with an appropriate course of antibiotics. We have found recurrences after adequate debridement and short-term antibiotic therapy, suggesting that prolonged and even lifelong prophylactic oral penicillin G potassium may be necessary to prevent further recurrences. 
High levels of p19/nm23 protein in neuroblastoma are associated with advanced stage disease and with N-myc gene amplification. The gene encoding a novel protein designated nm23-H1, which was recently identified as identical to the A subunit of nucleotide diphosphate kinase from human erythrocytes, has been proposed to play a role in tumor metastasis suppression. We report that untreated neuroblastoma tumors contain a cellular polypeptide (Mr = 19,000) designated p19, identified in two-dimensional electrophoretic gels, which occurs at significantly higher levels (P = 0.0001) in primary tumors containing amplified N-myc gene. The partial amino acid sequence obtained for p19 is identical to the sequence of the human nm23-H1 protein. An antibody to the A subunit of erythrocyte nucleotide diphosphate kinase reacted exclusively with p19. In this study, significantly higher levels of p19/nm23 occurred in primary neuroblastoma tumors from patients with advanced stages (III and IV) relative to tumors from patients with limited stages (I and II) of the disease. Even among patients with a single copy of the N-myc gene, tumors from patients with stages III and IV had statistically significantly higher levels of p19/nm23 than tumors from patients with stages I and II. Our findings indicate that, in contrast to a proposed role for nm23-H1 as a tumor metastasis suppressor, increased p19/nm23 protein in neuroblastoma is correlated with features of the disease that are associated with aggressive tumors. Therefore, nm23-H1 may have distinct if not opposite roles in different tumors. 
Failed in vitro fertilization of human oocytes: a cytogenetic analysis. OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible causes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) failure. DESIGN: A retrospective cytogenetic study of human oocytes divided into four groups or, alternatively, into two groups according to fertilization rates and whether the patients became pregnant or not. Two additional groups included oocytes in which there was no or only partial fertilization. SETTING: Primary treatment of infertility in an institutional practice. PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-three inseminated-unfertilized oocytes from 87 women entering the IVF program because of tubal, unknown, and male infertility. Immunological infertility was excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Ultrasound-guided transvaginal follicular aspiration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Planned after data collection. RESULTS: The rate of chromosome anomalies did not show any significant difference among the four groups established according to the fertilization rate and between pregnant and nonpregnant patients. Independently, our data identified male factor as responsible for 41%, chromosome anomalies 19.3%, oocyte immaturity 11.8%, and unknown etiology 41% of fertilization failures (based on analysis of 161 oocytes). CONCLUSIONS: Fertilization rate and pregnancy outcome after IVF are not related to the incidence of oocyte chromosome anomalies. 
The survival of total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis of the medial condyle. The results of total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The study included 32 osteonecrotic knees with an average final follow-up examination of 3.9 years. For comparison, 63 osteoarthrotic knees with an average final follow-up examination of 4.6 years were also analyzed. The survival rates were calculated using four distinct categories of failure: (1) revision, (2) revision or radiolucency, (3) revision, radiolucency, or pain, and (4) pain. On the basis of pain relief alone, the five-year postoperative success rate was 82% for osteonecrosis (eight knees) and 90% for osteoarthrosis (27 knees), with no significant statistical difference between the two groups. 
Propranolol ameliorates the development of portal-systemic shunting in a chronic murine schistosomiasis model of portal hypertension. We investigated the role of early portal hypotensive pharmacotherapy in preventing the development of portal-systemic shunting in a portal hypertensive model of chronic murine schistosomiasis induced by infecting C3H mice with 60 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Propranolol was administered in drinking water to 20 animals for a period of 6 wk at a dose of 10 mg.kg-1d-1, starting at 5 wk of schistosomal infection. 32 age-matched mice with chronic schistosomal infection served as controls. All animals were studied 11 wk after the infection. Compared with controls the portal pressure (10.8 +/- 0.40 mmHg) was significantly lower (P less than 0.001) in the propranolol-treated animals (7.9 +/- 0.80 mmHg). Portal-systemic shunting was decreased by 79%, from 12.2 +/- 3.34% in controls to 2.5 +/- 0.99% in the propranolol group (P less than 0.05). Portal venous inflow was reduced by 38% in the propranolol treated animals (2.50 +/- 0.73 ml/min; n = 6) compared with controls (4.00 +/- 0.34 ml/min; n = 8; P less than 0.05). The worm burden, the granulomatous reaction, the collagen content of the liver, and the serum bile acid levels were not significantly different between the two groups of animals. These results demonstrate that in chronic liver disease induced by schistosomiasis, the development of portal-systemic shunting can be decreased or prevented by the reduction of flow and pressure in the portal system. 
Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia after resection of thoracic esophageal cancer. The rate of occurrence of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia (PHB) following esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer was 67%, 115/171 cases, which was significantly higher than those following total gastrectomy (28%, 40/144 cases) and colectomy (12%, 7/59 cases). Among the operative procedures, right thoracotomy with extensive lymphoadenectomy had the highest rate of PHB (87%), perhaps due to the longest operation time and the largest intraoperative blood loss. Preoperative risk factors were glucose intolerance, reduced lymphocyte count, and poor nutritional state. The change in bile acid composition, as well as the elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, indicated the presence of postoperative cholestasis which was relevant to total parenteral nutrition. The results suggest that the development of PHB was related to the extent of surgery and the use of parenteral nutrition. 
Regional nodal failure after conservative surgery and radiotherapy for early-stage breast carcinoma. We retrospectively analyzed the likelihood of regional nodal failure (RNF) for 1,624 patients with stage I or II invasive breast carcinoma treated with conservative surgery and radiotherapy (RT) at the Joint Center for Radiation Therapy (JCRT) between 1968 and 1985. The median follow-up time was 77 months. RNF was the first site of failure for 38 of the 1,624 patients (2.3%). The incidence of axillary failure for patients undergoing axillary dissection (AXD) who were irradiated to the breast only was 2.1% (nine of 420) for patients with negative nodes and 2.1% (one of 47) for patients with one to three positive nodes. The incidence of supraclavicular failure in these two groups was 1.9% (eight of 420) and 0% (zero of 47), respectively. The incidences of axillary and supraclavicular failure in patients without clinically suspicious axillary involvement who did not have AXD but were treated with RT were 0.8% (three of 355) and 0.3% (one of 364), respectively. Despite various combinations of salvage surgery, RT, and systemic therapy, only 47% of patients (18 of 38) achieved complete regional control after nodal relapse. We conclude that RNF is uncommon in patients treated to the breast alone following an adequate AXD when the axillary nodes are negative or when one to three nodes are positive. RNF is also uncommon in patients with a clinically uninvolved axilla treated with nodal RT without AXD. Symptoms of RNF can be controlled in most but not all patients. Further study is needed to determine if the benefits of RT in preventing a small number of symptomatic RNF outweigh the potential toxicity for any subgroup of patients. 
Open, double-blind and long-term study of vigabatrin in chronic epilepsy. We performed an open, double-blind, and long-term study of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl-GABA, GVG) in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy who were receiving only one or at most two standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The novel design included a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase that minimized the number of patients receiving placebo and allowed determination of the optimum dose of GVG for each patient before initiation of the double-blind phase. The study was divided into four phases. The first phase was a 6-week period of baseline observation. In the second phase, GVG was added openly to previous AEDs for 8 weeks. During the first 2 weeks of this phase, the dose of GVG was increased weekly and then, in the absence of adverse effects, was held constant for the next 6 weeks. At the end of this open phase, seizure frequency during the 6 weeks of constant treatment was compared with the baseline seizure frequency for each patient. Patients who experienced reduction greater than 50% in the frequency of any seizure type during the open phase were defined as responders. These responders were then entered into the third and double-blind phase, in which they were randomly allocated wither to continue active GVG treatment or placebo for 8 weeks. Thirty-three patients entered the study; 31 of 33 patients completed the initial open phase. Twenty patients achieved a reduction greater than or equal to 50% in the frequency of one or more seizure types and were eligible for the double-blind phase; 10 were randomized to continue GVG and 10 were randomized to placebo. 
Syncope and orthostatic hypotension. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the postural blood pressure response over time, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with syncope, and the relationship of orthostatic hypotension to recurrence of symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 223 patients with syncope in a standardized manner. Orthostatic responses were measured in a standardized fashion at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 minutes or until symptoms occurred. Follow-up was obtained at 3-month intervals. Causes of syncope were assigned by predetermined criteria. RESULTS: Orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure decline) was found in 69 patients (31%). The median time to reach minimal standing systolic blood pressure was 1 minute for all subjects. In patients with orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater), mean time to reach minimum blood pressure was 2.4 minutes. The vast majority of patients with significant orthostatic hypotension had this finding within 2 minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension was common in patients for whom other probable causes of syncope were assigned. The recurrence of syncope was not related to the degree of orthostatic hypotension; however, the recurrence of dizziness and syncope as end-points was lower in patients with 20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure reductions as compared with patients with lesser degrees of orthostatic blood pressure declines. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic hypotension is common in patients with syncope and is detected in the vast majority of patients by 2 minutes. Although symptom recurrence on follow-up was lower in patients with more severe orthostatic hypotension, the clinical significance of this finding needs to be further defined by future studies. 
Spinal anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in high-risk neonates. To avoid the high incidence of respiratory complications associated with general anaesthesia in premature neonates, 44 spinal anaesthetics for inguinal hernia repair in very low birthweight infants were administered in 47 attempts. Hyperbaric tetracaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 was administered in a dose range of 0.27-1.10 mg.kg-1. Attempted lumbar puncture failed in three infants. In 24 procedures, spinal anaesthesia alone provided satisfactory operating conditions; in 20, supplementary inhalational general anaesthesia or iv ketamine was necessary. Perioperative apnoeic episodes requiring bag/mask assisted ventilation occurred in six infants. In five infants, apnoeic spells occurred in the postoperative period. No infant required tracheal intubation; there was no haemodynamic instability. Twenty-four infants required no postoperative analgesia. Our experience suggests that spinal anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in very low birth weight infants reduces but does not eliminate the risk of respiratory instability, and that supplementary anaesthesia is often necessary to provide satisfactory operating conditions. 
Turcot's syndrome. Flow cytometric analysis. Turcot's syndrome is a rare, genetically transmittable disease in which patients with colonic polyposis (possibly complicated by the progression to adenocarcinoma) have malignant central nervous system neoplasms. Dominant, recessive, and sporadic cases have been described. A 26-year-old man is reported with no relevant family history who had intermittent abdominal discomfort in 1986. Sigmoidoscopy revealed numerous polyps, several of which showed carcinomatous change. Dukes' Stage C colorectal carcinoma was diagnosed. Treatment consisted of total colectomy with construction of a Koch's pouch. He remained well for 3 years until onset of headache, nausea, and vomiting. Computed tomographic scan disclosed a large, circumscribed, enhancing, right frontoparietal mass. After craniotomy and partial resection, histologic review disclosed anaplastic astrocytoma. He received cranial radiation therapy, 6000 cGy, by parallel opposed ports to the tumor bed, and carmustine 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 8 weeks. Flow cytometric DNA analysis was done on the paraffin-embedded archival material from the patient's normal colon, colonic adenocarcinoma, and anaplastic astrocytoma. DNA histograms revealed diploid distributions in all three samples. The G2/M fraction of the astrocytoma was elevated at 16%, and the S-phase fraction of the colonic adenocarcinoma was 19.4%. 
Immediate vs. delayed treatment of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis with penicillin V. Three hundred six children with probable Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis were enrolled in a randomized double blind trial to compare the effects of immediate vs. delayed treatment with oral penicillin V. Among the 229 culture-positive patients, 111 were randomly assigned to receive penicillin V immediately and 118 to receive a placebo for 48 to 52 hours followed by penicillin V. Patients were evaluated clinically for 48 to 52 hours following initiation of treatment. The Streptozyme test was used to measure acute to convalescent antibody titer. Both regimens resulted in a greater than 92% cure rate. Early treatment was associated with significantly fewer and milder signs and symptoms on Day 3 and a significantly lower rise in the antibody titer. On the other hand we found 8 (7%) relapses and 18 (16%) early and 14 (13%) late recurrences in this group; all were significantly higher than the corresponding numbers of 2 (2%), 6 (5%) and 4 (3%), respectively, in the late treatment group. This study shows the beneficial effect of early treatment with penicillin V on the clinical course of Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. This study also shows that delayed penicillin treatment may be associated with a lower incidence of subsequent Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis. 
Induction of nm23 gene expression in human colonic neoplasms and equal expression in colon tumors of high and low metastatic potential. Levels of expression of the murine nm23 gene inversely correlate with metastatic potential in several rodent tumor model systems. Expression of the human nm23 homologue also is lower in human breast cancers of high metastatic potential than in breast cancers of low metastatic potential. In the present study, we examined changes in nm23 expression during colon carcinogenesis as found in 18 matched pairs of normal and neoplastic human colon tissues. We found that a 0.8-kilo-base nm23 transcript was expressed in all samples of morphologically normal colon mucosa. In 16 of 18 colon neoplasms, nm23 expression was further increased in the neoplastic, compared with the morphologically normal, colon mucosa from the same individual. Expression of nm23 was elevated over normal mucosa in 3 of 3 polyps, in 2 of 3 nonmetastatic cancers, and in 11 of the 12 cancers that were metastatic at the initial presentation. The levels of nm23 expressed were similar in the 12 metastatic colon neoplasms and in the 6 colon neoplasms of lower clinical stage. In addition, nm23 expression was maintained in culture in each of 12 cell lines initiated from human colon neoplasms and did not differ between lines established from neoplasms of high or low metastatic capability. We concluded that nm23 was expressed in normal colon mucosa. Expression of nm23 increased during early stages of colon carcinogenesis and remained increased in metastatic colon cancer. Therefore, in the colon, tissue-specific events dissociate nm23 expression from loss of tumor metastatic competence. 
Biliary pancreatitis. Operative outcome with a selective approach. To evaluate the efficacy of a selective approach to biliary pancreatitis, we reviewed the outcomes in 276 consecutive patients undergoing operations for this diagnosis during a 7-year period. Initial conservative therapy resulted in elective operations in 63% and urgent operations in 37%. Only 10 patients (3.6%) required primary pancreatic operations, 50% of them as emergencies. The proportion of common duct surgical explorations fell from 70% of those operated immediately after hospital admission to 20% by the third hospital day. Overall mortality was 1.8% but was increased to 30% in patients having an initial pancreatic operation. We conclude that a selective approach to biliary pancreatitis allows the operation to be performed electively in most patients and is associated with a low mortality and an acceptable length of stay. Most common duct stones pass spontaneously permitting cholecystectomy alone. 
The heterogeneity of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). III. The occurrence and biological and immunological activities of nicked hCG. Nicks, or missing peptide linkages, have been found in hCG beta-subunit between residues 44 and 45 and between residues 47 and 48. We examined the occurrence and biological and immunological activities of nicked hCG. As shown by sequence analysis, CR127 standard hCG is approximately 20% nicked, half at beta 44-45 and half at beta 47-48. Treatment with human leukocyte elastase increased the extent of nicking of CR127 standard hCG. The longer the incubation of CR127 standard with human leukocyte elastase (0, 2, and 21 h), the greater the extent of nicked hCG (20%, 46%, and 89%). As the extent of nicking increased, the receptor-binding ability diminished, as did the ability to stimulate progesterone production by rat corpus luteal cells in vitro (0.9, 0.74, and 0.29 microgram/microgram hCG, respectively). In a regression analysis, a linear relationship was indicated between the extent of nicking and receptor binding values (97% correlation) and between the extent of nicking and steroidogenic activity in vitro (99% correlation). From the intercepts of the regression lines, it was estimated that nicks reduced receptor binding by 11-fold and reduced the steroidogenic activity of hCG by 5-fold. We examined eight individual hCG preparations, three purified from pregnancy urine, three from urine from patients with hydatidiform mole, and two from urine from women with choriocarcinoma. In descending order, the eight individual hCG preparations were 100%, 100%, 85%, 76%, 42%, 41%, 0%, and 0% intact. Although no correlation was observed between the percent intact and the ability of the eight individual samples to displace 50% [125I]hCG in binding CG/LH receptor (r less than 0.5), a close correlation was noted between the percent intact and the steroidogenic activity in vitro (98% correlation). This separated the effects of nicking on receptor binding and steroidogenic activities and indicated that while multiple factors influence receptor binding, only nicking suppresses the steroidogenic activity of bound hCG. We examined the recognition of nicked hCG molecules by different hCG immunoassays. The Hybritech Tandem assay measured total hCG and did not distinguish nicked and intact hCG molecules (in a regression analysis, immunoactivity vs. percent intact hCG, r less than 0.5). In contrast, the immunometric assay using B109 hCG dimer-specific monoclonal antibody and anti-beta-peroxidase only detected the intact component of hCG (in a regression analysis, immunoreactivity vs. percent intact hCG, 98% correlation). We used these assays together to estimate the percentage of intact hCG and to deduce the extent of nicking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Sodium channel density in hypomyelinated brain increased by myelin basic protein gene deletion. Trophic control over the expression and membrane distribution of voltage-dependent ion channels is one of the principal organizing events underlying the maturation of excitable cells. The myelin sheath is a major structural determinant of regional ion channel topography in central axons, but the exact molecular signals that mediate local interactions between the oligodendrocyte and axolemma are not known. We have found that large caliber fibre pathways in the brain of the mutant mouse shiverer (shi, gene on chromosome 18), whose developmental fate of myelination is averted by deletion of five exons in the myelin basic protein gene, have a striking excess of sodium channels. As cytoplasmic membranes of shiverer oligodendroglia still adhere to axons, the evidence indicates that myelin basic protein or a myelin basic protein-dependent glial transmembrane signal associated with compact myelin formation, rather than a simple glial-axon contact inhibition or an intrinsic genetic program of neuronal differentiation, could be critical in downregulating sodium channel density in axons. Here we use the shiverer mutant to show that mature central nervous system projection neurons with large caliber unmyelinated fibres sustain functional excitability by increasing sodium channel density. This axon plasticity, triggered by the absence of a single glial protein, contributes to the unexpectedly mild degree of neurological impairment in the mutant brain without myelin, and may be a potentially inducible mechanism determining the recovery of function from dysmyelinating disease. 
Cholestatic liver reaction during heparin therapy. Three patients are reported who developed liver enzyme abnormalities of a cholestatic pattern, without jaundice, after 10-28 d of heparin treatment. The values normalized within 4 months in all patients. Thus heparin should be added to the list of drugs that may cause a cholestatic liver reaction. 
Acute thrombosis of the renal transplant artery: a case report and review of the literature. Acute thrombosis of the renal transplant artery is a known but unusual complication of renal transplantation usually occurring in the first month. Reported here is a case of acute renal artery thrombosis in a well functioning long-term renal allograft in which there was clear angiographic evidence of a normal renal artery two years earlier. 
Autoimmune MRL-1 pr/1pr mice are an animal model for the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus often develop thrombosis, recurrent abortion, thrombocytopenia and neurological disease, in association with serum antibodies against phospholipids, termed the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. In our search for an animal model for the human antiphospholipid syndrome, we examined the MRL-1pr/pr mouse, which develops a lupus-like illness. These mice were found to have significantly elevated levels of serum antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) and thrombocytopenia compared to normal mice. By immunodiffusion, these antibodies are similar to human aPL. We observed histologic evidence of central nervous system thromboses as well as perivascular infiltrates of the choroid plexus. The high titers of serum aPL, thrombocytopenia, and thrombosis establish this strain as an animal model for the secondary antiphospholipid syndrome. 
Massive acute arsenic poisoning. A 28-year-old male ingested 75 g of arsenic trioxide in a successful suicide attempt. The presentation, management and postmortem findings are presented and discussed. 
Hypercarbic periodic breathing during sleep in a child with a central nervous system tumor. A 4-yr-old girl with a ganglioglioma involving the cerebellum and pons presented with CO2 retention and arterial O2 desaturation during wakefulness and sleep. Despite the presence of a regular respiratory pattern during wakefulness, NREM sleep was associated with the appearance of a sustained periodic respiratory pattern characterized by clusters of usually two breaths separated by an 8 to 10-s expiratory pause. At sleep onset, this Biot's respiratory pattern appeared immediately after a sigh. Breathing frequency during NREM sleep became regular with administration of supplemental O2 and an attendant increase in end-tidal CO2. Shortly after withdrawal of supplemental O2 during NREM sleep, the periodic pattern resumed and was again immediately preceded by a sigh. The observations during NREM sleep in this patient with a central nervous system abnormality indicate that Biot's type respiratory pattern may be reversed by administration of supplemental oxygen. The results in this patient suggest: (1) the presence of a very elevated CO2 apnea threshold, and (2) that the pons may play a role in determining the effect of hypercapnic hypoxia on respiratory pattern during sleep. 
Pseudopathologies of hemostasis and dental surgery. Values of hemostasis tests are grossly abnormal in persons with factor XII deficiency, dysfibrinogenemia, the lupuslike anticoagulant, and pseudothrombocytopenia, yet these persons do not usually bleed spontaneously or even after surgery. We reviewed the records of 66 patients with laboratory diagnosis of one of the aforementioned abnormalities to determine whether they bled excessively after challenges to hemostasis such as dental extractions. Only three of them bled excessively, but two of these had other concomitant causes that could explain bleeding. Hence the dentist should not give up dental extractions or other surgical procedures when results of hemostasis tests are grossly abnormal, because these are not necessarily associated with abnormal hemostasis. Obviously, the correct interpretation of abnormal hemostasis values warrants close collaboration and reciprocal consultation between the dentist and the hematologist. 
Benign cartilaginous tumors of the upper airway. Benign cartilaginous neoplasms of the laryngotracheal apparatus are uncommon clinical entities. Two cases of cartilaginous lesions of the upper airway are reported. Resection with maintenance of upper airway structural integrity is the preferred treatment. Temporary tracheostomy is often necessary and can provide access for stenting of the tracheal repair. 
Toxic oil syndrome: a current clinical and epidemiologic summary, including comparisons with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. In the spring and summer of 1981, an epidemic of a new illness now referred to as the toxic oil syndrome occurred in central and northwestern Spain, resulting in some 20,000 cases, 12,000 hospital admissions and greater than 300 deaths in the 1st year of the epidemic. The initial onset of illness was usually acute, and patients presented primarily with a respiratory syndrome involving cough, fever, dyspnea, hypoxemia, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions. While approximately 50% of patients recovered from this acute phase of the illness without apparent sequelae, the remaining patients developed an intermediate or chronic phase, or both, of illness involving severe myalgia, eosinophilia, peripheral nerve damage, sclerodermiform skin lesions, sicca syndrome, alopecia and joint contractures, among other findings. Epidemiologic and analytic chemical studies have clearly linked the toxic oil syndrome to the ingestion of oil mixtures containing rapeseed oil denatured with aniline. However, the precise identity of the etiologic agent within this oil has never been determined. Aniline itself did not cause the illness, but the causal agent may be a reaction product of aniline with some oil component. Although many aspects of disease activity in the involved patients have lessened with time, the ultimate consequences of their disease are not clear and are the subject of ongoing study. The recently described eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in the United States clinically resembles the toxic oil syndrome. 
Metastatic carcinoma of prostate 23 years after radical prostatectomy. Carcinoma of the prostate may present with metastatic disease many years after treatment. We present a patient with adenocarcinoma of the prostate, "cured" by radical perineal prostatectomy in 1962, with the first signs of metastases presenting in 1985. This emphasizes the importance of long-term follow-up of patients with prostate carcinoma. 
Headaches in adolescents. Diagnosis and management. A thorough history, general physical examination, neurologic evaluation, and charting of the temporal pattern of the headache will allow the correct diagnosis to be made under most circumstances. Laboratory testing is tailored to the specific headache syndrome. Psychological factors are important in all forms of adolescent headache and should be evaluated in each and every case. Once the correct diagnosis has been made, a comprehensive approach to the patient's problems, medical and psychological, will usually result in improvement. 
Acute effect of percutaneous transluminal mitral commissurotomy on QT interval: possible role of afterload in contraction-excitation feedback. Percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty for pulmonary or aortic stenosis results in QT prolongation, a finding supporting the presence of contraction-excitation feedback in man. Though afterload reduction alters the QT interval, the effect of changes in preload on ventricular repolarization is yet unknown. To test whether diastolic stretch modified ventricular repolarization, the change in the QT interval was determined in 15 patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) for mitral stenosis. After successful PTMC, the QT interval was prolonged in five, shortened in two, and was unchanged in eight patients, but the mean QT interval in 15 patients did not change (406 +/- 31 msec versus 412 +/- 40 msec, p = NS). However, linear regression analysis revealed a strong correlation between changes in the QT interval and those in systemic vascular resistance (r = -0.83, p less than 0.01). These data indicated that changes in the QT interval after PTMC were small compared with those seen with valvuloplasty for pulmonary or aortic stenosis, and were dependent on afterload but not on preload. 
Minimal resection for bronchogenic carcinoma. An update. Minimal resection with curative intent was performed for 24 patients with stage I bronchogenic carcinoma at our institutions over a 12-year period. This was usually done for patients who could not tolerate more extensive resections. The five-year actuarial survival rate was 65 percent. The rate of local recurrences was 13 percent (3/24), and the rate of distant recurrences was 17 percent (4/24), with a median follow-up of 38 months. Survival and recurrence rates are similar for patients undergoing minimal resection and those being reported for patients undergoing more extensive resections for stage I bronchogenic carcinoma. In selected patients, minimal resection should be considered as an acceptable alternative treatment for patients with stage I bronchogenic carcinoma. 
Activation by the protein-bound polysaccharide PSK (krestin) of cytotoxic lymphocytes that act on fresh autologous tumor cells and T24 human urinary bladder transitional carcinoma cell line in patients with urinary bladder cancer. PSK, a protein-bound polysaccharide Kureha, was tested for its ability to modulate the cytotoxicity of lymphocytes that act on autologous tumor cells and T24 human urinary bladder tumor cells in urinary bladder cancer patients in a 6-h 51Cr release assay. In vitro treatment of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) with PSK for 18 hours resulted in an augmentation or induction of cytotoxicity against relatively resistant T24 cells in previously reactive and nonreactive cases, respectively. The PSK-treated PBL were able to kill more effectively tumor cells that were freshly isolated from the same cancer patients than non-treated PBL. The effects of PSK were noted with PBL as well as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) and with PSK at concentrations of 10 to 100 micrograms./ml., while PSK at higher doses reduced their lytic activities. The addition of PSK to the assay at the same concentrations also enhanced the cytotoxicities. Autologous tumor killing (ATK) activities of both large granular lymphocytes (LGL) and T lymphocytes were enhanced by PSK. Treatment of PBL with PSK did not effect on the proportion of PBL binding to the tumor cells, while it augmented the cytotoxic activity. Cell-free supernatant of PSK-stimulated lymphocyte culture did not contain any detectable amounts of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). In addition, anti-IFN-alpha monoclonal antibody (MAb), anti-IFN-gamma MAb and anti-IL-2 MAb did not inhibit PSK-induced augmentation of cytotoxicity against T24. Oral administration of PSK (three gm./day) to patients with urinary bladder cancer daily for seven days before operation resulted in an augmentation of the cytotoxicity against T24 cells in five out of 10 patients and no change of the cytotoxicity in the other five patients. ATK activity was also enhanced by oral administration of PSK in three out of five patients. These results indicate that the antitumor activity of PSK may be in part mediated through activation of tumor killing system independent of IFN-alpha, IFN-gamma and IL-2. 
Ubiquitin in motor neuron disease: study at the light and electron microscope. Several neurodegenerative diseases, including motor neuron disease (MND), are characterized by formation of abnormal cytoskeleton-derived inclusions which contain ubiquitin (Ubq). We have studied the distribution of Ubq in 26 cases of MND with light and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry. Ubiquitin-positive inclusions were found in neurons of anterior horns in most cases of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) but were not present in other forms of MND. Ubiquitin immunoreactivity was observed in 10-15 nm intraneuronal filaments, which were not stained by antibodies to neurofilaments, and on dense bodies of dystrophic neurites throughout the neuropil of anterior horns and pyramidal tracts. Data analysis showed a trend toward lower percentage of Ubq-positive neurons in cases with longer duration of illness or lower number of neurons. A high percentage of Ubq-positive inclusions occurred in cases with an aggressive clinical course, suggesting that ubiquitination takes place at early stages of the disease. 
Painful tic convulsif caused by a contralateral vertebral artery. The case of trigeminal neuralgia and ipsilateral hemifacial spasm--painful tic convulsif--is presented. Microsurgical exploration revealed compression of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves by a tortuous contralateral vertebral artery. Neurovascular decompression of the roots entry/exit zone completely relieved preoperative facial pain and spasm. 
Acquired aphasia, dementia, and behavior disorder with epilepsy and continuous spike and waves during sleep in a child. Severe persistent neuropsychological disorders sometimes develop in the course of a focal epilepsy of unknown origin in previously normal children. Very frequent bilateral focal or generalized discharges are often noted on the sleep EEG records of these patients with no evidence of clinical seizures. The relation between these paroxysms and the observed deterioration remains unclear. We report a child with a partial complex epilepsy and severe disturbances of language, cognition, and behavior acquired in the early years of development who was followed for 15 years. A correlation between the evolution of the striking EEG abnormalities during sleep and the neuropsychological disorders could be established retrospectively. The observed sequence of onset and recovery of the aphasia, the dementia, and the "psychotic" behavior makes a direct causal relation between the deficits quite unlikely. Rather it suggests an association of independent symptoms with a specific language disorder becoming manifest in the course of the evolution. This child shows many of the main characteristics of the syndromes of "acquired aphasia with convulsive disorder" (Landau-Kleffner syndrome) and "epilepsy with continuous spike waves during sleep." Both syndromes describe probably different facets of a similar underlying, still unexplained cerebral dysfunction. 
Progressive vs single-stage treadmill tests for evaluation of claudication. The reliability of claudication pain and the metabolic and hemodynamic measurements of the lower limbs of patients with stable peripheral vascular occlusive disease (PVOD) were compared during and following single-stage (S) and progressive (P) treadmill tests. Ten patients (69.8 +/- 1.8 yr; X +/- SE) walked to maximal claudication pain twice a month for 4 months. Patients walked at 1.5 mph up a 7.5% grade (S test) and at 2 mph on a 0% grade, increasing by 2% every 2 min (P test). Distance walked to the onset of claudication pain (CPD) and maximal walking distance (MWD) were recorded. Foot transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) was measured before, during, and after exercise, while ankle systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the ankle-to-brachial SBP index (ABI) were measured before and after exercise. Intraclass correlation coefficients (R) of CPD and MWD during S tests were R = 0.53 and R = 0.55, respectively. In contrast, the respective R values during P tests were R = 0.89 and R = 0.93. Higher R values of foot TcPO2 were also obtained during and following P tests, while ankle SBP and ABI were highly reliable following both tests. It is concluded that the severity of PVOD is better assessed by P treadmill tests because clinical measurements are more reliable during exercise and recovery. 
Low-dose chemotherapy with central nervous system prophylaxis and zidovudine maintenance in AIDS-related lymphoma. A prospective multi-institutional trial. OBJECTIVE.--To ascertain if low-dose multiagent chemotherapy, with central nervous system prophylaxis and antiretroviral therapy, might be associated with increased efficacy and decreased risk of intercurrent infection in patients with malignant lymphoma related to the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). DESIGN.--A phase II prospective clinical trial, with median follow-up of 33 months. SETTING.--Eight university hospitals, within the context of the AIDS Clinical Trials Units, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. PATIENTS.--Forty-two patients with AIDS-related malignant lymphoma. All were evaluable for toxicity assessment, and 35 for response. INTERVENTION.--A low-dose modification of the M-BACOD regimen (day 1): cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2 intravenously (IV); doxorubicin, 25 mg/m2 IV; vincristine sulfate, 1.4 mg/m2 IV; bleomycin, 4 mg/m2 IV; dexamethasone, 3 mg/m2 orally on days 1 through 5; methotrexate, 500 mg/m2 IV on day 15, with leucovorin rescue. Intrathecal cytosine arabinoside (50 mg) to all on days 1, 8, 21, and 28, with radiation therapy to a helmet field to those with central nervous system involvement. Zidovudine for 12 months after completion of four to six cycles of chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Response rate and number of opportunistic infections. RESULTS.--Response rate was 51% with a complete response of 46%. Of 16 complete responses, relapse occurred in four, none isolated to the central nervous system. Opportunistic infections occurred in 21% of those receiving treatment. Median duration of survival among all 42 patients is 5.6 months, 6.5 months in 35 patients evaluable for response, and 15 months in patients with complete response. Lower concentration of CD4 cells, history of prior AIDS, bone marrow involvement, and stage IV disease were independently associated with decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS.--Low-dose chemotherapy with central nervous system prophylaxis and zidovudine maintenance may be associated with durable remissions in AIDS-related lymphoma with fewer opportunistic infections than noted in prior reports. 
Testolactone, sulindac, warfarin, and vitamin K1 for unresectable desmoid tumors. Ten patients with large inoperable desmoid tumors in various body locations were treated with testolactone. Four tumors (40%) responded with major regressions, i.e., more than 50% reduction in volume. Eight patients received nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, sulindac, or sulindac with warfarin and vitamin K1 [Mephyton]) for periods of 2 to 91 months. There was one major regression, one partial regression, and three instances of tumor growth arrest over periods up to 8 years. Seven patients were treated with nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs concurrent with or after testolactone or tamoxifen. There were five major regressions and one partial regression with extensive central necrosis of an enormous intra-abdominal tumor. The last patient has been treated for only 12 months, with no change in tumor volume. It appears that estrogens function as growth factors for desmoid tumors, and that minimization of these effects inhibits tumor growth in some, but not all, cases. In those instances where antiestrogens were not effective as single agents, the tumors usually responded to subsequent nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drug therapy. Withdrawal of estrogen may be followed by inhibition of transcription of genes that support tumor cell proliferation, and sulindac and indomethacin may augment these effects by inhibiting prostaglandin and cyclic AMP synthesis and the activity of protein kinase C. Warfarin may function as a protonophore to acidify the cytoplasm and prevent the alkalinization that is necessary to initiate DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression, again an impairment of the transcription process. 
Perioperative stroke. Part II: Cardiac surgery and cardiogenic embolic stroke. The major mechanism of stroke in cardiac surgery is embolization. The risk is higher in intracardiac than in extracardiac surgery. The incidence of stoke associated with CABG is about 5%. The cerebral protective properties of isoflurane and thiopentone, acid-base management, and monitoring of cerebral perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass are discussed. Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease before cardiac surgery is not necessary. Symptomatic carotid disease increases the risk of stroke, and the management of patients who have both symptomatic coronary and carotid artery diseases is discussed. Cardiogenic embolism is probably responsible for many perioperative strokes. Patients with atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, and prosthetic heart valves are at high risk of cardiogenic embolism. Strokes associated with cardioversion, pacemaker insertion, coronary arteriography and angioplasty are explored. 
Managing common dental problems and emergencies. This article discusses the more common oral and dental emergencies that children and adolescents may present to a physician. Many of these problems represent true emergencies that require immediate treatment or referral, whereas others are more common and less critical problems perceived by the child's parents as needing immediate attention. The problems presented in this article fall into three general areas: gingival and soft-tissue-related problems; problems related to teeth; and traumatic injuries to the teeth, their roots, and supporting structures. 
Streptococcal toxic shock associated with septic abortion. The group A streptococcus is capable of producing exotoxins that have been linked to a toxic shock-like syndrome. Streptococcal toxic shock is a rapidly progressive disease associated with injury to multiple organ systems and a 30-60% mortality rate. We present a case of a 40-year-old woman who developed group A streptococcal toxic shock following a spontaneous abortion. She required surgical debridement, pulmonary artery catheterization, mechanical ventilation, and massive transfusions. Clinicians must be aware of the presentation of this disease, as its incidence appears to be increasing. 
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with solid tumors without acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) developed in two patients with solid tumors without acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). In patients with neoplastic solid tumors, as in those with hematologic malignancies, Pneumocystis is a possible cause of pneumonia. Management protocols evaluating pulmonary infiltrates in this patient population must include tests for PCP. 
Oropharyngeal flora and chest infection after upper abdominal surgery. The oropharyngeal flora was determined before and after operation in 127 patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery. Swabs of the oropharynx were obtained on the day before operation and on the first, third, and fifth postoperative days. Isolation of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and coliforms was noted. In the 108 patients with the full series of throat swabs the incidence of oropharyngeal colonisation by H influenzae was 16% and was unchanged after operation. S pneumoniae was present in only 5.6 (six patients) before operation and the incidence fell to 1.9% (two patients). There was a transient rise in coliform colonisation postoperatively. Twenty four patients developed a chest infection. In eight a bacterial cause was established, in six H influenzae and in two S pneumoniae. There was a significant relation between the carriage of H influenzae before operation and development of a chest infection. H influenzae was also found more often in cigarette smokers. The presence of S pneumoniae or coliform organisms before surgery was not related to the development of infection. The high incidence of postoperative chest infection in cigarette smokers appears to be due in part to preoperative colonisation of the oropharynx by H influenzae. 
Delayed recovery of muscle pH after short duration, high intensity exercise in malignant hyperthermia susceptible subjects Six subjects susceptible to malignant hyperthermia (MHS) and seven control subjects exercised for 4 min at 120% of their calculated maximal oxygen uptake on a bicycle ergometer. Mean (SEM) muscle pH, measured with a needle-tipped electrode in the vastus lateralis muscle, decreased from a resting value of 7.16 (0.04) to 6.78 (0.04) after exercise in the control group, and from 7.15 (0.05) to 6.56 (0.05) in the MHS group (P less than 0.01 compared with control group). A further decrease in muscle pH to 6.68 (0.06) by 5 min after exercise occurred in the control group, followed by incomplete recovery to 7.06 (0.04) 30 min after exercise. In the MHS group, however, muscle pH decreased to 6.45 (0.05) 5 min after exercise before recovering slowly to only 6.64 (0.07) after 30 min (P less than 0.01 compared with control group). There was no difference in muscle temperature, venous pH or venous lactate concentrations between the two groups. The results show that there is abnormal recovery of muscle pH after short-duration, high-intensity exercise in MHS subjects. 
Cognitive and mood-state changes in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome. In this paper the cognitive and psychiatric impairments associated with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and related disorders are reviewed. It is concluded that while acute mononucleosis and infection with Epstein-Barr virus occasionally result in impaired cognition, such changes have not yet been objectively verified in patients with CFS. However, when patients with CFS are carefully studied, concurrent or premorbid psychiatric disorders are revealed at a greater than chance level. Finally, some suggestions are offered regarding improved neuropsychological assessment of fatigue, concentration, and attention for patients with CFS. The findings to date, while suggesting that psychological predisposition may play a role in the expression of CFS, are still inconclusive regarding the etiology of CFS. 
Fracture line in post head injury optic nerve damage. Diminution of vision following head injuries involving the optic canal is not uncommon. In order to find out how a blunt trauma to the frontotemporal region produced damage to the optic nerve in its canalicular portion, this study was conducted on cadaveric skulls and its results are described. 
Optic neuropathy and central nervous system disease secondary to Sjogren's syndrome in a child. The authors describe a 10-year-old girl in whom optic neuropathy and central nervous system (CNS) disease developed in association with primary Sjogren's syndrome. There was angiographic evidence of cerebral vasculitis and multiple infarcts present on neuroimaging. Results of parotid biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid, and serologic analyses showed abnormalities that were consistent with the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome. Although the patient had optic disc pallor on initial evaluation, her color vision and acuity improved with immunosuppressive therapy, as did her other neurologic symptoms. The authors believe this represents the first reported case of optic neuropathy and CNS disease associated with primary Sjogren's syndrome in the pediatric population. The possibility of improvement in visual function with early institution of immunosuppressive therapy makes prompt diagnosis essential. 
Differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes induced by transfection of ras oncogenes. Mammalian 3T3-L1 cells differentiate into adipocytes after continuous exposure to pharmacological doses of insulin or physiological doses of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1). Expression of transfected ras oncogenes led to differentiation of these cells into adipocytes in the absence of externally added insulin or IGF-I. Cells transfected with normal ras genes or the tyrosine kinase trk oncogene did not differentiate. Transfection with a dominant inhibitory ras mutant resulted in inhibition of differentiation. Exposure of untransfected 3T3-L1 cells to insulin stimulated formation of the active Ras.GTP complex. These observations indicate that Ras proteins participate in signal transduction pathways initiated by insulin and IGF-I in these cells. 
Murine tumor cells transduced with the gene for tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Evidence for paracrine immune effects of tumor necrosis factor against tumors. Studies of the anti-tumor activity of TNF-alpha in vivo have been hampered by the need to administer systemically toxic doses of the cytokine to obtain a curative response. To facilitate studies of the effect of high local concentrations of TNF-alpha on tumor growth and host immunity, a newly induced murine sarcoma was transduced with the gene for human TNF-alpha and the biologic characteristics of these cells were examined. We identified high and low TNF-producing tumor clones which exhibited stable TNF secretion over time. Significant amounts of membrane associated TNF were found in a high-TNF producing clone as well. No difference in the in vitro growth rates between TNF-producing and nonproducing cell lines was observed. In contrast, in vivo studies demonstrate that although unmodified parental tumor cells grew progressively when implanted s.c. in animals, tumor cells transduced with the TNF gene were found to regress in a significant number of animals after an initial phase of growth. This effect correlated with the amount of TNF produced and could be blocked with a specific anti-TNF antibody. Regressions of TNF-producing cells occurred in the absence of any demonstrable toxicity in the animals bearing these tumors. TNF-producing tumor cells could function in a paracrine fashion by inhibiting the growth of unmodified, parental tumor cells implanted at the same site. The ability of tumor cells to regress was abrogated by in vivo depletion of CD4+ or CD8+ T cell subsets and animals that had experienced regression of TNF-producing tumors rejected subsequent challenges of parental tumor. Our studies thus show that tumor cells elaborating high local concentrations of TNF regress in the absence of toxicity in the host and that this process requires the existence of intact host immunity. Studies of the lymphocytes infiltrating the gene modified tumors and attempts to use TNF gene modified tumor infiltrating lymphocytes to deliver high local concentrations of TNF to the tumor site without inducing systemic toxicity are underway. 
Cutaneous manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Part I. The prevalence of dermatologic problems during the course of human immunodeficiency virus infection makes knowledge of these skin manifestations imperative to all practicing dermatologists. Detection of early infection is encouraged as effective therapy now exists both to delay the progression of human immunodeficiency virus-induced immunodeficiency and to prevent opportunistic infections. Skin manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus infection discussed in this article include the following groups: neoplastic, ie, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and squamous cell carcinoma; infectious, ie, viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and arthropod infestations; and a miscellaneous group including papulosquamous, papular, vascular, autoimmune, oral, and drug-related skin disorders. 
Congenital muscular dystrophy: brain alterations in an unselected series of Western patients. The typical form of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) described in Western countries is generally considered different from its Japanese variant because of the absence of CNS involvement. Evaluations from both a clinical and a neuroradiological point of view were made of the CNS functions of 12 unselected Western children affected by CMD. In five patients, clinical observation and intelligence tests showed a mild to severe mental retardation. One of these patients suffered also from a severe form of epilepsy. In the same five patients, various degrees of white matter hypodensity, ventricular enlargement and cerebral atrophy were also detected. Similar neuroradiological abnormalities were also found in five of the seven children who did not have clinical symptoms or signs of CNS involvement. In one of these cases, necropsy neuropathological examination showed the gyral anomalies characteristic of the Japanese type of CMD. This study clearly indicates the high frequency of subclinical CNS alterations in typical Western CMD, suggesting that it should be considered a type of myoencephalopathy like its Japanese counterpart. 
A phase II study of weekly 24-hour infusion with high-dose fluorouracil with leucovorin in colorectal carcinoma. Twenty-two patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma were enrolled in this study. Ten patients had received prior chemotherapy that included the combination of fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV). All patients required subcutaneous port insertion and portable external infusion pumps to allow outpatient treatment. 5-FU (2,600 mg/m2) was administered concurrently with LV (500 mg/m2) over 24 hours of continuous infusion. The mean steady-state plasma concentration of 5-FU was 10 mumol/L (range, 7 to 14 mumol/L). The 5-FU dose was based on our previous phase I study, in which maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of 5-FU was determined to be 2,600 mg/m2 in combination with a fixed dose of LV at 500 mg/m2. The treatment was repeated weekly. Twenty-two patients received a total of 560 courses of treatment. Eleven instances of grade 2-3 toxicity were observed: diarrhea (five), stomatitis (three), hand/foot syndrome (three). The overall objective response was 45% (10 of 22) and among previously untreated patients was 58%. Three of the responders achieved complete response (CR), with lung and liver as the metastatic sites. The median duration of survival for the previously untreated patients was not reached at 22 months, and was 10 months for the previously treated patients. These results suggest that short-term infusional therapy of 5-FU and LV in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer generates acceptable toxicity, with equivalent or superior survivability in previously treated and untreated patients versus alternative methods of administration of the two agents. 
Sulindac causes regression of rectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis. In familial adenomatous polyposis, sulindac-induced polyp regression has been reported by several authors. In this study, the goal was to confirm these results by a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study in 10 patients with rectal polyps that had been previously treated by colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. Patients received sulindac, 300 mg/day, or placebo during two 4-month periods separated by a 1-month wash-out phase. One patient was not compliant and was excluded. With sulindac, the authors observed a complete (6 patients) or almost complete (3 patients) regression of the polyps. With placebo, the authors observed an increase (5 patients), no change (2 patients), and a relative decrease (2 patients) in the number of polyps. The difference between sulindac and placebo was statistically significant (P less than 0.01). In biopsy specimens of polyps and normal rectal mucosa of 6 patients, the authors conducted an immunohistochemical study of the cellular proliferation index using the Ki 67 monoclonal antibody (Ki 67 index), at the beginning and at the end of each treatment period. They were not able to show a sulindac-induced modification of the Ki 67 index. The authors conclude that sulindac is effective in inducing the regression of rectal polyps in familial adenomatous polyposis. 
Adenosine increases sympathetic nerve traffic in humans. BACKGROUND. Adenosine is an effective hypotensive agent in experimental animals and in anesthetized patients, producing little if any evidence of reflex sympathetic activation. In contrast, adenosine increases systolic blood pressure and heart rate in conscious subjects. To determine whether this response is related to sympathetic activation, we studied the cardiovascular and respiratory effects of adenosine in normal subjects while measuring muscle sympathetic nerve traffic through direct recordings from a peroneal nerve. METHODS AND RESULTS. Adenosine (80 micrograms/kg/min i.v.) increased heart rate (+32 +/- 3 beats/min), systolic blood pressure (+10 +/- 2 mm Hg), and minute ventilation (+7 +/- 1 l/min). This was accompanied by a dose-dependent increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (from 198 +/- 52 to 451 +/- 92 units/min). Adenosine also produced a small, but consistent, decrease in diastolic blood pressure (-6 +/- 3 mm Hg). Adenosine produced a greater increase in sympathetic nerve traffic (145 +/- 32% above baseline) than did nitroprusside (65 +/- 16%) at doses that resulted in equivalent decreased in diastolic blood pressure. Arterial baroreceptor unloading, therefore, could not totally explain the increase in sympathetic traffic produced by adenosine. CONCLUSIONS. Given the constellation of findings of increased ventilation and sympathetic activity, we, therefore, propose that adenosine increases sympathetic tone by activating afferent nerves, including arterial chemoreceptors. Contrary to the known inhibitory actions of adenosine on central and peripheral efferent systems, this and other reports suggest that adenosine-induced activation of afferent nerves, leading to sympathetic activation, may be a more widespread phenomenon than previously recognized. 
Development of a new in vivo model for head and neck cancer. We have developed an improved model for studying in vivo nonsurgical treatment of head and neck cancer. In situ oral cavity implantation has been documented, but its natural history is not defined. In light of this, an improved model is described. Forty-two nude mice had tumor cells from one of two established laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines implanted into the floor of the mouth. The tumor mass was measured and followed. When the tumor burden was great enough to cause cachexia, the animals were killed and submitted for microscopic examination. Pulmonary metastases were noted in 44%, bone invasion in 80%, angioinvasion in 76%, and soft tissue invasion in 96% of the animals. Growth characteristics in the head and neck have not been documented in previous models. Our model not only exhibits the locally invasive activity typically associated with malignant neoplasms, but also closely parallels the results of clinical studies examining the percent of end stage patients and autopsies with pulmonary metastases. Therefore, this model should open the way for more meaningful in vivo studies of nonsurgical treatment modalities for both local and metastatic tumor foci in head and neck cancer. 
Cystic duct cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. At present, there is no consensus regarding the routine use of intraoperative cholangiography during cholecystectomy. We describe a reliable technique for performing cystic duct cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Using this technique, we were able to cannulate the cystic duct in 97% of patients, completely visualize the biliary tree and duodenum in 93% of patients, and identify unsuspected choledocholithiasis in 3% of patients. Treatment options for the management of choledocholithiasis demonstrated by cholangiograms during laparoscopic cholecystectomy include conversion to an open cholecystectomy and common duct exploration, or endoscopic sphincterotomy and common duct stone extraction following laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 
Yersinia terminal ileitis: sonographic findings in eight patients. To determine the sonographic features of Yersinia terminal ileitis, we analyzed the sonograms of eight patients with acute terminal ileitis. Bacteriologic or serologic confirmation of Yersinia enterocolitica infection was available in six patients. In the other two, the clinical course and radiologic findings were compatible with the diagnosis. Radiographs and endoscopy showed edematous mucosa with small elevations in the terminal ileum in all the patients. Sonograms showed thickening of the wall of the ileum in all eight patients and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes in six patients. Although the number of the patients is small, our experience suggests that sonography can be useful for the detection of acute terminal ileitis caused by Yersinia. 
Short-term oral zinc supplementation does not improve chronic hepatic encephalopathy. Results of a double-blind crossover trial. The effect of short-term oral zinc supplementation (zinc sulfate 600 mg/day) on hepatic encephalopathy, was assessed in a double-blind, crossover trial. Fifteen cirrhotic patients with stable, chronic hepatic encephalopathy were randomized to receive either oral zinc or a placebo for 10 days. Following a two-week washout period, these were crossed over to the alternate treatment. Conn's index, which comprises the evaluation of the mental state, asterixis, number connection test, EEG record, and plasma ammonia, was used to score the degree of hepatic encephalopathy, both at the beginning and end of each treatment period. Serum zinc was significantly raised after oral zinc administration and reached the levels observed in cirrhotics without hepatic encephalopathy. Despite this, however, no modification in the parameters included in Conn's index were observed. In conclusion, this study failed to confirm that short-term oral zinc supplementation improves chronic hepatic encephalopathy. 
Arthrodesis of the knee with an intramedullary nail. The cases of twenty patients who had an arthrodesis in which an intramedullary nail was used for stabilization were reviewed at an average follow-up of six years. The predominant indications were infection after total knee arthroplasty and post-traumatic pain and instability. Other indications included aseptic loosening of the components of a total knee arthroplasty, reconstruction after resection of a giant-cell tumor, non-union of a fracture of the distal part of the femur or the proximal part of the tibia, and failed external-compression arthrodesis. Success was achieved in seventeen patients (85 per cent), and functional stability immediately postoperatively was gained in all twenty. Of the three patients in whom the arthrodesis failed, all had sustained an intraoperative fracture, and infection eventually developed. Of the twelve nails that were secured to the greater trochanter with a loop of stainless-steel wire, none showed evidence of proximal migration. Of the eight nails that were not thus secured, two migrated proximally, necessitating removal of the nail. Two drawbacks to this operation are the long duration and the large amount of blood that is lost. The major advantage is that a high percentage of patients have progression to a stable fusion despite serious problems. Furthermore, all but seven patients (including the six who had a tumor or who had sustained an intraoperative fracture) were able to bear full weight by the second postoperative week. Only a few patients needed an external support for walking. 
Immunoprecipitation of membrane proteins from rat basophilic leukemia cells by the antiganglioside monoclonal antibody AA4. In previous studies, mAb AA4 inhibited IgE binding, induced rapid morphologic changes, and blocked histamine release in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. It bound to two novel derivatives of ganglioside GD1b (Ag I and Ag II) that appear to be present only in rat mast cells. The present study demonstrates the importance of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II for binding of mAb AA4 to intact cells. We also investigated the presence of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II and proteins immunoprecipitated with mAb AA4 in the parental and four variant cell lines. In comparison with the parental RBL-2H3, two variant cell lines had very low (0.5% and 2.0%) and two others had intermediate levels (9% and 18%) of 125I-AA4 binding. mAb AA4 inhibited 125I-IgE binding to the parental RBL-2H3 cells and to only one variant with intermediate amounts of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II. Therefore, there are variations in the proximity of these gangliosides to the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI) among different cell lines. mAb AA4 immunoprecipitated proteins of 50 to 60, 120, and 135 kDa from 125I-surface labeled cells. These were different from the subunits of Fc epsilon RI. The amount of gangliosides Ag I and Ag II in cell extracts correlated with the number of mAb AA4 binding sites on the cell surface and with the quantity of proteins precipitated from the different cell lines. Thus, these membrane proteins appear to be associated with gangliosides Ag I and Ag II. The binding of mAb AA4 to the surface gangliosides could induce intracellular changes through transmembrane signaling by these proteins. 
Borrelia burgdorferi-associated cutaneous B cell lymphoma: clinical and immunohistologic characterization of four cases. Four patients with low-grade malignant B cell lymphoma of the skin in association with chronic Borrelia burgdorferi infection are presented. Plaque-shaped or nodular erythematous lesions with ill-defined borders were seen. Clinical progression was slow; the skin tumors occurred for up to 7 to 15 years. Extracutaneous involvement was found in only one case. Immunohistologic investigations showed an expression of B cell markers with restriction to only one light chain type and absence of T cell antigens. The growth fraction was 5% to 30%, as shown with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. The immunoarchitecture of the tumors in three patients was unusual compared with established criteria for cutaneous B cell lymphoma and revealed similarities to mucosa-associated B cell lymphoma. Some immunohistologic heterogeneity may indicate the development of monoclonal proliferation that originated from different phases of B lymphocytic differentiation. In three cases no clinical signs of B. burgdorferi infection were found; in one patient acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans was present. The occurrence of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and malignant lymphomas was frequently reported in the European literature before B. burgdorferi was recognized. These findings suggest a relation between B. burgdorferi infection and cutaneous B cell lymphoma. In geographic regions where infected ticks are present, borreliosis should be considered in patients with cutaneous B cell lymphoma. 
Subacute bilateral coronary ostial stenoses following cardiac catheterization and PTCA. Accelerated coronary ostial stenosis is an infrequent late complication of coronary artery catheter instrumentation during aortic valve surgery, PTCA, or coronary angiography. We report the first case of bilateral coronary artery ostial stenoses developing after cardiac catheterization and right coronary artery PTCA. In patients with worsening angina following cardiac catheterization or PTCA, accelerated ostial stenoses should not be over-looked in the differential diagnosis. 
Epileptogenic effect of hypoxia in the immature rodent brain. The response to cerebral hypoxia/ischemia may be different in the neonate compared to other age groups. An in vivo model was developed in the rat to determine whether there are age-dependent differences in the effects of hypoxia on electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. EEG recordings were obtained from Long Evans hooded rats deprived of oxygen at five ages: postnatal days 5 to 7, 10 to 12, 15 to 17, 25 to 27, and 50 to 60. Oxygen concentration was varied from 0, 2, 3, and 4% between animals. EEGs were recorded in all animals before, during, and at 1 hour after exposure to the hypoxic condition and at 1 to 7 days afterward in a subset of animals. All animals were deprived of oxygen until the onset of apnea and bradycardia to 20 to 40% of baseline heart rate values. Hypoxia resulted in isoelectric EEG significantly more frequently in the animals deprived of oxygen at postnatal days 25 to 27 and 50 to 60 than in the younger age groups. A highly significant effect was that the animals deprived at postnatal days 5 to 17 revealed a high incidence of epileptiform EEG activity during hypoxia. In contrast, the older animals exhibited only rare isolated EEG spikes before reaching an isoelectric EEG. The severity of hypoxia-induced epileptiform EEG changes was highest in the animals subjected to moderately hypoxic conditions (3% and 4% oxygen) at postnatal days 10 to 12. Furthermore, epileptiform changes persisted for hours to days following prolonged episodes of hypoxia in the younger animals. This study demonstrates a unique response of the immature brain to exhibit epileptiform activity during hypoxia. 
Endoscopic and videofluoroscopic evaluations of swallowing and aspiration. A new procedure for evaluating oropharyngeal dysphagia utilizing fiberoptic laryngoscopy was compared to the videofluoroscopy procedure. Twenty-one subjects were given both examinations within a 48-hour period. Results of the fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) and videofluoroscopy examinations were compared for presence or absence of abnormal events. Good agreement was found, especially for the finding of aspiration (90% agreement). The FEES was then measured against the videofluoroscopy study for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. Sensitivity was 0.88 or greater for three of the four parameters measured. Specificity was lower overall, but was still 0.92 for detection of aspiration. It was concluded that the FEES is a valid and valuable tool for evaluating oropharyngeal dysphagia. Some specific patients and conditions that lend themselves to this procedure are discussed. 
Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors improve contractile function of stunned myocardium by different mechanisms of action. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors enhance contractile function of myocardium "stunned" by a brief episode of coronary artery occlusion, yet their mechanism(s) of action remain unresolved. In addition to possible hemodynamic effects, ACE inhibitors may stimulate the synthesis of cardioprotective prostaglandins. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of ACE inhibitors that contain a sulfhydryl group may be due in part to the ability of thiol compounds to act as nonspecific antioxidants or direct scavengers of cytotoxic oxygen-derived free radicals. To investigate this question we compared the effects of (1) the sulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor zofenopril, (2) the sulfhydryl-containing stereoisomer of captopril (SQ 14,534) with essentially no ACE inhibitor properties, (3) the nonsulfhydryl-containing ACE inhibitor enalaprilat, and (4) solvent alone, given at the time of reperfusion, on recovery of contractile function after 15 minutes of coronary occlusion in the anesthetized open-chest dog. Segment shortening in control animals remained depressed or "stunned" after reperfusion, recovering to only -5 +/- 12% of baseline preocclusion values at 3 hours after reperfusion. In contrast, all three treatment agents attenuated postischemic dysfunction: segment shortening was restored to 33 +/- 12%, 54 +/- 6%, and 83 +/- 5% of baseline values at 3 hours after reflow in dogs treated with SQ 14,534 (p less than 0.05), zofenopril (p less than 0.01), and enalaprilat (p less than 0.01), respectively (all vs control value). These improvements in segment shortening did not appear to be the result of altered oxygen supply or demand after reperfusion, inasmuch as no significant differences in systemic hemodynamic parameters or myocardial blood flow were observed among the groups. In the second phase of the study, we found that the improved contractile function associated with enalaprilat treatment could largely be reversed by infusion of the potent cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin: segment shortening was reduced from 69 +/- 12% at 2 hours after treatment/reperfusion to 38 +/- 12% at 2 hours after indomethacin infusion (p less than 0.01 vs 2 hours after reperfusion). Infusion of indomethacin had no effect, however, on the improved contractile function associated with zofenopril treatment. We therefore conclude that sulfhydryl- versus nonsulfhydryl-containing agents enhance contractile function of stunned myocardium by different mechanisms of action: enalaprilat attenuates postischemic dysfunction at least in part by a prostaglandin-mediated mechanism, whereas the salutary effects of zofenopril and SQ 14,534 may be due in part to the antioxidant properties of the sulfhydryl moiety. 
Relation between skin cancer and HLA antigens in renal-transplant recipients BACKGROUND. Recipients of renal allografts are at an increased risk for skin cancer. It is also known that recipients who are homozygous for HLA antigens are at an increased risk for certain cancers, as are those who are mismatched with their donors for these antigens. In a case-control study we assessed the relation between skin cancer in renal-transplant recipients and HLA homozygosity and mismatching. METHODS. Of 764 patients who received renal transplants between 1966 and 1988, 66 had squamous-cell carcinoma or basal-cell carcinoma of the skin after transplantation. HLA homozygosity was assessed in all 66 recipients, and HLA mismatching in 39; the results were compared with those in 124 recipients without skin cancer. We also investigated the relation between skin cancer and the use of immunosuppressive drugs. In separate case-control analyses we investigated the influence of exposure to the sun and keratotic skin lesions on the risk of skin cancer. RESULTS. The risk of squamous-cell carcinoma was increased in recipients mismatched for HLA-B antigens; the relative risks were 2.6 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.5) and 5.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.3 to 19.0) with mismatching for one and two antigens, respectively, as compared with no mismatching. Mismatching for HLA-A or HLA-DR antigens had no effect on the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma, and there was no association between mismatches at any of the HLA loci and the occurrence of basal-cell carcinoma. The total doses of azathioprine and prednisone were not associated with the occurrence of skin cancer or with HLA matching. Exposure to sunlight and keratotic skin lesions were strongly associated with skin cancer but not with HLA mismatching. Homozygosity for HLA-DR was more frequent among the patients with squamous-cell carcinoma (relative risk, 2.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.95 to 4.6) and among patients with 100 or more keratotic skin lesions (relative risk, 4.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 15.1). CONCLUSIONS. HLA-B mismatching is significantly associated with the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma in renal-transplant recipients, as is HLA-DR homozygosity. An indirect effect on the level of immunosuppression does not appear to explain these findings, nor does exposure to sunlight or the number of keratotic skin lesions account for this observation. 
The peroxisome and the eye. Several childhood multisystem disorders with prominent ophthalmological manifestations have been ascribed to the malfunction of the peroxisome, a subcellular organelle. The peroxisomal disorders have been divided into three groups: 1) those that result from defective biogenesis of the peroxisome (Zellweger syndrome, neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy, and infantile Refsum's disease); 2) those that result from multiple enzyme deficiencies (rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata); and 3) those that result from a single enzyme deficiency (X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, primary hyperoxaluria type 1). Zellweger syndrome, the most lethal of the three peroxisomal biogenesis disorders, causes infantile hypotonia, seizures, and death within the first year. Ophthalmic manifestations include corneal opacification, cataract, glaucoma, pigmentary retinopathy and optic atrophy. Neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and infantile Refsum's disease appear to be genetically distinct, but clinically, biochemically, and pathologically similar to Zellweger syndrome, although milder. Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata, a peroxisomal disorder which results from at least two peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies, presents at birth with skeletal abnormalities and patients rarely survive past one year of age. The most prominent ocular manifestation consists of bilateral cataracts. X-linked (childhood) adrenoleukodystrophy, results from a deficiency of a single peroxisomal enzyme, presents in the latter part of the first decade with behavioral, cognitive and visual deterioration. The vision loss results from demyelination of the entire visual pathway, but the outer retina is spared. Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 manifests parafoveal subretinal pigment proliferation. Classical Refsum's disease may also be a peroxisomal disorder, but definitive evidence is lacking. Early identification of these disorders, which may depend on recognizing the ophthalmological findings, is critical for prenatal diagnosis, treatment, and genetic counselling. 
Five-hour balloon inflation to resolve recurrent reocclusion during coronary angioplasty [published erratum appears in Cathet Cardiovasc Diagn 1991 May;23(1):71] A 63-year-old male presented with an acute inferior myocardial infarction with initial clinical reperfusion following thrombolysis. Due to recurrent reocclusion, emergency catheterization was performed, demonstrating a 90% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery. Angioplasty was complicated by multiple reocclusions, ultimately requiring 5-h autoperfusion balloon inflation to maintain patency. 
Factors affecting perioperative pulmonary function in acute respiratory failure. To determine the magnitude, duration, and associated factors of perioperative changes in pulmonary function, we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 145 patients who required preoperative mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure before undergoing 200 surgical procedures. Patients were grouped into five pulmonary diagnostic categories: (1) adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (n = 49); (2) pneumonia (n = 20); (3) atelectasis (n = 65); (4) congestive heart failure (n = 11); and (5) acute ventilatory failure (n = 55). Sixty patients underwent intra-abdominal surgery, 135 patients required surgery on the periphery, and five patients had a thoracotomy. For all patients, PaO2/FIO2 declined significantly from 321 mm Hg (mean) preoperatively to 258 mm Hg intraoperatively, and shunt fraction (Qs/QT) increased from 0.16 to 0.23 without a significant change in PaCO2. The magnitude of the increase in Qs/QT did not differ among pulmonary diagnostic groups. Preoperatively, patients undergoing laparotomy had lower PaO2/FIO2 (278 vs 340) and higher Qs/QT (0.19 vs 0.14) than patients requiring surgery on the periphery. Intraoperatively, Qs/QT increased more during abdominal procedures than during peripheral procedures. Intraoperative hypoxemia (PaO2/FIO2 less than 80 mm Hg) occurred during 13 procedures. Hypoxemic patients had a mean increase in Qs/QT of 0.20 (0.25 preoperatively to 0.45 intraoperatively), and a significant increase in PaCO2 from 38 mm Hg to 45 mm Hg intraoperatively). In general, these patients had ARDS (n = 10), sepsis (n = 10), a laparotomy (n = 9), and intraoperative mechanical ventilation via the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator (n = 8), a commonly used operating room ventilator. Their preoperative peak airway pressure (54 cm H2O) and minute ventilation (20 L/min) requirements exceeded the capabilities of the Ohio Anesthesia ventilator and likely contributed to impaired gas exchange intraoperatively. Within the first several hours postoperatively, PaO2/FIO2 recovered to preoperative levels in all patients, even in those who had severe intraoperative hypoxemia develop and who underwent laparotomy. We conclude that most patients with acute respiratory failure receiving preoperative mechanical ventilation experienced mild-to-moderate deterioration in intraoperative pulmonary oxygen exchange that rapidly returned to preoperative levels after surgery. We recommend that necessary surgery not be postponed by concern that pulmonary function will be worsened by surgery and anesthesia. 
Factors relevant to preventing embolic stroke in patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation. Whether or not to treat patients with non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation with anticoagulants to prevent embolic stroke is a dilemma for physicians. If randomized trials, currently underway, demonstrate a beneficial effect, the dilemma will not be solved because not all of the relevant factors can be addressed by trials. We used current knowledge about non-rheumatic atrial fibrillation and a method of obtaining patient-derived weights for avoiding stroke from eight medically trained subjects, to determine the overall benefit of anticoagulants and to see what factors were relevant and what effect each might have in deciding whether to use anticoagulant therapy. Using standard assumptions, anticoagulants gave an expected benefit for all subjects. The expected benefit (expressed in terms of lives per 1000 saved due to anticoagulants) varied between 5.4 and 46.7. This benefit remained for all subjects when we did a sensitivity analysis for different rates of stroke prevented by anticoagulants and different rates of intracranial hemorrhage caused by anticoagulants. When we used different baseline rates of stroke and different impacts of major hemorrhagic complications the benefit disappeared for 3 and 4 subjects respectively. We found the factors that were most crucial to the decision will not be included in randomized trials; the weight that an individual would place on avoiding embolic stroke vs the risk of intracranial bleeding from anticoagulant therapy; and the rate of embolic stroke that could be expected for the subject at risk. Factors which will be measured in randomized trials, will change results less substantially: the increased risk of major hemorrhages; the proportion of strokes that could be prevented by treatment; the increase in risk of intracranial hemorrhage. This method of analysis suggests that for most patients anticoagulants are beneficial and that the most important factor in determining this result is the value that subjects put on different outcomes. 
Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia in association with a myocardial bridge. Sustained ventricular tachycardia induced by exercise is uncommon. This is a report of a patient who has a positive exercise test at a high level of exercise. The electrocardiogram has classic ischemic ST depressions. Following the appearance of these ST depressions, the patient developed ventricular tachycardia at a rapid rate. Workup that included an echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization revealed myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending artery as the only structural abnormality. Electrophysiologic studies revealed the patient to have ventricular tachycardia only with isoproterenol (Isuprel) infusion. 
The opacity of portal hypertension-related ascites correlates with the fluid's triglyceride concentration. To determine if an elevated triglyceride concentration can explain the opacity of some cirrhotic ascites specimens, the authors measured triglyceride concentration by Coulter DACOS (Hialeah, FL) on 133 paired serum and ascitic fluid specimens. The specimens were categorized as clear or cloudy by coded visual inspection. In addition, the ascitic fluid specimens were inspected for a lipid supernatant after 48 hours of refrigeration at 4 degrees C. The ascitic fluid triglyceride concentration of the 87 clear specimens was 1.9 +/- 1.0 mmol/L compared with 7.0 +/- 4.6 mmol/L for the opalescent specimens (P less than 0.001). Only 17% of the clear specimens demonstrated any lipid layer after refrigeration, compared with 94% of opalescent specimens (P less than 0.001). The triglyceride concentrations were not significantly different between the serum samples obtained from patients with clear compared with opalescent ascites. The opacity of portal hypertension-related ascites appears to be related to the triglyceride concentration of the fluid.
