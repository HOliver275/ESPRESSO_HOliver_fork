1	The growing teratoma syndrome. Thirteen patients with metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumours and enlarging metastases consisting of teratoma differentiated only were identified. Patients were managed with surgical resection soon after the growing lesions were documented. Surgical morbidity was minimal and 12 patients are alive (10 are disease-free) at a median follow-up of 28 months. 
3	Intradural herniation of a thoracic disc presenting as flaccid paraplegia: case report. A case of intradural herniation of a thoracic disc in a patient with a flaccid paraplegia is described. Intradural herniation of a thoracic disc is considered a rare event. A review of the relevant patient literature revealed 14 other reports involving 28 patients. No other report has described a patient with an intradural thoracic disc herniation who developed a flaccid paraplegia. 
5	Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a fungal aneurysm of the vertebral artery as a complication of intracranial aneurysm clipping. Case report. Intracranial aneurysms are an uncommon manifestation of fungal infection. A case is described in which the formation of an aneurysm followed an intracranial intraoperative Aspergillus infection attributable to a long period of preoperative antibiotic medication and immunosuppressive therapy with steroids. 
1	Diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia by ultrastructural examination of exfoliative cytologic specimens. Lingual exfoliative cytologic specimens (scrapings) were obtained from 18 patients positive for human immunodeficiency virus with clinical oral hairy leukoplakia. Buccal mucosal scrapings were obtained from 12 of these patients. The specimens were processed for examination by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Sixteen (89%) of the lingual specimens revealed infection of keratinocytes by herpes-type virus. There was no evidence of virus infection in the 12 buccal mucosal scrapings. Fungal hyphae were seen by TEM in 14 (78%) of the lingual scrapings and two (17%) of the buccal scrapings. One exfoliative specimen and two biopsy specimens were stained for Epstein-Barr virus DNA with a DNA probe. The demonstration of herpes-type virions by TEM in keratinocytes from a lesion clinically suspected to be hairy leukoplakia provides direct, objective diagnosis. Furthermore, use of exfoliative cytologic specimens provides a clinically simple, noninvasive technique. 
4	Role of basic fibroblast growth factor in vascular lesion formation. In the present study we investigated whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) plays a role in the proliferative response of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) to denuding injury. Rat carotid smooth muscle was found to express the mRNA for bFGF, and bFGF protein was found to be present in rat aorta by immunoblot analysis. Systemically administered bFGF was a potent mitogen for vascular SMCs in arteries denuded with a balloon catheter, increasing replication from 11.5% in controls to 54.8%. Denudation with a device (filament loop), which causes only minimal damage to medial SMCs, showed a similar increase in replication (1.3% versus 43.3%) after bFGF infusion. In unmanipulated vessels, however, SMCs were unresponsive to infused bFGF. Infusion of a "mitotoxin" (bFGF conjugated to saporin) caused a greater than 50% decrease in the number of viable SMCs in the arterial wall after balloon injury. Prolonged administration of bFGF (12 micrograms/day for 2 weeks) after balloon injury caused an approximately twofold increase in intimal thickening. These results show that bFGF, which is synthesized by the arterial wall, could be a potent mitogen for SMCs in vivo and suggest that any release of endogenous bFGF may be capable of stimulating SMC proliferation, which may subsequently lead to intimal lesion formation. 
5	Immunization and protection against malaria during murine pregnancy. Normal and immune mice were evaluated for their ability to resist infection to the rodent malaria parasite, Plasmodium yoelii, during pregnancy. Parasitemia levels were slightly higher and time-to-death shorter in the nonimmunized pregnant group infected with virulent parasites relative to virgin controls. Subinoculation experiments revealed that numerous virulent organisms were present in the placentas of unprotected gravida but were absent from the fetal livers of their conceptuses. It was also found that mice preimmunized with irradiated P. yoelii survived a usually lethal challenge infection during mid-gestation and delivered healthy newborns. Associated with this protection against transplacental spread of parasites was the additional key finding that placental macrophages were as effective as peritoneal exudate cells in phagocytosing parasite derived material in vitro. This murine malaria-pregnancy model should provide new insights on the various factors (virulence, immunogenicity) of microbial infections affecting the fetal-maternal relationship, as well as on the expression of immune effector mechanisms and immunoregulation, during the reproductive process. 
2	Occupational distribution of inflammatory bowel disease among German employees. Previous reports have shown that both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis affect people in white collar occupations associated with higher income and higher social class more frequently than other groups in the population. This study sought to carry these analyses one step further and investigate the distribution of inflammatory bowel disease by individual occupations. The German social security statistics for 'rehabilitation' were used to assess the occupational distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. From 1982 to 1988, a total of 12,014 people were granted rehabilitation as a result of inflammatory bowel disease. Low male prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease was found among bricklayers, road construction workers, unskilled workers in brick and stone, unskilled labourers, and security personnel. Low rates were found among women employed in cleaning and maintenance, and in those without occupation. In contrast, a high male prevalence was found among instrument makers, electricians, bakers, and technical assistants. Among female employees, inflammatory bowel disease was significantly associated with sales representatives, office workers, health occupations, and hairdressers. These associations were found in the complete data for 1982-8 as well as in the separate data for the two half periods 1982-5 and 1986-8. Highly significant correlations between the occupational distribution of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis were found among both male and female employees. It seems that occupations involving work in the open air and physical exercise are protective, while being exposed to air conditioned artificial working conditions or extended and irregular shift working confer a risk of contracting inflammatory bowel disease. 
1	Effect of dietary calcium on colon carcinogenesis induced by a single injection of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine in rats. The purpose of this study was to determine if high levels of dietary calcium could inhibit the induction of colon tumors in rats injected with a single dose of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH). Rats were given a single subcutaneous injection of DMH (200 mg/kg body weight) 2 wk before they were fed purified diets containing 5% fat and four different levels of calcium (as calcium gluconate). After 8 mo, the following incidences of colon tumors (total) were seen: 0.2% Ca, 56%; 0.5% Ca [National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) recommended level], 75%; 1.0% Ca, 61%; 2.0% Ca, 41%. Thus, rats fed calcium at levels above or below the NAS/NRC recommendation had lower tumor incidences. The total tumor incidence and the incidence of adenocarcinomas (with or without invasion) were not significantly affected by calcium, but the incidences of benign adenomatous polyps and of distal colon tumors were significantly affected. Autoradiographic examination of [3H]thymidine-treated rats revealed that the level of calcium did not significantly alter the cell kinetic indices in the distal colon. In the proximal colon, however, the 0.2% Ca group had a significantly larger proliferative zone, with significantly more labeled cells present at the bottom of the colon crypt. Mineral analysis of tibias and serum samples revealed that rats fed higher levels of calcium had lower bone Fe and serum Mg contents, but no significant trends were seen for Ca, P, Zn or Cu. Therefore, increasing or decreasing the calcium content above or below the NAS/NRC recommendation (supplemented to low fat diets) during the promotional phase of colon carcinogenesis altered the tumor incidence, but the effect was confined to the distal colon and to benign adenomatous polyps. 
5	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in association with L-tryptophan ingestion. The association between the recently described eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and L-tryptophan is now well established. We describe a patient with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome who developed incapacitating myalgias and peripheral eosinophilia responsive only to high dose corticosteroids. When massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage developed while receiving corticosteroid therapy, surgery was complicated by striking abdominal wall rigidness. A discussion of this case and of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is presented. 
1	Fertility-sparing treatment of patients with ovarian cancer. The variety of malignant neoplasms produced by the ovary are legion. Each must be considered individually in the young woman with early disease who wishes to preserve her childbearing capability. The risks of conservative surgery are often low, and the patient can be so advised. Careful monitoring of this group of patients is essential regardless of the approach. 
1	Liver transplant for metastatic neuroendocrine tumor. Generally, the results of liver transplantation for metastatic liver disease have not been favorable. One exception has been the unique group of neuroendocrine tumors, the slow growth of which allows liver transplantation to effectively palliate and control symptoms. We report two cases: (a) A 51-year-old man who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation and resection of the pancreatic primary tumor for a nonfunctioning malignant neuroendocrine tumor with features of both carcinoid and islet-cell glucagonoma remains symptom-free and without evidence of tumor recurrence at 13 months follow-up. (b) A 47-year-old man who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation and Whipple resection for a metastatic islet-cell tumor in the head of the pancreas is fully recovered at 5 months follow-up. 
3	The effects of sucralfate suspension and diphenhydramine syrup plus kaolin-pectin on radiotherapy-induced mucositis. A prospective, double-blind study compared the effectiveness of sucralfate suspension with diphenhydramine syrup plus kaolin-pectin in reducing severity and pain of radiation-induced oropharyngeal mucositis. Fourteen patients who received at least 4600 cGy to the oral cavity used one of the mouth rinses four times a day, beginning at 1600 cGy. Data were collected on daily perceived pain and helpfulness of mouth rinse, weekly mucositis grade, weight change, and interruption of therapy. Analysis of data revealed no statistically significant differences between the two groups in any parameter. A retrospective review of 15 patients who had received at least 4600 cGy radiation to the oropharynx but had not used a daily mouth-coating rinse, was compared with the study group. Comparison of the two groups suggested that consistent daily oral hygiene and use of a mouth-coating agent will result in less pain and may reduce weight loss and interruption of radiation because of severe mucositis. 
5	Respiratory arrest in near-fatal asthma BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The majority of asthma-related deaths occur outside the hospital, and therefore the exact factors leading to the terminal event are difficult to ascertain. To examine the mechanisms by which patients might die during acute exacerbations of asthma, we studied 10 such patients who arrived at the hospital in respiratory arrest or in whom it developed soon (within 20 minutes) after admission. RESULTS. The characteristics of the group were similar to those associated in the literature with a high risk of death from asthma, including a long history of the disease in young to middle-aged patients, previous life-threatening attacks or hospitalizations, delay in obtaining medical aid, and sudden onset of a rapidly progressive crisis. Extreme hypercapnia (mean [+/- SD] partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, 97.1 +/- 31.1 mm Hg) and acidosis (mean [+/- SD] pH, 7.01 +/- 0.11) were found before mechanical ventilation was begun, and four patients had hypokalemia on admission. Despite the severe respiratory acidosis, no patient had a serious cardiac arrhythmia during the resuscitation maneuvers or during hospitalization. We observed systemic hypertension and sinus tachycardia in eight patients, atrial fibrillation in one, and sinus bradycardia in another. In both patients with arrhythmia the heart reverted to sinus rhythm immediately after manual ventilation with 100 percent oxygen was begun. The median duration of mechanical ventilation was 12 hours, and all patients had normocapnia on discharge from the hospital. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that at least in this group of patients, the near-fatal nature of the exacerbations was the result of severe asphyxia rather than cardiac arrhythmias. These results suggest that undertreatment rather than overtreatment may contribute to an increase in mortality from asthma. 
5	Orbital volume augmentation with adjustable prefabricated methylmethacrylate subperiosteal implants. Prefabricated right and left subperiosteal implants were used in nine anophthalmic sockets to correct superior sulcus deformities. The advantages of these implants include increased stability, easy insertion under direct visualization and the possibility of easy retrieval if necessary, and custom modification for volume and shape intraoperatively, with the addition of methylmethacrylate. There were no extrusions, implant migrations, or infections. Complications included mild undercorrection, upper eyelid blepharoptosis, and transient ectropion. 
5	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan: muscle biopsy findings in 4 patients. Muscle biopsies of 4 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan showed lymphocytic infiltrates with occasional eosinophils largely restricted to interstitial fibrous tissue and perivascular areas. There was inflammation and fibrosis of muscle spindle capsules in 3 patients. In the 2 sickest patients, there was profound muscle atrophy, affecting both muscle fiber types. 
5	Bone lysis in well-fixed cemented femoral components. We have reviewed 25 cases of focal femoral osteolysis in radiographically stable, cemented femoral implants. In three hips retrieved at post-mortem from two patients, we have been able to make a detailed biomechanical and histological analysis. The interval between arthroplasty and the appearance of focal osteolysis on clinical radiographs ranged from 40 to 168 months, and in over 70% of the cases this did not appear until after five or more years. Few had significant pain and there was no relation to age, sex or original diagnosis. The most common site for osteolysis were Gruen zones 2 and 3 on the anteroposterior radiograph and zones 5 and 6 on the lateral radiograph. In 15 cases (60%), the area of osteolysis corresponded to either a defect in the cement mantle or an area of very thin cement. The rate of progression of these lesions was variable, but to date only one has progressed to gross loosening of the femoral component. The back-scatter scanning electron microscopic examination of serial sections and biomechanical testing of the post-mortem specimens demonstrated focal cement fracture around implants that were otherwise rigidly fixed. In eight cases from which tissue was available, histology showed a histiocytic reaction with evidence of particulate polymethylmethacrylate. We consider that this local fragmentation was the stimulus for local osteolysis in an otherwise stable cemented femoral component. 
3	Hippocampal sclerosis in temporal lobe epilepsy demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging. The value of magnetic resonance imaging in the detection of hippocampal sclerosis has been controversial. We studied 10 patients aged 22.5 +/- 6.0 years with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy selected because of a history of a prolonged childhood convulsion, which is characteristic of a group of patients in whom hippocampal sclerosis is a constant finding. All 10 patients showed reduction in size of one hippocampus associated with increased signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. These changes were reliably detected on coronal spin-echo images, perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus. Appreciation of the normal imaging anatomy of the hippocampus allowed correct interpretation of the relative changes in signal intensities of the hippocampus and adjacent temporal horn on sequential echo images. The side of the abnormal hippocampus on magnetic resonance imaging accorded with the electroencephalographic localization in all 10 patients, and with the lateralization of the early convulsions in all 6 patients where this was known. Temporal lobectomy was performed in all 10 patients. Hippocampal sclerosis was confirmed in the 3 patients in whom hippocampal tissue was available for histological examination. The value of this technique was reinforced by the excellent postoperative results, with 80% being seizure free at a mean follow-up time of 33 +/- 4 months. 
5	Retroperitoneal mobilization of the vas deferens in the complex vasovasostomy. Anatomic distances along retroperitoneal, inguinal, and infrainguinal segments of the vas deferens were measured in 14 formalin fixed cadavers and in 15 recently postmortem males. There were no significant differences in segment lengths between the two groups nor between the right and left vasa. Data from the recent postmortem group reveals a mean length of 5.83 +/- .65 cm to be gained from retroperitoneal mobilization of the vas deferens. This information is important to surgical decisions in cases of microsurgical repair of obstructive azoospermia resulting from damage to the inguinal segment of the vas deferens. Data on other vasal segment lengths is beneficial for planning repair in other complex cases of obstructive azoospermia as well. 
2	Ten years' experience with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Up to January 1989, 171 patients were trained at our center on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and 17 on continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). Over 10 years, we have gained 5,068 patient-months experience. Patient survival was 60% and 31% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. In contrast, diabetics had a survival of 32% at 5 years. Major complications included 499 new episodes of peritonitis, 304 exit-site infections, 22 hernias, five bowel perforations, one hydrothorax, and three episodes of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis. Our technique survival has been 62% and 40% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. We believe that CAPD is a viable dialysis technique for long-term treatment of chronic renal failure and it should be offered as an option to intermittent hemodialysis. 
5	Ontogenetic features of audiogenic seizure susceptibility induced in immature rats by noise. Although numerous models are currently used for systematic study of the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in mature brain, few animal models have been developed that allow similar explorations in the developing nervous system. One experimental model of epilepsy supports a premise that perinatal experience can lead to eventual seizure susceptibility, however. Audiogenic seizure (AGS) susceptibility can be induced during a critical developmental period in normal mice by auditory deprivation and therefore by cochlear trauma. We studied the developmental parameters that affect success of both induction and testing of AGS-susceptibility in the rat. Intense high-frequency noise exposure was used as the traumatizing agent. The Wistar rat strain used is inherently seizure-resistant because in greater than 400 trials, untreated rats have never exhibited susceptibility at any age. Although single prolonged exposures to high-intensity noise were administered to groups of rats at ages between postnatal days (PNDs) 12 and 36, PND 14 was the age when exposure was most likely to result in eventual seizure susceptibility. Furthermore, duration of initial exposure on PND 14 determined the rate of susceptibility when measured 2 weeks later. Accordingly, we noted that single noise exposures at an intensity of 125 dB and ranging between 6 and 10 min in duration induced susceptibility in 100% of rats tested on PND 28; nonetheless, seizures among the rats exposed for 8 min were the most severe. Typically, these seizures began as wild running attacks and were followed by tonic/clonic convulsions. 
1	Response of oral leukoplakia to beta-carotene. Leukoplakia is associated with increased risk of oral cancer and is considered a premalignant lesion. Retinoids, particularly 13-cis retinoic acid, can frequently reverse leukoplakia. However, these drugs have considerable toxicity and are not suitable for large-scale use in the prevention of oral cancer. Beta-carotene is a naturally occurring, nontoxic carotenoid with biologic properties that suggest that it might be efficacious against oral leukoplakia. In 1986, we began a randomized study of 13-cis retinoic acid (1 mg/kg/d) versus beta-carotene (30 mg/d) in leukoplakia. However, owing to the marked differences in toxicity between the two compounds outlined in the consent form, 11 of the initial 16 eligible patients refused to participate unless they were "guaranteed" beta-carotene. Therefore, the study design was changed to a phase II trial of beta-carotene in which the compound was given daily for 3 months. Responding patients were continued for another 3 months of treatment. All lesions were examined histologically at entry. Responses were monitored by bidimensional measurements and photography done at entry, then monthly while on treatment and at study completion. Twenty-four evaluable patients were treated, and 17 had major responses (two complete, 15 partial), a response rate of 71% (95% confidence limits, 53% to 89%). There was no significant toxicity requiring drug discontinuation or dose reduction. These results indicate that beta-carotene has substantial activity in oral premalignancy. Because of its lack of toxicity, it is an excellent candidate for a preventive agent for oral cancer. 
4	Nitrous oxide does not exacerbate pulmonary hypertension or ventricular dysfunction in patients with mitral valvular disease Using the rapid-response thermistor pulmonary artery catheter and transoesophageal echocardiography, this study examined the effects of 100 per cent oxygen, 70 per cent nitrous oxide/30 per cent oxygen, and 70 per cent nitrogen/30 per cent oxygen on the pulmonary circulation and ventricular function in ten patients with pulmonary hypertension. In comparison with baseline measurements, nitrous oxide administration resulted in small but statistically significant (P less than 0.05) changes in mean arterial pressure (76 +/- 14 to 67 +/- 12), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (37 +/- 14 to 33 +/- 13 mmHg), and cardiac output (3.7 +/- 1.4 to 3.2 +/- 1.1 L.min-1). Seventy per cent nitrogen resulted in no significant changes from baseline. The repeat 100 per cent oxygen measurements were nearly identical to the nitrous oxide measurements. It is concluded that nitrous oxide does not exacerbate pulmonary hypertension or ventricular dysfunction during high-dose fentanyl anaesthesia in patients with mitral valvular disease. 
5	Gastric epithelium in the duodenum: its association with Helicobacter pylori and inflammation. Duodenal biopsy specimens from 471 adults and 47 children were examined to determine the prevalence and distribution of gastric epithelium in the duodenal bulb in relation to age, gender, gastroduodenal inflammation, smoking, alcohol and consumption of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Gastric metaplasia was present in the anterior wall duodenal biopsy specimen in 31%, was significantly less common in patients under 17 than in adults, and was more common in males than females. In sixty two adults who underwent multiple radial duodenal biopsy gastric metaplasia was randomly distributed around the duodenal circumference; sixty three per cent of the patients with gastric metaplasia found on multiple biopsy were detected by just the anterior biopsy. Gastric metaplasia was not obviously associated with alcohol, cigarette, or NSAID consumption. While the presence of gastric metaplasia was associated with adulthood, male sex, and low fasting gastric juice pH, its extent was associated with active duodenitis and Helicobacter-associated gastritis. On logistic regression, gastric metaplasia in the duodenum and gastric Helicobacter pylori were independent predictors of active duodenitis, but were not significantly associated with inactive duodenal inflammation. H pylori was observed in duodenal biopsy specimens from 32 patients, all with active duodenitis; bacteria were present only on foci of gastric metaplasia, and were more likely to be seen when the metaplasia was extensive. It is proposed that inflammatory injury to the duodenal mucosa by H pylori may stimulate the development of further gastric metaplasia, and that the area of duodenum susceptible to colonisation with H pylori may therefore increase progressively until mucosal integrity is compromised and ulceration supervenes. 
2	Palliation of malignant esophageal obstruction. Progressive dysphagia is common in patients with advanced esophageal carcinoma. Multiple nonsurgical techniques are available to provide palliation and improved nutrition. Simple dilatation is the oldest technique and newer methods may offer greater efficacy. Laser therapy now provides an excellent opportunity to treat obstructing tumors. Placement of an esophageal prosthesis may become particularly useful when dilatation must be performed too frequently or has become ineffective or in the patient with an esophageal-pulmonary fistula. Newer techniques including BICAP tumor probe, intracavitary radiotherapy, or absolute alcohol injection offer promise. This review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these different palliative techniques for patients with the extremely poor prognosis associated with esophageal cancer. 
1	Nutritional approach to cancer prevention with emphasis on vitamins, antioxidants, and carotenoids. The main human cancers are associated with complex life-style related causative, enhancing, and inhibiting factors. Tobacco smoking or chewing exposes humans to genotoxic carcinogens and to promoting substances. Likewise, Western dietary traditions involve certain carcinogens and promoters, whereas Oriental traditions implicate other carcinogens and promoters. Importantly, in virtually all situations regular intake of fruits and vegetables appreciably lowers the risk of cancer. This paper reviews the causes of the main human cancers and analyzes the mechanisms of the protective effects of fruits and vegetables. Prevention of human cancer requires the definition of optimal levels of recommended daily allowances of micronutrients. 
4	Thromboxane receptor blockade prevents pulmonary hypertension induced by heparin-protamine reactions in awake sheep We used competitive thromboxane A2-prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor blockade (SQ 30,741) as a probe to evaluate the role of thromboxane in ovine pulmonary vasoconstriction associated with protamine reversal of heparin anticoagulation. Control heparin-protamine reactions induced rapid release of thromboxane into arterial plasma (more than 1 ng/ml plasma), a 2.5-fold increase of pulmonary artery pressure, a 20% decrease of PaO2, and a 30% reduction in arterial white blood cell concentration. After giving SQ 30,741 despite similar thromboxane release into arterial plasma after heparin-protamine challenge, acute pulmonary hypertension was significantly reduced when 94% of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle thromboxane receptors were occupied with SQ 30,741 (p less than 0.01 at 1 minute after protamine versus control heparin-protamine reaction) and was completely abolished by a 10 mg/kg i.v. bolus (p less than 0.0001 at 1 minute after protamine versus control). Peripheral leukopenia was not affected by SQ 30,741 prophylaxis, but hypoxemia was prevented. We conclude that thromboxane causes pulmonary vasoconstriction in ovine heparin-protamine-induced pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary vasoconstriction and hypoxemia can be completely prevented by thromboxane receptor blockade. 
4	Hypoxic acidemia, hyperviscosity, and maternal hypertension do not affect the umbilical arterial velocity waveform in fetal sheep. The effect of hypoxic acidemia, hyperviscosity, and maternal hypertension on the umbilical arterial velocity waveform was studied in 23 chronically catheterized fetal sheep. Fetal hypoxic acidemia induced by lowering the maternal inspired oxygen concentration (n = 7) caused no change in the ratio of systolic/diastolic blood velocity even when fetal arterial pH was as low as 6.8. Fetal blood hyperviscosity (n = 7) induced by exchange transfusion with packed maternal blood cells increased placental vascular resistance by greater than or equal to 50% but had no significant effect on the systolic/diastolic ratio. Similarly, maternal hypertension induced by intravenous infusion of angiotensin II to the ewe (n = 9) did not affect the systolic/diastolic ratio despite a 50% increase in maternal arterial blood pressure. We conclude that umbilical arterial velocity waveform abnormalities observed in growth-restricted human fetuses are probably not a direct result of fetal hypoxemia or hyperviscosity or maternal hypertension. 
4	The effects of generation and gender on the joint distributions of lipid and apolipoprotein phenotypes in the population at large. The generation and gender effects on the joint distributions of total plasma cholesterol (Total-C), ln triglycerides (lnTrig), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), apolipoproteins AI (Apo AI), AII (Apo AII), and E (lnApo E) were studied in 184 male grandparents (MGP), 242 female grandparents (FGP), 237 male parents (MP), 235 female parents (FP), 202 male children (MC), and 200 female children (FC). Homogeneity of variance tests revealed that lipid variances were gender and/or generation specific while apolipoprotein variances were homogeneous across strata. In the absence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity in LDL:lnTrig and lnTrig:Apo AII covariation was found between genders in the parental generation. In the presence of heterogeneity of variance, significant heterogeneity of correlation between genders and/or across generations was found for the HDL-C:LDL-C, Total-C:LDL-C, Total-C:lnTrig, lnTrig:LDL-C, Total-C:lnApo E and HDL-C:lnApo E bivariate distributions. Analyses of principal components revealed that the generation and gender specific cohorts have similar eigenvalues but distinct eigenvectors for the first two principal components underlying the seven dimensional lipid and apolipoprotein distribution. We conclude that the amount of variability explained by the first two principal components is the same across cohorts but how the interindividual variability is distributed among the lipid and apolipoprotein traits is generation and gender specific. This study documents the role that variance and covariance might play in determining risk of disease for special subgroups of the population at large. It also demonstrates how variances and covariances between risk factors traits characterize life processes of aging and sexual dimorphism. This study argues that future biometrical genetic and epidemiological studies of coronary artery disease must take into account age and gender effects on interindividual variability and covariability of risk factors. 
5	Progressive hemolytic anemia due to delayed recognition of a Beall mitral valve prosthesis. In addition to a working knowledge of general complications such as thromboembolism and infective endocarditis, optimal care of the patient with a prosthetic valve requires specific knowledge concerning the characteristics of a given patient's prosthesis. This may need to include the ability to identify the valve roentgenographically when history and records are unavailable. A 53-year-old woman with mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease and status post a reported Bjork-Shiley mitral valve (MV) replacement 17 years prior to hospital admission was referred for evaluation of severe hemolytic anemia. Previous cinefluoroscopy in 1986 at the time of a cerebrovascular accident revealed a normally functioning caged disc prosthesis and not the tilting disc of a Bjork-Shiley prosthetic valve. The valve was not further characterized and she continued receiving warfarin therapy until May 1989 when she presented with laboratory findings showing a marked hemolytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 6.5 mg/dl and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) value of 2100 IU. Echocardiography revealed normal valvular function without evidence of perivalvular leak. The patient was referred for further evaluation with chest roentgenogram at the time of hospital admission revealing a valve configuration characteristic of the Beall model 103/104 series that has been found to manifest progressive disc variance with a high degree of hemolytic anemia (despite normal noninvasive evaluation of MV function), disc tilting with intermittent regurgitation, and catastrophic disc embolization in extreme cases. The precise identification of valvular prosthesis in patients after valve replacement is crucial for optimal management. As in our case, the mere identification of a particular valve may necessitate certain management and therapy based on the natural history of that valve. In the absence of reliable history and/or records, the roentgenographic examination should lead to the precise identification. 
1	Concurrent intradural and extradural meningiomas of the cervical spine. A case of an extradural spinal meningioma presenting with a separate intradural meningioma at the same cord level is reported. Review of the English literature on spinal epidural meningiomas reveals a high incidence of concurrent intradural tumors in patients with epidural meningiomas. This leads to the conclusion that the intradural space should be evaluated carefully when an epidural meningioma is encountered. 
5	Differential regulation of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs): a specific regulatory element in HIV-2 responds to stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor. The human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) types 1 and 2 have similar genetic organization but differ significantly in nucleic acid sequence. Although infection by either agent leads to symptoms of immunodeficiency, recent studies suggest potential differences in the time course and severity of these diseases. In this report, the transcriptional regulation and induction of these retroviruses were analyzed. We report that the regulation of HIV-2 differs from that of HIV-1: a distinct T-cell activation pathway, triggering of the CD3 component of the T-cell receptor complex, stimulates HIV-2 but not HIV-1 gene expression. The response to T-cell receptor stimulation in HIV-2 is mediated partly by an upstream regulatory element, termed CD3R, which is recognized by a sequence-specific DNA binding protein, NF-CD3R. Jurkat T leukemia cell lines containing HIV-2 provirus also showed increased viral replication after stimulation of the T-cell receptor complex, in contrast to HIV-1. These findings suggest that transcriptional regulation and induction of HIV-2 differ from HIV-1 and raise the possibility that different cofactors contribute to the activation of HIV-1- and HIV-2-associated AIDS. 
1	Interstitial chemotherapy with drug polymer implants for the treatment of recurrent gliomas. Malignant gliomas have been difficult to treat with chemotherapy. The most effective agent, BCNU (carmustine), has considerable systemic toxicity and a short half-life in serum. To obviate these problems, a method has been developed for the local sustained release of chemotherapeutic agents by their incorporation into biodegradable polymers. Implantation of the drug-impregnated polymer at the tumor site allows prolonged local exposure with minimal systemic exposure. In this Phase I-II study, 21 patients with recurrent malignant glioma were treated with BCNU released interstitially by means of a polyanhydride biodegradable polymer implant. Up to eight polymer wafers were placed in the resection cavity intraoperatively, upon completion of tumor debulking. The polymer releases the therapeutic drug for approximately 3 weeks. Three increasing concentrations of BCNU were studied; the treatment was well tolerated at all three levels. There were no adverse reactions to the BCNU wafer treatment itself. The average survival period after reoperation was 65 weeks for the first dose group, 64 weeks for the second dose group, and 32 weeks for the highest dose group. The overall mean survival time was 48 weeks from reoperation and 94 weeks from the original operation. The overall median survival times were 46 weeks postimplant and 87 weeks from initial surgery. Eighteen (86%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year from the time of their initial diagnosis and eight (38%) of 21 patients lived more than 1 year after intracranial implantation of the polymer. Frequent hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis tests did not reveal any systemic effect from this interstitial chemotherapy. Since the therapy is well tolerated and safe, a placebo-controlled clinical trial has been started. The trial will measure the effect of the second treatment dose on survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma. 
1	Angiosarcoma of the uterus: a case report. We are reporting a case of angiosarcoma of the uterus in which the diagnosis was confirmed ultrastructurally by demonstration of Weibel-Palade bodies in the tumor cells. Only 10 cases of this entity have been previously documented in the literature. 
5	The impact of right ventricular infarction on the prevalence of ventricular arrhythmias during acute inferior myocardial infarction. To determine the impact of RV infarction on the prevalence and complexity of ventricular arrhythmias during inferior AMI, 57 patients with no prior MI were studied by 24-hour Holter monitoring on the first and tenth days of AMI. Based on radionuclear studies, patients were allocated into two groups: (1) group A, 21 patients (37 percent) with normal RVEF (greater than or equal to 40 percent); and (2) group B, 36 patients (63 percent) with depressed RVEF (less than 40 percent). There were no significant differences between the groups regarding age and LVEF. Values of RVEF were 47 +/- 6 percent and 31 +/- 6 percent, respectively (p less than 0.05). The RVEF had no influence on the prevalence and complexity of early and late arrhythmias. Stratification of patients in group B into two subgroups based on the extent of RV dysfunction did not reveal any differences in the occurrence of all forms of ectopy (when both groups were matched to group A). Therefore, patients with inferior AMI, with or without RV infarction, have a similar prevalence of arrhythmias. Ventricular ectopic beats may be related to the severity and spread of LV involvement, rather than to RV dysfunction. 
1	Dose dependency of time of onset of radiation-induced growth hormone deficiency. Growth hormone (GH) secretion during insulin-induced hypoglycemia was assessed on 133 occasions in 82 survivors of childhood malignant disease. All had received cranial irradiation with a dose range to the hypothalamic-pituitary axis of 27 to 47.5 Gy (estimated by a schedule of 16 fractions over 3 weeks) and had been tested on one or more occasions between 0.2 and 18.9 years after treatment. Results of one third of the GH tests were defined as normal (GH peak response, greater than 15 mU/L) within the first 5 years, in comparison with 16% after 5 years. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed that dose (p = 0.007) and time from irradiation (p = 0.03), but not age at therapy, had a significant influence on peak GH responses. The late incidence of GH deficiency was similar over the whole dose range (4 of 26 GH test results normal for less than 30 Gy and 4 of 25 normal for greater than or equal to 30 Gy after 5 years), but the speed of onset over the first years was dependent on dose. We conclude that the requirement for GH replacement therapy and the timing of its introduction will be influenced by the dose of irradiation received by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. 
1	Rectal carcinoma: CT staging with water as contrast medium. Computed tomography (CT) was used to study 42 patients with rectal carcinoma. Water was used as a contrast medium for studying the local extent of tumor in all patients. Scans were read prospectively without knowledge of the histologic staging and then compared with pathologic specimens. CT depicted the tumor in all patients. Comparison of CT and histologic results (following the Dukes classification) showed that disease was correctly staged as A in three of four patients, as B in eight of 12, as C in 15 of 17, and as D in nine of nine. Overall, carcinoma was correctly staged with CT in 35 of 42 patients (diagnostic accuracy, 83.3%). The accuracy in the assessment of local invasion was 97.6% (41 of 42). In the detection of lymph node involvement, the accuracy was 78.6% (sensitivity, 88%; specificity, 64.7%). CT is recommended in the preoperative staging of rectal carcinoma and as an aid in choosing the appropriate therapy. The use of water enema and complete distention of the rectum are reliable techniques for improving the accuracy of CT in the assessment of local invasion by cancer. 
2	Diarrhea. Diarrhea is one manifestation of GI disturbance. Symptoms may be acute if caused by such things as infections, drug reactions, alterations in diet, heavy metal poisoning, or fecal impaction. Chronic diarrhea is a symptom of GI diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, lactase deficiency, cancer of the colon, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption diseases. Chronic diarrhea may also be associated with GI surgery, radiation therapy, laxative abuse, alcohol abuse, and chemotherapeutic agents. When interventions are required to deal with diarrhea, they may include such things as alteration in tube feeding products and methods of administration, fluid replacement by oral rehydration procedures, a rapid return to feeding, and education aimed at the health information clients need to prevent or control the symptom of diarrhea. 
5	Traumatic asphyxia. During a 5-year period, we treated 14 cases of traumatic asphyxia. There were 12 male and 2 female patients ranging in age from 2 to 32 years. Most suffered crushing injuries at work or were run over by motor vehicles. Mild to severe cervicofacial cyanosis and petechiae developed in all patients. A fear response was reported by 12 of the patients. Subconjunctival hemorrhage was also found in 12 patients. Nine patients had tachypnea and 7 complained of dyspnea. Most of the patients suffered some associated injuries including 8 head injuries, 7 pulmonary contusions, and 6 cases of blunt abdominal trauma. Less-associated injuries were rib fractures, brachial and radial nerve injuries, hemothorax, and pneumothorax. The hospital stay ranged from 4 to 28 days (mean, 14 days) and follow-up from 10 to 60 months (mean, 32 months). Treatment for traumatic asphyxia included measurement of arterial blood gases, oxygen supplementation, and intubation with mechanical ventilation. The patients' recovery conditions were relative to the severity of injury and the associated injuries. 
5	Extracapsular cataract surgery with lens implantation in diabetics with and without proliferative retinopathy In a retrospective study we have examined all diabetics (66 operated eyes) and an equal number of non-diabetic matched controls who underwent extracapsular cataract extracation (ECCE) with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation over a two-year period ending in December 1987. Of the diabetic patients' 76% eyes improved by at least two lines of Snellen acuity postoperatively. Of these patients 68% eyes and of the control eyes 83% achieved an acuity of 6/12 or better. In the diabetics the visual outcome depended on the state of the retinopathy and in particular the maculopathy. The diabetic group had a greater incidence of postoperative inflammation, but the major complications were related to continuing neovascularisation. Early postoperative laser photocoagulation may help to prevent these proliferative complications, and, provided a large, adequate capsulotomy is performed for capsular thickening, the presence of an IOL does not interfere with this photocoagulation. We also advise early postoperative assessment, and treatment if necessary, of any maculopathy. Diabetic retinopathy should no longer be regarded as a contraindication to intraocular lens insertion. 
5	National Institute of Mental Health longitudinal study of chronic schizophrenia. Prognosis and predictors of outcome [published erratum appears in Arch Gen Psychiatry 1991 Jul;48(7):642] We performed a longitudinal study of chronic schizophrenic patients who were hospitalized for research purposes at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Intramural Program in the 1970s and early 1980s. We assessed present course, outcome and predictor data from the initial cohort of 58 young chronic schizophrenic patients who were followed up for 2 to 12 years following their NIMH index hospitalization. At follow-up, the sample showed substantial functional impairment and levels of symptoms with only about 20% of the sample demonstrating a good outcome. In addition, strong intercorrelation was noted among the symptom and functioning indexes at follow-up. Moreover, neuropsychologic tests of frontal cortical functioning were significantly correlated with outcome levels of negative symptoms and social functioning but not with levels of positive symptoms. During the period from the index hospitalization to the follow-up assessment, 78% of the sample suffered a relapse, 38% attempted suicide and 24% had episodes of major affective illness. Furthermore, levels of positive and negative symptoms ascertained when patients received optimal neuroleptic treatment during the index hospitalization significantly predicted outcome levels of symptoms and functioning and time spent hospitalized during the follow-up period. In contrast, levels of index positive and negative symptoms ascertained during the drug-free state did not predict outcome symptoms or functioning. These data suggest that treatment response is a critical predictor variable. We examined the implication of these data for the course of illness in schizophrenics. 
2	The effect of diaper type and overclothing on fecal contamination in day-care centers [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Jun 5;265(21):2810] Fecal coliform contamination of environmental surfaces and hands in the day-care center is common. This study evaluated the effect of two diaper types on fecal contamination. Ten rooms in four day-care centers containing 141 children were studied in a prospective, randomized, crossover study. A total of 2946 samples were cultured during the 9-week study. Fecal coliforms were isolated from 307 inanimate objects (15%), 73 toy balls (46%), and 131 hands (17%). The number of contaminated inanimate objects was significantly less in rooms where paper diapers were worn when compared with that in rooms where double cloth diapers with plastic overpants were worn and in rooms where clothes were worn over diapers. Inanimate object cultures had more contamination in rooms in which diarrhea had occurred. Containment of feces by overclothes and diaper type may be important in decreasing transmission of enteric pathogens in day-care environments. 
4	Cytologic patterns in juice from human pancreatic transplants: correlation with histologic findings in the graft. In 19 patients who had undergone pancreatic transplantation with temporary exteriorization of the pancreatic juice, graft tissue became available for histologic examination. In these patients the cytologic patterns in the pancreatic juice were compared with the histologic findings in the graft specimens. In five samples the diagnosis by cytologic studies was rejection. Acute rejection was confirmed in all the histologic specimens. In eight cytologic samples, graft pancreatitis was suspected because of the increased amounts of neutrophils, degenerating cells, epithelial cells, monocytes, and some macrophages, with or without necrotic tissue fragments. All eight histologic specimens showed findings characteristic of pancreatitis. In three cytologic samples, bacteria or fungi were observed. Histologic examination of these patients showed graft pancreatitis. In four patients the cytologic findings were normal. Graft histologic factors were normal in two instances. In one of these grafts there was graft pancreatitis, and in one graft chronic vascular rejection was seen. Our study shows that two different pathologic events occurring in the pancreatic graft (i.e., acute rejection and pancreatitis) are reflected by characteristic changes in pancreatic juice cytology. 
3	Tests of EEG localization accuracy using implanted sources in the human brain. The accuracy with which electrical sources in the brain can be localized by using electroencephalograms measured on the scalp is not well known. In this study, tests of localization accuracy were performed by using implanted dipolar sources in the human brain. These dipoles are created by passing a weak (subthreshold) current through intracerebral electrodes implanted in the brains of epileptic patients for seizure monitoring. The locations of these dipoles are accurately known from roentgenographs. First, 16 electroencephalograms produced by these dipoles were recorded, then inverse solutions were calculated for the apparent sources of these electroencephalograms. Finally, the locations of the apparent sources were compared with the known locations of the implanted dipoles to determine localization error. The average localization error for a total of 28 dipoles in 3 subjects was 1.1 cm. These results indicate that good localization accuracy for focal sources in the brain can be provided by scalp electroencephalograms. 
1	Erythrocyte stearic acid desaturation in patients with colorectal carcinoma. The erythrocyte stearic:oleic acid ratio (saturation index) was investigated as a means of differentiating between control subjects (n = 146) and patients with benign (n = 48) and malignant (n = 117) colorectal disease and patients undergoing postoperative follow-up after curative resection (n = 49). Erythrocyte fatty acid profiles were determined by gas liquid chromatography. Neither age, sex, Dukes' stage, nor degree of differentiation of the tumors had a significant effect on the erythrocyte saturation index. The erythrocyte saturation index was lower in patients with primary and recurrent colorectal cancer compared with control subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease or benign colonic polyps (P less than 0.0001). The erythrocyte saturation index was not found to be useful in the postoperative follow-up of these patients. Using both saturation index and age as a means of differentiating between patients with primary colorectal cancer and control subjects gave a sensitivity of 67 percent and a specificity of 81 percent. 
5	Septic Streptococcus milleri spondylodiscitis. We describe 2 patients presenting lumbar spondylitis due to Streptococcus milleri. In both cases origin was related to preexistent intestinal pathology. Surgical drainage of a collection of pus was necessary in one case. Longterm antibiotic therapy led to full recovery. Despite confused nomenclature Streptococcus milleri must be considered a serious pathogen mainly associated with purulent infection with osteoarticular affinity. 
1	Dysgeusia, gustatory sweating, and crocodile tears syndrome induced by a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Facial nerve involvement in cerebellopontine angle tumors, both during their development and after excision, may be expressed in irreversible dysfunction of the parasympathetic pathways. The exact location of the lesion along the efferent nerve fibers can be established through evaluation of the functional level of those organs supplied by the cholinergic motor secretory components. This report deals with a female patient in whom peripheral facial palsy developed shortly after removal of a right cerebellopontine angle meningioma. She had slight facial asymmetry and deafness in the right ear and complained of prandial flush and sweating of the right malar area. Occult ipsilateral hyposalivation and hypolacrimation were diagnosed. In patients with seventh and ninth cranial nerve pathoses, evaluation of the end organs that are supplied by their associated autonomous nerve fibers is mandatory to prevent late ocular and oral sequelae. 
5	Effect of ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation on lung vascular permeability and resistance. The effect of ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation on pulmonary vascular permeability and resistance was studied in 25 isolated blood-perfused dog lungs. Vascular permeability, assessed by determining filtration coefficient (Kf), and vascular resistances were measured at the beginning and end of the experiment. Ischemia reperfusion was produced by occluding blood flow to the lung for 3 h and reperfusing for 1 h, whereas hypoxia reoxygenation was obtained by ventilating the lung with 95% N2-5% CO2 for 3 h and then ventilating with 95% O2-5% CO2 for 1 h with no interruption of perfusion. There was a significant increase in Kf in both ischemia reperfusion and hypoxia reoxygenation groups (51 and 85%, respectively), and total vascular resistance increased greatly in both groups (386 and 532%, respectively). Two additional groups were also studied in which the ischemia reperfusion or hypoxia reoxygenation lungs were pretreated with allopurinol (20 micrograms/ml). The Kf did not significantly increase in either the allopurinol ischemia reperfusion or the allopurinol hypoxia reoxygenation groups (22 and 6%, respectively). However, total vascular resistance significantly increased in both groups (239 and 224%, respectively). Although vascular permeability is modestly increased by both ischemia reperfusion and hypoxia reoxygenation, the predominant change in these conditions is the increased vascular resistance, which predominantly affects the postcapillary resistance and would result in a greater tendency for edema to develop in these slightly damaged lungs. Allopurinol, which inhibits xanthine oxidase, attenuated the permeability changes in both groups and may be useful in preventing ischemia reperfusion injury in certain conditions. 
2	Medical treatment and prevention of peptic ulcer disease. Many agents seem to be equally effective for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. This is true despite the drugs' varied mechanisms of action, and this observation has caused investigators to shift their focus from aggressive to defensive factors when studying ulcer pathogenesis. Patients with a healed ulcer are always at risk for recurrence, and guidelines are available for management of these patients. Ulcer prevention becomes a crucial issue in intensive care units where critically ill patients have many known risk factors. Maintaining a gastric pH above 4.0 appears to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with such stress-induced ulcers. Use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs increases ulcer risk and complications in the elderly, in women with rheumatoid arthritis, and in smokers and abusers of alcohol. Prophylaxis with the synthetic prostaglandin analogue misoprostol (Cytotec) appears to reduce this risk. 
5	Essential tremor: clinical correlates in 350 patients. To study the demographic and clinical correlates of essential tremor (ET), we analyzed a comprehensive database of 350 patients evaluated at the Movement Disorders Clinic at Baylor College of Medicine from 1982 to 1989. The age at onset of tremor showed bimodal distribution for both male and female patients, with peaks in 2nd and 6th decades. ET appeared most frequently in hands, followed by head, voice, tongue, leg, and trunk. Half of the patients (47%) had associated dystonia, including cervical dystonia, writer's cramp, spasmodic dysphonia, and cranial dystonia, and 20% of the patients had associated parkinsonism. At least one 1st-degree relative of 62.5% of ET patients reported tremor. Alcohol relieved tremor in 2/3 of ET patients. Sixty-eight percent of patients who had adequate follow-up improved with propranolol, and 72% with primidone. There was no significant difference in various clinical variables between the 219 patients with familial ET and 131 with sporadic ET. Patients with early-onset ET were more likely to have hand involvement and associated dystonia than patients with late-onset ET. Dystonia was more frequently associated with mild ET than with severe ET. Patients with low-frequency tremor were older and had more head but less hand involvement than patients with high-frequency tremor. The lack of relevant differences between ET subgroups suggests that, despite variable expression, ET represents a single disease entity. 
3	Transoesophageal pacing for perioperative control of neonatal paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The perioperative management of a 16-day-old infant with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is discussed. Vagal manoeuvres and medication were not adequate in controlling the SVT. Since the patient was scheduled for extensive surgery in the prone position, it was decided to use transoesophageal pacing as the method of choice for conversion of SVT. Transoesophageal pacing succeeded several times in overriding the SVT and restoring normal heart rate and haemodynamic variables. The advantages and disadvantages of various methods of treating SVT in the newborn are discussed. 
3	Noninvasive cerebral optical spectroscopy for monitoring cerebral oxygen delivery and hemodynamics. OBJECTIVE: To present an algorithm for noninvasive measurement of cerebral oxygen saturation (cerebral oximetry) and cerebral hemodynamics with near infrared spectroscopy. DESIGN: In vitro correlation of oximetry measurements with reference measurements; illustrative cases of hemodynamic and oximetric recordings. SETTING: Tertiary care neuroscience ICU. PATIENTS: Brain-injured patients with a prolonged, decreased level of consciousness chosen as illustrative examples. INTERVENTIONS: Two-channel multiple wavelength diffuse infrared transmission spectroscopy was interfaced with the scalp using adhesive. Transmission data were collected with gross superficial-to-deep spatial resolution. Saturation calculation based on the deep signal was observed longitudinally in the patient. With the same technology, arterial input and cerebral response functions, generated by iv tracer bolus, were deconvoluted to measure mean cerebral transit time. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A positive linear regression fit between diffuse transmission oximetry and measured blood oxygen saturation over the range 23% to 99% (r2 = .98, p less than .001) was noted. CONCLUSIONS: The approach used overcomes previously identified difficulties with cerebral oximetry, and demonstrates excellent in vitro correlation. The technique can be performed clinically without difficulty. A simultaneous measure of mean cortical transit time is possible. 
3	Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology. Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department. For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize. On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis. The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic. A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain. 
3	Developmental dyslexia in women: neuropathological findings in three patients. Brains from male cases with dyslexia show symmetry of the planum temporale and predominantly left-sided cerebrocortical microdysgenesis. We now report on three women with dyslexia. In all brains, the planum temporale was again symmetrical. Also, in two of the brains, multiple foci of cerebrocortical glial scarring were present. In both women, many of the scars were myelinated, suggesting origination during late intrauterine or early postnatal life. In one, scars were mainly left perisylvian and involved portions of the vascular border zone of the temporal cortex. In the other, scars were more numerous and occurred in the border zone of the anterior, middle, and posterior cerebral arteries symmetrically. All three cases showed to a variable extent brain warts, molecular layer ectopias, and focal architectonic dysplasia identical to those seen in the male cases. Two women had primary brain neoplasms, an oligodendroglioma and a low-grade astrocytoma, respectively, and two women showed small angiomas. Reexamination of previously reported male cases disclosed one with myelinated glial scars. Two control brains with asymmetrical plana temporale showed myelinated glial scars as well. The significance of the anatomical findings is discussed, and possible etiological factors are considered with known effects of autoimmune diseases on the nervous system. 
4	Cardiac catheterisation with 5 French catheters. From the beginning of November 1987 to the end of January 1989, 526 coronary arteriograms and left ventricular angiograms were performed with 5 French coronary catheters. In 448 (85%) patients diagnostic pictures were obtained with three standard types of 5 French catheters (No 4 Judkins): that is, left coronary, right coronary, and pigtail catheters. In 60 patients (11.4%) various other 5 French catheters were required to complete the study. In nine patients (1.7%), a 7 or 8 French catheter was used. Major complications causing cardiac arrest or requiring urgent operation developed in five patients. Sixty two patients (11.77%) had minor complications that required sublingual nitrates or a single bolus of atropine, or developed a haematoma that did not need intervention or had a mild reaction to the contrast material. Complications of moderate severity developed in 17 patients (3.2%): severe chest pain, arrhythmia requiring a temporary pacemaker, contrast reaction associated with hypotension, haematoma requiring blood transfusion, or a transient ischaemic episode. There were no deaths. 5 French catheters were used for routine coronary angiography and left ventriculography in 98.3% of patients. There were no major complications related to femoral artery puncture. The routine use of 5 French coronary catheters should increase the feasibility of safe coronary angiography in outpatients and should reduce the cost of this investigation. 
5	Benzodiazepine tranquilizers and the risk of accidental injury. To determine whether benzodiazepine tranquilizers increase the risk of accidental injury requiring medical attention, we used pharmacy claims submitted to a large third-party payer to identify 4,554 persons who had been prescribed these agents and a matched control group of 13,662 persons who had been prescribed drugs other than benzodiazepines. We then used diagnoses recorded on claims submitted by medical care providers to identify all accident-related care received by these persons during three months before their first-observed prescription for a benzodiazepine or nonbenzodiazepine agent, respectively, and six months subsequently. We found accident-related care was more likely among persons who had been prescribed benzodiazepines; among these persons, the probability of an accident-related medical encounter was higher during months in which a prescription for a benzodiazepine had recently been filled compared to other months; and persons who had filled three or more prescriptions for these agents in the six months following initiation of therapy had a significantly higher risk of an accident-related medical event than those who had filled only one such prescription. Approximately two-fold risks of accident-related care were found, after controlling for age, sex, and prior utilization. 
4	Clinical experience with the Medtronic-Hall valve prosthesis. Medtronic-Hall valves were implanted during 204 procedures performed between 1982 and 1988. Mean population age was 54.4 years; 96% of patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or greater. Emergency operations constituted 16% of the procedures. Rheumatic heart disease was the single most common indication for valve replacement. In 18% of patients, operation was performed to replace a previous prosthetic valve. The mean follow-up was 3.2 years. Overall operative mortality was 10.3%, the highest mortality being for double-valve replacements (24%). Valve-related mortality, by position, was 5.3% for aortic valves, 6.0% for mitral valves, and 4.0% for multiple-valve replacements. Actuarial 5-year freedom from events were: survival, 68%; thromboembolism, 90%; prosthetic valve endocarditis, 98%; paravalvular leak, 95%; and reoperation, 92%. Complications with the highest mortality were thromboembolism (36%) and endocarditis (33%). The complication rates in this series are high but the patients were more severely ill than in other reports, and operative survivors experienced a considerable improvement in New York Heart Association functional class. 
2	Ischemic colitis. An ever-changing spectrum? Ischemic colitis, or more properly colonic ischemia, became a clear clinical entity in the past 25 years. Yet, early diagnosis of this disease with its various presentations remains a difficult task. A 10-year review at our hospital identified 38 patients with colonic ischemia for comparison with the authors' previous experience and with data from the literature. Several important factors emerge: (1) Twice as many cases occurred after operations (34% in this series vs. 16% in the past), probably because fewer and fewer spontaneous cases were hospitalized. (2) Sixteen patients required operative intervention for colonic ischemia with a mortality of 62 per cent, while those treated nonoperatively had a mortality of 14 per cent. Seven of eight postoperative patients who required a second operative procedure for their colonic ischemia died. A high clinical suspicion is necessary in the postoperative patient, as colonic ischemia appears to be more severe among these patients. Moreover, the high incidence of associated cardiovascular disease indicates that early diagnosis, as well as monitoring of the "at-risk" patient, is needed for improvement in survival to occur. New monitoring methods, such as tonometry, may help accomplish this goal. 
5	Noninvasive detection of patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease prone to ventricular fibrillation. Abnormalities in the fast Fourier transforms of signal-averaged electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained during sinus rhythm appear to distinguish patients with ischemic heart disease and sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from those without ventricular tachycardia. This study was performed to determine the power of frequency analysis to detect patients with a history of ventricular fibrillation, to determine the extent to which spectra of signal-averaged ECGs from patients with ischemic and nonischemic heart disease are comparable and to compare results of signal-averaged ECG analysis in patients with ventricular fibrillation with results of programmed ventricular stimulation. Signal-averaged ECGs were obtained during sinus rhythm from 60 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia (Group I) and 34 patients with ventricular fibrillation (Group II). Results of signal-averaged ECG analysis were abnormal in 92% of patients with ventricular tachycardia and 85% of patients with ventricular fibrillation (p = NS). Abnormal spectra were detected in the signal-averaged ECGs from 90% of patients with ischemic and from 86% of patients with nonischemic heart disease (p = NS). In contrast, the results of programmed stimulation differed markedly between the two patient groups. Sustained ventricular arrhythmias were induced in 91% of the patients with ventricular tachycardia compared with only 46% of those with ventricular fibrillation (p less than 0.0001). Moreover, ventricular tachycardia was inducible in 81% of patients with ischemic heart disease compared with only 50% of those with nonischemic heart disease (p less than 0.02). Thus, abnormalities in the spectra of signal-averaged ECGs were found in the majority of patients with ventricular fibrillation and were detectable even in those whose arrhythmia was not inducible by programmed stimulation. These results broaden the potential clinical application of noninvasive interrogation of signal-averaged ECGs to include the prospective identification of patients with ischemic or nonischemic heart disease prone to ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. 
2	Omeprazole in H2 receptor antagonist-resistant reflux esophagitis. We conducted a retrospective review of 25 patients with severe reflux esophagitis treated with omeprazole because of failure of H2 receptor antagonists to heal their esophagitis. Prior to beginning omeprazole (40 mg/day), all patients were on H2 antagonists for at least 9 months and still had endoscopic evidence of longitudinal (grade II) or circumferential (grade III) distal esophageal ulceration. Omeprazole therapy brought about complete endoscopic healing in 24 of 25 patients (96%). Twenty-three of 24 healed patients were then restarted on H2 antagonists as maintenance therapy. Repeat endoscopy was performed if symptoms recurred. Fourteen of 24 patients (58%) had recurrence of endoscopic esophagitis documented between 26 and 300 days from the time of starting maintenance therapy. Two of these 14 patients opted for antireflux surgery, whereas the remaining 12 were once again given omeprazole, which again resulted in symptom resolution in all patients. These data suggest that most patients with H2 receptor antagonist-resistant ulcerative esophagitis cannot be successfully maintained on H2 antagonists even after the ulcers have been healed with omeprazole. Further studies are required to determine the role of omeprazole compared to other treatments in the long-term maintenance therapy of these patients. 
5	The molecular genetic basis of Glanzmann thrombasthenia in the Iraqi-Jewish and Arab populations in Israel. Glanzmann thrombasthenia is an autosomal recessive bleeding disorder characterized by a decrease or absence of functional platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa (alpha IIb beta 3) integrin receptors. Although thrombasthenia is a rare disorder, its occurrence is increased in some regions of the world where intracommunity marriage and consanguinity are commonplace, resulting in increased expression of autosomal recessive traits. We have been studying two populations having an unusually high frequency of Glanzmann disease, Iraqi Jews and Arabs living in Israel, and were able to distinguish the populations on the basis of immunodetectable GPIIIa and platelet surface vitronectin receptor (alpha v beta 3) expression. In this article, we describe molecular genetic studies based on use of the PCR that have allowed us to characterize platelet mRNA sequences encoding GPIIb and GPIIIa from patients in these populations. In six of six Iraqi-Jewish families studied, cDNA sequence analysis identified an 11-base deletion within exon 12 of the GPIIIa gene. This mutation produces a frameshift leading to protein termination shortly before the transmembrane domain of GPIIIa. In contrast, a 13-base deletion encompassing the splice acceptor site of exon 4 of the GPIIb gene was found in three of five Arab kindreds studied. This deletion results in forced alternative splicing to a downstream AG acceptor, producing a 6-amino acid deletion in the GPIIb protein, including a single cysteine residue. These nucleotide sequence variations were exploited to design a rapid, PCR-based oligonucleotide dot-blot hybridization test for both pre- and postnatal diagnosis of Glanzmann disease. These studies demonstrate the heterogeneity of Glanzmann thrombasthenia in different populations, and its homogeneity within geographically restricted populations, and offer insight into the requirements for integrin surface expression. 
1	Cryosurgery and acrylic cementation as surgical adjuncts in the treatment of aggressive (benign) bone tumors. Analysis of 25 patients below the age of 21. This article reviews the clinical experience with cryosurgery (use of liquid nitrogen) and acrylic cementation (polymethylmethacrylate; PMMA) in the treatment of aggressive, benign bone sarcomas and the biologic basis of this technique. The results of 25 patients below the age of 21 treated by cryosurgery, with an average follow-up period of 60.8 months, are reported. Three approaches to surgical reconstruction were used: Group 1 (four patients) had cryosurgery with no reconstruction, Group 2 (13 patients) had bone graft reconstruction alone, and Group 3 (eight patients) had composite osteosynthesis with internal fixation, bone graft, and/or PMMA. The overall control rate was 96% (one recurrence). The tumor types were giant-cell tumor, chondroblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst, and malignant giant-cell tumor. Nineteen lesions involved the lower extremity, and six lesions were located in the upper extremity. There were two secondary fractures (8%), one local flap necrosis, and one synovial fistula. There were no infections. Two epiphyseodeses were performed. The functional results were excellent (83%), good (13%), and fair (4%). The technique of composite osteosynthesis is recommended for all large tumors of the lower extremity. Cryosurgical results compare favorably with those obtained by en bloc resection and demonstrate the ability of cryosurgery to eradicate tumors while avoiding the need for extensive resections and reconstructive procedures. 
5	Role of experience in the response to simulated critical incidents. Eight experienced anesthesiologists (faculty or private practitioners) were presented with the same simulated critical incidents that had previously been presented to 19 anesthesia trainees. The detection and correction times for these incidents were measured, as was compliance with Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines during cardiac arrest, and the occurrence of unplanned incidents. Experienced personnel tended to react more rapidly than did trainees, but differences between second-year anesthesia residents (CA2) and experienced anesthesiologists were not statistically significant. There was a high variability in performance between incidents and within each group. Unplanned errors and management flaws still occurred with experience subjects. The response to incidents during anesthesia is a complex process that involves multiple levels of cognitive activity and is vulnerable to error regardless of experience. Most trainees seemed to acquire adequate response routines by the end of the CA2 year. Formal reasoning appeared to play a minor role in responding to intraoperative events, but the exact nature of the anesthesiologist's cognition remains to be thoroughly investigated. 
1	The fallacy of the screening interval for cervical smears. One hundred seventy-four women with invasive cervical carcinoma were interviewed about their cervical smear histories to assess the accuracy of self-reporting and to relate the smear history with patient and tumor characteristics. Patients reported significantly more frequent, more recent, and more normal smears than were documented in medical records. The interval between onset of cancer symptoms and previous smear correlated directly with advanced stage. Sixteen women with normal smears within 36 months had significantly more advanced cancers than did 25 women with recent abnormal smears. Women with recent normal and abnormal smears had similar sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics. Because of inaccuracies in patients' self-reported smear histories and cancers developing in women with recent normal smears, we conclude that a specific screening interval should not be relied upon. 
1	Primary central nervous system lymphoma in patients with and without the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A retrospective analysis and review of the literature. Twenty-two cases of PCL were reviewed, in which 9 patients had AIDS and 13 did not. A review of the literature identified 247 cases of AIDS-related PCL. Differences between patients with AIDS and immunocompetent PCL were noted in our series. AIDS-related PCL when compared to non-AIDS PCL in our series has the following notable clinical features: 1) significantly younger age at presentation, median age 34 versus 59 years; 2) significantly higher incidence of B symptoms, 44% versus 8%; 3) worse median performance status at presentation, 3 versus 1; and, 4) shorter median survival, 3 versus 10 months. Differences in performance status and survival, however, were not significant. AIDS-related PCL is further characterized by frequent (44%) ring-enhancing mass lesions on head CT scan, a finding that makes it clinically difficult to distinguish from toxoplasmosis. Median survival appears to be improved in the absence of opportunistic infection at time of diagnosis of PCL, 6 versus 2 months. The therapeutic approach to patients with PCL, with and without AIDS, is variable. Combined modality therapy may improve the survival in patients with non-AIDS PCL. Therapy for patients with AIDS-related PCL is tailored to the status of the individual and it is, therefore, difficult to make comparisons to non-AIDS PCL patients. AIDS patients are often too ill to tolerate aggressive surgery or systemic treatment and in this instance, radiotherapy alone may be an acceptable alternative. Nonetheless, overall survival for patients with AIDS-related and non-AIDS PCL remains poor. 
4	Steal-prone coronary anatomy and myocardial ischemia associated with four primary anesthetic agents in humans. To examine the relationship between myocardial ischemia in patients with steal-prone coronary anatomy and the administration of isoflurane anesthesia, we reviewed coronary angiograms of 955 patients who had participated in a randomized trial of the use of one of four primary anesthetics for coronary artery bypass operations. Steal-prone anatomy was found in 31.8% of patients who had received enflurane; 40.0%, halothane; 32.6%, isoflurane; and 31.7%, sufentanil. Detected by greater than or equal to 0.1 mV ST segment displacement, ischemia during anesthesia occurred in 290 (30.4%) of all patients with no difference in the incidence among the four primary anesthetics (27.5%-32.9%). Patients with steal-prone anatomy did not suffer more ischemia than patients who needed coronary artery bypass surgery but with other varieties of coronary anatomy. In patients with steal-prone coronary anatomy, the incidence of myocardial ischemia by primary anesthetic was 24.0% with enflurane, 34.4% with halothane, 32.1% with isoflurane, and 38.2% with sufentanil. Systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg during anesthesia occurred in 416 (45.6%) patients and was twice as common during administration of volatile anesthetics than during that of sufentanil. Hypotension did not increase ischemia frequency in patients with steal-prone anatomy with use of any of the four primary anesthetics including isoflurane. Ischemia was temporally related to hypotension in only 9 patients (0.9%). In none of the 42 patients who had steal-prone anatomy and hypotension during isoflurane anesthesia was ischemia temporally related to hypotension. 
5	Primary mass closure of midline incisions with a continuous polyglyconate monofilament absorbable suture. Mass closure of midline incisions with a running large-bore permanent monofilament polypropylene suture has been used in general surgery and gynecology patients with a reported small incidence of fascial dehiscence. Late-occurring wound sinus formation is one problem reported with the use of this permanent suture material. Over a 22-month period, 285 patients had midline incisions closed with a continuous, running no. 1 polyglyconate monofilament delayed absorbable suture. Closely spaced bites (about 1.5 cm apart) were taken and placed 2 cm lateral to the fascial edge. Over 60% of the patients had surgery because of gynecologic cancer. Other high-risk factors included obesity in 62%, diabetes in 19%, and previous irradiation or chemotherapy in 22%. An ovarian cancer staging procedure was done in 16% of the patients. Of the remaining patients, almost half had extensive operative procedures that ranged from exenterations to hysterectomies with lymph node dissection. Wound complications were noted in nine patients (3.2%). Seven had superficial infections, one had an evisceration, and one developed a ventral hernia. Wound sinuses did not occur. The closure technique is safe and expedient and distributes tension equally over a continuous line. It has the additional advantage of eventual absorption of the suture material, thereby avoiding the wound sinus problems occasionally reported with large-bore permanent sutures. 
4	Portal vein resection with a new antithrombogenic catheter. Curative resection of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors is rarely possible because of local invasion, especially into the portal vein. We developed a new antithrombogenic catheter using a heparinized hydrophilic polymer to allow portal vein bypass during resection of tumors invading the portal vein. Pancreatectomy or hepatectomy accompanied by portal vein resection was performed for pancreatic or hepatobiliary cancer, with an intraoperative shunt from the superior mesenteric vein to the femoral vein or from the superior mesenteric vein to the intrahepatic portal vein through the umbilical vein or the hepatic hilar portal vein. Use of the shunt prevented stasis in the superior mesenteric vein and hepatic ischemia even during prolonged occlusion of the portal vein, and portal vein resection was performed in 81 patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease with greater safety and ease. 
3	Stridor: intracranial pathology causing postextubation vocal cord paralysis. During an 18-month period in a pediatric intensive care unit, nine patients with vocal cord paralysis were identified using flexible bronchoscopy. When tracheally extubated, each child was found to have stridor. The children ranged in age from 17 days to 5 1/2 years. Two patients had unilateral paralysis, but neither required tracheostomy. Seven patients displayed bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis. Of these, six patients required tracheostomy. Surgical injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve was the probable cause in two patients. The other seven patients had neurologic disorders with documented or suspected increases of intracranial pressure. Four of the seven patients with bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis regained cord mobility within 4 months. Both children with unilateral cord paralysis have no stridor and vocalize well 1 year later. Cord paralysis in the setting of intracranial hypertension probably results from compression or ischemia of the vagus nerve before it exits the skull. Early visualization of the larynx should be done in patients who become stridulous when extubated, especially those with prior thoracic procedures or with neurologic disorders associated with intracranial hypertension. 
2	Healing or amelioration of esophagitis does not result in increased lower esophageal sphincter or esophageal contractile pressure [published erratum appears in Am J Gastroenterol 1991 Feb;86(2):253] There is conflicting evidence regarding whether lower esophageal sphincter and esophageal contractile pressures are affected by changes in the severity of gastroesophageal reflux disease. We compared the manometric and endoscopic findings from 30 patients before and after treatment for esophagitis. Before treatment, the grade of esophagitis (I-III) was significantly correlated (r = -0.37; p less than 0.05) with lower esophageal sphincter pressure, but not with esophageal contractile pressure. After treatment, the grade of esophagitis did not change or became worse in 15 patients, and became better in 15 patients. Of these, seven healed. The group that showed no endoscopic improvement demonstrated no change in lower esophageal sphincter or esophageal contractile pressures. The group that did show endoscopic improvement also demonstrated no increase in lower esophageal sphincter or esophageal contractile pressures, and this was particularly evident in those whose esophagitis healed. These data suggest that healing of esophagitis does not result in improvement of esophageal motor function. 
2	The intracolonic bypass tube for left colon and rectal trauma. The avoidance of a colostomy. Traumatic perforations of the left colon and rectum are most frequently managed by procedures that include the formation of a colostomy. Primary repair without colostomy is much less commonly employed. We report nine patients with traumatic perforations of the left colon and rectum treated with the intracolonic bypass tube (ICBT) without concomitant colostomy. In all these patients we believe the standard treatment would have included fecal diversion. Four patients sustained blunt trauma and five sustained penetrating trauma. Healing of the colonic anastomosis occurred in all cases, and the ICBTs were passed per rectum between the tenth and nineteenth days postoperatively. On the basis of this study, we conclude that the ICBT has a role in the treatment of selected injuries of the left colon and rectum as a safe means of avoiding a colostomy. 
4	Dynamic positron tomographic imaging with nitrogen-13 glutamate in patients with coronary artery disease: comparison with nitrogen-13 ammonia and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose imaging. This study was designed to test the usefulness of nitrogen-13 (N-13) glutamate imaging with positron emission tomography in defining myocardial ischemia in humans. Seventeen patients who had undergone coronary arteriography were studied with N-13 glutamate at peak supine exercise using a bicycle ergometer, as well as with the flow tracer N-13 ammonia at peak exercise during a second similar exercise test. Six of the patients also underwent imaging with N-13 glutamate at rest before exercise testing; in the remaining 11 patients imaging with fluorine-18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose was performed to assess glucose metabolism after the second exercise test. Seven patients had classic metabolism-flow mismatches consistent with ischemia (that is, decreased N-13 ammonia uptake in a region with relatively increased F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose uptake). There was no evidence of increased N-13 glutamate uptake in the ischemic mismatched regions in any of these patients. In all 17 patients, the uptake of N-13 glutamate during exercise paralleled the uptake of N-13 ammonia during exercise, suggesting that N-13 glutamate behaves as a flow tracer rather than as a metabolic marker of ischemia in humans. 
5	Evaluation of the results of oesophagectomy for oesophageal cancer. The long-term results of standard techniques of oesophagectomy were examined in 127 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus. A near-total oesophagectomy with a cervical anastomosis was performed in 93 patients and an oesophagogastrectomy with an intrathoracic anastomosis was carried out in 34 patients. One hundred and eight patients had a curative oesophagectomy and 19 patients had a palliative resection. Eight patients received radiotherapy to the tumour bed. There were 15 deaths in hospital and the overall 5-year survival rate including perioperative deaths was 13.2 per cent. Survival was adversely affected by incomplete excision of macroscopic tumour (P less than 0.001), positive regional lymph nodes (P less than 0.05) and distant lymphatic metastases (P less than 0.02). The 5-year survival rate of patients with tumour invasion beyond the oesophageal wall (T3) and negative nodes was 20 per cent. Postoperative irradiation had no effect on the survival of patients with gross residual tumour. Complete clearance of microscopic tumour was achieved in 50 per cent of patients with T3 tumours and this group did not benefit from adjuvant radiotherapy. Survival in patients undergoing curative oesophagectomy with residual microscopic tumour, however, was significantly improved by irradiation of the tumour bed (P less than 0.01). These results suggest that the survival of patients can be increased significantly by the excision of all gross tumour and by identification of those who will benefit from local radiotherapy. 
5	Effect of hypoxia on cerebral metabolites measured by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in rats. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a unique method to monitor noninvasively the concentrations of cerebral metabolites. N-Acetyl-L-aspartate, the concentration of which is assumed to be stable during hypoxia, has been used to form ratios with lactate. To determine the stability of the signal from N-acetyl-L-aspartate, we used a model of graded hypoxia in rats to monitor the percentage changes from baseline of the peak heights for lactate, lipids, and N-acetyl-L-aspartate. Anesthetized adult rats were exposed sequentially to 15% and 10% O2 while proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were collected with a surface coil in a 7-T 89-mm-bore spectrometer. Brain lactate concentration was either increased by feeding or infusion of glucose (n = 9) or lowered by fasting (n = 7). After death the brains were removed and frozen, and the water- and lipid-soluble compounds were extracted to identify the origin of the signals. We analyzed the data both as the percentage change from baseline for heights of the lactate (1.33 ppm), lipids (1.5 ppm), and N-acetyl-L-aspartate (2.02 ppm) peaks and as the ratios of heights of the 1.33 and 2.02 and the 1.5 and 2.02 ppm peaks. Both hypoxic episodes caused a 45% decrease from baseline in the 2.02 ppm peak. During the second hypoxic episode, the 1.33:2.02 ppm peak height ratio increased significantly in hyperglycemic rats (p less than 0.05) but was unchanged in hypoglycemic rats. 
5	Mast cell/nerve interactions in vitro and in vivo. In this report, we review the evidence for mast cell/nerve interactions. We believe that the morphologic and functional evidence now strongly support a purposeful and biologically significant interaction between these two cell types. This interaction has physiologic consequences and appears to be able to regulate such local events as chloride ion secretion by epithelial cells of the intestinal and respiratory tracts in experimental models. In this way, the mast cell and nerve may be considered as a functional homeostatic regulatory unit. The extent to which this unit may be involved in maintenance of normal integrity of mucous membranes or other structures, in health and in disease, is not clear at the present and will require considerably more investigation and elucidation. However, the concept of such an interaction is an interesting one and may bring new approaches of a therapeutic and diagnostic nature to bear on some old problems. The observations reviewed in this report that psychologic conditioning may itself cause mucosal mast cell degranulation and mediator release in the rat is significant. We consider that this evidence of central nervous system control of mast cell degranulation is an extension of the idea that mast cells and nerves communicate. 
5	National allocation of cadaveric kidneys by HLA matching. Projected effect on outcome and costs. BACKGROUND. Although receiving a cadaveric kidney matched at the HLA-A, B, and DR loci enhances graft survival in cyclosporine-treated patients, the value of a national system of kidney allocation based on HLA matching, with the attendant increased likelihood of better matching, is still questioned. Some fear that the costs of a national system are unjustified when only a small fraction of donors would exactly match any of the 16,000 potential recipients anyway. We estimated the effect on graft survival of the use of HLA matching for all allocations of cadaveric kidneys in the United States. METHODS. The graft-survival rates in five mutually exclusive groups of transplants with increasing numbers of HLA mismatches were estimated by partitioning the data for 22,190 first-time recipients of cadaveric kidneys. Overall graft survival was projected as a weighted average with use of the percentages of transplants in the hierarchical groups in recipient waiting pools of various sizes. We compared the benefits and costs of HLA matching in a national system with those of introducing cyclosporine, which was projected to enhance graft survival by 7 percentage points at 10 years. RESULTS. Sharing kidneys nationally on the basis of hierarchical HLA matching was estimated to enhance graft survival by an additional 5 percentage points at 10 years. The anticipated five-year cost of national allocation of kidneys by HLA matching for 7000 recipients, including consideration of the costs of graft removal and dialysis after transplant rejection, would be +4F6.5 million less than the cost of using cyclosporine alone. CONCLUSIONS. The use of an HLA allocation system will not add to the cost of renal transplantation, but it will improve the long-term results to the same extent as cyclosporine. We propose the initiation of a national kidney-sharing system based on hierarchical levels of HLA matches. 
1	Management of selected cystic adnexal masses in postmenopausal women by operative laparoscopy: a pilot study. Twenty-five postmenopausal patients were predicted to have benign masses by screening criteria that included ultrasonographic findings of a cystic adnexal mass less than 10 cm with distinct borders and no evidence of irregular solid parts, thick septa, ascites, or matted bowel, and a normal serum CA 125 value (less than 35 U/ml). All 25 masses were accurately predicted to be benign. The size of the cysts on ultrasonography ranged from 3 to 9 cm with a mean of 5 cm. Twenty-two patients (88%) were successfully managed by operative laparoscopy and adnexectomy. Mean operative time was 70 minutes and mean postoperative hospital stay was 12 hours. Mean time of return to normal activity was 5 days. Three patients required laparotomy. We conclude that removal of these cystic adnexal masses by operative laparoscopy is an acceptable alternative in carefully selected postmenopausal women. 
1	Solid and cystic ultimobranchial body remnants in the thyroid. In this study we determined the incidence rate (89%) and characterized the morphology of ultimobranchial body (UBB) remnants found in 18 serially sectioned neonatal thyroid glands. Although UBB remnants are often referred to as solid cell nests, we found cystic features in 55%. Ciliated columnar cells were seen in 23%. One contained a large pseudo-papilla. The UBB cells had nuclei with features reminiscent of papillary carcinoma nuclei in that they were enlarged, oval, and contained finely dispersed chromatin when compared with follicular cell nuclei. Both papillary carcinomas and UBB remnants are common, occur as tiny, solid, or cystic thyroid entities in patients of all ages, may contain papillary structures, and share some common nuclear features. Therefore, it is important to include UBB remnants in the differential diagnosis of minute thyroid entities and to recognize their morphologic features. 
2	Prospective study on prevalence of esophageal chest pain in patients referred on an elective basis to a cardiac unit for suspected myocardial ischemia. The prevalence of esophageal chest pain was studied prospectively in patients referred on an elective basis to a cardiac unit for suspected myocardial ischemia. A group of 248 consecutive patients without previously documented heart disease was admitted for elective diagnostic coronary angiography. The clinical history classified 185 patients as having anginal pain and the coronary angiogram was normal in 48 of them. In 37 of these 48 patients full esophageal testing was performed including 24-hr intraesophageal pH and pressure recordings with indication of chest pain episodes as well as a number of esophageal provocation tests, ie, acid perfusion, edrophonium stimulation, balloon distension, and ergonovine stimulation, all performed under continuous esophageal manometric and electrocardiographic monitoring. In 19 of these 37 patients, the familiar chest pain could be reproduced by esophageal provocative testing without ischemic ST-T segment alterations; six of these 19 patients had also a positive 24-hr pH and pressure recording. These data strongly suggest an esophageal origin of chest pain in half the patients with typical angina and a normal coronary angiogram. 
5	Hypoxanthine levels in vitreous humor: evidence of hypoxia in most infants who died of sudden infant death syndrome. Postmortem changes of the hypoxanthine in vitreous humor in humans were investigated. Hypoxanthine is formed from hypoxic degradation of adenosine monophosphate. Repeated sampling was performed in 13 deceased adults. Keeping the bodies at +6 degrees C, the increase of the hypoxanthine levels was estimated to 3.5 mumol/L per hour when sampling was started more than 12 hours after death (range 2.8 to 5.6 mumol/L per hour). Results of hypoxanthine measurements from vitreous humor in 73 infants with sudden infant death syndrome, 17 infants and children who died sudden violent deaths, and 6 neonates who died suddenly without hypoxemia prior to death were corrected according to the expected postmortem hypoxanthine increase. The time between death and autopsy was similar in the three groups studied. The corrected median hypoxanthine level in the group with sudden infant death syndrome was 227 mumol/L, which is significantly higher than in the other groups; 22 mumol/L in the group who had violent deaths (P less than .01), and 0 mumol/L in the neonate group (P less than .01). The findings seem to confirm that sudden infant death is preceded by a relatively long period of tissue hypoxia in most cases. 
1	Leukemias of indeterminant lineage. Two biologically and clinically important forms of acute leukemia have been described. Evidence suggests that both undifferentiated acute leukemia and many types of hybrid leukemia arise from relatively fewer differentiated cells than do the more straightforward acute leukemias. Clinical correlations suggest that patients with these leukemias may have a poorer prognosis, although some findings may be associated with an improved prognosis. More data in which multiple techniques are applied to the same leukemic cells are clearly needed. Patients with certain types of hybrid leukemias may be suitable candidates for more aggressive forms of chemotherapy or, possibly, combinations of therapy directed at cells of both lineages. 
5	Vaccination against hepatitis B and protection against chronic viral carriage in The Gambia. 358 children in the Gambian villages of Keneba and Manduar, where hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic, were vaccinated with plasma-derived vaccine against HBV according to one of four regimens and followed for up to 4 years. Two regimens by which vaccine was injected intradermally into children between 0 and 4 years old led to peak geometric mean (95% CI) concentrations of antibody against HBV surface antigen of 270 (202-358) and 555 (418-748) mlU/ml. The third regimen--intramuscular vaccination of children aged between 0 and 4 years--gave geometric mean peak antibody concentrations of 926 (765-1122) mlU/ml. A fourth regimen was intramuscular vaccination of children between 1 and 9 months old, which gave geometric mean antibody concentrations of 5431 (3903-75,456) mlU/ml. Despite these widely divergent responses and a 89% decay in antibody over the first 2 years, vaccination against HBV was 97% effective in preventing chronic infection. Vaccination was less effective in preventing uncomplicated infection: 5.3% of 264 vaccinees in Keneba and 19.1% of 94 vaccinees in Manduar tested positive for antibody to HBV core antigen. These "breakthrough infections" did not differ in frequency between regimens, and were associated with low initial antibody responses and chronic maternal carriage of HBV. 
5	Total knee arthroplasty in diabetes mellitus. A retrospective study was done of 59 total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) in 40 patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The overall infection rate was 7%, with an overall revision rate of 10% and an average follow-up period of 4.3 years. Wound complications were present in 12% of the TKAs. The rate of deep joint infections in diabetic patients was statistically higher than the reported incidence of sepsis in nondiabetic patients. Therefore, maximum precautions should be taken for diabetic patients having TKA to minimize both wound complications and joint sepsis. 
4	Expected gains in life expectancy from various coronary heart disease risk factor modifications BACKGROUND. Despite much evidence that modifying risk factors for coronary heart disease can decrease morbidity and mortality, little is known about the impact of risk-factor modification on life expectancy. METHODS AND RESULTS. We used the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model, a state-transition computer simulation of the US population, to forecast potential gains in life expectancy from risk-factor modification for the cohort of Americans turning age 35 in 1990. Among 35-year-old men, we projected that the population-wide increase in life expectancy would be about 1.1 years from strict blood pressure control, 0.8 years from smoking cessation, 0.7 years from reduction of serum cholesterol to 200 mg/dl, and about 0.6 years from weight loss to ideal body weight. For women, reducing cholesterol to 200 mg/dl would have the greatest estimated impact-a gain of 0.8 years-whereas smoking cessation, blood pressure control, or weight loss would yield population-wide gains of 0.7, 0.4, and 0.4 years, respectively. Gains for 35-year-old individuals having a given risk factor are greater. We estimate that, on average, male smokers would gain 2.3 years from quitting smoking; males with hypertension would gain 1.1-5.3 years from reducing their diastolic blood pressure to 88 mm Hg; men with serum cholesterol levels exceeding 200 mg/dl would gain 0.5-4.2 years from lowering their serum cholesterol level to 200 mg/dl; and overweight men would gain an average of 0.7-1.7 years from achieving ideal body weight. Corresponding projected gains for at-risk women are 2.8 years from quitting smoking, 0.9-5.7 years from lowering blood pressure, 0.4-6.3 years from decreasing serum cholesterol, and 0.5-1.1 years from losing weight. Eliminating coronary heart disease mortality is estimated to extend the average life expectancy of a 35-year-old man by 3.1 years and a 35-year-old woman by 3.3 years. CONCLUSIONS. Population-wide gains in life expectancy from single risk-factor modifications are modest, but gains to individuals at risk can be more substantial. 
5	Synergistic effect of murine cytomegalovirus on the induction of acute graft-vs-host disease involving MHC class I differences only. Analysis of in vitro T cell function. The development of acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a common outcome after the injection of fully MHC disparate parental T cells into unirradiated F1 mice. Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection has been previously shown to augment the development of acute GVHD in the parent-into-F1 (P----F1) model, such that 10-fold fewer parental cells are required. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of MCMV infection on the induction of non-lethal GVHD that occurs in P----F1 combinations involving MHC class I only or class II only differences. Using P----F1 combinations involving either an H-2K only difference or an H-2D only difference, MCMV infection of F1 mice 3 days before the injection of parental spleen cells led to a profound T cell immunodeficiency that strongly resembled that observed in acute GVHD. Further studies examining the H-2K disparate P----F1 combination, C57Bl/6---- (C57Bl/6xB6.C-H-2bm1) F1 and combined MCMV infection showed that the immunodeficiency is characterized by a profound loss of in vitro Th cell production of IL-2 and an intrinsic defect in T effector function as shown by an inability of rIL-2 to restore defective CTL responses. Additional experiments in these mice revealed the presence of suppressor cells as well as significant parent-anti-F1 CTL activity possibly accounting for the suppressor effect. This pattern of immunodeficiency was not seen after the administration of either MCMV or MHC class I disparate parental cells alone. MCMV infection did not detectably alter the immunodeficiency observed in a P----F1 combination involving a MHC class II difference only. These results indicate that MCMV infection can alter the pattern of GVHD in the setting of an MHC class I disparity, but not in the setting of class II disparity, such that it resembles acute GVHD. These results may have relevance to the human transplant setting where intercurrent CMV infection has been associated with an adverse clinical outcome. 
1	The risk of developing subsequent nonmelanoma skin cancers. Data from the Southeast Arizona Skin Cancer Registry collected during 1985 through June 1988 were used in this study. Patients who had a nonmelanoma skin cancer (basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma) removed in 1985 were observed until subsequent nonmelanoma skin cancers developed or until June 30, 1988. Twelve categories of nonmelanoma skin cancers were developed on the basis of the type of first nonmelanoma skin cancer and type of second, third, and fourth nonmelanoma skin cancers. Analyses showed the highest risk of a subsequent nonmelanoma skin cancer developing was within 1 year (36.39%), the rate of developing another nonmelanoma skin cancer depended on type (squamous cell carcinoma, 100%; basal cell carcinoma, 44.23% to 83.65%), and total risk decreased during the 1277 days of the study. 
5	Heritability of symptoms in an experimental model of neuropathic pain. Male and female rats underwent transection and ligation of the sciatic and saphenous nerves, and the development of autonomy was monitored. The deafferented animals were then interbred, always selecting males and females that expressed relatively high and, alternatively, relatively low levels of autotomy. Offspring were similarly operated and interbred. By the sixth generation of selective breeding, lines were achieved in which autotomy was consistently high (HA) or consistently low (LA). There was no indication of sex linkage. Thermal and mechanical nocifensive responsiveness co-selected with propensity to express autotomy following nerve injury: response thresholds were lower in HA than in LA rats. F1 hybrids formed by crossing homozygous HA and LA animals showed low levels of autotomy, similar to LA stock. This indicates recessive inheritance of the autotomy trait. Backcrossing F1 hybrids onto the LA line yielded a low autotomy phenotype in almost all cases; backcrossing F1 hybrids onto HA stock yielded about 50% high autotomy and 50% low autotomy. These ratios are consistent with simple mendelian inheritance of a single gene. Taken together, the data suggest that autotomy is inherited as a single-gene autosomal recessive trait. 
5	Transesophageal echocardiographic features of normal and dysfunctioning bioprosthetic valves. Transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography and color flow Doppler were performed in patients with 42 normal and 20 dysfunctioning bioprosthetic mitral and aortic valves. Transesophageal echocardiography was superior to the transthoracic approach in delineating bioprosthetic valve cusps and the presence of valve thickening due to valve degeneration. In 27 clinically normal bioprosthetic mitral valves, regurgitation was demonstrated in three patients by the transthoracic approach and in seven by transesophageal study. Both transesophageal and transthoracic color flow Doppler demonstrated mitral regurgitation in 17 clinically regurgitant valves. The severity of mitral regurgitation was accurately assessed by the transesophageal study in all 13 patients who underwent angiography, whereas the transthoracic imaging underestimated valvular regurgitation in 7 of the 13 cases (54%). Bioprosthetic aortic valves were normal on clinical examination in 15 patients and were regurgitant in three others. Both transthoracic and transesophageal color flow Doppler were of equal value in observing and quantifying aortic regurgitation. In five clinically normal and regurgitant mitral and aortic valves, transesophageal color flow Doppler revealed eccentric regurgitant jets suggestive of paravalvular leak. This feature was not evident by the transthoracic approach. In conclusion, transesophageal echocardiography and color flow Doppler are superior to transthoracic imaging in estimating bioprosthetic mitral, but not aortic regurgitation, in differentiating valvular from paravalvular regurgitation, and in demonstrating thickened valves due to cusp degeneration. 
5	Factitious cyclic hypersomnia: a new variant of factitious disorder. The central goal of patients with factitious disorders is to receive medical care. Unnecessary diagnostic procedures and recurrent hospitalizations often ensue. We saw a 39-year-old man with a novel variation of this disorder: factitious cyclic hypersomnia, or the simulation of recurrent episodes of excessive sleep. This case highlights the observations that patients whose illnesses are simulated may have diverse symptoms, that no syndrome is immune to factitious imitation, and that attempts at treatment, though exceedingly challenging, are always contingent upon appropriate recognition. 
5	Long-term memory of acute postsurgical pain. The long-term memory of acute postoperative pain intensity was evaluated in a population of patients who had undergone the removal of impacted third molar teeth. The results suggest a positive correlation between experienced and remembered intensities of postsurgical pain for up to 3 years after surgery. They also suggest that males and females do not differ significantly in their reports of postsurgical pain intensity, nor do they differ significantly in their memories of pain intensity. Pain recall using verbal pain descriptors was more reliable than recall with visual analog scales. Patient reports of intensity of past postsurgical acute pain, particularly those reports obtained with verbal descriptors, may be useful in the planning of treatment and in the selection and evaluation of analgesic regimens. 
5	Respiratory symptoms and risk factors in an Arizona population sample of Anglo and Mexican-American whites. Prevalence rates of respiratory symptoms and diseases in a large group of Anglos and Mexican-Americans were analyzed. Each subject completed a questionnaire. Among current smokers, chronic productive cough and dyspnea were significantly higher in both ethnic groups; wheezy symptoms were higher in Anglos. There were no significant differences in the symptom prevalence rates between the two groups, after stratifying by current cigarette consumption and CRT. The spirometric values were not significantly different. In both ethnic groups, the prevalence rates of wheeze, SOBWHZ and asthma were significantly higher in those who had CRT. Among Anglos, less educated smokers had significantly higher prevalence rates of SOBWHZ and dyspnea; nonsmokers with less education had higher prevalence rates of cough, chronic cough and dyspnea. Our results confirm the importance of CRT and lower educational level as risk factors for respiratory symptoms. Ethnicity is not associated with symptomatology or lung function impairment. 
2	Portal vein resection with a new antithrombogenic catheter. Curative resection of pancreatic and hepatobiliary tumors is rarely possible because of local invasion, especially into the portal vein. We developed a new antithrombogenic catheter using a heparinized hydrophilic polymer to allow portal vein bypass during resection of tumors invading the portal vein. Pancreatectomy or hepatectomy accompanied by portal vein resection was performed for pancreatic or hepatobiliary cancer, with an intraoperative shunt from the superior mesenteric vein to the femoral vein or from the superior mesenteric vein to the intrahepatic portal vein through the umbilical vein or the hepatic hilar portal vein. Use of the shunt prevented stasis in the superior mesenteric vein and hepatic ischemia even during prolonged occlusion of the portal vein, and portal vein resection was performed in 81 patients with hepatobiliary and pancreatic disease with greater safety and ease. 
1	Conservation surgery for glomus jugulare tumors: the value of early diagnosis. The results of lateral cranial base surgery for glomus jugulare tumors are gratifying when normal anatomy and function can be preserved. The goal of conservation surgery is to preserve normal ear anatomy and cranial nerve function. In general, conservation surgery is tumor-size dependent. Thus, excellent states of functional recovery depend upon accurate early diagnosis. This paper reviews the technical aspects of transtemporal conservation skull base tumor surgery while also reviewing our experience with nearly 100 glomus jugulare patients. Adjuvants to early diagnosis will be highlighted from a review of presenting symptoms, clinical signs, and related diagnosis. Our objective is to provoke a high index of suspicion in physicians charged with the responsibility of diagnosing these tumors. Diagnostic guidelines are proposed. 
2	Recurrence rate after discontinuation of long-term mebendazole therapy in alveolar echinococcosis (preliminary results). The recurrence rate was investigated in 19 patients with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis after discontinuation of a long-term therapy with mebendazole (average treatment 4.3 years). A control group consisted of 14 patients who underwent radical surgery and finished a course of prophylactic postoperative mebendazole treatment of 2 years. In the controls, no recurrence was observed after a post-therapy period averaging 3.5 years. In contrast, recurrence occurred in 7/19 patients (37%) with non-resectable alveolar echinococcosis an average of 1.6 years after discontinuation of the long-term mebendazole therapy. The absence of clinically detectable recurrence in the remaining 12 patients seems to be due either to spontaneous inactivation of alveolar echinococcosis preceding chemotherapy or too short post-therapy surveillance. The patients with recurrence responded favorably to reintroduction of chemotherapy. The data indicate that mebendazole therapy is parasitostatic rather than parasiticidal. 
5	Cyclophosphamide-induced hemorrhagic pyelitis and ureteritis associated with cystitis in marrow transplantation. A 29-year-old woman suffered fatal hemorrhagic pyelitis, ureteritis and cystitis after receiving 4,800 mg./m.2 cyclophosphamide in preparation for marrow transplantation despite intravenous hydration and a Foley catheter. Cyclophosphamide-induced urothelial damage is not limited to the bladder and upper tract monitoring also is necessary. 
4	Fenestrated atrial septal aneurysm: diagnosis by transesophageal echocardiography. The diagnosis of atrial septal defect by transthoracic echocardiography remains difficult in a small subset of patients because of either suboptimal acoustic windows or unusual anatomy, for example, fenestrated defects. We report the case of a 55-year-old woman with a fenestrated atrial septal aneurysm that was incompletely visualized by transthoracic echocardiography. Subsequent transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated three defects within the atrial septal aneurysm with left-to-right shunting across each defect. Normal pulmonary venous connections were also defined. All echocardiographic findings were confirmed at surgery. This case demonstrates the additional diagnostic accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography for detecting disease of the atrial septum. 
5	Traumatic subarachnoid-pleural fistula in a child. A case report. A seven-year-old girl sustained a gunshot wound to the chest and spine. Evaluation of a persistent pleural effusion demonstrated a subarachnoid-pleural fistula. Surgical closure of the dural defect resulted in resolution of the fistula. Traumatic subarachnoid-pleural fistulae are rare. The diagnosis is reached by an awareness of fistula formation from penetrating or blunt trauma to the chest. 
1	Acquired cisplatin resistance in human ovarian cancer cells is associated with enhanced repair of cisplatin-DNA lesions and reduced drug accumulation. Studies were undertaken to investigate acquired resistance to cisplatin in human ovarian cancer cells. The cell lines A2780 and A2780/CP70 were studied to assess their respective characteristics of drug accumulation and efflux, cytosolic inactivation of drug, and DNA repair. All experiments were performed using 1-h drug exposures. The A2780/CP70 cell line was 13-fold more resistant to cisplatin than A2780 cells. When studied at their respective IC50 doses, drug accumulation rates were similar for the two cell lines. However, the resistant cell line was twofold more efficient at effluxing drug, which was associated with reduced total drug accumulation for equivalent micromolar drug exposures. At equivalent levels of total cellular drug accumulation, the two cell lines formed the same levels of cisplatin-DNA damage, suggesting that cytosolic inactivation of drug does not contribute to the differential in resistance between these cell lines. Resistant cells were also twofold more efficient at repairing cisplatin-DNA lesions in cellular DNA and in transfected plasmid DNA. We conclude that in these paired cell lines, alterations in drug uptake/efflux and in DNA repair are the major contributing factors to acquired resistance to cisplatin. 
4	Arterial abnormalities of the hand in athletes. Vascular lesions of the hand may be seen in athletes exposed to repetitive blunt trauma. Thirteen athletes seen from 1983 to 1988 experienced symptoms related to hand ischemia. Nine were professional baseball catchers. The majority of patients complained of chronic symptoms, including cold hypersensitivity (four patients), finger numbness (one), finger coolness (three), and finger blanching (three). Two patients had acute symptoms with sudden posttraumatic hand ischemia with finger and palmar pain. Diagnosis was established by history and physical examination and confirmed by noninvasive testing. Testing included use of Doppler examination and cold tolerance examination with thermistors. Two athletes required angiographic evaluation because of severe ischemia and continuous pain. All patients in this group were managed nonoperatively. Those with chronic complaints were counseled regarding cold avoidance and instructed to increase their glove padding. The two patients with acute symptoms required vasodilator (papaverine chloride) infusion, followed by intravenous heparin and dextran. All baseball catchers returned to their sport with dissipation of symptoms. 
1	Long-term results of operation for non-small cell lung cancer in the elderly. We surgically treated 185 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who were 70 years old or older. The operative mortality rate was 3%, and the 5-year survival rate was 48%. The mortality and prognosis were similar to those in younger patients. The number of elderly patients who smoked heavily or who had ventilatory defects was high, but the incidence of pneumonectomy was low. There were no differences based on age in regard to histological type, TNM classification, and curability. Pulmonary complications occurred in 21% of the elderly patients and were correlated with preoperative pulmonary function and smoking habits. When the elderly are to undergo elective pulmonary resection for lung cancer, the preoperative evaluation of pulmonary function should be thorough, and both preoperative and postoperative physical therapy should be given. If postoperative pulmonary function is predicted to be less than 0.8 L/m2 of vital capacity and 0.6 L/m2 of forced expiratory volume in 1 second, a limited resection or nonsurgical therapy should be considered. 
1	Carotid artery resection and replacement in patients with head and neck malignant tumors. Tumor involvement of the carotid artery with head and neck cancers may be present either simultaneously with the primary lesion or more often appears at a later date following resection of the primary tumor. Management of the secondary tumor consists of its resection together with the involved carotid artery with or without carotid artery reconstruction. The Authors are convinced that the best chance for cure of patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers involving the carotid artery is radical extirpation with ablative surgery in the form of en block resection of the primary lesion, the secondary tumor, and the involved carotid artery followed by immediate revascularization. This bold approach was carried out in two male patients, 48 and 61 years of age, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy in one and radiation therapy alone in the other, with excellent results. Dermal grafts were placed over the entire length of the arterialized veins to protect them from radiation injury. Based on this limited experience and excellent results, we recommend this one-stage surgical ablative procedure in well selected patients. However, cooperation between the ENT and vascular surgeons, strict adherence to the principles and techniques of vascular surgery, and coverage of the arterialized vein with a dermal graft is absolutely essential. 
5	Effect of prednisolone treatment in chronic silicosis. We evaluated the effects of daily oral prednisolone therapy on alveolitis parameters and pulmonary function tests over a 6-month period in patients with chronic silicosis. Pulmonary function tests were done in 34 patients, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was done in 21 of them. Pulmonary function tests showed a significant improvement in lung volumes, FEV1, PEFR, SGaw, DLCO, and PaO2. Analysis of BAL fluid revealed a significant decrease in total cell count. Mean fibronectin and immunoglobulin values in BAL fluid also were lower after treatment, but the change was not statistically significant. No serious side effects were encountered with prednisolone therapy. These results indicate that daily oral prednisolone therapy may suppress the alveolitis in certain patients with chronic silicosis and bring about a significant improvement in lung functions and gas exchange. 
2	Evolution of fundic argyrophil cell hyperplasia in nonantral atrophic gastritis. Fundic argyrophil cells were studied for a mean period of 68.7 months (range, 11-170) in 18 patients with fundic atrophic gastritis and achlorhydria. Initially, 12 patients had hyperplasia of the argyrophil cells, the severity of which was assessed using a semiquantitative classification based on the number of argyrophil clusters per square millimeter. At the end of the study, the degree of hyperplasia was unchanged in 9 patients, had decreased in 2, and had increased in 1; no significant increase in the number of argyrophil clusters, precarcinoid changes, or carcinoid tumors were observed and the high level of gastrinemia [mean, 4.8 (range, 1.9-8.1) times the upper limit for normal) did not change significantly. Of the 6 patients with no hyperplasia at the outset of the study, 4 continued without hyperplasia and 2 presented a low-grade hyperplasia at the 20th and 130th month. Gastrinemia increased significantly in the last patient and stayed normal in the other 5. This study argues in favor of the stable appearance of fundic argyrophil cells in patients with atrophic gastritis and stable gastrinemia. 
1	Is preoperative ultrasound cancer survey necessary in patients with normal liver function tests? Abdominal ultrasound examination is so easy that it may be overused. To reduce medical costs, we investigated whether preoperative ultrasonic abdominal survey was necessary for oncologic patients with normal liver function tests. We used the ultrasound diagnosis as the final standard to test the value of liver function tests for the prediction of liver metastases. Five hundred forty-four patients with various primary malignancies were referred for preoperative ultrasonic survey of the abdomen. The results showed that for a single test, serum albumin was most sensitive (87.2%) but least specific (29.4%), and serum bilirubin was least sensitive (13.0%) but most specific (97.2%), for the prediction of liver metastases. For a combination of five tests or more, the sensitivity was 95.9% and the specificity 29.5%. In patients with normal liver function tests, liver metastases were detected by ultrasound in two of 106 (1.9%) patients. One hundred of 544 (18.4%) patients having major abnormalities that may influence clinical management were also detected during the ultrasound examination. We conclude that ultrasound is convenient, cheap, and without side effects. It can provide additional information affecting patient management, even in the presence of normal liver function tests. 
3	Intractable complex partial seizures associated with occult temporal lobe encephalocele and meningoangiomatosis: a case report. Occult congenital temporal lobe encephalocele has rarely been reported in association with medically intractable complex partial seizures. The four previously reported cases were unsuspected preoperatively. We present the case of an 18-year-old woman with intractable complex partial seizures since age 13. Seizure onset was electrically localized to the right temporal lobe. Preoperative neuroimaging studies revealed a middle fossa defect and inferior herniation of the right temporal lobe. Pathologic examination of the resected encephalocele revealed prominent features of meningoangiomatosis. We believe this to be the first case of temporal lobe encephalocele and epilepsy to be diagnosed preoperatively, and the first case also to be associated with meningoangiomatosis. The relevant literature on meningoangiomatosis and on temporal lobe encephalocele as a cause of epilepsy is reviewed. 
4	Hemodynamic effects of nebivolol at rest and on exertion in patients with heart failure. Nebivolol is a novel B-1-adrenoceptor-blocking drug with an unusual hemodynamic profile unlike classical B-blockers. In dogs and in healthy volunteers it decreases blood pressure and heart rate but improves left ventricular function. The authors studied 10 male patients with coronary artery disease and heart failure (ejection fraction mean = 46%). A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed into the pulmonary artery, and the mean blood pressure, the heart rate, the pulmonary artery pressure, the pulmonary wedge pressure, the right atrial pressure, the cardiac output, and the stroke volume were measured at rest and on exertion before and after seven days' treatment with oral nebivolol (5 mg/day). While the blood pressure and the heart rate decreased significantly, the pulmonary artery and wedge pressures, as well as the right atrial pressure and the cardiac output, did not change during treatment. The stroke volume increased significantly. The maintained cardiac output cannot be explained by any changes in preload or afterload; instead a positive inotropic mechanism must be assumed. Unlike other B-blockers it seems to be possible to treat patients with heart failure with nebivolol without causing the hemodynamic situation to deteriorate. 
3	Interferon system and natural killer cell activity in myasthenia gravis. The autoimmune response in myasthenia gravis is well characterized, but little is known about the mechanisms initiating it. We have studied the interferon system and natural killer cell activity in 25 patients with myasthenia gravis and compared them to 68 healthy subjects and 96 patients with acute viral infections. Forty-four per cent of patients had circulating interferon (greater than 16 mu/ml), and in a similar proportion their peripheral blood mononuclear cells were in an antiviral state, i.e., showed low levels of viral replication when infected by vesicular stomatitis virus. Spontaneous in vitro interferon production by patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells was also common (greater than 10 mu/ml, 32 per cent), while the response to the alpha-interferon inducer poly I:C was lower than expected, possibly reflecting the already high state of activation of the interferon system. These results were essentially similar to those obtained in patients with viral illnesses and differed significantly from healthy controls. In many myasthenia gravis patients (16 of 22, 73 per cent), a markedly deficient natural killer cell activity was found, with a median cytotoxicity of 6.5 per cent compared to 29 per cent in healthy subjects (p less than 0.005). Thus, many patients with myasthenia gravis have evidence of an activated interferon system and defective natural killer cell activity, suggesting an occult viral infection or reflecting nonspecific stimulation which may nevertheless contribute to the pathogenesis of the autoimmune response. 
5	Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques. The status of hepatitis B virus DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in multifocal areas of a noncancerous hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis. This liver exhibited a marked degree of dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathology and immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B core and surface antigens. There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature. 
2	Properties of strains of Escherichia coli O26:H11 in relation to their enteropathogenic or enterohemorrhagic classification. Thirty-seven strains of Escherichia coli O26:H11 from infants and calves with diarrhea were examined for properties associated with enteropathogenic (EPEC) or enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Strains were heterogeneous with respect to Vero cytotoxin (VT) production and hybridization with the EHEC plasmid-specific (CVD419) probe; 26 strains produced VT1; 1 produced VT2. Twenty-four of 27 VT+ strains and 5 of 10 VT- strains hybridized with the CVD419 probe and produced enterohemolysin; these properties are characteristic of EHEC. The strains did not hybridize with the EPEC adherence factor probe, a property characteristic of some EPEC. Nevertheless, 36 strains adhered to HEp-2 cells in a localized manner and were positive by the fluorescence actin staining (FAS) test that is considered to correlate with the ability to cause attaching and effacing lesions in vivo. EPEC and EHEC cause these lesions. Although the FAS test appeared to be the most general pathogenicity test for the O26:H11 strains, it could not be used to assign strains specifically to EPEC or EHEC groups. 
1	Primary chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy and/or surgery for children with localized sarcoma of the bladder, prostate, vagina, uterus, and cervix. A comparison of the results in Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Studies I and II. A major objective of the second Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study (IRS-II) (1978 to 1984) was to preserve the bladder without compromising the survival of children with localized genitourinary sarcomas arising in or near the bladder. After incisional biopsy, 109 patients with localized, gross residual sarcoma of the prostate (43 patients), bladder (43 patients), vagina (20 patients), or cervix/uterine corpus (3 patients) were treated with vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC). After two to four drug courses, radiation therapy and/or surgery were used to treat patients with residual or recurrent tumor. The 3-year survival rate of patients treated on this primary chemotherapy regimen (70%) was similar to that of the primary surgery regimens of IRS-I (78%; P = 0.46), but the 3-year disease-free survival rate was significantly inferior (52% versus 70%; P = 0.02). Since the IRS-II encouraged bladder preservation at the onset of therapy, the percentage of patients with bladder and prostate tumors who retained the bladder was initially substantially higher in IRS-II (97%) than in IRS-I (58%). However, the percentages of 95 patients with bladder-prostate (BP) tumors in IRS-II who retained the bladder and were alive at 2 and 3 years after starting treatment were only 33% and 22%, respectively, compared with 26% and 23%, respectively, in the 66 patients with BP tumors in IRS-I. Thus, sequential treatment with primary chemotherapy, followed by radiation therapy and/or surgery as given in IRS-II, failed to improve the eventual bladder salvage rate. 
1	Urological manifestations of HIV-related disease. A case of AIDS-associated testicular seminoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and possible intracranial lymphoma. A wide variety of pathologies afflicting the genitourinary tract can be displayed by patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), including both infective and neoplastic conditions. Treatment can often be offered for such conditions using a combination of therapeutic approaches. These conditions should be looked for specifically in patients with HIV infection as treatment may improve their quality of life. A case is presented of a testicular seminoma (appearing in association with an intracranial mass and Kaposi's sarcoma) in a male patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); he made a good response to orchiectomy and radiotherapy for his seminoma. A short review is also given of the range of HIV-associated genitourinary pathologies which have been described to date. 
4	Treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis with intermittent high-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide PURPOSE: Concerns regarding the long-term toxicity of daily cyclophosphamide (CP) therapy for the systemic vasculitides have led us to evaluate alternative approaches to treatment in an attempt to achieve comparable efficacy with less toxicity. This study sought to determine the efficacy, toxicity, and immunologic effects of glucocorticoids (GC) and intermittent high-dose intravenous CP ("pulse" CP) in the treatment of 14 patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis of active WG was supported by a typical clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of vasculitis, granulomatous inflammation, and tissue necrosis. GC treatment was initially provided on a daily basis and later tapered to an alternate-day schedule if vasculitis remained inactive. Pulse CP treatment was initially administered once a month for 6 months. If after 6 months remission had been attained and GC therapy had been discontinued, then pulse CP treatment was given at less frequent intervals thereafter. Treatment and evaluation were provided for participants as inpatients in a clinical research center (National Institutes of Health). RESULTS: Thirteen of 14 patients (93%) initially experienced unequivocal improvement with pulse CP therapy, and seven of 14 (50%) achieved remission within 4 months. However, treatment was associated with significant toxicity in two patients and later relapses in nine patients, so that a total of 79% either failed to achieve sustained remission or were unable to continue therapy. Three of 14 (21%) patients have achieved sustained remissions with the pulse CP protocol and one additional patient (who had a limited exacerbation of WG) continues to receive that therapy after 14 to 22 months (mean 17 months). CONCLUSIONS: The use of pulse CP and GC therapy in 14 patients with WG was associated with a high initial response rate. However, failure to respond initially to treatment, to sustain improvement, or to tolerate continued treatment was noted in 79% of patients within a period of 1 to 22 months. These observations indicate that this particular pulse CP protocol does not achieve a high degree of lasting efficacy. 
1	Management of Cushing's syndrome secondary to adrenal adenoma during pregnancy. This report discusses our experience with two patients who had unilateral adrenalectomy during pregnancy as treatment for Cushing's syndrome secondary to an adrenal adenoma. Previously only five patients with this clinical problem who underwent unilateral adrenalectomy during pregnancy had been reported. We have reviewed the world literature on Cushing's syndrome in pregnancy secondary to an adrenal adenoma. A total of 19 patients who had unilateral adrenalectomy for this problem after the completion of pregnancy were identified. The review of world literature and the two patients who are the subject of this report were the basis of our analysis of fetal death, neonatal complications, and maternal complications in seven pregnancies during which unilateral adrenalectomy was performed (group 1) compared to the 19 pregnancies that were associated with unilateral adrenalectomy at the completion of pregnancy (group 2). Of the seven pregnancies in group 1, one fetal death and no neonatal complications occurred, but fetal death and neonatal complications occurred in 12 of the 19 pregnancies in group 2. Four of the seven mothers in group 1 had complications; 16 of the 19 mothers in group 2 had complications. This study suggests that adrenalectomy during pregnancy should be considered as a therapeutic option in the management of Cushing's syndrome secondary to an adrenal cortical adenoma. 
2	Septic Streptococcus milleri spondylodiscitis. We describe 2 patients presenting lumbar spondylitis due to Streptococcus milleri. In both cases origin was related to preexistent intestinal pathology. Surgical drainage of a collection of pus was necessary in one case. Longterm antibiotic therapy led to full recovery. Despite confused nomenclature Streptococcus milleri must be considered a serious pathogen mainly associated with purulent infection with osteoarticular affinity. 
1	Comparison of FRTL-5 cell growth in vitro with that of xenotransplanted cells and the thyroid of the recipient mouse. The present work was designed to compare in vitro cell growth kinetics with in vivo growth under conditions as similar as possible using labeling with [3H]thymidine. To this purpose, FRTL-5 cells were cultured as monolayers and as three-dimensional spheroids embedded in collagen gels and transplanted simultaneously into nude mice treated with perchlorate and a low iodine diet. The growth of the transplants was compared to that of the thyroids in host mice. In the intact thyroid, the fraction of [3H]thymidine-labeled follicular cells (FLC; 24-h labeling) increased sluggishly to a maximum of 10% after 3 weeks of goitrogen exposure, with a subsequent autoregulatory decrease to 3% at 7 weeks. A 4-fold higher FLC was found in six adenomas, indicating focal failure of growth-restraining mechanisms. In nonconfluent monolayer cultures the FLC was as high as 90%, even within large individual clusters where cells are in tight mutual contact. Solid, highly cellular grafts growing from transplanted monodispersed cells showed an average FLC of 20%, which is 5 times higher than the FLC in the identically stimulated mouse thyroid. In collagen-embedded cells, forming three-dimensional spheroids, the mean FLC decreased from 70% at 1 week in vitro (40% in vivo) to 20% at 3 weeks both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting effective auto-regulation of excessive growth in both conditions. However, these FLC were again much higher than the 3% FLC in simultaneously assessed host thyroids. The difference remained throughout the 45-day period studied. We conclude that FRTL-5 cells growing as monolayers and as three-dimensional spheroids in vitro or after xenotransplantation in vivo invariably show much higher proliferation rates under comparable environmental conditions than the normal follicular epithelium in the thyroids of host mice. The one exception is the confluent monolayer with near-zero growth, while densely packed three-dimensional transplants still grow intensively. Although growth-retarding cell to cell interactions are also clearly operative in growing FRTL-5 cells, they are less effective than those dampening the replication rate of the thyrocytes within the monolayer hull of normal follicles. A local failure of these mechanisms, allowing growth rates comparable to those of grafted FRTL-5 cells results in adenoma formation in normal thyroids. These observations call for caution in the transfer of in vitro growth studies with FRTL-5 cells to in vivo conditions prevailing in the normal thyroid. 
3	The neck-eye reflex in patients with reduced vestibular and optokinetic function. It is accepted that the neck-eye loop (cervico-ocular reflex, COR) is enhanced following loss of vestibular function and that this helps to restore gaze stability during head movements. In this paper we address the question of which structures and/or mechanisms may participate in such plastic enhancement by investigating the COR in 2 patients with absent vestibular function and reduced smooth pursuit-optokinetic eye movements (SP-OKN). The patients had multisystem atrophy involving the vestibular system and the cerebellum. The COR (elicited by angular motion of the trunk relative to the fixed head and angular motion of the head relative to the fixed trunk) was not enhanced in these 2 patients when compared with normal subjects, in contrast to previous findings in a group of patients with absent vestibular function alone. Measurements of slow phase eye movement velocity during SP-OKN stimuli and during combined COR-OKN stimulation (head oscillation relative to the stationary trunk in the light) showed identical values in these two conditions, which indicates that the neck-eye loop did not contribute to gaze stability during head movements. The absence of plastic enhancement of the COR in these patients may be secondary to interruption of SP-OKN pathways at various possible sites and/or to involvement of the vestibulocerebellum, which is known to mediate adaptive plasticity in the vestibulo-ocular reflex. 
1	Perinatal infection of human T-lymphotropic virus type I, the etiologic virus of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. DNA amplification of specific human T-lymphotropic virus type I sequences. A gene amplification technique, polymerase chain reaction, was used to detect human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), the etiologic agent of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, in mononuclear cells in peripheral blood and breast milk of ten HTLV-I carrier gravida. The DNA in umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells of the neonates born to the HTLV-I carrier gravida were also amplified and examined for the possibility of HTLV-I infection via placenta during pregnancy. The HTLV-I sequences were detected both in the peripheral blood and milk of all ten carrier gravida by Southern blot analysis of amplified DNA. However, HTLV-I proviral DNA could not be detected in the cord blood of the carriers' neonates, indicating that transplacental infection of HTLV-I should be rare and that postpartum infection via breast milk is a likely major perinatal transmission route. 
5	Long-chain (sphingoid) bases inhibit multistage carcinogenesis in mouse C3H/10T1/2 cells treated with radiation and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. Sphingosine and other long-chain (sphingoid) bases inhibit protein kinase C, the putative cellular receptor for the tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and exert potent effects on diverse cell functions. We tested the ability of long-chain bases to modulate multistage carcinogenesis in mouse C3H/10T1/2 cells exposed to gamma-rays and PMA. Sphingosine and sphinganine completely blocked the enhancement of radiation-induced transformation by PMA (promotion) and partially suppressed transformation by radiation alone. N-Acetylsphingosine, a ceramide analog, did not inhibit transformation. Sphingosine was rapidly taken up by the cells and metabolized; hence, the long-chain bases were added daily to achieve prolonged inhibition. Long-chain bases inhibited protein kinase C activity in C3H/10T1/2 cells and suppressed the down-regulation of this enzyme by PMA. Our results establish that long-chain bases are highly effective inhibitors of carcinogenesis in this model. Our results also indicate that the suppressive effects may be mediated, in part, by inhibition of protein kinase C. The data suggest that sphingosine and other long-chain bases derived from complex sphingolipids may act as cancer-preventative agents. 
5	Low-molecular-weight heparinoid compared with warfarin for prophylaxis of deep-vein thrombosis in patients who are operated on for fracture of the hip. A prospective, randomized trial. In a randomized, prospective trial, a low-molecular-weight heparinoid (Org 10172 [Lomoparan]) was compared with warfarin for efficacy and safety in preventing deep-vein thrombosis in 263 patients who had an operatively treated fracture of the hip. One group of patients received Org 10172 in a dose of 750 units subcutaneously every twelve hours until the ninth postoperative day; on the seventh postoperative day, warfarin was added to the regimen. The other group received only warfarin. Both drugs were begun preoperatively, immediately after the admission evaluation. In the patients who received warfarin, the desired prothrombin time was one and one-half times the control level. Deep-vein thrombosis was detected by 125I-fibrinogen scanning and impedance plethysmography and was confirmed by phlebography and compression ultrasonography. Deep-vein thrombosis was found in nine (7 per cent) of the 132 patients who received Org 10172 and in twenty-eight (21 per cent) of the 131 patients who received warfarin (p less than 0.001). Adverse reactions were not significantly different in the two groups. Major bleeding complications occurred in eight patients in the Org-10172 group, only four of whom were receiving the drug at the time of bleeding, and in five patients who were receiving warfarin (not significant). There was no difference in intraoperative loss of blood or in requirements for transfusion. We concluded that the low-molecular-weight heparinoid Org 10172 is a safe, convenient, effective antithrombotic agent for the prevention of venous thrombosis after an operation for fracture of the hip. 
1	Use of Mohs micrographic surgery to establish quantitative proof of heightened tumor spread in basal cell carcinoma recurrent following radiotherapy. We compared 27 basal-cell carcinomas (BCCs) recurrent following radiotherapy and subsequently excised by Mohs micrographic surgery to a control group of BCCs recurrent following other treatment modalities and similarly excised. Mohs technique permitted precise, quantitative tumor assessment, obtained via a novel method utilizing three parameters: the number of surgical stages required for complete excision, the percentage increase between clinical preoperative tumor area and final postoperative defect area, and the presence of deep subcutaneous tissue invasion. Figures for the postradiation group were larger in all three categories, with the latter two revealing statistically significant differences versus the nonradiation group. This study gives strong, direct quantitative support to the clinical impression that BCC recurrent following radiotherapy is a uniquely aggressive, invasive subset of recurrent BCC. 
4	Clinical validation of a miniature nuclear probe system for continuous on-line monitoring of cardiac function and ST-segment A new, miniature cesium iodide/photodiode nuclear probe (the "Cardioscint") has been developed for continuous on-line measurement of left ventricular function and the ST-segment. Ejection fraction (EF) measurements in 77 patients were compared with gated equilibrium radionuclide ventriculograms. The probe was positioned over the left ventricle by first using a blind positioning algorithm and then by using the gamma camera. Background was measured both manually and automatically. There was good correlation between probe (positioned blind) and gamma camera EF with both manual (r = 0.80, n = 65) and automatic (r = 0.78, n = 66) backgrounds. Use of the gamma camera did not significantly alter the results. Correlation between the probe stroke counts and thermodilution-derived stroke index during atrial pacing in six subjects was also satisfactory (r = 0.69, n = 102). Thus, the Cardioscint is able to provide a reliable estimate of EF and can track rapid changes in cardiac volumes. 
1	Mechanisms associated with the generation of biologically active human immunodeficiency virus type 1 particles from defective proviruses. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the etiological agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV exhibits extensive genetic diversity and it is apparent that an infected individual contains different populations of distinct viral strains, a large proportion of which has been found surprisingly to be defective for replication. A similar phenomenon has also been observed with some cell lines that are known to produce infectious viral particles but harbor defective proviral genomes. Here, we investigated the molecular basis of this phenomenon by cloning proviral genomes of HIV from a cell line that was capable of producing high titers of biologically active HIV particles that readily induced syncytia with CD4+ cell lines and peripheral blood lymphocytes. This cell line was found to contain five proviral genomes, all of which, when tested individually, failed to produce replication-competent viruses upon transfection into human cells. However, when a specific combination of two proviral genomes was used in such transfection studies, it was possible to obtain biologically active, replication-competent viral particles that infected and replicated in CD4+ cell lines and induced syncytia characteristic of HIV. Such a result may be due to homologous recombination between proviral DNAs occurring in cells after transfection and/or complementation of replication-defective proviral DNAs. The diploid nature of the viral RNA genome present in the viral particle may enable the persistence of defective HIV genomes. 
4	Thromboxane biosynthesis in cardiovascular diseases. Sudden fissuring of an atherosclerotic plaque has been suggested as the primary trigger of transient spontaneous ischemia in both the coronary and cerebral circulation. Measurements of urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 and 2,3-dinor-TXB2, as well as results of Aspirin trials, have suggested that episodic platelet activation at the site of this acute vascular lesion is mediated, at least partly, by enhanced thromboxane (TX) A2 biosynthesis. Thus, episodic increases in metabolite excretion have been detected in unstable angina. Aspirin (75-325 mg/day) prevents about one third of all fatal and nonfatal thrombotic events in this setting. That a similar "dynamic" thrombotic process occurs during the early phase of acute myocardial infarction is suggested by thromboxane metabolite measurements and by the results of the ISIS-2 trial showing a similar impact of short-term Aspirin therapy to that seen in unstable angina. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is associated with transiently enhanced TXA2 biosynthesis and Aspirin-suppressable periprocedural thrombotic complications. On the other hand, both non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and type IIa hypercholesterolemia are associated with a relatively reproducible and persisting abnormality of TXA2-dependent platelet function. This association is likely to reflect a systemic rather than localized stimulus to platelet activation and a continuous rather than episodic alteration. Low-dose (50 mg/day) Aspirin can largely suppress thromboxane metabolite excretion in both diseases. Thus, low-dose Aspirin and/or selective prostaglandin H2/TXA2-receptor antagonists may be important tools to test the hypothesis that TXA2-dependent platelet activation represents an important transducer of the enhanced thrombotic risk associated with these metabolic abnormalities. 
3	99mTc HM-PAO SPECT in pediatric migraine. 99mTC HM-PAO SPECT brain imaging was performed during the headache-free period in 19 young migraineurs, affected by common migraine (CM, 10 cases), classic migraine (CLM, 6 cases) and hemiplegic migraine (HM, 3 cases). SPECT findings were negative in all 10 patients with CM, in 3 cases of CLM and in 2 cases of HM. Positive findings in the remaining 4 patients (3 cases of CLM and 1 of HM) showed a decreased tracer distribution in the temporo-occipital regions (2 cases) and parietal regions (2 cases): the two with decreased temporo-occipital perfusion reported prodromal symptoms exclusively contralateral to the areas of hypoperfusion. An impaired regional cerebral vascular autoregulation may exist even during headache-free intervals in patients suffering from classic and hemiplegic migraine. 
2	Incisional hernioplasty with Mersilene. Thirty large incisional abdominal hernias (myoaponeurotic defects greater than 10 centimeters) were successfully repaired by a technique of incisional hernioplasty which implants a large Mersilene (polyester fiber) prosthesis in the space between the abdominal muscles and the peritoneum. The prosthesis extends far beyond the borders of the myoaponeurotic defect, and is solidly held in place by intra-abdominal pressure and later by fibrous ingrowth. The prosthesis protects against recurrence in two ways. First, it prevents peritoneal eventration by adhering to the visceral sac and rendering it indistensible. Second, the prosthesis unites and consolidates the abdominal wall. Consequently, the procedure uniquely exploits the very force which caused the hernia to prevent a recurrence. A prosthesis of Mersilene is essential for success because it is supple and elastic enough to conform freely to the curvatures of the visceral sac, has the necessary grainy texture to grip the peritoneum and prevent slippage and is reactive enough to induce a rapid fibroblastic response to ensure fixation. 
4	Bone mineral density in spontaneous hypertension: differential effects of dietary calcium and sodium. Dietary calcium and sodium have been postulated to modify both bone mineral status and blood pressure regulation in humans and animals. The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) manifests several defects in calcium metabolism that may contribute to its hypertension. Blood pressure and bone mineral status were measured in SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) as a marker of whole animal calcium metabolism. In addition, the effect of alterations in dietary calcium and sodium on bone status were examined. At 6 weeks of age, seven male SHR and seven male WKY were placed on a control diet. At the same age, 28 SHR and 28 WKY were randomized to four diets containing either 2.0% or 0.1% calcium and 1.0% or 0.25% sodium. Four markers of bone mineral status were analyzed: bone density measured by direct photon absorptiometry, and total bone calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium content measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The SHR exhibited significantly lower levels (p less than 0.001) of bone density and bone magnesium content than the WKY, whereas bone phosphorus and calcium did not differ between the two strains. The 2.0% calcium diets resulted in increased bone density and bone calcium content, and lower bone magnesium in both strains. The 1.0% sodium diets were associated with decreased bone density in the SHR, but not in the WKY. These findings identify another indicator of disturbed calcium metabolism in the SHR that may be related to impaired renal calcium handling. They are consistent with previously reported reductions in renal calcium reabsorption and decreased intestinal calcium transport in older SHR. 
5	Spherical connective tissue inclusions in epithelial hyperplasia of the breast ("collagenous spherulosis"). Partial myoepithelial differentiation is common in simple epithelial hyperplasia (epitheliosis) of the breast but functional myoepithelial differentiation with basement membrane production is exceedingly rare. A peculiar change of hyaline globules within benign epithelial hyperplasia has been recognised before as "collagenous spherulosis" and type IV collagen has been shown by immunohistochemistry. Another seven cases are described which show the presence of laminin and collagens IV and III within the proliferation. Electron microscopy examination of two cases using material retrieved from the wax block showed varying degrees of myoepithelial differentiation of the cells immediately surrounding the spherules and basal lamina material, including mature collagen fibrils in one case. The degree of myoepithelial differentiation of the cells surrounding the spherules seemed to correlate with the differing types and amounts of extracellular matrix in the spherule. Histopathologists should be aware of this rare change as it may be misinterpreted as in situ carcinoma. 
3	Daytime hypertension in obstructive sleep apnea. Prevalence and contributing risk factors. We examined the prevalence of daytime hypertension in a modern sample of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and assessed the relative risk factors contributing to the development of hypertension in this disorder. Daytime hypertension was present in 92 (45 percent) of 206 male and female patients with OSA. Stepwise logistic regression revealed that only age and body mass index (BMI) were predictors of hypertension in this population. A subsample of 152 male patients with OSA was then compared to 904 men identified from a geographically and ethnically similar general population. When one controlled for age and BMI, the prevalence of hypertension in the two groups was the same except for those aged 25 to 44 years who were markedly obese (BMI greater than 31 kg/m2). In this group, 47 percent of the patients with OSA were hypertensive vs 26 percent of control subjects (p less than 0.05). Our data suggest that the high prevalence of hypertension in OSA is primarily related to age and the excess obesity seen in these patients. In morbidly obese young patients with OSA, factors directly related to OSA may also be contributing to the development of hypertension. With increasing age, other competitive risks may obscure any independent effect that OSA may exert. 
1	Intraepithelial anchoring fibril components. Cultured human keratinocytes and cultured human cervical carcinoma cells (ME-180) contained intracellular pools of antigens that reacted with the anchoring fibril antibodies AF1 and AF2. In keratinocytes, these antigens formed a basement membrane-like structure near the apical portions of the cells. Using flow cytometric techniques, pretreatment of the ME-180 cells with acetone revealed large intracellular pools of antigen. The intracellular epitope was calcium sensitive. Some forms of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa have retention of intracellular portions of the anchoring fibril suggesting a relation of the intracellular anchoring fibril antigens to that disease. 
5	Arthroscopic treatment of temporomandibular joint locking resulting from disc derangement: two-year results. This article reports 2-year postarthroscopic surgical treatment data for 18 subjects (17 female and 1 male) who had a diagnosis of restricted mandibular movement due to an internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). These subjects had been treated by an average of 2.1 +/- 1.1 doctors for their TMJ problem before seeing the surgeon for arthroscopic treatment. The subjects' mean pain score at the final time point (21 to 30 months after surgery) was decreased by 57% in usual pain intensity. Jaw function showed an average improvement of 67%. These subjects also showed a 13-mm mean increase in their maximum active opening ability at the 2-year postsurgical time point. Slight to definite clicking noises were present presurgically in 11 of 18 patients, and similar joint noises were reported in 14 of 18 patients postsurgically. The mean overall improvement was rated as 8.18 +/- 2.4, with 10 the highest possible rating. One subject rated her improvement as 0, two subjects rated their improvement as 6 out of 10. No significant morbidity was reported by the subjects as a result of their surgery. 
4	Endothelium-derived relaxing factors. A perspective from in vivo data. We review below published studies of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in vivo. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation has been demonstrated in conduit arteries in vivo and in the cerebral, coronary, mesenteric, and femoral vascular beds as well as in the microcirculation of the brain and the microcirculation of cremaster muscle. The available evidence, although not complete, strongly suggests that the endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by acetylcholine in the cerebral microcirculation is a nitrosothiol. The endothelium-derived relaxing factor generated by bradykinin in this vascular bed is an oxygen radical generated in association with enhanced arachidonate metabolism via cyclooxygenase. In the microcirculation of skeletal muscle, on the other hand, the vasodilation from bradykinin is mediated partly by prostacyclin and partly by an endothelium-derived relaxing factor similar to that generated by acetylcholine. Basal secretion of endothelium-derived relaxing factor is controversial in vivo but is usually present in vitro. On the other hand, it appears that endothelium-derived relaxing factor mediates flow-dependent vasodilation in both large vessels and in the microcirculation in vivo. The generation and release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor from endothelium may be abnormal in a variety of conditions including acute and chronic hypertension, atherosclerosis, and ischemia followed by reperfusion. Several mechanisms for these abnormalities have been identified. These include inability to generate endothelium-derived relaxing factor or destruction of endothelium-derived relaxing factor by oxidants after its release in the extracellular space. These abnormalities in endothelium-dependent relaxation may contribute to the vascular abnormalities in these conditions. 
1	Expression of P-glycoprotein in adult T-cell leukemia cells. We have examined the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) samples from 25 patients. Based on immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against P-gp, C219, 8 of 20 ATL patients were P-gp positive at the initial presentation. All 6 patients at the relapsed stage were P-gp positive, and refractory to chemotherapy. The expression of MDR1 mRNA in P-gp-positive ATL cells was increased at the relapsed stage of one patient. P-gp of this patient was photolabeled with [3H]azidopine and the labeling was inhibited with nimodipine, vinblastine and progesterone. These results suggest that P-gp expressed in ATL cells from patients at relapsed stage has the same binding site(s) for the drugs as that in multidrug resistant cells, and is correlated with the refractory nature of the cells to chemotherapy. 
4	Depression and recovery of right ventricular function after cardiopulmonary bypass. Transient left ventricular dysfunction is commonly described in association with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). We evaluated changes in right ventricular (RV) function after elective cardiac surgery in 24 patients with normal preoperative cardiac function. In all, irrespective of distribution of coronary artery disease or use of pharmacologic support, a transient depression of RV systolic function with respect to both preinduction and initial postoperative (Postop) values occurred 262 +/- 116 min post-CPB as represented by a decrease in RV stroke volume index (25.0 +/- 1.7 vs. 33.4 +/- 1.9 ml/m2 Postop) and RV ejection fraction (31.0 +/- 2.2 vs. 45.6 +/- 2.5% Postop), and an increase in RV end-systolic and end-diastolic volume indices. This depression responded readily to pharmacologic therapy within 2 h, resolved within 24 h, and had no adverse consequences in these otherwise healthy patients. Further studies are needed to identify the cause of this phenomenon and its importance in patients with preexisting cardiac dysfunction. 
3	Hypothalamic or central obesity is associated with an early rise in plasma insulin concentration. Insulin levels in a 7-year-old boy with hyperphagia and obesity following an episode of meningoencephalitis were studied sequentially during the course of progressive weight gain. High fasting insulin levels (1183 pmol/L) and strikingly high insulin release in response to glucose (7892 pmol/L) were found within weeks of the onset of the illness. The abnormality in insulin secretion occurred prior to the marked weight gain. Hyperinsulinemia was not accompanied by hypoglycemia. Early hyperinsulinemia may be a primary event in the development of hyperphagia and obesity following hypothalamic injury. 
1	Zollinger-Ellison syndrome: prospective assessment of abdominal US in the localization of gastrinomas. The ability of abdominal ultrasound (US) to help localize gastrinomas was prospectively studied in 79 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The results were assessed by means of laparotomy, autopsy, or percutaneous liver biopsy. For hepatic gastrinoma, US had a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 100%, with a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of 89%. US was slightly less sensitive for detecting gastrinoma in the liver than were computed tomography (CT) (66%) and selective angiography (78%). For detection of extrahepatic gastrinoma, US had a sensitivity of 30%, a specificity of 94%, a positive predictive value of 100%, and a negative predictive value of 25%. US enabled detection of tumor in eight cases not detected with CT and in four not detected with angiography. Specificity for extrahepatic gastrinoma was similar for all three modalities (89%-95%). CT and US were equally effective for the detection of extrahepatic gastrinoma, and angiography was significantly more effective than both US and CT (P less than .01). The authors conclude that US, although of low sensitivity, remains useful as the initial imaging modality in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. 
1	Urogenital dysfunction after abdominoperineal resection for carcinoma of the rectum. The long-term urogenital dysfunctions in 46 of 104 surviving patients submitted to abdominoperineal resection for rectal carcinoma between 1972 and 1986 were collected and assessed. Urinary retention was present in 41 percent of the men and 35 percent of women, while incontinence was present in 10 percent of men and 29 percent of women. Impotence was reported by 59 percent of the males, all sexually active before surgery. Dyspareunia was present in 50 percent of the women in the study. The possibility of treating prostatic hypertrophy concurrently with abdominoperineal resection in selected cases to avoid urinary retention is discussed. The limited number of responders to the survey may interfere with the global statistical significance. 
2	Peritoneal mesothelioma: an unusual cause of esophageal achalasia. Secondary esophageal achalasia due to malignancy is a rare condition; only 53 such cases have been reported to date. Sixty-two percent of the cases were due to gastric adenocarcinoma. Mesothelioma of the peritoneum is an uncommon neoplasm. The usual presenting symptoms are abdominal pain, abdominal mass, or abdominal distention. The patient we are reporting had peritoneal mesothelioma which presented with dysphagia and weight loss, in addition to the radiological and manometric picture of achalasia. Secondary achalasia was suspected clinically, and was confirmed by computed tomography and laparotomy. The diagnosis of peritoneal mesothelioma was made only by histopathological examination. We are not aware of any other report documenting the association of peritoneal mesothelioma and achalasia. 
5	Intermittent vs maintenance medication in schizophrenia. Two-year results. This is a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 101 patients, evaluating the relative efficacy of intermittent medication (given only when the patient shows early signs of relapse) compared with moderate doses of maintenance medication for stable schizophrenic outpatients. Patients were dropped from the study if they had three prodromal episodes in 1 year or if an episode lasted more than 9 weeks. Fourteen percent of patients given maintenance treatment were dropped from the study compared with 46% of intermittently treated patients. Relapse rates were 16% for patients given maintenance treatment and 30% for intermittently treated patients, a nonsignificant difference. Intermittently treated patients were receiving significantly less medication, but there were no differences found in drug side effects. There appears to be no advantage in using the intermittent approach, but we found that the use of an early intervention strategy reduced the relapse and rehospitalization rates for these patients. 
5	Effects of acute ethanol ingestion and burn injury on serum immunoglobulin. Previous studies have found that acute ethanol ingestion before burn injury caused further impairment of mitogenic response of B lymphocytes compared with burn injury alone. The principal role of B lymphocytes is immunoglobulin production. This study was designed to determine the effect of acute ethanol ingestion on circulating immunoglobulin levels before injury. Serum concentrations of IgG, IgM, and IgA in rats were measured with the use of radial immunodiffusion plates at 4 days after a 30% burn injury in animals that had received a single ingestion of 3.0 ml ethanol per kilogram of body weight. The immunoglobulin levels were compared with appropriate controls. A 30% burn injury produced significant decreases in serum IgG and IgA levels but not in IgM levels, whereas acute ethanol ingestion only decreased IgA levels. Acute ethanol ingestion before injury did not induce any further significant decrease than did burn injury alone. 
1	Reconstructive and rehabilitative aspects of head and neck cancer in the elderly. Age should not be considered a contraindication to adequate head and neck oncologic surgery. Reconstructive efforts should be by the most direct means to attain restoration of form and function in one stage. The next significant breakthroughs in the battle against cancer may well come on the cellular or molecular level. We endorse the plea of Endicott for increased education and research directed at the problem of head and neck cancer and rehabilitation as they relate to the geriatric patient. 
3	Neurological sequelae of cerebral malaria in children. Out of 604 Gambian children admitted with falciparum malaria to one hospital between September and December, 1988, 308 had cerebral malaria and 203 were severely anaemic (haemoglobin less than 60 g/l). 14% of those with cerebral malaria died, as did 7.8% of those with severe anaemia. 32 (12%) of children surviving cerebral malaria had residual neurological deficit. 69 other children were admitted with clinical features strongly suggestive of cerebral malaria but with negative blood films; 16 of these died and 3 had residual neurological deficits. The commonest sequelae of cerebral malaria were hemiplegia (23 cases), cortical blindness (11), aphasia (9), and ataxia (6). Factors predisposing to sequelae included prolonged coma, protracted convulsions, severe anaemia, and a biphasic clinical course characterised by recovery of consciousness followed by recurrent convulsions and coma. At follow up 1-6 months later over half these children had made a full recovery, but a quarter were left with a major residual neurological deficit. Cerebral malaria in childhood may be an important cause of neurological handicap in the tropics. 
2	Prostaglandin E2-induced diarrhea in mice: importance of colonic secretion. The present study has investigated the basis for induction of diarrhea by prostaglandin (PG)E2 in mice. When given i.p., PGE2 induced a dose- and time-dependent diarrhea; the shortest post-treatment time for diarrhea onset was approximately 7 min, at a PGE2 dose of 200 micrograms/kg. At this dose, PGE2 also produced accumulation of fluid in the small intestine and in the colon (enteropooling). The enteropooling reached its maximum by 9 min and did not decrease until approximately 11 min (i.e., 2 to 4 min after the mean time for diarrhea onset). PGE2 treatment altered neither gastric emptying nor gastrointestinal propulsion, but strongly enhanced the expulsion of a glass bead from the colon (i.e., decreased the time to bead expulsion). The shortest time to expulsion of the glass bead was observed at 200 micrograms/kg i.p. The induction of diarrhea by PGE2 was unaffected by cecectomy, or sham-cecectomy, but the dose-response curve for time to onset of diarrhea by i.p. PGE2 was displaced to the right in animals with ligations of the ileo-ceco-colonic (ICC) junctions. The intraluminal fluid accumulation in the colon, evaluated in mice with ICC ligations, was increased by PGE2 administration within 2 min and remained greater than in vehicle-treated animals until the onset of diarrhea. The stimulation of colonic bead expulsion produced by i.p. PGE2 in control mice was not observed in animals with acute ICC ligations, even at i.p. doses up to 800 micrograms/kg. 
5	Posterolateral rotatory instability of the elbow. Recurrent posterolateral rotatory instability of the elbow is an apparently undescribed clinical condition that is difficult to diagnose. We treated five patients, ranging in age from five to forty years, who had such a lesion and in whom the instability could be demonstrated only by what we call the posterolateral rotatory-instability test. This test involves supination of the forearm and application of a valgus moment and an axial compression force to the elbow while it is flexed from full extension. The elbow is reduced in full extension and must be subluxated as it is flexed in order to obtain a positive test result (a sudden reduction of the subluxation). Flexion of more than about 40 degrees produces a sudden palpable and visible reduction of the radiohumeral joint. The elbow does not subluxate without provocation. The cause for this condition, we think, is laxity of the ulnar part of the lateral collateral ligament, which allows a transient rotatory subluxation of the ulnohumeral joint and a secondary dislocation of the radiohumeral joint. The annular ligament remains intact, so the radio-ulnar joint does not dislocate. Operative repair of the lax ulnar part of the lateral collateral ligament eliminated the posterolateral rotatory instability, as revealed intraoperatively in our five patients. 
4	Diagnosis of recent myocardial infarction with quantitative backscatter imaging: preliminary studies. Acute myocardial ischemia and chronic myocardial infarction may be recognized with ultrasound tissue characterization techniques because of myocardial acoustic changes caused by reduced perfusion and/or collagen deposition. Our purpose was to study the acoustic properties of recent myocardial infarction when the predominating pathologic finding was myocardial edema and leukocytic infiltration. We used a new quantitative backscatter imaging system to study 18 patients 9 +/- 5 days after myocardial infarction (eight patients with anteroseptal myocardial infarction and 10 with inferior myocardial infarction) and 20 normal subjects. The cyclic variation of relative integrated backscatter (end-diastolic minus end-systolic) was calculated from on-line measurements. Standard parasternal long- and short-axis and apical four- and two-chamber views were obtained. In the anteroseptal myocardial infarction group, the cyclic variation of relative integrated backscatter was lower in the septum (1.5 +/- 1.6 dB) than in the posteroinferior wall (3.2 +/- 1.2 dB); however, the sample size of only three patients (of eight patients imaged) in the latter group prevented statistical comparison. The cyclic variation of relative integrated backscatter in the infarcted septum was less than the measurement obtained in the septum of the control group (4.3 +/- 2.4 dB, p less than 0.05). In the inferior infarction group, the cyclic variation of integrated backscatter in the posteroinferior wall (1.8 +/- 1.7 dB) was not significantly different from the measurement obtained in the septum (3.7 +/- 3.6 dB); however, the cyclic variation in the posteroinferior wall was significantly less than that obtained in the control group posteroinferior wall (5.7 +/- 1.7 dB, p less than 0.05). 
1	Immunohistochemical demonstration of pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor in normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa. Specimens of normal and neoplastic colonic mucosa from 52 patients were analysed by immunohistochemistry using a monospecific polyclonal antiserum against human pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor (PSTI). In normal colonic mucosa PSTI was found in the goblet cells in the basal parts of the crypts. In adenomas of tubular, villous, and tubulo-villous types PSTI was also found in the upper parts of the polyps, usually occurring in the regeneration zone. There was a more intense staining reaction in polyps with increased atypia. Carcinomas of different types and of various grades of differentiation and of in situ type did not contain PSTI. These findings indicate that PSTI could be a marker for adenomatous rather than carcinomatous epithelium in the colon. Furthermore, the absence of the inhibitor in malignant cells might facilitate tissue invasion by malignant cells because of deficient protease inhibition. 
3	Spasticity in spinal cord injured persons: quantitative effects of baclofen and placebo treatments. Spasticity commonly occurs after a spinal cord injury and is characterized by increased resistance to passive movement of peripheral joints. This study examined the effect of an antispasticity medication on stiffness from the myotatic reflex response generated by passive sinusoidal ankle motion. A repeated measures, multiple base-line, single-subject, double-blind design was employed. The independent variable was spasticity medication treatment, where the levels were 40 mg/day and 80 mg/day of baclofen v placebo treatment. Viscous and elastic stiffness measurements were taken at the ankle joint during a placebo base-line phase and during treatment with baclofen for five adult males with traumatic spinal cord injuries. Ankle sinusoidal oscillation frequencies were from 3 to 12 Hz during test sessions. Mean viscous and elastic stiffness scores for all frequencies were calculated for each phase of the study. Randomization tests of mean changes in stiffness measurements between each treatment phase of the study failed to provide any convincing evidence of a significant treatment effect for reduction of spasticity in the traumatic spinal cord injured subjects studied. Further testing is needed to exclude potential confounding factors before this conclusion can be confirmed. The results suggest that baclofen is not a universal treatment of choice for all individuals with spasticity resulting from traumatic spinal cord injury. 
4	Left main percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with the autoperfusion catheter in an animal model. Left main coronary angioplasty is associated with high risk because of interruption of blood flow to much of the left ventricle during balloon inflation. An "autoperfusion" balloon angioplasty catheter that allows blood to flow passively distal to an inflated balloon was tested in dogs and compared with inflations with standard balloon catheters. During 3 min occlusions of the left main coronary artery with the autoperfusion catheter, regional myocardial blood flow was preserved at 0.60 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g, compared with 0.07 +/- 0.03 ml/min/g during inflation with standard balloon catheters (P less than 0.01). Similarly, at the end of 3 min of inflation, left ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dt were maintained with autoperfusion catheter inflation, but they were severely depressed after standard angioplasty balloon inflation. All seven dogs survived autoperfusion balloon inflation, whereas five of seven developed sustained ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation during or after standard balloon inflation. Thus, distal blood flow, hemodynamics, and survival were preserved during autoperfusion balloon inflation in the left main coronary artery. 
3	Prognosis of Wilsonian chronic active hepatitis. Twenty of 320 patients with Wilson's disease initially presented with chemical and laboratory features of chronic active hepatitis, confirmed histologically in 17. When first seen, cirrhosis was present in all 20 and was complicated by ascites and/or jaundice in 11. Within 1 week to 8 years of the onset of over liver disease the diagnosis of Wilson's disease was established, and treatment with D-penicillamine was promptly initiated in 19 patients. One man refused treatment and died 4 months later. Treated patients received D-penicillamine or trientine for a total of 264 patient-years (median, 14 patient-years). Abnormal water retention, for which salt restriction and diuretics were added to penicillamine or trientine, disappeared in all but 1 of the patients so affected. Symptomatic improvement and virtually normal levels of serum albumin, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase followed within 1 year in the majority of subjects. One woman died after 9 months of treatment. Two patients, who became noncompliant with the therapeutic regimen after 9 and 17 years of successful pharmacological treatment, required liver transplants. These results indicate that the prognosis of specifically treated Wilsonian chronic active hepatitis is very good in spite of the presence of cirrhosis. 
1	Head and neck cancer and ageing: a retrospective study in 438 patients. To evaluate whether age over 70 years represents a prognostic factor in head and neck cancer, we reviewed all cases observed between 1981 and 1984. Four hundred and thirty-eight (438) patients were considered in relation to three age groups (less than or equal to 59, 60-69, and greater than or equal to 70 years, defined as non-elderly, mid-elderly and elderly respectively). The main parameters analyzed included histological diagnosis (no difference emerged among the three age groups); anatomical site (hypopharyngeal carcinoma was most frequent in non-elderly patients); TNM stage (an higher incidence of early stages was seen in the elderly); performance status (better in the non-elderly); previous illnesses (life-style related diseases were more frequent in the non-elderly); contraindications to surgery (more frequent in the elderly); surgical treatment ('en bloc' resections were more often employed in the non-elderly); post-operative complications and local control (no difference between the three groups); multiple primary malignancies (head and neck, oesophagus and lung were more frequent in non-elderly patients) and survival (no difference). Although age affects several features of head and neck cancer patients, it does not appear from the present study to be an independent prognostic factor for local control and survival. With regard to survival, stage appeared to be the most important prognostic factor. 
5	Hereditary internal anal sphincter myopathy causing proctalgia fugax and constipation. A newly identified condition. A newly identified myopathy of the internal anal sphincter is described. In the affected family, at least one member from each of five generations had severe proctalgia fugax; onset was usually in the third to fifth decades of life. Three members of the family have been studied in detail. Each had severe pain intermittently during the day and hourly during the night. Constipation was an associated symptom, in particular difficulty with rectal evacuation. Clinically the internal anal sphincter was thickened and of decreased compliance. The maximum anal canal pressure was usually increased with marked ultraslow wave activity. Anal endosonography confirmed a grossly thickened internal anal sphincter. Two patients were treated by internal anal sphincter strip myectomy; one showed marked improvement and one was relieved of the constipation but had only slight improvement of the pain. The hypertrophied muscle in two of the patients showed unique myopathic changes, consisting of vacuolar changes with periodic acid-Schiff-positive polyglycosan bodies in the smooth muscle fibers and increased endomysial fibrosis. In vitro organ-bath studies showed insensitivity of the muscle to noradrenaline, isoprenaline, carbachol, dimethylpiperazinium, and electrical-field stimulation. Immunohistochemical studies for substance P, calcitonin gene-related peptide, galanin, neuropeptide Y, and vasoactive intestinal peptide showed staining in a similar distribution to that in control tissue. A specific autosomal-dominant inherited myopathy of the internal anal sphincter that causes anal pain and constipation has been identified and characterized. 
2	Glomerular binding and contractile response to angiotensin II in rats with chronic experimental cirrhosis of the liver. 1. The effects of angiotensin II on glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were studied in surgically instrumented conscious control and cirrhotic rats. In addition, angiotensin II binding and the contractile response to angiotensin II were studied in glomeruli isolated from cirrhotic and control rats. 2. Cirrhotic rats had a higher glomerular filtration rate and a higher renal plasma flow than control animals. A non-pressor dose of angiotensin II induced small but significant decreases in glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow in both control and cirrhotic rats, the effect on renal plasma flow being the most pronounced. 3. Plasma renin and aldosterone concentrations were similar in control and cirrhotic rats. 4. The cross-sectional area of glomeruli from cirrhotic rats was 42% greater than that of glomeruli from control animals. Angiotensin II (10(-9) mol/l) decreased the cross-sectional area of glomeruli from control animals by 6.4 +/- 0.9% and of glomeruli from cirrhotic rats by 6.6 +/- 0.8% (P = not significant for comparison between control and cirrhotic animals). 5. There were no differences between control and cirrhotic rats in the affinity of angiotensin II for its glomerular receptors. However, the angiotensin II receptor density was higher in cirrhotic than in control rats, thereby producing an increased total angiotensin II binding in cirrhotic rats. 6. Since no functional differences between control and cirrhotic animals were present in the response to angiotensin II, even though angiotensin II binding was increased, a post-receptor blockade of the angiotensin II signal could be present in cirrhotic rats. 
1	Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer: prognostic value of DNA ploidy and post-recurrent survival. Eighty-six patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent curative operations were postoperatively randomized to control and adjuvant chemotherapy groups. In the adjuvant chemotherapy group, patients received cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy 3 or 4 weeks after operation and the average cycle of chemotherapy was 2.3 (from 1 to 6 cycles). In this trial, no evidence of improved survival or delayed recurrence was seen in the treated patients. In multivariate analysis of prognostic variables, the most important factor was the pathological stage of the disease and, second, DNA ploidy of the primary tumor. Although histology (squamous vs. non-squamous cell carcinoma) had a trend to influence the survival, it was not a significant factor. A total of 33 patients had recurrences: 17 and 16 patients were in control and adjuvant chemotherapy groups, respectively. Postrecurrent survival in the adjuvant chemotherapy group was significantly shorter than that in the control group, as determined by the generalized Wilcoxon and log rank tests. Median survival time after recurrence in the control and adjuvant therapy groups was 18.5 and 7.5 months, respectively. These results suggest that DNA ploidy of primary tumors should be considered as a prognostic factor in future trials of adjuvant therapy. Furthermore, analysis of postrecurrent survival in the adjuvant chemotherapy trial, as well as that of overall and disease-free survivals should be done. 
4	Comparison of two doses of endotracheal epinephrine in a cardiac arrest model. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to measure plasma catecholamine levels and the cardiovascular response before and after endotracheal administration of epinephrine in a swine cardiac arrest model. DESIGN: Prospective, controlled laboratory investigation. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-one swine weighing 10 to 12 kg, anesthetized with ketamine and alpha-chloralose and ventilated with room air. INTERVENTIONS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced with 90 V of 60 Hz current delivered to the right ventricle by transvenous pacemaker. Blood samples for epinephrine were drawn before arrest and every two minutes thereafter. At five minutes, external mechanical cardiac compressions were initiated. Nine animals received no further therapy and served as controls. Two groups of six animals received either 0.01 mg/kg or 0.1 mg/kg of epinephrine through the endotracheal tube at ten and 20 minutes. Blood samples were assayed for epinephrine. MEASUREMENTS: Arterial blood pressure, lead II ECG, and plasma epinephrine. MAIN RESULTS: Swine receiving epinephrine 0.01 mg/kg had an increase in epinephrine levels after drug administration, but these were not significantly different from control levels. The 0.1-mg/kg dose group had a significant increase in plasma epinephrine levels compared with controls and the 0.01-mg/kg dose group after receiving epinephrine at ten and 20 minutes. These increases were from 14 +/- 3 to 215 +/- 40 ng/mL (+/- SEM) at 12 minutes after arrest and from 151 +/- 56 to 402 +/- 80 ng/mL at 22 minutes after arrest. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that standard dosing of epinephrine through the endotracheal tube during arrest does not produce significant increases in plasma catecholamines or blood pressure. Epinephrine 0.1 mg/kg produces a significant increase in plasma epinephrine levels, but it is not sufficient to produce a significant change in blood pressure. 
5	Association of Helicobacter pylori infection with dyspeptic symptoms in patients undergoing gastroduodenoscopy. PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori in patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and ulcer disease as well as in a control population undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for suspected pancreatic or biliary disease. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-six eligible patients undergoing upper endoscopy at Massachusetts General Hospital were studied over a period of 18 months, as well as 24 patients undergoing ERCP for presumed pancreatic or biliary disease. Two biopsy specimens from the fundus and two from the antrum were taken for microbiologic and histopathologic analysis. Sera were examined by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay. All specimens were processed in a blind fashion. Chi-square test with Yates' correction was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: H. pylori was found in 31 of 46 (67%) study patients and in six of 24 (25%) control patients (by microbiologic or histologic techniques) (p less than 0.01). H. pylori was found in all patients with peptic ulcer disease and in 60% of patients without ulcers. No association between H. pylori and any specific gastrointestinal symptom was observed. H. pylori was identified in the fundus as often as in the antrum, although in the antrum the organism was more often associated with histologic gastritis. Compared with histology, serologic assays for IgG and IgA antibodies to H. pylori had sensitivities of 100% and 94%, and specificities of 86% and 76%, respectively. Reexamination of selected specimens without knowledge of their identity revealed that the specificity of serology exceeded 94% while the sensitivity of histologic and microbiologic studies may have been closer to 80%. CONCLUSIONS: H. pylori was more common in dyspeptic patients than in our control subjects undergoing ERCP. Multiple biopsy sites from fundus and antrum are required to exclude infection. Serologies of IgG and IgA were sensitive and specific for H. pylori, suggesting a possible role for non-endoscopic diagnosis of this infection. The frequent association of H. pylori with active inflammation rather than with quiescent gastritis is consistent with a pathologic role of this organism. 
3	Entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of the ligament of Struthers. The presence of a supracondylar process and Struthers' ligament is a rare congenital anomaly that may cause compression of either the median nerve, the brachial artery, or both. The authors present a case in which the supracondylar process and Struthers' ligament compressed both the median nerve and the brachial artery. This case is unusual, in that the symptoms of compression of the brachial artery increased--namely, the pulse intensity decreased and the pain increased with elbow flexion. 
1	Progression of human papillomavirus type 18-immortalized human keratinocytes to a malignant phenotype. We have developed a model system for progression of human epithelial cells to malignancy, using a human papillomavirus type 18 (HPV-18)-immortalized human keratinocyte cell line. Cells of cell line FEP-1811 were nontumorigenic in athymic mice through at least 12 passages in culture, but after 32 passages were weakly tumorigenic, producing tumors that regressed. After 62 passages they produced invasive squamous cell carcinomas that grew progressively. The progression to malignancy was associated with an increase in the efficiency of forming colonies in soft agar and with altered differentiation properties. In an organotypic culture system, FEP-1811 cells at passages 12 and 32 exhibited features typical of premalignant intraepithelial neoplasia in vivo, and cells at passage 68 exhibited features consistent with squamous cell carcinomas. No change in copy number of the transfected HPV-18 genome or in the level of expression of the viral transforming gene products E6 and E7 was detected between tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells. Cytogenetic analysis of cells at early, middle, and late passage levels and cells cultured from tumors revealed that several chromosomal abnormalities segregated with the tumorigenic cell populations. 
5	Complications in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: relationships with patient age. Five hundred consecutive attempted lower limb angioplasties for ischaemic disease (370 patients, mean age 65.6 years, range 33-91 years) were reviewed. Significant complications occurred in 44 cases (8.8%). Nine patients (1.8%) underwent emergency surgery related to a complication. A further 12 patients (2.4%) underwent elective surgery related to a complication. In addition, four patients died within 30 days of the procedure; one following surgery performed because of a complication of angioplasty, one following a myocardial infarction, one following severe bleeding associated with subsequent thrombolytic therapy and one during emergency surgery related to a complication of angioplasty. A correlation was found between complication rate and age. This relationship was independent of the approach to, the position of, and the severity of the treated lesion. Elderly patients are at increased risk of complication in lower limb angioplasty. 
3	Clonotypic analysis of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies from experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis-sensitive Lewis rats and experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis-resistant Wistar Furth rats. A single immunization of Lewis rats with purified acetylcholine receptor (AChR) emulsified in adjuvant typically stimulates the production of oligoclonal AChR-reactive antibodies (as demonstrated by IEF) dominated by the IgG2a subclass, of moderate but clonotypically heterogeneous relative Ag-binding avidity, and capable of inducing symptoms of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis. Although similar immunization of Wistar Furth rats produces AChR-reactive antibodies with similar characteristics of clonotypic heterogeneity, avidity, and isotype expression, no detectable signs of AChR-dependent muscle impairment is observed. This contrasts the ability to induce impaired AChR function upon the passive transfer of pre-formed Lewis anti-AChR antibodies into naive Wistar Furth rats, suggesting that disease resistance in this model is not conferred at the level of the AChR itself. Moreover, if more aggressive immunization protocols are used (i.e., multiple injections of AChR), a transient breakthrough of AChR-dependent muscle dysfunction can be induced directly in the Wistar Furth strain indicating that the potential for the production of disease-causing antibodies does exist in the Wistar Furth repertoire. IEF analysis of Wistar Furth anti-AChR antibodies has revealed that hyperimmunization results in modified antibody clonotype expression that might explain changing expression of disease symptoms; however, explanations for the apparent "resistance" of Wistar Furth rats to disease induction are likely to be complex. 
1	Bilateral renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to thyroid. A case of bilateral synchronous renal cell carcinomas with metastases to the regional lymph nodes and later to the thyroid gland was treated with aggressive surgical extirpation and adjuvant gamma interferon. The patient continues to have an excellent performance status sixteen months after initial diagnosis despite a large tumor burden at presentation. 
4	Liver transplantation: MR angiography with surgical validation. Thirty patients (mean age, 45 years) were evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) angiography before liver transplantation to assess the accuracy of MR angiography. A series of breath-hold, two-dimensional images were acquired and subsequently processed to form three-dimensional projection angiograms. Graphic information on blood flow in the portal vein was acquired by using presaturation bolus tracking. Correlative duplex ultrasound (US) was performed in 28 patients, and surgical or autopsy correlation was available in all cases. MR angiography demonstrated patency of the portal vein in 26 (96%) of 27 patients, made possible the diagnosis of portal venous occlusion in three of three patients, depicted reversed portal flow in one patient, and provided clear delineation of the extent of varices and specific portosystemic collateral vessels. When duplex US was successful, there was full agreement with MR angiographic results in assessing portal vein patency and flow direction. All of the MR findings were corroborated at surgical exploration or autopsy. The authors conclude that MR angiography is very accurate in the portal system and is valuable in preoperative assessment for liver transplantation. 
2	Non-specific reactions in enzyme linked immunosorbent assays for serum antibody to entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia in non-endemic areas. Serum samples from 20 Indian children with diarrhoea were compared with those from 20 children resident in the United Kingdom who had been diagnosed as having ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease, or indeterminate colitis using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays specific for Entamoeba histolytica and Giardia lamblia. More than 50% of the United Kingdom patients had high IgG responses in ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia. A confirmatory ELISA showed that the British sera reacted specifically to bovine serum proteins rather than to protozoal antigens. Prior incubation of sera with 5% bovine serum prohibited this reaction. Bovine serum is an integral part of the crude soluble antigen used in most ELISAs for E histolytica and G lamblia and needs to be replaced with purified antigen preparations. The British sera also reacted to other commonly used blocking agents such as bovine serum albumin, casein, and normal sheep serum. These reactions were attributed to uptake of dietary antigens or an enhanced immunological response to these antigens in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. 
4	Subgroups of patients with atypical circadian patterns of symptom onset in acute myocardial infarction. Circadian variation of onset of acute myocardial infarction has been noted in many studies and may carry important implications. However, only a few previous studies have attempted subgroup analysis. In 4,796 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction, the time of symptom onset was recorded. As in other studies, a peak occurred in the morning hours from 6 A.M. to noon with 28% of the population (1.16 times the average percent for the other time periods) experiencing symptom onset in that period (p less than 0.001). There was a second lower peak (25%) in the evening hours between 6:01 P.M. and midnight, also observed in some previous studies. Whether the presence of subgroups with specific clinical characteristics would exhibit different patterns and thereby contribute to these peaks in the overall population was then determined. In patients with a history of congestive heart failure (n = 606) or with non-Q-wave infarction (n = 832), a pronounced peak (29%) occurred only in the evening hours. In patients greater than 70 years of age (n = 1,422), smokers (n = 2,057), diabetics (n = 767), women (n = 1,213) and patients taking beta blocking drugs (n = 847), 2 nearly equal peaks were observed. Finally, in patients with previous myocardial infarction (n = 1,104), no peaks were observed. In a subgroup of patients (n = 1,084) free from the most important modifying factors, there was a single very pronounced late morning peak (32%), 1.39 times the average percent for the other time periods (p less than 0.001), without evidence of a second evening peak. 
5	Excess deaths from nine chronic diseases in the United States, 1986 To assess excess mortality from chronic disease in the United States, state age-adjusted combined mortality rates for nine chronic diseases in 1986 were compared with three "minimum" rates--two calculated from rates actually achieved in states and a third estimated as the mortality remaining after elimination of one risk factor for each disease. Hawaii had the lowest mortality rate of combined diseases (305/100,000); state excesses ranged from 0% to 37%. The sum of lowest disease-specific rates in any state was 284 per 100,000, indicating excesses of between 7% and 41%. A minimum mortality rate of 224 per 100,000 was estimated to result from elimination of one risk factor for each of the nine diseases, indicating state excesses from 26% to 54%, or 524,000 US deaths. Reduction of US mortality from the nine diseases to the risk factor--eliminated rate is estimated to be associated with an increased life expectancy at birth of 4 years. 
5	Mapping of herpes simplex virus-1 neurovirulence to gamma 134.5, a gene nonessential for growth in culture. The gene designated gamma 134.5 maps in the inverted repeats flanking the long unique sequence of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) DNA, and therefore it is present in two copies per genome. This gene is not essential for viral growth in cell culture. Four recombinant viruses were genetically engineered to test the function of this gene. These were (i) a virus from which both copies of the gene were deleted, (ii) a virus containing a stop codon in both copies of the gene, (iii) a virus containing after the first codon an insert encoding a 16-amino acid epitope known to react with a specific monoclonal antibody, and (iv) a virus in which the deleted sequences were restored. The viruses from which the gene was deleted or which carried stop codons were avirulent on intracerebral inoculation of mice. The virus with the gene tagged by the sequence encoding the epitope was moderately virulent, whereas the restored virus reacquired the phenotype of the parent virus. Significant amounts of virus were recovered only from brains of animals inoculated with virulent viruses. Inasmuch as the product of the gamma 134.5 gene extended the host range of the virus by enabling it to replicate and destroy brain cells, it is a viral neurovirulence factor. 
1	Influence of chromosomal integration on glucocorticoid-regulated transcription of growth-stimulating papillomavirus genes E6 and E7 in cervical carcinoma cells. In most cervical carcinoma cells the E6 and E7 genes of specific human papillomaviruses are transcribed from viral sequences integrated into host cell chromosomes. Glucocorticoids activate the promoter elements of various human papillomaviruses in transient-expression assays. We have analyzed the effect of dexamethasone on the transcription rate of human papillomavirus 18 E6 and E7 genes integrated at different chromosomal sites in four cervical cancer cell lines. Dexamethasone led to an increase in the transcription rate of the integrated E6-E7 sequences in C4-1 and C4-2 cells but led to a decrease in SW 756 cells and did not affect the transcription rate in HeLa cells. However, when the viral promoter elements derived from HeLa or SW 756 cells, in which dexamethasone does not activate transcription of the integrated E6-E7 sequences, were tested in transient-expression assays within the same cell lines, dexamethasone consistently activated the viral promoter. It thus appears that dominant regulatory mechanisms presumably depending on the chromosomal integration site are able to override the response of the viral promoter to steroid hormones. The growth rate of all dexamethasone-treated cell lines correlated consistently with the expression of the papillomavirus E6 and E7 genes, supporting their role in the maintenance of the proliferative phenotype of cervical carcinoma cells. Since human papillomaviruses are integrated into the host cell genome at variable, presumably randomly selected chromosomal loci, regulatory mechanisms that influence viral gene expression, and hence cell growth, may differ among cancers of independent clonal origin. 
1	Long-term effects of radiotherapy in childhood and adolescence. The records of 50 selected pediatric patients who were treated and followed at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center were reviewed to study the late effects of nonsurgical treatment of cancer in children. There were 26 girls and 24 boys ranging in age between 2 months and 16 years. Patients with head and neck cancer received chemotherapy and radiotherapy for rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 27), retinoblastoma (n = 8), or nasopharynx cancer (n = 2). Median follow-up was 13 years. The most severe side effects were noted in the fields of radiation and included hypoplasia of the jaw, orbit, or hemi-face with varying degrees of atrophy of the overlying soft tissues. A wide range of endocrine, dental, and psychologic abnormalities was also documented. Since 1 in every 1,000 adults older than 20 years today is likely to be a survivor of childhood cancer, recommendations are made for this "new" class of patients whom the head and neck surgeon will be seeing in the future. 
5	Amniotic and thromboembolism. Embolic phenomena in pregnancy demand rapid investigation and treatment. Regardless, some patients will not survive due to the enormity of the insult. Optimally, such patients should be treated in tertiary care centers, but this is not always possible. 
5	Urgent management of a giant scrotal hernia. An unusual case of giant scrotal hernia is presented. Hernias of this magnitude are extremely rare, even in underdeveloped countries, and their repair is challenging to the surgeon and stressful to the patient. Only a few case reports on the use of pneumoperitoneum prior to herniorrhaphy have been published; however, our patient's accompanying complications of diabetes mellitus and gastrointestinal symptoms precluded the use of pneumoperitoneum. The emergency management, including the expansion of the abdominal cavity with prosthesis, the ensuing postoperative complications, and the patient outcome, are discussed. 
2	The importance of intraoperative cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) using electrocoagulation was successfully performed in 56 out of 58 selected patients. Cholangiography was performed in 53 patients. Six patients had common duct stones; five were unsuspected preoperatively. After the gallbladder was removed, three patients underwent open common duct exploration. In another five cases, anatomical anomalies were discovered. Cholangiography performed via the cystic duct before any structures are divided can prevent the most serious complication--common duct injury. Cholangiography should be attempted on all patients undergoing LC. 
4	Excretion of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin metabolites before and after exercise testing in patients with and without signs of ischemic heart disease. We addressed the hypothesis that platelets are not activated in association with effort-induced myocardial ischemia in stable coronary disease. Seventy-two patients undergoing a diagnostic bicycle exercise test were stratified according to the development of chest pain (yes/no, 33/39) and of exercise-induced ST-segment depression of at least 200 microV in the electrocardiogram (yes/no, 12/60). Noninvasive indexes of platelet activation and of platelet/vessel wall interaction (urinary excretion of the 2,3-dinor-metabolites of thromboxane A2 [Tx-M] and prostacyclin [PGI-M], respectively) were analyzed in samples collected in the basal state and after the test. Basal Tx-M and PGI-M did not differ in patients with (236 +/- 35 and 131 +/- 22 pg/mg creatinine, respectively) and without (185 +/- 16 and 101 +/- 13 pg/mg creatinine, respectively) chest pain, or in those with (178 +/- 45 and 162 +/- 41 pg/mg, respectively) and without (216 +/- 22 and 104 +/- 11 pg/mg, respectively) ST-segment depression during the test. Patients without chest pain or without ST-segment depression moderately increased (p less than 0.05) their urinary Tx-M (by 21% and 13%, respectively) and PGI-M (by 28% and 23%, respectively) after exercise. No significant increases were observed in those developing chest pain or ST depression during exercise. These data indicate that effort-induced myocardial ischemia is not associated with an increase in platelet activation or platelet/vessel wall interaction in patients with stable coronary disease. 
2	Stasis syndromes following gastric surgery: clinical and motility features of 60 symptomatic patients. We retrospectively reviewed the records of 60 patients who had been referred for gastrointestinal manometry because of stasis after gastric surgery. Nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal pain, and weight loss were the most common symptoms. Two thirds of these patients had a well-documented history of peptic ulcer before their initial operations; in others, surgery was performed for other reasons, such as obesity (5%) or reflux esophagitis (8%). Twelve patients had undergone truncal vagotomy and a "drainage operation" and 48 had received a partial gastrectomy with a gastroenterostomy: Billroth I (n = 8), Billroth II (n = 11), Roux-en-Y (n = 29). All patients had recordings of gastrointestinal manometry; 16 also had a scintigraphic measurement of gastric emptying. Measurements were compared with data from healthy controls. Gastric manometry, which could be assessed only in the group with an intact antrum, was characterized by antral hypomotility (p less than 0.05). Gastric emptying studies showed rapid early emptying of liquids and delayed emptying of solids (both p less than 0.05). In the whole group, fasting jejunal motility was characterized by absence of phase II in 13, presence of bursts of phasic activity in 18, and abnormal propagation of phase III in 8. A significantly increased frequency of phase III of MMC was noted in the patients after Billroth II and Roux-en-Y operations. Postprandially, 19 patients failed to develop a "fed pattern.". 
4	An unusual venous anomaly of the placenta. The authors present an unusual vascular anomaly of the placenta. The placenta was very large, weighing 1,490 g. On the fetal surface, numerous dilated and tortuous vessels were observed on and under the chorionic membrane, of which three branches arose from a vein that was connected to the umbilical vein. One of them had a 5 x 2.5 cm aneurysmal dilatation, where three secondary branches arose. These venous channels were dilated and tortuous. The longest secondary branch was 133 cm in length and 1.2 cm in mean diameter and led into the placenta. Multiple, severely coiled or straight small branches arising from these vessels were also observed as vascular tangles. Some of these smaller vessels also led into the placenta. All abnormal vessels were veins. The umbilical cord was also normal except for a membranous insertion, and the placenta was unremarkable except for its large size. 
2	A complex ileovaginal fistula with associated obstructive uropathy in a patient with Crohn's disease: technical considerations and review of the literature. A high index of suspicion of an ileogenital fistula should be aroused by a patient with Crohn's disease, weight loss, malnutrition, and a persistent vaginal discharge. Preoperative gastrointestinal and genitourinary evaluation should be used in an attempt to localize the fistulous origin as well as concomitant fistulae. The principles of surgical therapy include preoperative ureteral catheters, resection of the diseased bowel and fistulous segment of bowel, and interposition of healthy tissue (ie, omentum) between the bowel anastomosis and the vaginal cuff. 
5	Effect of portasystemic shunts on subsequent transplantation of the liver. Portasystemic (PS) shunts have been regarded as a relative contraindication to hepatic transplantation (HT) because of the potential for increased technical difficulties during the transplant operation. We compared operative blood loss, morbidity and mortality in 27 patients with PS shunts and 147 patients with no shunts (NS) who underwent HT. The PS shunt group included 12 portocaval (PC), eight mesocaval, four central splenorenal and four distal splenorenal shunts. The PS shunt and NS groups were similar with respect to age, preoperative medical status and ABO blood group matching between donors and recipients. There were no significant differences in the mean (plus or minus S.D.) intraoperative blood transfusion (9.1 +/- 7.6 versus 9.2 +/- 11.0 units), mean (plus or minus S.D.) duration of anesthesia (8.1 +/- 1.4 versus 7.8 +/- 1.5 hours) and operative mortality (7 versus 11 per cent) between the PS shunt and NS groups, respectively. Complications of the biliary tract were significantly higher in the PS shunt group (22.0 versus 5.4 per cent, p less than 0.01) but they did not increase the mortality rate. We conclude that a prior PS shunt should not influence the decision to accept patients for HT. PS shunts remain a reasonable surgical option for patients with cirrhosis and variceal hemorrhage (refractory to sclerotherapy) who, by virtue of good hepatic function, do not merit immediate HT. 
3	Hemiplegia in posterior cerebral artery occlusion. We report 4 patients with hemiplegia due to a posterior cerebral artery occlusion. Associated clinical signs were aphasia, alexia or a neglect syndrome, hemianopia, and hemisensory loss. Hemiplegia was due to infarction in the lateral midbrain. The level of the occlusion in the posterior cerebral artery may be located distal to the junction with the posterior communicating artery. 
1	T-cell lymphoma and mature nephroblastoma after synchronous bilateral Wilms' tumor. A 15-year-old boy had lymphoblastic lymphoma of the left tonsil after being treated for bilateral Wilms' tumor (BWT) at 7 months of age. In addition, a fully differentiated Wilms' tumor was diagnosed in the remaining, partially nephrectomized left kidney. Development of second malignancies in patients with a history of BWT, as compared with those with unilateral Wilms' tumor, is discussed. A possible explanation for the concurrently diagnosed, fully differentiated Wilms' tumor in the remaining left kidney is suggested. 
4	Hypertension and the risk of dementia in the elderly. Vascular dementia is the second most common type of dementia in the elderly after the dementia of Alzheimer's disease. Six forms of vascular dementia have been described: multi-infarct dementia, lacunar dementia, Binswanger's subcortical encephalopathy, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, white-matter lesions associated with dementias, and single-infarct dementia. Each is described. Severe dementia is found in 5% of persons over age 65 and in 15% to 20% of persons over age 80 years. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 50% to 60% of cases of severe dementia and vascular dementia for 10% to 20%; 20% of the patients have both disorders. The incidence of vascular dementia, which seems to be declining, is about 7/1,000 persons/year. Hypertension is the most powerful risk factor for all vascular dementias. Vascular dementias can be accurately diagnosed by using clinical and mental state examinations, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, ischemic scores, and computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The most successful treatment of vascular dementia is the prevention of cerebral infarcts. Study of the incidence of vascular dementias and their treatment will be included in the European Trial on Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly (SYST-EUR) of 3,000 elderly hypertensive patients. 
4	Central nervous system vasculitis after chickenpox--cause or coincidence? A 7.5 year old boy, known to have a seizure disorder, presented with an infarct in the left middle cerebral artery territory, 10 weeks after severe chickenpox. Immunofluorescent antibody titre to the varicella zoster virus in the cerebrospinal fluid was 1:32. Cerebral angiography showed evidence of focal vasculitis. He presented again seven months later with an acute exacerbation of seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed an old posterior extension of the infarct, but a repeated angiography demonstrated an improvement in the vasculitic process. Cerebrospinal fluid antibody titre was again 1:32. Although this may have been an unfortunate coincidence, a possible association between chickenpox and vasculitis, similar to that reported with herpes zoster, and with potentially significant clinical implications, should be considered. As a definite proof can be obtained only by a brain biopsy, however, which is generally not indicated in such cases, only additional clinical reports can lead to delineation of this association as a definite entity. 
3	Sinus nodal dysfunction in young patients with long QT syndrome. Although sinus bradycardia and low heart rate with exercise have been found in some patients with long QT syndrome, systematic evaluation, including intracardiac electrophysiologic (EPS) tests of sinus node function, has not been reported. Records were reviewed of 14 children and adolescents (age 3 to 16 years) with long QT syndrome (mean QTc 0.51 second) who underwent noninvasive testing and intracardiac EPS because of syncope or cardiac arrest. The resting electrocardiographic (ECG) sinus heart rate was low for age in only 1 of 13 patients, while the lowest Holter-monitored sinus heart rate was abnormal in 4 of 12. The maximum exercise heart rate was abnormally low in 6 of the 12 who underwent exercise testing. For the EPS tests, the corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) was long in 8 of 14 and the sinoatrial conduction time (SACT) was long in six of the nine in whom it was calculable. When both noninvasive and EPS indices are considered, 13 of the 14 patients had some type of sinus node dysfunction. 
4	Significance of U wave polarity in patients with a prior inferior myocardial infarction. Sixty consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography and left ventriculography from six to eight weeks after the onset of definite inferior myocardial infarction were divided into three groups according to the polarity of U waves in (1) leads II, III, a VF and (2) in leads V4 to V6 (positive = Group P, flat or isoelectric = Group F, and negative = Group N). The following parameters were analyzed: (1) ECG score; (2) global ejection fraction: (3) regional area change: (4) number of asynergic, and akinetic segmental radii; (5) number of asynergic and akinetic areas: and (6) number of diseased coronary arteries and the incidence of left anterior descending artery (LAD) disease. There were no significant differences among the three groups according to the polarity of U waves in two subgroups by the site of U waves in age, gender, systemic blood pressure, and ECG scores. The polarity of U waves in leads II.III.a VF (subgroup 1) correlated with the size of myocardial infarction; regional area changes in inferior segment (Area 2) were 64.1 +/- 8.2 in group P1, 31.8 +/- 14.7 in group F1, and 21.0 +/- 15.8 in group N1 (p less than 0.01, F = 32.8). The polarity of U waves in leads V4-6 (subgroup2) correlated with anterolateral wall motion; regional area changes in anterolateral segments (Area 5) were 76.8 +/- 11.6 in group P, 66.5 +/- 18.5 in group F, and 48.9 +/- 17.1 in group N (p less than 0.01, F = 18.6). The incidence of multivessel disease increased from group P2 (36.4%), to group F2 (54.5%), to group N2 (75.0%), and the incidence of LAD disease increased from 27.3%, to 45.5%, to 68.8%, respectively. A negative U wave in either location suggested severely decreased apical wall motion, and there was a tendency for global ejection fractions to decrease in the following order: group P, group F, and group N. From these results, the authors conclude that the polarity of U waves may be one of the parameters correlating with the wall motion and left ventricular function in prior inferior myocardial infarction. 
5	Outcome of pregnancy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. A prospective study. A prospective study was performed to investigate the outcome and complications of pregnancy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Twenty-nine pregnancies occurred in 22 patients. There were 12 abortions, two spontaneous and 10 induced. Fifteen women had 17 live-born neonates. Neonatal complications included nine premature deliveries, two cases of intrauterine growth retardation, and one of Treacher Collins syndrome. Obstetric complications included threatened abortion (two), placenta previa (two), and preeclampsia (three). Cesarean sections were necessary in five patients. There was no maternal or neonatal mortality. Thirteen episodes of systemic lupus erythematosus relapses were detected by incidents of increasing proteinuria (six), arthritis (four), and vasculitic rash (two). There were no statistical differences in changes in hemoglobin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, albumin level, antinuclear antibody titer, or C3 or C4 level between the patients who relapsed and those who did not. Pregnancy could induce a flare of systemic lupus erythematosus in previously normal patients or patients with previously inactive disease. The overall neonatal and maternal survival was good, even in patients who presented during pregnancy. Spontaneous fetal loss was low (2/29 [6.9%]); both cases occurred in mothers with inactive lupus. 
5	The robustness of an empirically derived taxonomy of chronic pain patients. There is currently no classification system for chronic pain patients that has achieved consensus. The lack of a classification that is used consistently across settings has impaired advance of knowledge and treatment of chronic pain patients. Recently, an empirically derived multivariate classification system, the Multiaxial Assessment of Pain (MAP) patients, has been developed. In this paper, the generalizability of the MAP system was evaluated by contrasting the MAP classification of 3 common but diverse chronic pain syndromes, namely, low back pain, headache, and temporomandibular disorders. The results indicate that although the proportion of patients classified into the 3 subgroups of the MAP taxonomy differ, the profiles based on the pattern of interrelationship among the assessment scales were remarkably similar. These data suggest that the psychosocial and behavioral responses associated with chronic pain are common to diverse samples of pain patients despite differences in demographic characteristics and medical diagnosis. The implications of these results for research and clinical practice are discussed. The potential utility of a polydiagnostic approach using more traditional medically based classifications such as proposed by the IASP (Merskey, H., Pain, Suppl. 3 (1986) S1-S225) complemented by classification based on the MAP psychosocial-behaviorally based taxonomy are examined. 
5	IgG1-mediated acute pulmonary hypersensitivity response in the guinea pig. Involvement of specific lipid mediators. We determined the pulmonary obstructive response to aerosolized antigen challenge, and its sensitivity to antagonists of specific lipid mediators, in IgG, passively sensitized (IgG1-PS) guinea pigs. Antiovalbumin (OA)-IgG1 was isolated by affinity chromatography from serum derived from actively immunized Hartley guinea pigs. Propranolol and pyrilamine pretreated, IgG1-PS guinea pigs were challenged with aerosolized antigen and pulmonary obstruction was quantified by measurements of excised lung gas volume (ELGV). ELGV increased between 150 and 1,035% in a dose-proportional fashion with increasing antigen exposure (0.001 to 0.1% nebulizer concentration). The leukotriene antagonists ICI-204,219 and SKF-104,353 exhibited dose-proportional inhibitions in antigen-induced elevations in ELGV, inhibiting up to 65 and 87% at the maximal concentrations examined. Similarly, the platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonists WEB-2086 and L-659,989 inhibited antigen-induced elevations in ELGV, inhibiting up to 94 and 59% at the maximal concentrations examined. In contrast, the cyclooxygenase (CO) inhibitor piroxicam significantly enhanced (p less than 0.05) the OA-induced elevations in ELGV. Aerosolized PAF challenge produced dose-proportional elevations in ELGV that were significantly inhibited by the LTD, antagonist ICI-204,219 (38 and 43% inhibition) and the CO inhibitor piroxicam (62 and 48% inhibition) in sensitized and nonsensitized animals, respectively. We hypothesize that IgG1-dependent airway obstruction is mediated in part by LTD, produced in response to PAF generation. 
1	Endobronchial carcinoid and mucoepidermoid carcinoma in children. Endobronchial neoplastic disease is rarely encountered in patients under 20 years of age. The great majority of these lesions are carcinoids or mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Symptoms are secondary to bronchial irritation and manifest as recurrent pneumonitis, hemoptysis, persistent cough, reactive airway disease, and chest pain. Early bronchoscopy reliably enables identification and may prevent harmful sequelae resulting from delay in diagnosis. Retrospective data from four cases collected from the Tumor Registry in the Southern California Kaiser Permanente Medical Group is presented and a review of the literature is discussed. 
3	Long-term medical consequences of incest, rape, and molestation. One hundred thirty-one patients who gave a history of childhood sexual abuse were seen in a general medical practice decades after the event and were compared with a control group. The subject patients were found to be distinct for chronic depression, morbid obesity, marital instability, high utilization of medical care, and certain psychosomatic symptoms, particularly chronic gastrointestinal distress and recurrent headaches. It is clear that these remote events can underlie difficult chronic medical problems. Questions about childhood sexual abuse must become part of the practitioner's review of systems in these difficult cases, if not routinely. 
5	Early and frequent detection of HBxAg and/or anti-HBx in hepatitis B virus infection. To clarify the significance of the X gene of hepatitis B virus, we have tested for anti-HBx in the serum and HBxAg in the liver at different stages of the natural history of hepatitis B virus infection. Sera were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and positive results confirmed by immunoblot. Purified recombinant MS2 Pol-HBx fusion protein was used as target for both assays. Among serial sera of patients with nonfulminant acute hepatitis, 24 of 64 patients (37.5%) were positive for anti-HBx. In fulminant cases, 15 of 36 patients (42%) had anti-HBx. In chronic hepatitis patients with high rates of hepatitis B virus replication, we found a significantly (p less than 0.01) higher prevalence of anti-HBx, 14 of 25 patients (56%), than in those with low replication, 14 of 66 patients (21%), or among asymptomatic HBsAg carrier blood donors (20 of 126 = 16%) without detectable hepatitis B virus replication (p less than 0.0001). The highest prevalence of anti-HBx was found in HBsAg carriers with cirrhosis (41 of 54 patients = 76%) and/or with hepatocellular carcinoma (18 of 33 patients = 54%). The findings suggest that anti-HBx appears as a common and early marker of hepatitis B virus infection, transient in self-limited hepatitis but persisting with progression to chronicity. In chronic hepatitis, the prevalence of anti-HBx correlated with the intensity and duration of hepatitis B virus replication but neither with the severity of the liver disease nor with malignant transformation per se. 
5	Can nurses perform surgical cricothyrotomy with acceptable success and complication rates? STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to determine whether flight nurses can perform surgical cricothyrotomies with acceptable success and complication rates. METHODS: This case series examined the survival, success, and complication rates of surgical cricothyrotomy. A specially trained flight nurse retrospectively reviewed all prehospital, emergency department, inpatient, autopsy, and outpatient follow-up records. RESULTS: Fifty-five consecutive patients in whom surgical cricothyrotomy was attempted by a flight nurse during a two-and-one-half-year period were studied. Patients ranged in age from 9 to 76 years. The airway was not cannulated successfully by a flight nurse in two patients. In two patients, the tube was not in the cricothyroid space (one in the upper tracheal rings, and the other in the larynx). In three patients, packing was insufficient to stop bleeding from around the operative site; and in three the tube became occluded by blood in the emergency department. Finally, two patients developed subglottic stenosis. CONCLUSION: Surgical cricothyrotomy in the field can be performed reliably by specially trained nurses. Because only the most critically ill or injured patients with unmanageable airways are subjected to this procedure, a significant complication rate can be anticipated. 
4	Standards for evaluating results of interventional therapy for peripheral vascular disease. Uniform standards for evaluating and reporting the results of therapeutic interventions for peripheral vascular disease are clearly needed. They are already established for vascular surgery, as represented by several reports by SVS/ISCVS committees, but they are not always followed by vascular surgeons and have been largely ignored by other vascular interventionists. In this article, the major problematic reporting practices are discussed and illustrated, and 14 recommendations are advanced to deal with them. They are intended to provide precise definitions, objective criteria of success or failure, standardized severity gradation schemes for peripheral vascular disease and its risk factors, and proper procedures for reporting the outcome of all forms of therapeutic intervention. Until these or some other agreed upon reporting standards are accepted and followed, the literature on peripheral vascular disease and its management will continue to be a source of confusion rather than enlightenment. 
4	Clinical experience with doxazosin in general medical practice in The Netherlands. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and toleration of once-daily doxazosin in the treatment of essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure 95 to 115 mm Hg) in a general medical practice. Fifty-three patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension entered a study of 14 weeks' duration. This consisted of a baseline run-in period of 2 weeks, a dose-adjustment phase with doxazosin (8 weeks), and a maintenance phase of 4 weeks. Doxazosin was initiated at 1 mg/day, and every 2 weeks the dose was doubled unless blood pressure was normalized (sitting diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 90 mm Hg with greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg reduction from baseline) or significant side effects emerged. The maximum daily dose administered was 8 mg. Doxazosin produced a significant (p less than 0.05) final mean change in sitting blood pressure of -17.4/-12.2 mm Hg at a final mean daily dose of 4.1 mg. Heart rate was not significantly altered. A nonsignificant decrease in total cholesterol concentration (-2.66%, p = 0.06) and triglycerides (-8.80%, p = 0.09) was also observed. The effect of doxazosin on blood pressure and serum cholesterol resulted in a significant (p less than 0.001) reduction of 19% in calculated risk of coronary heart disease. The investigators' assessment of patient toleration of doxazosin was excellent or good in 86.8% of patients. 
5	Ventricular ectopy: significance and management. Ventricular ectopy is a normal variant of cardiac rhythm, and its significance in an individual is related to cardiac risk factors and the presence or absence of heart disease. Although there is good evidence in many forms of heart disease that complex VEBs indicate a high risk of death, treatment of asymptomatic VEBs with antiarrhythmic drugs has not been shown to improve survival and may be hazardous. Treatment should be directed at the underlying heart disease. Those with heart disease and severe symptoms resulting from VEBs will often require electrophysiological assessment as to specific antiarrhythmic therapy. Those without heart disease can usually be managed by reassurance and do not require antiarrhythmic drugs. 
5	A retroviral promoter is sufficient to convert proto-src to a transforming gene that is distinct from the src gene of Rous sarcoma virus. The src genes of four natural isolates of avian sarcoma viruses differ from cellular proto-src in two genetic substitutions: the promoter of the cellular gene is replaced by a retroviral counterpart, and at least six codons from the 3' terminus are replaced by retroviral or heterologous cell-derived elements. Since virus constructs with a complete proto-src coding region failed to transform avian cells but acquired transforming function by point mutations of various codons, it has been proposed that point mutation is sufficient to convert proto-src to a transforming gene. However, promoter substitution is sufficient to convert two other proto-onc genes, proto-ras and proto-myc, to retroviral transforming genes. In view of this, we have reexamined whether promoter substitution, point mutation, or both are necessary to convert proto-src into a retroviral transforming gene. It was found that a recombinant virus (RpSV), in which the src gene of Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) was replaced by the complete coding region of proto-src, transformed quail and chicken embryo cells. The oncogene of RpSV differs from the src gene of RSV in three genetic properties: (i) it is weaker--e.g., transformed cells are flatter; (ii) it is slower--e.g., focus formation takes 9 to 12 days compared to 4 days for RSV; and (iii) its host range is narrower than that of RSV--e.g., only subsets of heterogeneous embryo cells are transformed by RpSV even after weeks or months. Replacement of the proto-src 3' terminus of RpSV by that of src from RSV generates a recombinant virus (RpvSV) that equals RSV in transforming function. It is concluded that a retroviral promoter, naturally substituted via illegitimate recombination with retroviruses, is sufficient to convert at least three proto-onc genes, src, myc, and ras, to retroviral transforming genes. 
3	Internal fixation of femoral neck fractures. Two methods compared. In a prospective randomised study, the Hansson pin technique for internal fixation of fractures of the femoral neck was compared with the Uppsala screw technique. The series consisted of 115 consecutive patients, 97 women and 18 men, with a mean age of 80 years. There were 56 patients treated with Hansson pins and 59 with Uppsala screws. After one year 22 patients had died, eight in the Hansson pin group and 14 in the Uppsala screw group (p = 0.28). Twenty-four complications had occurred, 18 in the Hansson pin group and six in the Uppsala screw group (p = 0.008). After exclusion of those with complications, the patients in the Hansson pin group had significantly more pain, less mobility, and a smaller proportion were living in their own homes. 
5	Recombination between two 14-bp homologous sequences as the mechanism for gene deletion in factor IX Seattle 1. Factor IXSeattle 1 is a 10-kb intragenic deletion identified in a family that has hemophilia B. By sequencing across the site of the deletion, we discovered at the deletion junction a 13-bp sequence (5' . . . TAGAA-GTTCACTT . . . 3') that was homologous to two 14-bp sequences 10 kb apart in introns D and F of the normal factor IX gene. The presence of these homologous sequences in two different regions of the normal gene allows us to propose that genetic recombination has occurred between the sequences, resulting in the gene deletion. The precise recombination site was able to be localized to one of 5 bp (5' . . . AGTTC . . . 3') in the middle of the homologous sequences. The exact length of the deletion is 10,000 bp. 
1	The role of elective lymph node dissection in the management of patients with thick cutaneous melanoma. A retrospective search of patients seen at the Duke Melanoma Clinic from 1970 to 1986 identified 308 clinically Stage I patients, with 4.0 to 10.0 mm cutaneous melanomas. Five-year and ten-year survival was 56% and 43%, respectively. Elective lymph node dissection (ELND) was done in 116 patients (37.7%); there was no difference in disease-free interval (DFI) or survival between these patients versus patients treated with wide excision only (P = 0.9). Thirty-two patients (27.6%) had pathologically positive nodes on ELND. These patients had a shorter DFI (P = 0.05) and survival (P = 0.03) compared with patients with negative node dissections. When further divided by Breslow's thickness, this difference persisted in patients with 4.0 to 6.0 mm lesions (P = 0.01). However, for thicker lesions (greater than 6.0 mm), there was no difference in survival between the node-negative and node-positive groups (P = 0.9). The mean follow-up was 7.1 years. Elective lymph node dissection was not done in 192 patients; 78 of these recurred first in the regional nodes. These 78 patients were compared with the 32 patients who had pathologically positive nodes by ELND to see if patient survival was improved by early removal of nodal disease. There was no difference in DFI (P = 0.5) or survival (P = 0.3) between these two groups. It is concluded that ELND may provide prognostic information for patients with thick cutaneous melanomas. However, there was no change in DFI or ultimate survival when patients were followed, and nodes removed when clinically positive. The authors do not recommend ELND for patients with thick melanomas because the risk of distant metastases outweighs any benefit of regional node dissection. 
5	Prospective pharmacokinetically based development of effective infusion regimens for ACC-9358, a new antiarrhythmic drug. In this study we evaluated the clinical pharmacology of intravenous ACC-9358, a new antiarrhythmic drug derived from a Chinese herbal remedy. In a first-study phase, 0.125 to 1.0 mg/kg during 10 minutes was administered to six patients with chronic nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias. These data were then used to design 3-hour infusions to maintain stable plasma concentrations: these infusions suppressed arrhythmias by 90% or greater for 2 1/2 hours or more at plasma concentrations of 114 to 1010 ng/ml (mean, 400 +/- 421 ng/ml [SD]), and with QRS interval increases of 2.5% to 8.8% (5.1% +/- 2.9%). Mean clearance was 478 +/- 151 ml/min, and elimination half-life was 19.1 +/- 6.1 hours. ACC-9358 did not produce adverse effects in this study. ACC-9358 shows antiarrhythmic activity in humans at concentrations that prolong QRS only slightly and do not alter rate-corrected QT; further studies in other patient populations, at dosages and plasma concentrations defined here, are required to establish a clinical role for ACC-9358. The pharmacokinetically based dose-ranging approach allowed the safe initial evaluation of ACC-9358 in patients. 
1	Clinical application of ras gene mutation for diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Most pancreatic adenocarcinomas are known to have ras gene (oncogene) mutations. The site of the mutations is localized in codon 12 of K-ras gene. Such high incidence and localization of the ras gene mutations have not been observed in any other human malignancies. Polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing method enabled us to analyze DNA sequence around codon 12 of K-ras gene in small quantities of specimens obtained from needle biopsies and aspirate samples for pathological diagnosis. All the materials obtained from 12 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma showed the mutations, whereas those obtained from 6 patients with chronic pancreatitis showed no mutations. In several cases using the mutations of K-ras gene as a marker, this analysis supplemented conventional pathology and cytology in making the diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The analysis of ras-gene mutations was useful for the clinical diagnosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 
1	Acoustic schwannoma and epidermoid cyst occurring as a single cerebellopontine angle mass. The case of a 66-year-old man with a 3-year progressive hearing loss and a homogeneous left cerebellopontine angle mass on magnetic resonance imaging scan is described. At surgery, the major portion of the mass was a typical encapsulated, solid, acoustic schwannoma, but the most rostral portion was a distinct, flaky, cystic mass without a well-defined capsule, typical of an epidermoid cyst. The radiographic and operative findings of this unique coexistence of two different benign cerebellopontine angle masses are presented. 
5	Outcome of cataract surgery in central India: a longitudinal follow-up study. An epidemiological follow-up study of patients who had intracapsular cataract extraction in a voluntary hospital and its associated eye camps in Central India has for the first time evaluated the outcome one year after surgery in terms of visual acuity, use of spectacles, and improvement in income and mobility. The findings indicate that under these fairly typical conditions, 92% of the cases have adequate vision of 6/18 or better one year after surgery. Information on high usage of spectacles and on considerable improvements in income and mobility after cataract surgery is also reported. The outcome for patients operated upon in eye camps was almost as favourable as for those operated upon in hospital. Although the small differences are not statistically significant, the comparative findings require cautious interpretation and give rise to the epidemiological issues which are briefly discussed in this paper. 
3	MRI findings in neuro-Behcet's disease. We report MRI findings in 6 patients with Behcet's disease and CNS involvement. There were 3 different stages of imaging appearance: (1) During the acute illness, there were scattered areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images with predilection to the central structures of the cerebrum, the cerebral peduncles, and basis pontis. (2) During the recovery phase, most of these findings improved, but some white matter high signal areas persisted in the upper brainstem and peripheral subcortical white matter. Occasionally, findings were suggestive of microhematoma. (3) During the chronic phase, atrophy of posterior fossa structures became evident with decreased signal intensity suggestive of hemosiderin deposits. 
1	Hepatic giant cavernous hemangioma with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and consumption coagulopathy. We describe a case of hepatic giant cavernous hemangioma with both microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and consumption coagulopathy, but without thrombocytopenia, which was completely cured by surgical resection of the tumor. The patient was a 54-yr-old Japanese woman whose chief complaint was right upper abdominal discomfort. Angiography and dynamic computed tomography revealed typical findings of hepatic cavernous hemangioma. The patient also had hematological disorders. At surgery, we performed an atypical right lobectomy to preserve as much normal liver tissue as possible. The patient has been well, with no related complaints or abnormal laboratory findings, 5 yr since her operation. This case indicates that giant cavernous hemangioma of the liver should be considered in the differential diagnosis of MAHA, and if surgical treatment is adequate, hematological abnormalities may be eliminated. 
1	Characterization of preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in the rat pancreas. Nodules of acinar cells with increased proliferative potential develop in the pancreas of carcinogen-treated rats and in untreated aged rats. Large nodules are classed as adenomas. Phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of nodule cells were compared with normal pancreas and transplantable acinar cell carcinomas by several methods. Nuclei of acinar cells from normal pancreas, adenomas, and three carcinomas in situ had normal diploid DNA content as determined by flow cytometry. One of two primary carcinomas had a hypodiploid DNA content. Two of three transplantable carcinomas were aneuploid with a DNA content in the tetraploid range. Explants from nodules and adenomas failed to grow in soft agar, whereas several carcinomas were positive in this assay. A primary carcinoma was serially transplanted, but transplantation of nodules or adenomas failed. Transfection of DNA from carcinomas in situ yielded a higher frequency of NIH 3T3 transformants than DNA from adenomas. DNAs from the transformants did not contain ras sequences. These studies indicate that cells from nodules and adenomas have low growth potential and lack critical phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of transformed malignant cells that were present in some primary and transplanted carcinomas. 
5	Sympathomimetics for acute severe asthma: should only beta 2-selective agonists be used? Sympathomimetics have become a mainstay of the treatment of acute asthma. Aerosolization of sympathomimetics provides as great or greater bronchodilation in acute severe asthma with fewer systemic effects than parenteral therapy. Despite the broncho-selectivity achieved with this route of administration, cardiostimulation remains the major, dose-limiting factor in the safe use of sustained, high-dose therapy with these agents. This article reviews the pharmacology, adverse effects, and toxicities of selected beta agonists, as well as clinical studies relevant to the question posed in the title. Although the ideal study to answer this question has not yet been performed, the authors feel that available evidence supports the preferential use of selective beta 2 agonists in patients with acute, severe asthma who will require high doses of beta agonists. 
1	Cloning and expression of cDNAs for two distinct murine tumor necrosis factor receptors demonstrate one receptor is species specific. Complementary DNA clones encoding two distinct tumor necrosis factor receptors were isolated from a mouse macrophage cDNA library. The cDNA for murine tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1 (mTNF-R1) predicts a mature polypeptide of 425 amino acids that is 64% identical to its human counterpart, whereas the cDNA of murine tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2 (mTNF-R2) predicts a mature protein of 452 amino acids that is 62% identical to human tumor necrosis factor receptor type 2. The two murine tumor necrosis factor receptors have limited sequence homology (approximately 20% identity) in their extracellular regions but no apparent similarity in their cytoplasmic portions. Northern (RNA) analysis indicates a single 2.6-kilobase (kb) transcript for mTNF-R1; a 3.6-kb and a more predominant 4.5-kb transcript are observed for mTNF-R2. A human cell line transfected with either mTNF-R1 or mTNF-R2 expression vectors specifically bound 125I-labeled recombinant murine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha). Although mTNF-R1 had a similar affinity for both recombinant murine TNF-alpha and human TNF-alpha, mTNF-R2 showed strong specificity for recombinant murine TNF-alpha. This result suggests that the various activities of human tumor necrosis factor alpha reported in mice or in murine cell lines are probably mediated by mTNF-R1. 
5	Failure of internal fixation of displaced femoral neck fractures in rheumatoid patients. We reviewed the records and radiographs from 10 hospitals to identify 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had sustained 52 femoral neck fractures. Most patients were female (88%), elderly (mean age 66 years) and had had severe polyarticular disease for a mean duration of 16 years. Over half had taken systemic corticosteroids, nearly all were severely osteopenic but few had rheumatoid changes in the hip. Of the 20 fractures treated by internal fixation 12 had complications including nonunion (5), osteonecrosis (5), infection (1), and intertrochanteric fracture (1). Only one of the nine undisplaced fractures required reoperation, but seven of the 11 displaced fractures had revision surgery. Twenty fractures were treated by primary total hip arthroplasty with only one early complication. The other 12 fractures had been treated by hemiarthroplasty (9), hip excision (1) or non-operatively (2). Our results suggest that, in elderly rheumatoid patients, severely displaced femoral neck fractures should be treated by total hip replacement. 
4	Monitoring of spinal cord stimulation evoked potentials during thoracoabdominal aneurysm surgery. Repair of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm involves a significant risk of ischemic injury to the spinal cord. Standard monitoring of somatosensory evoked potentials, which relies upon peripheral nerve stimulation, becomes nonspecific and insensitive during this surgery when aortic cross-clamping produces lower extremity ischemia causing a peripheral conduction block. Techniques for the insertion of percutaneous epidural electrodes, developed originally for pain management, have been adapted to this setting to permit direct stimulation of the spinal cord for intraoperative monitoring of evoked potentials. The clinical outcome in patients monitored by this technique has been consistent with evoked potential findings. 
3	Ontogenetic features of audiogenic seizure susceptibility induced in immature rats by noise. Although numerous models are currently used for systematic study of the mechanisms of epileptogenesis in mature brain, few animal models have been developed that allow similar explorations in the developing nervous system. One experimental model of epilepsy supports a premise that perinatal experience can lead to eventual seizure susceptibility, however. Audiogenic seizure (AGS) susceptibility can be induced during a critical developmental period in normal mice by auditory deprivation and therefore by cochlear trauma. We studied the developmental parameters that affect success of both induction and testing of AGS-susceptibility in the rat. Intense high-frequency noise exposure was used as the traumatizing agent. The Wistar rat strain used is inherently seizure-resistant because in greater than 400 trials, untreated rats have never exhibited susceptibility at any age. Although single prolonged exposures to high-intensity noise were administered to groups of rats at ages between postnatal days (PNDs) 12 and 36, PND 14 was the age when exposure was most likely to result in eventual seizure susceptibility. Furthermore, duration of initial exposure on PND 14 determined the rate of susceptibility when measured 2 weeks later. Accordingly, we noted that single noise exposures at an intensity of 125 dB and ranging between 6 and 10 min in duration induced susceptibility in 100% of rats tested on PND 28; nonetheless, seizures among the rats exposed for 8 min were the most severe. Typically, these seizures began as wild running attacks and were followed by tonic/clonic convulsions. 
3	Oestrogen and progesterone receptors in acoustic neuroma. Tissue samples from fourteen consecutive (8 male: 6 female) acoustic neuromas were assayed for hormone receptors using either a monoclonal antibody (MA), dextran coated charcoal (DCC) or isoelectric focusing (IEF) technique. In this series there were no unequivocally positive results, a finding at variance with previously published results. 
5	Pneumococcal pneumonia in a rat model of cirrhosis: effects of cirrhosis on pulmonary defense mechanisms against Streptococcus pneumoniae. To study alterations in host defense mechanisms that enhance pneumococcal virulence, a model of Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia was developed in cirrhotic rats. Cirrhosis, with or without ascites, was produced in rats by intragastric administration of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). Histopathologic and laboratory studies demonstrated that CCl4-induced cirrhosis was similar to alcoholic cirrhosis in humans. Cirrhotic rats were more susceptible to type 3 pneumococcal pneumonia induced by intratracheal challenge than controls, and the presence of ascites was associated with the lowest LD50. More cirrhotic rats with ascites had bacteremia and elevated levels of circulating capsular antigen after challenge compared with cirrhotic rats without ascites or controls. Pulmonary clearance of pneumococci was markedly reduced in rats with cirrhosis and ascites and was associated with reduced serum complement levels. This model may be useful in further studies of the pathogenesis and therapy of pneumococcal infections in the compromised host. 
1	Changing cancer care in the 1990s and the cost. Progress in cancer research in the 1980s has led to predictions of a technologic explosion in the 1990s. Yet, with this progress there has been a groundswell of protest at the rapidly escalating costs of health care. More than $600 billion was spent on health care in 1989 and estimates of $1.5 trillion are made for the year 2000. Repeated attempts at cost containment have failed. It has been suggested that only by retarding technologic advances will we be able to control costs. Many observers believe that rationing of health care is the only solution, but new technology not only improves cancer care, it often decreases cost. It is not rational to retard advances that may later reduce costs, nor is it humane to retard advances that improve care, even if they cost more. In identifying priorities we should begin with the principle that treatments be restricted to clinical trials unless they have been demonstrated to prolong survival or improve the quality of life. If the payers reimburse procedures in an investigative setting, they will be on firm ground when they deny support for those same procedures outside an investigative setting. This is both an ethical and a fiscally responsible position for the third parties to take. It will not be easy for the profession or for the payers to deal with these problems. Public education and patient education will be key elements of any solution. Shifting the blame from politician to payer to professional will only make the problems worse. 
4	The cancer experience in the Framingham Heart Study cohort. The almost 40-year records of The Framingham Heart Study (FHS) cohort were reviewed to establish the cancer experience of this noninstitutionalized group of white subjects. Diagnoses were confirmed from pathology and laboratory reports and clinical notes. Age-specific incidence rates were compared with Connecticut Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data. Among the 5209 subjects, 1201 malignancies were confirmed. Median age at diagnosis was 69 for men and 65 for women. Lung, prostate, skin, and colon accounted for more than half of men's cancers; breast, colon, and skin made up half of the women's. FHS and Connecticut SEER rates matched closely, with the same primary tumor sites appearing commonly in both groups. Thus, the FHS cohort should provide a fair database for analysis of risk factors in cancer incidence, as it has done in cardiovascular diseases. 
5	Cartilaginous metaplasia of the epiglottis. Metaplastic elastic cartilaginous tissue has been described in the vocal cord, vestibular fold and ventricle of the larynx. This report documents a case in which cartilaginous metaplasia developed in the soft tissue of the epiglottis following an episode of epiglottitis. 
5	Simultaneous hepatoblastoma in identical male twins. Identical male twin infants who in 1987 presented with hepatoblastoma at the age of 7 months are reported. Twin B was admitted for investigation due to enlarged liver and spleen. He was found to have an inoperable hepatoblastoma of fetal type and was treated with chemotherapy and local irradiation. However, 7 months after the chemotherapy the tumor recurred. The asymptomatic twin A was examined because of the known familial cases, and he proved to have an identical tumor. He was successfully radically operated on and 2 years after the chemotherapy is still doing well with no evidence of tumor. As the mother and the maternal grandmother had polyps in the colon, quite probably the hepatoblastomas of the twins were associated with familial adenomatous polyposis. 
3	Brainstem auditory evoked response and subcortical abnormalities in autism. Previous studies of the neurobiology of autism that have used the brainstem auditory evoked response have given contradictory results. The authors of this study considered two supplementary aspects; they added an ipsilateral masking procedure, and they compared the results for every subject to the values (corrected for age and sex) of a large number of normal children. Twenty autistic (according to DSM-III-R criteria) and 13 mentally retarded (nonverbal IQ less than 75) subjects were assessed. Eighty percent of the autistic subjects had abnormal interpeak latencies, compared to 15% of the mentally retarded subjects. The I-V and III-V prolonged interpeak latency values were seen only in the autistic subjects. The ipsilateral masking procedure doubled the rate of detection of higher-brainstem abnormalities in the autistic children. 
5	Alcohol and gastrointestinal bleeding. Ethanol has experimentally been shown to be "ulcerogenic," independent of gastric intraluminal pH. Ethanol remains ulcerogenic despite antisecretory doses of H2-receptor antagonists. Low-dose alcohol stimulates acid secretion in man, an effect possibly mediated by histamine or gastrin. High-dose alcohol reduces intraluminal acid by damaging mucosa, thereby enhancing back diffusion of hydrogen ion, and also by direct damage to oxyntic (parietal) cells. Ethanol is capable of increasing gastric mucosal permeability as evidenced by the increase in back diffusion (increases intraluminal pH) and by the characteristic fall in transmucosal potential difference which reflects surface cell layer exfoliation. This exfoliation may offer an explanation for the potentiating effect of alcohol on gastric mucosal injury when it is ingested simultaneously with other gastric irritants. Ethanol of greater than 20% concentration can rapidly destroy the gastric mucus-bicarbonate layer, which may be a defense layer for both the inhibition of back diffusion and bicarbonate neutralization of existing acid. Ethanol depletes sulfhydryl compounds in gastric mucosa. These sulfhydryls may be necessary for stabilization of cell membranes as well as for binding free radicals. Ethanol is damaging to the mucosal microcirculation. The rapidity of ethanol-induced damage makes it unlikely that the process is purely ischemic. The cytoprotective phenomenon, as this brief literature review suggests, is a multifactorial, dynamic process. The complex interplay of mucosal defense factors, endogenous and exogenous stimuli, induction of humoral responses, and ultimately the success or failure of cellular repair, is unlikely to be solely mediated by endogenous prostaglandins. Although prostaglandins are unquestionably significant to cytoprotection, the supporting and, perhaps, major roles of leukotrienes, sulfhydryls, histamines, and like substances cannot be ignored. Several innovative therapeutic agents directly derived from these research efforts have already entered the clinician's formulary. The significance of the concept of cytoprotection is only now being realized in clinical applications. Alcoholic hemorrhagic gastritis, although a significant clinical entity, remains a rather elusive diagnosis for the emergency physician. As a diagnosis of suspicion, therapeutic trials of antacids, sucralfate, or perhaps synthetic prostaglandin analogues are acceptable, pending endoscopic verification or short-term resolution of symptoms. All patients presenting with true hemorrhage or with persistent symptoms should undergo gastroenterologic referral and endoscopic evaluation. The Mallory-Weiss syndrome has long been associated with acute and chronic alcohol abuse.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
1	Segmented turboFLASH: method for breath-hold MR imaging of the liver with flexible contrast. A method called segmented turboFLASH imaging allows high-resolution, multisection, short-inversion-time (TI) inversion-recovery (STIR), T1- or T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) studies of the liver to be completed within a breath-hold interval. The method was applied in a phantom and in 19 patients with hepatic lesions. Sequence comparisons were performed among segmented turboFLASH, single-shot turboFLASH, T1-weighted gradient-echo with ultrashort echo time, and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) techniques. Signal from fat and liver could be nulled with the segmented turboFLASH method, with TIs of 10 and 300 msec, respectively; signal from these tissues could not be eliminated with the single-shot approach. Signal-difference-to-noise ratios and contrast for the best segmented sequences were comparable with those of the best T2-weighted SE and T1-weighted gradient-echo techniques. It is concluded that it is feasible to obtain breath-hold images with arbitrary tissue contrast by means of segmented turboFLASH imaging. The method may prove helpful for the detection and characterization of hepatic lesions and will likely have applications to other anatomic regions such as the chest and pelvis. 
5	Trends in thirty years of vaginal hysterectomy. Vaginal hysterectomy, as currently performed at the University of Vienna, was first described by Halban in 1932. From 1955 to 1985, a total of 9,967 hysterectomies were performed. The vaginal route was used for 6,078 (60.9 per cent) of these procedures. Sixty-four per cent of the women operated upon were multiparous, 27 per cent were uniparous and 8 per cent were nulliparous. A comparison of the periods 1955 to 1975 and 1976 to 1985 revealed the following trends: the incidence of uterine myomas (30.6 to 27.1 per cent), in situ carcinoma of the cervix (6.5 to 7.9 per cent) and endometrial carcinoma (1.4 to 0.6 per cent) remained largely constant. In the past decade, indications for positional abnormalities (uterine descent and prolapse) were encountered more often (27.6 to 41.6 per cent) than in the first observation period, while the incidence of recurrent metrorrhagia was found to decline (33.9 to 22.8 per cent). The most common complications included hemorrhage during the operation, lesions of the bladder, hemorrhage until 48 hours after surgical treatment and hemorrhage from days 2 to 14 postoperatively (around 0.5 per cent, respectively). During the second observation period, no postoperative fistulas developed. Two instances of tubal prolapse were seen. Laparotomy was done in four of 6,078 instances. Two patients died of septic complications. Whenever possible, we prefer vaginal hysterectomy because of its low complication rate, low mortality rate and low postoperative morbidity. 
4	Etiology and pathophysiology of pyelonephritis. Escherichia coli is the most frequent cause of pyelonephritis. Its possible virulence factors include the ability to adhere and colonize the urinary tract, an important initiating factor in all urinary tract infections (UTIs). The importance of P fimbriae in this adhesion is stressed and the evidence for its importance in pyelonephritis is presented in epidemiologic studies of patients, as well as in animal studies. It appears that both host receptor density and the nonsecretor state is responsible for susceptibility to urinary tract infection. Vesicoureteral reflux can be responsible for ascending upper tract infection, but infection with P-fimbriated E coli may lead to ascending pyelonephritis without reflux because of the paralytic effect of lipid A on ureteral peristaltic activity. Renal ischemia leads to renal damage following infection by reperfusion damage due to the release of superoxide. Experimentally, this ischemic damage can be prevented by allopurinol, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor. The acute inflammatory response can produce renal damage because of the respiratory burst of phagocytosis, which while killing phagocytosed bacteria also damages renal tubules. An amelioration of the inflammatory response by treatment with superoxide dismutase or corticosteroids has been shown to modulate renal damage. Vaccination with P fimbriae has been shown experimentally to prevent the initiation of the disease. However, since vaccines are not clinically available, the clinical and animal studies on therapy of acute disease are stressed. Acute pyelonephritis during the first 3 years of life more often produced the renal damage that could lead to end-stage renal disease. 
5	Intestinal vascular sensitivity to vasopressin in portal hypertensive rats. The intestinal vascular responsiveness to arginine vasopressin was evaluated in rats with chronic portal hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were made portal hypertensive by stenosis of the portal vein. Ten to twelve days after the induction of chronic portal hypertension, the responsiveness of the small intestinal circulation to cumulative doses of vasopressin was evaluated using an isolated pump-perfused small intestinal preparation. The ED50 for maximal vasoconstriction was increased twofold in portal hypertensive rats compared with control rats. To determine if the impaired responsiveness to arginine vasopressin was related to the hyperglucagonemia of chronic portal hypertension, plasma glucagon levels were elevated in normal rats to levels previously measured in portal hypertensive rats (i.e. approximately 450 pg/mL), and the dose response studies were repeated. Glucagon significantly attenuated the responsiveness of the intestinal vasculature to vasopressin. Equipotent doses of nitroprusside also attenuated intestinal vascular responsiveness to vasopressin. The results indicate that there is a reduced vascular sensitivity to vasopressin in the intestine of portal hypertensive animals and suggest that elevations in circulating vasodilators in portal hypertensive conditions may partially explain this altered vascular responsiveness. 
4	Clinical evaluation of single versus multiple mammary artery bypass. The superior patency and clinical advantages of internal mammary artery (IMA) grafting are well established. However, the relative benefits of routine multiple IMA grafting remain uncertain. To determine whether routine multiple compared with single IMA utilization improved survival of patients undergoing coronary bypass procedures, 1,063 patients were prospectively allocated, beginning in 1984, to divergent management strategies of single (group 1, n = 420) versus multiple IMA grafting (group 2, n = 643). Subsequent analysis of anatomical extent of disease and preoperative baseline risk factors showed no differences (p = NS) between the two groups. All variables reflecting operative technique were similar (p = NS) for the two groups, except 74% of group 1 patients with multivessel disease received a single IMA graft, whereas 71% of group 2 patients with multivessel disease received multiple IMAs (p less than 0.05). By multivariate analysis, impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction, acute evolving myocardial infarction, advanced age, and unstable angina were incremental risk factors for mortality (all p less than 0.03), but group assignment (p = 0.4) and ultimate therapy were not (p = 0.6). Survival probabilities (expressed as 30-day group 1/group 2; 4-year group 1/group 2) were overall (0.97/0.98; 0.93/0.90), elective (0.98/0.99; 0.97/0.92), acute (0.95/0.97; 0.89/0.88), age of less than 65 years (0.98/0.99; 0.97/0.93), age of 65 years or older (0.93/0.97; 0.84/0.89), ejection fraction of 0.40 or more (0.97/0.99; 0.95/0.94), ejection fraction of less than 0.40 (0.95/0.96; 0.87/0.82), nondiabetic (0.98/0.98; 0.94/0.91), and diabetic (0.92/0.97; 0.88/0.87). No differences in survival were significant (p = NS). 
5	Oligoclonal T cell receptor gene rearrangements in blood lymphocytes of patients with acute Epstein-Barr virus-induced infectious mononucleosis. Gene rearrangement studies were performed on blood lymphocytes from eight patients with acute Epstein-Barr virus-induced infectious mononucleosis. The diagnosis in each case was based on characteristic clinical, hematologic, and serologic findings. The blood lymphocytes in each patient consisted predominantly of CD8+ T cells. EBV DNA was detected in seven patients by Southern blot analysis (EBV Bam HI W probe, Bam HI). A germline configuration was found for the immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes (JH probe, Bam HI and Eco RI; C kappa probe, Bam HI; and C lambda probe, Eco RI). T cell receptor gene rearrangements were detected with J gamma and J beta 1 + 2 probes. Using a J gamma probe with two different restriction enzymes (Bgl II and Eco RI), the blood from each patient showed several bands corresponding to the polyclonal pattern previously described in the blood of normal individuals. Using J beta 1 + 2 probes with two different restriction enzymes (Bgl II and Bam HI), each case showed from 3 to about 12 extragermline bands of varying intensity and in different locations from case to case. In addition, each case showed relative deletion of the J beta 1 germline band. This oligoclonal pattern of T cell receptor gene rearrangements has not been previously reported in benign or malignant T cell populations. 
1	Prognostic variables in patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma treated with MACOP-B. One hundred twenty-six patients with diffuse large-cell lymphoma were treated with methotrexate with leucovorin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone, and bleomycin (MACOP-B) between April 1981 and June 1986. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using overall survival as of September 1989 as the end point. Four independent negative predictors of survival were identified: presence of B symptoms; more than two involved lymph node sites; more than one extranodal site (variables related to tumor burden), and age older than 60, a variable related to the patient's ability to tolerate treatment. Each variable contributed the same relative risk of dying and, accordingly, this simple predictive formula was developed empirically: (4-N) x 30 = the approximate percentage of chance of survival at 5 years. "N" is the number of predictive variables present. The same four predictors were also found to be significant by multivariate analysis when only those patients achieving a complete response were analyzed. 
4	Dietary Ca2+ prevents NaCl-sensitive hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats by a sympatholytic mechanism. The current study tested the hypothesis that dietary Ca2+ supplementation reverses the NaCl-sensitive component of hypertension and the associated neurochemical abnormalities in the NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR-S). Male SHR-S were begun on one of four diets at 8 weeks of age: control (0.75% NaCl/0.68% Ca2+); high NaCl (8.00% NaCl/0.68% Ca2+); high Ca2+ (0.75% NaCl/2.00% Ca2+); and high NaCl/high Ca2+ (8.00% NaCl/2.00% Ca2+). High NaCl SHR-S (X2 weeks) had higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) (161 +/- 4 mm Hg) than controls (149 +/- 3 mm Hg; P less than .05). Supplementation with Ca2+ prevented the rise in MAP in high NaCl rats, but did not alter MAP in controls. The 8% NaCl diet elevated plasma norepinephrine and reduced anterior hypothalamic (AHA) norepinephrine stores and turnover; concomitant Ca2+ supplementation restored both plasma norepinephrine and AHA norepinephrine turnover to normal. Clonidine was microinjected into the AHA of rats maintained on the four diets for 2 weeks to test the hypothesis that dietary Ca2+ supplementation prevents the previously observed NaCl-induced upregulation of alpha 2-adrenoceptors in AHA. Clonidine caused dose-dependent decreases in MAP that were greater in high NaCl rats than in controls. The Ca2+ supplementation prevented the exaggerated depressor response to clonidine in the high NaCl group, but not in the controls. The Ca2+ supplementation had no effect on pretreatment MAP or on MAP responses to clonidine in control NaCl-resistant SHR (SHR-R) or Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Thus, dietary Ca2+ supplementation prevents the NaCl-induced exacerbation of hypertension and augmented depressor response to clonidine in SHR-S by increasing noradrenergic input to AHA, thereby preventing the upregulation of AHA alpha 2-adrenoceptors. 
3	Prenatal diagnosis of fetal intracranial calcifications. A case is presented wherein fetal intracranial calcifications as a result of intrauterine cytomegalovirus infection were visualized by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging at 36 weeks' gestation. Diagnosis of in utero cytomegalovirus infection was made by isolation of the virus from amniotic fluid. No symptomatic abnormality has been noted in the neonatal period except periventricular calcifications. 
5	Lower extremity revascularization via the lateral plantar artery. Lower extremity bypass grafts to the tibial and crural arteries are commonly employed to treat patients with atherosclerotic limb-threatening ischemia. Although occasional series have mentioned bypasses to a plantar artery, few of these specifically examine the results of arterial reconstructions using these vessels. Six patients underwent femoral to lateral plantar artery (LPA) bypass within a 19-month period for gangrene of the forefoot. There was one early graft failure and in the five completely autogenous reconstructions, graft patency and limb salvage had been achieved during a follow-up ranging from three to 22 months. The LPA is an acceptable site for anastomosis of lower extremity bypass grafts and the early results presented herein support its more liberal use when proximal sites are unavailable. 
5	The radiologic morphology of painful temporomandibular joints. A high frequency of remodeling changes was demonstrated radiographically in a series of patients having pain in the temporomandibular joint region. Radiologic morphologic differences between painful and asymptomatic temporomandibular joints were in frequency rather than type. Caution should be taken not to overestimate the significance of radiologic abnormality in patients with pain in the temporomandibular joint region. 
4	Cumulative AIDS incidence and altered mortality from bacterial infections. To determine whether populations with high cumulative incidence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) experienced increased deaths from sepsis, central nervous system abscess, or endocarditis, New Jersey AIDS patients were grouped according to their age, sex, race, and residence-specific cumulative incidence of AIDS since the onset of the AIDS epidemic. Between 1980 and 1986, among 25-44 year olds in the highest cumulative incidence group for AIDS, sepsis mortality increased from 3.3 to 15.2 deaths/100,000/year, an increase of 11.9 deaths/100,000/year (95% confidence interval (6.9, 17.0) deaths/100,000/year); mortality from central nervous system abscesses increased from zero to 1.7 (0.1, 3.2) deaths/100,000/year; and mortality from endocarditis increased from 0.8 deaths/100,000/year to 2.4 deaths/100,000/year, an increase of 1.6 (-0.5, 3.7) deaths/100,000/year. Age-matched New Jersey patient populations with low cumulative incidence of AIDS did not sustain a similar increase. The HIV disease-associated increase in sepsis mortality among young populations represents a new component of the substantial increase in U.S. sepsis mortality that occurred over the last two decades, but was previously limited to older populations. 
5	Relative effects of brain and non-brain injuries on neuropsychological and psychosocial outcome. Based on the 242 consecutive surviving head injury cases and 132 general trauma cases, this study examined the contribution of brain and non-brain injuries to cognitive and psychosocial outcome 1 month postinjury. The study also examined the relationships among various head injury severity indices. The head injury severity indices were all correlated but patients with Glasgow Coma Scale scores in the mild range had broadly ranging scores on the other head injury severity indices (Abbreviated Injury Scale and time to follow commands). Neuropsychological outcome was related to brain injury severity, but was not independently influenced by severity of other systems injuries. Psychosocial outcome related to both brain and non-brain injuries independently. When evaluating trauma outcome, it is important to consider the contributions of both brain and other system injuries. 
4	Hypertension, cigarette smoking, and the decline in stroke incidence in eastern Finland. Finland has high rates of both cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular disease risk factors. We studied random samples of the population 30-59 years of age for risk factors in two provinces of eastern Finland in 1972 and 1977. We then followed both cohorts until 1985 through linkage with national hospital discharge and death certificate registers. The prevalence of hypertension and smoking in both provinces declined between 1972 and 1977, as did the stroke incidence in the 8-year period of follow-up of each cohort. We observed no differences in stroke incidence between the two provinces. The relative risk of stroke in the later period (1977-1985) was 0.71 and 0.58 for men and women, respectively, when compared with the earlier period (1972-1980). Overall, 28% of all stroke events could be attributed to hypertension, 17% to smoking, and 43% to these two factors jointly. The decrease in the prevalence of hypertension and smoking accounted for about 29% of the decline. 
5	Transrectal ultrasonography of rectal carcinoma. Preoperative transrectal ultrasonographic staging of 38 patients with known adenocarcinoma of the rectum was performed. Six of these patients had preoperative radiation therapy. Of the 32 without radiation therapy, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) correctly staged disease limited to the rectum in 90% (18 of 20) and transmural extension in 50% (6 of 12), for a sensitivity for evaluating transmural extension of 50%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 75%, and a negative predictive value of 25%. Nineteen patients had positive nodes. The sensitivity and specificity of detecting nodal metastases by TRUS were 63% and 85%. The positive and negative predictive values were 86% and 61%, respectively. TRUS was slightly superior to digital rectal examination in staging patients because of its superior ability to detect adenopathy. Adjacent organ involvement was correctly evaluated in five of six patients; peritumoral fibrosis was misinterpreted as tumor extension into uterus and ovary in one woman. Tumor shrinkage in all patients undergoing radiation therapy was identified, but fibrosis and edema made staging by TRUS unreliable in those patients. 
5	Acute gastroenteritis in infants under 6 months old. Sixty two babies under the age of 6 months who were admitted with gastroenteritis completed a study of gradual refeeding compared with abrupt refeeding after a period of rehydration. There was no difference in the incidence of recurrence of diarrhoea due to lactose intolerance, effect on weight, or duration of hospital stay. Twenty six babies (42%) had recurrence of diarrhoea after refeeding, all of whom settled with the introduction of a lactose free soya based formula. Well nourished babies under 6 months of age with mild to moderately severe gastroenteritis can be fed immediately with full strength milk feeds after rehydration. The introduction of a lactose free soya based preparation may provide an alternative to repeated attempts at regrading with cows' milk feeds in those patients with lactose intolerance. 
3	Value of plasmapheresis in hepatic encephalopathy. Plasmapheresis is used for treating the complications of liver failure. We performed plasmapheresis on 6 children with hepatic encephalopathy resulting from acute hepatic failure and prospectively assessed its effects on neurologic and electrophysiologic (electroencephalography and evoked potentials) function. Clinical improvement was observed in 3 of 6 patients; changes in the serum ammonia value or the results of initial electrophysiologic tests did not predict the patient response. Two patients underwent transplantation after neurologic improvement was produced by plasmapheresis; however, despite plasmapheresis, 4 patients progressed to brain death. Our data demonstrate that plasmapheresis may transiently improve the encephalopathy of acute hepatic failure but is not curative alone. Therefore, plasmapheresis may be a useful adjunct in the treatment of liver failure, potentially improving the pretransplantation status of the patient. 
3	Cerebral infarction in patients with nephrotic syndrome. We describe two adult patients who presented with acute cerebral infarction and were found to have a hypercoagulable state due to nephrotic syndrome. One patient had a deficiency of free protein-S. The other patient had a pulmonary embolus 4 months after the stroke. Our cases demonstrate that the hypercoagulable state associated with nephrotic syndrome can be associated with cerebral arterial thrombosis and infarction in adults. Examination of the urine remains an important part of the evaluation of patients with recent stroke. The presence of severe proteinuria and a low serum albumin content should prompt consideration of a hypercoagulable state. Our experience suggests that anticoagulant drugs may be required to reduce the risk of new thrombotic events. 
4	Post-extrasystolic potentiation without a compensatory pause in normal and diseased hearts. Variables derived from left ventricular volume were used to study post-extrasystolic potentiation. Left ventriculograms were obtained from 11 healthy individuals and 49 patients with coronary heart disease (30 with a previous myocardial infarction and 19 without any signs of myocardial damage). Post-extrasystolic potentiation was induced by a regularly driven right atrial rhythm that was interrupted by one atrial extrasystole in such a way that the post-extrasystolic RR interval was kept equal to the basic RR interval. The left ventricular end diastolic volumes of the pre-extrasystolic and post-extrasystolic beats were equal. In all groups there was evidence of post-extrasystolic potentiation in one or more of the indices of left ventricular function (ejection fraction, mean normalised systolic ejection rate, and systolic volume, and stroke volume). Potentiation was especially evident in patients with left ventricular damage; this suggests that a compensating mechanism is an intrinsic property of the myocardium. The Frank-Starling mechanism does not contribute to the increased performance of the post-extrasystolic beat in normal individuals or in patients with coronary artery disease. 
5	Disturbances in the cerebral perfusion of human immune deficiency virus-1 seropositive asymptomatic subjects: a quantitative tomography study of 18 cases. Quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by xenon-133 (133Xe) tomography, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), psychometric tests, and laboratory analyses were performed on 18 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) seropositive asymptomatic subjects. Abnormalities of cerebral perfusion were observed in 16 cases (88%). These abnormalities were particularly frequent in the frontal regions (77% of cases). MRI demonstrated leucoencephalopathy in only two cases. EEG showed only induced diffuse abnormalities in two cases. Psychometric tests showed restricted moderate disturbances in 55% of patients. These disturbances mostly concerned those sectors involved in cognitive functions and memorization. These results indicate that quantitative measurements of CBF by 133Xe-SPECT is capable of detecting abnormalities of cerebral perfusion at a very early stage (Phase II) of HIV-1 infection. These abnormalities are indications of disturbances resulting from unidentified metabolic or vascular lesions. This technique appears to be superior to MRI at this stage of the disease's development. It could provide objective information leading to earlier treatment, and prove useful in evaluating potential antiviral chemotherapy. 
5	Hypothalamic obesity due to hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis. A case is presented of 14 year old female with hypothalamic obesity due to hydrocephalus caused by aqueductal stenosis. Evidence of hypothalamic obesity included 1) acute hyperphagia and weight gain, 2) neuroradiology showed hydrocephalus with focal enlargement of the third ventricle, 3) endocrinological studies revealed hyperinsulinaemia and impaired growth hormone (GH) response to arginine, but normal GH response to growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) and 4) Torkildsen's ventriculo-cisternal shunting resulted in improvement in hyperphagia and obesity. 
3	Peripheral neuropathy associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. In 1989, the Centers for Disease Control recognized the existence of an epidemic illness characterized by myalgia and eosinophilia in individuals taking preparations containing L-tryptophan. We evaluated 3 patients with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome who presented with subacute progressive neuropathies. The neuropathies were predominantly motor and maximal in the lower extremities. Two patients were confined to a wheelchair and one was ventilator-dependent and bedridden. Sensory loss predominantly involved small fiber modalities. Electrophysiological studies showed multifocal marked conduction slowing and conduction block indicating segmental demyelination, with associated axonal degeneration that was accentuated distally. Examination of sural nerve biopsy specimens demonstrated axonal degeneration in all 3 patients and perivascular infiltrates in 2. Levels of quinolinic acid, a neurotoxic metabolite of L-tryptophan, were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid in the 2 patients in whom it was measured. The cause of the neuropathy is unknown but may include immune mechanisms or toxicity of eosinophils, L-tryptophan, its metabolic products, or contaminants within L-tryptophan preparations. 
5	Expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules in the liver of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Virus-specific T-cell responses are believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of liver cell injury secondary to hepatitis B virus infection. In this study, liver biopsy specimens from patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection were analyzed for expression of two major pathways of adhesion used by cytotoxic T cells to interact with target cells. The lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 was found preferentially expressed on hepatocytes of patients with active hepatitis B virus replication, whereas the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 on hepatocytes seemed more closely related with inflammatory activity. Adhesion molecules were also highly expressed on T lymphocytes found in areas of piecemeal and spotty necrosis, indicating the presence of antigen-specific "memory" T cells at the site of hepatocellular injury. This study suggests that the expression of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 3 on hepatocytes may be important for viral elimination. The coordinate expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 may regulate inflammatory response and enhance viral antigen presentation to T cells. Conversely, the absence of hepatocyte adhesion molecules might be a favorable factor for viral persistence. 
2	The Roux operation for postgastrectomy syndromes. The aim of this paper is to describe the technique, indications, and results of the Roux operation as used in the treatment of postgastrectomy syndromes. A Roux gastrojejunostomy with a 40-cm Roux limb is the procedure of choice for alkaline reflux gastritis, because it virtually eliminates reflux of bile and pancreatic juice into the stomach. The slow transit through a Roux limb can also be used to good advantage to slow gastric emptying in patients with dumping. Patients with delayed gastric emptying respond to the combination of near-total gastric resection, which removes the atonic gastric remnant and speeds emptying, and Roux-Y gastrojejunostomy, which prevents reflux esophagitis and provides a reservoir for ingesta in the upper gut. After all Roux operations, however, the Roux limb may slow emptying so much that pain, fullness, nausea, and food vomiting result, the so-called Roux stasis syndrome. Prevention of the Roux stasis syndrome with an "uncut" Roux limb and the treatment of the syndrome by using electrical pacing to suppress the ectopic pacemakers that emerge in the limb offer possible new solutions to this vexing problem. 
5	Anorexia in older patients: its meaning and management. In the elderly, clinically significant weight loss is closely related to malnutrition, the causes of which can proliferate in this age group. Clinicians must therefore keep a wide range of possible etiologies in mind when evaluating these patients. These fall into the general categories of social, psychological, medical, and age-related. Isolating the cause will direct what is often simple, effective, and, perhaps, life-saving therapy. 
3	Effects of tromethamine and hyperventilation on brain injury in the cat. The metabolic brain acidosis after trauma has been thought to be harmful and to contribute to neurological deterioration. Amelioration of the brain acidosis either by systemic buffering agents or by hyperventilation has been proposed as a method of treatment. The objective of this study was to explore with magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy the metabolic changes in brain that occur with the use of hyperventilation, THAM (tromethamine; tris[hydroxymethyl]aminomethane), and a combination (THAM and hyperventilation) therapy in experimental fluid-percussion injury. Brain lactate, brain pH, inorganic phosphate (Pi), and adenosine triphosphate levels were measured by 1H and 31P MR spectroscopy. Arterial and cerebrovenous lactate and water content in brain tissue was determined in 29 cats using the specific gravimetric technique. Following injury, the phosphocreatine (PCr)/Pi ratio, which is an index of cerebral energy depletion, decreased to 76% in four untreated animals, to 79% in 11 THAM-treated animals, to 68% in seven animals receiving hyperventilation, and to 66% in seven animals with combination THAM and hyperventilation therapy. The PCr/Pi ratio returned to a normal level in 8 hours in animals treated with THAM and THAM in combination with hyperventilation. The brain lactate index increased to 157% in the hyperventilation group after trauma. In cats receiving THAM plus hyperventilation, the brain lactate index was reduced to 142%, while the minimum rise of 126% was associated with treatment of THAM alone. In the THAM-treatment and combination-treatment groups, the water content of the white and gray matter was significantly decreased compared with that in untreated cat brains. Prolonged hyperventilation provided relative ischemia in brain tissue and promoted more production of brain lactate, no recovery of the PCr/Pi ratio, and no decrease in brain edema. On the other hand, administration of THAM decreased production of brain lactate and brain edema and promoted the recovery of cerebral energy dysfunction. It was found that THAM ameliorates the deleterious effects of hyperventilation by minimizing energy disturbance and that it also decreases brain edema. The authors conclude that THAM may be effective in reducing brain tissue acidosis and helpful as a metabolic stabilizing agent following severe head injury. 
5	Regulatory control of the terminal complement proteins at the surface of human endothelial cells: neutralization of a C5b-9 inhibitor by antibody to CD59. Functionally inhibitory antibody to the plasma membrane complement inhibitor CD59 has been used to investigate control of the terminal complement proteins at the endothelial cell surface. Antibodies against purified human erythrocyte CD59 (polyclonal anti-CD59 and monoclonal antibodies [MoAbs] 1F1 and 1F5) were found to bind specifically to monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and by Western blotting to recognize an 18- to 21-Kd endothelial protein. When bound to the endothelial monolayer, anti-CD59 (immunoglobulin G or Fab fragment) potentiated membrane pore formation induced upon C9 binding to C5b-8, and augmented the C5b-9-induced cellular responses, including stimulated secretion of von Willebrand factor and expression of catalytic surface for the prothrombinase enzyme complex. Although potentiating endothelial responses to the terminal complement proteins, anti-CD59 had no effect on the response of these cells to stimulation by histamine. Taken together, these data suggest that human endothelial cells express the CD59 cell surface inhibitor of the terminal complement proteins, which serves to protect these cells from pore-forming and cell-stimulatory effects of the C5b-9 complex. These data also suggest that the inactivation or deletion of this cell surface regulatory molecule would increase the likelihood for procoagulant changes in endothelium exposed to complement activation in plasma. 
5	Coronary artery fistula formation secondary to permanent pacemaker placement. We present the findings in two patients who apparently developed a coronary artery fistula as a complication of an endocardial pacing electrode. This complication may actually be occurring more frequently than recognized because the patient may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and therefore not undergo a coronary angiogram. Awareness of this potentially serious complication is important and stresses the need for proper electrode placement without excess pressure on the tip. 
5	Successful CPR in a severely hypothermic patient using continuous thoracostomy lavage. Severe hypothermia with cardiopulmonary arrest often requires prolonged resuscitation while rewarming procedures are implemented. A 63-year-old male in cardiopulmonary arrest with a core body temperature of 23.7 C was resuscitated successfully after core rewarming by means of a two-chest-tube continuous thoracostomy lavage procedure. This lavage procedure resulted in effective and rapid rewarming after other conventional rewarming methods had failed. 
1	Genetic analysis of breast cancer in the cancer and steroid hormone study. The familial risk of breast cancer is investigated in a large population-based, case-control study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control. The data set is based on 4,730 histologically confirmed breast cancer cases aged 20 to 54 years and on 4,688 controls who were frequency matched to cases on the basis of both geographic region and 5-year categories of age, and it includes family histories, obtained through interviews of cases and controls, of breast cancer in mothers and sisters. Segregation analysis and goodness-of-fit tests of genetic models provide evidence for the existence of a rare autosomal dominant allele (q = .0033) leading to increased susceptibility to breast cancer. The effect of genotype on the risk of breast cancer is shown to be a function of a woman's age. Although, compared with noncarriers, carriers of the allele appear to be at greater risk at all ages, the ratio of age-specific risks is greatest at young ages and declines steadily thereafter. The proportion of cases predicted to carry the allele is highest (36%) among cases aged 20-29 years. This proportion gradually decreases to 1% among cases aged 80 years or older. The cumulative lifetime risk of breast cancer for women who carry the susceptibility allele is predicted to be high, approximately 92%, while the cumulative lifetime risk for noncarriers is estimated to be approximately 10%. 
5	A case of myelinoclastic diffuse sclerosis in an adult. We report a case of rapidly progressive cerebral demyelinating disease in a previously healthy 40-year-old woman. This case satisfies the diagnostic criteria for myelinoclastic diffuse sclerosis (MDS), but is unusual in the age of onset. This is the 1st case of MDS in an adult with full documentation of clinical, biochemical, radiographic, and pathologic features. 
3	Cytokine accumulations in CSF of multiple sclerosis patients: frequent detection of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor but not interleukin-6. We identified the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by specific radioimmunoassays in the CSF of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and other neurologic diseases (OND). There was a high incidence of detectable IL-1 beta in patients with active MS compared with inactive MS or OND patients. TNF was also more frequently present in active MS than in OND CSF. By contrast, most MS CSF did not contain detectable IL-6. There was no correlation between the degree of CSF pleocytosis and the level of individual cytokines, suggesting that cytokine accumulations may be derived from CNS, and not CSF, cells. As IL-1 beta and TNF experimentally induce astrogliosis, demyelination, temperature elevation, lassitude, and sleep, and results raise the possibility that these cytokines may contribute to a variety of manifestations in MS and in other disease states. 
1	Mixed form, diffusely scattered calcifications in breast cancer with apocrine features Diffusely scattered calcifications visible with mammography are almost always benign. Certain patterns, however, should arouse concern. For example, extensive comedocarcinoma is associated with large areas of mammographically visible calcium deposition. The authors identified 10 women in whom calcifications were visible throughout large volumes of breast tissue at mammography. The calcifications did not resemble those typical of extensive comedocarcinoma, yet they were associated with extensive breast cancer. Their mammographic pattern was characterized by a strikingly wild, chaotic appearance with profuse deposition of calcium. As in many cancers, the particles were heterogeneous, but unlike in most carcinomas, many deposits had a typically benign morphology. Histologic examination showed that even these typically benign calcifications were associated with malignant cells. The authors believe that the apocrine features displayed by many of the cancer cells in these 10 patients may explain the unusual profusion of calcium deposits. 
3	How selective is selective posterior rhizotomy? Although selective posterior rhizotomy has become an increasingly utilized surgical treatment for spasticity, the procedure is unstandardized and is performed differently at various medical centers. Most surgeons use some form of direct dorsal rootlet stimulation with intraoperative multichannel electromyographic response monitoring. Electrophysiological monitoring offers the theoretical advantage of identifying pathologic reflex circuits for interruption while preserving those pathways that are "normal." However, the monitoring technique most commonly used has not been critically evaluated and, therefore, its value remains uncertain. In 22 selective posterior rhizotomy procedures performed for spastic cerebral palsy, the authors were unable to identify a single electromyographic response that could be called normal by presently accepted criteria. Dorsal rootlets were chosen for division on the basis of relative degrees of abnormality. Intraoperative electromyographic monitoring of a nonspastic patient produced tracings suggestive of spasticity by presently accepted criteria. These discrepancies suggest that current electrophysiological monitoring in selective posterior rhizotomy should be reevaluated. 
4	Side effects of nalbuphine while reversing opioid-induced respiratory depression: report of four cases. Nalbuphine hydrochloride, an agonist-antagonist opioid, is reported to reverse the respiratory depression of moderate doses of fentanyl (20 micrograms.kg-1) and still provide good analgesia. We report four patients having abdominal aortic aneurysm repair in which we attempted to reverse the respiratory depression of large doses of fentanyl (50-75 micrograms.kg-1) with nalbuphine (0.3 mg.kg-1, 0.1 mg.kg-1 or 0.05 mg.kg-1). Nalbuphine reversed respiratory depression in all four patients and the respiratory rate increased from 10 to 23 breaths per minute, end-tidal CO2 decreased from 7.0 +/- 0.3 per cent to 5.6 +/- 0.7 per cent, and peak inspiratory pressure after 0.1 seconds increased from 4 +/- 1.4 to 13 +/- 2.6 mmHg. However, hypertension, increased heart rate, and significant increase in analogue pain scores accompanied reversal of respiratory depression. Agitation, nausea, vomiting, and cardiac dysrhythmias also were observed frequently. We do not recommend the use of nalbuphine to facilitate early extubation of the trachea after large doses of fentanyl for abdominal aortic surgery. 
1	Prognostic significance of type IV collagen and laminin immunoreactivity in urothelial carcinomas of the bladder. Invasion of a carcinoma involves the degradation and penetration of the subepithelial basement membrane (BM). This phenomenon might be used for histopathologic evaluation of neoplasms of the bladder. The authors studied the clinicopathologic data and tissue specimens of 125 cases of urothelial carcinomas collected prospectively. Penetration of the BM was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of the BM components laminin and type IV collagen. The use of this parameter as a prognostic indicator in bladder cancer was assessed. The 5-year survival rate of patients having tumors with an interrupted or absent BM was significantly lower than that of patients having tumors with an intact BM. The rate of progression was greater in tumors with an interrupted or absent BM than in tumors with an intact BM. No association was found between BM status and recurrence. However, a significant correlation between tumor stage and BM staining was found. A correlation was also found between ploidy and BM staining as well as between histologic grade and BM staining pattern. When evaluating histologic grade, stage, ploidy, age, and BM score as prognostic parameters, the stage of bladder carcinomas turned out to be the most important factor in predicting the survival rate and the progression-free survival. However, BM staining was found to be of value for early identification of microinvasion and is helpful for correct staging of urothelial carcinomas. 
1	Cancer chemotherapy after solid organ transplantation. To assess how well chemotherapy is tolerated after solid organ transplantation, we reviewed our experience at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh with five patients aged 1 to 12 years. Four patients had a liver transplant, indications for which were hepatoblastoma in two patients, hepatic failure secondary to Wilms' tumor chemoradiotherapy in one patient, and familial intrahepatic cholestasis in one patient. A fifth patient received a cardiac transplant for unresectable angiosarcoma of the right atrium. After transplant, chemotherapy was given for the treatment of the primary malignancy in four of the patients. The patient with familial intrahepatic cholestasis received chemotherapy for secondary lymphoproliferative disease that had not responded to the cessation of immunosuppression. All patients other than this patient were on immunosuppression with prednisone (0.5 to 2 mg/kg daily) and cyclosporine (to maintain serum levels at 800 to 1000 ng/ml radioimmunoassay) throughout the duration of chemotherapy. Courses of chemotherapy included one or more of the following agents: Adriamycin (Adr, 20 mg/m2 daily, three patients), Cyclophosphamide (Ctx, 1 gm/m2, one patient), cisplatin (CDDP, 90 mg/m2, one patient), Vincristine (Vcr, greater than 0.75 to 1.5 mg/m2, three patients), Actinomycin D (Act-D, 7.5 micrograms/kg, one patient), Ifosfamide (I, 1800 mg/m2, one patient) and Etoposide (VP-16, 100 mg/m2, one patient). All patients received greater than or equal to 3 courses (range, 3 to 9; mean, 5) of chemotherapy every 3 to 4 weeks. Dose reductions were made because of neutropenia in three patients but none were greater than 50%. Severe rejection was seen in one patient who had, however, manifested evidence of rejection prior to his first postoperative course of chemotherapy. No nephro or cardiac toxicity was seen. This preliminary experience suggests that chemotherapy is well tolerated after solid organ transplantation. 
5	Developmental dysmnesia in a poor reader. A 22-yr-old subject with moderate developmental dyslexia experienced poor memory from an early age. In spite of normal intelligence he had great difficulty in learning historical and geographical names, mathematical formulae, poems and songs, and verbal series such as the letters of the alphabet and the months of the year. His recognition of familiar faces was also faulty at times. A battery of memory tests confirmed a moderate deficit of verbal as well as visual memory, whereas spatial memory was preserved. Other cognitive functions were intact, except for a mild reading disability. No evidence of brain pathology was provided by his history, neurological examination and CT scanning. 
2	Phospholipids from rat, human, and canine gastric mucosa. Composition and metabolism of molecular classes of phosphatidylcholine. To validate a recent proposal that a phospholipid lining with a high content of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine may protect gastric mucosa against luminal acid, it was decided to study composition and metabolism of phospholipids in the gastric mucosa. Phospholipids were analyzed in rat, human, and dog gastric mucosal surface tissue and in a chloroform/methanol-lavage of rat and canine stomach. Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were the main components. Saturated fatty acids were almost exclusively esterified at the sn-1 position of the glycerol moiety of phosphatidylcholine, and unsaturated fatty acids mainly at the sn-2 position. The disaturated class of phosphatidylcholine comprised 2%-6% of total phosphatidylcholine. Precursors of phosphatidylcholine, i.e., [32P]orthophosphate and [methyl-14C]choline, were preferentially incorporated into the disaturated molecular class 0.5-6 hours after IV administration. It can be speculated that disaturated phosphatidylcholine, although quantitatively a minor component, is specifically triggered in mucosal renewal processes. 
1	The beta globin 3' enhancer element confers regulated expression on the human gamma globin gene in the human embryonic-fetal erythroleukemia cell line K562. We have constructed fusion genes comprised of gamma and beta globin elements and globin sequences linked to neomycin resistance (neoR) genes to define the cis acting sequences responsible for developmental stage-specific expression and induction of fetal globin genes in embryonic-fetal erythroleukemia K562 cells. The results indicate that the gamma promoter is required for proper initiation of transcription. However, the accumulation of gamma globin transcripts in response to hemin induction requires the additional presence of either gamma intervening sequence 2 or the 3' enhancer element of the beta globin gene. Thus, the gamma promoter may provide the elements for developmental stage-specific gene expression during fetal life. By contrast, the beta 3' enhancer is erythroid-specific but not developmental stage- or gene-specific. 
2	Pressure measurements from biliary and pancreatic segments of sphincter of Oddi. Comparison between patients with functional abdominal pain, biliary, or pancreatic disease. Using a minimally compliant infusion system and a triple-lumen pressure recording catheter, we obtained endoscopic manometric measurements from both the common bile duct and pancreatic duct segments of the sphincter of Oddi (SO) in 58 patients. Fifteen patients (ages 27-69) had the diagnosis of functional abdominal pain, 19 patients (ages 30-76) had partial biliary obstruction, and 24 patients (ages 15-80) had idiopathic acute recurrent pancreatitis. Resting ductal pressure was similar in the common bile duct and pancreatic duct in all patient groups. In the group with functional pain, basal SO pressure was similar, whether obtained from the common bile duct or pancreatic duct sphincteric segment. Eight of 19 patients with partial biliary obstruction had elevated basal SO pressure. Five of these eight patients had elevated basal SO pressure confined exclusively to the common bile duct segment of the sphincter, while three patients had elevated basal SO in both segments. Conversely seven of 24 patients with acute recurrent pancreatitis had an elevated basal SO pressure, with five patients having pressure elevation only in the pancreatic duct segment while two patients had abnormal basal SO pressure in both segments. We conclude that selective cannulation of the common bile duct and/or the pancreatic duct during manometric study of the SO is necessary in order to diagnose segmental SO dysfunction responsible for partial biliary obstruction or episodes of acute recurrent pancreatitis. 
4	The epidemiology of impaired glucose tolerance and hypertension. Epidemiologic research indicates that glucose intolerance and hypertension are interrelated phenomena, each powerfully predisposing to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Both diabetic and hypertensive patients have greater amounts of atherogenic risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hyperuricemia, elevated fibrinogen, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Diabetic persons have an increased prevalence of hypertension (50%), and glucose intolerance is more common in hypertension (15% to 18%). Both share a strong relationship to excess weight, but the excess of hypertension in diabetic persons occurs in both lean and obese subjects. Diabetes doubles the risk of hypertension associated with overweight. The risk of coronary disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease increases with increasing blood pressure to the same degree in diabetic persons as in nondiabetic persons, but at any level of blood pressure, diabetic persons have a doubled risk of these outcomes. Both diabetic and hypertensive patients are particularly prone to silent or unrecognized myocardial infarctions. Greater efforts at primary prevention of both hypertension and diabetes are clearly needed, including efforts at weight control, exercise, limitation of salt intake, and control of blood lipid levels. In either diabetic or hypertensive candidates for cardiovascular disease, optimization of the chances of avoiding sequelae requires a comprehensive multifactorial approach. Prevention requires more than normalization of either the blood sugar or blood pressure. Rational preventive measures must also include weight reduction, a fat-modified diet, cessation of smoking cigarettes, raising high-density lipoprotein, lowering low-density lipoprotein, and reduction of fibrinogen. Hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol tend to coexist. 
3	General assay for phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid: a candidate marker for paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. The components of protein phosphorylation systems (protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and their phosphoprotein substrates) are highly enriched in neuronal cells compared with other cell types. We exploited this relative neuronal enrichment of protein phosphorylation system components to develop a general assay technique for putative protein kinase substrates (phosphoproteins) in human cerebrospinal fluid. Using this cerebrospinal fluid phosphoprotein assay, we have detected a putative protein kinase C substrate protein of apparent Mr 60 kd in 6 of 14 patients with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration but not in any of 55 patients with a variety of other neurological diseases. Phosphoproteins in cerebrospinal fluid may provide novel and unique markers for the diagnosis or staging of neuronal diseases as well as offer potential insights into the biochemical characterization of affected neuronal populations. 
4	Myocardial infarction in Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic whites. The San Antonio Heart Study. Mexican-American men experience reduced cardiovascular mortality compared with non-Hispanic white men. There is no corresponding ethnic difference in cardiovascular mortality in women. The difference in men could result either from a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease or a lower case fatality rate among Mexican-Americans. Although the incidence of cardiovascular disease in Mexican-Americans is unknown, we have collected data on prevalence of myocardial infarction in 5,148 individuals examined in the San Antonio Heart Study, a population-based survey of cardiovascular disease conducted between 1979 and 1988 in Mexican-Americans and non-Hispanic whites aged 25-64 years. Myocardial infarction was assessed by Minnesota-coded electrocardiograms and by a self-reported history of a physician-diagnosed heart attack. For both end points, the age-adjusted prevalence of myocardial infarction was lower in Mexican-American men than in non-Hispanic white men. After adjustment for age and diabetes status (present/absent), the odds of a myocardial infarction, as defined by either criterion, was approximately one third lower in Mexican-American men than in non-Hispanic white men (p = 0.06). In women, the prevalence of both myocardial infarction end points was slightly higher in Mexican-Americans than in non-Hispanic whites, although neither of these differences was significant. Although the ethnic differences in prevalence in this study were not statistically significant, their pattern parallels the pattern in the mortality due to cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the results support the hypothesis that the reduced cardiovascular mortality rate observed in Mexican-American men reflects a lower incidence of myocardial infarction rather than a reduced case fatality rate because the latter would result in a higher prevalence. 
2	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and peptic ulcer disease. Evidence has accumulated that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cause clinically important gastroduodenal ulcers. The pathogenesis, which involves the impairment of mucosal resistance to injury in an acid-peptic environment, is multifactorial and controversial. Ulcers caused by NSAIDs can occur either in mucosa inflamed because of infection with Helicobacter pylori or in histologically normal mucosa. The use of these drugs has been linked to an unexpectedly high incidence of ulcer complications, and a history of peptic ulcer disease is common in such cases. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs thus appear both to exacerbate an underlying peptic diathesis and to cause de novo ulcers. The association between the use of these drugs and ulcer complications is supported by ulcer prevalence data from cross-sectional studies, and by data from case-controlled and cohort studies, and from randomized, experimental trials. Drug-induced gastric ulcers have been prevented by misoprostol, but not by H2 blocker therapy. Several therapies have been reported to promote ulcer healing despite continued use of NSAIDs, but adequate controlled trials have not been done. Small gastric and duodenal ulcers readily heal, whereas larger gastric ulcers require vigorous and prolonged therapy. The relative efficacies of various therapies in preventing ulcers, healing ulcers, or preventing complications remain to be established. 
5	Exogenous opioids in human breast milk and acute neonatal neurobehavior: a preliminary study. Opioid analgesia requirements, distribution into breast milk, and influence on neonatal neurobehavior were evaluated in ten parturient-neonate pairs nursing after elective cesarean section during epidural anesthesia. Five patients received first a loading dose of intravenous meperidine after umbilical cord clamping, then patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous meperidine, and finally meperidine tablets as needed. Five patients received morphine in the same manner. Treatment groups showed no differences with respect to neonatal Apgar scores or visual analog scale (VAS) pain or satisfaction scores at 24 and 48 h postpartum. Breast milk specimens, obtained at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h postpartum and analyzed for opioids and metabolites, showed persistently elevated normeperidine concentrations in the meperidine group. A blinded psychologist evaluated each infant once on the 3rd day of life with the Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS). A priori, the "alertness" and three "human orientation" outcomes of the NBAS were chosen for analysis as best measures of opioid-induced effects. On all four outcomes, neonates in the morphine group scored significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than neonates in the meperidine group. We conclude that post-cesarean delivery PCA with morphine provides equivalent maternal analgesia and overall satisfaction as that provided by PCA with meperidine, but with significantly less neurobehavioral depression among breast-fed neonates on the 3rd day of life. 
1	The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Peoples Republic of China. Meta-analysis on data from 16 (two volunteer and 14 endoscopic) studies ahs been performed to investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomachs of individuals within the Peoples Republic of China. In this survey covering 2216 cases (89 volunteers and 2127 endoscopy patients), the incidence of H. pylori infection in 15- to 22-yr-old healthy volunteers, and in 13- to 88-yr-old symptomatic patients undergoing gastroscopy was 49.4% and 64.5%, respectively. The frequency of H. pylori infection in chronic gastritis (63.6%), gastric ulcer (71.9%), and duodenal ulcer disease (73.1%) differed significantly from that in histologically normal individuals (8.2%), confirming the relationship of H. pylori infection with those disease states. We found no significant association between H. pylori infection and symptoms. 
3	Coagulation-fibrinolysis abnormalities in acute and chronic phases of cerebral thrombosis and embolism. We assayed plasma concentrations of fibrinogen, fibrinopeptide A, plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex, D dimer, and antithrombin III activity in 40 patients with cerebral thrombosis and nine patients with cerebral embolism during the acute (less than 7 days), subacute (7-27 days), and chronic (greater than or equal to 28 days) periods and compared these with 69 controls. In cerebral thrombosis, fibrinogen and fibrinopeptide A levels were elevated significantly in all stages (p less than 0.001), whereas plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex and D dimer levels were elevated significantly in the subacute and chronic periods. The antithrombin III activity was significantly decreased in the acute stage. The elevation of fibrinogen and plasmin-alpha 2 plasmin inhibitor complex levels in the acute stage was significantly greater in patients with an infarct size greater than 10 mm2 compared to patients with an infarct size less than 10 mm2. We observed similar changes in patients with cerebral embolism. These results suggest that enhanced coagulation exists at all stages and endogenous fibrinolysis is activated in the subacute and chronic periods in a large proportion of patients with cerebral thrombosis and embolism. 
1	Isolated primary aldosteronism in a patient with adrenal carcinoma and XY/XXY mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome. Although breast cancer, germ cell tumors and other neoplasms are known to occur in patients with Klinefelter's syndrome, adrenal carcinoma has not yet been reported in such patients. We describe a rare case of severe primary aldosteronism as the unique manifestation of a large adrenocortical carcinoma in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome. Complete biological and hormonal evaluation was performed. Surgical treatment was successful and the patient remained asymptomatic with normal biological and hormonal values after 1 year of followup. 
4	Reversal of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy by antihypertensive therapy. Cardiovascular hypertrophy, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, and arteriolar hypertrophic changes are common in established hypertension. Left ventricular hypertrophy, in particular, markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular complications and death. The ability of an antihypertensive agent to reverse hypertrophic changes could, therefore, be greatly advantageous. Clinical studies with beta-blockers have shown them able to substantially reduce left ventricular hypertrophy. For reversal of arteriolar hypertrophy, vasodilatory beta-blockers have been shown to be preferable to ordinary beta-blockers, possibly because vasodilation reduces vascular smooth-muscle tone, which may facilitate reversal of hypertrophy. Theoretically, a vasodilatory beta-blocker, such as celiprolol, would therefore appear to offer advantages because of its ability to reverse left ventricular and arteriolar hypertrophy in addition to its antihypertensive action. The practical and clinical effects of cardiovascular hypertrophy reversal remain to be fully evaluated; however, it is logical to assume that they would be of considerable benefit to the hypertensive patient. 
5	Brain and spinal cord hemorrhage in long-term survivors of malignant pediatric brain tumors: a possible late effect of therapy. Three children with malignant primary CNS tumors treated with craniospinal radiotherapy developed intraparenchymal hemorrhages a median of 5 years following therapy in sites distant from the primary tumor. Radical surgical procedures disclosed fresh and old hematoma, gliosis, and necrosis in all 3 patients and an aggregation of abnormal microscopic blood vessels in two. No tumor was found. All 3 patients remain in long-term (greater than 10 years) continuous remission. 
4	Cause of death in an emergency department A retrospective review was done of 601 consecutive emergency department deaths. Nontrauma causes accounted for 77% of the deaths and this group had an average age of 64 years and a male to female ratio of 1.9:1. Trauma caused 23% of the fatalities and this group had a younger average age of 29 years and a male to female ratio of 4.6:1. The most common causes of nontrauma death were sudden death of uncertain cause (34%), coronary artery disease (34%), cancer (5%), other heart disease (4%), chronic obstructive lung disease (3%), drug overdose (3%), and sudden infant death syndrome (2%). The most common causes of trauma death were motor vehicle accidents (61%) and gunshot wounds (16%). The overall autopsy rate was 40%. Death certificates were often in error. 
5	Site of action of continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block. Continuous extrapleural intercostal nerve block has been shown in a randomized, controlled study to be effective in reducing postoperative pain after thoracotomy and in restoring pulmonary mechanics. To assess the extent of spread of bupivacaine infused through an extrapleurally placed cannula inserted at thoracotomy, iohexol (Omnipaque) was infused at 5 days postoperatively in 5 patients and computed tomography performed. The contrast medium was confined to the paravertebral space covering on average six intercostal spaces. This study demonstrated that anatomically, the site of action of the bupivacaine infused through an extrapleural cannula was primarily in the paravertebral space. 
5	Survival with regional and distant metastases from cutaneous malignant melanoma. The clinical course of 312 consecutive patients after initial presentation with metastatic melanoma, 165 of whom presented with regional metastases at cutaneous or subcutaneous, or both, nodal sites and 147 with metastases at distant sites, was reviewed. The five year survival rate for regional metastases was 43.4 per cent compared with a five year survival rate for distant metastases of 4.9 per cent (p less than 0.0001). Favorable prognostic variables for survival from first regional metastases included primary melanoma sites on the extremities compared with the head, neck and trunk (p = 0.043) and a disease-free interval of more than one year from primary surgical treatment to regional metastases (p = 0.0058). Favorable prognostic variables for survival from the first distant metastasis included a disease-free interval of more than one year from primary surgical treatment to distant metastases (p = 0.0092), the type of resection of metastatic disease (p = 0.00027) and the addition of systemic immunotherapy (p = 0.0011). Forty-nine patients with totally resectable distant metastases had a five year survival rate from the treatment of the initial metastasis of 13.1 per cent, whereas 33 patients having palliative resections had a five year survival rate of 7.5 per cent. All 165 patients who did not have resection for distant metastases died within five years. The results of our experience support therapeutic efforts to ablate both regional and distant metastases of malignant melanoma when feasible. 
5	Short-term and long-term changes in renal function after donor nephrectomy. We retrospectively examined the effect of nephrectomy on renal function in 55 living related donors. Renal function was measured with 131iodine-orthoiodohippurate scans. All patients were studied preoperatively, and 1 week and 1 year postoperatively. In 20 patients 10-year followup was available. Compensatory hypertrophy was complete 1 week postoperatively: effective renal plasma flow of the remaining kidney was 32.5% higher than preoperatively. The increase remained stable for at least a year. The degree of compensatory hypertrophy was significantly greater in male patients (46.9% after 1 week) than in female patients (26.7%). Compensatory hypertrophy occurred in all age groups studied and it was most pronounced in patients less than 30 years old. In the patients followed for 10 years effective renal plasma flow decreased from 387.7 ml. per minute 1 week after nephrectomy to 367.4 ml. per minute at 10 years. This result is similar to the decrease seen in the normal population. According to our results, renal donation by living related persons does not lead to long-term decrease in renal function. 
4	A single cholesterol measurement underestimates the risk of coronary heart disease. An empirical example from the Lipid Research Clinics Mortality Follow-up Study. In prospective epidemiologic studies of coronary heart disease, a single measurement of cholesterol is made to assess its relationship to the risk of coronary disease. Statistical theory states that if this measurement is subject to within-individual variability, the strength of the relationship will be underestimated. This is empirically shown for the example of plasma cholesterol. For the Lipid Research Clinics Follow-up Study population (comprising 2170 white men over 30 years of age), the age-adjusted coronary heart disease mortality regression coefficient increases from .453 to .496 if the average of two cholesterol measurements is used instead of a single measurement. Since the correlation between the two repeated cholesterol measurements is .815, an increase in the regression coefficient up to .556 would be expected if the true cholesterol values were available. Thus, epidemiologic studies have substantially underestimated the strength of the relationship between cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary disease by calculating the relationship on the basis of a single cholesterol determination. 
1	Predicting distant metastases in operable breast cancer patients. Risk factors for distant metastases following mastectomy and axillary node dissection for breast cancer were analyzed in a review of 1022 women. From diagnosis until the end of the adjuvant treatment, six stages were identified that corresponded well to patient data acquisition. At each stage, a prognosis study based on the Cox model was carried out using all acquired information from the first stage. The results demonstrated that tumor size, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic index, and nodal status at the top of axilla were stable independent risk factors in predicting metastasis-free survival (MFS). These analyses also revealed those factors that were significantly related to MFS at one or several stages and losing their significance at a subsequent stage. This was the case with clinical node status, age, and vascular tumor emboli. Other factors such as estrogen, progesterone, histologic grade, and clinical stage were never identified as independent factors at any stage. The four major stable risk factors were used to define a stratification of reference. The results demonstrated that the mere knowledge of clinical information such as tumor size, clinical node status, and age would enable 51% of the patients to be universally well classified according to that stratification. Knowledge of additional factors, such as nuclear pleomorphism and mitotic index, would bring the rate up to 61%, and then to 64% if supplementary information such as vascular tumor emboli were acquired. These percentages did not appear high enough to claim that the physician may make a reliable prognosis of operable breast cancer patients before acquiring information from the axillary node dissection. However, it was proven that there exist some subsets of patients with stable prognosis, i.e., subsets of patients who will belong permanently to the same risk group through the stages. 
4	Effects of alpha 1-blockade on arterial compliance in normotensive and hypertensive rats. The effects of blockade of alpha 1-adrenergic receptors on the mechanical properties of the arterial wall were studied in 10 spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as compared with 10 matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Ascending aortic pressure and flow were recorded in open-chest anesthetized rats, and the systemic arterial compliance was calculated. Intravenous injection (1 mg/kg) of Urapidil, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, induced a significant decrease in arterial pressure (-26%, p less than 0.01 and -37%, p less than 0.001 in WKY rats and SHR, respectively) without significant changes in cardiac output. In control conditions, systemic arterial compliance was lower in SHR (3.29 +/- 1.52 microliters/mm Hg) than in WKY rats (4.35 +/- 1.35 microliters/mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Urapidil injection induced significant increases in systemic arterial compliance values in both strains (p less than 0.001). In another set of experiments (15 WKY rats and 15 SHR), the carotid compliance (microliters/mm Hg) was determined from the arterial volume-pressure relation under control conditions, after local incubation with Urapidil, and after total abolition of the vascular smooth muscle by KCN. In WKY rats, the carotid compliance increased markedly after incubation with Urapidil at doses corresponding to 1 mg/kg (+31%, p less than 0.01). A further increase in the carotid compliance was observed after KCN poisoning (+11%, p less than 0.05). In SHR, incubation with Urapidil at doses corresponding to 2 mg/kg were necessary to induce a significant increase in compliance (+38%). At this dosage, there was no further increase in compliance after KCN poisoning. 
4	Association between blood pressure and serum lipids in a population. The Tromso Study. BACKGROUND. High blood pressure has been associated with elevated atherogenic blood lipid fractions, but epidemiological surveys often give inconsistent results across population subgroups. A better understanding of the relation between blood pressure and blood lipids may provide insight into the mechanism(s) whereby hypertension is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. METHODS AND RESULTS. We assessed the cross-sectional relations of serum total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol (total minus HDL cholesterol), and triglyceride levels with blood pressure in a population of 8,081 men 20-54 years old and 7,663 women 20-49 years old. Stratified analyses and multivariable methods were used to control for potential confounding anthropometric and lifestyle variables. Total and non-HDL cholesterol levels increased significantly with increasing systolic or diastolic blood pressure in both sexes. Men 20-29 years old had steeper regression slopes for blood pressure by total cholesterol level than did women of similar age. In men, the association between blood pressure and total cholesterol level decreased with age, whereas in women, it increased with age. Body mass index modified the relation, whereas smoking, physical activity, and alcohol consumption had little influence on the association. Triglyceride levels increased with blood pressure, but this relation was weak in lean subjects. HDL cholesterol level correlated positively with blood pressure in population subgroups having a high alcohol consumption. CONCLUSION. These results support the hypothesis that there are biological interrelations between blood pressure and blood lipids that may influence the mechanisms whereby blood pressure is associated with risk of coronary heart disease. 
1	Indium-labeled anti-colorectal carcinoma monoclonal antibody accumulation in non-tumored tissue in patients with colorectal carcinoma. Indium-111- (111In) labeled murine monoclonal antibodies ZCE 025 (against carcinoembryonic antigen) and CYT-103 MAb B72.3 (against tumor-associated glycoprotein - 72) have been used to image patients with colorectal cancers with encouraging results. The objectives of this study were to assess the frequency and causes of 111In MAb localization in tumor-free, benign tissues. Thus, scans of 75 patients who have undergone exploratory surgery following radioimmunoscintigraphy with 111In-ZCE 025 (n = 37) or 111In-CYT-103 (n = 38) were reviewed in conjunction with operative and histopathology reports. Localization in non-tumored tissues was seen in 10.8% and 13.1%, respectively, of patients receiving ZCE 025 and CYT-103. The most common sites involved were: degenerative joint disease, abdominal aneurysms, postoperative bowel adhesions, and local inflammatory changes secondary to surgery or external irradiation. Review of patients' medical history and results of concurrent diagnostic modalities is likely to lessen the false-positive rate of 111In-labeled MAb scan interpretation. 
2	Response to treatment of detrusor instability in relation to psychoneurotic status. A total of 53 females who entered a double-blind crossover trial of oxybutynin and placebo for idiopathic detrusor instability were questioned about life events and associated medical disorders and were given a psychometric test. Their response to treatment was studied in relation to these factors. It was found that 11% of patients had nocturnal enuresis beyond age 8 and 25% had irritable bowel syndrome: their response to treatment was generally poor. Life events were not consistently related to treatment response. The mean psychoneurotic score of "poor responders" (43.7) was similar to that of female psychoneurotic out-patients (47.7), although one-third of poor responders were normal. Patients who responded well to simple anticholinergic treatment had a mean score (30.7), which was similar to that of normal urban females (33.5). Most good responders and one-third of poor responders showed little evidence of psychoneuroticism: a further search for neurophysiological abnormality in idiopathic detrusor instability is needed. 
1	Effect of sample volume on yield of positive blood cultures from adult patients with haematological malignancy. Six hundred and sixteen blood samples from patients with haematological malignancy were each distributed equally among three identical cells in a Malthus Microbiological Growth Analyser. The mean (SD) volumes inoculated into sets in which one, two, or three of the three bottles were positive were 37.7 (10.1) ml, 37.4 (12.9) ml, and 37.7 (10.5) ml, respectively. Overall, clinically important organisms were isolated from one bottle only with 18 cultures, from two bottles only with 19 cultures, and from all three bottles in a set with 104 cultures. If the yield from a single bottle inoculated with a mean volume of 12.6 ml blood is taken as 100%, the yield from 25.2 ml in two bottles was 110.7% and the yield from 37.7 ml in three bottles was 115.6%. The increased yield from increased volume was considerably lower than that reported from unselected groups of patients, which suggests that the magnitude of bacteriaemia is greater in patients with neutropenia. The isolation of infecting organisms from the blood of patients with neutropenia is, however, particularly important in directing chemotherapy and consequently 45 ml blood samples from these patients continue to be requested. 
5	Quantitative analysis of antibody localization in human metastatic colon cancer: a phase I study of monoclonal antibody A33. A33 is a mouse immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that detects a heat-stable, protease- and neuraminidase-resistant epitope. The antigen is homogeneously expressed by virtually all colon cancers and in the colon mucosa but not other epithelial tissues. The biodistribution and imaging characteristics of iodine-131 (131I)-mAbA33 were studied in colorectal carcinoma patients with hepatic metastases. Antibody labeled with 2 to 5 mCi of 131I was administered intravenously (IV) 7 to 8 days before surgery at five dose levels, ranging from 0.2 mg to 50 mg, with three or more patients entered at each dose level. In addition, three patients received 2 mg 131I-mAbTA99 (an isotype-matched control mAb) together with 125I-mAbA33. Evaluation included whole-body imaging with a gamma camera, technetium-99 (99mTc)-human serum albumin blood pool scans, liver/spleen scans, abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scans, hepatic arteriograms, antibody pharmacokinetics, and assessment of antibody distribution in biopsied malignant and normal tissues. Selective mAbA33 localization to tumor tissue was demonstrated in 19 of 20 patients, and external imaging correlated with surgical inspection, pathologic examination, and tissue radioactivity. One week after antibody administration, tumor:liver ratios ranged from 6.9:1 to 100:1 and tumor:serum ratios from 4.1:1 to 25.2:1. 99mTc-albumin blood pool studies showed that liver metastases were hypovascular, emphasizing the selective localization of mAbA33 despite poor tumor-blood flow. Control mAbTA99 studies showed mAbA33 localization was antigen-specific; tumor:liver ratios were 2.3- to 45-fold higher for specific antibody. In metastatic lesions, radioisotope was localized primarily in the viable periphery; however, even the necrotic tumor core concentrated specific antibody. External imaging showed isotope visualization in some patients' large bowel; whether this represents specific antibody uptake or gastric iodine secretion is unclear. 
5	Generalized pustular psoriasis in childhood. Report of thirteen cases. Generalized pustular psoriasis is rare in children. Less than 100 cases have been reported. We describe 13 children with this type of psoriasis. Seven had acute onset of widespread sterile pustules coalescing into lakes of pus with subsequent exfoliation (the Zumbusch pattern). This usually occurred in infancy and was difficult to control; recurrences developed several times per year. Three had the subacute benign annular pattern. They tended to be older and often had resolution within several years. Three had a mixed pattern with Zumbusch flares preceded by an annular or acral pattern. Most patients had an eruption preceding the generalized pustular psoriasis and often had precipitating factors. Generally, generalized pustular psoriasis has little serious chronic morbidity. The condition in most patients was well controlled with topical therapy. Systemic steroids were not helpful. 
5	Endometriosis of the abdominal wall. Endometriosis of the abdominal wall typically occurs as a painful mass in a lower abdominal incision from previous cesarean section or hysterectomy. Most patients are young and in their active reproductive years. The histologic diagnosis requires a combination of either endometrial-like glands, endometrial stroma, or hemosiderin pigment. The diagnosis must be considered in any woman with an abdominal wall mass and a history of transabdominal gynecologic surgery. Wide excision offers the best chance to prevent recurrence. 
1	Importance of the omentum in the development of intra-abdominal metastases. Areas of trauma are preferred sites for metastatic tumour growth. In extensive intra-abdominal tumour recurrence the omentum is invariably involved. The importance of the omentum in the development of tumours at sites of intra-abdominal trauma has been investigated. Colonic anastomoses were performed in Hooded-Lister rats with and without omentectomy. Animals received intraluminal or intraperitoneal injections of a syngeneic tumour. With intraluminal injection, tumour occurred at the anastomosis and in the omentum in 38 and 43 per cent of animals respectively but following omentectomy the values were 14 and 9 per cent (omental remnant). With intraperitoneal administration tumour occurred in 53 per cent at the anastomosis and in 79 per cent in the omentum compared with 16 and 29 per cent (in omental remnant) following omentectomy. In this model a reduced ability of an anastomosis to support 'seeded' tumour following removal of the omentum is demonstrated and the development of local recurrence from spilled tumour cells during operation may be enhanced by, or be dependent on, the proximity of the omentum. 
3	Relationships of somatic symptoms to behavioral and emotional risk in young adolescents. Junior high students (n = 1508) from a midwestern community completed a health behavioral questionnaire that asked the frequency of headache and abdominal pain and of a number of behavioral and emotional risk indicators. Headache (24%) and abdominal pain (13%) were frequently reported among these young adolescents, particularly among girls. Those reporting frequent somatic complaints also reported significantly more behavioral and emotional symptoms indicative of risk (p less than 0.001). Further, the interaction between somatic complaint and gender significantly affected risk status (p less than 0.01). This interaction was greater with behavioral risk: boys with both abdominal pain and headaches reported higher behavioral risk than all other groups (p less than 0.0001). Somatic symptoms continued to account for a significant amount of variance in behavioral risk after the effects of emotional risk and age were removed. This suggests that behavioral risk and emotional risk are independently associated with somatic complaints. The evaluation of persistent somatic complaints in adolescents, particularly in boys with abdominal symptoms, should include careful examination of emotional risk factors and other health-endangering behaviors such as substance use, early sexual activity, and delinquency. 
5	IgD immune complex vasculitis in a patient with hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever. We describe a 27-year-old Dutch woman with the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome. During febrile attacks she occasionally presented with skin lesions on the distal parts of her upper and lower extremities, with the histologic picture of a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Clear perivascular deposits of IgD and C3 were presented in early lesional skin on immunofluorescence investigation. Circulating IgD immune complexes were demonstrated on several occasions, both during and in between clinical attacks. These findings are consistent with an IgD immune complex-mediated pathogenesis for the skin lesions. In 10 patients with other forms of immune complex vasculitis of the skin, minimal perivascular deposits of IgD were found in four cases. In these cases, however, IgD was never found as the solitary immunoglobulin class. 
5	Cervical rotation flaps for midface resurfacing. The midface has long served as a focus for creativity in surgical reconstruction. Full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness grafts, and distal flaps have long been used to attempt to reduplicate existing anatomy in this area. Recent reconstruction efforts have focused on the creative use of microvascular free flaps for this purpose. This article reports on the use of extensively developed regional rotation flaps as an excellent reconstructive modality for use in this area of the face. The details of surgical incisional planning are given. The nuances of surgical creation of these flaps and their rotation and suspension into place are given. The cases we have done using this technique for the past 3 years are reviewed. Our present indications for use of these flaps and their limitations are given. 
3	Experimental intracerebral hemorrhage: early removal of a spontaneous mass lesion improves late outcome. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether early removal of an experimental intracerebral mass altered cerebral blood flow, brain water content, neuropathological findings, or neurological function 24 hours later. In three experimental series, a 50-microliter balloon was inflated within the right caudate nucleus in rats. At 24 hours after inflation, we studied cerebral blood flow by quantitative autoradiography, brain specific gravity, and qualitative histopathology by light microscopy. The animals were also assessed using a simple neurological deficit scale. In each series, half of the animals had the balloon inflated for 10 minutes (Group 1), and half had the balloon inflated permanently (Group 2). After transient inflation, there were surprisingly small differences in the blood flow between the two cerebral hemispheres at 24 hours. By contrast, in animals with permanent inflation, several indices of blood flow were significantly worse in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the balloon: the mean and median blood flow levels in the caudate nucleus; the mean blood flow in the cerebral cortex; and the area of cortex with ischemic levels of blood flow. The specific gravity was reduced in areas surrounding the site of balloon insertion after either transient or permanent inflation, and there was evidence of ischemic cell damage in all animals studied. These changes were more severe after permanent inflation, but the differences were not significant. Neurological outcome was significantly better after transient as compared with permanent inflation. The present findings contradict previous results and suggest that early removal of an intracerebral mass may have subsequent benefits. 
4	Coronary blood flow in dogs with contractile dysfunction due to experimental volume overload. BACKGROUND. Abnormalities in coronary blood flow are responsible for stress-induced reductions in contractile function in pressure overload hypertrophy. Less is known about coronary blood flow in volume overload. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that coronary blood flow abnormalities were responsible for contractile abnormalities in experimental volume overload hypertrophy. METHODS AND RESULTS. We examined coronary blood flow at rest and during pacing in seven dogs with contractile dysfunction secondary to chronic experimental mitral regurgitation (average regurgitant fraction at 3 months, 0.58 +/- 0.05). After 3 months of mitral regurgitation, left ventricular mass had increased from 92 +/- 8 g at baseline to 118 +/- 10 g (p less than 0.002). The slope of the end-ejection stress-volume relation, one of our indexes used to estimate contractile function, had fallen from 5.4 +/- 0.3 at baseline to 3.0 +/- 0.3 at 3 months of mitral regurgitation (p less than 0.001). In the mitral regurgitation dogs, coronary blood flow at rest was similar to that of control dogs (endocardial blood flow: control dogs, 1.33 +/- 0.12 ml/min/g; mitral regurgitation dogs, 1.16 ml/min/g, p = NS; epicardial blood flow at rest: control dogs, 1.30 +/- 0.16 ml/min/g; mitral regurgitation dogs 1.13 +/- 0.2 ml/min/g, p = NS). With pacing-induced stress, coronary blood flow increased appropriately in control and mitral regurgitation dogs. Ultrasonic dimension gauges placed in the endocardium and epicardium demonstrated no further deterioration in ventricular function during pacing in the mitral regurgitation dogs. In a separate group of five control dogs and five dogs with mitral regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction, coronary blood flow was examined in the conscious closed-chest state at rest, during adenosine infusion, and during rapid atrial pacing (240 beats/min). Blood flow increased similarly in both groups during pacing and adenosine infusion. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that in dogs with mitral regurgitation that have developed contractile dysfunction, abnormalities in coronary blood flow do not explain the resting contractile dysfunction. Furthermore, studies during pacing-induced stress and coronary vasodilation with adenosine demonstrate that substantial coronary blood flow reserve is present in this type of volume overload hypertrophy. 
1	Management of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. The management of soft tissue sarcomas has undergone and continues to undergo important changes. The purpose of this report is to review the presentation, diagnosis, and natural history of soft tissue sarcomas. In so doing, the importance of a careful and rigorous method of evaluation will be emphasized. Furthermore, the results of multidisciplinary treatment, with a goal towards limb salvage, will be reviewed. With appropriate and timely intervention, selected patients with pulmonary metastases may still experience long-term survival. Throughout this review, the importance of early and continuing multidisciplinary treatment and evaluation will be emphasized. 
4	Comparison of the antihypertensive efficiency of nitrendipine, metoprolol, mepindolol and enalapril using ambulatory 24-hour blood pressure monitoring. In a randomized 6-month study of 201 patients, the antihypertensive efficiency of the calcium antagonist nitrendipine, the beta 1-selective blocker metoprolol, mepindolol, the beta blocker with intrinsic activity and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril were compared as monitored by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) measurements. The study was designed so that a comparable decrease in casual BP values was obtained with all 4 drugs. If normotension was not achieved with monotherapy, a diuretic also was administered. Pretreatment casual BP and mean 24-hour ambulatory BP values did not differ between the 4 groups. Normotension as assessed by casual BP measurements was observed in all 4 groups after 6 months of therapy, there being no significant differences between the groups. However, significantly more diuretics were required in the mepindolol (n = 14) and in the enalapril (n = 20) groups compared to the nitrendipine (n = 5) and metoprolol (n = 7) groups. Despite comparable casual BP control, the 4 groups differed significantly in their mean 24-hour measurements. The greatest systolic and diastolic BP decreases were seen in the metoprolol group. Metoprolol was also the most effective drug in decreasing the frequency of systolic pressure peaks greater than 180 mm Hg. Both beta blockers and enalapril significantly decreased the morning BP increase compared to the values before treatment, while nitrendipine did not. These data show that casual BP measurement is not a good predictor of 24-hour BP in patients taking hypertensive therapy. Despite an equal degree of "office" BP control, different antihypertensive regimens do not confer the same degree of "nonoffice" BP control. 
5	Non-ossicle homograft bone prostheses in the middle ear. This thesis proposes the use of human cadaver non-ossicle temporal homograft bone as middle ear reconstructive material. Bone obtained from the otic capsule histologically resembles that of the ossicles more so than any other bone in the body. The otic capsule, due to its proximity to the middle ear, can be harvested with the middle ear structures when bone cores are obtained, making it easily accessible. These prostheses are cost effective because multiple prostheses can be sculptured from one temporal bone core. This paper further proposes the use and introduction of non-ossicle homografts in primary stapedectomy, as well as in selected cases to bypass the incus and the superstructure of the stapes. Audiological data is provided. Some of the grafts have been in the middle ear for up to 5 years. There have been no extrusions and no complications. The method of harvesting, preservation, and sterilization is presented, as well as a pictorial illustration of the finished product and its relation to the natural ossicles. One histological specimen is presented. On the basis of the audiologic results, as well as the fact that no ossicles have extruded and none have been resorbed, it is proposed that non-ossicle temporal bone homografts have a place in transplantation surgery. 
1	A prospective randomized comparison of protracted infusional 5-fluorouracil with or without weekly bolus cisplatin in metastatic colorectal carcinoma. A Mid-Atlantic Oncology Program study. One hundred eighty-four patients with advanced measurable colorectal cancer not previously treated with chemotherapy were entered into a prospective randomized clinical trial by the Mid-Atlantic Oncology Program (MAOP) to assess the value of weekly cisplatin (20 mg/m2) when added to a protracted schedule of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion (PIF) at 300 mg/m2/d for 10 weeks of every 12 weeks. The liver was the primary indicator lesion in approximately 75% of the study group. All tumor measurements required radiographic confirmation. The response rate in the PIF alone arm was 35% (29 of 83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25% to 46%) compared with 33% (28 of 85; 95% CI, 23% to 44%) for the arm in which weekly cisplatin was added to PIF. The median survival times were 11.8 and 11.2 months in the two groups. Weekly cisplatin does not appear to add to the effectiveness of PIF in colorectal carcinoma.
