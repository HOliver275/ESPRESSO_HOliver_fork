Mortality, neoplasia, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone in the United Kingdom OBJECTIVE--To determine the cause of death and incidence of neoplasia in patients treated with human pituitary growth hormone. DESIGN--A long term cohort study established to receive details of death certification and tumour registrations through the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys and NHS central register. PATIENTS--All patients (1246 male, 662 female) treated for short stature with pituitary growth hormone under the Medical Research Council working party and health services human growth hormone committee. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Death or development of neoplasia. RESULTS--110 patients died (68 male, 42 female; aged 0.9-57 years) from 1972 to 1990. Fifty three death were from neoplasia responsible for growth hormone deficiency (27 craniopharyngioma, 24 other intracranial tumour, two leukaemia); two from histiocytosis X; and 13 from pituitary insufficiency. Six patients died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, six of other neurological disorders, and eight of acute infection. Other deaths were apparently unrelated to growth hormone deficiency or its treatment. Seventeen tumours (in 16 patients) were identified during or after growth hormone treatment. Four were in patients with previous intracranial neoplasia and two were after cranial irradiation. Thirteen were intracranial, the others being Hodgkin's lymphoma, osteosarcoma, carcinoma of colon, and basal cell carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS--Recurrence or progression of intracranial tumours and potentially avoidable metabolic consequences of hypopituitarism were the main causes of death. Growth hormone treatment probably did not contribute to new tumour development. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after pituitary growth hormone treatment continues to occur in the United Kingdom. This cohort must remain under long term review. 
The efficacy of chlorhexidine gel in reduction of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species in patients treated with radiation therapy. Xerostomia may develop in patients with cancer who receive radiotherapy that includes the salivary glands in the field. These patients are at high risk of rampant dental caries. Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species have been associated with dental caries. Quantitative counts of these organisms demonstrated high caries risk due to streptococci in 66% and due to lactobacilli in 100% of patients studied. Use of chlorhexidine rinse was shown to reduce S. mutans counts 1.1 logs and lactobacilli 1.1 logs. The use of chlorhexidine gel resulted in a reduction of S. mutans 1.2 logs and lactobacilli 2.2 logs. In the subjects using the rinse, caries risk due to streptococci was reduced to low levels in 44% and due to lactobacilli in only one subject, with reduction to moderate risk in one third and no change in risk in the remaining patients. The use of chlorhexidine gel was found to reduce the caries risk associated with streptococci to low levels in all patients, and the risk associated with lactobacilli to low and moderate risk in two thirds of patients. 
Intraoperative evaluation of intestinal ischemia: a comparison of methods. Methods for evaluating intestinal ischemia include standard clinical criteria, Doppler ultrasonography, and intravenous fluorescein injection. Each has disadvantages, and a combination of methods is often used. The purpose of this study was to determine whether surface oximetry could be used to assess perfusion in an animal whose intestinal diameter approximates that of infants. Reversible arterial, venous, and arteriovenous occlusion was studied in rabbit intestines. After 6 to 8 hours of occlusion, intestinal vascularity was evaluated by the four methods listed. Doppler ultrasonography and surface oximetry were found to be unreliable tools for assessing perfusion in this animal model. We conclude that standard clinical criteria and fluorescein remain the standards for intraoperative evaluation of intestinal perfusion. 
Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with myocardial dysfunction and acute leukemia. The role of amsacrine in inducing remission in patients with cardiac disease and acute leukemia was evaluated. There were 17 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and one with biphenotypic leukemia. In this series of 24 patients whose disease had relapsed and who had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, nine had a complete remission, seven with AML and two with ALL. In addition, four of six with newly diagnosed acute leukemia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction also responded. Among nine patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy, none had morphologic changes of sufficient degree to account for drug-induced heart failure. Patients with preexisting arrhythmias received amsacrine without incident if their serum potassium level was higher than 4.0 mEq/l at the time of drug administration. Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with acute leukemia and cardiac disease. 
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma presenting as a primary tumor of the liver: presentation, diagnosis and outcome in eight patients. We report the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic features of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in eight patients in whom the disease was seen as a primary tumor of the liver. This series illustrates the variety of situations in which lymphoma might be diagnosed: (a) abdominal pain and hepatomegaly (three cases), (b) incidental finding at evaluation of a patient with cirrhosis (two cases), (c) secondary neoplasm after treatment for Hodgkin's disease (one case) and (d) complication of AIDS (two cases). In most cases, clinical and/or radiological features were nonspecific. However, the combination of the following features must be considered as suggestive: occurrence of an apparently primary hepatic tumor in an immunocompromised patient, absence of the usual serum tumor markers and increased serum lactic dehydrogenase activity. The final diagnosis was based on histological examination of specimens obtained by ultrasonically guided liver biopsies or at surgery. All cases belonged to unfavorable histological subtypes. Immunohistochemical findings on paraffin-embedded sections demonstrated the B-lymphocyte lineage of the seven tumors available for study. In the three patients without coexisting disease, complete remission was obtained by surgery alone or combined with chemotherapy. In the two patients with coexisting cirrhosis, outcome was rapidly unfavorable, with death occurring less than 3 mo after diagnosis. Among the three immunocompromised patients, two experienced a rapid unfavorable outcome, and the remaining one was in complete remission after surgery and chemotherapy. In conclusion, primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the liver arising in patients without coexisting disease has a slow progression and might be successfully treated by surgery. 
Management of hyponatremic seizures in children with hypertonic saline: a safe and effective strategy. OBJECTIVE: To study efficacy and safety of hypertonic saline administration in the management of hyponatremic seizures. DESIGN: Retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study with factorial design. SETTING: In-patient population in a university hospital. PATIENTS: All children admitted with serum sodium concentrations less than 125 mmol/L. Sixty-nine episodes of severe hyponatremia in 60 children were reviewed. Forty-one of these children presented with seizures. INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-five of 41 seizure patients received an iv bolus of 4 to 6 mL/kg body weight of 3% saline. Twenty-eight patients were treated with a benzodiazepine and/or phenobarbital with or without the subsequent administration of hypertonic saline. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen treatment failures and ten instances of apnea occurred among the 28 patients treated with benzodiazepine/phenobarbital. Administration of hypertonic saline resulted in resolution of seizures and apnea in all cases. Those patients receiving 3% saline had a higher serum sodium increase rate from 0 to 4 hrs than the remaining patients (3.1 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.7 +/- 1.2 mmol/L.hr, p less than .01). None developed subsequent neurologic deterioration or clinical manifestations of osmotic demyelination syndrome. CONCLUSION: Treatment of hyponatremic seizures with routine anticonvulsants may be ineffective and is associated with a considerable incidence of apnea. A rapid increase in the serum sodium concentration by 3 to 5 mmol/L with the use of hypertonic saline is safe and efficacious in managing acute symptomatic hyponatremia. 
Rheumatic manifestations in myelodysplastic syndromes. The myelodysplastic syndromes are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with possible transformation to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. We describe a patient with refractory anemia with excess blasts with unusual rheumatic manifestations of vasculitis, migratory synovitis, arthralgias, and myalgias. A retrospective review over a 6-month period of 162 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes found 16 patients (10%) with several rheumatic manifestations. We divided these manifestations into 4 different categories: cutaneous vasculitis, "lupus-like syndrome," neuropathy, and patients with both a rheumatic disease and a myelodysplastic syndrome. There were 7 with cutaneous vasculitis including leukocytoclastic vasculitis and other individual cases of urticarial vasculitis and panniculitis; 3 with lupus-like manifestations with histological evidence of an inflammatory process; 3 with neuropathic manifestations including peripheral neuropathy, mononeuritis with foot drop, and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy; and 3 patients in which their myelodysplastic syndrome was diagnosed after their rheumatic disease was known, including rheumatoid arthritis. Sjogren's syndrome and mixed connective tissue disease. The class with refractory anemia with excess blasts had 9 patients with rheumatic manifestations but also had the largest number of patients in the study (46/162 or 29%). Three of the 16 patients died, all from the refractory anemia with excess blasts class, reflecting the known mortality in this group of patients. We believe there is a significant association between myelodysplastic syndromes and rheumatic manifestations. 
Primary hyperaldosteronism due to a functional black (pigmented) adenoma of the adrenal cortex. The clinical and pathologic findings are reported in a case of primary hyperaldosteronism due to a functional black (pigmented) adenoma of the adrenal cortex. Cortical atrophy of the involved gland was present, the mechanism of which was obscure. 
Comparison of tomographic and planar imaging for the evaluation of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction using pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with technetium-99m sestamibi. Pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (Tc-99m sestamibi) was performed in patients who underwent thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction comparing planar imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Twenty-one patients were injected with Tc-99m sestamibi before thrombolytic treatment. SPECT and planar imaging were acquired after completion of the treatment. The scintigraphy was repeated 5 days later in 20 subjects. Planar and SPECT studies were evaluated using an uptake score. Patients were divided according to the status of the infarct-related vessel (patent in 13 patients, group 1, and occluded in seven, group 2) and to the presence of functional recovery in serial echocardiographic controls (present in 10 patients, group A, and absent in 10, group B). The scintigraphic defect extent in the 5-day images correlated with the enzymatic infarct size: SPECT: r = 0.75, p less than 0.0002; planar: r = 0.68, p less than 0.002. The decrease of the uptake defects correlated with the reduction of the left ventricular wall asynergy (admission versus 1 month echocardiogram): SPECT: r = 0.92, p less than 0.000001; planar: r = 0.82, p less than 0.00001. The percent decrease of the uptake defects was significantly higher in patients in group 1 and group A compared with group 2 and, respectively, group B--SPECT: group 1: 51.4 +/- 27.7 versus group 2: 13.1 +/- 8.6, p less than 0.02; group A: 64.2 +/- 15.3 versus group B: 11.9 +/- 8.1, p less than 0.0002; planar group 1: 41 +/- 30.4 versus group 2: 7.7 +/- 6.2, p less than 0.05; group A: 52.5 +/- 24.3 versus group B: 6.1 +/- 6, p less than 0.0002. This study confirms the reliability of pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with Tc-99m sestamibi for evaluating the outcome of thrombolytic treatment in myocardial infarction. The results seems slightly more accurate using SPECT, but a simple three-view planar study also gives useful data. 
Extradural haematoma after continuous extradural anaesthesia. We report a case of extradural haematoma occurring after extradural anaesthesia in an anticoagulated patient. The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and the haematoma was evacuated surgically. A search of the literature revealed only five previous reports of extradural haematoma in association with extradural anaesthesia. 
Deficiencies in anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody measurement in myasthenia gravis. In a retrospective case note study of 86 patients with myasthenia gravis, 60 had an anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody assay performed by the regional immunology laboratory. Antibody was detected in 38% which compares with 66-93% in other series. Whilst the use of staphylococcal protein A to precipitate the antibody-receptor complex, rather than anti-human immunoglobulin, may be partly responsible for this low sensitivity, other methodological problems are likely to exist. It is suggested that this potentially critical assay becomes a subject for regular audit. 
Role of intraoperative ultrasound examination in patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. To determine its potential impact on perioperative surgical management intraoperative ultrasound examination (cross sectional imaging, colour flow mapping, pulsed and continuous wave Doppler) was used in 16 consecutive patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. Epicardial cross sectional imaging before bypass defined the precise intracardiac morphology in 15 of 16 patients. The preoperative morphological diagnosis was refined in four patients (25%), and this influenced surgical management in two (12%). Epicardial studies after bypass identified seven residual haemodynamic lesions in five patients (three residual intercardiac shunts, one ventricular outflow obstruction, one pulmonary artery obstruction, two mitral valve regurgitation), and led to immediate revision during a second period of bypass in three (18%). In one patient who required early reoperation residual shunting was not detected after bypass by either colour flow mapping or a contrast study. Final intraoperative studies showed a good surgical result in 14 patients (87%). Flow characteristics and flow velocities within the Fontan circulation could be assessed immediately after the patient came off cardiopulmonary bypass by means of combined pulsed wave Doppler and colour flow mapping in 14 of the 16 patients. Cross sectional studies of the left heart after bypass showed no change in ventricular function and allowed monitoring of volume replacement and ventricular filling. Intraoperative ultrasound was a valuable monitoring technique in patients undergoing a Fontan-type procedure. It refined preoperative diagnosis, monitored ventricular function, and identified or excluded residual haemodynamic lesions in most patients. 
Postoperative vasospasm after antegrade mesenteric revascularization: a report of three cases. Vascular reconstruction for chronic intestinal ischemia can be accomplished by endarterectomy or aortomesenteric bypass. In our practice, antegrade bypasses from the supraceliac aorta to the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery are currently the most frequently used techniques. Such reconstructions often use multiple or bifurcated large diameter vascular prostheses and have demonstrated excellent long-term patency. Despite these salutory results, we have noted an unusual perioperative response in three of these patients, which is the subject of this report. All three patients underwent uncomplicated elective mesenteric revascularization with grafts (diameter greater than or equal to 6 mm) originating in the supraceliac aorta. Indications for operation included (1) history of postprandial pain, (2) documentation of weight loss, and (3) angiographic evidence of advanced atherosclerotic disease with appropriate collateral development. Episodes of abdominal pain occurred 5 to 20 days after operation when normal food intake was reinstituted. In two patients immediate angiograms revealed patent grafts with diffuse mesenteric vasospasm. Treatment with intravenous hyperalimentation and nifedipine for 10 days resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. In the third patient, symptoms were totally relieved by temporary reduction in oral intake and administration of nifedipine. A later angiogram revealed a patent graft. All patients have remained asymptomatic and regained normal weight. This pattern of postrevascularization pain has not been seen in our patients undergoing revascularization with small (i.e., venous) conduits originating in the infrarenal aorta. The cause appears to be a heightened myogenic response of a "protected" vascular bed when suddenly exposed to the high perfusion pressure and blood flow of large caliber antegrade conduits. Prophylaxis with calcium channel blockers and use of smaller diameter grafts (5 mm) may avoid this disturbing syndrome. 
Hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The evolution of the present approach to the newborn with hypoplastic left heart is outlined. Preoperatively, maintenance of ductal patency with prostaglandin E1 and balancing of systemic and pulmonary blood flow are essential. Operative details of the first-stage palliation and the definitive second-stage procedure are described. The more recent adoption of an intermediate-stage hemi-Fontan procedure is also described. Since January 1989, 151 patients have been treated using this three-stage approach, with 109 early survivors. Seventy-eight have undergone the hemi-Fontan operation with nine deaths (5 of whom came to this stage early nonelectively because of shunt failure or ventricular dysfunction). Twenty-seven of the 78 patients undergoing hemi-Fontan operation have subsequently undergone definitive Fontan procedures with no deaths. 
Acute leukemia/lymphoma of plasmacytoid T-cell type. Plasmacytic morphologic characteristics are usually associated with cells of B-lymphocyte origin. Recently, plasmacytoid T-cells have been described in reactive lymph nodes and a rare form of lymphoma characteristically associated with myeloproliferative disorders. This report documents a case of plasmacytoid T-cell malignancy that initially presented as an acute leukemia in an elderly man with a longstanding myelodysplastic syndrome. The tumor replaced bone marrow and involved lymph nodes. Despite aggressive therapy, he died quickly of his leukemia/lymphoma. This case illustrates the need for complete cellular analysis in the diagnosis of morphologically plasmacytic malignancies and raises additional questions about the relationship of this peculiar type of T-cell to the hematopoietic marrow. 
Intracranial metastases from malignant pleural mesothelioma. Report of three autopsy cases and review of the literature. We report three cases of brain metastases from malignant pleural mesothelioma that were seen at autopsy. We present a summarized review of 15 similar reports that were previously published. Our study included three aged male patients with a long occupational history of heavy asbestos exposure. In two patients, the metastases were discovered incidentally at autopsy, and there were no neurologic symptoms referred to before death. In the other patient, who had clinically occult mesothelioma, the intracranial tumor was discovered ante mortem: in this patient, the clinical features, as well as a computed tomographic scan, suggested a primary tumor of the brain. Interestingly, the histologic features of the latter case that were seen at autopsy depicted a spindle cell tumor that focally exhibited pseudopalisading, necrosis, vascular buds, which deceptively recalled a glioblastoma. All the three cases shared a basic sarcomatous pattern of malignant pleural mesothelioma in both primary and metastatic tumors. The immunohistochemical profile was consistent with such interpretation. It was concluded that metastases to the brain from malignant pleural mesothelioma, although rare, are not exceptional even if their clinical relevance is not prominent. They are seen concomitantly with high-grade tumors, and by mimicking a primary tumor on a clinical, instrumental, and histologic ground, they may occasionally represent a potential source of diagnostic pitfall. 
Chronic beta-adrenoceptor blockade prevents the development of beta-adrenergic subsensitivity in experimental right-sided congestive heart failure in dogs. BACKGROUND. The reductions of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density and responsiveness to catecholamines in congestive heart failure are associated with excessive sympathetic stimulation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the myocardial changes could be prevented by beta-receptor blockade. METHODS AND RESULTS. We administered the oral beta-receptor blocking agent nadolol (40 mg/day) to dogs during an early stage of experimental right heart failure and to sham-operated dogs for 5 weeks. Animals receiving no nadolol were studied concurrently. Nadolol treatment did not prevent right ventricular hypertrophy or elevated concentrations of plasma norepinephrine that occurred in right heart failure, nor did it affect the decrease in myocardial norepinephrine content and norepinephrine uptake activity, suggesting that the hemodynamic stress imposed on the right ventricle of dogs with right heart failure was similar regardless of the presence or absence of beta-receptor blockade. Resting heart rate, right atrial pressure, aortic pressure, cardiac output, right ventricular dP/dt, and left ventricular dP/dt and dP/dt/P measured 5 days after discontinuation of nadolol did not differ significantly from those without nadolol treatment in either right heart failure or sham-operated animals. Sham-operated dogs also showed no changes in myocardial beta-receptor or adenylate cyclase activity after nadolol treatment. However, nadolol treatment prevented the reduction of myocardial beta-receptor density and attenuated the decrease in the cardiac beta-adrenergic sensitivity that occurred in right heart failure. CONCLUSIONS. Excessive sympathetic stimulation may play an important role in the development of beta-receptor downregulation and beta-adrenergic subsensitivity in right heart failure. 
Oval cell proliferation and the origin of small hepatocytes in liver injury induced by D-galactosamine. Oval cells may function as facultative liver stem cells and tumor progenitors in liver carcinogenesis. The authors determined whether oval cells proliferate and if small hepatocytes might be generated from epithelial cell progenitors in noncarcinogenic liver injury. The authors found that oval cells similar to those detected in early carcinogenesis proliferate in response to D-galactosamine (GaIN). Oval cells expressed gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase activity, bile duct-type cytokeratins and peanut agglutinin binding. Two unusual types of hepatocytes also appeared after injury: small hepatocytes (less than or equal to 16 microns in diameter) and hepatocytes lining atypical ductlike structures. In situ hybridization studies showed that the fetal form of alphafetoprotein mRNA was expressed by many oval cells, some bile duct cells, and occasional hepatocytes. By following the fate of epithelial cells labeled early after GaIN administration, the authors conclude that duct cells can generate both oval cells and small hepatocytes in response to GaIN. 
Protection from rotavirus reinfection: 2-year prospective study. To measure protection induced by natural rotavirus infection, 163 infants enrolled in a rotavirus vaccine trial were prospectively followed for 2 years. Serotype 1 rotaviruses were the predominant circulating strains during the study. Over the 2 years of observation, significantly fewer infants infected before enrollment developed a symptomatic reinfection (0 of 21) or any reinfection (4 of 21) compared with previously uninfected infants (P = .0003). Of the 60 infants who developed a primary rotavirus infection in the first year (40 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic) only 4 were reinfected in the second year compared with 29 of 82 subjects not previously infected (P = .00003). Asymptomatic primary infection appeared to be as protective as symptomatic primary infection. The only symptomatic reinfections occurred in 2 subjects who did not develop rotavirus antibody after the initial detection of rotavirus. An age-related reduction in the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic primary rotavirus infection was also detected. In this study, protection against homotypic serotype 1 reinfection appeared to last greater than or equal to 2 years. 
A 50-year follow-up of childhood plumbism. Hypertension, renal function, and hemoglobin levels among survivors. A group of 192 subjects with well-documented lead poisoning in 1930 to 1942 were identified in this pilot study. Thirty-five of 72 survivors traced to a Boston area address and 22 age-, sex-, race-, and neighborhood-matched controls were recruited into a clinical study. One matched subject with plumbism had grossly abnormal renal function and an elevated blood lead level of an unclear cause. Among the remaining 21 matched pairs, the risk of hypertension was significantly higher in subjects with plumbism (relative risk, 7.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 42.3). Mean adjusted creatinine clearance rates for subjects with plumbism, however, were significantly higher than those of controls and supranormal in comparison to rates predicted for sex and age. Subjects with plumbism had significantly lower hemoglobin concentrations and hematocrit readings than the controls. Blood lead and serum creatinine levels were low for both groups. These results suggest that survivors of childhood lead poisoning have an increased risk of clinically significant hypertension developing in the setting of supranormal creatinine clearance rates. 
Dilatation of ascending aorta in patients with repaired coarctation. The long-term outcome following repair of typical aortic coarctation in adulthood may be complicated by disorders of the ascending aorta. Follow-up averaging 15 years revealed a 3.8% incidence of dilatation of the ascending aorta after such late repair. Hypertension and concomitant aortic valvular disease were common in these patients. Aortic dilatation can appear years after coarctation repair, irrespective of the operative technique and its success, and can lead to death from aortic dissection or rupture of an aortic aneurysm. Careful follow-up after coarctation repair in adulthood is advisable to detect late aortic complications. 
Ifosfamide plus etoposide combined with regional hyperthermia in patients with locally advanced sarcomas: a phase II study. From July 1986 to July 1989, 40 patients (92% pretreated) with deep-seated, advanced soft tissue sarcomas (STS, 25 patients), Ewing's sarcomas (ES, eight patients), osteosarcomas (OS, three patients) and chondrosarcomas (ChS, four patients) were treated at the University of Munich in a protocol involving regional hyperthermia (RHT) combined with ifosfamide plus etoposide. A total of 265 RHT treatments (mean, 6.6 RHT per patient) were applied including 33 pelvic, four extremity, and three abdominal sites. The mean tumor volume was 537 cc (range, 50 to 2,980 cc). For systemic chemotherapy, all patients received ifosfamide (1.5 g/m2, days 1 to 5), etoposide (100 mg/m2, days 1, 3, and 5), and mesna (300 mg/m2 x 4, days 1 to 5) with RHT given only on days 1 and 5 in repeated cycles every 4 weeks. Acute toxicity consisted primarily of pain (57%) combined with local discomfort within the annular phased array applicator (AA) of the BSD hyperthermia system (BSD Medical Corp, Salt Lake City, UT). The average maximum systemic temperature was 37.4 +/- 0.5 degrees C, and there was no indication of enhanced bone marrow toxicity due to the addition of RHT to the systemic chemotherapy. Detailed thermal mapping by invasive thermometry was performed in all patients. In 38 assessable patients, the overall objective response rate was 37%: six complete responses (CRs), four partial responses (PRs), and four favorable histologic responses (FHRs) (95% confidence limits, 22% to 54%). Complete responders are alive and disease-free at 40, 35, 23, 19, 19, and 8 months. Of patients with PR and FHR, two died from metastatic disease after 4 and 17 months and one died from other disease after 27 months. The remaining five patients are stable at 37, 25, 21, 13, and 8 months. Eleven patients showed no change (NC), and 13 patients showed local tumor progression (PD). The mean observation time for all patients was 11.6 months. The time-averaged temperatures (Ts) of all RHT treatments calculated as 20% (T20), 50% (T50), or 90% (T90) of measured tumor sites differed significantly between responders and nonresponders (T20, P = .003; T50, P = .006; and T90, P = .004; respectively). These data support activity for ifosfamide-etoposide combined with RHT in pretreated patients with advanced sarcomas. 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the causative agent for pneumonia in the immunocompromised host. A young man undergoing chemotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma presented with fever, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a new infiltrate on the chest roentgenogram. Routine cultures and cytopathologic examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid provided no evidence for an etiology; however, special cultures of the BAL fluid demonstrated heavy growth of Mycoplasma pneumoniae. We recommend that evaluation of pneumonia in the immuno-compromised host include appropriate cultures of BAL fluid for M pneumoniae, particularly when the patient is 5 to 25 years old, the age of high incidence of mycoplasmal pneumonia. 
Frontal sinus carcinoma presenting as acute sinusitis. Primary carcinoma of the frontal sinus is extremely rare. The aetiology of the tumour remains obscure, and even with rapid diagnosis and radical surgery the prognosis remains very poor. 
Clinical significance of a dizziness history in medical patients with syncope. To determine the implications of dizziness as a symptom in patients with syncope, we analyzed responses to a standardized battery of questions about dizziness in 121 consecutive patients referred for evaluation of syncope. Associations were sought between final diagnosis (dependent variable) and clinical predictor variables. Dizziness was found in 70% of the patients with syncope. Dizzy patients were younger (mean ages, 47 vs 56 years, respectively), more often female (75% vs 42%), and more likely to be assigned a psychiatric diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified young age and rotatory dizziness (vertigo) to be associated with a psychiatric diagnosis. Dizziness and syncope frequently coexist and in many cases may represent the same pathophysiologic process. A careful dizziness history may guide the initial evaluation of syncope patients in clinical practice. 
Attenuation of IL-2-induced multisystem organ edema by phalloidin and antamanide. Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is a potent cytokine with diverse effects, including the ability to stimulate lymphocyte differentiation into cells capable of lysing tumor. Its therapeutic efficacy is limited because of side effects such as breakdown of the microvascular barrier and edema. Control of the microvascular barrier is in part regulated by endothelial cell cytoskeletal contractile proteins. This study tests whether the cyclopeptides that maintain actin filament organization and distribution and reduce macromolecular flux across the endothelial cell junction in vitro would similarly maintain barrier tightness and prevent early edema produced by IL-2 in vivo. Anesthetized rats were treated at 30-min periods with intravenous saline (0.5 ml, n = 41), phalloidin (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), or antamanide, (20 micrograms in 0.5 ml, n = 21), starting 30 min before the 1-h infusion of 10(6) U of recombinant human IL-2 or saline. Six hours after the start of IL-2, there was edema in the saline/IL-2 group, as measured by increased wet-to-dry ratios (W/D) in the lungs, heart, and kidney. With saline/IL-2, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid contained an elevated protein concentration and higher plasma thromboxane levels compared with controls. The number of neutrophils sequestered in the lungs was more than twice that of saline controls. Phalloidin significantly attenuated edema in lung and reduced BAL protein leak. Antamanide treatment was as effective in limiting lung and heart edema, but, in contrast to phalloidin, antamanide prevented kidney edema and did not lead to an alteration in the liver W/D. Antamanide also prevented BAL fluid protein leak. 
Current treatment for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: results and surgical implications. From July 1986 to January 1991, 123 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent operation for ablation of aberrant conduction pathways. There were 85 male and 38 female patients ranging in age from 11 months to 68 years. Associated anomalies included Ebstein's anomaly, sudden death syndrome, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, abdominal aortic aneurysm, neurofibromatosis, other arrhythmias, or other complex congenital heart disease. Forty-one patients had multiple accessory pathways. Operative results showed a 7% initial failure rate, which dropped to 3% after reoperation. One patient had undergone previous operation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome at another institution. Procedures performed concomitantly included mitral or tricuspid valve repair or replacement (6), right ventricular conduit replacement, subaortic resection, Fontan repair, corrected transposition repair, coronary artery bypass, and placement of an automatic internal cardioverter defibrillator. There was no operative mortality. Late follow-up is 27 +/- 16 months, and complications included mitral regurgitation and myocardial infarction. By comparison, in the last 12 months 124 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent catheter ablation using radiofrequency current. There were 9 patients with multiple pathways. One hundred twelve patients (90%) had all accessory atrioventricular connections ablated and have remained free of symptomatic tachycardia. There have been 12 failures (10%), of which 5 have had operation and 7 are being treated medically. Mean follow-up is 7 +/- 5 months, and complications included circumflex coronary artery occlusion, excessive bleeding, valve perforation, and cerebral vascular accident. 
Intermittent ischemia potentiates intestinal reperfusion injury. We hypothesized that even brief periods of reperfusion interjected between ischemic episodes would increase tissue injury. Studies were performed in a rat small intestine preparation in which metabolic, hemodynamic, and histologic responses to ischemia have been well characterized. Animals were subjected to a total of 30 or 45 minutes of complete intestinal ischemia. Flow interruption was continuous (C, single episode) or intermittent (I, two or three episodes of 15-minute ischemia separated by 5 minutes of reperfusion). In some experiments 5-minute reperfusions were performed with arterial blood depleted of leukocytes (IL). This additional perturbation was included to determine the role of neutrophils that have been strongly implicated in reperfusion injury. In all three protocols histologic sections were obtained after each ischemic insult and after 1 hour of reperfusion with arterial blood. Villous histology was graded in a blinded fashion with 1 = normal and 5 = severe injury. No significant differences were found between groups in immediate postischemic histologies before reperfusion. After 1 hour of reperfusion, intermittent episodes of ischemia were associated with significantly worse histologic injury than that seen with comparable durations of continuous ischemia (30 min: I, 4.4 +/- 0.5 vs C, 2.7 +/- 0.4; 45 min: I, 4.9 +/- 0.2 vs C, 2.8 +/- 0.3). However, if 5-minute reperfusions were with leukopenic blood, this effect was markedly reduced (30 min IL, 3.4 +/- 0.3; 45 min IL, 3.6 +/- 0.2). Even short periods of reperfusion during an ischemic insult greatly increased mucosal injury. 
Combination antihypertensive therapy with terazosin and other antihypertensive agents: results of clinical trials. Clinical trials in which the selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor blocker terazosin was given in combination with other antihypertensive agents are reviewed. Results of a recent study examining the effects of combination terazosin and verapamil therapy on blood pressure and heart rate are also presented. In several studies of the combination of terazosin plus a diuretic (hydrochlorothiazide, methyclothiazide, chlorthalidone, furosemide, amiloride, triamterene, metolazone, or spironolactone), significant decreases in one or more of the blood pressure variables studied were demonstrated (compared with diuretic plus placebo). In a placebo-controlled, double-blind study of terazosin plus atenolol, supine and standing blood pressures decreased significantly from baseline (atenolol monotherapy) after the addition of terazosin but not placebo. In a study of terazosin added to background therapy (including beta-blockers, diuretics, methyldopa, clonidine, captopril, guanethidine, hydralazine, and nifedipine), the addition of terazosin resulted in significant decreases in supine and standing diastolic blood pressures compared with baseline values (background therapy alone). Combination antihypertensive therapy with terazosin and verapamil reduced blood pressure to a significantly greater extent than either agent alone. Preliminary pharmacokinetic results indicate that terazosin did not alter the metabolism of verapamil. No significant abnormal laboratory test results have been reported for patients taking terazosin in combination with other antihypertensive agents; in fact some evidence suggests that terazosin may attenuate adverse lipid, glucose, and potassium changes associated with thiazide diuretics. Adverse experiences associated with terazosin combination therapy are usually mild to moderate. Results from all these studies suggest that terazosin effectively controls mild-to-moderate hypertension when it is used in combination with other antihypertensive agents without cumulative adverse effects. 
Repressor to activator switch by mutations in the first Zn finger of the glucocorticoid receptor: is direct DNA binding necessary? Transfection of HeLa cells with cDNA vectors expressing the wild-type human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) enabled dexamethasone to strongly repress cytokine- and second messenger-induced expression of cotransfected chimeric reporter genes containing transcription regulatory DNA elements from the human interleukin 6 (IL-6) promoter. Deletion of the DNA-binding domain or of the second Zn finger or a point mutation in the Zn catenation site in the second finger blocked the ability of GR to mediate repression of the IL-6 promoter. Unexpectedly, deletion of the first Zn finger, a point mutation in the Zn-catenation site in the first finger, or one in the steroid-specificity domain at the base of the first finger converted GR into a dexamethasone-responsive activator that enhanced basal and interleukin 1-induced IL-6 promoter function. These first-finger mutants of GR also mediated dexamethasone-responsive enhancement of expression of the herpesvirus thymidine kinase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (TK-105-CAT and TK-80-CAT) reporter genes but not of the murine mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat-CAT or the c-fos-CAT (pFC700) reporter genes. Wild-type GR was able to specifically bind to DNA fragments containing glucocorticoid response element sequences in both the murine mammary tumor virus and IL-6 promoters, albeit weakly to the latter, in a sequential DNA-binding immunoprecipitation assay. The first-finger mutants of GR, however, were inactive in this assay. Thus, mutations in the first Zn finger unmask unusual promoter-specific activation properties of GR that may not require direct high-affinity binding of the mutant GR to target DNA. 
Radiation exposure of pediatric patients and physicians during cardiac catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Thermoluminescent dosimeters were applied to various areas of 61 pediatric patients and physicians to measure radiation doses during routine cardiac catheterization and during 4 cases of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty. Radiation doses were measured during chest roentgenography, fluoroscopy and cineangiography. Average skin dose to the chest was 121 microGy during chest x-ray, 5,182 microGy during catheterization and 641 mGy during valvuloplasty. For the eyes, thyroid and gonads of the patients, the exposure during routine catheterization was equal to 0.4, 6 and 0.2 chest x-rays, respectively. Radiation dose of the operator was 3 microGy for the eyes and 6 miCroGy in the thyroid. About 56% of the operator's dose could be reduced by thyroid shields, and 80% by lead aprons. The assistant received only 1 microGy outside the thyroid shield. Therefore, we have concluded that the patients' dose during routine catheterization is largely based on our experimental results, but the dose is acceptable based on the risk factor analysis. The skin dose to the right lateral chest of the patient during valvuloplasty is extremely high, perhaps as high as the equivalent of 1,000 chest x-rays. Besides the clinical benefits of valvuloplasty, the long-term radiation-related hazards to the patient should be carefully monitored. 
Variables controlling the secretion of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 in normal human subjects. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-2 (IGFBP-2) is one of a family of IGFBPs that are present in extracellular fluids, and binds both IGF-II and IGF-I with high affinity. These studies were conducted to determine the nutritional and hormonal variables that regulate plasma IGFBP-2 concentrations in humans. The mean plasma IGFBP-2 concentration for 38 normal adult subjects was 150 +/- 61 micrograms/L and was 4.7-fold greater than their mean fasting IGFBP-1 value. Mean IGFBP-2 values in cord sera of 26 normal term infants was 3.8-fold greater than the normal adult mean value. Likewise, the mean value for 44 hypopituitary adults was increased 2-fold compared to normal. There was no suppression of IGFBP-2 values in acromegaly. Normal adult subjects showed minimal fluctuations (less than 2-fold changes) in plasma IGFBP-2 concentrations during a 48-h sampling period. These changes were significantly less than the changes that occurred in plasma IGFBP-1 during the same interval. Plasma IGFBP-2 did not change significantly post prandially or after a glucose infusion. Extreme insulin deficiency, after 9 days of fasting, was associated with a 1.7-fold increase in plasma IGFBP-2. Administration of GH, which is known to cause a major decrease in plasma IGFBP-1 and in IGFBP-2 in hypophysectomized animals, did not result in a change in calorically restricted normal adult subjects, suggesting that a normal caloric intake is required for GH to suppress IGFBP-2. In summary, these results show that plasma IGFBP-2 is regulated differently than IGFBP-1. Acute stimulation of insulin secretion does not suppress IGFBP-2, and there is much less daily fluctuation compared to IGFBP-1. These findings suggest that plasma IGFBP-2 levels are more stable than IGFBP-1, and therefore IGFBP-2 may serve as a larger reservior that is available for IGF transport. 
Infarction in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. A case report. An unusual case of focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver with infarction is presented. The patient, a 16-year-old girl with a three-year history of oral contraceptive use, presented with a two-week history of intermittent abdominal pain. Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver and the role of estrogens in the development of this lesion are discussed. 
Solitary pulmonary nodule: high-resolution CT and radiologic-pathologic correlation. Edge and internal characteristics of pulmonary nodules evaluated with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) were correlated with the pathologic specimens in 93 patients. Speculation correlated pathologically with irregular fibrosis, localized lymphatic spread of tumor, or an infiltrative tumor growth pattern and was observed in six of 11 benign nodules (55%) and 74 of 85 malignant nodules (87%). Pleural tags were observed in three benign nodules (27%) and 49 malignant lesions (58%); pathologically, these represented fibrotic bands usually associated with juxta-cicatricial pleural retraction. Bubblelike areas of low attenuation within the nodule were observed in 21 malignant lesions (25%) and only one benign nodule (9%). They were observed most commonly in bronchioloalveolar carcinomas (seven of 14) and were due either to patent small bronchi or small, cystic spaces within neoplastic glands. Malignant nodules as a group were larger than benign lesions (P = .02) and more commonly demonstrated a spiculated contour (P less than .05), lobulation (P less than .001), and inhomogeneous attenuation (P less than .05). 
The association of bullous pemphigoid and malignant disease: a case control study. In a case control study, the incidence of malignant disease in 84 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) was compared with 168 controls. The rate of malignant disease (past, concurrent or during follow-up) in BP patients was 17.9% compared to 5.3% in the controls. A number of the malignancies occurring in the BP group may be of doubtful significance, being either temporally very remote or partially attributable to treatment. The rate of concurrent BP and malignancy (within 8 weeks) was 6.0% suggesting that there is probably a slight excess of malignancy in BP, but insufficient to warrant extensive investigation in pursuit of cancer. Comparison of the BP patients with and without cancer identified no clinical or immunopathological subgroups in whom investigations would be indicated. Three patients with both BP and malignancy were HLA-DR 13 positive, which may point to an immunogenetic predisposition to both diseases. 
Oxygen transport during steady-state submaximal exercise in chronic hypoxia. Arterial O2 delivery during short-term submaximal exercise falls on arrival at high altitude but thereafter remains constant. As arterial O2 content increases with acclimatization, blood flow falls. We evaluated several factors that could influence O2 delivery during more prolonged submaximal exercise after acclimatization at 4,300 m. Seven men (23 +/- 2 yr) performed 45 min of steady-state submaximal exercise at sea level (barometric pressure 751 Torr), on acute ascent to 4,300 m (barometric pressure 463 Torr), and after 21 days of residence at altitude. The O2 uptake (VO2) was constant during exercise, 51 +/- 1% of maximal VO2 at sea level, and 65 +/- 2% VO2 at 4,300 m. After acclimatization, exercise cardiac output decreased 25 +/- 3% compared with arrival and leg blood flow decreased 18 +/- 3% (P less than 0.05), with no change in the percentage of cardiac output to the leg. Hemoglobin concentration and arterial O2 saturation increased, but total body and leg O2 delivery remained unchanged. After acclimatization, a reduction in plasma volume was offset by an increase in erythrocyte volume, and total blood volume did not change. Mean systemic arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and leg vascular resistance were all greater after acclimatization (P less than 0.05). Mean plasma norepinephrine levels also increased during exercise in a parallel fashion with increased vascular resistance. Thus we conclude that both total body and leg O2 delivery decrease after arrival at 4,300 m and remain unchanged with acclimatization as a result of a parallel fall in both cardiac output and leg blood flow and an increase in arterial O2 content. 
Positron emission tomography for the assessment of myocardial viability. The detection of viable myocardium or ischemically injured myocardium with a reversible impairment of contractile function remains clinically important but challenging. Detection of reversible dysfunction and distinction from irreversible tissue injury by positron emission tomography is based on identification of preserved or even enhanced glucose metabolism with F-18 2-fluoro 2-deoxyglucose. Regional patterns of myocardial glucose utilization and blood flow, defined as perfusion-metabolism mismatches or matches, on positron emission tomography in patients with chronic or even acute ischemic heart disease are highly accurate in predicting the functional outcome after interventional revascularization. Compared with thallium-201 redistribution scintigraphy, positron emission tomography appears to be diagnostically more accurate, especially in patients with severely impaired left ventricular function. While larger clinical trials are needed for further confirmation, positron emission tomography has already proved clinically useful for stratifying patients with poor left ventricular function to the most appropriate therapeutic approach. 
Treatment of peptic ulcer disease with sucralfate: a review. Sucralfate has been used widely for the treatment of peptic ulcer. Healing rates for duodenal ulcer range from 60 to 90% at 4-6 weeks and up to 90% at 12 weeks for gastric ulcer. The small number of maintenance trials suggest that relapse of duodenal ulcer is reduced comparably to H2 receptor antagonists. There has been considerable interest in the possibility of lower relapse ratios after initial healing with sucralfate compared with H2 receptor antagonists, but more studies of the possible mechanisms as well as larger trials are still needed to confirm these observations. 
Enzymic control of the expression of the X determinant (CD15) in human myeloid cells during maturation: the regulatory role of 6-sialytransferase. To establish the basis for the reduced expression of the X determinant on leukemic blasts and the changes in antigenic expression that occur during myeloid maturation, the presence on myeloid cells of X and related structures was examined in conjunction with studies on the activities of the glycosyltransferases involved in their biosynthesis. Expression of X and sialyl-X was weak on blasts in comparison with neutrophils despite the presence of the requisite precursor structures. Much higher levels of 3-fucosyltransferase activity were found in blasts than in neutrophils when nonsialylated substrates were used, but, whereas the enzyme in neutrophils reacted equally well with 3'-sialylated and nonsialylated acceptors, the enzyme in blasts showed a marked preference for nonsialylated substrates. 6'-Sialyltransferase activity was strong in blasts but was not detectable in neutrophils, whereas a much lower level of 3'-sialyltransferase activity was present in both blasts and neutrophils. Dimethyl sulfoxide-induced maturation of HL60 cells was associated with (1) a decrease in both 6'-sialyltransferase and 3-fucosyltransferase activities, (2) a change in the substrate specificity of 3-fucosyltransferase towards that found in mature cells, and (3) increased cell surface expression of sialyl-X. These results suggest that the reduced expression of X in myeloblasts is related to the presence of the strong 6'-sialyltransferase, which uses the precursor substrate at the expense of the 3-fucosyltransferase and prevents the synthesis of X and sialyl-X. The developmental regulation of the levels of 3'- and 6'-sialyltransferases, and the level and specificity of the 3-fucosyltransferases, therefore controls the expression of X and its degree of sialylation. 
Vitamin B6 and valproic acid in treatment of infantile spasms. Twenty patients with infantile spasms were treated with high doses of vitamin b6, valproic acid, or both. Three of 13 patients (23%) treated initially with high doses of vitamin B6 demonstrated a definite reduction in seizures; 2 patients had no improvement on electroencephalography. Vitamin B6 therapy alone was continued in a single patient (8%) who remained seizure-free during the 15-month follow-up period. Initial treatment with vitamin B6 and valproic acid improved the electroencephalogram significantly more (P less than 0.05) than initial vitamin B6 treatment alone. The group which had valproic acid added to vitamin B6 therapy had significantly fewer seizures (P less than 0.05) and better electroencephalograms (P less than 0.01) than did the group treated initially with vitamin B6 alone. There were no significant differences among the group treated initially with vitamin B6, the group treated initially with valproic acid, and the group in which valproic acid was substituted for vitamin B6. ACTH was more effective in abolishing seizures than was valproic acid or vitamin B6 and valproic acid. ACTH had an excellent effect on seizures in 86% of patients who did not respond well to vitamin B6, valproic acid, or both; however, many of these patients had later recurrence of infantile spasms. The combination of vitamin B6 and valproic acid is effective and safe in the treatment of infantile spasms. 
Natural history and prognostic variables in primary sclerosing cholangitis. The clinical features at the time of presentation and the outcome in 126 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis were studied to clarify the natural history and prognosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The median age of the patients at the time of presentation was 36 years, 62% were male, and 16% were asymptomatic. The median follow-up from time of presentation was 5.8 years. There were more patients who had liver transplants (21%) than patients who died of liver-related disease (16%); the estimated median survival to these end points was 12 years. Cholangiocarcinoma was found in 8 patients and in 23% of those undergoing liver transplantation. Asymptomatic patients had milder disease than symptomatic patients, but in a univariate analysis the presence of symptoms was not prognostically significant. On multivariate analysis, the following independent prognostic factors were found: hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, serum alkaline phosphatase, histological stage, and age. These features were combined to produce a prognostic model that should be valuable in the stratification of patients in clinical trials and in the timing of liver transplantation, particularly in those patients seen soon after presentation. 
Intensive therapy for small-cell lung cancer using carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, mid-cycle vincristine, and radiotherapy. Forty patients with small-cell lung cancer (31 patients with limited-stage [LS] disease, and nine patients with extensive-stage [ES] disease but of good performance status) have been treated with an intensive therapy composed of carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide with vincristine on day 14 of each carboplatin cycle. A maximum of six cycles were administered at 3 weekly intervals after the cisplatin combination and 4 weekly after the carboplatin combination. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was given with the first cycle of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation with the third cycle. The median nadir for neutrophils was 0.47 x 10(9)/L and for platelets, 40 x 10(9)/L. Chemotherapy dosages were not reduced in response to myelosuppression, but treatment was delayed to allow blood count recovery. Sixty-eight percent of patients received all six cycles of chemotherapy, and there were four deaths associated with treatment-related neutropenia. Twenty-eight patients (70%) achieved a complete response (CR) when assessed 1 month after the end of treatment, and a further five patients (12.5%) had a partial response (PR). Median duration of CR was 16 months and of PR, 8 months. Cerebral metastases occurred in 20% of all patients and was the apparent sole site of relapse in 11% of the CR patients. The median survival of the total group was 14 months with an actual 2-year survival of 30% and a minimum follow-up of 28 months. 
Cervical bruits: clinical correlates of stenosis. To analyze the relationship among characteristics of buits, degree of underlying stenosis, and neurologic symptom complexes, the authors studied 157 patients with bruits undergoing digital subtraction angiography. Symptom status assignment (definite lateralizing, possible lateralizing, vertebrobasilar, diffuse, and asymptomatic) and cervical auscultation for location, duration, and other bruit characteristics were performed independently. Bruit occurrence was associated with stenosis of greater than or equal to 50% of the underlying vessel with the association being no stronger at higher levels of stenosis (greater than or equal to 80%). No relationship existed between the side of bruit and side of symptoms in those with lateralized symptoms. The authors found more severe degrees of carotid stenosis in two symptomatic groups (vertebrobasilar insufficiency [VBI] and definite lateralized) compared with asymptomatic patients. Those with VBI had more high-grade stenosis, whereas those with lateralized symptoms had more occlusions, which tended to be ipsilateral to the symptoms. 
Complement activation during bypass in acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Serial complement estimations during cardiopulmonary bypass are reported in a patient with acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency. Although the extent of classic and alternative pathway activation appeared appropriate, exaggerated common pathway activation with massive increase in the C3d:C3 ratio occurred. A fatal hemostatic disorder, pulmonary edema, and circulatory collapse ensued despite prophylaxis and therapy. 
Myeloablative combination chemotherapy without total body irradiation for neuroblastoma. Myeloablative treatment intensification in 25 patients diagnosed when older than 12 months of age with stage IV neuroblastoma included sequential delivery of cisplatin 120 mg/m2 x 1, hyperfractionated radiation (2,100 cGy) to the primary site and adjacent lymph nodes, carmustine (BCNU) 200 mg/m2 x 1, melphalan 60 mg/m2/d x 3 (n = 13) or thiotepa 300 mg/m2/d x 3. (n = 12), and etoposide (VP 16) 300 mg/m2/d x 3. Seventy-two hours after the last dose of VP 16, histologically tumor-free and 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC; 100 mumol/L)-purged autologous bone marrow (ABMT) was infused. Acute toxicities included grade 3 to 4 oral mucositis, grade 1 to 2 diarrhea, and fevers. No patient required infusion of unpurged reserve autografts. At ABMT, 16 patients (group I) were progression-free 6.5 months to 14 months (median, 9 months) from diagnosis: seven remain progression-free 20 months to 46 months (median, 39 months) off therapy, six relapsed 4 months to 17 months post-ABMT, and three died of toxicity (candidiasis, metabolic derangement, and venoocclusive disease [VOD]). The event-free survival of group I patients is 44% at 24 months post-ABMT. Nine patients (group II) were in second remission at ABMT, including three who had relapsed after other transplant procedures: two are progression-free 24 months and 41 months off therapy, four relapsed 3 months to 12 months post-ABMT, and three died of toxicity (aspergillosis, hemorrhagic cystitis, VOD). Only one of 10 relapses involved a primary site, suggesting a beneficial effect of local radiation. In terms of survival or toxicity, an advantage for melphalan or thiotepa was not evident. Regimens such as this may prolong the survival of selected patients with poor-risk neuroblastoma, but concerns over late relapses and toxicity mandate continuing efforts to devise alternative, less risky, and more clearly beneficial approaches for definitive ablation of neuroblastoma. 
Enalapril prevents cardiac fibrosis and arrhythmias in hypertensive rats. To evaluate the effects of hypertension on cardiac hypertrophy, on myocardial structure, and on ventricular arrhythmias, 27 3-month-old spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with enalapril (10 mg/kg) daily for 11 months and compared with 26 untreated control rats. Systolic arterial pressure was significantly decreased in treated rats, and at the end of the experiment, it was 199 +/- 3 mm Hg (treated) versus 237 +/- 3 mm Hg (controls) (p less than 0.001). At this time, spontaneous arrhythmias and induced arrhythmias either by programmed electrical stimulation (train of stimuli +1 or 2 extrastimuli) or by trains of eight stimuli at decreasing coupling intervals were observed in isolated heart preparations. Comparing enalapril-treated and control rats, spontaneous arrhythmias (9 of 27 versus 20 of 26, respectively; p less than 0.01), programmed stimulation-induced arrhythmias (3 of 26 versus 12 of 23, respectively; p less than 0.01), and trains of stimuli-induced arrhythmias (4 of 26 versus 14 of 19, respectively, p less than 0.001) were less frequent in the enalapril group. Left ventricular weight was decreased in treated rats by 18% (p less than 0.001). Enalapril administration diminished the fraction of myocardium occupied by foci of replacement fibrosis normally occurring in control rats by 59% (p less than 0.001). Finally, a significant correlation was found between left ventricular weight, the extent of myocardial fibrosis, and the occurrence of ventricular fibrillation. It was concluded that chronic treatment with enalapril, which resulted in attenuation of systemic arterial pressure by limiting cardiac hypertrophy and myocardial fibrosis, decreases the propensity of the heart of hypertensive rats to arrhythmogenesis. 
Bilateral carcinoma of the external auditory meatus. A 65-year-old woman had suffered for two months from bilateral tinnitus and discharge, pain in the right ear, and loss of hearing. Biopsy showed carcinoma of the squamous type on both sides. Tomography revealed bone destruction on the right. The patient was treated with radiotherapy. Two months after treatment, tomography showed tumour regression on the right side, but progression on the left. The literature on this subject is reviewed. 
Can computer aided teaching packages improve clinical care in patients with acute abdominal pain? OBJECTIVE--To compare three methods of support for inexperienced staff in their diagnosis and management of patients with acute abdominal pain--namely, with (a) structured data collection forms, (b) real time computer aided decision support, and (c) computer based teaching packages. DESIGN--Prospective assessment of effects of methods of support on groups of doctors in one urban hospital and one rural hospital. SETTING--Accident and emergency department at Whipps Cross Hospital, London, and surgical wards of Airedale General Hospital, West Yorkshire. PATIENTS--Consecutive prospective series of all patients presenting to each hospital in specified time periods with acute abdominal pain; total patients in the various periods were 12,506. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Diagnostic accuracy of participating doctors, admission rates of patients with non-specific abdominal pain, perforation rates in patients with appendicitis, negative laparotomy rates. RESULTS--Use of any one modality resulted in improved diagnostic accuracy and decision making performance. Use of structured forms plus computer feedback resulted in better performance than use of forms alone. Use of structured forms plus a computer teaching package gave results at least as good as those with direct feedback by computer. CONCLUSIONS--The results confirm earlier studies in suggesting that the use of computer aided decision support improves diagnostic and decision making performance when dealing with patients suffering from acute abdominal pain. That use of the computer for teaching gave results at least as good as with its use for direct feedback may be highly relevant for those who are apprehensive about the real time use of diagnostic computers in a clinical setting. 
Differential pathophysiology of bacterial translocation after thermal injury and sepsis. Bacterial translocation (BT) occurs transiently after thermal injury and may result from an ischemic intestinal insult. To evaluate continued intestinal ischemia in the ongoing BT associated with sepsis after injury, rats were randomized to (1) 30% burn injury with Pseudomonas wound infection (BI), (2) BI + fluid resuscitation (BI + Fluid), (3) BI after allopurinol pretreatment to inhibit xanthine oxidase (BI + Allo), or (4) BI after azapropazone pretreatment to inhibit neutrophil degranulation (BI + Aza). On postburn days (PBD) 1, 4, and 7, animals were studied for evidence of BT and intestinal lipid peroxidation. BI + Fluid, BI + Allo, and BI + Aza significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced rates of BT and ileal lipid peroxidation acutely after thermal injury (PBD 1) compared to BI. All four groups had equally high rates of BT associated with the onset of sepsis (PBDs 4 and 7), without evidence of further intestinal lipid peroxidation. These data indicate that the chronic gut barrier failure associated with sepsis after injury occurs independently of continued intestinal ischemia. 
Stroke in a young adult with Fletcher trait. We have reported the case of a young woman with prekallikrein deficiency who had a cerebral infarction despite a prolonged APTT. She had bleeding complications with heparin administration. From the limited information in the literature, anticoagulation may be hazardous in these patients, and it should be undertaken with caution. 
Efficacy and safety considerations in women with uterine leiomyomas treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists: the estrogen threshold hypothesis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists induce a reversible hypogonadotropic hypogonadal environment. Leiomyomas are common, estrogen-sensitive, benign neoplasms that decrease in size by 40% to 50% during gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment. During gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy most women are amenorrheic. After discontinuation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist treatment, uterine and myoma size increase and a return to pretreatment menstrual patterns often occurs. Concerns about the safety of long-term hypoestrogenism have made long-term gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist administration an undesirable treatment strategy. This article focuses on the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists as preoperative therapy in selected women undergoing hysterectomy or myomectomy and the combination of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist with estrogen-progestin "add-back" treatment as a potential long-term medical therapy for women with symptomatic leiomyomas. Finally, an estrogen threshold hypothesis to assess the effects of circulating estrogen concentrations on different tissues, is presented. 
Globus pharyngeus: long-term follow-up and prognostic factors. A prospective trial of 80 patients with globus pharyngeus is reported. An in-depth analysis of the typical history at presentation is given. The average follow-up period was 27 months (range, 21 to 42 months). The asymptomatic rate at this interval was 25%, with a further 35% reporting a significant improvement in symptoms. Three independent factors were found to influence prognosis (p less than .05). These were sex, length of history at consultation, and the presence or absence of associated throat symptoms. Male patients having a history of the globus symptom for less than 3 months and not complaining of any associated throat symptoms had the best chance of becoming asymptomatic or symptomatically improved. The presence or absence of heartburn or its treatment had no bearing on outcome. 
Cardiac tamponade and hydrothorax as complications of central venous parenteral nutrition in infants. The recent use of soft catheters made of silastic polymeric silicone or polyurethane has decreased the incidence of perforation of great veins or right-sided heart chambers but has not eliminated it as had been hoped. Two premature infants who presented with cardiac tamponade more than 24 hr after the insertion of a 23-gauge silastic catheter for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) administration are described. In one infant, bilateral hydrothorax preceded the occurrence of cardiac tamponade. Osmotic injury to great vessels and/or myocardium seems to be the common mechanism but which these complications of intraluminal catheters are produced. Review of the pediatric literature revealed a proportion of low birth weight infants among the reported cases. Despite a prohibitively high mortality rate, early recognition can prevent a fatal outcome. 
Clipping of an aneurysm 20 years after encasement with methyl methacrylate. Case report. A variety of agents have been used to coat aneurysms as an alternative to clipping. These agents were employed more frequently prior to the routine use of the operating microscope and the presently available variety of aneurysm clips. One such coating agent is methyl methacrylate. This report describes a patient with an anterior communicating aneurysm that rebled 20 years after being encased in methyl methacrylate. At operation, the pulsating aneurysm had eroded the adjacent layer of methyl methacrylate, creating a small intervening space. This space allowed removal under the microscope (with a high-speed air drill and a diamond bit) of the methyl methacrylate from the anterior cerebral arteries and aneurysm, exposing it for definitive clip placement. The feasibility of clipping encased aneurysms is discussed. 
Acute venous thrombosis. Therapeutic choices for superficial and deep veins. Superficial thrombophlebitis is common in varicose veins or veins that have undergone trauma from catheters or intravenous medications. Pain and tenderness, warmth, and erythema are diagnostic features. A compression bandage and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent are often all that is required for treatment. Deep vein thrombosis occurs in veins beneath the deep fascia of the leg or in the pelvis or abdomen. It is often asymptomatic but must be treated to prevent pulmonary embolization and postthrombotic syndrome. Standard therapy is administration of heparin sodium for 5 days, followed by tapering and discontinuation. Warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) is sometimes given simultaneously. Longer courses of anti-coagulation therapy are necessary in patients with an ongoing risk of recurrence. 
Tumor necrosis factor. Tumor necrosis factor is important in systemic and cutaneous defense, homeostasis, and many disease states. The numerous and diverse effects of tumor necrosis factor are best understood when considered as concentration-dependent, with normal homeostasis progressing to defense followed by toxic effects. Understanding tumor necrosis factor is important for the dermatologist as more studies appear in our literature and potential clinical uses of tumor necrosis factor (and possible anti-tumor necrosis factor agents) are realized. 
Elevated tissue concentrations of sialyl Lex-i in cancerous tissues compared with those in noncancerous tissues of various organs. Sialyl Lex-i (SLX) concentrations in the extracts of noncancerous and cancerous tissues of various human organs were determined by radioimmunoassay for detailed evaluation of SLX. Cancerous tissues had significantly elevated SLX concentrations compared with noncancerous tissues of various organs. Tissue SLX concentration of the cancerous part was significantly higher than that of the adjacent noncancerous part in the same tissue. There was no significant correlation between tissue SLX concentration and serum SLX level. Positive localization of SLX was clearly observed in such cancerous tissues by immunohistochemical study, although not in any noncancerous tissues. Each of the antigens: SLX, CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen, and CA 125 showed a different distribution pattern in tissue concentration or localization in various organs. These results indicate that SLX may be a valuable cancer-associated antigen produced by malignant tissues, suggesting its clinical application as a tumor marker. 
Multi-parameter flow cytometric quantitation of the expression of the tumor-associated antigen SM3 in normal and neoplastic ovarian tissues. A comparison with HMFG1 and HMFG2. SM3 is a monoclonal antibody that reacts with a peptide epitope in the core protein of polymorphic epithelial mucin. Multi-parameter flow cytometry was used to characterize the expression of SM3 and compare it with two related tumor-associated antigens, HMFG1 and HMFG2, in cell suspensions of 44 malignant ovarian tumors, 15 benign ovarian tumors, and 16 normal ovaries. Tumor-associated antigen expression was significantly higher in malignant ovarian neoplasms than in benign neoplasms (P less than 0.001 for all three antigens). SM3 was expressed more specifically in malignant than benign tumors but had a lower affinity than HMFG1 and HMFG2. Multi-parameter flow cytometric evaluation of a panel of monoclonal antibodies can be used to help in choosing the best antibody for immunohistochemistry, imaging, and eventually treatment of ovarian tumors. 
Isotopic findings in anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery: report of an adult case. Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the main pulmonary trunk results in myocardial ischemia or infarction, and may be a cause of death in the first months of life. Some patients, however, develop satisfactory coronary collateral circulation and remain asymptomatic into adulthood. In these patients, myocardial perfusion and left ventricular function are not well understood. We report the case of a 17-yr-old female patient, suffering from anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the main pulmonary trunk, who underwent reimplantation of the left coronary artery to the aorta. The preoperative permanent 201Tl defect of the left antero-lateral ventricular wall and the abnormal regional wall motion induced by stress exercise testing were fully reversed after the operation. 
Effect of dietary alpha-linolenate on platelet-activating factor production in rat peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The effects of dietary alpha-linolenate (18:3, n-3) and linoleate (18:2, n-6) on platelet-activating factor (PAF) production were examined. Rats were fed an alpha-linolenic acid-rich (perilla oil) diet or a linoleic acid-rich (safflower oil) diet for 6 wk, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) were elicited by peritoneal injection of casein. The overall phospholipid content and composition as well as the subclass distribution of choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids in PMN were not altered by these diets. However, with the perilla oil diet their content of a putative precursor of PAF, 1-alkyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was approximately 50% of that with safflower oil diet. On exposure to various concentrations of FMLP, PAF formation by PMN in the perilla oil group was less than 50% of that by PMN in the safflower oil group. A larger difference in PAF productions by PMN in the two dietary groups was observed on their stimulation with calcium ionophore A23187. These results demonstrate that PAF production is modulated in some as yet unknown way by changing the alpha-linolenate/linoleate balance of the diet. 
"Near miss" death in obstructive sleep apnea: a critical care syndrome. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to alert critical care physicians to the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea with respiratory failure ("near miss" death) and to elucidate characteristics that might allow earlier recognition and treatment of such patients. DESIGN: We examined clinical and laboratory characteristics of eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea presenting to the ICU with respiratory failure. These characteristics were compared with those of eight stable apnea patients of similar severity but without a history of presentation with respiratory failure. SETTING: Medical ICU and pulmonary outpatient clinic at the Houston Veterans Administration Medical Center, a teaching hospital affiliated with Baylor College of Medicine. PATIENTS: Eight patients with obstructive sleep apnea who presented in, or developed, acute respiratory failure requiring tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were matched to eight stable obstructive sleep apnea outpatients from the chest clinic. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The records of these 16 patients were reviewed and multiple characteristics that might predict these obstructive sleep apnea patients prone to respiratory failure and death (called the "near miss" death group; n = 8) were examined. The mean age of the near miss group was 57 yrs. All eight patients presented with respiratory acidosis (mean pH 7.22), hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 82 torr [10.9 kPa]), and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 45 torr [6.0 kPa]). Six of the eight patients had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as determined by clinical characteristics and spirometry. Predisposing factors included facial trauma, lower respiratory tract infections or bronchospasm, and use of pain medication. All but one of the near miss subjects had awake hypercarbia (mean PaCO2 49 torr [6.5 kPa]) and hypoxemia (mean PaO2 58 torr [7.7 kPa]) during periods of clinical stability while only two controls had concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and none had hypercarbia. The prevalence of a history of wheezing and prior hospitalization for "respiratory problems" were greater in the near miss group. Once cured of apnea, no patient presented with recurrence of respiratory failure in follow-up ranging from 6 to 80 months, and cor pulmonale recurred in only one patient during subsequent onset of central apneas. CONCLUSION: Patients with obstructive sleep apnea who have concomitant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hypercarbia and hypoxemia are more prone to develop severe respiratory failure and probable death than those patients with apnea alone. The current study shows that recurrent respiratory failure and presumably mortality from this acute complication can be reversed with effective treatment of the obstructive apnea. 
Community control of scabies: a model based on use of permethrin cream For 18 years treatment with lindane or crotamiton products has failed to stem the epidemic of scabies among the Kuna Indians in the San Blas islands of the Republic of Panama. Permethrin 5% cream was introduced as the only treatment in a programme to control scabies on an island of 756 inhabitants and involving workers recruited locally. Prevalence fell from 33% to less than 1% after every person was treated. As long as continued surveillance and treatment of newly introduced cases was maintained, prevalence of scabies remained below 1.5% for over 3 years. When supply of medication was interrupted for 3 weeks, prevalence rose to 3.6%. When control was lost after the US invasion of Panama, prevalence rose to 12% within 3 months. Bacterial skin infections decreased dramatically when scabies was controlled. Permethrin is safe and effective even in areas where this disease has become resistant to lindane. 
Localization of breakthrough site of canine monomorphic ventricular tachycardia by pacemapping. A vectorial approach. BACKGROUND. The precision and limitations of ventricular pacemapping as a method to localize the site of earliest breakthrough of ventricular tachycardia (VT) were investigated in a canine model of experimental myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS. Forty-one episodes of VT induced in 10 animals were mapped using a standard grid of 64 endocardial and epicardial bipolar electrodes to determine the site of earliest endocardial or epicardial breakthrough of activation during VT. Each of these 64 recording sites was also used for ventricular pacing during sinus rhythm at cycle lengths comparable to those of the VTs. Orthogonal X, Y, and Z Frank electrocardiographic (ECG) leads were recorded during all episodes of VT and ventricular pacing from all sites after the chest was closed in all animals. Surface ECG waveforms corresponding to each VT and each ventricular pacing were compared pairwise by measuring the Euclidean metric difference between the VT and ventricular pacing vectors with the orthogonal ECG leads as their X, Y, and Z components. The pacing site that generated the vector most similar to VT vector (smallest vectorial difference) was defined as the predicted breakthrough site. This predicted site of breakthrough was identical to the actual site of breakthrough determined by activation sequence mapping during VT for only nine VTs (22%). However, for an additional 27 VTs (66%), the observed and predicted breakthrough locations were at adjacent (1 cm or less apart) recording sites. For five VTs (12%), the two sites were remote, the distance between them exceeding 1 cm. CONCLUSIONS. In this model, locating the breakthrough site by pacemapping is exact in only a small minority of VTs. However, when orthogonal surface ECG leads are used for comparison, pacemapping can predict the site of earliest breakthrough during VT with a 1-cm resolution in the majority of VTs. 
Prevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in kidney transplant recipients. Cutaneous lesions can be a significant problem in kidney transplant recipients. Factors such as climate and skin types have been implicated as modifiers of these clinical manifestations. With the purpose of determining the prevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in a group of Hispanic kidney transplant recipients in a tropical climate, 82 serial unselected patients were examined. Seventy-eight were found to have some type of skin disease. Infections of the skin were the most common, followed by drug-induced changes and malignant or premalignant cutaneous tumors. Except for the preponderance of superficial mycotic infections, the overall results in our population are in agreement with other series. 
Elevated cortical venous pressure in hydrocephalus. To gain a better understanding of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hydrodynamics and their relationship to the cerebrovascular system, normal and naturally hydrocephalic dogs were studied to determine transmantle [lateral ventricle (LV) to subarachnoid space] and transparenchymal [LV to cortical vein (CV)] pressures. Pressure was also measured in the sagittal sinus, cisterna magna, and femoral artery. CV pressure has not previously been measured in hydrocephalus. Ventricular volume was determined by computed tomography. Four groups of animals were studied. In Group 1 (n = 5) transmantle pressure was measured; in Group 2 (n = 5), transparenchymal pressure in normal animals was measured. In Group 3 (n = 5) was measured all the pressures in spontaneously normal animals, and in Group 4 (n = 6) was measured the pressures in hydrocephalic animals. The pressure-volume index and CSF outflow resistance were also measured. LV volume in the normal dogs was 1.3 +/- 0.7 ml and in the hydrocephalic dogs was 5.1 +/- 2.7 ml (P less than 0.005). Although LV, subarachnoid space, and sagittal sinus pressures were elevated in the hydrocephalic dogs (15.1 versus 10.2, 16.4 versus 10.5, and 8.4 versus 5.2 mm Hg, respectively), the transmantle pressure and subarachnoid space to sagittal sinus gradients were not significantly altered. CV pressure was markedly elevated in the hydrocephalic animals (21.5 versus 11.7 mm Hg, P less than 0.005). The pressure-volume index and outflow resistance were not significantly different. These results suggest that an elevated CV pressure plays a role in the development and/or maintenance of hydrocephalus, and that the pathway for CSF absorption includes transcapillary or transvenular absorption of CSF from the interstitial space. 
Repeated intestinal ulcerations in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and high serum antiphospholipid antibody levels. We report the case of a patient with SLE who had repeated ulceration of the small intestine requiring emergency surgery. Pathologic examination revealed microthrombosis and vasculitis at the site of the intestinal ulcers. High levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged prothrombin time coincided with the episodes of intestinal ulceration. Antiphospholipid antibodies may be involved in the development of thrombosis resulting in the repeated episodes of intestinal ulceration in this patient. This possibility should be considered in patients with SLE who have intestinal ulceration and appropriate antithrombotic medication should be administered. 
Chronic and recurrent ankle sprains. Persistent symptoms such as pain, swelling, or giving way after lateral ligament injuries of the ankle are not uncommon. The treating orthopedist must first decide whether the symptoms are related to the ankle instability. Intra-articular or extra-articular injury may occur concomitantly with either a stable or unstable ankle, and careful diagnostic evaluation must be undertaken. Arthroscopy of the unstable ankle in which there is significant pain without demonstrable intra-articular injury by bone scans, CT scans, and MRI studies is indicated, as intra-articular lesions do occur that may result in chronic pain after the ankle has been rendered stable. An arthroscopic lateral ankle capsulodesis procedure has been described with promising early results. Arthroscopic management of an intra-articular pathologic condition in the stable ankle involves removal or excision of offending bone and/or soft tissue. Patients' symptoms can be improved significantly by these approaches, after which there can be a return to a more normal level of function. 
The influence of preoperative shock on outcome in sequential endocardial resection for ventricular tachycardia. Sequential endocardial resection was used in 92 consecutive patients to treat ventricular tachycardia. All patients had coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction. All patients had repeated cycles of mapping and resection of arrhythmogenic foci in the normothermic beating heart until ventricular tachycardia was no longer inducible. Eighty-six patients (93%) survived to hospital discharge. The survival rate in patients normotensive at the time of operation was 98% and in patients in shock at the time of operation, 43%. By Cox regression analysis, preoperative shock was the significant predictor (p less than 0.001) of operative mortality. Seventy-four of the 86 operative survivors (86%) had no sustained ventricular tachycardia at initial postoperative electrophysiologic study when receiving no antiarrhythmic drugs. Eighty-three of the 86 operative survivors (97%) had no sustained ventricular tachycardia at final postoperative electrophysiologic study when using antiarrhythmic drugs as needed. After a median follow-up of 21 months (range 1 to 79 months) there were 4 sudden cardiac deaths, 12 other cardiac deaths, and 3 noncardiac deaths. There were no documented nonfatal episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia after hospital discharge. Use of the sequential endocardial resection technique is effective in curing ventricular tachycardia with low operative morbidity and mortality. 
Serum concentrations of tumour necrosis factor alpha in childhood chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Serum tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) concentrations were measured by enzyme linked immunoadsorbent assay in 31 normal children and during 65 episodes of clinical remission and 54 episodes of relapse in 92 children with chronic inflammatory bowel disease. An appreciable rise in TNF alpha was found only in children in relapse of ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease. The group of children with small bowel Crohn's disease in relapse did not show increases of TNF alpha above control concentrations, despite an equivalent rise in disease indices. Height velocity was depressed in children with relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis compared with the equivalent condition in remission. The impairment of growth velocity was significantly greater in relapse of large bowel Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis than in small bowel Crohn's disease alone, although for the subgroups in stage 1 puberty (prepubertal) the differences were not significant. Inadequate growth in chronic inflammatory bowel disease is currently ascribed to inadequate nutrition and TNF alpha may contribute to this through its cachexia inducing effects. It may, in addition, diminish pituitary growth hormone release. These results suggest that production of TNF alpha may be associated with growth failure in relapse of colonic inflammatory bowel disease. 
Naltrexone in functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and in the normal luteal phase. Fifteen young women with a diagnosis of secondary hypothalamic amenorrhea of at least 2 years' duration were given either 50 mg naltrexone daily or placebo, following a randomized double-blind crossover scheme. Seven patients did not menstruate with either therapy. In the other eight, the following results were recorded (mean +/- SD and range): a cycle length of 28.7 +/- 7.6 (12-45) days for naltrexone compared with 30.8 +/- 5.9 (16-43) days for placebo, a follicular phase length of 20.8 +/- 5.4 (14-34) days for naltrexone and 23.2 +/- 4.3 (19-32) days for naltrexone and 8.3 +/- 1.6 (5-10) days for placebo. The number of ovulatory cycles was 18 of 24 (75%) with naltrexone and eight of 24 (33%) with placebo (P less than .05). Most luteal phases were short. In five normally menstruating women, we gave either naltrexone or placebo in the luteal phase using a crossover blinded scheme. Steroidogenesis in the normal luteal phase was not impaired by naltrexone therapy. In functional hypothalamic amenorrheic patients with normal weight, menstruation might be restored by either placebo or naltrexone, but naltrexone provides a clinical and therapeutic advantage by increasing the ovulation rate. 
Air travel in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Air travel exposes patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to the risk of severe hypoxemia. We sought to determine the frequency and outcome of airline travel in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A cohort of 100 patients (76 men and 24 women; age 67 +/- 7 years [mean +/- SD]) with severe chronic pulmonary obstructive disease examined by means of spirometry (forced expiratory volume in the first second, 0.04 +/- 0.35 L), all military retirees, or their dependents, comprised the study population. Forty-four patients traveled by commercial air carrier over a 28-month interval, giving an annual frequency of 18.9% of these patients per year. The group that did not travel by air (n = 56) had a lower mean value for forced expiratory volume in the first second and greater prevalence of home oxygen use than did the group that did travel by air. Twelve of the travelers (27.3%) consulted a physician beforehand. Flights reached foreign destinations for 22.7% of patients. The median duration of the longest flight segment was 3 hours. A minority of patients (34.3%) occupied seats in the smoking sections of aircraft. A majority (56.8%) ambulated aboard the aircraft during flights. Eight patients (18.2%) reported transient symptoms during air travel. We conclude that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease travel with appreciable frequency, often without medical consultation, and develop symptoms in some cases. 
An approach to pediatric trauma. Unique anatomic and pathophysiologic aspects of the pediatric patient. Effective evaluation and management of the pediatric trauma patient is based on knowledge of the unique anatomic and pathophysiologic differences in children. An understanding of these differences along with the trauma resuscitation guidelines established by the American College of Surgeons will allow the trauma team to provide systematic and comprehensive resuscitation of the child with multiple injuries. Continued research in the field of pediatric trauma resuscitation and the ongoing efforts of the National Pediatric Trauma Registry will continue to advance our understanding and management of injured children. 
Chronic mitoinhibition during promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis. We have reported previously that orotic acid (OA), a precursor for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, is able to promote carcinogenic process in both liver and duodenum of rats. The present study investigates the possible role of mitoinhibitory effects of OA as being responsible for its promotional effects. Male Fischer 344 rats were given a semisynthetic basal diet (BD) or a diet containing 1% OA for four weeks coupled with 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH), and all animals were then continued on BD for an additional four weeks. This protocol is known to exert a promoting effect on the initiated rat liver. Livers were perfused, and the labeling index (LI) of isolated cultured hepatocytes was monitored. Hepatocytes isolated from livers of rats fed a BD or 1% OA exhibited in vitro an LI of 39 +/- 2 and 24 +/- 1%, respectively. The lowered in vitro LI was seen even upon exposure to epidermal growth factor (EGF) (67 +/- 2% in OA-treated livers compared to 91 +/- 2% in hepatocytes from control rat liver). A similar four-week exposure to OA coupled with PH decreased hepatic DNA synthesis induced by a choline-deficient diet in vivo by about 50%. These results indicate that OA is able to decrease the response of normal hepatocytes to growth factors and suggest a possible mechanism of chronic differential mitoinhibition as a basis for promotion induced by OA. 
The decline of mortality due to stroke: a competitive and deterministic perspective. Although stroke mortality has been declining since the first part of this century, the rate of decline increased sharply during the early 1970s. The basis for the fall in stroke mortality is often attributed to effective management of risk factors, particularly hypertension. However, some investigators have questioned whether risk factor reduction alone can adequately account for the magnitude of the recent decline in stroke mortality. When viewed from the perspective of competitive and deterministic mortality dynamics, the major force decreasing stroke mortality is the decreasing deterministic competitiveness of stroke and the increasing deterministic competitiveness of various malignant neoplasms and degenerative diseases as causes of mortality. These reciprocal trends are a natural consequence of the competitive deterministic mortality dynamics which describe these diseases in an environment that is becoming more conducive to human survival. The competitive nature of human mortality makes drawing etiopathogenic conclusions based upon single disease mortality data hazardous. 
Hemoglobin-acetaldehyde adducts in human volunteers following acute ethanol ingestion. Rabbit antibodies against albumin-acetaldehyde adduct were used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect acetaldehyde-hemoglobin condensates from the blood of 12 volunteers following ingestion of 1.3 to 2.9 g of ethanol per kg body weight during 8 hr. Blood samples were drawn before drinking and between 2 to 46 hr after starting the drinking session. While there were no significant increases in blood acetaldehyde levels in these samples, acetaldehyde-hemoglobin adducts were significantly increased in the samples drawn after ethanol had been eliminated from the body. Administration of ethanol (0.1 g/kg) to an Oriental flusher resulted in an increase both in blood acetaldehyde and the hemoglobin-acetaldehyde adduct levels. These results suggest that acetaldehyde-hemoglobin condensates are formed in vivo following acute ethanol ingestion. Such condensates may be of value to mark alcohol consumption. 
Relationship of stress, distress, and the immunologic response to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. BACKGROUND. Many studies have investigated the relationship between psychosocial factors and the susceptibility to infectious diseases. Fewer studies have investigated the relationship between stress and the immunologic response to vaccines. A follow-up study was designed to investigate the relationships between stress, distress, and the antibody response to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. METHODS. Eighty-one seronegative medical students received a standard immunization protocol of a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. Six months after the first dose, corresponding to the induction phase of immunization, each subject completed both the Survey of Life Experiences and the Symptom Distress Check List to assess levels of stress and distress during that period. Three months after the third dose, corresponding to the booster phase of immunization, each subject completed the same questionnaires and was also tested for a quantitative hepatitis B surface antibody titer. Correlations were statistically analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and stepwise multifactorial regression analysis. RESULTS. Higher levels of negatively perceived stress, irascibility, depression, and anxiety during the induction phase of immunization were significantly associated with higher peak antibody titers. Together these psychosocial factors accounted for 5.8% of the variance, and were as strong a determinant of peak antibody titer as was age. CONCLUSIONS. In addition to the known vaccine-related and biological factors, psychosocial factors appear to affect the immune response to a recombinant hepatitis B vaccine. The positive direction of the correlation raises the question of whether the effect of psychosocial factors on antibody formation is different from their effect on antibody function. 
Endothelium-dependent contraction and relaxation of the human and canine internal mammary artery: studies on bypass graft vasospasm. The internal mammary artery (IMA) is the preferred conduit for coronary artery bypass graft because of superior late patency. However, IMA vasospasm may contribute to myocardial ischemia and early postoperative morbidity. To investigate mechanisms of vasospasm, we compared the reactivity of human and canine IMA segments in vitro to agonists known to release endothelium-derived contracting factor and endothelium-derived relaxing factor. Rings (4 mm in length) of human and canine IMA were studied in organ chambers. Human and canine vascular smooth muscle exhibited comparable contraction to norepinephrine (maximum = 7.55 +/- 0.63 gm and 6.4 +/- 0.90 gm, respectively) and relaxation to sodium nitroprusside. Human and canine IMAs exhibited comparable endothelium-derived relaxing factor-mediated relaxations to acetylcholine (human) and methacholine (canine). Human and canine IMA also exhibited comparable endothelium-dependent contraction to hypoxia (to 173.3% +/- 8.1% and 178.9% +/- 16.0% of initial prehypoxic tension; means +/- SEM; n = 12). Endothelium-dependent contraction to hypoxia in human and canine IMA could be attenuated by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (10(-6) mol/L), a competitive inhibitor of L-arginine metabolism (n = 9 and n = 10 for human and canine; p less than 0.05). These studies establish that the canine is an appropriate model for study of human IMA vascular reactivity and that hypoxia can induce the release of an L-arginine-dependent, endothelium-derived contracting factor in the human and canine IMA. In vivo, the release of endothelium-derived contracting factor in response to hypoxemia may be cause of IMA vasospasm. 
Effect of intrathecal fibrinolysis on cerebrospinal fluid absorption after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. The effect of intrathecal fibrinolysis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption was investigated after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). In 11 cats, SAH was induced by intracisternal application of 1 to 4 ml of fresh autologous blood. Thirty minutes after the experimental SAH, the CSF outflow resistance was found to be elevated from a median of 77 mm Hg/ml/min (range 41.3 to 109 mm Hg/ml/min) to a median of 580 mm Hg/ml/min (range 104 to 7000 mm Hg/ml/min). A logarithmic relationship could be demonstrated between the volume of subarachnoid blood and the elevation of the CSF outflow resistance. The intrathecal application of 2 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), which is a fibrinolytic substance suitable for lysis of subarachnoid blood clots in man, resulted in an almost total restoration of CSF absorption after experimental SAH. The CSF outflow resistance after SAH was lowered by application of rt-PA from a median of 1028.05 mm Hg/ml/min (range 394 to 7000 mm Hg/ml/min) to 79 mm Hg/ml/min (range 56.7 to 223 mm Hg/ml/min). It is concluded that the impairment of CSF absorption after SAH may play an important role in the pathogenesis of post-hemorrhagic vasospasm. 
Erythroleukemia in a child associated with monosomy 7. A case of erythroleukemia (EL) associated with monosomy 7 is reported. The EL was diagnosed 20 months after the initial diagnosis of monosomy 7 was made. An immunologic study of the blast cells using a monoclonal antibody was positive for glycophorin A, which suggested that they were of erythroid origin; this was confirmed by electron microscopy. Chemotherapy was started with low dose cytarabine. However, the patient had severe bone marrow suppression and died of pneumonia. Our case shows that monosomy 7 is an abnormality of the pluripotential stem cells, including erythroid cells, that resulted in a true erythroid neoplasm. 
Delayed presentation of a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula in a patient with traumatic brain injury. Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas are rare complications of traumatic brain injury, facial trauma and postorthognathic surgery. A high level of clinical suspicion is necessary, particularly for patients who are unable to communicate, to establish the diagnosis. A case of delayed presentation of a carotid-cavernous sinus fistula after traumatic brain injury is presented. This case illustrates that early recognition of this disorder is crucial to prevent significant morbidity. 
Chronic reversal of hemifield loss after intraocular pressure lowering in advanced glaucoma. Lowering intraocular pressure in two cases of severe glaucoma was associated with a chronic reversal of hemifield loss, as documented by automated threshold perimetry. In the first case, a small central 10 degrees island of vision expanded to 40 degrees in both hemifields eight months after intraocular pressure lowering by filtration surgery. The mean deviation of the central 30 degrees field improved by more than 14dB or 1.4 log units. To our knowledge, this case represents the greatest degree of reversal of chronic visual field loss reported in the literature. In the second case, a small central 10 degrees island of vision slowly expanded to 40 degrees in the inferior hemifield over a three-year period. 
Spinal cord protection during aortic occlusion: efficacy of intrathecal tetracaine. Spinal cord ischemia and resultant paraplegia are devastating sequelae in up to 40% of patients undergoing repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. We investigated the effect of intrathecal tetracaine on the neurological sequelae of spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion with aortic occlusion. Cocaine-derived anesthetics (lidocaine and its analogues) have been shown to decrease neuronal cell metabolism and also have specific neuronal membrane stabilizing effects. New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized and spinal cord ischemia was then induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion. Animals were divided into six treatment groups. Tetracaine (groups 2 and 4) or normal saline solution (group 5) was administered intrathecally before aortic cross-clamping. Groups 1 and 3 functioned as controls. Group 6 animals received intravenous thiopental. Rabbits were classified as either neurologically normal or injured (paralyzed or paretic). Among controls, 25 minutes of aortic occlusion produced varied neurological sequelae (group 1, 3/6 injured, 50%) whereas 30 minutes resulted in more consistent injury (group 3, 5/6 injured, 83%). All rabbits that received intrathecal saline solution were paralyzed (group 5, 4/4 injured, 100%). Animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion of 30 minutes (group 4) showed significantly better preservation of neurological function (6/7 normal, 86%) than controls and saline-treated animals (groups 3 and 5). All animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion for 25 minutes (group 2) showed no signs of injury (5/5 normal, 100%), but this was not significant versus controls (group 1). Intravenous thiopental (group 6, 5/5 injured, 100%) had no beneficial effect. Intrathecal tetracaine significantly and dramatically abrogated the neurological injury secondary to spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion after aortic occlusion at 30 minutes in the rabbit model. 
IIB osteosarcoma. Current management, local control, and survival statistics--Sao Paulo, Brazil. Ninety-two patients with IIB osteosarcoma of the extremities were treated with intraarterial (IA) cisplatinum (CDDP) followed by surgery [amputation (61.6%) or resection with endoprosthesis (38.4%)]. Postoperative chemotherapy alternating adriamycin and CDDP was used. The total three-year survival was 62.1%, and the disease-free survival was 41.1%. The pathologic evaluation of the degree of tumor necrosis in response to the IA CDDP showed that in 53.2%, the necrosis was over 90%. The multivariate analysis of prognostic factors has shown that the highest survival was among females with tumors smaller than 15 cm. Patients with lesions equal to or larger than 15 cm were three times as likely to die of the disease. A second, more aggressive study is now underway, in which high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is preoperatively combined with adriamycin and CDDP. Following operation, ifosfamide is added to the cases with a smaller degree of tumor necrosis, while the other group of patients will continue with HDMTX, in addition to CDDP and adriamycin (these last two drugs are used in both arms). Until now, complete remission has been achieved in 82% and 86%, respectively, with a follow-up examination varying from four to 26 months (average, 14 months). This is of extreme importance, because the majority of the authors' patients have tumors at initial evaluation larger than 10 cm in diameter. 
Expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia: an in situ analysis. The c-myc gene plays a pivotal role in mediating the competence state for cell cycle transversion. This biologic role is in contradiction to reports of elevated expression of the gene in multiple myeloma, a tumor with restricted self-renewal capacity. To more clearly define the role of this gene in plasma cells of myeloma patients, c-myc messenger RNA (mRNA) and/or oncoprotein expression were semiquantitatively analyzed on the single cell level in 19 cases of multiple myeloma, among them 1 biclonal case and 1 case with coexistent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Performing anti-sense/mRNA in situ hybridization, mature c-myc gene transcripts were detected in 92% (12 of 13) of cases and could definitely be attributed to the plasma cells by our study. The number of Ki 67-positive plasma cells actively passing the cell cycle was less than 1% and independent of c-myc gene expression. However, because the presence of the 152-c-MYC epitope was correlated to extent of marrow plasmacytosis (r = .64; P = .043) and content of plasmablasts (P = .09), the c-myc gene might serve a function different from proliferative activity, but also associated with tumor cell mass. In CLL cells (21 of 22 cases) and their benign counterparts, ie, bone marrow and peripheral blood lymphocytes, the anti-sense/c-myc mRNA hybridization signals remained below the threshold considered as cutpoint between negative and positive. The low amounts of c-myc transcripts were correlated to neither stage of disease (P = .52) nor lymphocyte counts (P = .24). Because the numbers of peripheral blood lymphoma cells were independent of tumor mass and of c-myc gene transcripts expressed, peripheral blood lymphocytosis might more likely reflect homing processes than proliferative activity in CLL. 
The diabetic foot: consequences of delayed treatment and referral. The pathophysiology of foot problems in diabetic patients is poorly understood by many physicians. Two major factors that frequently lead to a delay in appropriate treatment with subsequent limb loss are failure to appreciate the presence and severity of underlying infection and attribution of gangrene of the toe and forefoot to microvascular disease. To evaluate the consequences of delayed recognition and treatment, we reviewed the records of 55 diabetic patients with localized gangrene or infection of the forefoot in 62 limbs, treated consecutively on a single vascular surgical service over a 2-year period using a standard protocol. All appropriately treated neuropathic ulcers and forefoot infections healed in patients with palpable pedal pulses. If foot pulses were absent and arteriography confirmed large-vessel occlusive disease, foot lesions and infections likewise healed if concomitant revascularization was done. In our series, 33 bypasses were required because of severe atherosclerotic occlusive disease. Only one patient had "unreconstructable" arterial disease. Limb salvage was 86% at a mean follow-up of 12.4 months. In 16 of the patients (29%), there was a prolonged delay between initial treatment and referral for definitive care. The specific causes of delay were underestimation of the severity of foot infection in 10 patients, and lack of recognition of ischemia due to large-vessel occlusive disease in six. These delays led to more proximal levels of amputation in six patients, including three below-knee amputations in patients with limbs that were initially salvageable. 
Efficacy and toxicity of pentostam against Panamanian mucosal leishmaniasis. We tested the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended treatment for mucosal leishmaniasis in 16 Panamanians with disease due to Leishmania braziliensis panamensis. Disease was mild in this population because it was limited to the nasal mucosa and only one patient had septal perforation. The patients were administered 20 mg antimony (in the form of Pentostam) per kg intravenously each day for 28 days. Ten patients completed therapy and were cured at 12 month follow-up. Three patients completed therapy, healed their lesions, but relapsed at the six or 12 month follow-up. Three patients terminated therapy prematurely because of liver enzyme elevations in conjunction with either EKG abnormalities or musculoskeletal complaints; none of these patients were healed. This study indicates that in patients with mild mucosal leishmaniasis, the WHO regimen is curative in 77% patients who complete treatment and in 63% of all patients. 
Intracoronary thrombus formation causes focal vasoconstriction of epicardial arteries in patients with coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND. Experimental studies have demonstrated that intracoronary platelet aggregation and thrombus formation may induce marked vasoconstriction of epicardial arteries with endothelial injury. METHODS AND RESULTS. To examine the effects of intracoronary thrombus formation on coronary vasomotor tone of human epicardial arteries in vivo, we studied 15 patients who developed intracoronary thrombi adherent to the guide wire during balloon dilatation. Epicardial artery luminal area was evaluated by quantitative coronary angiography proximal and distal to the site of intracoronary thrombus formation and in a reference vessel before and after thrombus formation as well as after intracoronary injection of 0.2-0.3 mg nitroglycerin. All artery segments distal to the site of thrombus formation showed vasoconstriction with a luminal area reduction of -27.4 +/- 17.1% (p less than 0.001), whereas proximal vessel segments and reference vessels not manipulated during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty did not demonstrate any significant luminal area changes during thrombus formation. Angiographic measurements after advancing the guide wire with the adherent thrombus (performed in six of the 15 patients) revealed in all patients that vasoconstriction did develop at a new site distal to the thrombus persistence of the initial vasoconstriction now residing proximal to the thrombus. Thus, there was a sequential association between thrombus formation and subsequent distal vasoconstriction. Intracoronary injection of nitroglycerin abolished the thrombus-induced vasoconstriction. No significant luminal area changes were observed in 20 patients without angiographic evidence of intracoronary thrombus formation. CONCLUSIONS. Intracoronary thrombus formation during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty causes focal vasoconstriction of epicardial arteries in patients with coronary artery disease. Although caution must be advised in the extrapolation of this phenomenon, which was observed in a manipulated artery during coronary angioplasty, the vasoconstrictor response to intracoronary thrombus formation in vivo may play an important role in the dynamic mechanisms of acute coronary heart disease syndromes. 
Mitochondrial encephalopathies: molecular genetic diagnosis from blood samples. Point mutations of mitochondrial DNA have been described in the muscle of patients with syndromes of myoclonic epilepsy and ragged red fibres (MERRF) and of mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS). We have found the MERRF mutation in members of 6 British kindreds; 2 of these had unusual phenotypes but all index patients had myoclonus. The MELAS mutation was detected in 17 patients from 16 families, who had a wide range of clinical features that particularly affected the central nervous system; stroke-like episodes were observed in 10.3 patients with mitochondrial DNA mutations did not have ragged red fibres on muscle biopsy, generally considered to be the morphological hallmark of mitochondrial diseases. In all 6 patients with the MERRF mutation, and 10 of 11 with the MELAS mutation, the genetic defect was easily detected in blood cells as well as muscle (blood samples were not available in 6 patients with MELAS mutations in muscle). Molecular genetic analysis of blood samples represents an inexpensive and reliable screening test for mitochondrial encephalopathies, and use of such techniques could influence diagnosis and genetic counselling in patients with seizure disorders and young-onset stroke. 
Overview: rationale of thrombolysis in treating acute myocardial infarction. Treatment of coronary thrombosis with thrombolytic agents was first introduced in the 1950s. Clinical trials, primarily with streptokinase during the 1960s and 1970s, addressed the effects of thrombolysis on mortality rates after acute myocardial infarction, but were inconclusive and largely ignored. In 1976, Chazov et al. from the Soviet Union demonstrated that intracoronary streptokinase could produce prompt recanalization of a totally occluded infarct-related artery. In 1980, DeWood et al. demonstrated that 87% of patients with classic Q-wave myocardial infarction had total occlusion from coronary thrombosis of the infarct-related artery when studied during the first 4 hours of their infarction and that 65% of these arteries were still occluded when patients were studied between 12 and 24 hours after infarction. These observations stimulated renewed interest in thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Mortality trials have subsequently demonstrated that agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, streptokinase, and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex remarkably reduce early mortality rates among patients with acute myocardial infarction when treatment is instituted within the first 6 hours of infarction. Benefit has yet to be demonstrated, however, in patients with acute myocardial infarction characterized by ST-segment depression. This whole area is currently under study by the TIMI investigators. TIMI-3B is a mortality study in which patients with either non-Q-wave myocardial infarction or unstable angina with rest pain are randomly assigned to receive either tissue plasminogen activator or placebo. Results of this trial will help us in the future to determine the appropriate role of thrombolytic therapy in treating acute ischemic syndromes other than transmural myocardial infarction. 
Expression of HIV-1 in the cerebrospinal fluid detected by the polymerase chain reaction and its correlation with central nervous system disease. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect HIV-1 sequences (gag, pol, and env) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum samples from 53 HIV-1-positive patients and the results correlated with clinical evidence of neurological disease. Twenty-three out of 24 patients with neurological disease had HIV-1-specific sequences in CSF compared with four out of 20 asymptomatic patients who had no evidence of neurological involvement. The detection of HIV RNA sequences by PCR in the CSF of HIV-positive patients may provide early, rapid and direct evidence of neurological involvement in asymptomatic subjects. 
Autocrine stimulation by erythropoietin and autonomous growth of human erythroid leukemic cells in vitro. Autonomous colony formation is a frequent event in erythroleukemia. In 13 cases of early erythroid leukemias, we investigated whether erythropoietin (Epo) autocrine stimulation was responsible for the growth factor autonomy. Epo transcripts were detected by Northern blotting in cells from one patient. These cells also expressed an Epo receptor (1,000 receptors per cell) with a 420-pM affinity and Epo was detected in the supernatant of cultured cells. In 8 of the 13 cases, Epo transcripts were revealed by the polymerase chain reaction ranging from 0.5 to 500 copies per cell. In situ hybridization proved that these Epo transcripts were present in the blast cells. No Epo gene abnormalities were detected by Southern blotting. In two cases, leukemic cells were grown in the presence of Epo-neutralizing antibodies or Epo antisense oligomers. In one case, the antibody significantly reduced autonomous growth. In contrast, the antibody had no effect in the second case in which blast cells transcribed the Epo gene at a low level. However, Epo antisense oligomers partially inhibited autonomous growth. This inhibition was reversed by addition of exogenous Epo. Overall, these results suggest that an extracellular or intracellular autocrine Epo stimulation occurs in some cases of erythroid malignancies. 
Edematous pancreatitis associated with intravenous pentamidine. A 37-year-old black man with presumed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who was treated with systemic IV pentamidine had fatal pancreatitis and massive hepatomegaly. Fatal pancreatitis can occur with no hemorrhagic changes seen at autopsy. Awareness of the relationship between pentamidine and pancreatitis should be emphasized. With current clinical trials testing other routes of administration, fatal complications associated with IV pentamidine therapy will be minimized. 
A component of calcium-activated potassium channels encoded by the Drosophila slo locus. Calcium-activated potassium channels mediate many biologically important functions in electrically excitable cells. Despite recent progress in the molecular analysis of voltage-activated K+ channels, Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels have not been similarly characterized. The Drosophila slowpoke (slo) locus, mutations of which specifically abolish a Ca(2+)-activated K+ current in muscles and neurons, provides an opportunity for molecular characterization of these channels. Genomic and complementary DNA clones from the slo locus were isolated and sequenced. The polypeptide predicted by slo is similar to voltage-activated K+ channel polypeptides in discrete domains known to be essential for function. Thus, these results indicate that slo encodes a structural component of Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels. 
The effects of benzodiazepine-receptor antagonists and partial inverse agonists on acute hepatic encephalopathy in the rat. Two benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists (Ro 15-4513, Ro 15-3505) and one benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist (flumazenil) were administered to rats with hepatic encephalopathy due to acute liver ischemia. Significant improvement (P less than 0.002) of both the clinical grade of hepatic encephalopathy and the electroencephalographic abnormalities was observed after administration of the benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists: comatose rats with no spontaneous righting reflex regained consciousness immediately after injection of the drug. Only slight improvement in clinical hepatic encephalopathy grade was seen after administration of 25 mg/kg of flumazenil. The present data strongly support a role of increased gamma-aminobutyric acid-ergic tone in the pathogenesis of acute hepatic encephalopathy and provide a rationale for trials of benzodiazepine-receptor partial inverse agonists to restore consciousness in hepatic encephalopathy in humans in the near future. 
The effect of palliative radiation therapy on epidural compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma. The efficacy of palliative radiation therapy in the treatment of spinal cord and cauda equina compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma was evaluated in 38 sites in 35 patients treated between 1970 and 1990. All patients had radiographic documentation of epidural compression. The median dose of radiation therapy was 2850 cGy (range, 500 to 4000 cGy), with daily fractions ranging from 200 to 800 cGy. Twenty-eight sites in 26 patients were evaluable 1 month after completion of radiation therapy, and symptoms responded completely in 11 of 28 (39%) sites. Fourteen sites (46%) showed a partial response of symptoms. Response lasting until death was documented in 21 of 26 patients (81%). Patients receiving a total dose of 3000 cGy or greater were more likely to achieve a complete response than those receiving less than 3000 cGy (62% versus 20%) by univariate (P = 0.025) and multivariate (P = 0.048) analyses. A treatment program of radiation therapy and corticosteroids is effective in palliating the symptoms of epidural compression due to metastatic malignant melanoma. It is recommended to deliver an accelerated course of radiation therapy to a dose of 3000 cGy or greater without exceeding spinal cord tolerance (e.g., 3000 cGy in ten fractions at 300 cGy per fraction). 
Genes for epilepsy mapped in the mouse. The neurological mutant mouse strain E1 is a model for complex partial seizures in humans. The inheritance of epileptic seizures with seven conventional chromosomal markers and over 60 endogenous proviral markers was studied by means of back-crosses of E1 with two seizure-resistant strains, DBA/2J and ABP/LeJ. The major gene responsible for this epileptic phenotype (El-1) was localized to a region distal with respect to the centromere on chromosome 9. At least one other gene, El-2, linked to proviral markers on chromosome 2, also influences the seizure phenotype. In addition, a potential modifier of seizures was detected in the DBA/2J background. The location of El-1 on distal chromosome 9 may allow identification of an epilepsy candidate gene in humans on the basis of conserved synteny with human chromosome 3. 
Treatment of primary sclerosing cholangitis with oral methotrexate. Ten patients with well-documented primary sclerosing cholangitis who had no signs of portal hypertension or liver failure were treated with oral pulse methotrexate for at least 1 yr. The methotrexate dose averaged 15 mg/wk (0.2 mg/kg/wk). All six patients who were symptomatic became asymptomatic within 1-5 months of starting methotrexate. Biochemical tests of liver function improved in all patients. The alkaline phosphatase value decreased from a mean (+/-SD) of 373 +/- 210 IU to 140 +/- 77 IU (p = 0.0008), the mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) from 115 +/- 74 to 76 +/- 79 U/L (p = 0.005), and the mean aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value from 88 +/- 37 to 57 +/- 40 U/L (p = 0.007). The improvement in mean bilirubin (1.19 +/- 1.41 to 0.67 +/- 0.25 mg/dl) was not statistically significant. Serum albumin remained normal (3.97 +/- 0.46 to 4.22 +/- 0.36 g/dl). Nine patients had a repeat liver biopsy after 1 yr of methotrexate therapy. Six of the nine showed histologic improvement with a reduction in inflammation. The other three liver biopsies were unchanged. Repeat cholangiograms were done in six patients. Two showed improvement. In one of the two, who had early disease, the cholangiogram became normal, and the liver biopsy was markedly improved. The other four cholangiograms showed no progression of disease. No toxicity was detected in these 10 patients. These results suggest that low-dose oral methotrexate therapy is effective in primary sclerosing cholangitis if treatment is begun before signs of portal hypertension or liver failure occur. 
Molecular basis for elliptocytosis associated with glycophorin C and D deficiency in the Leach phenotype. Glycophorin C (GPC) and glycophorin D (GPD) are highly glycosylated integral membrane proteins of human erythrocytes encoded by the same gene and associated with expression of Gerbich blood group system antigens. GPC/D deficiency (the Leach phenotype) is a rare condition usually found after identification of Gerbich blood group system antibodies in persons undergoing prenatal or pretransfusion evaluation. In all cases, the Leach phenotype has been associated with elliptocytosis. Characterization of the molecular basis of this phenotype in three previously uninvestigated families has shown that the most common genetic basis of GPC/D deficiency is deletion of exons 3 and 4 of the GPC gene. However, in one family, the Leach phenotype appeared due to a deletion of one nucleotide in exon 3, causing a frameshift mutation in the messenger RNA and premature generation of a stop codon. The GPC and GPD protein sequences are therefore interrupted in the extracellular domain and probably intracellularly degraded. 
A prospective evaluation of elevated serum theophylline concentrations to determine if high concentrations are predictable. PURPOSE: To evaluate prospectively whether serum theophylline concentrations of 25 mg/L and greater were predictable (and presumably preventable) by use of basic pharmacokinetic calculations. DESIGN: Prospective study. PATIENTS: Fifty-five patients with a serum theophylline concentration of at least 25.0 mg/L were evaluated initially and if subsequent elevated theophylline concentrations occurred. INTERVENTIONS: The predicted steady-state serum theophylline concentration was calculated from the dosage rate divided by the predicted clearance to determine how many elevated concentrations (greater than 20 mg/L) were predictable. Predicted clearances were 0.04 L/kg/hour for normal subjects less than 70 years of age and 0.02 L/kg/hour for patients with congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or liver disease. Estimated clearances were determined and compared with predicted clearances. If patients did not have steady-state concentrations, additional calculations were made. MAIN RESULTS: From 6,368 consecutive theophylline determinations, 69 (1.08%) samples from 55 patients were 25 mg/L or higher. Predictably high concentrations occurred in 23 of 33 (69.7%) fully evaluable cases. These concentrations occurred because of a failure to consider decreased elimination clearance from congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or hepatic disease. Five fatalities occurred, and in two cases, theophylline appeared to contribute to the patient's death. Three other patients experienced syncope. The predicted elimination clearance of theophylline of 0.02 L/kg/hour was too high in eight patients over 70 years old with cardiac or pulmonary disease. Nursing and pharmacy oversights were identified as three patients were given two theophylline products simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Most elevated theophylline concentrations are predictable (and preventable) by basic pharmacokinetic calculations. Patients experiencing elevated theophylline concentrations often had comorbid conditions and were greater than 60 years of age. The dosage rate of theophylline (mg/hour) can be estimated from predicted clearance (L/kg/hour) times desired steady-state serum concentration (mg/L). 
Perineal excision of the rectum for prolapse in the elderly. A perineal operation is described for the treatment of rectal prolapse. The surgery improves functional outcome by correcting the anatomical anomalies associated with the condition. In 17 elderly women, there was one perioperative death and one recurrence. At a median follow-up of 24 months, 13 patients were able to control solid stool and three were profoundly incontinent. The operation may be an alternative to the more invasive abdominal procedures for the treatment of the majority of patients with prolapse. 
Primary pulmonary hypertension. Its association with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Four patients with primary pulmonary hypertension, microangiopathic hemolysis, and thrombocytopenia were seen at the Charleston (WVa) Area Medical Center between 1983 and 1988. Characteristic laboratory and clinical features of these patients were the following: mild anemia, reticulocytosis, low serum haptoglobin value, microangiopathic red blood cell changes on peripheral blood smear, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, normal clotting studies (ie, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen), negative direct Coombs' test, negative glucose water test, normal serum urea nitrogen and creatinine levels, lack of improvement of hemolysis and thrombocytopenia in response to vasodilators or calcium channel blockers, and severe plexiform lesions in the pulmonary vasculature with fibrin deposition at autopsy. The hemolysis and thrombocytopenia probably developed as a result of flow through the fibrin deposition in the plexiform lesions in the pulmonary circulation and subsequent shearing of red blood cells and platelets. 
Pharmacokinetics of esmolol in children. The pharmacokinetics and concentration-response relationships of intravenous esmolol were investigated in 20 children undergoing indicated cardiac electrophysiologic testing. A loading dose of 600 micrograms/kg was infused for 2 minutes. An infusion of esmolol was initiated and dosage was titrated until beta-blockade occurred. Serial esmolol blood samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis of the data revealed the following parameter estimates (mean +/- SD): volume of distribution at steady state, 2.0 +/- 1.4 L/kg; total body clearance, 321.2 +/- 238.8 ml/kg/min; and terminal elimination half-life, 4.5 +/- 2.1 minutes. There was a significant correlation between mean esmolol concentrations and mean percentage of reductions of mean arterial pressures and heart rates at each sample time (p less than 0.001). The doses of esmolol required for beta-blockade (mean +/- SD, 535 +/- 180 micrograms/kg/min) in children were considerably higher than those typically used in adults. Esmolol should prove useful in children in the acute management of cardiac arrhythmias and hypertension. 
Activity of esorubicin in recurrent malignant lymphoma: a Southwest Oncology Group study. A phase II trial of esorubicin (4' deoxydoxorubicin) was conducted by the Southwest Oncology Group in 88 assessable patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and Hodgkin's disease (HD) at the time of first relapse. Esorubicin was administered at two dose levels: 25 mg/m2 for patients at risk for excessive myelosuppression, and at 30 mg/m2 for all others at 21-day intervals. Overall, 33 of 88 patients (38%) responded to treatment including three complete remissions (CRs; 3%) and 30 partial remissions (PRs; 34%), with the median duration of response lasting 6.2 months. Response rates did not differ significantly by histologic subtype: 31% of 26 patients with favorable NHL, 33% of 43 patients with unfavorable NHL, and 58% of 19 patients with HD. Twelve of 33 responding patients (36%) had relatively durable remissions lasting from 1 to more than 4 years. Leukopenia (less than 3,000 cells per microliter) was seen in 65 of 88 patients (74%) and was severe (less than 1,000 cells per microliter) in 20 of 88 patients (23%). Clinical signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure were not seen and the ejection fraction (EF) fell 10% to 20% in three patients. Esorubicin is an active agent in patients with NHL or HD at the time of first relapse. 
Underdiagnosis and poor documentation of acute confusional states in elderly hip fracture patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of diagnosis and documentation of acute confusional states (ACS) in the medical records of patients with hip fracture. DESIGN: The diagnosis of ACS in two prospective clinical studies was compared to its diagnosis in the medical records of the same patients on the same hospitalization. In order to determine if the simultaneous prospective study influences the diagnostic and documentary practices evidenced in the medical records, a further comparison was done by reviewing medical records of two series of patients seen some years prior to the prospective studies. SETTING: Patients with femoral neck fractures treated at a department of orthopedic surgery in a university hospital and one retrospective control sample from a department of general surgery in a county hospital. SUBJECTS: Two prospective samples of patients 65 years and older treated for femoral neck fractures (n = 111 and n = 57, respectively) and two earlier retrospective samples (n = 66 and n = 68, respectively). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All comparisons showed that both physicians and nurses diagnosed ACS unsatisfactorily and documented the patients' mental status poorly. The analysis of the two retrospective medical record control samples gave the same results. Neither the physicians nor the nurses used any kind of diagnostic instrument to detect cognitive disorders in the patients. CONCLUSIONS: ACS is a common and severe complication in elderly people treated for femoral neck fractures. Acute confusional states have, by definition, one or more causes that can often be identified and treated. Poor assessment and documentation is a threat to the patients as a correct diagnosis of ACS is a prerequisite for further assessment of its underlying causes and the consequent necessary medical and nursing care. 
Preventability of emergent hospital readmission To determine whether emergent readmissions within 30 days of discharge are potentially preventable, we prospectively studied all readmissions to the medical service of a university teaching hospital during a 4-month period. The 327 readmissions, including 42 patients who were readmitted more than once during the study period, accounted for 12% of medical admissions. Nearly 75% of readmissions were due to previously diagnosed medical conditions; complications of drugs or therapeutic procedures caused 29%, and patient compliance contributed to 11%. Three reviewers judged 28 (9%) readmissions to be potentially preventable. These 28 readmissions constituted 1% of all admissions to the medical service and did not result in any fatalities, indicating that the quality of care was generally very good. One third of the potentially preventable readmissions were thought to be related to medical system failures, one third to an unfulfilled hope that the patient would improve after discharge, and one third to other suboptimal judgements in evaluation or treatment. Of the 28 potentially preventable readmissions, 89% occurred within 10 days of discharge. We conclude that potentially preventable readmissions would nearly always be detected by review of readmissions within 10 days of discharge and that many may be amenable to systematic interventions such as standardized predischarge assessment and better coordination of post-discharge follow-up. 
Role of lymphadenectomy in renal cell carcinoma. A hilar or limited lymph node dissection will not remove the primary lymphatic drainage area of either kidney. For a lymphadenectomy to have a therapeutic benefit, an extended dissection is required, particularly for right-sided tumors. An extended lymphadenectomy may not be justified in all patients with renal cell carcinoma, particularly those with small tumors (who rarely have lymphatic disease) or grossly positive nodes (who have a high risk of existing distant metastases). For some patients with T3 or V+ tumors and palpably normal retroperitoneal nodes, an extended nodal dissection may resect microscopically involved nodes and result in an improved survival rate. This hypothesis will not be tested appropriately until a randomized controlled study is performed. 
Torsion dystonia genes in two populations confined to a small region on chromosome 9q32-34. Idiopathic torsion dystonia (ITD) is characterized by sustained, involuntary muscle contractions, frequently causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. Most familial forms of ITD display autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance. Linkage analysis has been previously used to localize a dystonia gene to the 9q32-34 region in a large non-Jewish family and in a group of Ashkenazi Jewish families. Utilizing GT repeat polymorphisms from this region, here we demonstrate that the gene causing dystonia in Ashkenazi Jews can be localized to the 11-cM interval between AK1 and D9S10. Linkage analysis in the non-Jewish family is also consistent with occurrence of the gene in this region, although positive lod scores extend over a greater than 20-cM interval in that family. These results set the stage for positional cloning of the dystonia gene. Currently there are no known candidate genes in this region. 
Prophylaxis of atrial fibrillation with magnesium sulfate after coronary artery bypass grafting. Ninety-nine consecutive consenting patients were prospectively entered into a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of postoperative magnesium therapy on the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias after elective coronary artery bypass grafting. No patient had documented or suspected arrhythmias preoperatively. Forty-nine patients received 178 mEq of magnesium given over the first 4 postoperative days, and 50 patients received only placebo. The clinical characteristics of both groups were similar. The preoperative mean serum magnesium concentration was similar in both study (1.90 mEq/L) and placebo (1.90 mEq/L) groups. The mean postoperative serum magnesium concentration in study patients was significantly elevated over postoperative days 1 through 4 when compared with preoperative levels (p less than 0.001). The postoperative mean serum magnesium concentration in control patients declined and remained significantly depressed through postoperative day 3 (p less than 0.001), but increased to preoperative levels by postoperative day 4. The mean serum magnesium concentration was significantly greater in the study patients as compared with the control patients over postoperative days 1 through 4 (p less than 0.001). Although there was no significant difference between groups with respect to episodes of ventricular arrhythmias, there was a significant decrease in the number of episodes of atrial fibrillation in the group receiving magnesium therapy (p less than 0.02). There were no recognized adverse effects of magnesium therapy. Prophylactic magnesium administration seems to lessen the incidence and severity of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting. 
U-78517F: a potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation with activity in experimental brain injury and ischemia. U-78517F (2-[4-[2,6-di-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-4-pyridinyl)-1-piperazinyl] methyl]-3,4-dihydro-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-2H-1-benzopyran-6-ol, dihydrochloride), which combines the antioxidant ring portion of alpha-tocopherol together with the amine of the previously described 21-aminosteroids (e.g., U-74006F), is a novel inhibitor of iron-catalyzed lipid peroxidation. U-78517F was found to have a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.6 microM against 200 microM ferrous chloride-initiated lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates, compared to 8 microM for U-74006F, 28 microM for alpha-tocopherol and 43 microM for the ring portion of alpha-tocopherol (i.e., trolox). Both stereoisomers of the racemic U-78517F proved to be equally active antioxidants. Against lipid peroxidation initiated by xanthine/xanthine oxidase, U-78517F was even more potent, with an IC50 of 0.01 microM. U-78517F was also observed to protect cultured mouse spinal neurons against iron-induced damage, with an IC50 of approximately 0.5 microM. When administered to male CF-1 mice i.v. at 5 min after a severe concussive head injury. U-78517F produced a dose-related improvement in the 1-hr neurological recovery. The minimum effective i.v. dose was 1.0 micrograms/kg. Measurement of U-78517 concentrations in the brains of mice after administration of a 10-mg/kg i.v. dose revealed effective antioxidant levels for as long as 2 hr. Evidence of an in vivo antioxidant action was provided by the attenuation of iron-induced blood-brain barrier disruption (i.e., Evans' blue extravasation) in rats pretreated with U-78517F. 
5-HT2 receptor antagonists and migraine therapy. 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of migraine, and several drugs with potent 5-HT2 receptor blocking activity (methysergide, pizotifen, cyproheptadine and mianserin) have been recognized as being clinically effective in migraine prophylaxis, although the selective 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (the principal agent used to identify 5-HT2 receptor-mediated actions) seems to be ineffective in migraine. Pizotifen is the most widely used 5-HT2 receptor antagonist in migraine prophylaxis, because of its superior efficacy compared with cyproheptadine, and because the incidence and severity of adverse effects with pizotifen is lower compared with methysergide and mianserin. These agents have additional antagonistic effects at histamine H1, muscarinic cholinergic, alpha 1-adrenergic, alpha 2-adrenergic and dopamine receptors, but drugs which are selective for these non-5-HT receptors appear to be of no benefit in migraine. Actions mediated by 5-HT2 receptors which could be of relevance to migraine comprise cranial vasoconstriction, increased cranial capillary permeability and platelet aggregation, and some central nervous system effects and neuroendocrine functions. Although pizotifen, cyproheptadine and mianserin are considered to be relatively specific for 5-HT2 receptors, these agents and methysergide all share a high affinity for 5-HT1C binding sites; ketanserin, however, has little affinity for these sites, thus activation of 5-HT1C receptors may be an important step in the pathogenesis of migraine. It is not yet known which 5-HT1C receptor-mediated actions of 5-HT are relevant to migraine, but some behavioural actions and cranial vasodilatation via release of endothelium-derived relaxing factor may be involved. 
Early gastric cancer: a clinicopathologic study. We report our experience, between 1973 and 1989 of 302 patients with gastric cancer in a Dutch general hospital. In 144 (47.7%) of them gastric resection was performed. Twenty-eight patients had early gastric cancer (EGC) (9.3% of the entire series and 19.4% of the resected specimens). Multicentricity of EGC was noted in 3 patients (10.7%). The incidence of EGC decreased slightly during consecutive 8-year intervals. There were 16 men and 12 women (mean age 64 and 66 years, respectively). Standard biphasic contrast radiographic studies of the upper gastrointestinal tract diagnosed or suggested malignancy in all but one patient. Endoscopy with directed biopsy diagnosed malignancy in all patients. Twenty-one lesions (67.7%) were localized to the antral region. Type IIc was most frequent (38.7%). There were 21 intestinal-type and 10 diffuse-type EGC by the Lauren classification. The incidence of intestinal-type EGC decreased during two consecutive 8-year periods. All type I and IIa lesions were of the intestinal type, whereas all diffuse-type EGCs were either type IIc or III. Lymph node metastasis was observed in 9.7% of the lesions. The incidence of lymph node metastasis increased from 0% in mucosal cancer to 20% in submucosal cancer. The overall 5-year survival rate was 91.3%: (diffuse type 100% and intestinal type 85.7%). The 5-year survival rate was 100% in mucosal cancer and 81.8% in submucosal cancer. 
Radiation therapy as local treatment in Ewing's sarcoma. Results of the Cooperative Ewing's Sarcoma Studies CESS 81 and CESS 86. The Cooperative Ewing's Sarcoma Studies, CESS 81 and CESS 86, are multiinstitutional trials with more than 80 participating institutions from Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, and Switzerland. Treatment consists of four courses of multiagent chemotherapy and local therapy. Local therapy was not randomized and was either radical surgery or resection plus postoperative irradiation or definitive radiation therapy. Here results according to local therapy have been analyzed for 93 protocol patients with localized Ewing's sarcoma (ES) who have been recruited in CESS 81 from January 1981 to February 1985 and 122 protocol patients recruited in CESS 86 from January 1986 to November 1989. The 3-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 55% in CESS 81 and 62% in CESS 86. In CESS 81, the RFS was better for surgically treated than for irradiated patients. In this study there was an extremely high incidence of local failures (50%) after definitive irradiation. In CESS 86, however, the results after radiation therapy have been improved markedly (3-year RFS 67% after radiation therapy, 65% after surgery, and 62% after resection plus irradiation). Possible explanations for the improvement of radiotherapeutic results are as follows: selections for patients for radiation therapy, start of local therapy, and quality of radiation therapy. In CESS 86, irradiated patients were randomized to receive either conventionally fractionated irradiation with less intense chemotherapy or hyperfractionated irradiation with simultaneous chemotherapy. There was no difference in treatment results at the time of analysis. The authors conclude that selection of patients for local treatment modalities and quality of treatment performance has an impact on local and overall treatment results in ES. 
Myointimal hyperplasia as a result of balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy. The balloon-tipped embolectomy catheter is widely utilized in the treatment of arterial thromboemboli, significantly improving mortality and limb salvage rates. However, early and late complications related to catheter-tip injury and balloon trauma continue to occur and compromise the results of surgical intervention. Myointimal hyperplasia is an example of an unusual late complication induced by balloon-related arterial wall trauma. Myointimal hyperplasia is a commonly recognized healing response of the arterial wall to endothelial injury but is rarely reported after balloon-catheter thromboembolectomy. The extensive nature of the injury increases the incidence of limb loss. The pathophysiologic nature of this process is reviewed, and pertinent structural details such as intimal thickening and disruption of the internal elastic lamina are presented. The pathogenesis of myointimal hyperplasia suggests guidelines for catheter use during embolectomy that may further reduce the incidence of this unusual complication. 
Effects of late administration of tissue-type plasminogen activator on left ventricular remodeling and function after myocardial infarction. To evaluate the effects of late thrombolysis on left ventricular volume and function in acute myocardial infarction, two-dimensional echocardiography and radionuclide angiography were performed before discharge and after 1 year of follow-up study in 34 patients with acute anterior myocardial infarction. Of these, 10 admitted to the coronary care unit within 4 h from the onset of symptoms were treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) (Group A) and 24 admitted between 4 and 8 h after onset were randomly assigned to receive either rt-PA (Group B, n = 12) or conventional therapy (Group C, n = 12). Seven to 10 days after admission, all patients underwent cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography. Patency of the infarct-related vessel was 70% in Group A, 66% in Group B and 33% in Group C and the average Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) coronary perfusion grade was 1.9 +/- 0.8 for Group A, 1.6 +/- 1.0 for Group B and 0.84 +/- 0.95 for Group C (Group A versus Group C p less than 0.01; Group B versus Group C p less than 0.05). At predischarge evaluation, mean left ventricular end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes were higher in Group C than in Group B (p less than 0.001 and 0.05, respectively) and Group A (p less than 0.005 for both); mean left ventricular ejection fraction at rest was lower in Group C than in Group B and Group A (p less than 0.05 for both). At 1 year follow-up study, end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes remained higher in Group C than in Group B (p less than 0.05 for both) and Group A (p less than 0.005 for end-systolic volume and p less than 0.001 for end-diastolic volume); ejection fraction at rest was lower in Group C than in Groups A and B (p less than 0.05 for both); during exercise, it increased more in Group A than in Group C (p less than 0.01). Comparison of data obtained before discharge and at the 1 year follow-up study revealed a significant differences in end-systolic volume (p less than 0.05) in Group C patients and in end-diastolic volume in patients in Groups B (p less than 0.05) and C (p less than 0.001). The beneficial effect of late thrombolysis with rt-PA may be related to a reduction in myocardial expansion and thus to a favorable influence on postinfarction left ventricular remodeling. 
Animal models of fulminant hepatic failure. The six requirements for a satisfactory animal model of fulminant hepatic failure are reversibility, reproducibility, death from liver failure, a therapeutic window, a large animal model, and minimal hazard to personnel. Different models may be required to evaluate the various types of liver failure seen in man. The available models include surgical anheptic and devascularization procedures, as well as hepatotoxic drug administration using agents such as carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, or galactosamine. Currently combined surgical and drug models appear to provide the best model but the search for the ideal models continues. 
Inflammatory pseudotumor in childhood. A diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. We describe a case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the lower abdomen in a young child. The urinary bladder and abdominal wall were involved, and the pseudotumor simulated a malignant sarcomatous tumor. Surgical excision was undertaken, and the outcome was favorable. This rare tumor simulates a true neoplasm both clinically and morphologically and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Our case and a review of the literature indicate that an effort should be made to perform a radical excision. This is considered the treatment of choice except if it requires a mutilating procedure. 
Late-infantile type galactosialidosis. Histopathology of the retina and optic nerve. We studied histopathologic findings from the retina and optic nerve of a patient with the late-infantile type of galactosialidosis and related them to clinical features of the condition. Markedly fewer ganglion cells were evident histopathologically using light microscopy. Results of histochemical studies demonstrated abnormal accumulation of lipid and proteinaceous material in the residual swollen ganglion cells. Marked loss of myelinated nerve fibers and thickening of the pial septum were also observed in the optic nerve. Both retinal ganglion cells and amacrine cells had intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies, but none were found in the optic nerve. These findings suggested that optic atrophy was induced by axonal wallerian degeneration secondary to retinal ganglion cell death. Although the fundus showed advanced optic nerve atrophy, a cherry red spot was not evident, possibly because of the marked decrease in ganglion cells in this case. 
Primary surgical treatment for carcinoma of the larynx: influence of the local invasion. In the period from 1976 to 1988, 417 patients with supraglottic carcinoma of the larynx were treated by primary surgery. Infiltration of the pre-epiglottic space was found in 11.99 per cent (50/417) of the patients. Carcinomas of the infrahyoid epiglottis spread to this space more frequently--14.24 per cent (44/309), than those of suprahyoid localization--5.55 per cent (6/108). Tumour invasion of the pre-epiglottic space is a relative contra-indication for reconstructive surgery. Partial conservation operations were performed on 32 per cent (16/50) of patients with invasion of the pre-epiglottic space. The remaining patients had a total laryngectomy. Infiltration of the paraglottic space intra-operatively was found in 2.4 per cent (10/417) of patients and all of these tumours were from the infrahyoid localization. Spread of tumours to this site is an indication for radical surgery and laryngectomy was performed on 80 per cent (8/10) of patients. 
The effect of prostaglandin E1 on acute pulmonary artery hypertension during oleic acid-induced respiratory dysfunction. This study examined the general effect of intravenous PGE1 on RV Ees and effective PA elastance (EA) during acute pulmonary hypertension associated with oleic acid infusion. In eight pigs, RV end-systolic elastance was quantified with the Ees and Ea was defined with reference to the Windkessel model. Oleic acid infusion increased mean PAP and Ea. Prostaglandin E1 reduced PAP and decreased Ea. Ees did not change throughout the study. Mean arterial pressure was reduced and the pulmonary shunt was increased after PGE1 infusion. The PaO2 was reduced. Data from this study suggest that although PGE1 is effective in reducing PAP, it is not as effective in reducing RV afterload. Furthermore, PGE1 does have significant side effects such as reduction of systemic arterial pressure and an increase in pulmonary shunt. 
Alpha 1 blockers. Safe, effective treatment for hypertension. Alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agents, used alone or in combination with other medications, are efficacious in the management of hypertension. They are safe and well tolerated, and they offer unique advantages. Their mechanism of action in lowering blood pressure targets elevated peripheral vascular resistance, which is the principal hemodynamic abnormality of essential hypertension. The alpha 1 blockers maintain cardiac output and blood flow to vital organs, and they do not affect renin release. These agents have beneficial lipid and metabolic effects and can improve left ventricular hypertrophy, theoretically having a positive impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The only drug interaction identified with the alpha 1 blockers is an increased hypotensive effect when they are combined with other antihypertensive agents. A further advantage of the alpha 1 blockers is that, because of the widespread location of alpha 1 receptors, the agents offer potential benefit for a number of disease states, including benign prostatic hyperplasia. They also provide an especially useful antihypertensive choice for middle-aged and elderly patients. 
Peripheral neuropathy after chronic endoneurial ischemia. We have developed a method for producing chronic regional nerve ischemia in rats by creating proximal limb arteriovenous shunts. This procedure results in a 50 to 75% reduction in endoneurial blood flow within the distal sciatic nerve as measured by the iodoantipyrine method. Nerve conduction velocities in sciatic nerves ipsilateral to the shunt fell by 25 to 30% within 2 weeks after creation of the shunt and did not recover for up to 10 months after the procedure. Morphological studies of the ischemic nerves showed structural abnormalities at nodes of Ranvier and mild axonal atrophy. Neither segmental demyelination nor axonal degeneration were evident. These results indicate that reduced endoneurial blood flow, insufficient to cause infarction, may result in measurable functional and morphological abnormalities in peripheral nerves. 
Current status of imaging indeterminate renal masses. In 1986 Bosniak proposed a classification of cysts and cystic renal masses in an attempt to define precisely the radiologic findings for lesions not requiring further evaluation and for those that should be explored surgically in an attempt to salvage normal renal parenchyma. This classification has been extremely useful in expanding the number of patients treated conservatively. The following entities can be considered benign and require no further evaluation: the classic simple cyst (Bosniak category 1), a cyst with benign calcification (see Fig. 1A and B), a hyperdense cyst (see Fig. 2), and a cyst with thin (less than or equal to 1mm) septations (see Fig. 5A; Bosniak category 2). When any of the following features are present, further evaluation is warranted: aggressive calcifications (see Fig. 1C-E), abnormal density not fulfilling the criteria of a hyperdense cyst (see Figs. 3 and 4), or nodular septations (see Fig. 5B and C), or wall thickening (see Fig. 7; Bosniak) category 3). Small masses that cannot be characterized accurately also require further evaluation. Multiloculated masses(see Fig. 9) require surgery (Bosniak category 3). Most cases of multiple localized renal cysts can be distinguished from multiloculated masses and do not require surgery (see Fig. 10). Evaluation of cyst fluid by MR imaging has not been proved reliable in differentiating benign and malignant masses. MR imaging will become more useful when its spatial resolution equals that of CT. Masses that remain indeterminate after careful evaluation by ultrasonography and CT scanning can be evaluated additionally by angiography or cyst puncture. Management options for persistent enigmatic masses include follow-up radiologic studies, exploration, local excision, and nephrectomy. 
Stapled ileoanal anastomosis for ulcerative colitis and familial polyposis without a temporary diverting ileostomy. Between March 1989 and August 1990, we performed 21 stapled J pouch ileonal procedures (20 ulcerative colitis [UC], 1 familial polyposis [FP]) without an ileostomy in 19, of whom 13 were taking prednisone and eight underwent semi-emergent surgery for uncontrollable bleeding. During the same time, an additional four patients required a standard ileonal procedure. The results of anal manometry and clinical function were compared to 25 patients who had previously undergone mucosal stripping and a sutured J pouch ileoanal anastomoses with a temporary diverting ileostomy between October 1982 and August 1990. During this same time period, an additional 19 patients underwent an anti-peristaltic reversed J pouch and 18 an S pouch, for a total of 83 ileoanal procedures. The reversed J pouch had a lower stool frequency than a standard J pouch but had an unacceptable incidence of complications and problems with pouch emptying. The S pouch had a stool frequency similar to the standard J pouch but provided greater length in patients with a short mesentery. Stapled J pouch ileoanal patients had a better (p less than 0.02) maximum and sphincter resting pressure (46 +/- 11 versus 34 +/- 12 mmHg), fewer (p less than 0.05) night-time accidents (22% versus 68%), daytime (17% versus 55%) or night-time (28 versus 61%) spotting, or use of a protective pad at night (11% versus 42%) than nonstapled J pouch ileoanal patients. Stool frequency was similar in the two groups. All but one UC patient had residual disease at the anastomosis. Anal mucosa between the dentate line and stapled anastomosis was 1.8 +/- 1.3 cm (range, 0 to 3.5 cm). Complications in the nonstapled J pouch group included 4 pouches excised (2 for complications, 2 for excessive stool frequency), 1 pelvic abscess, 2 stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia, 1 enterocutaneous fistula after ileostomy closure, 1 ileostomy site hernia, and 2 small bowel obstructions. Of the 65 patients who underwent ileostomy closure in the entire series, 8 (12%) developed a complication requiring surgical intervention. Complications in the stapled group included 1 anastomotic leak, 1 pouch leak, and 1 pelvic abscess. Patients were managed successfully with drainage (all 3) and diverting ileostomy (1). One patient developed stenosis requiring dilation under anesthesia. The stapled J pouch ileoanal anastomosis is a simpler, safer procedure with less tension than a standard handsewn J pouch but leaves a very small cuff of residual disease. It provides significantly better stool control and may obviate the need for an ileostomy with its complications. 
Determination of the extent of lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease with color-assisted duplex sonography: comparison with angiography. Color-assisted duplex sonography combines color Doppler flow imaging with duplex sonography to rapidly survey the vasculature. Color Doppler sonography displays the motion of flowing blood on a sonogram and is used to visualize directly arterial lumen narrowing of greater than 50%. Absence of Doppler signals signifies arterial occlusion. Preangiographic triage of patients for surgical or interventional therapy requires that a rapid and accurate survey be performed of the extent of arterial disease. Color-assisted duplex sonography was applied prospectively in 17 consecutive patients with the clinical diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease who had not previously undergone angiography. Results of angiography of the femoropopliteal arteries were graded and localized in one of seven approximately equal arterial segments. These were compared with similar segmental maps made with sonography. For the detection of stenosis or occlusion in any of the 238 segments, the sensitivity was 0.88 (49/56), specificity 0.95 (173/182), and accuracy 0.93 (222/238). The average time taken to survey both limbs was 29 min. We conclude that color-assisted duplex sonography is an accurate and rapid tool for the noninvasive mapping of the extent of femoropopliteal arterial disease. 
Surgically induced cytokinetic responses in experimental rat mammary tumor models. The effect of surgical removal of "primary" tumors on the cytokinetics of local tumor remnants, secondary implants, and metastases was investigated in three different rat tumor models in the Wag/Rij rat: a slow-growing (MCR83) and a fast-growing (EMR86) hormone-dependent mammary tumor and a rapidly, but autonomously growing carcinoma (MCR86). The latter two tumors had metastatic potential. Cell kinetic studies were done using in vivo labeling with 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd). Thirty-three hours after removal of a subcutaneous MCR83 flank tumor, secondary implants showed a significant (P less than 0.05) but transient increase in the BrdUrd labeling index (LI). A more rapid and prolonged increase, lasting for at least 7 days, was observed in EMR86 lymph node and lung metastases. In both models, no effect was observed after sham surgery (consisting of opening and closing of the skin under anesthesia). Removal of MCR86 tumors (growing in the hind leg muscle) also resulted in a rapid, transient LI increase in metastases. Continuous BrdUrd labeling experiments in this tumor model did not favor the hypothesis that the LI increase predominantly resulted from an increase in the growth fraction. Moreover, in this model, the effect was related to operation trauma. A similar increase in LI, although smaller than after tumor removal, was seen after major surgical trauma in MCR83 flank tumors. These results indicate that in the rat, tumor removal and/or major surgical trauma may modulate the cytokinetics of distant metastases significantly. A study of the systemic, possibly endocrine, factors involved in the growth-stimulating effect of surgical trauma in these rat tumor models may help to assess the clinical relevance of these findings for patients with breast cancer. 
Patterns of venous insufficiency in patients with varicose veins. The nature and distribution of venous disease surrounding the development of varicose veins and its treatment is controversial. Using duplex ultrasonography, we evaluated 54 lower extremities in 32 patients with varicose veins who were symptomatic and had obvious varicose veins by clinical examination. Twenty-eight percent had greater saphenous trunk incompetence, 2% had lesser saphenous trunk incompetence, and 96% had branch disease. Deep valvular incompetence was seen in 41%, saphenofemoral junction incompetence in 46%, and incompetence of one or more perforators in 46% of the extremities. Thirty-three percent demonstrated no evidence of associated saphenofemoral junction, deep vein, or perforating vein incompetence, while 20% had concurrent saphenofemoral junction, deep vein, and perforating vein incompetence. These data support the heterogeneity of venous disease seen in patients with varicose veins and suggest that surgical therapy be directed to a patient's specific pattern of incompetence rather than routine saphenofemoral junction ligation or stripping of the greater saphenous trunk. 
Narrow duct segment distal to choledochal cyst. "Narrow segments" (or stenotic portions) of the common bile duct (CBD) distal to cysts in two patients (a 50-yr-old woman and a 25-yr-old man) with choledochal cyst (CholCyst) were studied macroscopically and histologically. The narrow segments of the ducts were patent and connected with the main pancreatic duct extraduodenally, whereas the CBD in controls were neither dilated nor stenotic, and joined the main pancreatic duct within the duodenal wall. These narrow segments were 1 cm long. In case 1, a minute orifice was found in the narrow segment of the duct macroscopically and was identified microscopically as a small duct from a pancreatic lobule. In case 2, a small pancreatic duct also joined the narrow segment of the duct. These small pancreatic ducts were derived from the ventral pancreas, based on distribution of PP-islets. Therefore, the narrow duct distal to the cyst in patients with CholCyst (or congenital biliary dilatation) was considered to be a branch of the ventral pancreatic duct. 
Retinal migraine, chorea, and retinal artery thrombosis in a patient with primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. We report the case of a patient with the unusual combination of migraine, chorea, and retinal arterial thrombosis along with laboratory evidence of autoimmunity. In the absence of systemic lupus erythematosus, the clinical manifestations suggest the presence of the primary antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. 
Clinical use of biologic response modifiers in cancer treatment: an overview. Part II. Colony-stimulating factors and interleukin-2. Colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) are hematopoietic growth hormones that stimulate the production, maturation, and function of white blood cells. The best studied are granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) and granulocyte CSF (G-CSF), both of which can be produced by recombinant DNA technology. Clinical indications for these agents include bone marrow failure secondary to administration of chemotherapeutic drugs or radiation, bone marrow transplantation, and a variety of congenital or iatrogenic neutropenias. Toxicity in usual clinical doses is mild, and consists mainly of bone pain and constitutional symptoms such as fever, headache, and myalgias. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a lymphokine that stimulates that multiplication of several types of killer cells. These cells can recognize and destroy foreign substances, such as tumors, without destroying normal cells. Major applications of IL-2 include treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, in whom the overall objective response rate is 15-30 percent, and malignant melanoma with response rates of about 18 percent. Combination therapy with other biologics and conventional cytotoxic drugs may increase IL-2's efficacy against these tumors. Toxicity is generally severe, but reversible. Hemodynamic toxicity, consisting of hypotension, edema, weight gain, and decreased renal function, is most characteristic. Suggestions are given for pharmacologic management of these and other IL-2 toxicities. 
Magnetic resonance imaging shows specific abnormalities in the MELAS syndrome. The MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) can be difficult to identify. We report MRI abnormalities that we believe are specific to this disorder in three patients with complete or partial MELAS syndrome. The patients all showed an unusual pattern on T2-weighted MRI with multifocal areas of hyperintense signal confined to the cortex of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and adjacent white matter. Some images suggested selective cortical involvement of deeper layers only. Deep white matter was relatively spared, distinguishing this from usual cerebrovascular disease or the edema after status epilepticus. Specificity of these findings is further suggested by a good correlation of these findings with the previously described unique postmortem brain pathology of MELAS. 
Electroencephalographic study of rat hyperthermic seizures. The behavior and EEG of rat hyperthermic convulsions was studied. We found that a long run of high-voltage slow waves without convulsions, high-voltage irregular activity consisting of spikes and waves with intermittent myoclonus, and rapid spike and wave bursts accompanied by generalized clonic convulsions occurred sequentially. This behavioral and EEG activity is analogous to human febrile convulsions and supports the usefulness of this model for studies of human febrile convulsions. Rats frequently showed arrest of locomotion concurrently with paroxysmal EEG theta bursts before development of generalized convulsions. We speculate that this paroxysmal activity is a type of seizure discharge. 
Long-term prognosis after partial gastrectomy for benign conditions. Survival and smoking-related death of 2633 Amsterdam postgastrectomy patients followed up since surgery between 1931 and 1960. Decreased life expectancy may occur after remote peptic ulcer surgery, but the cause of shortened survival is unclear. A 50-year follow-up study of an Amsterdam cohort of postgastrectomy patients who underwent ulcer surgery between 1931 and 1960 showed a statistically significant decrease in survival after a postoperative interval of 12 years or more compared with the general population. The shortened life expectancy mainly reflected decreased survival in men. In women, no significant difference in survival compared with the general population was observed. The excess mortality in men was predominantly due to a statistically significant increase in cancer-related deaths. Carcinoma of the lung accounted for the majority of excess mortality. No time relationship between lung cancer death and interval since surgery was observed. Thus, smoking, primarily in men who had undergone surgery for gastric ulcers, seems an important factor contributing to excess mortality and shortened life expectancy. Excess mortality due to tobacco use has also been observed in postmarketing surveillance of H2-receptor antagonists. Therefore, smoking cessation may provide the greatest improvement in the long-term prognosis of peptic ulcer patients, regardless of the treatment. 
Nonpalpable invasive breast cancer. The use of mammography has resulted in 1464 breast biopsies for nonpalpable abnormalities at the University of Virginia in the 10 years 1980 to 1989. Two hundred sixty-four cancerous lesions (18%) were found. One hundred seventy-eight of these (67%) were in situ lesions. Invasive cancer (86 of 264 lesions or 33%) forms the basis for this report. Mammographic findings leading to biopsy were a mass in 61 of 86 cases (71%), microcalcifications in 23 of 86 (27%), or both in 2 of 86 cases. Histologic subtypes were infiltrating ductal (63 of 86), infiltrating lobular (14 of 86), and other infiltrating (9 of 86). Mastectomy was performed in 71 of 86 lesions (82%), lumpectomy/radiation in 14 of 86 (16%), and lumpectomy alone in 1 of 86 lesions. Division of the tumors into size with nodal status revealed 19 of 86 lesions (22%) less than 0.5 cm with 0 of 14 positive nodes. Thirty-nine of eighty-six lesions (46%) measured 0.6 to 1.0 cm with 10 (26%) positive nodes. Twenty-eight of eighty-six lesions (32%) measured more than 1.0 cm with 8 of 28 (28%) positive nodes. Nodal status is unknown for eight patients. Overall 18 of 78 lesions (23%) had positive nodes. Median follow-up is 44 months. Disease-free survival rate is 92% (79 of 86 patients) and overall survival rate is 94% (81 of 86 patients). Six of seven recurrences occurred in node-positive patients. For those with negative or unknown nodes, the disease-free survival rate is 98% (67 of 68 patients). These findings emphasize the benefit of early detection of breast cancer through the use of mammography. 
Screening for cervical cancer by direct inspection. Since cytology-based screening programmes for cervical cancer cannot be provided on a large scale in developing countries, an alternative approach is needed. To find out whether visual inspection of the cervix is an adequate alternative, women with cytological evidence of dysplasia were followed up cytologically and colposcopically until cancer was detected, and the gross appearance of the cervix was recorded at each stage. Although only 40-50% of cancers were accompanied by abnormal-looking cervices, whereas 71% were detectable on cytology and 87% on colposcopy, visual inspection may be useful in areas where cytological screening programmes are not available. 
Mouse platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene is deleted in W19H and patch mutations on chromosome 5. The mouse W19H mutation is an x-ray-induced deletion of more than 2 centimorgans on chromosome 5 encompassing the white spotting mutation W (encoded by the Kit protooncogene), patch (Ph), and recessive lethal (l) loci. The platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene (PDGFRA) like Kit encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase. By using mouse-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids and haplotype analysis in interspecific backcross mice, mouse Pdgfra was mapped to chromosome 5 in tight linkage with Kit. Hybridization of a PDGFRA probe to DNAs from W19H/ + heterozygous mice and patch heterozygous mice, and their wild-type littermates, demonstrated deletion of Pdgfra. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that Kit and Pdgfra are linked on a 630-kilobase Mlu I DNA fragment. Thus the W19H deletion removes at least two receptor tyrosine kinases and the results suggest Pdgfra as a candidate for the Ph locus. 
Clues and pitfalls in stereotactic biopsy of the central nervous system. We present a 6-year experience on 307 stereotactic biopsy specimens of the central nervous system using Leksell's and Talairach's systems independently and either Leksell or Sedan needles. Patients with deep cerebral lesions (basal ganglia, parasellar, pineal, or third ventricle), those located in highly functional areas or those poorly defined on imaging studies, as well as candidates for brachytherapy, were selected. Smear examination during surgery was a routine procedure followed by conventional histologic methods. Ages ranged from 8 months to 81 years (mean, 33.64 years). The series comprised 258 tumors, 28 nonneoplastic cases, and 21 nondiagnostic samples. Of the 258 tumors, 179 were supratentorial, 28 were infratentorial, 36 were of the pineal area, and 15 were from sellar and suprasellar regions. Results of the histologic examination showed the following: astrocytic tumors, 148 (57.36%); oligodendroglial, 25 (9.68%); ependymal, six (2.32%); primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 17, including 14 pineoblastomas (5.45%) and three medulloblastomas (1.16%), seven lymphomas (2.71%), seven meningiomas (2.71%), four schwannomas (1.55%), eight craniopharyngiomas (3.10%), 12 germinomas (4.65%), and 20 metastases (7.78%). Nontumoral cases included six arteriovenous malformations, six pyogenic lesions, seven infarcts, two hematomas, one multiple sclerosis plaque, one Fahr, one progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, one tuberculosis, one cysticercosis, and one Chagas' encephalitis. Awareness of the cerebellar granular layer in infratentorial targets as well as glial reaction around craniopharyngiomas is essential to avoid misdiagnosis. Difficulties were basically differential diagnosis between well-differentiated astrocytomas vs glial reaction, as well as poorly differentiated neoplasms vs metastases. 
Allergic rash due to antiepileptic drugs: clinical features and management. Optimal management of allergic rash from antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is unclear. We identified 50 patients with 68 reactions (36 to one AED, 10 to two AEDs, and four to three AEDs). The AEDs implicated were carbamazepine, 30; phenobarbital (PB), 20; phenytoin, 16; ethosuximide, one; and AED combination, one. Sixty-three reactions were cutaneous eruptions, three exfoliative dermatitis, and two Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Forty-six reactions were mild (rash only), 18 moderate (systemic symptoms or other organ system involvement), and four life-threatening (all with PB). In most patients with greater than 1 reaction, the second and third reactions were not more severe than the first. Prior antibiotic allergies or nonmedication allergies were no more common than in a control group without reactions. The AED was ceased abruptly in 59 patients (22 of whom did not receive a new AED), tapered in five, and continued unchanged in four. Despite this, there was no status epilepticus (SE) during the reaction or its treatment, and no patient's seizure control deteriorated. In 40 cases, a new AED was added--16 after the reaction had resolved and 24 before total resolution. Rash recurred with the new AED in 50 and 42% respectively (NS). We conclude that, though allergic rashes to AEDs are usually mild, the rare occurrence of severe reactions indicates that the AED should be ceased. This can be done abruptly with minimal risk of SE. A new AED can be added, if necessary, prior to the resolution of the rash without increasing the risk of further reactions. 
Morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Three-hundred forty-one HBsAg-positive family members of 152 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection (47 asymptomatic carriers, 59 with chronic hepatitis, 17 with cirrhosis and 29 with hepatocellular carcinoma) were prospectively studied to determine the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the family members of patients with malignant and nonmalignant hepatitis B virus-related chronic liver diseases. Most of the family members had no history of acute hepatitis, were asymptomatic and were unaware of their carrier status. However, 5.3% had stigmata of chronic liver disease, 6% had serum ALT levels that exceeded two times the upper limit of normal and 78% of those who had biopsies had chronic hepatitis with or without cirrhosis. During a follow-up period of 12 to 90 mo (median = 39 mo), 3% had symptoms of chronic liver disease; 24% had transient, recurrent or persistent elevation in serum ALT levels, 1.4% had cirrhosis and 1% had hepatocellular carcinoma. Neither hepatocellular carcinoma in the index patient nor a previous history of hepatocellular carcinoma in the family was associated with an increase in the morbidity and mortality from chronic hepatitis B virus infection in the HBsAg-positive family members. 
Correlation of the optic disc size to glaucoma susceptibility. Previous studies have suggested that a larger optic disc size in blacks as compared with whites is related to the increased glaucoma susceptibility in blacks. In an intraindividual bilateral comparison of 245 white patients with open-angle glaucoma, the authors evaluated whether the glaucomatous optic nerve damage was greater or less in the eye with the larger optic nerve head. Highly myopic eyes were excluded. The difference in optic disc area of one eye as compared with the contralateral eye was not significantly correlated to the differences in visibility of retinal nerve fiber bundles and mean visual field defect between the two eyes. Mean perimetric loss and the retinal nerve fiber layer index were not significantly higher in the eye with the larger or smaller optic nerve head. This indicates that in whites, high myopes excluded, the susceptibility to glaucomatous optic nerve fiber loss may be independent of the optic disc size. 
Actuarial analysis of the occurrence of remissions following thymectomy for myasthenia gravis in 400 patients. The role of thymectomy in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (MG) was analysed in 400 patients affected with generalised MG operated on between 1974-83, and prospectively followed up for five years after surgery. The occurrence of stable remission (SR) (that is, complete clinical drug-free remission that remains stable for all the subsequent follow up) was the endpoint of survival analyses and the distribution of SR time (SRT, that is, the interval from thymectomy to the occurrence of SR) was assessed by actuarial and Cox multivariate analyses. SRT distribution after surgery showed a slow progressive increase of cumulative SR rate that could both be ascribed to a delayed effect of thymectomy as well as reflect the natural history of MG, itself characterised by an increasing probability of spontaneous remission with time. SRT distribution was similar after stratification for all variables studied except when patients without thymoma were stratified for the need for immunosuppressive treatment in addition to thymectomy. Patients without thymoma who did not require additional immunosuppressive therapy (n = 130) had the highest SR rate occurring in the two years after thymectomy, and differed from patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs who showed the highest SR rate five years after surgery. Actuarial analysis has therefore identified a subgroup of patients where SR, occurring in the first years after surgery, is more likely to be ascribed to thymectomy than merely reflect the natural course of the disease. 
Noninfectious colitis associated with short gut syndrome in infants. We describe noninfectious bloody diarrhea in 13 of 16 infants referred for management of short bowel syndrome and parenteral nutrition during a 33-month period. The condition was characterized by bloody, watery stools associated with carbohydrate malabsorption. Colitis occurred at a mean age of 4.2 months during periods of advancing enteral feedings of a hydrolyzed protein- or amino acid-containing formula. Sigmoidoscopy performed in nine patients revealed edema, patchy erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, and mucosal friability without ulcerations or pseudomembranes. Colonic biopsy specimens demonstrated edema and mixed hypercellularity of the lamina propria, with prominent eosinophilia. Rectal bleeding ceased if formula feedings were decreased or withheld. Of multiple medications administered, sulfasalazine seemed to improve rectal bleeding most effectively in our patients and allowed for more rapid reintroduction of enteral feedings. 
Squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal: management with combined chemo-radiation therapy. Twenty patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the anal canal received combined chemo-radiation therapy as their primary treatment. There were 18 women and two men with a mean age of 63 years (range, 34-91 years). The mean follow-up was 34 months (range, 6-62 months). Anal margin cancers and adenocarcinomas were excluded. Fourteen of 20 patients treated had a complete response. There were six local failures: three with residual disease at the end of treatment and three with recurrent disease at a later date. Of the three with residual disease, one underwent abdominoperineal resection and two received salvage therapy (one with chemo-radiation and one with radiation alone). All three patients with recurrent disease were treated with abdominoperineal resection. All six were disease free at the end of the study. Of the 14 patients with complete local response, one presented with liver metastases 19 months later. Sixteen patients (80 percent) were alive at the end of the study, and 19 patients (95 percent) had no evidence of disease. These data add support for salvage therapy in the treatment of patients with residual disease following initial chemo-radiation therapy. Salvage options for patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the anus who fail the Nigro protocol will be discussed. 
Comparison of dexamethasone and ondansetron in the prophylaxis of emesis induced by moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial was done to compare the efficacy and safety of a serotonin receptor antagonist--ondansetron--and dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of acute and delayed emesis and nausea induced by moderately emetogenic non-platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens. Patients were treated as outpatients and received intravenous ondansetron 4 mg or dexamethasone 8 mg before chemotherapy and oral maintenance (ondansetron 4 mg every 6 h and dexamethasone reducing from 4 mg to 1 mg 6-hourly between days 1 and 5) for 5 days. 112 patients were treated (38 men, 73 women, 1 with no gender recorded; age range 30-73 years) and 100 were evaluable for cross-over analysis. Patients taking ondansetron or dexamethasone reported no significant difference in complete and major control of acute (83% vs 79%, p = 0.46) or delayed (82% vs 88%, p = 0.214) emesis (vomiting plus retches). Significantly more patients on dexamethasone (87%) than on ondansetron (72%) reported control of delayed nausea (days 2-5) (p = 0.003). Both drugs were well tolerated with no significant difference in the number of adverse events, and this is reflected by similar patient preference for ondansetron (40%) and dexamethasone (30%) (p = 0.244). Both drugs offer adequate out-patient control of chemotherapy-induced emesis; however, dexamethasone has an advantage in the control of delayed nausea, and also in terms of cost and resource allocation. 
Pediatric heart transplantation at Stanford: results of a 15-year experience. The long-term results of pediatric heart transplantation were evaluated in 53 patients, aged 0.25 to 18.94 years, who received transplants at Stanford University Medical Center between 1974 and 1989. Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (68%), congenital heart disease (21%), endocardial fibroelastosis (8%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (3%). Immunosuppression was achieved with combinations of cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Thirty-seven of 42 recipients leaving the hospital after transplantation were alive and in New York Heart Association class I at study's end. Cumulative survival was 79% at 1 year, 76% at 3 years, and 69% at 5 years. Fourteen recipients have survived more than 5 years (5.1 to 12.4 years). Hospital readmission for illness has been infrequent, decreasing from 6.8 days to 0.9 days per year over 5 years. Eleven patients have required no rehospitalization. Posttransplant deaths were due to infection (19%), rejection (4%), pulmonary hypertension (4%), coronary artery disease (2%), and lymphoproliferative disease (2%). Retransplantation was required for intractable rejection in 4 patients and advanced coronary artery disease in 2. Hypertension and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were common in individuals receiving cyclosporine. Growth was often impaired in prepubertal children receiving daily prednisone. Based on this 15-year experience, it is concluded that heart transplantation represents a reasonable alternative for selected young patients with end-stage cardiac disease. 
Evaluation of three oral dosages of ondansetron in the prevention of nausea and emesis associated with cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin chemotherapy. We assessed the antiemetic efficacy and safety of three different oral doses of ondansetron (GR 38032F), a novel serotonin type-3 receptor antagonist, in three consecutive series of 20 breast cancer patients receiving cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy for the first time. Patients received oral doses of 8 mg, 4 mg, or 1 mg of ondansetron three times daily for 2 days, with the first dose given 30 minutes before the cyclophosphamide infusion. We then evaluated the efficacy of a conventional antiemetic regimen of intravenous lorazepam, metoclopramide, and diphenhydramine given before chemotherapy and 10 mg prochlorperazine given orally twice on study day 1 and three times on study day 2 in a fourth series of 20 patients with comparable characteristics. The number of emetic episodes, assessment of nausea and appetite, and adverse events were recorded throughout the 2-day study period. Pretreatment and posttreatment clinical laboratory data were also collected. No emesis was observed during the 2-day study period in 17 (85%), 13 (65%), and 11 (55%) patients treated with 8-mg, 4-mg, and 1-mg ondansetron doses, respectively, and in seven (35%) patients who received conventional therapy. The incidence and intensity of nausea were lower with increasing doses of ondansetron and were lower than in the conventional group. Ondansetron-related side effects were generally mild and reversible and did not appear to increase in a dose-dependent manner. These effects included headache, stomach cramps, diarrhea, fatigue, and elevated serum transaminase concentrations. One patient who received three 1 mg doses of ondansetron experienced tremors and muscle twitching. Oral ondansetron is an effective and safe antiemetic for patients receiving noncisplatin cyclophosphamide-doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and its antiemetic activity appears to be dose-related. 
Surgical cure of cardiac arrhythmia. 1969. The first surgical procedure undertaken for the intended purpose of curing a patient with recurrent tachycardia was performed by Sealy in 1968, and the report of that operation was published in The Annals of Thoracic Surgery in 1969. The first attempted accessory bundle ablation was successful, marked the beginning of cardiac arrhythmia surgery, and has set the standard against which other methods of arrhythmia control must be measured. 
Relationship of temperature pattern and serious bacterial infections in infants 4 to 8 weeks old 24 to 48 hours after antibiotic treatment. STUDY OBJECTIVE: A new management approach to selected febrile infants 4 to 8 weeks old evaluated for possible sepsis is outpatient ceftriaxone therapy, with subsequent re-evaluation 24 to 48 hours after presentation. This study assessed whether the temperature profile of such infants during the 24- to 48-hour period after treatment distinguished those with from those without serious bacterial infections (SBIs). DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive clinical study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-one febrile infants 4 to 8 weeks old. SETTING: An urban pediatric emergency department and hospital. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All infants underwent a sepsis evaluation (lumbar puncture, CBC/blood culture, and urinalysis/urine culture) and were hospitalized for at least 48 hours. Temperatures were measured on presentation and then every four hours during hospitalization. All infants received parenteral third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic therapy, and none received antipyretic medication unless fever was documented. Fever (rectal temperature of more than 38.0 C) was documented during the 24- to 48-hour period after presentation in 28 infants (17.6%)--one of a total of 18 infants (5.6%) with SBI and 27 of a total of 143 infants (19%) without SBI (alpha, more than .2: power .30). All bacterial isolates in cases of SBI were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics. All repeat blood and urine cultures that were performed in infants with bacteremia or urinary tract infections, respectively, were negative 24 hours after presentation. CONCLUSION: Infants 4 to 8 weeks old who remain febrile during the 24 to 48-hour period after presentation and initiation of parenteral antibiotic therapy are less likely to have SBI. This study did not have sufficient power for this difference to be statistically significant. 
Tolerance to somatostatin analogue in a preterm infant with islet cell dysregulation syndrome. An infant of 31 weeks' gestation presented with refractory neonatal hypoglycaemia secondary to islet cell dysregulation. Treatment was started with somatostatin analogue and his glycaemic control improved initially. Tolerance developed, however, in that the dose required to maintain control increased by a factor of 40. The infant subsequently underwent pancreatectomy. It is safe to use somatostatin analogue in a preterm infant, but tolerance to the drug rapidly develops. 
Assessing the feasibility of bronchoplastic surgery with magnetic resonance imaging. Bronchoplastic surgical techniques may allow resectional therapy for non-small cell lung carcinoma in select patients in whom preoperative pulmonary function demonstrates prohibitive risk for pneumonectomy. We report an otherwise poor candidate for pneumonectomy in whom coronal magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the potential for distal bronchial salvage. 
The evaluation of coronary bypass graft patency: direct and indirect techniques other than coronary arteriography. Patients having one or more coronary artery bypass graft operations constitute an important part of the practice of cardiac radiology. Bypass graft patency can be determined by indirect and direct methods. The indirect imaging methods include radionuclide ventriculography, thallium-201 scintigraphy, and positron emission tomography. The direct methods include conventional CT, ultrafast CT, MR imaging, digital subtraction angiography, and Doppler sonography. This review discusses the advantages and limitations of these methods and attempts to define the relative importance of each of these techniques in the evaluation of bypass graft patency. 
123I-iodoamphetamine SPECT brain imaging in alternating hemiplegia. Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is an unusual disorder characterized by early onset (occurring before 18 months of age); repeated attacks of hemiplegia involving both sides of the body; other paroxysmal phenomena, such as tonic stiffening, dystonic posturing, choreoathetoid movements, ocular motor abnormalities, and autonomic disturbances, in association with bouts of hemiplegia or occurring independently; and evidence of mental or neurologic deficits. A girl was examined because of left hemiplegia at the age of 16 months. The patient had begun exhibiting episodes of alternating hemiplegia at approximately 4 months of age. They consisted of tonic stiffening and dystonia of the right or left extremities, lasting from 30 min to several hours and followed by residual hemiparesis. They were invariably accompanied by ocular motor abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and angiography all were normal. Single proton emission computed tomography brain images during an acute episode of right hemiplegia demonstrated hypoperfusion of the left cerebral hemisphere. Following improvement of the hemiplegia, the patient was re-evaluated. The uptake of the radiotracer in the left hemisphere was increased. The scan did not demonstrate significant asymmetry in cerebral perfusion. 
Prolonged lumbar spinal drainage after the resection of tumors of the skull base: a cautionary note. A combined transcranial and facial approach was used for an en bloc resection of a malignant angiosarcoma of the ethmoid sinuses. The patient awoke neurologically intact and was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit. A lumbar subarachnoid drain was placed for the continuous removal of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately 36 hours after surgery, she deteriorated neurologically and demonstrated bilateral extensor posturing to painful stimuli. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated obliteration of the basal cisterns indicative of transtentorial herniation and a small amount of extradural air. Eight hours after the lumbar drain was turned off, the patient had recovered completely. We propose that the patient manifested transtentorial herniation caused by a pressure gradient between the supratentorial and lumbar cistern compartments brought on by the continuous removal of CSF from the lumbar subarachnoid space. We suggest that ventricular drainage should be considered for these cases rather than lumbar drainage. This offers the same advantage of removing the CSF and maintaining low-to-normal intracranial pressure without the risk of transtentorial herniation. 
Prevalence of risk factors in men with premature coronary artery disease. The prevalence of modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol greater than or equal to 160 mg/dl and high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol less than 35 mg/dl) was determined in 321 men less than 60 years of age (mean +/- standard deviation 50 +/- 7) with premature coronary artery disease (CAD) documented at coronary angiography. The prevalence of these risk factors was markedly different than in the Framingham Offspring Study population, used here as a comparison group. In the patients with CAD, only 3% had no risk factor (other than male sex), compared with 31% in the Framingham Offspring Study subjects. Most patients with CAD (97%) had greater than or equal to 1 additional risk factor. When the patients with CAD were divided by age groups (40 to 49 years [n = 109], 50 to 59 [n = 191]), no significant differences were observed in the prevalence of risk factors between the young and older patients. The prevalence of systemic hypertension (41 vs 19%, p less than 0.001), diabetes mellitus (12 vs 1.1%, p less than 0.001), cigarette smoking (67 vs 28%, p less than 0.001) and HDL cholesterol less than 35 mg/dl (63 vs 19%, p less than 0.001) was markedly higher in the patients with CAD than in Framingham Offspring Study subjects, whereas the prevalence of LDL cholesterol greater than or equal to 160 mg/dl was not significantly different between patients with CAD and Framingham Offspring Study subjects (26 vs 26%). 
Reduced postoperative hospitalization after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. An initial experience of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 50 consecutive patients was reviewed and the results compared with those of a group of 25 patients who underwent laparotomy cholecystectomy during the 3 months before the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed in 44 of 50 consecutive patients in whom it was attempted. When compared with laparotomy, laparoscopy cholecystectomy was associated with longer mean (s.d.) anaesthesia, 155 (61) min versus 102 (31) min (P less than 0.001), shorter mean postoperative hospital stay, 3.5 (1.5) versus 8.8 (3.2) days (P less than 0.001), and reduced mean cost, pounds 895 (376) versus pounds 2210 (822) (P less than 0.001). Perioperative morbidity was also reduced following laparoscopy cholecystectomy (9 per cent versus 16 per cent) but not significantly so. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe, effective procedure which completely removes the gallbladder. It significantly reduces hospital stay, is cosmetically satisfactory and has financial benefits. We suggest that this technique be considered for all patients having cholecystectomy. 
The scimitar syndrome. The clinical spectrum of the scimitar syndrome ranges from severely ill infants to asymptomatic adults. The true incidence of the disorder is unknown because the syndrome may remain undetected in asymptomatic patients until a chest roentgenogram is obtained. We have presented the contrasting clinical experiences of two adult women, one with few symptoms and a benign course, and the other with exacerbation of her asthma from recurrent upper respiratory tract infections originating in the lower lobe of her right lung. Improvement resulted from surgical resection of this congenitally abnormal, bronchiectatic segment of lung. 
Use of modified diets in nursing homes. Randomly chosen medical charts of 212 elderly subjects in 11 nursing homes were reviewed to determine which characteristics of the subjects were most closely associated with their diet prescriptions. The chart reviews indicated that 104 (49.0%) of the 212 subjects had some type of nutrient-modified diet prescription. Eight patients who were tube fed were not included in subsequent analyses. Sodium restriction was the most common modification (60 [29.4%] of the remaining 204 patients) and calorie-controlled diets were also common (52 [25.5%] of the patients). Of the 55 patients with hypertension, 31 (56.4%) had no sodium restriction. Only 10% of all low-sodium diets limited sodium to 2 g per day. Of the 38 patients with diabetes, 7 (18.4%) had no prescription for calorie control, and there was no indication that increased dietary fiber was encouraged for diabetic patients. Only one of the 121 subjects with a diagnosis of coronary heart disease or atherosclerosis had a prescription for a cholesterol-lowering diet. Characteristics of the subjects not specifically related to diet or diagnosis, such as age, sex, duration of stay, and level of care, had no significant relationship to diet prescription. These findings suggest that the practitioners in our sample were not convinced of the efficacy of modified diets to control disease for most nursing home residents. 
Cationic Yersinia antigen-induced chronic allergic arthritis in rats. A model for reactive arthritis in humans. Cationic antigens are known to have considerable arthritogenic potential in experimental systems. During a systematic search for suitable, naturally occurring candidates an intracellular protein was isolated from the ribosomal pellet of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3, a bacterial strain associated with reactive arthritis in humans. The protein is highly cationic, contains two 19-kD polypeptide chains linked by a disulfide bond, and reveals a strong tendency for spontaneous aggregation. It is suggested to be a nucleic acid binding protein. We tested this antigen for its ability to induce arthritis after intra-articular challenge in preimmunized rats. An acute inflammatory phase followed by transition to chronicity was observed both by technetium-99m scintigraphy and from histology. Massive polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration of the synovium was seen early on and fibrosis and thickening of the joint capsule occurred in later stages. Control groups showed no evidence of inflammation. Western blot and ELISA analysis of unselected sera from Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3-infected patients revealed antibodies to the antigen in the majority of cases, whereas healthy individuals rarely reacted. This is the first report of a naturally occurring cationic antigen capable of inducing immunologic tissue injury; it justifies the speculation that cationic antigens from prokaryotic cells could trigger reactive arthritis in humans. 
The epidemiology of breast cancer. Table 5 presents risk factors for breast cancer generally regarded as established, together with their approximate relative risks. With the exception of age, country of birth, and a history of breast cancer in both a mother and a sister, all of the relative risks reported to date are of a relatively modest magnitude. Thus, new risk factors need to be identified and knowledge of existing risk factors refined. Factors for which the evidence of an etiologic role has mounted over the past several years, but which are not yet considered to be established, include the protective effects of parity and lactation in certain age groups and the increased risks associated with alcohol consumption and with DES exposure during pregnancy. In addition, physical activity has emerged as a factor worthy of further study. Some evidence suggests that use of oral contraceptives for several years at an early age modestly increases the risk for breast cancer diagnosed before age 35 and perhaps age 45. Use of estrogen-replacement therapy for 20 years or more has been found by a few studies to increase the risk for breast cancer in the postmenopausal years; further studies of very long-term users are needed. Also, other risks and benefits of these hormones need to be taken into account when women decide whether to use them. Surprisingly elusive has been the etiologic role of endogenous hormones, especially in view of the large number of studies that have been concerned with them. A better understanding of the role of endogenous hormones should help explain the mechanisms of action of known and suspected risk factors. Areas of high priority for further research thus include establishing with more certainty whether the risk for breast cancer is increased in any subgroups of women who use oral contraceptives and estrogen-replacement therapy and determining the etiologic roles of specific endogenous hormones. The possible risks associated with alcohol consumption and lack of physical activity need to be studied more thoroughly, and ideas about new potential risk factors are needed. Although epidemiologic studies will continue to be concerned with diet, enthusiasm for its etiologic role in women has been considerably dampened by the lack of association in many of the studies reported to date. The studies in women exposed to radiation, DES, and oral contraceptives suggest that the timing of some exposures may be critical, since the effects of these agents may mostly be limited to specific time periods of rapid breast development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Effect of massive dose vitamin A on morbidity and mortality in Indian children The effect of vitamin A supplementation on preschool child morbidity and mortality was assessed in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study around Hyderabad, India. Every six months 200,000 IU vitamin A was given to 7691 children (treatment group) whereas 8084 children received a placebo (control group). Morbidity and mortality data were collected every three months. Risk of respiratory infection was higher in children with mild xerophthalmia than in children with normal eyes. Vitamin A supplementation had no effect on morbidity status. Mortality rates were similar in the two groups; it was highest in children who did not receive either vitamin A or placebo. The findings suggest that vitamin A supplementation alone may not reduce child mortality. 
Full-field electroretinograms in patients with the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome. We examined five patients who had carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome with full-field electroretinograms. Only two of the patients showed fundus changes typical for retinitis pigmentosa, whereas abnormal electroretinograms were seen in all patients. There was no recordable rod response; however, a delay in the cone b-wave implicit time was noted. All patients had nyctalopia. These observations suggest that patients with the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome have a progressive tapetoretinal degenerative disorder of the retinitis pigmentosa type with defined alterations in the electroretinogram. 
Early coronary reperfusion blunts the procoagulant response of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and von Willebrand factor in acute myocardial infarction. The effects of early coronary recanalization on the plasma levels of two procoagulant acute phase proteins, the fastacting plasminogen activator inhibitor and von Willebrand factor, were investigated in 24 patients with myocardial infarction receiving intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) within 6 h of the onset of symptoms. Coronary angiography was performed before and 90 min after the start of rt-PA infusion. Continuous electrocardiographic recordings and 4 h plasma creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK MB) were performed over the first 24 h. Plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, von Willebrand factor and C-reactive protein were measured before rt-PA infusion, daily for the first 3 days and after 90 days. In the entire group, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity peaked at 24 h (day 1), representing a significant increase over values at all other times (p = 0.03). von Willebrand factor was higher in the first 2 days of infarction compared with after 90 days (p = 0.001). C-reactive protein peaked on day 2, with an eightfold increase over values on admission (p = 0.001). In the 16 patients with a patent infarct-related artery at 90 min, infarct size estimated by integrated 24 h CK MB, time for ST segment elevation to decrease to half-maximum and peak C-reactive protein were reduced significantly by more than twofold compared with values in the 8 patients with an occluded artery at 90 min. The patients with early recanalization also had lower plasminogen activator inhibitor activity on day 2 (p = 0.05) and day 3 (p = 0.02) and lower 0 to 72 h averaged von Willebrand factor (p = 0.01). Thus, early coronary recanalization curtails the response of plasminogen activator inhibitor activity and von Willebrand factor to myocardial infarction, most likely by reducing the extent of ischemia and necrosis and the consequent acute phase reaction. By blunting the early postinfarction procoagulant state, prompt recanalization may reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications in the first days after myocardial infarction. 
Prediction of outcome after mitral valve replacement in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation. The importance of left atrial size. BACKGROUND. The ability to predict outcome after mitral valve replacement remains limited in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation. The aims of this study were to determine the preoperative predictors of postoperative cardiac-related mortality and to assess the additive prognostic value of tests performed in such patients. METHODS AND RESULTS. Accordingly, 176 patients (mean age, 57 +/- 14 years) who underwent mitral valve replacement were followed up for 3.8 +/- 0.5 years. Four categories of variables were analyzed to predict postoperative cardiac-related mortality: clinical, laboratory, two-dimensional echocardiographic (2DE), and cardiac catheterization. There were 39 cardiac-related deaths (29 due to congestive heart failure and 10 sudden). When the four categories were analyzed separately, two clinical, one laboratory, two 2DE, and one catheterization variable best predicted postoperative death. When these six variables were examined simultaneously, only three (one clinical and two 2DE) remained significant predictors of cardiac-related mortality: presence of pulmonary rales, left atrial size, and the ratio of left ventricular wall thickness to left ventricular cavity dimension in end systole. A model based on these three variables may predict cardiac-related death with considerable accuracy. Laboratory data did not add to clinical information for predicting death. 2DE variables provided significant additional information in this regard (p less than 0.001). Further addition of catheterization variables was not useful. Prognostic value did not change significantly when 50 patients with prior mitral valve surgery or 49 patients undergoing concomitant aortic valve replacement or coronary artery bypass surgery were excluded from analysis. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that 1) measures of both left ventricular systolic function and left atrial size are equally important in predicting postoperative cardiac-related mortality in patients with symptomatic chronic mitral regurgitation undergoing mitral valve replacement; 2) left atrial size may be important because it reflects the "history" (severity and duration) of mitral regurgitation; 3) 2DE assessment of left atrial size and left ventricular function provides prognostic information that is significantly greater than that obtained from clinical and laboratory parameters alone; the addition of catheterization variables does not increase the prognostic value of the clinical and 2DE data. 
Vocal cord paralysis in the Shy-Drager syndrome. A cause of postoperative respiratory obstruction. A case is presented in which unexpected and persistent postoperative respiratory problems led to the finding of bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis and confirmed the diagnosis of the Shy-Drager syndrome. Anaesthetists should be aware that vocal cord paralysis may be a feature of this uncommon condition, and should consider the possibility of glottic obstruction as a cause of ventilatory difficulties. 
Expression of Tn, sialosyl Tn, and T antigens in human pancreas. Carbohydrate antigens representing some of the initial steps in mucin O-linked glycosylation were examined in specimens of normal pancreas, chronic pancreatitis, and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Tn antigen, recognized by Vicia villosa lectin, was expressed by all specimens of normal pancreas (acinar cells) and pancreatic cancers and all but one case of chronic pancreatitis. Sialosyl Tn antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody TKH2, was expressed in a cancer-associated fashion, being completely absent in normal pancreas but expressed by 56% of chronic pancreatitis and 97% of pancreatic cancers. T antigen, recognized by monoclonal antibody AH9-16, was expressed in 68% of normal pancreas (acinar cells), 67% of chronic pancreatitis, and 48% of pancreatic cancer tissues. These results indicate that normal acinar cells of the pancreas are capable of expressing selected carbohydrate structures associated with the initial steps of mucin glycosylation. The marked expression of sialosyl Tn compared with T antigen in pancreatic cancers suggests that with malignant transformation there is selective usage of glycosyltransferase enzymes involved in mucin oligosaccharide synthesis. 
Ventilatory dysfunction precedes pulmonary vascular changes in monocrotaline-treated rats. Rats with established monocrotaline (MCT)-induced pulmonary hypertension also exhibit a profound increase in lung resistance (RL) and a decrease in lung compliance. Because airway/lung dysfunction could precede and influence the evolution of MCT-induced pulmonary vascular disease, it is important to establish the temporal relationship between development of pulmonary hypertension and altered ventilatory function in MCT-treated rats. To resolve this issue, we segregated 47 young Sprague-Dawley rats into four groups: control (n = 13), MCT1 (n = 9), MCT2 (n = 11), and MCT3 (n = 14). Each MCT rat received a single subcutaneous injection of MCT (60 mg/kg) 1 MCT1), 2 (MCT2), or 3 (MCT3) wk before the functional study. At 1 wk after MCT, significant increases in RL and alveolar wall thickness were observed, as was a significant decrease in carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO). Medial thickness of pulmonary arteries (50-100 microns OD) and right ventricular hypertrophy were not observed until 2 and 3 wk post-MCT, respectively. Coincident with the right ventricular hypertrophy at 3 wk post-MCT were decreased DLCO and increased alveolar wall thickness and lung dry weight. Pressure-volume curves of air-filled and saline-filled lungs showed marked rightward shifts during the 1st and 2nd wk after MCT administration and then decreased at the 3rd wk. These data suggest that MCT-induced alterations in airway/lung function preceded those of pulmonary vasculature and, therefore, implicate airway/lung dysfunctions as potentially contributing to the later development of pulmonary vascular abnormalities. 
Effects of training on metabolic responses and performance capacity in Streptococcus pneumoniae infected rats. These experiments were designed to study whether endurance training prior to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in rats (N = 15 in each group) alters lethality, performance capacity, and related energy metabolism. A 5-d.wk-1, 4-wk-long pre-infection training program with gradually increasing swim time caused no protection from lethality (48% at 72 h post-inoculation), but performance capacity increased by 68% (P less than 0.01). The catabolic responses as evidenced by changes in insulin and glucagon levels were less pronounced. Mobilization of free fatty acids increased twofold (P less than 0.01), and improved ketonemic adaptation (47%, P less than 0.01) occurred with concomitant saved carcass, liver, and skeletal muscle glycogen contents (P less than 0.01). This shift from carbohydrate toward fat metabolism during exercise as a result of training was also reflected by 21% lower (P less than 0.01) blood lactate levels. It was concluded that the improved metabolic status, characterizing the trained as compared with the untrained host, is partly preserved during ongoing acute gram-positive bacterial infection. 
Monitoring of human cytomegalovirus infections and ganciclovir treatment in heart transplant recipients by determination of viremia, antigenemia, and DNAemia. Fourteen heart transplant recipients were monitored for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection based on determination of antigenemia, viremia, and DNAemia (by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL). Three patients had symptomatic primary, 10 had recurrent (3 asymptomatic), and 1 (seronegative) had no HCMV infection. Severe clinical symptoms appeared when levels of viremia/antigenemia were greater than 50 infected PMNL/2 x 10(5) cells examined. Of 200 blood samples examined, 93 (46.5%) were positive for viremia/antigenemia and DNAemia, whereas 48 (24.0%) were positive for DNAemia only; 59 (29.5%) were negative in all assays. Follow-up of HCMV infections in heart transplant recipients showed that PCR can detect viral appearance in blood 7-10 days earlier than assays for antigenemia/viremia. On the other hand, viral disappearance from blood, as assessed by PCR, occurred weeks or months later than revealed by other assays. Detection of virus by PCR only was never associated with overt HCMV-related clinical symptoms. Of the 8 symptomatic patients treated with ganiclovir, 2 became PCR-negative at the end of treatment and 1 cleared virus from blood in the following weeks, whereas 5 showed persistent or recurrent infection. 
The importance of adequate anticoagulation to prevent early thrombosis after stenting of stenosed venous bypass grafts. Stent implantation in native coronary arteries may be complicated by acute thrombosis, despite the use of stringent anticoagulation. Thrombotic occlusion of stented venous grafts may occur less frequently, possibly because of the larger caliber of these grafts. We report our experience with 46 stents (Wallstent, Medinvent, Lausanne, Switzerland) implanted in 35 lesions of 24 consecutive patients (mean age 64 years, range 43 to 75). Two overlapping stents were implanted in seven patients, and three overlapping stents were positioned in two. After implantation, activated partial thromboplastin time was maintained at two to three times the control level by intravenous administration of heparin (160 to 550 mg daily) until thrombotest values were reduced 5% to 10% by acenocoumarol. Impending thrombotic occlusion was recognized in two suboptimally anticoagulated patients: patient A after implantation of four stents and patient B after anticoagulation therapy was discontinued because of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed successfully in both patients. A third patient had a myocardial infarction on day 7 after stent implantation, in spite of adequate anticoagulation and optimal medical drug therapy. It is concluded that stringent anticoagulation therapy appears mandatory to maintain graft patency after stent implantation. 
The value of MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA-125 for discrimination between metastatic breast cancer and adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. MCA, CA 15-3, CEA and CA 125 were determined in the serum of 49 patients with metastatic breast cancer and 38 patients with metastatic adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. By using the 99th percentile of the normal value distribution as the cut-off point, the positive predictive value (PV+) was found to be 85% (95% CI 76-94) for MCA, and 71% (95% CI 61-81) for CA 15-3. When receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed, the PV+ for CA 15-3 was increased to 82% (95% CI 72-92), using 60 U ml-1 as the cut-off point. With the exception of two patients who had a slightly elevated MCA, MCA and CA 15-3 identified the same patients with breast cancer. By combining a positive MCA or CA 15-3 with a negative CEA and CA 125, further improvement of the PV+ could be achieved; 100% (95% CI 91-100). We conclude that MCA and CA 15-3 may play a useful role in discrimination between patients with metastatic breast cancer and those with adenocarcinoma of other primary sites. 
Surgical risk of hemorrhage in cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is increasingly recognized as a cause of lobar cerebral hemorrhage in normotensive elderly individuals. Isolated reports have suggested that neurosurgical intervention entails a high risk of precipitated hemorrhage. We identified 16 pathologically confirmed cases of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Fourteen of these patients presented with lobar cerebral hemorrhage. Fifteen neurosurgical procedures in eight patients included eight clot evacuations, three abscess drainage procedures, two ventriculoperitoneal shunts, one biopsy, and one lobectomy. Recurrent postoperative cerebral hemorrhage was seen in four patients at 2 days, 9 days, 6 weeks, and 10 months, but surgery was thought to have precipitated the cerebral hemorrhage in only one patient. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage also was seen in two of the eight nonoperated cases. Recurrent cerebral hemorrhage is characteristic of cerebral amyloid angiopathy, but we conclude that neurosurgical intervention, particularly evacuation of hematomas, is not associated with major risk of precipitated hemorrhage. 
Recurrent abdominal pain due to chronic appendiceal disease. Recurrent appendicitis and chronic appendicitis are the subjects of much controversy, but long-standing inflammation of the appendix and surrounding tissues has been reported in rare instances. We have described two patients, both with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, who subsequently were shown to have chronic appendiceal disease. Appendiceal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with recurrent abdominal pain. 
Gynecological malignancies, brain tumors, and familial adenomatous polyposis. The syndrome of familial adenomatous polyposis has a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations including adenomatous polyps of the colon and small bowel, adenocarcinoma of ampulla of Vater, tumors of the central nervous system, bone lesions, and various soft tissue tumors. The one common denominator is colonic polyposis. It is not known whether this phenotypic heterogeneity is due to various genotypes, or if the entire clinical spectrum is due to one genetic defect. We are reporting the association of gynecologic malignancies with familial adenomatous polyposis as an additional variant of this disease. This report is on two sisters from a family with familial polyposis coli who developed adenomatous polyposis of the colon, central nervous system tumors, and cancers of the ovary and uterus. The gynecological malignancies add another variant to this clinical syndrome. 
Early experience with mitral valve reconstruction for mitral insufficiency. Mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation has been reported to have more favorable early and late results than mitral valve replacement. From July 1985 through July 1990, 63 patients have undergone valve repair at Good Samaritan Hospital. Twenty-two men and 41 women whose ages ranged from 34 to 81 years (mean 67.9 years) were treated. Twenty-eight patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV. Twelve (19%) had undergone prior cardiac surgery. Isolated valve repair was performed in 18 patients. Valve repair was combined with coronary artery bypass grafting, other valve procedures, or aneurysm resection in the remainder (71%). Two patients (3%) died while in the hospital, and four deaths (one valve-related) occurred after discharge. Leaflet resection for ruptured chordae was done in 24 patients (38%), chordal shortening in 5 patients (8%), and leaflet transposition in 2 patients. Rigid ring annuloplasty (Carpentier) was performed in 62 patients. Eight patients required mitral valve replacement at the same operation because of unsatisfactory valve repair. Results of valve repair evaluated by echocardiography at discharge show that 48 patients (88%) are free of significant regurgitation. Follow-up to date reveals that all surviving patients who underwent valve repair have clinically improved and are stable. Four of five patients with moderate mitral regurgitation are currently asymptomatic. There have been two valve-related late failures requiring reoperation. Based on this early experience, we conclude that valve repair compared with mitral valve replacement has a low operative mortality with good early results. Continued efforts to preserve native mitral valve function in the presence of mitral regurgitation appear justified. 
Idioventricular rhythm: hypervagotonia associated with placebo. We report a case of hypervagotonia manifested by idioventricular rhythm in a healthy, athletic man who participated in a Phase I study of an investigational calcium-channel blocker. Upon breaking the study's double-blind study code, it was discovered that the subject had received placebo. We discuss this unusual finding and the implications of including athletic subjects in safety/tolerance studies. 
Cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. Incidence and mortality from a community-wide perspective, 1975 to 1988 BACKGROUND. Cardiogenic shock resulting from acute myocardial infarction is a serious complication with a high mortality rate, but little is known about whether its incidence or outcome has changed over time. As part of an ongoing population-based study of acute myocardial infarction, we examined trends over time in the incidence and mortality rate of cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction. METHODS. We studied 4762 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted to 16 hospitals in the Worcester, Massachusetts, metropolitan area between 1975 and 1988. We determined the incidence of and short-term and long-term mortality due to cardiogenic shock in each of six years during this study period. RESULTS. The incidence of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction remained relatively constant, averaging 7.5 percent. Multivariate regression analysis that controlled for variables affecting incidence revealed significant though inconsistent temporal trends in the incidence of cardiogenic shock. As compared with the risk in 1975, the adjusted relative risk (with 95 percent confidence interval) was 0.83 (0.54 to 1.28) in 1978, 0.96 (0.63 to 1.48) in 1981, 0.68 (0.42 to 1.12) in 1984, 1.16 (0.70 to 1.92) in 1986, and 1.65 (0.99 to 2.77) in 1988. The overall in-hospital mortality rate among patients with cardiogenic shock was significantly higher than that among patients without this complication (77.7 percent vs. 13.5 percent, P less than 0.001). The in-hospital mortality among the patients with shock did not improve between 1975 (73.7 percent) and 1988 (81.7 percent). Long-term survival during the 14-year follow-up period was significantly worse among patients who survived cardiogenic shock during hospitalization than among patients who did not have shock (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The results of this observational, community-wide study suggest that neither the incidence nor the prognosis of cardiogenic shock resulting from acute myocardial infarction has improved over time. Both in-hospital and long-term survival remain poor for patients with this complication. 
Preconditioning causes improved wall motion as well as smaller infarcts after transient coronary occlusion in rabbits. BACKGROUND. A brief coronary occlusion before a more prolonged occlusion results in less myocardial infarction than the longer occlusion alone. However, the effects of this preconditioning on recovery of systolic function after coronary occlusion have not been determined. METHODS AND RESULTS. Ultrasonic crystals implanted in rabbit myocardium measured segment length in the distribution of a branch of the left coronary artery that was fitted with a snare occluder. Rabbits were randomly allocated to either nonpreconditioned or preconditioned groups. Rabbits in the latter group underwent preconditioning with a 5-minute coronary occlusion followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion. Then the coronary artery was occluded for 20 minutes in all rabbits, after which it was allowed to reperfuse for 90 minutes. The hearts were then excised, and infarct size was measured by staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride. During coronary occlusion, all hearts except one demonstrated either akinesis or paradoxical bulging. Five minutes after release of the 20-minute occlusion, active shortening had returned in the preconditioned rabbits and averaged 27.9 +/- 16.6% of baseline shortening. At the same time, paradoxical lengthening persisted in nonpreconditioned rabbits (-15.5 +/- 19.8% of baseline). By the end of the 90-minute reperfusion period, segment shortening averaged 40.1 +/- 8.4% of baseline in preconditioned rabbits and only 6.2 +/- 12.0% in nonpreconditioned rabbits (p less than 0.05). Infarct size as a percentage of risk area was significantly smaller in preconditioned rabbits as well (3.0 +/- 1.6% versus 28.8 +/- 7.0%, p less than 0.002) and likely accounted for the improved shortening. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that a brief coronary occlusion before a more prolonged occlusion results in not only reduced infarct size but also significantly better recovery of systolic function. 
The use of immobilized protamine in removing heparin and preventing protamine-induced complications during extracorporeal blood circulation. Heparin, currently used in extracorporeal blood circulation procedures, may lead to hemorrhagic complications. Protamine, used for reversal of heparin-induced anticoagulation at the end of such procedures, can cause adverse hemodynamic responses. To prevent both types of complications, we have developed a reactor device containing immobilized protamine (i.e., a protamine bio-reactor) that can be placed at the distal end of the circuit, thus providing simultaneous extracorporeal heparin removal and protamine treatment. In preliminary in vivo studies involving dogs at a blood flow of 100 ml/min, the bio-reactor removed about 50% of the administered dose of heparin (i.e., 100 units/kg) in 10 min. While rapid injection of protamine in dogs anticoagulated with heparin produced a transient and significant (P less than 0.005) decreases in systemic arterial blood pressure (-39.5 +/- 9.2 mmHg), cardiac output (-1.59 +/- 0.23 L/min), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (-7.5 +/- 1.3%) and increases in pulmonary artery systolic (+12.7 +/- 4.4 mmHg) and diastolic pressures (+10.0 +/- 3.6 mmHg), the use of the protamine bio-reactor did not elicit any statistically significant change in any of the variables measured. Hemolysis was not significant, as reflected by a statistically insignificant change of the animals' red blood cell counts, hematocrits, and total hemoglobin values. In addition, hemolytic complement was found to be reduced only by 10% in animals with the protamine bio-reactor, whereas it was reduced rapidly by 20% in animals receiving intravenous protamine administration and progressively by 20% in control animals with a sham reactor that contained no protamine. Furthermore, the use of the protamine bio-reactor also significantly reduced the protamine-induced transient thrombocytopenic and granulocytopenic responses. The white blood cell counts and platelet counts decreased to 87.7 +/- 7.5 and 83.3 +/- 5.0% of baseline, respectively, in dogs with the protamine bio-reactor compared to 35.5 +/- 14.3 and 32.1 +/- 8.1% of baseline in dogs receiving intravenous protamine. The protamine bio-reactor may provide a unique means to simultaneously control both heparin- and protamine-induced complications. 
Molteno implantation for glaucoma in young patients. Seventy patients younger than 21 years of age underwent Molteno implantation for nonneovascular glaucoma. Fifty-three (76%) patients had failed angle and/or conventional filtering surgery. Final intraocular pressure less than 22 mmHg (but over 5 mmHg) was achieved in 40 (62%) of the 65 patients with at least 6-month follow-up (range, 6 to 59 months; mean +/- standard deviation, 22.7 +/- 14.1 months); however, only 22 (34%) were controlled after the initial Molteno implantation procedure, and 54 (83%) patients underwent further glaucoma and/or nonglaucoma surgical procedures. The visual acuities remained within one line of their preoperative levels or improved in 25 (68%) of the 37 patients on whom Snellen acuities were available. The most frequent complications included: tube-cornea touch (20%, transient in 3%), corneal edema (17%), retinal detachment (16%), tube block (10%), cataract (9%), chronic hypotony or phthisis (9%), pupillary or cyclitic membrane (9%), hyphema (7%), flat anterior chamber (6%), and large postoperative choroidal effusion (6%). Despite the high rates of subsequent surgical interventions and complications, Molteno implantation has been a useful approach for achieving intraocular pressure reduction in young patients with glucoma. 
Relation of upper gastrointestinal bleeding to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and aspirin: a case-control study. We conducted a case-control study in five general hospitals in the region of Antwerp, studying 161 patients (102 men, 59 women) and hospital control subjects matched for age and sex to explore the relation between drug use and upper gastrointestinal bleeding from 'erosive lesions' (peptic oesophagitis, gastric erosions, gastric ulcer(s), or duodenal ulcer(s]. There was a highly significant difference between cases and control subjects in the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, excluding aspirin) (odds ratio 7.4, p less than 0.001; 95% confidence interval odds ratio 3.7 to 14.7). There also was a significant difference in the use of aspirin (odds ratio 2.2, p = 0.025; 95% CI odds ratio 1.3 to 4.0) and a highly significant difference regarding the presence of antecedents of peptic ulcer disease (odds ratio 5.5, p less than 0.001; 95% CI odds ratio 3.2 to 9.6). There was no significant difference in the use of other drugs, paracetamol and corticosteroids in particular, nor in the use of alcohol or tobacco. The patient group using NSAIDs was older, had more women, and had a higher mortality than the group not using NSAIDs. Among patients with bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer(s), NSAID users were not more or less likely to have had symptoms of peptic ulcer disease, and had no higher frequency of multiple gastric or duodenal ulcers. The attributable risk for NSAID use was 0.30 (95% CI 0.23 to 0.37) and for aspirin use 0.14 (95% CI 0.08 to 0.20). 
Dietary protein restriction stress and adrenocortical function: evidence for transient and long-term induction of enhanced cellular function. Previous work has demonstrated that 4-week protein restriction of the domestic fowl (Gallus gallus domesticus) increases both adrenocortical cell sensitivity to ACTH and corticosteroidogenic capacity. In the present study we examined the transience (study 1) and the persistence (study 2) of this effect of protein restriction. In study 1, two strains of domestic fowl were used: a slower-growing White Leghorn strain and a faster-growing Cobb broiler strain. Cockerels (2 weeks old) were fed isocaloric diets containing either low (L; 5% or 8%) or control (C; 20%) levels of soy protein for 2 weeks, and then were either switched to the alternate diet (C-L, L-C) or maintained on the initial diet (C-C, L-L) for an additional 2 weeks. Cockerels were killed at 6 weeks of age. In study 2, White Leghorn cockerels (2 weeks old) were fed either diet for 4 weeks and then switched to or maintained on the control diet for an additional 4 weeks (i.e. C vs. restriction followed by repletion). In this study cockerels were killed at 10 weeks of age. In both studies highly enriched populations of adrenocortical cells were isolated from cockerel adrenal glands, and their steroidogenic properties (basal and maximally induced corticosterone and cAMP production; steroidogenic agent ED50 values) were evaluated in 2-h suspension incubations. In study 1, regardless of strain, the greater the length of the restriction period, the greater the magnitude of maximal cellular corticosterone production induced by ACTH; the average value for 4-week restriction (L-L) was 39.5% greater than that for 2-week restriction (L-C, C-L) and 117.5% greater than that for control (C-C). In addition, the value for restriction from 4-6 weeks of age (C-L) was 34% greater than that for restriction from 2-4 weeks of age (L-C), suggesting that the enhancement of maximal ACTH-induced corticosterone production after a 2-week restriction interval might be transient. Although there were no strain differences in the effect of protein restriction on maximal ACTH-induced corticosterone production, there were strain differences in its effect on cellular sensitivity to ACTH, as indicated by the ACTH ED50 values (the lower the ED50 value, the greater tha cellular sensitivity). With the White Leghorn strain, the greater the duration of protein restriction, the greater the adrenocortical cell sensitivity to ACTH; the sensitivity of L-L cells was 3.0 times the sensitivities of L-C and C-L cells and 4.1 times the sensitivity of C-C cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Asperger's syndrome: who is being abused? Six case histories of children referred and admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit at a tertiary referral centre because of concerns about poor functioning and possible emotional abuse are presented. On initial assessment the children appeared to be well functioning and the impression was confirmed that their emotional needs were not being met by their parents. After detailed inpatient appraisal the diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome was made in all six cases, exemplified mainly by a formal concrete way of thinking and an inability to identify and understand human emotions and relationships. The impact of the diagnosis on the parents and their consequent relationships with their child and their willingness to work with professionals is discussed. 
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and early mortality. To assess morbidity, mortality, and benefit associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy (PEG), we retrospectively studied 42 patients who had had PEG. Mortality was exceptionally high during the first 60 days after PEG (43%), and then stabilized. In nearly half of the cases (20/42) the PEG tube was removed during the first 60 days because of either death or improvement. Patients with malignancy had a significantly higher morbidity and 60-day mortality than the neurologically impaired. We concluded that patients should be carefully selected for PEG because early mortality is high; a 60-day trial of soft nasogastric feedings should be considered before PEG, and could reduce by nearly half the number of patients failing to receive long-term benefit; and patients with malignancy have significantly greater morbidity and mortality after PEG and may not receive the same advantage from the procedure. 
Localization of receptors for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in pancreatic and mammary cancer cells. Previous work showed that hamster and human pancreatic tumors but not normal pancreata exhibit low-affinity cell-membrane receptors for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH). Although the regression of experimental pancreatic cancers induced by treatment with LHRH agonists or antagonists could be explained in part by the creation of sex-steroid deficiency, direct effects mediated by LHRH receptors might also play a role. Here, we demonstrate that pancreatic tumor cells do exhibit high-affinity binding sites for LHRH, but only in their nuclei; low-affinity sites are associated with the cell membranes. These binding sites appear to be LHRH receptors since electron microscopic immunohistochemical studies show that an antibody to the LHRH receptor reacted with sites in the nucleus of pancreatic tumor cells. Immunoreactive sites in the nucleus also were found in a restricted set of normal hamster pituitary cells thought to be luteinizing hormone-secreting cells and in MXT mouse mammary tumor cells. Such nuclear receptors may be involved in the transmission of the direct action of LHRH analogues on the tumor cells, resulting in the enhancement of programmed cell death. 
Pneumonitis associated with coinfection by human herpesvirus 6 and Legionella in an immunocompetent adult. The authors report a case of pneumonitis in a young healthy man caused by coinfection with human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) and Legionella pneumophila. The patient's course was complicated by severe respiratory, renal, hepatic, and central nervous system dysfunctions, which were believed to be primarily the results of his Legionella infection. Aggressive antibiotic treatment produced no response, and Legionella remained isolatable from lung tissue throughout several weeks of antimicrobial therapy. Human herpesvirus 6 was isolated from a sample of peripheral blood during the acute stage of the patient's illness, and numerous HHV-6--infected macrophages and lymphocytes were detected by immunohistochemical staining of biopsy-derived lung tissue. Paradoxically treatment of the patient with high-dose corticosteroids resulted in dramatic improvement of his condition, including clearance of the Legionella infection. The demonstration that corticosteroids efficiently inhibit HHV-6 replication in vitro suggests that the virus may have contributed to the patient's pneumonitis by enhancing tissue inflammation, by compromising the function of pulmonary macrophages, and, perhaps, by destroying the patient's CD4+ T lymphocytes. Human herpesvirus 6 may be able to function as a synergistic cofactor in lung infections by Legionella and other pathogens. 
Determination of cerebrospinal fluid shunt obstruction with magnetic resonance phase imaging. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow rates in 12 patients with symptoms suggestive of CSF shunt obstruction were measured with magnetic resonance (MR) phase imaging. The shunts were imaged over the skull, just distal to any reservoir, using a curved surface coil. Images perpendicular to the direction of flow were made on a 1.5-tesla clinical unit with a flow-sensitive pulse sequence. The patients' ages ranged from 2 months to 28 years. All patients had ancillary investigations to determine the functional status of the shunt. No flow was detected in seven patients with blocked shunts. Flow rates between 3 and 40 cc/hr were found in three patients with functioning shunts. Two patients, one with a blocked shunt and one with a functioning shunt, could not be imaged due to motion artifact. Magnetic resonance phase imaging is a promising technique in the determination of CSF shunt obstruction. 
An analysis of the aetiology of early childhood deafness. It is generally believed that one in every thousand children is profoundly deaf. An understanding of the aetiology of early childhood deafness and timely detection is crucial in rehabilitation of these children. This study analyses the aetiology of early childhood deafness and shows that deafness is more often acquired than inherited. Non-syndromic deafness, especially occurring on its own, usually produces profoundly deaf children and thus there is the need for genetic studies--in the child, laterally, and longitudinally into generations. Meningitis appears to be the commonest cause of acquired deafness, especially if due to pneumococcus. Only 40 of the 80 cases presented before the age of 2 years. It was therefore interesting to note what factors invoked awareness of deafness to facilitate early presentation. 
The effect of cryopreservation on the development of S- and G2-phase mouse embryos. The survival rate and development of four-cell-stage mouse embryos frozen and thawed in S phase versus G2 phase was compared. Significantly more G2-phase than S-phase embryos survived freezing and thawing. In both groups, disruption of the zona pellucida, fusion of blastomeres, and dispersion of chromosomes were occasionally observed after thawing. Cryopreservation resulted in a longer delay in cleavage from the four- to the eight-cell stage of S (about 5 hr)- and G2-phase embryos (about 3 hr) compared to unfrozen controls. The number of frozen embryos which developed to the blastocyst stage was reduced compared to controls, and in the case of S-phase embryos, formation of the blastocyst cavity was also delayed. However, the average number of cells in the experimental and control embryos was similar. No increased incidence of chromosome abnormalities was seen. Our results suggest that freezing embryos in G2 is superior to freezing in S phase. 
The cosmetic effects of submucous resection. A prospective assessment of the complications of submucous resection is presented. Preoperative photographs were taken and a post-operative assessment was carried out at a minimum time of 2 years by questionnaire and photographs. No examples of significant cosmetic changes were found. 
Benign intrinsic tectal "tumors" in children. A specific group of intrinsic dorsal midbrain tumors was identified in six children by computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Each patient presented with raised intracranial pressure as a result of hydrocephalus due to obstruction of the sylvian aqueduct. No patient had brain-stem signs referable to the tectal tumor initially or subsequently. All six children underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversionary procedures. The radiological features were consistent and specific, with all patients showing tectal calcification or primary increased attenuation of the tectal plate on CT scans. In addition, lack of contrast enhancement was noted initially in four patients and eventually in all six patients. In all patients MR imaging showed a focal tectal tumor distorting the collicular plate with no cystic component and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. There has been no evidence of progression in these six patients in the follow-up period ranging from 8 months to 17 years (8 months and 2 1/2, 4 1/2, 8, and 17 years). Diversion of CSF has been the only surgical treatment and no patient underwent deep x-ray therapy. Five patients have had normal intellectual development. In contrast to the majority of previously described periaqueductal and tectal tumors, this group of lesions appeared to be truly benign. The authors suggest that patients presenting with these clinical and radiological features may be managed by CSF diversion, serial examination, and MR imaging. 
Laser midline glossectomy as a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Multiple site specific procedures have been proposed to treat obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Midline glossectomy (MLG) is a procedure that directly enlarges the hypopharyngeal airspace using the carbon dioxide laser. The initial experience of 12 patients is presented. Midline glossectomy as the sole procedure was performed on 11 patients who had failed uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) and who were felt to have significant hypopharyngeal collapse on physical examination and Muller's maneuver. One patient with primary hypopharyngeal narrowing underwent MLG. Five (42%) were considered responders with Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) decreasing from 60.6 per hour to 14.5 per hour. In seven nonresponders, there was no significant change in the RDI (62.6 events per hour to 48.4 events per hour). Cephalometric analysis showed that responders tended to be more retrognathic (sella-nasion-supramentale (S-N-B = 74.4 degrees)) than nonresponders (S-N-B = 79.3 degrees). Responders were significantly less obese (body mass index (BMI = 30.6)) than nonresponders (BMI = 37.9). There were five minor complications including minor bleeding (n = 3), prolonged odynophagia (n = 1), and minor change in taste (n = 1). There were no major complications, and no persistent difficulties with speech or swallowing. These results demonstrate that direct surgical modification of the tongue base and associated structures can significantly impact obstructive apnea. Midline glossectomy or similar procedures may be useful in a subset of patients with OSAS. 
Clonality and clonal evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple nodules. To determine the clonal evolution of hepatocellular carcinoma, the integrated hepatitis B virus DNA patterns of the main tumor, satellites and/or metastatic lesions were analyzed by Southern-blot hybridization in 28 hepatocellular carcinomas, including three HBsAg-seronegative cases. Unicentric or multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma was confirmed by histopathological criteria in 89% of the cases. Among 17 unicentric hepatocellular carcinomas, minor changes of the integration pattern--including partial loss or addition of the integration sites or both--were detected in the metastatic lesions in 29% of the cases. Furthermore, none of five cases with free-form hepatitis B virus DNA in the primary tumor had detectable free hepatitis B virus DNA in the metastatic lesions. These results suggest that the alteration of integrated hepatitis B virus DNA pattern during the course of tumor growth and metastasis may occur more often than previously perceived and that the switch-off of virus replication may be related to tumor metastatic potential. In eight cases with unilateral, multicentric hepatocellular carcinoma, two clones were detected in six cases, three were seen in another and four were seen in one. One case of note was a 9-yr-old boy with two histological types and two different integration patterns, one associated with vascular invasion and lung metastasis. Three patients with bilateral hepatocellular carcinoma were confirmed to have bicentric or tricentric hepatocellular carcinoma rather than intrahepatic dissemination and had survival rates similar to those in unicentric hepatocellular carcinoma. Three invasive HBsAg-seronegative hepatocellular carcinomas were found to have hepatitis B virus DNA integration and were of unicentric origin. 
Electroencephalographic correlations of extracranial and epidural electrodes in temporal lobe epilepsy. Thirty patients with medically intractable complex partial seizures of temporal lobe origin, but no structural abnormalities on neuroradiologic investigations, had both extracranial (scalp) and epidural EEG recordings. Fifteen patients (50%) had localized, unilateral, ictal, scalp EEGs, but one of these had bilateral independent temporal seizure onset according to epidural recordings. Of the 15 patients in whom scalp EEGs were non-localizing, 12 had well-localized epidural ictal EEGs, and 3 had multifocal or bilateral independent temporal ictal recordings. Epidural recordings provide information for determination of site of onset of temporal lobe seizures in selected patients. 
Acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors induced by interleukin-1 alpha: effects independent of tumor necrosis factor. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a protein synthesized in response to the endotoxin bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is the classical mediator of acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. We have demonstrated that interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), with a spectrum of activities very similar to those of TNF, also causes acute hemorrhagic necrosis of tumors. Both TNF and IL-1 induce a cascade of events including the synthesis or release of each other. The present studies were thus undertaken to determine whether the hemorrhagic necrosis induced in tumors by IL-1 alpha is due to TNF. Kinetic parameters of IL-1 alpha-induced hemorrhage were similar to those observed with recombinant murine TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha) or LPS in RIF-1 fibrosarcomas in C3H/HeN (endotoxin-sensitive) mice. However, the amount of TNF found in the sera or tumors of animals treated with LPS was more than 20-fold higher than in mice treated with IL-1 alpha, and LPS induced similar degrees of hemorrhagic necrosis, which was measured by determining the packed volume of red blood cells by 59Fe labeling. A low but significantly hemorrhagic dose of IL-1 alpha induced no detectable TNF in tumors. Pretreatment with 250 micrograms of neutralizing antibody to TNF had no effect on IL-1 alpha-induced hemorrhage, whereas TNF-alpha- and LPS-induced hemorrhagic effects were significantly reduced. These results demonstrate an important antitumor activity of IL-1 alpha that appears to be independent of TNF. 
Detection of pancreatic fluid and urine leakage after pancreas transplantation: value of CT and cystography. Leakage from the urinary bladder or duodenal stump after pancreas transplantation with urinary bladder drainage of the graft is difficult to diagnose clinically. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with fluoroscopic cystography and CT to determine their relative merit in the diagnosis of pancreatic fluid and urine leakage as documented by surgical exploration in pancreas transplant recipients. Thirteen leaks were diagnosed by fluoroscopic cystography or by CT in 11 patients after pancreas transplantation with urinary bladder drainage of pancreatic fluid. Conventional retrograde fluoroscopic cystography showed 11 leaks; CT with retrograde bladder opacification showed three leaks. Of the five CT studies that did not show a leak and that also were done within 7 days of a cystogram with abnormal findings, failure to use retrograde bladder opacification accounted for the majority (three cases) of missed diagnoses. Focal or free peritoneal abdominal fluid was seen in all CT examinations, with extravasation of contrast material seen into both walled-off collections and free ascites. Our experience suggests that retrograde bladder and duodenal stump opacification should be a routine part of the CT evaluation performed to detect leakage from the urinary bladder or duodenal stump after pancreas transplantation. 
Breast cancer in men: aspects of familial aggregation. Familial aggregation of breast cancer in males was investigated in a population-based case-control study. Cases were ascertained from 10 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program registries in the United States between 1983 and 1986. Controls were identified by random-digit dialing and from lists of Medicare recipients. The relative odds of developing breast cancer were similar in men with affected paternal and maternal relatives and in men with affected mothers and sisters. The risk increased with the number of affected relatives. The relative odds of developing breast cancer were greater in men with first-degree relatives who developed their mammary neoplasm before the age of 45 than in men with older first-degree affected relatives; the enhancement of risk in men with an affected sister was greater in those under age 60 than in older men. These results are similar to those observed by others in studies of breast cancer in women. 
Mitral valve repair: a valuable procedure with good long term results even when performed infrequently. OBJECTIVE--To assess the results of mitral valve repair in a series with a low frequency of repair despite a policy to conserve the valve whenever possible. DESIGN--Retrospective review of case notes with clinical and echocardiographic examination of survivors. SETTING--Cardiac surgery unit in a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS--62 consecutive patients undergoing mitral valve repair by one surgeon between 1979 and 1989. INTERVENTIONS--Mitral valve repair according to the criteria and techniques of Carpentier. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Frequency of repair, operative mortality, actuarial survival, freedom from reoperation and thromboembolism, clinical state, and echocardiographic state. RESULTS--The 62 patients, median age 58 years (interquartile range 51 to 64 years), represent 14% (70% confidence interval 12% to 15%) of the 454 mitral valve operations performed in the study period. Operative mortality was 8% (70% CI 5% to 13%). Actuarial survival was 62% (70% CI 43% to 81%) at nine years. At nine years actuarial freedom from reoperation was 91% (70% CI 79% to 102%) and freedom from thromboembolism 91% (70% CI 80% to 102%). At a median follow up of 33 months (interquartile range 21 to 74 months), 38 of 46 survivors had improved functional state. Of 21 patients who underwent echocardiography one had severe mitral regurgitation and one mitral stenosis. CONCLUSION--Although compared with other reports of mitral valve repair the prevalence of repair was low in this series the results are comparable and justify a positive approach to repair in all patients undergoing mitral valve surgery even if this can only be achieved in a small proportion of patients. 
A combination trial of human lymphoblastoid interferon and bestrabucil (KM2210) for adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma. Both human lymphoblastoid interferon (HLBI) and bestrabucil, the conjugate of chlorambucil and beta-estradiol, have antitumor activity against adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL). Because an in vitro study showed that these two agents combined had a synergistic antiproliferative effect on MOLT-4 and WI-38VA13 cell lines, the authors evaluated the clinical efficacy of this combination in a pilot study with a poor-risk group of ATLL patients. The patients were treated daily with 6 x 10(6) IU of HLBI subcutaneously and 100 mg of bestrabucil orally. In patients with lymphoma-type ATLL or hypercalcemia, prednisolone also was given daily. Of 12 patients suitable for evaluation, nine had partial responses, one had a minor response, and two had no response. All five patients with skin infiltration and both patients with hypercalcemia responded. A history of prior chemotherapy did not affect the response rate. The time to clinical response was 3 to 16 days (median, 11 days) after initiation of treatment. The response duration was 4 to 108+ weeks (median, 9 weeks), but all patients except one relapsed, even during continuing treatment. No serious side effects were observed. Although the response rate with this combination treatment was high, the response duration was short, and other treatments would have to be added to achieve control of this aggressive disease. 
Fatal tonsillar herniation in pseudotumor cerebri. A 27-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri died after lumbar puncture secondary to tonsillar herniation. Five years earlier she had a respiratory arrest after lumbar puncture. MRI and autopsy ruled out the presence of an Arnold-Chiari malformation or a mass lesion of the posterior fossa, but midsagittal views suggested the presence of low-lying cerebellar tonsils. 
Liesegang rings developing within intraperitoneal endometriotic implants. A case report. Liesegang rings are acellular, laminated structures that have been reported to accompany a variety of necrotizing and hemorrhagic tissue processes. Although most frequently seen in the kidneys and synovium, they can be present in other tissues. Liesegang rings are of importance because they are frequently confused by pathologists with helminth ova and nematodes, which they resemble. A case of Liesegang rings was associated with intraperitoneal endometriotic implants, with which the rings appeared to have originated. 
Composition of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries in women less than 40 years of age with fatal coronary artery disease and implications for plaque reversibility. This study analyzes the composition of atherosclerotic plaques in the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries in 8 women less than 40 years of age (mean 34) with fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) and compares these data to previous studies of 37 adults greater than 45 years of age (mean 59) with fatal CAD. Histologic sections were taken at 5-mm intervals from the entire lengths of the right, left main, left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. With the use of a computerized morphometry system, analysis of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries showed the major component of plaque to be a combination of cellular (mean percent total plaque area = 65%, standard error = 6%) and dense (19%, standard error = 6%) fibrous tissue. Arterial segments narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area from these young women were compared with similarly narrowed arteries from 37 older patients (32 men [86%]) with fatal CAD previously reported by this laboratory, and showed significantly more cellular fibrous tissue and lipid-rich foam cells, and lesser amounts of dense fibrous and heavily calcified tissue. The large amount of lipid-containing foam cells and relative lack of acellular scar tissue in coronary plaques in these young women suggests a greater potential for reversibility of these plaques in this subset of patients with CAD. 
Surgical treatment for a case of postoperative Pseudallescheria boydii endophthalmitis. Pseudallescheria boydii (P. boydii) is an uncommon ocular pathogen which previously has been identified in only 10 of 905 fungal isolates identified by the Sid Richardson Microbiology Laboratory at the Cullen Eye Institute of Baylor College of Medicine. Furthermore, only one case of postoperative P. boydii endophthalmitis and four cases of endogenous P. boydii endophthalmitis have been reported. Three of the four patients with endogenous endophthalmitis died within 4 weeks of diagnosis. We describe a second case of postoperative endophthalmitis due to this fungus. The infection was successfully eradicated following vitrectomy, corneoscleral resection, and patch graft, in addition to intraocular, topical, and oral antifungal medication. Although in vitro sensitivities are variable, P. boydii is known to be relatively resistant to amphotericin B. This points to the importance of proper cultures and sensitivities when treating cases of suspected fungal endophthalmitis. Unfortunately, the patient's eye became phthisical 6 months following the initial intervention. 
Antibiotic treatment of tuboovarian abscess: comparison of broad-spectrum beta-lactam agents versus clindamycin-containing regimens. One hundred nineteen patients with tuboovarian abscess were evaluated for response to antibiotics. Results were stratified into three groups by antimicrobial regimen. Group 1 consisted of 37 patients treated with a single-agent broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic and oral doxycycline. Initial clinical response (defined as decreased pain, diminished white blood cell count, or defervescence) in group 1 was 31/37 (84%). Group 2 consisted of 64 patients treated with clindamycin in combination with an aminoglycoside with or without a penicillin. There was an initial clinical response in 45 of 64 (70%). Group 3 consisted of 18 patients from group 1 who were changed to a clindamycin-containing regimen after 2 to 3 days of initial treatment with a single-agent broad-spectrum antibiotic. The decision to switch antibiotics was not based on treatment failure but occurred when delayed ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis of tuboovarian abscess. The switch reflected physician preference for clindamycin-containing regimens in the treatment of tuboovarian abscesses. The response rate in this subset of patients was 14 of 18 (78%). Overall initial clinical response rate was 90 of 119 (75%). There were no statistically significant demographic or clinical differences among the three groups. There was no statistical difference in the rate of early and late antibiotic failure rates among the groups. Our study demonstrates that extended-spectrum antibiotic coverage, including single-agent broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cefoxitin, in conjunction with doxycycline has efficacy that is equivalent to that of clindamycin-containing regimens. An overall medical treatment success rate of 75% suggests that conservative treatment of tuboovarian abscesses is warranted. 
Hemodynamic response with passive neck flexion in brain death. Twelve brain-dead patients admitted to the Department of Traumatology, Osaka University Hospital, from July 1988 to August 1989 were studied. A hemodynamic response elicited by passive neck flexion was observed in 10 of the 12 patients. After passive neck flexion, blood pressure began to rise, and the heart rate increased slightly. Blood pressure peaked about 2 minutes after the initiation of neck flexion and then decreased gradually to the baseline level within a few minutes. These responses were suppressed completely by administration of the ganglion blocker trimethaphan camsilate, which suggests that the efferent pathway of the response is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. 
Extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation in Fuch's heterochromic cyclitis. Twenty-two patients with Fuch's heterochromic cyclitis had a posterior chamber intraocular lens implanted after extracapsular cataract extraction. After a mean follow-up period of 2.5 years (range, 6 to 70 months) half the patients had a visual acuity of 1.0 or more. The results compare favourably with those in the general population. 
The effect of hyperventilation in cluster headache patients. The effect of voluntary hyperventilation was assessed in 22 cluster headache patients (8 in a cluster period and 14 in a remission) and 19 healthy individuals. Using an ear oximeter and a capnograph with a nasal probe, the oxygen saturation (SaO2) and the end-tidal CO2 were monitored continuously. During the hyperventilation per se, cluster headache patients and controls showed absolute values of end-tidal CO2 and of SaO2 of the same order of magnitude. In the posthyperventilation phase, however, the average of the lowest SaO2 levels was lower in controls than in cluster headache patients. In the posthyperventilation phase, headache patients outside the cluster period showed a trend more similar to that of the controls with respect to SaO2 than did those inside the cluster period. The observed discrepancy might, if reproducible, be a consequence of an altered chemoreceptor sensitivity in cluster headache patients during the bout. 
Changes in portal blood flow consequent to partial hepatectomy: Doppler estimation. Hemodynamic changes in portal blood flow were investigated in 56 patients with hepatic tumors who underwent partial hepatectomy. Portal flow was measured with a Doppler ultrasound system before, during, and after surgery. The portal flow of patients who underwent massive hepatectomy decreased intraoperatively. The portal flow per unit of cardiac output decreased in patients who underwent massive or major hepatectomy, patients with a cirrhotic liver, and patients who had a satisfactory postoperative course. Postoperatively, the portal flow in patients with a poor clinical outcome (multiple organ failure, hepatic failure, and cardiorespiratory failure) decreased significantly. Monitoring portal hemodynamic values appears to be useful in providing an index of "hepatic functional reserve." Adequate portal flow is essential for postoperative hepatic regeneration; changes in portal hemodynamic values may be directly related to the patient's ability to survive surgery and to regain or maintain normal liver function. 
Bedside diagnostic blood testing. Its accuracy, rapidity, and utility in blood conservation. OBJECTIVE.--Bedside diagnostic testing utilizing microchemistry instruments potentially offers physicians the opportunity to evaluate urgent blood test results rapidly and reliably using only drops (250 microL) of whole blood. The use of microchemistry technology may also represent an essential component of a blood conservation program in acutely ill patients. We tested the hypothesis that a microchemistry instrument would have important advantages in the intensive care unit, including rapid turnaround time, decreased iatrogenic blood loss, and the provision of accurate analyte results. DESIGN.--One-year prospective, random-sample comparative study. SETTING.--A tertiary, acute care, 1000-bed university teaching hospital and a 450-bed university-affiliated community hospital. PATIENTS.--Blood samples from 850 patients were analyzed. RESULTS.--There were strong correlations (for pH, R2 = .97; PCO2, R2 = .97; PO2, R2 = .99; sodium, R2 = .83; potassium, R2 = .94; chloride, R2 = .90; glucose, R2 = .98; and hematocrit, R2 = .92) when paired samples were analyzed simultaneously in the laboratory comparing the microchemistry instrument and currently accepted clinical laboratory instruments. There were significant correlations (for pH, R2 = .91; PCO2, R2 = .94; PO2, R2 = .97; sodium, R2 = .91; potassium, R2 = .86; chloride, R2 = .91; ionized calcium, R2 = .82; glucose, R2 = .96; and hematocrit, R2 = .75) but increased variability occurred in some analyte results when samples were first analyzed in the intensive care unit (using the microchemistry instrument) and then transported to the laboratory in the routine fashion for "stat" determinations. CONCLUSIONS.--The multichannel microchemistry instrument provided accurate analyte determinations when compared with accepted clinical laboratory instruments. Significant savings of time and blood were also realized by the use of a microchemistry instrument in the intensive care unit. Bedside microchemistry may provide clinically important advantages in emergency departments, operating rooms, and neonatal, pediatric, coronary, adult medical and surgical, trauma, and burn intensive care units. 
Carcinoembryonic antigen levels in peritoneal washings can predict peritoneal recurrence after curative resection of gastric cancer. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were determined in the peritoneal washings from 120 patients with gastric cancer and 9 patients with benign diseases. Elevated values (greater than 100 ng/g of protein) were observed in 20 of 25 patients with gastric cancer with visible dissemination and 16 of 25 patients with serosal invasion but no dissemination. The same elevation was found in only 9 of 70 patients with no serosal invasion and none of the patients with benign disease. The 2-year survival rates after curative operation for the patients with and without elevation of CEA levels were 21% (19 patients) and 100% (66 patients), respectively (P less than 0.001). A negative correlation was found between CEA levels and survival times after noncurative operation. These results indicate that the CEA level in peritoneal washings could be a sensitive detector of invisible peritoneal dissemination and a new predictor for the postoperative prognosis of gastric cancer. 
The clinical management of cirrhosis. The discipline of hepatology is being rapidly advanced by several methods of investigation, most notably those of molecular and genetic biology. The polymerase chain reaction holds very great promise in unraveling the implications of hepatic virus infections. At the present time, we have no method of reversing established cirrhosis, and those with life threatening impairment of liver function can only look to liver transplants for salvage. The clinician can therefore best serve by identifying liver disease before cirrhosis and its complications occur. With effective case finding, and the continued development of therapeutic interventions directed toward known or suspected etiologic and pathogenic factors, many productive, high-quality years can be added to the lifespans of many patients. 
Ossified mucin-secreting choroid plexus adenoma: case report. This is the first report of a fully documented case of an ossified mucin-producing benign choroid plexus tumor. This was a chance finding in a man who complained only of posttraumatic low back discomfort. The ossification of the tumor appears to have been therapeutic. Mucin production may be a defense mechanism. 
Iodine 131-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy and biochemical analyses in suspected pheochromocytoma. Detection of abnormal catecholamine levels and localization of tumor mass are important factors in the diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma. Iodine 131-labeled metaiodobenzylguanidine scintigraphy was performed in 64 patients with suspected pheochromocytoma if their urinary catecholamine levels were borderline or elevated, or if the clinical suspicion for pheochromocytoma was high in spite of normal urinary catecholamine determinations. The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scans were evaluated for abnormal localization of tracer. Twenty-four-hour urine collections were analyzed for vanillylmandelic acid, homovanillic acid, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Thirty of the 64 patients had pheochromocytomas. The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan had a sensitivity and a specificity of 88%. The 24-hour urine vanillylmandelic acid and norepinephrine measurements had the best sensitivity (97%), while the vanillylmandelic acid and homovanillic acid measurements had the best specificity (91%). In patients in whom the vanillylmandelic acid measurement and the 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan were normal, no pheochromocytomas were found. In patients in whom the vanillylmandelic acid measurement and 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan were abnormal, a pheochromocytoma was always present. The 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine scan often documents the presence or absence of a pheochromocytoma and provides localization of the tumor in the preoperative evaluation of these patients. 
Propranolol in prevention of recurrent bleeding from severe portal hypertensive gastropathy in cirrhosis. The two main causes of gastrointestinal bleeding in cirrhosis are oesophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). Rebleeding from varices can be prevented by beta-blockers, but it is not clear whether these drugs effectively reduce rebleeding from PHG. 54 cirrhotic patients with acute or chronic bleeding from severe PHG took part in a randomised, controlled trial to investigate the efficacy of propranolol in prevention of rebleeding from PHG. 26 patients were randomised to receive propranolol daily at a dose that reduced the resting heart rate by 25% or to 55 bpm (20-160 mg twice daily), throughout mean follow-up of 21 (SD 11) months. 28 untreated controls were followed-up, with the same examinations, for 18 (13) months. The actuarial percentages of patients free of rebleeding from PHG were significantly higher in the propranolol-treated patients than in the untreated controls at 12 months (65% vs 38%; p less than 0.05) and at 30 months of follow-up (52% vs 7%; p less than 0.05). Propranolol-treated patients had fewer episodes of acute bleeding than controls (0.010 [0.004] vs 0.120 [0.040] per patient per month). Multivariate analysis showed that absence of propranolol treatment was the only predictive variable for rebleeding. Actuarial survival was slightly higher in the propranolol group than in the controls, but the difference was not significant. Thus, long-term propranolol treatment significantly reduces the frequency of rebleeding from severe PHG, and may improve the prognosis of cirrhotic patients with this disorder. 
Efficacy of pulmonary metastasectomy for recurrent soft tissue sarcoma. To evaluate surgical results of resection of second (recurrent) pulmonary metastases from adult soft tissue sarcoma, the survival of 39 patients was analyzed retrospectively. With the exclusion of two patients (one with interval metastases between staged resections and one without histologically proved metastases), three patients were found to have unresectable disease (median survival, 7 months). A significantly (P = 0.0001) longer median survival (28 months) was found for 34 patients whose recurrent metastases were completely resected. The only other factor predicting significantly longer post-thoracotomy survival was resection of a solitary metastatic nodule (median survival, 65 months). Patients who had two or more recurrent nodules resected had a median survival of 14 months only (P = 0.01). Although trends toward longer survival were noted for other prognostic factors, none reached statistical significance. We conclude that the complete resection of a solitary second (recurrent) pulmonary metastatic nodule from adult soft tissue sarcoma predicts long-term survival. 
Effects of interferon on intrahepatic human leukocyte antigens and lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. We investigated the effects of interferon therapy on hepatocyte human leukocyte antigen class I and class II antigen expression and intrahepatic lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B (n = 11) and C (n = 10). Interferon-alpha was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 3 to 18 million international units daily for 4 wk. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained just before and immediately after treatment, and the specimens were stained by the indirect immunoperoxidase method for evaluation of human leukocyte antigen expression and lymphocyte subsets. Before therapy, no significant difference was noted between hepatitis B and C in human leukocyte antigen class I antigen expression on hepatocytes or in the lymphocyte subsets in the intralobular and portal areas. After interferon-alpha treatment, hepatocyte expression of human leukocyte antigen class I antigens and serum beta 2-microglobulin levels were virtually unchanged in chronic viral hepatitis C patients, but both were increased in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. Human leukocyte antigen class II antigens were not expressed during treatment. The mean number of intralobular CD3+ and CD8+ cells and the mean serum ALT level decreased significantly in chronic viral hepatitis C patients (p less than 0.05) but not in chronic viral hepatitis B patients. The mean number of intralobular CD4+ cells was unaffected by interferon therapy in both groups. In all 21 patients, the changes in CD8+ cell numbers paralleled the changes in serum ALT levels. Our findings suggest that T-cell cytotoxicity may play an important role in hepatocyte damage in both chronic viral hepatitis C and chronic viral hepatitis B and that the response to interferon-alpha differs in these two types of hepatitis. 
Thymic targets for Abelson murine leukemia virus are early gamma/delta T lymphocytes. Molecular analysis has shown that the majority of Abelson murine leukemia virus (Ab-MuLV)-induced primary thymomas represent transformed gamma/delta thymocytes. Many of these thymomas are of monoclonal origin as judged by provirus integration pattern and contain rearranged genes encoding T-cell receptor (TCR) gamma and delta chains but germ-line immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes. Some of the monoclonal tumors contain multiple rearranged alleles encoding TCR gamma, delta, and beta chains. Further, one Ab-MuLV thymoma cell line contained germ-line-configuration TCR gamma- and delta-chain genes, which became rearranged after in vitro propagation. Clones of this cell line were observed to rearrange these genes after intrathymic passage. Also, some subclones of this cell line underwent rearrangement of their immunoglobulin heavy-chain genes in culture. These observations suggest that the thymic targets for Ab-MuLV transformation are early gamma/delta thymocytes, some of which continue to rearrange their TCR gamma- and delta-chain genes. 
Changing patterns in presentation and management of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in Northern Ireland, 1970-1988 The clinical features, diagnostic methods, management and survival in 16 cases of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome encountered in Northern Ireland between the years 1970 and 1988 are described. While the majority of patients in the first decade of the study period had surgical treatment, those presenting in the latter period have been managed with medical therapy in the form of H2-receptor antagonists or omeprazole. The increasing use of these agents seems to be altering the severe clinical features of this condition, reducing the indications for surgery and maintaining patients, with or without evidence of metastatic disease, in clinical remission. 
Ovarian cyst aspiration and the outcome of in vitro fertilization. This study was designed to ascertain whether any benefit would be derived from aspirating ovarian cysts identified before ovarian stimulation in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization. Thirty-seven patients who had ovarian cysts were categorized into two groups: group A (n = 14) with baseline ovarian cysts and group B (n = 23) with ovarian cysts that developed during pituitary suppression with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog. Each group was prospectively randomized into two subgroups depending on whether the ovarian cysts were aspirated or not. In group A, there was a significantly greater number of follicles and oocytes in the ovaries in which cysts were aspirated. However, there was no significant difference in the total number of follicles, oocytes retrieved and fertilized, or in the final outcome. In group B, there was no significant difference in folliculogenesis between the aspirated and nonaspirated subgroups. These observations suggest that the presence of a baseline ovarian cyst may reduce folliculogenesis but do not support routine cyst aspiration if the patient has two functional ovaries. 
Immediate effect of vagotomy on pancreatic insulin secretion. The effect of vagotomy and gastric resection on insulin secretion was examined by the glucagon stimulated C-peptide test in gastrectomy patients (n = 11) without truncal vagotomy and in total gastrectomy patients (n = 10) with truncal vagotomy. The test was performed twice in each patient: 10 minutes after the midline incision was made and then 60 to 90 minutes later when gastric resection or total gastrectomy was completed, during the reconstructive phase of the operation. Gastric resection without truncal vagotomy was followed by a higher increase (48%) in serum C-peptide concentration caused by glucagon stimulation than total gastrectomy with truncal vagotomy (13%). There was a significant (p less than 0.05) increase in the glucagon stimulated glucose-related C-peptide concentration in patients without truncal vagotomy, whereas truncal vagotomy inhibited this increase. These results suggest that truncal vagotomy will produce a reduction in stimulated insulin secretion in humans. 
Cerebral hyperemia during spontaneous cluster headaches with excessive cerebral vasoconstriction to hyperoxia. Values for local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) were measured in three dimensions utilizing xenon enhanced computerized tomography among patients during spontaneously occurring cluster headaches, during headache-free intervals and immediately after terminating attacks by inhalation of 100% oxygen. Results were compared with values measured among age-matched normal volunteers. LCBF values measured in five cluster patients while headache-free did not differ from similar measures among age-matched normal volunteers. In three patients during attacks of spontaneously occurring cluster headache, LCBF values for temporal cortex, basal ganglia and subcortical white matter were increased. Immediately after terminating attacks of cluster by 100% oxygen inhalation for five minutes, LCBF values for temporal cortex and basal ganglia became significantly decreased below normal values in five patients with spontaneously occurring cluster headache. Prompt relief of head pain by inhalation of 100% oxygen is associated with abolition of the hyperperfusion of both cortical and subcortical brain structures that occurs during spontaneously occurring cluster headaches and is followed by excessive cerebrovascular constriction. It remains to be determined whether the cerebral hyperemia occurring during cluster headaches is causally related to the head pain or is secondary to the pain itself. Rapid termination of head pain by hyperoxia associated with excessive cerebral vasoconstriction suggests that this vascular phenomenon is unique to cluster headache and offers clues to its pathogenesis. 
Lack of evidence for estrogen receptors in human and bovine parathyroid tissue. It has been hypothesized that estrogen may have a direct effect to reduce the set-point for PTH secretion which may be implicated in its hypocalcemic action. If this is so, estrogen receptors should be demonstrable within parathyroid tissue. Seven human parathyroid adenomas and five samples of normal bovine parathyroid tissue were examined using classical hormone-binding techniques. In no case was there evidence of displaceable estrogen binding of high affinity and low capacity. To exclude the presence of receptors within a small subset of the cells, five of the human adenomas were further studied by immunohistochemistry using a monoclonal antibody to the human estrogen receptor. In no case was there evidence of estrogen receptors. We conclude that the hypocalcemic action of estrogen replacement is unlikely to be mediated via a classical estrogen receptor within the parathyroid, although normal parathyroid tissue was not studied. 
Comparison of sucralfate and ranitidine in the treatment of duodenal ulcers. Ninety patients with endoscopically proven duodenal ulcers, enrolled in this prospective, single-blind study, were randomized to sucralfate, 1 g q.i.d., 0.5 hour before meals on an empty stomach or at bedtime, or ranitidine, 150 mg b.i.d., for 4-8 weeks (phase I). Patients who healed during the treatment period were invited to participate in a maintenance therapy follow-up covering 1 year (phase II), during which they were treated with sucralfate, 1 g b.i.d. (before breakfast and at bedtime) or 150 mg of ranitidine at bedtime. After 4 weeks of treatment, healing rates were 30/40 (75.0%) with sucralfate and 36/42 (85.7%) with ranitidine, and healing rates were 39/40 (97.6%) and 40/42 (95.2%) respectively, after 8 weeks of treatment. At the end of the 6th and 12th months of phase II, respectively, relapse rates were 3/33 (9.4%) and 10/32 (31.3%) in the sucralfate group and 5/33 (15.2%) and 10/29 (34.5%) in the ranitidine group. Differences between sucralfate- and ranitidine-treated groups were not significant. Both treatments were well tolerated. We conclude that sucralfate is as effective and safe as ranitidine in the short-term treatment and prevention of relapse in patients with ulcer disease. 
Aspirin in the prevention of thrombosis. More than a decade has passed since the introduction of the concept that inhibition of platelet function may be helpful in preventing the initiation of thrombus formation. Aspirin has been recognized as inhibiting normal platelet function and the mechanism has been clearly delineated. Legions of patients have been studied to answer the question of whether aspirin is efficacious in the primary prevention of acute myocardial infarction. At the present time, however, a solid, clear answer is not available and firm recommendations cannot be made. A large number of studies evaluating aspirin and other antiplatelet agents in the prevention or delay of recurrent myocardial infarction (secondary prevention) have been completed and those studies reporting a favorable beneficial effect are in the minority. In these secondary prevention studies reporting success, the doses of aspirin employed were large enough to inhibit both the cyclo-oxygenase system and thromboxane A2 production as well as the synthesis of prostacyclin. Thus, in these studies if aspirin is effective in reducing adverse cardiovascular events, its efficacy is being mediated by an unknown mechanism. If the reader of the few studies that report positive results is convinced of the benefit of aspirin, it must be emphasized that thoughtful, cautious patient selection based upon the individual's cardiovascular risk profile must be exercised. Individual variation may exist with respect to aspirin's beneficial effect. It must be absolutely recognized that aspirin or any antiplatelet agent does not in any way substitute for the removal or treatment of coexisting risk factors such as tobacco, obesity, hypercholesterolemia, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and metabolic disease. In contrast to aspirin, control of the above risk factors has been established as beneficial. Aspirin is not free of undesirable side-effects; fatalities secondary to hemorrhage have been reported, and these must be known in detail and understood by both physician and patient before this agent is prescribed in the prophylactic treatment of cardiovascular disease. 
A case report of massive vulvar edema during tocolysis of preterm labor. Bilateral vulvar edema that is not associated with preeclampsia has been reported only rarely during pregnancy or the puerperium. A primiparous patient in premature labor at 34 weeks' gestation with no history of lymphatic or venous obstruction underwent combination tocolysis with intravenous ritodrine and magnesium sulfate. On the fifth day of tocolysis, edema developed in the right labium majus pudendi and gradually spread to the left labia during the ensuing 24 hours. The patient remained afebrile, normotensive, and without signs of localized infection or anasarca. A trial of triple intravenous antibiotics and local skin care proved ineffective. By the ninth hospital day, the edema and discomfort had progressed, thereby precluding vaginal examination without sedation. In spite of progressive cervical dilatation with tocolysis, cesarean delivery was performed. With no further treatment, the vulvar edema gradually resolved during the next week. 
Steroid therapy for hydrops associated with antibody-mediated congenital heart block. Evaluation of fetal bradycardia noted during a routine prenatal visit at 24 weeks' gestation in a mother without symptoms showed an antibody-mediated heart block with anti-La (SSB) antibody present. The fetus had a pericardial effusion and ascites. After maternal steroid therapy, the ascites resolved and the pericardial effusion was substantially diminished. Steroid therapy may be a helpful adjunct for treatment of a premature infant with hydrops as a result of antibody-mediated heart block. 
Oral enoximone therapy in chronic heart failure: a placebo-controlled randomized trial. The Western Enoximone Study Group. In a parallel study design, 164 patients with New York Heart Association Functional class II or III heart failure were randomized to receive either enoximone given as 50 mg three times a day, or 100 mg three times a day, or a matching placebo. All patients were receiving digitalis and/or diuretics and had left ventricular ejection fractions less than or equal to 45. Exercise tests were performed after 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment. Enoximone produced significantly greater increases in exercise time than placebo treatment at weeks 4 and 8 (p = 0.012, p = 0.029, respectively) but not after 12 weeks. Left ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly after the first dose of enoximone but not after 12 weeks of long-term therapy. Heart failure symptoms and the physicians' evaluations of cardiac status were significantly improved in both enoximone therapy groups during the first 4 weeks of evaluation when compared with evaluations of cardiac status in the placebo group. Diuretic doses were increased more frequently for patients who were receiving a placebo. Adverse events were reported with similar frequency in the placebo and 50 mg enoximone treatment groups; 100 mg enoximone resulted in a significantly greater incidence of adverse events. Mean heart rate and ventricular ectopic activity were not significantly different among the three treatment limbs. Enoximone appears to improve exercise tolerance, ventricular function, and symptoms of heart failure for 4 to 8 weeks. Heart rate, ventricular ectopic activity, and mortality rate were not increased. 
A 21-year experience with major hemorrhage after percutaneous liver biopsy Nine thousand two hundred twelve liver biopsies were performed according to a defined protocol, and data were prospectively recorded to identify risk factors for major bleeding. There were 10 fatal and 22 nonfatal hemorrhages (0.11% and 0.24%, respectively). By comparison with a control group that did not hemorrhage, malignancy, age, sex, and the number of passes were the only predictable risk factors. The risk of fatal hemorrhage in patients with malignancy is estimated to be 0.4%; for nonfatal hemorrhage, 0.57%. In patients undergoing liver biopsy for nonmalignant disease, the risks are 0.04% and 0.16%, respectively. 
Escherichia coli bacteremia in children. A review of 91 cases in 10 years. We reviewed 91 cases of pediatric Escherichia coli bacteremia during a 10-year period. Thirty one patients were afebrile; a significantly greater proportion of these patients were aged less than 1 month, had ampicillin-resistant E coli isolates, or had persistent bacteremia 24 hours after initiating antibiotic therapy. Infection was community acquired in 65 cases; associated urinary tract infection was six times more common in this setting than in nosocomially acquired infections. In 85 cases at least 1 underlying medical condition/focus of infection was identified at the time the positive blood culture was obtained, the most common were immune deficiency states (38 cases), urinary tract infection (29 cases), and lesions of the gastrointestinal tract (27 cases). Polymicrobial bacteremia occurred in five cases. Twelve patients died; significantly associated with death were hypotension requiring pressor therapy, presence of a central venous catheter, and neutropenia. 
Characterization of the mononuclear cell infiltrate and HLA-Dr expression in 19 oligodendrogliomas. We have studied frozen tissue from 19 oligodendrogliomas with a panel of antibodies to lymphocytes and their subsets, macrophages, natural killer cells, and HLA-Dr antigens. Macrophages were detected in moderate numbers in 60%-100% of tumors depending on the antibody used. T lymphocytes were fewer in number than macrophages and were present in 62% of cases. Most of the T lymphocytes were of the CD8 phenotype. CD4 lymphocytes were very few in number and present in only 18%. B cells and natural killer cells were absent from all cases. HLA-Dr antigens were expressed by macrophages in all cases but never on tumor cells. The implications of these findings are that macrophages and, to a lesser extent, CD8 lymphocytes are the predominant cells infiltrating oligodendrogliomas and that they may exert cellular immune functions. 
Rectal thiopental compared with intramuscular meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine for pediatric sedation. STUDY OBJECTIVES: We studied the hypothesis that rectal thiopental is an effective agent for emergency department pediatric sedation and may have advantages over a more traditional regimen. DESIGN: Rectal thiopental 25 mg/kg was compared with the combination of meperidine 2 mg/kg, promethazine 1 mg/kg, and chlorpromazine 1 mg/kg in a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Children between 18 months and 6 years of age presenting to our teaching hospital ED for laceration repair were entered after the clinical decision was made to sedate. Patients with altered sensorium, medical contraindications to sedation, or medication allergy were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: After informed consent, each patient received IM injection (drug combination or placebo) and rectal suspension (rectal thiopental or placebo) simultaneously. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Vital signs, pulse oximetry, and pediatric Glasgow Coma Scores were recorded before and every 15 minutes after sedation until discharge. Intradermal lidocaine and suturing began when the patient appeared adequately sedated, and response was numerically scored. Patients were discharged when able to stand. Twenty-nine patients 34 +/- 13 months old were studied. Fifteen patients received rectal thiopental, and 14 received the drug combination. Analysis using the Wilcoxon two-sample test revealed no differences in age, sex, weight, or wound location between groups. The time course of sedation was different for the two treatment regimens. At 15 and 30 minutes after administration, patients who received rectal thiopental were more deeply sedated than those who received the drug combination, as evidenced by significantly lower Glasgow Coma Scores (P less than .05). Accordingly, time from medication administration to suturing was 29 +/- 12 minutes in the thiopental group and 54 +/- 33 minutes (P less than .01) in the drug combination group. Patients in the thiopental group also recovered more quickly and were discharged approximately one-half hour earlier than those in the drug combination group (89 +/- 25 vs 120 +/- 44 minutes, P less than .05). No difference in response to lidocaine injection or suturing was demonstrated between the groups. Laceration repair time was comparable between the groups. There were eight sedation failures (three of 15 in thiopental group and five of 14 in drug combination group, P = NS). Vital signs remained stable, no adverse reactions occurred, and no patient had decreased oxygen saturation to less than 95%. CONCLUSION: Rectal thiopental is superior to this drug combination for pediatric sedation because it can be administered painlessly, has a more rapid onset and offset of action, and is of equal safety and efficacy at the dosage studied. 
The orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: evaluation of autonomic function and treatment with octreotide and ergot alkaloids. Orthostatic tachycardia is a poorly understood syndrome in which patients develop dizziness, diaphoresis, or palpitations upon shifting from the supine to the upright posture. The present study was performed to determine whether autonomic neuropathy might be present in these patients, and whether the abnormal hemodynamic response to standing might be the result of failure of reflex vasoconstriction. We measured autonomic function in 9 patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia and 2 patients with orthostatic tachycardia and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and compared them to 33 age-matched controls. Although most patients with orthostatic tachycardia had normal vasomotor reflexes and normal surface potential amplitudes, the latency of the autonomic response, a measure of sympathetic nerve conduction velocity, was prolonged in the soles (2.44 +/- 0.08 s in patients with idiopathic orthostatic tachycardia vs. 2.12 +/- 0.04 s in controls; P less than 0.005). In 6 of 9 patients, however, the latencies were within the normal range. Autonomic surface potentials were absent in 1 diabetic patient with orthostatic tachycardia; the latency of the response in the feet was greatly prolonged (2.95 s) in the second patient. We also assessed the response of orthostatic tachycardia patients to octreotide and dihydroergotamine, which are known to have a pressor effect in patients with recognized forms of autonomic neuropathy. These agents, in combination, suppressed orthostatic tachycardia (from 116 +/- 7 to 89 +/- 6 beats/min; P less than 0.001) in patients with this syndrome. In summary, our data indicate that evidence of autonomic dysfunction is present in only a minority of patients with orthostatic tachycardia. Nevertheless, administration of the vasoconstrictor drugs dihydroergotamine and octreotide can prevent the abnormal hemodynamic response to the upright posture shown by patients with this syndrome. 
Indium-111-leukocyte imaging in acute cholecystitis. Eleven patients with suspected acute cholecystitis underwent sequential 99mTc-iminodiacetic derivative (IDA) and 111In-white blood cell (WBC) imaging to determine if 111In-WBCs accumulate within an acutely inflamed hemorrhagic gallbladder wall and, thus, could be employed as a reasonable alternative to 99mTc-IDA scintigraphy in detecting acute cholecystitis. Seven patients had surgically confirmed acute cholecystitis. Of these cases, five had a true-positive 99mTc-IDA and 111In-WBC, one an indeterminate 111In-WBC and true-positive 99mTc-IDA, and one a true-positive 111In-WBC and false-negative 99mTc-IDA scan. The remaining four patients did not have acute cholecystitis. All visualized their gallbladder within 1 hr after 99mTc-IDA administration and none had 111In-WBC gallbladder wall uptake. Both 111In-WBC and 99mTc-IDA scintigraphy accurately detected acute cholecystitis: hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated a cystic duct obstruction and 111In-WBC imaging detected the inflammatory infiltrate within the gallbladder wall. The sensitivity and specificity of each was 86% and 100%, respectively. 
Variations in anatomy of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel: pitfalls in the diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Two processes account for most instances of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow: compression in the retroepicondylar groove, and compression by the humeroulnar aponeurotic arcade joining the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris. While conventional electrodiagnostic criteria may localize an ulnar neuropathy to the elbow, separating retroepicondylar compression from humeroulnar arcade compression is more difficult. In 130 cadaver elbows, we examined the relationships between the medial epicondyle, flexor carpi ulnaris, and ulnar nerve. The humeroulnar arcade lay from 3 to 20 mm distal to the medial epicondyle, the intramuscular course of the nerve through the flexor carpi ulnaris ranged from 18 to 70 mm, and the nerve exited the flexor carpi ulnaris 28 to 69 mm distal to the medial epicondyle. In 6 specimens, dense fibrous bands bridged directly between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon proximal to the cubital tunnel proper; accessory epitrochleoanconeus muscles were present in 14 specimens: both may cause ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. Anatomical variations may contribute to the difficulty in separating causes of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow. 
Chronic persistent cough and gastro-oesophageal reflux. Chronic cough persisting for two months or more that remains unexplained after extensive investigations is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this study was to determine whether such cough is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. Thirteen patients with chronic persistent cough that was unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment were identified. All were non-smokers. The mean (SE) duration of cough was 17.8 (8.0) months. Ten had never had reflux symptoms and three had had mild symptoms only after the onset of the cough. All the patients completed standardised cough diary cards for eight weeks and underwent 24 hour ambulatory oesophageal pH monitoring. A reflux episode was defined as a fall in oesophageal pH to below 4.0. Nine control subjects were matched for age, lung function, and body mass index. The patients experienced significantly more episodes of reflux per 24 hours than the controls (115.8 (SE 31.7) versus 4.7 (1.4) and longer reflux episodes (15.5 (5.8) versus 1.7 (0.5) minutes), and the oesophageal pH was below 4.0 considerably longer (84.5 (20.2) versus 3.8 (1.3) minutes). Cough occurred simultaneously with 13% (2.2%) of reflux episodes and within five minutes in another 35% (5.8%) of episodes, whereas gastro-oesophageal reflux occurred simultaneously with 78% (5.5%) of cough episodes and within five minutes in another 12% (2.3%) of episodes. It is concluded that chronic persistent cough that remains unexplained after a standard diagnostic assessment is associated with otherwise asymptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux. It is suggested that a self perpetuating mechanism may exist whereby acid reflux causes cough via a local neuronal oesophageal-tracheo-bronchial reflex, and the cough in turn amplifies reflux via increased transdiaphragmatic pressure or by inducing transient lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation. Further study of this mechanism and the role of specific antireflux treatment in chronic persistent cough is warranted. 
Peroneal nerve repair. Surgical results. Eleven patients had either repair (two) or nerve graft reconstruction (nine) of the common peroneal nerve or its superficial or deep divisions about the knee. The average follow-up period was 29.1 months. A good or excellent result was achieved in six (54.5%) patients. The results appeared best when direct nerve repair was possible or when a defect of 6 cm or less required grafting. Peroneal nerve exploration and repair or reconstruction as required seem indicated for known nerve disruption or unknown nerve continuity if there is no suggestion of continuing recovery by three to six months after the injury. 
Large-cell lymphoma presenting with hepatic sinusoidal infiltration. We describe a case of large-cell lymphoma of B-cell phenotype with clinicopathologic features resembling malignant histiocytosis. The clinical presentation was characterized by fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated liver enzyme levels. These features and the finding of a predominantly sinusoidal infiltrate of neoplastic cells on liver biopsy raised the suspicion of malignant histiocytosis. The patient subsequently developed supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, which proved to be due to a diffuse large-cell lymphoma. Immunophenotypic studies performed on the lymph node and the original liver biopsy specimen established the B-cell nature of neoplastic cells at both sites. This case highlights a rare pattern of hepatic involvement by large-cell lymphoma, and contrasts the latter with other hematologic disorders associated with hepatic sinusoidal infiltrates. 
Anetodermic prurigo nodularis (with Pautrier's neuroma) responsive to arotinoid acid. A woman had symmetrically distributed pruritic nodules for more than 40 years. Microscopically they were characterized by proliferation of nonmyelinated nerve fibers (Pautrier's neuroma) and a total absence of epidermal involvement. Anetoderma developed at the site of former nodules. Her condition responded favorably to repeated retinoid therapy with regression of nodules in those sites in which retinoid dermatitis had developed. 
Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney: CT, sonographic, and pathologic correlation. The sonographic and computed tomographic findings in 12 children aged 1-6 years with clear cell sarcoma of the kidney were reviewed retrospectively. Tumor size, calcification, and internal architecture were characterized and correlated with the gross pathologic findings. All tumors were unilateral and large (8.5-16 cm in diameter). Except for one, all masses were predominantly solid, and all contained some well-defined portions of low attenuation or hypoechogenicity that represented tumor necrosis. In addition, seven tumors contained uncomplicated fluid-filled cysts with diameters ranging from a few millimeters to 5 cm. Extension into the inferior vena cava was not noted. The radiologic features of clear cell sarcoma of the kidney are common to all malignant renal neoplasms. Some cases, however, may have features that simulate those of benign conditions, such as multilocular cystic nephroma or segmental cystic dysplasia. No pattern was discerned that would permit discrimination between clear cell sarcoma of the kidney and the most common renal neoplasm of childhood, Wilms tumor. 
Flow velocity waveforms of the fetal circulation preceding fetal death in a case of lupus anticoagulant. Flow velocity waveforms of the vascular system were evaluated at 25 weeks 2 days and 27 weeks 5 days of gestation in the case of a severely growth-retarded fetus. At the first scan, the cerebral vessels displayed low pulsatility indexes, reflecting the brain-sparing pattern that characterizes fetal stress. This compensatory reduction was lost at the time of the second, "preterminal" scan. 
Adenocarcinoma of rete testis. Role of inguinal orchiectomy plus retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Adenocarcinoma of the rete testis is diagnosed rarely. We describe the clinical and pathologic findings in a forty-seven-year-old man with this unusual tumor. Treatment modalities are reviewed emphasizing the role of radical orchiectomy and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. 
The clinical spectrum of renal osteodystrophy in 57 chronic hemodialysis patients: a correlation between biochemical parameters and bone pathology findings. Fifty-nine chronic hemodialysis patients who had been on dialysis for an average of 77 months underwent bone biopsies and the pathologic findings were correlated with biochemical and demographic data. All but two had evidence of renal osteodystrophy, 23 with osteitis fibrosa (OF), 19 with osteomalacia and/or adynamic disease (OM/AD), and 15 with mixed osteodystrophy (MOD). Patients in each group were similar with regard to age, sex distribution, duration of dialysis, unstimulated serum aluminum, calcium and phosphorus. Patients with osteitis fibrosa (OF) had statistically higher DFO stimulated aluminum, alkaline phosphatase and PTHC levels than the other two groups although there was marked individual variation. The bone biopsies were also evaluated for the amount of aluminum deposited in the osteoid seam. All 23 of the patients with OF and 11 of the 15 patients with MOD had no, mild, or minimal aluminum deposition but 12 of the 19 patients with OM/AD had moderate to marked aluminum deposition. Patients with minimal to mild aluminum deposition were similar in age, duration of dialysis, sex distribution, unstimulated and DFO stimulated aluminum levels, calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase to those with moderate to marked deposition but had significantly higher parathormone levels. All patients had been treated in a similar fashion regarding diet, oral phosphate binders and vitamin D; therefore, the observed differences in bone pathology were not readily explicable. However, patients who were found to have osteitis fibrosa and those with minimal to mild aluminum deposition had significantly higher parathormone levels when compared with patients in the other groups at the inception of dialysis. 
Asthma deaths. Deaths from asthma seem to be increasing in spite of considerable improvements in drug treatment and management plans. There are many hypotheses to explain this, but little emphasis has been placed on the possibility that confidence in better drug treatments may modify patients' behavior so as to place them at greater risk of illness. It is well recognized that excessive confidence in bronchodilator inhalers and nebulizers can make patients stay away from hospitals too long during acute attacks. It is also very possible that prevention of symptoms by use of antiasthma drugs could allow patients to spend more time in environments containing antigens or other agents that provoke asthma, resulting in more serious and long-lasting bronchial inflammation and reactivity. 
Longitudinal study of cerebral spinal fluid drainage in polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase in paraplegia associated with thoracic aortic cross-clamping. It has been hoped that pharmacologic prophylaxis in thoracic aortic cross-clamping may avert the unpredictable complication of spinal cord paraplegia, may avoid the mechanical difficulties associated with shunts, partial bypass, or monitoring devices, and may serve as a substitute for or as an adjunct to cerebral spinal fluid drainage. Toward this end 21 mongrel dogs were studied in four groups and underwent 60 minutes of thoracic aortic cross-clamping: group I, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping; group II, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and cerebral spinal fluid drainage; group III, five with thoracic aortic cross-clamping, cerebrospinal fluid drainage and intravenous administration of a single dose (5000 units/kg) of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) given 15 to 20 minutes before thoracic aortic cross-clamping; and group IV, six with thoracic aortic cross-clamping and PEG-SOD. Paraplegia was graded by the Tarlov method at 24 hours and up to 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. The carotid and femoral artery pressures, the central venous pressure, and core temperature, taken during the experiment and at the time the dogs were killed, were found to be similar between groups. At 24 hours all dogs in group I were paraplegic; groups II and III had no paraplegic dogs (p less than 0.01), and group IV had fewer paraplegic dogs (two of six) than group I (p less than 0.05). Paraplegia was averted in all dogs treated with cerebral spinal fluid drainage, even 5 days after thoracic aortic cross-clamping. 
The importance of surface immunoglobulin, mouse rosettes, and CD5 in the immunophenotyping of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and reactive lymphocytosis. Peripheral blood from 167 B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and 119 reactive lymphocytosis (RLC) patients were analyzed to evaluate the immunophenotypic diagnostic value of mouse rosettes (M-rosette), and weak expression of monoclonal surface immunoglobulin (SIg). In B-CLL, 145 cases were M-rosette+ (86.83%), 135 surface immunoglobulin (SIg)+ (80.84%), and 117 M-rosette+ SIg+ (70.06%). Of 32 SIg- cases, 28 were M-rosette+; and of 22 M-rosette-cases, 18 were SIg+. By combining results of the two assays and accepting positivity of either one or both as sufficient for diagnosis, B-CLL was diagnosed in 163 cases (97.60%). CD5 was performed in 49 cases of the 167 with paired data for SIg and M-rosettes. By combining the results of the three assays and accepting positivity of any two or all three as sufficient for diagnosis, all 49 cases (100%) were diagnosed. Correlation analysis showed no significant association between M-rosette, SIg, and CD5 expression. The results demonstrate the independent expression of the three markers, and their complementary role in immunophenotyping B-CLL. In RLC, all 119 cases were T-lineage and SIg-, and 115 were M-rosette-, indicating the role of the two markers in differentiating B-CLL from RLC. Three of the four M-rosette+ T-RLC were subsequently diagnosed as B-CLL, suggesting the necessity of follow-up of such cases. 
Mucinous pancreatic tumors: ERCP findings Mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas are rare and difficult to diagnose neoplasms. To further characterize the nature of these lesions, four such cases are described here in which the diagnosis was suspected at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography by the presence of ampullary or intraductal mucus. In one patient, pancreatoscopy directly visualized the tumor. Ultrasound and computed tomography failed to suggest the presence of a neoplasm in the majority of these cases, but endoscopic ultrasound was performed in one and correctly identified the multi-cystic tumor. A high incidence of acute pancreatitis was seen in these cases and was felt to be secondary to intermittent ductal obstruction by mucus. The characteristic appearance of intra-ductal mucus provides an important clue to the presence of this type of pancreatic neoplasia. 
Cerebral hemorrhagic risk of aspirin or heparin therapy with thrombolytic treatment in rabbits. We studied the incidence of cerebral hemorrhage in an animal model of embolic stroke to determine the safety of aspirin, heparin, and tissue plasminogen activator therapies. We occluded the middle cerebral arteries of rabbits with labeled blood clots and administered either tissue plasminogen activator, heparin, aspirin, tissue plasminogen activator plus aspirin, tissue plasminogen activator plus heparin, or saline at various times after stroke. Compared to saline controls, both the aspirin-only and the tissue plasminogen activator-plus-aspirin groups had a significantly higher incidence of cerebral hemorrhage, whereas the heparin and tissue plasminogen activator combination groups did not. We conclude that aspirin antiplatelet therapy alone may increase the risk of hemorrhagic infarction, whereas heparin or tissue plasminogen activator therapy appears to be relatively safe. 
Evaluation of the patient with stable angina following coronary artery bypass surgery. Bypass graft stenosis and occlusion are relatively common events, occurring eventually in the majority of patients who survive beyond 5 years after coronary artery bypass graft surgery. These processes, in combination with progressive native coronary artery disease, lead to recurrent angina and an increased need for medication in most patients late after surgery. Patients with unstable ischemic symptoms generally should proceed directly to coronary arteriography, whereas patients with stable angina may be candidates for noninvasive testing to evaluate their risk and the extent of myocardial jeopardy. If the initial revascularization procedure is successful, preoperative thallium 201 imaging abnormalities should be reversed. Persistent abnormalities beyond 6 months after revascularization indicate incomplete revascularization or perioperative infarction. Defects noted in the immediate postoperative period may be areas of myocardial stunning or hibernation, which can require up to 6 months to reverse. If chest pain recurs after revascularization, a normal thallium 201 perfusion pattern indicates that the symptom is probably not ischemic in nature. Thallium 201 perfusion abnormalities may precede symptoms by several months and may be the only indication of significant myocardial ischemia in patients with silent ischemia. Advanced tomographic imaging techniques, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), should theoretically improve disease detection and localization following revascularization. Practically speaking, only the left anterior descending coronary bed is well evaluated by these tomographic imaging techniques. The sensitivity and specificity of SPECT imaging for evaluation of posterior circulation abnormalities remains unacceptably low. Complexities of competitive flow and collateralization that may exist in the postoperative period make it difficult to relate perfusion abnormalities to a specific graft stenosis. However, tomographic perfusion imaging may provide useful correlative information on the functional impact of bypass graft stenoses in patients with recurrent angina who have undergone coronary angiography and in whom the angiographic indications for repeat surgery or angioplasty are not compelling. Newer tomographic and metabolic imaging techniques such as CT, NMRI, and PET remain unproven as diagnostic tests for the evaluation of unselected patient populations presenting with recurrent angina following revascularization surgery. 
Brain tumors occurring before 1 year of age: a retrospective reviews of 22 cases in an 11-year period (1977-1987). Congenital brain tumors have been reported infrequently and their management remains ill defined. An 11-year review (1977-1987) of all children with brain tumors with the onset of symptoms before 1 year of age was completed. Twenty-two children with the following histological diagnoses were treated: astrocytoma (7 patients), primitive neuroectodermal tumor (6 patients), papilloma or carcinoma of the choroid plexus (3 patients), malignant teratoma (2 patients), dermoid tumor (2 patients), embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (1 patient), and chloroma (1 patient). Fifteen tumors were supratentorial in location, and 7 were infratentorial. Initial symptoms were hydrocephalus (32%), focal neurological deficit (23%), asymptomatic increase in head circumference (18%), failure to thrive (14%), and seizures (4.5%). The goal of treatment was a radical excision when possible, with primary chemotherapy in the last 6 years of the review period. Radiation therapy was the adjunct to surgery in the initial 5-year period. All patients with papillomas of the choroid plexus and dermoid lesions underwent a total resection with no recurrence. All 7 astrocytomas were supratentorial, with 6 occurring in the diencephalon. Five of the seven patients with astrocytomas survived more than 5 years. The 6 primitive neuroectodermal tumors were located equally between the supra- and infratentorial spaces. Four of the 6 infants with these tumors received chemotherapy (2 received chemotherapy alone; 2 received chemotherapy and radiation therapy) and are tumor free 2 to 9 years later. A fifth child received radiation therapy alone early in the series and survived only 4 months. The family of the other child refused adjunctive treatment. 
Caring for older patients with high blood pressure. Hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, is common in older patients. Optimal selection of antihypertensive therapy in the elderly requires consideration of the unique risks, physiology and concomitant illnesses in this age group. Since the U.S. population is aging rapidly, appropriate management of hypertension in older patients is likely to remain an important concern. 
Current role of digitalis therapy in patients with congestive heart failure. Digitalis has been used in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure for 215 years. In this article, numerous clinical studies and trials that have evaluated the efficacy of digitalis in the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure are reviewed. The data indicate that digitalis is a valuable therapeutic agent for relieving symptoms and improving exercise performance and left ventricular function in patients with congestive heart failure. Comparison of the various advantages and disadvantages of digitalis with alternative therapies in patients with congestive heart failure shows an important continuing role for digitalis therapy. 
Persistence of symptoms after gall bladder clearance with cholecystolithotripsy. Forty six patients rendered stone and fragment free with successful cholecystolithotripsy without the use of oral chemolitholysis were followed by serial ultrasound for a period of two to 25 months (mean 11 months, median 10 months). Seven patients (15%), six of whom remain asymptomatic, developed recurrent calculi. Of the 39 gall stone free patients, 26 were asymptomatic. Six patients complained of persistent abdominal pain similar to that before treatment. One of these had a bile duct stone. Seven patients complained of a variety of non-biliary symptoms. The patient with recurrent gall stones and recurrent symptoms is eligible for further lithotripsy treatment. The overall 30% incidence of persistent abdominal symptoms is similar to that reported after elective cholecystectomy. 
Relevance of common tests of cerebrospinal fluid in screening for bacterial meningitis. This study tests the hypothesis that if cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has a nucleated blood cell count (NucBC) of less than 6/mm3, CSF tests other than bacterial culture need not be performed to exclude the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis in patients not receiving antimicrobial agents. The results of tests performed on the first specimen of CSF obtained for a given hospital visit from children younger than 3 years of age, exclusive of newborn infants admitted to the hospital on their date of birth, were analyzed. Of 3356 CSF specimens evaluated, 122 were from patients with bacterial meningitis; 460 specimens were analyzed separately because the erythrocyte count was greater than 1000/mm3. A negative CSF screening test result was defined as a CSF NucBC less than 6/mm3. In facilitating the diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, this screening test had a sensitivity of 98.4%, a specificity of 75.2%, and a negative predictive value of 99.9%. The other CSF tests varied widely in screening effectiveness: a Gram-stained smear had a sensitivity of 53% and a specificity of 97%. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the screening relevance of CSF tests. The CSF NucBC and CSF segmented NucBC performed indistinguishably and superiorly compared with the CSF protein or glucose concentration and the ratio of CSF glucose to serum glucose concentration. Logistic regression analysis showed that the NucBC alone is superior to any combination of the other CSF tests. In a prospective study of 215 children younger than 3 years of age undergoing a lumbar puncture in our emergency department, 85% had empiric criteria identifying them as appropriate for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. The CSF NucBC was less than 6/mm3 in 70% of the 181 patients who would have been eligible for an abbreviated CSF evaluation. These data suggest that a strategy for the sequential testing of CSF could be adopted that would exclude unnecessary determinations and thereby save time, effort, and health care dollars. 
Influence of local recurrence on survival: a controversy reviewed from the perspective of soft tissue sarcoma. The relationship between local recurrence and survival has been examined using the example of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. Studies that appear to indicate that local recurrence does not jeopardize survival are shown to have been inappropriately analysed, to have inadequate patient numbers, or both. A survival deficit due to local tumour recurrence cannot be excluded on present data, and clinical decisions regarding conservative versus radical surgery will therefore continue to involve an element of value judgement. 
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with infantile spasms in five mentally retarded children: a morphological analysis on mesangiolysis. We report five cases of nephrotic syndrome due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) in mentally retarded children with severe infantile spasms. Four of the five children diagnosed as West syndrome, Lennox syndrome, or petit mal epilepsy also had cerebral palsy and microcephaly. The other patient had petit mal epilepsy without cerebral palsy and microcephaly. All patients first developed infantile spasms, with the time of onset ranging from 1 week to 2 years of age, and subsequently developed proteinuria, followed by the nephrotic syndrome at 3 to 14 years of age. Four of the five developed terminal renal failure between 7 and 11 years of age. Three subsequently died, but the other underwent kidney transplantation and is still living without further complications. The light, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical studies performed on the renal biopsies from all the patients and on the autopsy specimens from two cases exhibited FSGS-like lesions. Besides segmental hyalinosis, differing degrees of mesangiolysis were seen, which sometimes developed into dissecting microaneurysms of the glomerular capillary loops. The clinical picture described can be differentiated from congenital nephrotic syndrome (CNS) or infantile nephrotic syndrome (INS) with respect to the age of onset, outcome, and morphological appearance. We reviewed the previous literature and extended earlier observations about an unusual association between the nephrotic syndrome due to FSGS-like lesion, mental retardation, infantile spasms, and/or microcephaly in children. 
Timing for implantation and transplantation in mechanical bridge to transplantation. The implantation of a mechanical blood pump in a deteriorating candidate for heart transplantation is indicated in general if the cardiac index is less than 1.9 L/min/m2 despite maximal inotropic support. Deterioration of end organ function may be taken as a second factor indicating the need for mechanical support as patients with acute onset of shock may react differently from patients with chronic deterioration. Preoperative need for dialysis largely reduces the chances of long-term survival. The time on support should be long enough to normalize or at least improve secondarily damaged organ systems, but with time infectious and thromboembolic complications will increase. So optimal periods for artificial heart support range between two days and four weeks. Age less than 40 years is a positive predictor for outcome in TAH bridging. The general guidelines, however, do not preclude a favourable outcome in complicated cases, as we show in our own series. 
Survivorship analysis of the uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee replacement [published erratum appears in J Bone Joint Surg [Am] 1991 Sep;73(8):1274] Ninety-six patients who had a total of 108 replacements with an uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee prosthesis were followed for an average of sixty-four months (range, thirty-nine to ninety-three months). At the time of the most recent follow-up, twenty-one implants (19 per cent) had failed, all due to problems with the tibial component. A patellar component was not used, and no noteworthy patellar problems were encountered after the operation. There were no infections about the prostheses, and no femoral implant was revised. The most common cause of failure was collapse of the anteromedial part of the tibial plateau, which occurred in fourteen knees. The prosthesis loosened without collapse of bone in two knees, and five knees were revised because of gross wear of the polyethylene. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which revision of the prosthesis was recommended, the cumulative rate of survival was 84 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval, +/- 7 per cent) at five years and 77 +/- 10 per cent at six years. When the time of failure was defined as the point at which the knee replacement was actually done, the five-year rate of survival was the same. No significant differences were demonstrated between groups that were stratified by age, sex, weight, or primary diagnosis. We therefore do not recommend the use of an uncemented porous-coated anatomic knee replacement of the design that was evaluated in this study. 
Inactivation of the Zfx gene on the mouse X chromosome [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Jul 1;88(13):5937] ZFX, an X chromosome-linked gene encoding a zinc-finger protein, has previously been shown to escape X inactivation in humans. Here we report studies of the inactivation status of the homolog, Zfx, on the mouse X chromosome. We took advantage of both the preferential inactivation of the normal X chromosome in females carrying the T(X;16)16H translocation and the high degree of nucleotide sequence variation between the laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] and Mus spretus genomes. An EcoRV restriction fragment difference between laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] and M. spretus was detected after amplification of Zfx transcripts using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Using this allelic variation, we assessed expression of the two Zfx genes in females carrying the T(X;16)16H translocation (from laboratory strain of mouse [corrected]) and an intact X chromosome (from M. spretus). Such females exhibit Zfx transcription from the active laboratory strain of mouse [corrected] chromosome but not from the inactive M. spretus chromosome. These results indicate that the mouse Zfx gene is subject to X inactivation. 
Polymerase chain reaction identification of human papillomavirus DNA in CO2 laser plume from recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA was identified in the plume produced during CO2 laser vaporization of respiratory tract papillomata. The plume produced from CO2 vaporization was collected on Gelfoam pledgets that were affixed to suction tips evacuating the vapor plume from the operative field. The Gelfoam pledgets were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, processed, and examined for HPV-6 and HPV-11 DNA by a polymerase chain reaction technique. Tissue and vapor-plume specimens were collected from 22 patients undergoing CO2 laser excision of laryngeal lesions. Seven patients had adult-onset recurrent respiratory laryngeal papillomatosis (RRP), 12 had juvenile-onset RRP, two had laryngeal carcinoma, and one had nonspecific laryngitis. HPV-6 or HPV-11 was identified in 17 of 27 vapor-plume specimens from RRP and in none of three from non-RRP lesions. All but one RRP tissue specimen contained HPV-DNA, and none of the non-RRP tissues contained HPV-DNA. When HPV was present in vapor, the same HPV type was found in the corresponding tissue specimen. Identification of HPV-DNA in the laser plume raises concern regarding potential risks from exposure to the plume--particularly to the endoscopic surgeon and the operating team. The practical concerns and effectiveness of the plume scavenging systems are discussed. 
Race and the self-reported health of elderly persons. This research examined race differences in the structure and measurement of six self-reports of health that are widely used in studies of elderly persons. Second-order confirmatory factor analyses (LISREL) revealed race differences only in the validity of subjective interpretations of health state and in the measurement error of a chronic conditions indicator. No race differences were found in the form of the four-factor model of self-reported health. Results, interpreted within a cognitive illness-labeling framework, have implications for future race-comparative health research. 
Peritonitis due to Rhizopus in a patient undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. A 61-year-old man who had end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension developed peritonitis due to infection with Rhizopus as a complication of receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). At the onset of infection, the patient was neither acidemic nor hyperglycemic; in addition, deferoxamine had not been administered and Elastoplast dressings had not been applied. The infection occurred after the technique for disinfection of the catheter used for CAPD had been changed. The catheter was removed, and therapy with amphotericin B was initiated. Although the patient died of apparently unrelated causes, an autopsy revealed active fungal infection with multiple abscesses and superficial invasion of the ileal wall. 
A case for early surgery in native left-sided endocarditis complicated by heart failure: results in 203 patients From January 1982 to December 1988, 203 consecutive patients were selected for early valve replacement (mean 10 days from time of admission) if they had clinical evidence of native valve endocarditis with 1) vegetations on echocardiography, 2) severe valvular lesions, and 3) heart failure. Surgery was performed within 7 days of admission in 56% of patients and was done urgently because of hemodynamic deterioration in 108 (53%). All vegetations were identified by echocardiography and confirmed macroscopically at surgery. One hundred ten patients had isolated aortic valve infection, 50 had isolated mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05 for aortic vs. mitral) and 43 had double-valve infection. Mean aortic cross-clamp time was 57, 38 and 67 min, respectively. Sixty-four patients (32%) had extensive infection involving the anulus or adjacent tissues, or both; such infection more frequently involved the aortic than the mitral valve (p less than 0.05). Thirty-eight patients (35%) with aortic valve infection had abscess formation compared with 1 patient (2%) with mitral valve infection (p less than 0.05). Only eight patients (4%) died in the hospital. There were seven patients (3%) with a periprosthetic leak and five patients (3%) with early prosthetic valve endocarditis. Long-term follow-up, available in 174 hospital survivors (89%), revealed 10 deaths and two new ring leaks at 38 +/- 22 months. In conclusion, among patients with endocarditis who need surgery for heart failure, aortic valve infection is more prevalent than mitral valve infection and is more often associated with extensive infection, including abscess formation. 
Human immunodeficiency virus-related lymphomas: a possible association between tumor proliferation, lack of ploidy anomalies, and immune deficiency In an attempt to identify a biologic basis for the aggressive clinical behavior of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated lymphomas (HAL), dual-parameter flow-cytometric analysis was performed on 22 paraffin-embedded biopsy specimens. Cases were analyzed for DNA ploidy, the percentage of cells in S-phase (proliferative activity), and content of a recently identified proliferation-associated nuclear antigen, p105. The DNA-content analysis of 22 HALs was compared with that of 109 cases of intermediate-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) unrelated to the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) studied previously in our laboratory and 125 cases of high-grade NHL reported in the literature. The proliferative activity was higher in intermediate-grade HAL relative to non-AIDS NHL (24.0% v 10.4%; P = .03), and in high-grade HAL in comparison with NHLs of similar histology unassociated with HIV infection (24.8% v 19%), although the latter did not reach statistical significance. The number of mitoses per 10 high-power fields was found to correlate with the percentage of cells in S-phase (r = .68; P = .0004). Although p105 content tended to be higher in HAL than in an AIDS-related complex (ARC)-associated hyperplastic lymph node control, no statistically significant associations were found between p105 content and proliferative activity or the number of mitoses per 10 high-power fields. When compared with non-AIDS NHLs of comparable grade, there was a trend toward a lower incidence of DNA aneuploidy in both intermediate- (25% v 56%) and high-grade (38.5% v 60%) HALs. The higher proliferative activity and lower incidence of DNA aneuploidy found in HAL relative to non-AIDS NHL of comparable histologic grade may represent differences in pathogenesis and may underlie the poor prognosis of HIV-associated NHL. 
Estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors and heat-shock 27-kD protein in liver biopsy specimens from patients with hepatitis B virus infection. It has been proposed that in the human liver, the estrogen receptor gene may become inappropriately expressed as a consequence of HBV integration, contributing to cell transformation. This study was undertaken to examine estrogen receptor status in patients with hepatitis B virus infection and to analyze the expression of progesterone receptor and of a heat-shock 27,000-D protein (hsp27), both of which are estrogen regulated in estrogen target tissues. Receptor proteins were detected in liver biopsy specimens by immunocytochemistry using antireceptor monoclonal antibodies; a monoclonal antibody was also used to detect hsp27. Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor were mainly seen in the nuclei of hepatocytes. The presence of hepatitis B virus infection did not always result in elevated estrogen receptor expression, but in general the expression of this receptor protein was higher in hepatitis B virus-positive patients than in patients with the same pathological findings (hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocarcinoma) but without hepatitis B virus. This was more clearly seen in the patients with hepatitis. Although estrogen receptor expression was moderate to high in many samples, the expression of the two biochemical markers of estrogen action at postreceptor levels (progesterone receptor and hsp27) was low or absent in most of the liver tissues examined, suggesting that in the liver the interaction of estrogen-estrogen receptor-DNA has characteristics inherent to this tissue. 
Perspectives on human response to health and illness. Nursing's domain has been defined as the diagnosis and treatment of human responses to health problems, yet debate rages over what "human responses" are. Without clear meanings for this and other terms used in nursing, the profession cannot claim that its practice is scientifically based, nor can it share that base among disciplines. 
Recurrent abdominal pain due to chronic appendiceal disease. Recurrent appendicitis and chronic appendicitis are the subjects of much controversy, but long-standing inflammation of the appendix and surrounding tissues has been reported in rare instances. We have described two patients, both with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, who subsequently were shown to have chronic appendiceal disease. Appendiceal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with recurrent abdominal pain. 
Intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia in children after selective dorsal root rhizotomy. The authors report their experience with low doses (0.007-0.015 mg/kg), moderate doses (0.016-0.025 mg/kg), and high doses (0.026-0.035 mg/kg) of intrathecal morphine for postoperative analgesia after selective dorsal root rhizotomy surgery in 50 children, aged 3 to 12 years. After closure of the dura, a single dose of preservative-free morphine was injected into the subarachnoid space, and patients were assessed for 48 hours for level of comfort and side effects. The three doses of morphine provided equivalent analgesia and similar side effects. The duration of postoperative analgesia ranged from 3 to 48 hours (mean, 12.2 +/- 9.5 h). Common side effects were limited to nausea and vomiting (42%) and mild facial pruritus. No patient experienced late respiratory depression or generalized pruritus. The authors conclude that low doses of intrathecal morphine is as effective as moderate or high doses of morphine for reducing pain in the immediate postoperative period. Intrathecal morphine provides excellent analgesia after selective dorsal rhizotomy. 
The effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on renal growth, function and arterial blood pressure in an animal model. The long-term effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) on children treated for renal calculi are unclear. To study the long-term bio-effects of this mode of treatment on the immature animal we evaluated 30 New Zealand white rabbits at 7 weeks of age for weight, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and arterial blood pressure after which they underwent left nephrectomy. Each group of 5 rabbits received ESWL of varying levels (500 to 3,000 shock waves) to the remaining right kidney using the Northgate SD3 lithotriptor (spark gap mediated). One control group received no shock waves. At maturity (16 weeks) the aforementioned parameters were measured again, and the kidneys and any grossly abnormal adjacent organs were examined. We found no significant change in total animal growth, renal growth, renal function or perirenal organs in the post-ESWL groups versus the control group. All post-ESWL groups had an increase in mean arterial blood pressure versus the control group with 3 of 6 groups showing significant increases (p less than 0.05). Histological renal changes, seen at all energy levels of ESWL delivered, included interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, glomeruli destruction, capsular thickening, perivascular fibrosis and mild arteriole wall thickening. Changes were proportional to the number of shocks received. We conclude that ESWL delivered to immature animals does not significantly affect renal growth and function but it can cause significant permanent histological renal changes even at low doses and may result in an increase in adult mean arterial blood pressure. 
The pharmacology of stuttering: a critical review. OBJECTIVE: The author critically examines the limited world literature on pharmacologic treatments of stuttering. METHOD: The literature on stuttering and drugs was identified by means of two computer-assisted searches. FINDINGS: A great variety of pharmacologic agents have been used to treat stuttering, reflecting the many theories about the origin and nature of the disorder. In some instances new hypotheses about the nature of stuttering have followed the chance discovery of agents having some efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Few studies have used adequate experimental designs. Promising avenues of research, both for the treatment of stuttering and for exploring its nature, include the use of calcium channel blocking agents and cholinergic drugs. 
Management of ventricular septal defect with associated aortic incompetence. Twenty-two patients with a ventricular septal defect and aortic incompetence underwent surgical repair. Mean age was 9.6 years (range, 9 to 15 years). Mean follow-up was 32.4 +/- 15.8 months. The ventricular septal defect was perimembranous in 19 patients and doubly committed or juxtaarterial in 3. Most showed only a small left-to-right shunt. Mean diameter was 11.9 +/- 4.8 mm. Aortic incompetence was mild in 6 patients, moderate in 4, and severe in 12. In 16 patients closure of the ventricular septal defect and aortic valvoplasty were both performed through the aortic root. There were no deaths. All patients retained normal sinus rhythm. No complete heart block was found. In 3 patients secondary aortic valve replacement was required for severe incompetence; in 1 the cause was bacterial endocarditis, in another technical failure, and in a third progressive incompetence over an 8-month period. All patients showed substantial clinical improvement, marked decrease or disappearance of the valvar incompetence, diminution of the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, and decreased cardiothoracic ratio. We conclude that primary repair is the operation of choice for this combination of lesions. This can avoid or delay considerably valvar replacement. The left-sided approach proves safe and is our preferred technique. 
Characterization of childhood acute leukemia with multiple myeloid and lymphoid markers at diagnosis and at relapse. To define the clinical and biologic significance of childhood acute mixed-lineage leukemia diagnosed by stringent criteria, we studied 25 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia expressing greater than or equal to 2 myeloid-associated antigens (My+ ALL), and 16 cases of acute myeloid leukemia expressing greater than or equal to 2 lymphoid associated antigens (Ly+ AML). These cases represented 6.1% of 410 newly diagnosed ALLs (two treatment protocols) and 16.8% of 95 AMLs (two protocols). T-lineage--associated antigens were identified in 9 of the My+ ALL cases and in 14 of those classified as Ly+ AML; all but 1 of the 19 cases that could be subclassified had an early thymocyte stage of differentiation. The My+ ALL cases had an increased frequency of French-American-British (FAB) L2 morphology (36%); the Ly+ AML cases were characterized by FAB M1 or M2 morphology, low levels of myeloperoxidase reactivity and combined populations of myeloperoxidase-positive large blasts and small blasts generally of hand-mirror morphology. Karyotypic abnormalities included t(9;22)(q34;q11) in three cases of My+ ALL, 11q23 translocations in two cases of My+ ALL, and 14q32 translocations in three My+ ALL and five Ly+ AML cases. Mixed-lineage expression lacked prognostic significance in either ALL or AML; however, the findings indicate that some patients with Ly+ AML may respond to prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase after failing on protocols for myeloid leukemia. At relapse, two My+ ALLs had converted to AML and two Ly+ AMLs to ALL; one case in each group showed complete replacement of the original karyotype. Acute mixed-lineage leukemia does not adequately describe the heterogeneity of the cases identified in this study and should be replaced by a set of more restrictive terms that indicate the unique biologic features of these leukemias. 
A new technique for sheathless percutaneous intraaortic balloon catheter insertion. Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation is helpful for controlling myocardial ischemia and providing hemodynamic support, but its applicability is limited by lower extremity ischemic complications in a significant percentage of patients. We developed a new sheathless technique for percutaneous intraaortic balloon catheter insertion which reduces the effective catheter diameter. A pilot study using this new technique resulted in a 10% rate of limb ischemia, without compromise of balloon function. We conclude that this technique may be useful in reducing the incidence of limb ischemia associated with intraaortic balloon counterpulsation. 
A mutation in the tRNA(Leu)(UUR) gene associated with the MELAS subgroup of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are usually divided into three distinct clinical subgroups: (1) mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); (2) myoclonus epilepsy associated with ragged-red fibres (MERRF); and (3) chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) including Kearns-Sayre syndrome. Large deletions of human mitochondrial DNA and a transition mutation at the mitochondrial transfer RNALys gene give rise to CPEO including Kearns-Sayre syndrome and MERRF, respectively. Here we report an A-to-G transition mutation at nucleotide pair 3,243 in the dihydrouridine loop of mitochondrial tRNA(Leu)(UUR) that is specific to patients with MELAS. Because this mutation creates an ApaI restriction site, we could perform a simple molecular diagnostic test for the disease. The mutation was present in 26 out of 31 independent MELAS patients and 1 out of 29 CPEO patients, but absent in the 5 MERRF and 50 controls tested. Southern blot analysis confirmed that the mutant DNA always coexists with the wild-type DNA (heteroplasmy). 
Omega-3 fatty acids in health and disease and in growth and development. Several sources of information suggest that man evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega 6 to omega 3 fatty acids of approximately 1 whereas today this ratio is approximately 10:1 to 20-25:1, indicating that Western diets are deficient in omega 3 fatty acids compared with the diet on which humans evolved and their genetic patterns were established. Omega-3 fatty acids increase bleeding time; decrease platelet aggregation, blood viscosity, and fibrinogen; and increase erythrocyte deformability, thus decreasing the tendency to thrombus formation. In no clinical trial, including coronary artery graft surgery, has there been any evidence of increased blood loss due to ingestion of omega 3 fatty acids. Many studies show that the effects of omega 3 fatty acids on serum lipids depend on the type of patient and whether the amount of saturated fatty acids in the diet is held constant. In patients with hyperlipidemia, omega 3 fatty acids decrease low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol if the saturated fatty acid content is decreased, otherwise there is a slight increase, but at high doses (32 g) they lower LDL cholesterol; furthermore, they consistently lower serum triglycerides in normal subjects and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia whereas the effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) varies from no effect to slight increases. The discrepancies between animal and human studies most likely are due to differences between animal and human metabolism. In clinical trials eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the form of fish oils along with antirheumatic drugs improve joint pain in patients with rheumatoid arthritis; have a beneficial effect in patients with ulcerative colitis; and in combination with drugs, improve the skin lesions, lower the hyperlipidemia from etretinates, and decrease the toxicity of cyclosporin in patients with psoriasis. In various animal models omega 3 fatty acids decrease the number and size of tumors and increase the time elapsed before appearance of tumors. Studies with nonhuman primates and human newborns indicate that DHA is essential for the normal functional development of the retina and brain, particularly in premature infants. Because omega 3 fatty acids are essential in growth and development throughout the life cycle, they should be included in the diets of all humans. Omega-3 and omega 6 fatty acids are not interconvertible in the human body and are important components of practically all cell membranes. Whereas cellular proteins are genetically determined, the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) composition of cell membranes is to a great extent dependent on the dietary intake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Effect of altered activation sequence on epicardial QRST area and refractory period in dogs. BACKGROUND. We investigated the effects of activation sequence on cardiac surface QRST areas and refractory periods in experiments on dogs. METHODS AND RESULTS. Right and left ventricular pacings were performed, and the pacing site was altered every 6 minutes. After 4 minutes of a given pacing, 54 unipolar electrograms distributed over the entire cardiac surface were recorded. Next, refractory periods at electrode sites near pacing electrodes were measured. Paired right ventricular/left ventricular (RV/LV) pacing data were obtained six or seven times in each sample. Although the QRST isoarea maps during the two activation orders were qualitatively similar, it was recognized consistently from the right ventricle-left ventricle difference map that leads around the RV free wall had positive values and that leads around the LV free wall and apex had negative values. Compared with the same leads at RV and LV pacing, QRST areas were larger when pacing sites were near the leads. The local QRST areas of individual leads at which we measured local refractory period were consistently larger during drive from proximal pacing sites than during drive from distant pacing sites. Refractory periods were consistently longer during proximal pacing than during distal pacing, and there was a positive correlation between change in local QRST area and change in refractory period (r = 0.64) during altered activation sequence, whereas there was an inverse correlation between change in QRST area and change in refractory period (r = -0.91) during localized myocardial warming. CONCLUSIONS. Both local QRST areas and local refractory periods were dependent on the activation sequence, and there was a positive correlation between QRST areas and refractory periods during various activation sequences compared with localized myocardial warming. 
Dramatic response of follicular thyroid carcinoma with superior vena cava syndrome and tracheal obstruction to external-beam radiotherapy. We report a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma progressing to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome and tracheal obstruction despite multiple doses of radioactive iodine therapy but subsequently responding dramatically to external-beam radiotherapy (RT). Although RT is not considered to be the treatment of choice for follicular carcinoma, RT in our patient produced unequivocal improvement of SVC syndrome and tracheal obstruction. 
Venous thromboembolism after brain tumor surgery: a retrospective review. We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of clinical postoperative deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in 1703 patients undergoing initial craniotomy for meningioma, glioma, or cerebral metastasis. The incidence rate of clinical thromboembolic complications was 1.59% for all tumor groups within the first 4 weeks of surgery. Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups. The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively. Whether this difference was a result of increased surgical time or an inherent property of meningiomas could not be ascertained. 
Assessment of the human coronary circulation using a Doppler catheter. Arteriographic estimates of stenosis severity can fail to reflect the impact of an individual stenosis on delivery of blood to the myocardium. Whether a coronary stenosis is truly flow-limiting can be determined by measuring hyperemic blood flow or coronary flow reserve; however, until recently, the tools needed to measure coronary flow reserve in humans--namely, a method of quantitating coronary blood flow in individual arteries and another method for producing maximal microvascular vasodilation--were not available. Over the last 8 years, our laboratory group has developed a catheter for measuring coronary blood flow velocity in humans, using the Doppler principle, and studied the effects of microvascular vasodilators. These studies have enabled us to measure coronary flow reserve in humans and to characterize some of the effects of focal and diffuse atherosclerosis on the coronary circulation. In addition, we have used flow reserve measurements in the diagnosis of microvascular dysfunction in patients with chest pain and normal coronary arteries and as a means of assessing noninvasive methods for detecting focal coronary artery disease. 
Phenotypic heterogeneity in the syndromes of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Combined 3-methylglutaconic and 3-methylglutaric aciduria, one of the more common urinary organic acid abnormalities, has been observed in at least three clinical syndromes. We studied an additional seven patients with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, four of whom were best categorized as having the type II syndrome, two as having an "unspecified" syndrome, and one who may have had a primary urea cycle defect. In cultured cells and autopsy tissues derived from patients with the type II and unspecified syndromes, we were unsuccessful in identifying a defect in the leucine degradative pathway distal to 3-methylcrotonyl-coenzyme A carboxylase and in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway between 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase. Further assessment of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in several patients with one of the two types of disease also provided no defined abnormality. The primary metabolic defects in the type II and unspecified syndromes remain undefined. 
Outpatient liver biopsy: one man's experience. As an academically based gastroenterologist, I performed 94 outpatient liver biopsies over a 42-month period, using the standard suction technique. Differential blood count and vital signs were monitored, with no statistically significant postbiopsy changes noted in the group at large. One patient required admission to the hospital for bleeding, and six patients required intramuscular analgesics for pain at the biopsy site. Four patients had bradycardia, and one of them required atropine for bradycardia and hypotension. Outpatient liver biopsy is a safe procedure with low morbidity and complication rate. It would appear that prolonged monitoring is not necessary. 
Clinical anatomic study of pure dysarthria. Nine patients with pure dysarthria underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Eight patients had infarcts of lacunar or larger size in the internal capsule: four in the superior portion of the anterior limb or adjacent corona radiata and four in the superior portion of the genu or the adjacent corona radiata. In one patient, there was a small infarct in the bulbar motor cortex. Dysarthria was transient and characterized by poor articulation in all cases. Five patients also had contralateral facial weakness, and three patients with lesions in the genu had minimal and transient involvement of the contralateral fingers. These three cases appeared to be variants of the dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome. We submit that this syndrome should sometimes be regarded as a stroke syndrome rather than always as a lacunar syndrome. 
Cervicomedullary junction decompression in a case of Marshall-Smith syndrome. Case report. The case is reported of a 2-year-old boy born with Marshall-Smith syndrome who had difficulty in swallowing and who exhibited spasticity and quadriparesis due to compression of the medulla and cervical spine. This is the first child with this rare condition reported to have brain-stem compression from bone abnormalities at the craniovertebral junction and who has required surgery. 
Effect of intrathecal fibrinolytic therapy on clot lysis and vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. A prospective series of 30 patients with a single, angiographically verified aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) was studied for the effect of intrathecal thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) on outcome, angiographic vasospasm, and computerized tomography (CT) findings after surgery. The patients included fulfilled the following criteria: operation was performed by Day 3 after the hemorrhage, CT showed only blood in the basal cisterns, and the patient had a single aneurysm or multiple aneurysms that could be treated surgically at the same operation. The patients were divided into groups of 10, with patients receiving 3, 10, or 13 mg of rt-PA in a single intracisternal injection at the end of the operation. There were no differences between the treatment groups in overall outcome. One patient from the 3-mg rt-PA group developed a postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage, and one patient from the 10-mg rt-PA group had a postoperative epidural hematoma. There was one death in the 13-mg rt-PA group that was caused by inclusion of a segment of pericallosal artery in the clip. In all treatment groups a reduction was observed in the amount of blood seen on the postoperative CT scans compared to the preoperative CT scans. The reduction in SAH grade between the 10-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was significant (p less than 0.05). The difference in the severity of angiographic vasospasm between the 3-mg and 13-mg rt-PA groups was also significant (p less than 0.05). 
Efficacy and safety of a perioperative enoxaparin regimen in total hip replacement under various anesthesias. Four trials in which enoxaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, was used in patients having hip surgery are reported. In the first two trials, enoxaparin was given before general anesthesia. The protocol consisted of 40 mg of enoxaparin, 4,000 anti-factor Xa IU, subcutaneously 12 hours before surgery, followed by the same dose 12 hours after surgery and then once daily. In the third trial, this protocol was compared with unfractionated heparin calcium given in a standardized manner and appeared to be significantly superior both in efficacy and tolerance. In the fourth trial, the protocol was adapted for use in spinal subarachnoidal anesthesia; 20 mg of enoxaparin, 2,000 anti-factor Xa IU, was given subcutaneously 1 hour after anesthesia and 40 mg 12 hours later. In all these trials tolerance was good. Excessive bleeding did not occur with the 40 mg once daily regimen. Efficacy was good and compared favorably with other protocols in use. 
Calcium channel blockers. Potential medical benefits and side effects. Calcium channel blockers are recently developed antihypertensive drugs. In terms of mechanisms of action, their specificity is not so well established as that of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors but is better understood than that for diuretics or adrenergic-inhibiting drugs. Calcium channel blockers were originally developed for treatment of angina but were found to lower arterial pressure as well. Three of them are now in wide use in the United States; their therapeutic spectrum in regard to type of hypertension is broad. Sublingual nifedipine has replaced intravenously administered vasodilators as immediate treatment of severe hypertension, and all three drugs, given orally, have been shown to be effective in mild, moderate, and severe hypertension. The three drugs available in this country are verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine. Pharmacological studies have shown that verapamil has the most negative chronotropic and inotropic effects of the three, with nifedipine producing the most vasodilation and having the potential for causing reflex tachycardia. Actually in practice, these various pharmacological differences have proved to have less significance than previously thought, and the drugs seem to have about equal antihypertensive effectiveness. Comparisons of calcium entry blockers with other drugs have shown them to be equally effective in whites as propranolol but more effective in blacks. Responsiveness appears to be related, as well, to pretreatment plasma renin activity and age. Thus, the antihypertensive effect is directly related to age and inversely related to plasma renin activity. The side effects mostly relate to vasodilation, reflex tachycardia, palpitations, headache, and edema; they are not frequent, and the drugs are well tolerated. 
Influence of phlebographic abnormalities on the natural history of venous ulceration. Eighty-five limbs in 73 patients with a healed venous ulcer were assessed by ascending and descending phlebography, foot volume plethysmography and transcutaneous oxygen measurements. Forty-four limbs had post-thrombotic changes on ascending phlebography. In 24 (28 per cent) these extended into the femoral vein, while in 20 (24 per cent) only the calf veins were involved. In the 41 limbs (48 per cent) with normal deep veins on ascending phlebography, 11 had evidence of localized incompetence of the calf communicating veins, 14 had either long saphenous incompetence, deep vein reflux to the level of the knee or below, or both of these abnormalities, and 16 limbs had no phlebographic abnormalities. However all limbs had a decreased half volume refilling time on foot volume plethysmography. Limbs with post-thrombotic changes extending into the femoral vein were associated with a significantly longer history of ulceration and more ulcer recurrences than limbs with calf vein damage (P less than 0.05 for each) and limbs with normal deep veins (P less than 0.01 for each). However, these limbs did not have lower transcutaneous oxygen ratios or longer times to achieve ulcer healing. Ascending phlebography identified a group of limbs with extensive post-thrombotic changes in which there was a higher incidence of ulcer breakdown, but this was not associated with a delay in ulcer healing. 
Bradycardic responses to vagally mediated bedside maneuvers in healthy volunteers. PURPOSE: To determine the relative potency in healthy individuals of the vagally mediated reflexes used clinically to inhibit sinoatrial and atrioventricular node function. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers with no history of heart disease performed face immersion in cold water and the Valsalva maneuver twice, to maximum endurance and to the subjective point of first discomfort, and face immersion in warm water and the Muller maneuver to maximum endurance only. Right and left carotid massage and left, right, and bilateral eyeball compression were each performed for 15 seconds. Change in heart rate was taken as baseline minus the rate over the slowest three consecutive QRS cycles elicited by each maneuver. Fisher's least-significant-difference multiple comparison procedure was used to analyze heart rate responses. Significance was defined as p less than or equal to 0.05. RESULTS: Maximum pulse decrements from baseline and 95% confidence intervals in beats/minute were as follows: cold-water face immersion to maximum endurance 15.5 (12.3 to 18.5), cold-water face immersion to first discomfort 10.1 (6.7 to 13.1), Valsalva maneuver to maximum endurance 9.2 (6.3 to 12.4), Valsalva maneuver to first discomfort 8.3 (5.0 to 11.3), right carotid massage 7.3 (4.3 to 10.3), left carotid massage 5.2 (2.3 to 8.4), right eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), left eyeball compression 6.6 (3.6 to 9.5), bilateral eyeball compression 6.0 (3.1 to 9.2), warm-water face immersion 7.0 (3.2 to 9.8), and Muller maneuver 1.6 (-1.3 to 4.9). Bradycardia was significantly greater for cold-water immersion of the face performed to maximum endurance than for all other maneuvers. CONCLUSION: In healthy subjects, the diving reflex is the most potent of the vagally mediated reflexes utilized in clinical practice. Immersion of the face in cold water may prove effective at the bedside when other maneuvers fail to augment vagal tone adequately. 
Liver enzyme abnormalities in Parkinson's disease. If toxicant exposure contributes to the cause of Parkinson's disease, poor function of detoxifying enzymes could increase vulnerability for Parkinson's disease. Although no hepatic enzyme system has been shown universally to be dysfunctional in Parkinson's disease patients, several have been suggested to be dysfunctional in subgroups, such as those with young age at disease onset. Specific enzymes implicated include several P450 enzymes, most notably P450 IID6, and cysteine dioxygenase. If hepatic enzyme abnormalities contribute to the development of Parkinson's disease, molecular genetic techniques may allow the development of screening tests to identify at-risk subjects in order to intervene with protective therapies.

Splenectomy does not correlate with length of survival in patients undergoing curative total gastrectomy for gastric carcinoma. Univariate and multivariate analyses. The relationship between splenectomy and survival time after curative total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer was examined by reviewing retrospectively data on 252 patients treated in our clinics between 1965 and 1985. One hundred three patients (40.9%) did not undergo splenectomy and 149 (59.1%) did. In patients subjected to splenectomy, advanced stages of the malignancy were more frequent and metastasis was noticed in 8.1% of splenic hilar lymph nodes and in 10.1% of the lymph nodes associated with the splenic artery. A univariate analysis revealed that the survival time of patients with splenectomy was significantly less than those for whom splenectomy was not done (P less than 0.05). In a subgroup of our patients stratified to adjust for the stage of disease, there was no significant difference between the survival rates. Subsequently, multivariate analysis using the Cox regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and other covariates indicated that serosa invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor size were the most important prognostic factors, and there was no correlation whatever with splenectomy. Our findings rule out any relationship between splenectomy and length of survival time in patients undergoing curative total gastrectomy for advanced gastric cancer.
