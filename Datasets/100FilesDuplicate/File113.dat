4	Circus movement atrial flutter in the canine sterile pericarditis model. Differential effects of procainamide on the components of the reentrant pathway. To evaluate the mechanisms of action of procainamide on the components of the reentrant pathway, drug-induced changes in activation patterns, effective refractory periods (ERPs), and stimulation thresholds were analyzed in nine dogs with sterile pericarditis and sustained atrial flutter. Activation maps were based on 127 close bipolar recordings from a special "jacket" electrode. From the control map, 22 +/- 2 sites covering the slow zone and the normal zone of the reentrant circuit were selected to measure ERPs and thresholds. The excitable gap was estimated from the longest ERP during pacing at the tachycardia cycle length. During atrial flutter, epicardial activation proceeded as a single wave around an arc of functional conduction block in the proximity of the atrioventricular (AV) ring or around a combined functional/anatomic obstacle, with the arc being contiguous with one of the venae cavae. An area of slow conduction, which accounted for 53 +/- 15% of the revolution time within 35 +/- 15% of the total length of the reentrant pathway, was bordered by the arc of block and the AV ring or a caval vein and the AV ring, respectively. Procainamide (5-10 mg/kg i.v.) prolonged the cycle length of atrial flutter from 144 +/- 17 to 190 +/- 24 msec (p less than 0.05) and then terminated the arrhythmia in all studies. The increase in cycle length was due to an increase in conduction time in the slow zone by 37 +/- 11 msec (86 +/- 17% of the total cycle length increase). During the last reentrant beat, conduction failed in the slow zone, with the arc of block joining the AV ring. At termination, procainamide had prolonged conduction time, stimulation threshold, and ERP in the normal zone by 11 +/- 18%, 40 +/- 80%, and 5 +/- 15%, respectively, compared with 51 +/- 16%, 86 +/- 93%, and 14 +/- 21%, respectively, in the slow zone (p less than 0.05 for all three parameters). The duration of the excitable gap did not change significantly. We conclude that procainamide preferentially affected the slow zone of single loop reentrant circuits. The drug terminated circus movement atrial flutter without abolishing the excitable gap, and its effect on conduction seemed the major determinant of the antiarrhythmic action. 
4	Alcohol consumption and blood pressure: a comparison of native Japanese to American men. We compared the cross-sectional association of alcohol consumption with blood pressure in 810 Japanese men (JM) living in Tokyo and 946 white men (WM) living in New York. Mean systolic (JM and WM, p less than 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.001) were associated with alcohol consumption in both groups. Compared to abstainers, the heaviest drinkers had the highest systolic (JM, p = 0.001; WM, p less than 0.01) and diastolic (JM, p less than 0.002; WM, p less than 0.05) blood pressures. The relation of blood pressure to alcohol intake was J-shaped in the Americans, but linear in the Japanese. Exploratory analyses revealed that the J-shape may have been due to under-reporting of heavy alcohol ingestion by American abstainers. When abstainers were excluded, the relationships were similar in both the American and Japanese. The positive association between blood pressure and alcohol consumption persisted after adjustment for age, cigarette smoking, use of antihypertensive medications, body mass index, heart rate, abdominal skinfold thickness, hematocrit, fasting blood glucose, serum uric acid levels and urinary sodium/potassium ratio. Alcohol use was also related to prevalence of hypertension. These findings confirm the presence of an independent association between alcohol intake and blood pressure in both JM and WM and suggest that, despite differences in the metabolism of alcohol, the relation of alcohol consumption to blood pressure is similar in both nationalities. 
2	Plasma thrombin-antithrombin III complexes in the diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma complicating liver cirrhosis. Detection of hypercoagulable state might be helpful in the diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) complicating liver cirrhosis (LC). Plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) were determined in 50 patients of LC with or without HCC. The levels were above 2 ng/ml in 80% of 25 HCC patients, but only in 12% of 25 non-HCC patients (P less than 0.01). The levels over 2 ng/ml occurred even in five of six HCC patients whose serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were below 20 ng/ml as well as in two of three patients with HCC less than 2 cm in diameter. Those levels in HCC patients were significantly decreased within 8 days after treatment with transcatheter arterial embolization or infusion of antitumor agents, without affecting plasma antithrombin III levels. These results suggest that plasma TAT levels may be useful in the diagnosis of HCC complicating LC. 
1	Effective destruction of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 3 at 100 degrees C using the Semm cold coagulator: 14 years experience A total of 1628 women with CIN 3 treated with the Semm cold coagulator between 1975 and 1989 was followed primarily by cytology. The standard suitability criteria for ablation were adhered to except that patients were treated at their first visit when the colposcopist expected that the diagnosis would be no worse than CIN 3. Overall 97% of the women were treated at their first visit. In 30 women (2%) the histology was glandular or worse than expected, but 22 of these showed no persistent cervical disease subsequently. Follow-up was achieved for 87% at 10 years. In actuarial terms the primary success rate was 95% at 1 year and 92% at 5 years, it was similar for all age groups. Repeat cold-coagulation for persistent/recurrent CIN 3 was less successful and is not advised. The outcome for 226 pregnancies established after treatment is known. The rates for miscarriage, preterm or operative delivery were not increased. Cold-coagulation of CIN 3 at 100 degrees C as performed by us is as effective as any other treatment and calls into question the need for more expensive practices. 
3	Common headaches: type, duration, frequency and implications. Questionnaires completed by 327 preclinical medical and dental students showed that 97.9% had experienced headaches, most frequently attributed to insufficient sleep (38.8%), mental stress (38.8%), alcohol (38.5%), excess heat (36.7%), reading (31.5%), excess noise (29.9%) or light (27.7%), and sleeping too long (23.5%). The frequency and duration of these and other headaches are listed. 8% of the headache group had consulted a doctor. Only 2.1% of all students had never experienced a headache. Two hypotheses are examined: (1) can headaches be normal?--delineated by their disappearing soon after the noxious stimulus has ceased; (2) can pain in the head, as elsewhere in the body, act as a warning and therefore have protective, even survival value?. 
1	Correlation between hyperthermoradiosensitivity and clinical effect in carcinoma of the esophagus. The correlation between hyperthermoradiosensitivity evaluated by an in vitro succinate dehydrogenase inhibition (SDI) test and the histopathologic effects of hyperthermochemoradiotherapy (HCR therapy) were investigated in 43 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus. The succinate dehydrogenase (SD) activity of tissue fragments taken at biopsy was assayed after exposure to heat (43 degrees C.) and radiation (6 grays) was done. The sensitivity to radiation plus heat treatment was estimated by the percentage of SD activity of the treated cells, compared with that of the control cells. The 43 patients were divided into three groups according to the degree of SD activity after exposure to radiation plus heat treatment. The SD activity was less than 50 per cent in group 1 (highly sensitive), between 50 and 70 per cent in group 2 (moderately sensitive), more than 70 per cent in group 3 (less sensitive). Eighteen of 20 in group 1, 11 of 17 in group 2 and two of six in group 3 were classified as being histopathologically "effective" for HCR therapy. The two year survival rate for groups 1, 2 and 3 were 55.5, 34.9 and zero per cent, respectively, while there were no statistical differences with regard to prognostic factors. These data suggest that in vitro activities of SD correlate well with the clinical effectiveness of HCR therapy. Therefore, it is recommended that a SD inhibition test be included among the guidelines for clinical management. 
1	Tyrosine kinase and control of cell proliferation. The usefulness of phosphotyrosine antibodies for the detection of physiologically regulated or deregulated tyrosine kinases is discussed in this report. This rather rare enzymatic activity is shared by receptors for some polypeptide growth factors and by the products of Class 1 oncogenes. The antibodies are able to detect proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine in fibroblasts stimulated with growth factors such as EGF and PDGF. The major phosphorylated protein species are the receptors themselves, which undergo phosphorylation only after the addition of the exogenous factor and only transiently. Phosphotyrosine antibodies were able to detect the products of the retroviral Class 1 oncogenes, which are endowed with deregulated tyrosine kinase activity. In fact, in these cases a constitutive phosphorylation of the relevant proteins was observed, which occurred continuously and independently of the presence or lack of exogenous ligands. A tyrosine kinase constitutively activated in human gastric carcinoma cells was detected by P-Tyr antibodies. This molecule has been characterized at the molecular level, and the mechanisms responsible for its enzymatic activation have been investigated. The question of whether the tyrosine kinase identified is responsible for the induction and the maintenance of the transformed phenotype in gastric carcinomas remains to be answered. It is reasonable to suggest that this might be the case by analogy with other situations such as Class 1 oncogenes activated by transduction by retroviruses, abnormal expression of EGF receptors, or deregulated activity of c-abl-encoded proteins in chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Thus, the search for deregulated kinases by means of phosphotyrosine antibodies seems to be useful for identifying new activated oncogenes in clinical oncology. 
5	Secretion of a unique collagen by spontaneously transformed murine keratinocytes (PAM cells) in vitro. A spontaneously transformed murine keratinocyte cell line (PAM cell) was found to secrete two nondisulfide-linked collagenous polypeptides with apparent molecular weight (MW) 190-kd and 120-kd. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that the 190-kd polypeptide was secreted into the culture medium in 2 h and processed to the 120-kd collagen component within 4 h. This process was inhibited by EDTA. The 120-kd polypeptide was sensitive to pepsin, and a 50-kd fragment was produced by a mild pepsin treatment at 4 degrees C. A cyanogen bromide peptide map of the 120-kd polypeptide was distinct from that of types I, II, III, IV, and V collagens. These properties indicate similarities to the type VIII-related collagen produced by human astrocytoma cells. The secretion of the collagen rapidly reached a maximum level on the first day of culture and subsequently declined with cell proliferation. An accelerated processing to the 120-kd polypeptide was observed under culture conditions of high cell density. Similar collagens were also found to be produced by normal human keratinocytes. These results indicate that the 120-kd polypeptide is a potentially functional protein that may participate in the formation of the extracellular matrix of keratinocytes. 
1	11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione: a marker of adrenal function in hirsutism. To assess the role of the adrenal glands in the development of hirsutism, levels of 11 beta-hydroxyandrostenedione (11 beta-OHA), 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), androstenedione (delta 4A), and free and total testosterone (T) were measured in 63 hirsute females and 30 control patients. Six of the hirsute patients had basal levels of 11 beta-OHA and 17-OHP and responses to adrenocorticotropic hormone that were significantly greater than these values in controls and the other hirsute women. These women were designated as having an adrenal source for their hirsutism. Women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and idiopathic hirsutism had normal values of 11 beta-OHA and 17-OHP. Levels of total and free T, DHEAS and delta 4A were significantly higher than control values in all of the hirsute women. This study demonstrates that 11 beta-OHA can be used as a marker to assess the adrenal contribution to hirsutism. 
5	Obstructive sleep apnea following topical oropharyngeal anesthesia in loud snorers. Previous studies support the presence of an upper airway reflex mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of upper airway patency during sleep. We investigated the possibility that interference with this reflex mechanism contributes to the development of obstructive sleep apnea. Eight otherwise asymptomatic snorers (seven male and one female), age 39 +/- 5.3 yr (mean +/- SEM), underwent overnight sleep studies on three successive nights. An acclimatization night was followed by two study nights randomly assigned to control (C) and oropharyngeal anesthesia (OPA). On the OPA night topical anesthesia was induced using 10% lidocaine spray and 0.25% bupivacaine gargle. A saline placebo was used on night C. All subjects slept well on both study nights (mean sleep duration was 6.2 h on both study nights), and sleep stage distribution was similar on both nights. Obstructive apneas and hypopneas (OAH) rose from 114 +/- 43 during C to 170 +/- 49 during OPA (p less than 0.02). Central apneas and hypopneas (CAH) were unchanged between the two nights (8 +/- 4.9 versus 7 +/- 3). The duration of OAH was similar on both study nights (20 +/- 1.9 s during C versus 20 +/- 1.5 s during OPA). The frequency of movement arousals terminating OAH tended to be higher during OPA (7 +/- 2.9/h) than during C (3 +/- 0.7); P = NS. The frequency of oxyhemoglobin desaturations was also higher during OPA (5 +/- 2.1/h) than during C (3 +/- 1.4), p less than 0.07. 
1	Pseudocyst of the auricle: successful treatment with intracartilaginous trichloroacetic acid and button bolsters. Pseudocyst of the auricle is an asymptomatic, noninflammatory cystic swelling that typically involves the anthelix of the ear and results from an accumulation of fluid within an unlined intracartilaginous cavity. We report a patient with a recurrent pseudocyst of the auricle and describe a new surgical technique for treating this condition by applying 50% trichloroacetic acid to the intracartilaginous cavity and utilizing external button bolsters for compressive therapy. This therapeutic approach is simple to perform in the office, results in permanent resolution of the pseudocyst, preserves the normal architecture of the external ear, and provides excellent postoperative and long-term cosmetic results. 
1	Expression of the MDR1 gene in human gastric and colorectal carcinomas. We measured expression of the MDR1 gene (also known as the PGY1 gene) in the human gastrointestinal tract. MDR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were elevated in 13 of 15 colorectal carcinoma specimens and in six of 13 gastric carcinoma specimens. Well-differentiated colorectal carcinomas contained significantly higher concentrations of MDR1 mRNA than moderately differentiated colorectal carcinomas. Similarly, moderately differentiated gastric carcinomas contained higher concentrations of MDR1 mRNA than poorly differentiated gastric carcinomas. MDR1 gene expression in normal colorectal and gastric tissues adjacent to carcinomas was similar to that in the carcinomas. MDR1 gene expression in xenografts of colorectal and gastric carcinomas in nude mice was also investigated. Elevated expression of the MDR1 gene was seen in only four of 18 xenografts of colorectal carcinoma and was not seen in any xenografts of gastric carcinoma. P-glycoprotein was distributed over the luminal surface of the colorectal carcinoma. These results imply that the higher levels of MDR1 mRNA found in well-differentiated carcinomas derived from colorectal tissues are the results of increased expression of the MDR1 gene in the luminal surface cells. The level of expression of the MDR1 gene in colorectal and gastric carcinomas appears to correlate with the degree of differentiation and also appears to be affected by transplantation into nude mice. 
2	Prognostic factors in alcoholic liver disease. VA Cooperative Study Group. Two hundred eighty-one alcoholic patients were prospectively evaluated by clinical, biochemical, and histologic parameters during a 4-yr period to assess their prognosis. They were stratified into four categories of injury: 1) fatty liver (26 patients), 2) acute alcoholic hepatitis (106), 3) cirrhosis (39), and 4) cirrhosis with superimposed alcoholic hepatitis (111). The rate of survival and variables correlating with survival varied according to the group. At 48 months, 70% of the patients with fatty liver were alive, 58% in the alcoholic hepatitis group, 49% in cirrhosis, and 35% in alcoholic hepatitis superimposed upon cirrhosis. Within group one, deaths were due to causes unrelated to liver disease. In the alcoholic hepatitis group, factors significantly correlating with survival were ascites, alanine amino-transferase levels, grams of alcohol consumed, continuation of alcohol intake, and clinical severity of disease. Survival in patients of group three correlated significantly with prothrombin time and histologic severity score. Patients with combined cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis exhibited the worst prognosis, with the most significant predictors of survival being age, grams of alcohol consumed, the ratio of serum aminotransferases (AST:ALT) and the histologic and clinical severity of the disease. Although a different pattern of correlates was observed for each pathologic level of injury, knowledge of the various correlates aids in prognostic assessment. 
3	Haemostatic changes in the loin pain and haematuria syndrome: secondary to renal vasospasm? Twenty-five patients (seven male, 18 female) were diagnosed as having the loin pain and haematuria syndrome. Presenting symptoms were either loin pain alone or pain associated with macroscopic or microscopic haematuria, and were longstanding, having been present for mean of 9.3 years in males, and 10 years in females. Ten patients described symptoms of passing gravel or renal stones but these were only demonstrated radiologically in two patients. Investigation of all patients showed anatomically normal renal tracts, normal renal function, and no significant proteinuria. Phase-contrast microscopy during episodes of haematuria revealed dysmorphic red cells in all 10 patients studied. Renal biopsies were performed in 20 patients and showed no glomerular pathology, but arteriolar and arterial hyalinosis was seen in 13 of 20 (65 per cent), fibro-elastosis in larger vessels in eight of 20 (40 per cent) and red blood cells in tubules in 13 of 20 (65 per cent) patients. The histological appearance in vessels was similar to that seen in cyclosporin A nephrotoxicity and would be consistent with the hypothesis that regional vasospasm occurs in the cortical circulation. Haematological studies in 22 patients, when compared with age and sex matched controls, showed the presence of circulating platelet aggregates, elevation of plasma beta-thromboglobulin (p less than 0.001), and increased platelet aggregation in response to serotonin and ADP (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.03, respectively). Plasma concentrations of D dimer (p less than 0.02) and C-reactive protein (p less than 0.03) were also significantly elevated in the patient group. There was no deterioration of renal function during a mean observation period of 3.7 years and no patients developed proteinuria. Treatment was largely supportive; seven patients with intractable loin pain underwent surgical denervation with the relief of pain in four. 
5	Isolated erythroid hypoplasia and renal insufficiency induced by long-term griseofulvin therapy. We describe a patient with hematuria, pyuria, eosinophiluria, decreased renal function, and severe anemia that developed while she was receiving chronic therapy with griseofulvin for onychomycosis. We offer evidence that griseofulvin can cause an isolated erythroid hypoplasia and possibly an allergic interstitial nephritis. This is the first documented case of the above entities induced by the agent. We would recommend, based on our report, that otherwise healthy patients, when maintained on the drug for extended periods of time, have periodic determinations of renal function and hematologic status. As drug-induced erythroid hypoplasia typically occurs after a relatively long period of dosing, it may be prudent in certain individuals to monitor the CBC at approximately bimonthly intervals after initiation of therapy. Recommendations regarding monitoring of renal function are more difficult, as acute allergic interstitial nephritis can occur after either short- or long-term exposure to certain drugs. 
4	The mechanism of heart failure caused by cardiac allograft rejection. Rejection of the cardiac allograft is often associated with reversible myocardial failure, the mechanism of which is not understood. We have examined this phenomenon in a small animal model that provides the opportunity for multimodality study of the rejection process. Heterotopic cardiac transplantation was performed in the Lewis rat with Lewis X Brown-Norway (allografts) or Lewis (isografts) donors. Without immunosuppression, allografts are completely rejected in 6 to 8 days. At 3 days cardiac grafts were explanted and mounted on a modified Langendorff apparatus for functional measurements or submitted for pathologic examination and biochemical determination of high-energy phosphates. Three-day isografts (n = 9) had minimal histologic changes. Pathologic examination of 3-day allografts (n = 13) showed lymphocytic infiltrate and myocyte necrosis, histologic features for which antirejection treatment is usually given clinically. For grafts subjected to functional studies (n = 11), heart rate, cardiac output, coronary flow, and stroke work were determined at baseline and in response to isoproterenol (3 x 10(-8) mol/ml). Three-day allografts (n = 6) and isografts (n = 5) had similar baseline function. The chronotropic response to isoproterenol was similar in allografts and isografts, but allografts had diminished cardiac output and stroke work after isoproterenol. Adenosine triphosphate levels were normal (41.9 nmol/mg) in 3-day allografts (n = 4). We have evaluated functional, biochemical, and pathologic changes associated with myocardial dysfunction during heterotopic cardiac transplant rejection in a small animal. This model reproducibly demonstrates diminished contractile reserve in 3-day allografts with normal baseline function and high-energy stores but histologically significant rejection. 
4	Influence of Doppler sample volume location on the assessment of changes in mitral inflow velocity profiles. Previous studies that have validated Doppler indexes of mitral inflow have used pulsed wave sample volume locations either at the level of the mitral valve anulus or at the tips of the mitral valve leaflets. Although significant differences between absolute values for peak velocities and velocity time integrals at these sample volume locations have previously been reported, no information exists that has compared changes in inflow profiles after an intervention to improve left ventricular filling. To address this question, 13 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 50 +/- 13 mm Hg) caused by chronic thromboembolic disease were studied with use of Doppler echocardiography immediately before and after surgical reduction of pulmonary hypertension (pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from 916 +/- 413 to 233 +/- 89 dynes.sec.cm5). This clinical model has been shown to have abnormal mitral inflow velocity profiles that improve markedly after surgery. Doppler measures of early and late peak velocities were significantly lower both before and after surgery when sampling at the mitral anulus compared with the leaflet tips, although late filling parameters and the deceleration of early flow velocity tended to differ little. With surgery, the significant increase in peak early velocity and the ratio of early to late velocity was present regardless of the sample volume location (peak E at leaflet tips, 47.1 +/- 16.0 to 68.9 +/- 15.4 [p less than 0.001], and at anulus, 40.7 +/- 11.3 to 56.2 +/- 14.6 cm/sec [p less than 0.001]; peak E/A at leaflet tips, 0.95 +/- 0.4 to 1.55 +/- 0.9, and at anulus, 0.78 +/- 0.3 to 1.32 +/- 0.7 [both p less than 0.02]). 
5	Oral labetalol in hypertensive urgencies. The response to incremental doses of oral labetalol in 16 patients with hypertensive urgencies is presented. After inadequate blood pressure control with 20 mg of intravenous furosemide, each patient received a 300 mg oral dose of labetalol. Subsequent oral doses of labetalol, 100 mg, were administered at 2-hour intervals, if the diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 100 mm Hg. The maximum dose of labetalol per patient was 500 mg. Five patients required only the initial 300 mg dose of labetalol. Two patients required further therapy for satisfactory blood pressure control. Mean arterial pressure fell from 156 +/- 12 mm Hg to 123 +/- 14 mm Hg. 
1	Bcr/abl recombinant DNA analysis versus karyotype in the diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of chronic myeloid leukemia. Karyotype and bcr/abl recombinant DNA analyses are two means of detecting the chromosomal aberration in chronic myeloid leukemia. The authors compared these two methods in a retrospective study of 36 patients with CML in which they found the bcr/abl DNA recombinant event in 100% (29 of 29) of those patients who had the Philadelphia chromosome. To achieve this sensitivity, a battery of two bcr probes and three restriction enzymes is necessary. The authors propose a sequential algorithm for efficient use of these probes and enzymes. In 76% of the patients, bcr/abl rearrangement can be detected with a Bgl II digest and a 3' commercial probe. An additional 21% of patients can be detected by a second assay in which the same membrane is rehybridized to a 3' and 5' combination bcr probe. One patient (3%) required an additional restriction enzyme digest with BamH I to detect the recombinant event by the same 3' probe. Karyotype analysis is used to determine cytogenetic remission in patients with CML under therapy. The authors studied the use of DNA analysis by the Southern blot technique to detect a decrease in the relative number of leukemic cells. By dilution studies and densitometric scanning of autoradiographs, the authors were able to detect a 15% decrease in the relative number of cells having the bcr/abl recombinant event. The authors report the preliminary results of three patients in whom they compared the karyotype and recombinant DNA analysis at multiple time points in their clinical course. In conclusion, the bcr/abl recombinant DNA analysis is superior to karyotype for the diagnosis of CML and can be used for monitoring treated patients. 
1	Forces of change in the health care system. Implications for cancer care in the 1990s. Dramatic changes will occur in the health care system during the 1990s which will profoundly affect the delivery of care for cancer. Perhaps the most important factor is the aging of the population. As the proportion of people who achieve old age increases, the absolute prevalence and incidence of cancer will increase despite improved treatment techniques. This phenomenon will increase health care expenditures despite ongoing efforts to control costs. Second, there will be continuing efforts at cost control and increased emphasis on quality assurance and outcomes by third party payers. Providers will be scrutinized and compared with one another. The large payers of the nation's health care bills will demand proof of outcome and cost leading to bidding by providers and payment only to those who have the best outcome for the least money. Third, there will be an increasing emphasis on prevention and screening, in public health policy, an approach that may conflict with personal freedom. Fourth, there will be increasing deliberations and questions about the ethics of the health care system and treatment decisions. There will be continuing debate about the need for a rationing of health care and the right of individual privacy versus the states' right to preserve life. These changes will impact on all health care professionals whose practice includes patients with cancer. 
2	Pancreatic ascites: treatment by continuous somatostatin infusion. Two male patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse were admitted with pancreatic ascites (high concentration of amylase, raised protein concentration, no specific cytologic features). Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) confirmed gross ascites and inflammation of the pancreas in both patients, and a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas in one of them. Treatment with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and a H2-blocking agent was instituted and continued for 4 and 2 wk, respectively. Due to lack of improvement, somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h) was started. During the next few days, there was a rapid improvement of the clinical status, and the production of ascites ceased. We conclude that somatostatin infusion should be tried before any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in patients with pancreatic ascites. 
3	Partial cytochrome b deficiency and generalized dystonia. An 18-year-old female had clinical features of idiopathic torsion dystonia with bilateral hypodense putaminal lesions on computed tomography. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy was suspected because of persistent lactic acidemia and myopathy. Studies of oxidative metabolism on isolated skeletal muscle mitochondria revealed partial cytochrome b deficiency indicating a defect in the cytochrome b- c1 complex. This finding represents a unique, multisystem syndrome of progressive dystonia, putaminal degeneration, myopathy, and mitochondrial cytochrome b deficiency. Mitochondrial metabolic disorders may be a cause of torsion dystonia when other known associated factors are absent. 
1	Carboplatin in childhood brain tumors. A Children's Cancer Study Group Phase II trial. Between October 1985 and March 1988, Children's Cancer Study Group institutions entered 95 patients with recurrent brain tumors into a Phase II trial of carboplatin 560 mg/m2 every 4 weeks. Complete or partial responses were observed for one of 19 evaluable children with brainstem glioma, two of 14 with ependymoma, six of 19 with medulloblastoma or central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), and none of 15 with high-grade astrocytoma. Of 33 children with medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or central nervous system PNET, five of 12 with no prior cisplatin exposure had responses, and two of 21 with prior cisplatin exposure had responses (P = 0.03). Thirty-four percent of patients had absolute neutrophil count nadirs less than 500/microliters, and 37% had platelet count nadirs less than 25,000/microliters. Sixteen percent had moderate to severe otoxicity, 10% had nausea and vomiting, and none had nephrotoxicity. 
5	Efficacy of induction therapy in cadaveric renal transplantation comparing rabbit antithymocyte serum and Minnesota antilymphoblast globulin. From August 1986 to July 1989, 98 patients receiving primary cadaveric kidney transplants received either RATS (n = 50) or MALG (n = 48) during the induction phase of a quadruple immunosuppressive protocol. Patient groups were well matched. The duration of RATS and MALG treatment and the time of CyA induction were equivalent. Serum creatinine and rejection episodes up to 1 year were not statistically different. Hematologic side effects resulted in dose reduction of MALG in 42% of patients without adverse rejection results. In the RATS group, no dosage reductions were required. One-year patient survivals (96% to 100%), and 1-year graft survival (82% to 85%) were not significantly different in the 2 groups. Infectious complications were 30% higher in the MALG group and a significant factor in 2 deaths. Monitoring of lymphocyte subsets revealed insignificant differences in the percent of decrease of each cell population between MALG and RATS groups during induction. 
1	Prognostic factors and value of adjunctive nephrectomy in patients with stage IV renal cell carcinoma. We reviewed 57 cases of Stage IV renal cell carcinoma to clarify the factors influencing prognosis and to evaluate the value of nephrectomy. Cumulative survival from the initial diagnosis was analyzed with respect to the patients' age, sex, side of primary tumor, initial performance status (PS), site of metastasis, and nephrectomy. Overall survival for the patients was 51 percent at one year, 22 percent at three years, and 11 percent at five years. Age, sex, and side of primary tumor had no influence on survival. Improved survival was correlated with good PS, metastases limited to single organ, and removal of the primary tumor. With regard to histopathologic features in nephrectomized patients, low grade and stage were correlated with longer survival. These factors should be considered in the analysis of results of future clinical trials of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. 
1	Natural history of cardiac rhabdomyoma in infancy and childhood. Although spontaneous regression of cardiac rhabdomyoma has been reported, prognosis is still considered to be poor and surgery continues to be indicated. The experience with rhabdomyoma diagnosed in live infants over a 20-year period was reviewed. Diagnosis by angiography or echocardiography was accepted only if multiple tumors were present or if tuberous sclerosis was also diagnosed. Nine patients (3 diagnosed prenatally and the remaining 6 at age less than 8 months) were identified as having a total of 24 tumors. Measurements in 2 planes demonstrated at least some evidence of regression in 24 patients (100%), with 20 of 24 having complete resolution. One patient required delayed surgery for excision of a subaortic ridge that appeared at the site of a resolved tumor. Our findings suggest that pediatric cardiac rhabdomyoma is most often a benign condition in which spontaneous regression is the rule. Surgery is recommended only for patients with refractory dysrhythmias or severe hemodynamic compromise. 
4	Regurgitant jet size by transesophageal compared with transthoracic Doppler color flow imaging. Combined echocardiography and Doppler color flow mapping from transthoracic imaging windows has become the standard method for the noninvasive assessment of valvular regurgitation. This study compared regurgitant jet areas by Doppler color flow imaging derived from the newer transesophageal approach with measurements obtained from conventional transthoracic apical views. Maximal regurgitant jet area determinations and an overall visual estimate of lesion severity were obtained from 42 patients who underwent color flow examination by both techniques. Seventy-three regurgitant lesions were visualized by transesophageal flow imaging: 34 mitral, 22 aortic, and 17 tricuspid jets. Transthoracic studies in the same patients revealed fewer regurgitant lesions for each valve; 20 mitral, 16 aortic, and 12 tricuspid (p = 0.0009). A comparison of maximal jet areas determined by transesophageal and transthoracic studies showed a good overall correlation (r = 0.85, SEE = 2.8 cm2) and a systematic overestimation by the transesophageal technique (TEE = 0.96 TTX + 2.7). For the subgroup with mitral insufficiency, valve lesions visualized by both techniques were larger by the transesophageal approach (n = 18, 6.0 versus 3.6 cm2, p = 0.008). Semiquantitative visual grading of individual valve lesions by two independent observers revealed a higher grade of regurgitation with more jets classified as mild (38 versus 25), moderate (18 versus 13), and severe (17 versus 10) by esophageal imaging than by transthoracic imaging. Thus, transesophageal color flow mapping techniques yield a higher prevalence of valvular regurgitation than do transthoracic techniques in the same patients. Jet area and the overall estimate of regurgitant lesion severity were also greater by transesophageal color Doppler imaging compared with standard transthoracic imaging. 
4	Oral contraceptive therapy and the surgical management of ENT patients: a review of current clinical practice. The current policy of British Otolaryngologists with regard to the preoperative cessation of the oral contraceptive pill is reported. This is based on a confidential questionnaire sent to all members of the British Association of Otolaryngologists. The overall response rate was 66%, 91% of which were from practising otolaryngologists and forms the basis of this report, the remaining 9% being from respondents not engaged in active surgery. Although there is evidence to show an increased risk of developing thromboembolic complications after major abdominal, gynaecological and hip surgery in those patients taking the oestrogen-containing contraceptive pill, the risk following minor and intermediate surgery (which forms the bulk of the otolaryngologist's workload) is not known. Not surprisingly therefore the results of the survey show a varied policy across the country with 36.5% of respondents choosing to continue the pill and 25% always stopping the pill preoperatively. The remainder elect to stop the pill only in certain circumstances. 
1	The relationship of Papanicolaou testing and contacts with the medical care system to stage at diagnosis of cervical cancer. The relationship of Papanicolaou (Pap) testing and physician visits to stage at diagnosis of cervical cancer was assessed by interviews with 149 women with invasive cervical cancer and 214 women with in situ cervical cancer. A significantly smaller percent of study subjects with invasive disease than in situ disease had at least one Pap test in the 3 years prior to diagnosis (age- and race-adjusted odds ratio: 3.38). The two groups did not differ in visits to a physician for other reasons during this period. Pap testing decreased with increasing age for both groups, but not physician visits. While 65% percent of the subjects with invasive disease aged between 65 and 79 years had never had a Pap test until diagnosis, 88% had seen a physician in the preceding 3 years. Women with regional or distant invasive disease were least likely to have had Pap tests, and, within this group, those aged between 35 and 64 years were also least likely to have seen a physician. Strategies for early detection must reflect missed opportunities and the need to bring those not receiving care into the system. 
2	The hazards of surgical glove dusting powders. Surgical contaminants of many kinds, including glove powder, constitute a source of formation of granulomas. This is particularly well-documented in the peritoneal cavity ("starch peritonitis"), but has been documented in most anatomic sites. The production of starch-free gloves should remove this hazard, but the surgeon should remain aware that most particulate substances introduced into the body inevitably set up an inflammatory response. 
3	Diurnal fluctuations of arterial ketone body ratio in normal subjects and patients with liver dysfunction. To explore the metabolic aspects of chronic liver disease, diurnal changes of arterial ketone body ratio (acetoacetate/3-hydroxybutyrate), reflecting hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, were investigated in normal subjects, patients with chronic liver disease (Child's class A or B), and patients with hepatic failure (Child's class C). Ketone body ratio in normal subjects increased after breakfast from 0.96 to 2.00, after lunch from 2.17 to 2.38, and after dinner from 1.23 to 2.55 with blood glucose level ranging from 103 to 141 mg/dL (5.7 to 7.8 mmol/L). By contrast, the ketone body ratio in the Child A or B group changed little and remained within a range of 0.70-1.35 despite a large change in blood glucose level from 102 to 176 mg/dL (5.7 to 9.8 mmol/L). Ketone body ratio in Child's class C remained near or below 0.4 with no response to glucose administration, despite a marked elevation in blood glucose level. These results indicate that hepatic mitochondrial redox potential undergoes diurnal changes in sharp response to meals in normal liver function but that these fluctuations are absent in patients with liver damage (Child's class A, B, and C). Furthermore, it remains at low levels in severe liver failure (Child's class C). It is also suggested that hepatic mitochondrial redox potential plays an important role in the regulation of blood glucose levels. 
1	Immunohistologic detection of the epidermal growth factor receptor in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) expression was studied immunohistologically in 38 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The EGF-R was faintly expressed in basal and parabasal layers of normal esophageal epithelia and in cancer nests of 20 patients; it was strongly expressed in all areas of dysplastic epithelia and in cancer nests of 18 patients. The patients with strongly expressed EGF-R had lymph node metastases more frequently, and their prognosis was poorer than those with faintly expressed EGF-R. The EGF-R expression showed a mosaic pattern in 17 patients and a diffuse pattern in 21 patients. The patients with a mosaic pattern had lymph node metastases more frequently and a worse prognosis than those with a diffuse pattern. Expression of EGF-R in metastatic lymph nodes was similar to that in strongly expressing areas of primary cancers with a mosaic pattern. Thus EGF-R expression may be an important indicator for malignancies of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas because primary cancer cells with strongly expressed EGF-R metastasize to lymph nodes more frequently. 
5	An effective treatment protocol for intraarterial drug injection. Between 1972 and 1988, 48 patients with extremity ischemia after an intraarterial drug injection were treated with the following protocol: heparin, dextran 40, dexamethasone, elevation, and early mobilization of the extremity. A tissue ischemia score, derived by assessing the color, capillary refill, sensory function, and temperature of the extremity, was used to assess the ischemic injury. Each sign was scored either normal = 0 or abnormal = 1; then summed to provide the tissue ischemia score (range, 0 to 4). Twenty-four (50%) patients had an extremity tissue ischemia score less than or equal to 2. After treatment 22 of the 24 patients had a normal extremity, and 2 required limited digital amputations. In this group, outcome was comparable regardless of the time interval from intraarterial drug injection to treatment. Ten of 24 (50%) patients with an extremity tissue ischemia score greater than 2 had a normal extremity, 3 had a functional deficit, and 11 required digital amputations. Twelve of the 24 patients were treated within 24 hours and had a significantly superior outcome when compared to the 12 who were treated more than 24 hours after intraarterial drug injection (p less than 0.001, Fisher's exact test). The tissue ischemia score is a useful predictor of extremity outcome in patients with intraarterial drug injection. The outlined treatment protocol is effective in minimizing tissue injury caused by intraarterial drug injection. Institution of treatment within 24 hours of intraarterial drug injection is particularly important in patients who manifest severe ischemia. 
4	Renal vascular disease in African-Americans and other racial minorities. Hypertensive end-stage renal disease is about 10-fold more common nationwide in African-Americans than in Caucasians and 17-fold higher in some sections of the United States. These figures are alarming and require a much greater effort in understanding the causes of this disparity and improving blood pressure control in this population to prevent catastrophic renal damage. More information is also needed about the renovascular status of other minorities. Financial obstacles to antihypertensive care appear to be an important contributing factor to the disparities of end-stage renal disease in African-Americans and perhaps other minorities. 
5	Species-dependent effects of adenosine on heart rate and atrioventricular nodal conduction. Mechanism and physiological implications. This study 1) compares the negative chronotropic and dromotropic actions of adenosine in guinea pig, rat, and rabbit hearts; 2) investigates the mechanism(s) for the different responses; and 3) determines the physiological implications. Isolated perfused hearts were instrumented for measurement of atrial rate and atrioventricular (AV) nodal conduction time. Differences in metabolism of adenosine were determined in the absence and presence of dipyridamole (nucleoside uptake blocker) and erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA, adenosine deaminase inhibitor). Dipyridamole plus EHNA decreased adenosine's EC50 for the negative dromotropic effect by 14-fold in guinea pig heart and 1.6-fold in rat heart. This is consistent with the greater number of [3H]nitrobenzylthioinosine binding sites measured in membranes from guinea pig (1,231 +/- 68 fmol/mg protein) compared with rat (302 +/- 31 fmol/mg protein) and rabbit (260 +/- 28 fmol/mg protein) atria. The potency of adenosine to slow atrial rate and prolong AV nodal conduction time was greater in guinea pig than in rat or rabbit hearts. This rank order of potency correlated well with the number of binding sites for the specific adenosine receptor radioligand 125I-aminobenzyladenosine in guinea pig (102 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein), rat (11 +/- 0.5 fmol/mg protein), and rabbit (8 +/- 1 fmol/mg protein) atrial membranes. Hypoxia increased the rate of adenosine release by severalfold and caused slowing of heart rate and AV block. In spontaneously beating hearts, the main effect of hypoxia was a slowing of ventricular rate, which in the guinea pig heart was due to AV block and in the rat heart to atrial slowing. In atrial paced hearts, hypoxia caused a marked prolongation of AV nodal conduction time in guinea pig (39 +/- 4 msec) and rabbit (29 +/- 5 msec) hearts, but only small effect in rat hearts (10 +/- 2 msec). The differences in response to hypoxia could be accounted for by the species-dependent differences in the 1) amount of adenosine released and metabolized, 2) sensitivity of the hearts to adenosine, and 3) dependency of AV nodal conduction on atrial rate. The findings indicate that the results from physiological or pharmacological studies on adenosine in one species may not be applicable to others, and the ultimate effect of adenosine and hypoxia is to slow ventricular rate. 
5	Daytime reduction of gastro-oesophageal reflux after healing of oesophagitis and its value as an indicator of favourable response to maintenance treatment. In order to investigate the response of gastro-oesophageal reflux after medically induced healing of oesophagitis and its relation to the occurrence of relapse during prophylactic treatment, 20 patients with erosive/ulcerative oesophagitis underwent 24 hour oesophageal pH monitoring before and after healing achieved with 12 to 24 week treatment with ranitidine 150 or 300 mg twice daily. Compared with pretreatment values, after macroscopic healing, a significant reduction in daytime median percentage of reflux time (10.0 v 6.5; p less than 0.05) and median number of reflux episodes lasting more than 5 minutes (5-5 v 1.0; p less than 0.05) were observed, whereas during night time reflux frequency and severity did not change. During maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 or 300 mg nocte, five of the six patients, who had shown no improvement in gastro-oesophageal reflux after acute healing, relapsed. These results suggest that, in contrast with previous work, a decrease in gastro-oesophageal reflux in patients with reflux oesophagitis can be achieved after macroscopic healing, and that the occurrence of such a reduction after acute healing is predictive of a good response to longterm treatment. 
4	Revascularization of an ischemic limb by use of a muscle pedicle flap: a rabbit model. A rabbit model of hind limb ischemia was designed to demonstrate that new, hemodynamically significant arterial connections will develop between ischemic skeletal muscle and an independently perfused muscle pedicle flap. The right common iliac artery was divided in 15 rabbits. In eight rabbits a muscle flap based on the left deep inferior epigastric artery was transposed to the right thigh (flap group). In seven rabbits a sham operation was performed where the flap was sutured to the abdominal wall (sham group). After 7 days angiography demonstrated arterial connections between the flap and the native limb circulation in all of the flap group animals. The flap increased muscle perfusion in the ischemic limb (2.99 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the flap group, vs 2.06 ml/100 gm muscle/minute in the sham group, p less than 0.005). Hemodynamically significant vascular connections will develop between a well-perfused muscle flap and an ischemic limb. The augmentation in perfusion provided by these connections can be quantified. 
3	Nonfearful panic disorder in neurology patients validated by lactate challenge. OBJECTIVE: Nonfearful panic disorder meets the DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder but is not associated with subjective fear and anxiety. The authors determined its prevalence in a group of neurology patients and assessed its diagnostic validity as a panic disorder subtype by evaluating the response of the patients with nonfearful panic disorder to sodium lactate and antipanic pharmacotherapy. METHOD: The subjects were all neurology patients referred over 1 year to a university hospital's psychiatric consultation service because of negative medical workups for their symptoms (N = 48). Patients who met the DSM-III-R criteria for panic disorder but did not report subjective anxiety or fear during panic episodes were diagnosed as having nonfearful panic disorder. Afterward, each of those patients received a sodium lactate infusion and, 5 hours later, a sodium chloride infusion. They were then treated with antipanic medication and followed for at least 6 months. RESULTS: Of the 48 neurology patients referred for psychiatric evaluation, 11 (23%) met the criteria for panic disorder, and all 11 met the criteria for nonfearful panic disorder. All 11 responded positively to lactate but not to placebo, and they each experienced an at least 75% reduction in symptoms during the 6-month follow-up period. Detailed case reports of three of these patients are presented. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the construct and predictive diagnostic validity of nonfearful panic disorder as a subtype of panic disorder and suggest that a lack of attention to this group leads to both the underestimation of the prevalence of panic disorder and to the withholding of potentially successful treatments for this group. 
1	Effects of site-directed mutagenesis at residues cysteine-31 and cysteine-184 on lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase activity. Native lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT; phosphatidylcholine-sterol acyltransferase; phosphatidylcholine:sterol O-acyltransferase, EC 2.3.1.43) protein, and LCAT in which either or both of the enzyme free cysteines had been replaced with glycine residues by site-directed mutagenesis, has been expressed in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human LCAT gene. The mass of LCAT secreted, determined by immunoassay, did not differ in the native and mutant species. LCAT specific activity was also unchanged in the mutant species. In particular, the cysteine-free double mutant, in which Cys-31 and Cys-184 had both been replaced, was fully active in the synthesis of cholesteryl esters. This result is not consistent with a catalytic role for LCAT free cysteine residues. The classical inhibitor of LCAT activity, 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB), which strongly (89%) inhibited the native enzyme, had partial (45%) inhibitory activity with mutant enzyme species containing a single -SH residue, while the double mutant was not significantly inhibited by DTNB. These data are interpreted to suggest that Cys-31 and Cys-184 are vicinal both to each other and to the "interfacial binding site" at residues 177-182, and that DTNB exerts its effect by steric inhibition. 
4	A novel mechanical cardiac assist device for reversing left ventricular failure. Diastolic augmentation of aortic pressure is an efficacious means of improving coronary perfusion in heart failure. A novel mechanical cardiac assist device (MCAD), that has advantages over a conventional intraaortic balloon pump and left ventricular assist devices, has been developed. It consists of a high efficiency rotary solenoid, coupled to a pair of actuator plates that clamp on a shunt aortic graft section, and operates in a diastolic counterpulsation mode. The system has been evaluated in six anesthetized, thoracotomized dogs with myocardial ischemia. The MCAD was activated 30-40 min after coronary artery occlusion and synchronized with the R-wave. As illustrated by a representative sample of the data obtained from one of several trials, the preliminary experimental results demonstrated that the MCAD worked effectively to fulfill the primary functions of a counterpulsation assist device, i.e., augmentation of coronary perfusion and reduction in the vascular impedance to ventricular ejection. 
5	Scintigraphic assessment of leukocyte infiltration in acute pancreatitis using technetium-99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine as leukocyte label. The infiltration of leukocytes has been linked to the pathophysiology of complicated or severe pancreatitis. We have tested the ability of leukocyte scintigraphy using technetium-99m-hexamethyl propylene amine oxine (HM-PAO) as label to demonstrate the localization of leukocytes in the pancreas during acute pancreatitis. Twenty-eight patients with acute pancreatitis (eight with biliary, 13 with alcoholic, and seven with unknown origin) were studied with leukocyte scintigraphy using planar imaging and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Fourteen patients had a mild (group I), II a severe (group II), and three a lethal outcome (group III) of pancreatitis. All patients of group III, six of group II, and two of group I had a positive leukocyte scan. Thus, the sensitivity of leukocyte scintigraphy for the detection of a lethal course of acute pancreatitis was 100%, of a severe course 54%, and of a severe or lethal course 64%. The specificity of a negative scan for a mild pancreatitis was 86%. Comparison of the results of leukocyte scintigraphy with those of contrast enhanced CT showed that six of eight patients with pancreatic necrosis in CT had a positive leukocyte scan, but only five of 20 patients without detectable pancreatic necrosis in CT. In summary, leukocyte infiltration into the pancreas during pancreatitis can be demonstrated by noninvasive leukocyte scintigraphy using technetium-99m-HM-PAO as label. A correlation between the severity of the disease and leukocyte infiltration exists. 
3	Clinical dysautonomia in patients with bronchial asthma. Study with seven autonomic function tests. Fifty asthmatic patients and 20 healthy control subjects, carefully age- and sex-matched, were subjected to seven standardized tests to evaluate their autonomic status. Due care was taken to remove factors which could interfere with results. Of the tests concerned with the parasympathetic system, the intravenous atropine test (p greater than 0.10) and heart rate response to standing (p greater than 0.01) which measured the basal parasympathetic tone, did not show a significant difference. Tests requiring stimulation of the parasympathetic system, ie, deep breathing test (p less than 0.001), Valsalva maneuver (p less than 0.001), and carotid sinus massage (p less than 0.001) showed significantly heightened response. Postural fall of blood pressure (p greater than 0.10) and sustained hand grip test (p greater than 0.10), chiefly concerned with the sympathetic system, did not show a significant difference. Of the 50 asthmatic patients, nine were atopic and 41 nonatopic. When the results were compared in the two groups separately, we found that there was no alteration in the measurements except the intravenous atropine test which showed heightened response with atopic subjects (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that hyperresponsiveness of the parasympathetic system is an important factor in producing bronchial spasm in asthmatic patients, and atopic and nonatopic subjects do not differ much in their autonomic status. 
4	Cardiovascular risk factor clustering and ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in angiographically documented coronary artery disease. High levels of cardiac risk factors tend to cluster together and act synergistically. To develop a suitable and practical marker for clustering, we evaluated 380 consecutive patients at the time of coronary angiography. Analyses of lipid, rheologic, clinical and arteriographic profiles indicated a variety of interwoven relations. Because the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (total/HDL cholesterol) was closely related to both the presence and extent of greater than or equal to 50% diameter reduction of greater than or equal to 1 coronary arteries, it was used to divide patients into quartiles. Clustering of high- and low-level risk factors was demonstrated in the highest and lowest quartiles of total/HDL cholesterol, respectively (p less than 0.001). The highest quartile may be characterized by an only moderately elevated total cholesterol level but patients in this quartile may have a very low HDL cholesterol level, high triglycerides, a tendency toward high hemoglobin and fibrinogen levels, a history of smoking, previous myocardial infarction and multivessel disease. These results suggest that total/HDL cholesterol serves as a marker not only for obstructive coronary disease but also for a cluster of potentially modifiable risk factors. 
1	Distribution of immunoglobulins and secretory component in gastric cancer of the aged. The secretory immune system plays an important role in the local humoral immunity of the gastrointestinal tract. In order to evaluate humoral immunity in gastric cancer, distribution of immunoglobulins (Ig) and secretory component was immunohistochemically studied in 74 early and 15 advanced primary gastric cancers. In non-cancerous gastric mucosa, IgA and IgM, and secretory component were mainly identified in the cytoplasm of the intestinal metaplasia. In early gastric cancer of well-differentiated type, the localization of IgA and IgM, and secretory component was similar to that of intestinal metaplasia. In advanced gastric cancer, they were faintly observed and showed low positivity. The number of Ig-containing cells infiltrating cancerous stroma was enumerated. Immunoglobulin A-containing cells were dominant in the stroma of early gastric cancer. On the other hand, there were few Ig-containing cells in the stroma of advanced gastric cancer, and the number of IgA-containing and IgM-containing cells was also decreased. These results suggest that local humoral immunity is suppressed in gastric cancer, especially in advanced gastric cancer. 
5	Decalcification of a choroidal osteoma. A 56-year-old man presented with a clearly defined orange tumour in the posterior pole of his left eye. A choroidal osteoma was suspected, and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated subretinal neovascularisation on the nasal edge of the tumour, which was treated with krypton laser photocoagulation twice. Recurrent subretinal neovascularisation occurred one year later and was not amenable to treatment. Three years after the patient first presented, thinning of the tumour was noted on follow-up examination. During the next 15 months the tumour completely disappeared, leaving an area of retinal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy. Total decalcification of the choroidal osteoma was demonstrated by ultrasonography. 
4	Hemodynamic basis of stasis ulceration--a hypothesis. Approximately 25% of patients with stasis ulceration have normal or below normal ambulatory venous pressures. A reflux index was calculated by multiplying postexercise pressures by Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure elevation. In patients with stasis ulceration, reflux index was found to have an excellent negative predictive value with a clear discriminant line between normal limbs and those with ulcers. Increasing incidence of stasis ulceration was demonstrated with increasing reflux index value. Even when ambulatory venous pressure was within the normal range, the index was found to be abnormal in ulcerated limbs because Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure was elevated in these limbs. Conversely, some patients with stasis ulceration and normal Valsalva foot venous pressure elevation were found to have abnormal ambulatory venous pressure values, yielding an elevated reflux index. Preliminary analysis indicates that reflux index may be a better predictor of surgical outcome after valve reconstruction procedures than either ambulatory venous pressure or Valsalva-induced foot venous pressure elevation. The concept of reflux index is a hypothesis that attempts to explain inconsistencies observed in implicating ambulatory venous hypertension as the sole determinant of venous reflux. 
4	Automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation without thoracotomy using an endocardial and submuscular patch system. The automatic cardioverter-defibrillator lead system is implanted by a thoracotomy procedure that may result in atelectasis, pleural effusion, cardiac tamponade and lengthy convalescence. A new defibrillator lead system that allows selection of different defibrillating current pathways is implanted without a thoracotomy. Ten patients requiring a cardioverter-defibrillator for recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (five patients) or aborted sudden cardiac death (five patients) were evaluated for implantation of this lead system. A lead configuration with a bidirectional defibrillating current pathway was implanted in nine patients. The defibrillation threshold with this lead configuration was 15 J in five patients, 20 J in three and 30 to 35 J in one patient. In the remaining patient the lead system had a 40 J defibrillation threshold and was not implanted. No perioperative complications occurred. Induced ventricular fibrillation was successfully terminated at the predischarge and intermediate follow-up (8 to 12 weeks) electrophysiologic studies. During the follow-up period, there were three deaths (one sudden, two due to heart failure) and two lead system failures (oversensing with inappropriate shocks in one patient and patch lead fracture in another). Implantation of the cardioverter-defibrillator lead system by a nonthoracotomy approach is feasible, has no significant perioperative complications and is well tolerated by patients. Effective defibrillation was demonstrated immediately as well as at intermediate follow-up study. The occurrence of patch lead fracture and oversensing requires improvement in the present (nonthoracotomy) lead system technology. 
3	Physiologic and psychobehavioral research in oncology. A major thrust in research in psychosocial oncology is the study of the interaction of psychologic and physiologic variables. This discussion reviews the current status and future directions of such research. Areas addressed include pain, nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy, sexuality, effects of cancer on psychologic and neuropsychologic function, impact of psychologic factors on cancer and its treatment, and psychoneuroimmunology. In addition, specific recommendations for strategies to facilitate research in these areas of psychosocial oncology are proposed. 
5	Syncope of unknown origin: clinical, noninvasive, and electrophysiologic determinants of arrhythmia induction and symptom recurrence during long-term follow-up. Ninety-one consecutive patients with syncope of unknown origin underwent electrophysiologic studies (EPS). Univariate analysis identified the following variables: age, + signal-averaged ECG (SAECG), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and history of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) on Holter; multivariate analysis identified +SAECG, LVEF, and history of SMVT as risk factors for induction of SMVT at EPS. All patients were followed up for 19.0 +/- 8.3 months and 17 had recurrence of syncope. Patients were divided into empiric, EP-guided, and no therapy groups. The EP-guided therapy group included all patients with SMVT at EPS. Recurrence rates among all three groups were similar. We conclude that: (1) Patients who have inducible SMVT at EPS can be identified using certain clinical and noninvasive variables. When these patients undergo EP-guided therapy, their rate of recurrence of syncope becomes compatible with that of patients who had no arrhythmia induced at EPS. (2) Empiric therapy does not offer any benefit over no therapy in reducing the rate of recurrent of scope. 
4	Radiation-associated valvular disease. The prevalence of radiation-associated cardiac disease is increasing due to prolonged survival following mediastinal irradiation. Side effects of radiation include pericarditis, accelerated coronary artery disease, myocardial fibrosis and valvular injury. We evaluated the cases of three young patients with evidence of significant valvular disease following mediastinal irradiation. One patient underwent the first reported successful aortic and mitral valve replacement for radiation-associated valvular disease (RAVD) as well as concurrent coronary artery revascularization. A review of the literature revealed 35 reported cases of RAVD, with only one successful case of valve replacement that was limited to the aortic valve. Asymptomatic RAVD is diagnosed 11.5 years after mediastinal irradiation compared with 16.5 years for symptomatic patients, emphasizing that long-term follow-up is important for patients receiving mediastinal irradiation. This study defines a continuum of valvular disease following radiation that begins with mild asymptomatic valvular thickening and progresses to severe valvular fibrosis with hemodynamic compromise requiring surgical intervention. 
3	Immunological differentiation between neuroborreliosis and multiple sclerosis. Neuroborreliosis, a tick-borne spirochaetosis of the central nervous system, is diagnosed by the presence of intrathecally synthesized Borrelia burgdorferi-specific antibodies. Multiple sclerosis and neuroborreliosis can show similarities in clinical symptoms as well as lymphocytic cell reactions and oligoclonal bands in the isoelectric focusing of cerebrospinal fluid. To differentiate between multiple sclerosis and neuroborreliosis we tested intrathecally synthesized IgM and virus antibodies. The IgM indices were higher for most of the neuroborreliosis patients studied than for those with multiple sclerosis, and cell counts were also significantly higher in the acute stage of the disease. In 84% of multiple sclerosis patients we were able to demonstrate intrathecal antibody production against measles, rubella or mumps virus. Neuroborreliosis patients had no intrathecal virus antibody synthesis. The specification of oligoclonal bands resulting from isoelectric focusing of cerebrospinal fluid with an ELISA for B. burgdorferi can further substantiate the diagnosis of neuroborreliosis or help to rule it out in multiple sclerosis patients with positive borrelia-specific serology. 
2	Colonoscopy in critically ill patients. What conditions call for it? Indications for colonoscopy in the intensive care unit include acute lower intestinal bleeding, sigmoid volvulus, pseudo-obstruction of the colon, and suspicion of pseudomembranous colitis. Although the incidence of cardiorespiratory complications may be higher in these critically ill patients, the procedure can be done safely with proper attention to detail. Because of colonic dilatation, endoscopy can often be done without bowel preparation. 
4	Evaluation of metastatic cardiac calcification in a model of chronic primary hyperparathyroidism. Recent reports have fueled an interest in the prevalence and significance of metastatic calcium deposition in patients with chronic hyperparathyroidism. Experimental data are limited by the lack of suitable in vivo animal models. We have developed a model of marked hypercalcemia and overproduction of parathyroid hormone using somatic gene transfer. Briefly, the process involves infection of cultured rodent fibroblasts (RAT-1 cells) with a retroviral expression vector that contains the gene encoding human parathyroid hormone. Fibroblasts are grown to confluence on collagen-coated dextran microcarrier beads and are injected into the peritoneal cavities of syngeneic Fisher rats. Human parathyroid hormone production in rat serum is quantified by an immunoradiometric assay for human parathyroid hormone (1-84), which does not recognize rat parathyroid hormone. These rats consistently show production of human hormone within a week. Levels increase progressively, often to 1 ng/ml within 60 days of injection. Serum calcium showed a concomitant rise to an average of 15.5 mg/dl. In this study, 13 rats that had been transplanted with parathyroid hormone-producing fibroblasts were killed 80 days after injection. Examination of the skeleton revealed demineralization and histopathologic sequelae of parathyroid hormone excess with extensive osteoclastic bone resorption. Examination of the hearts revealed calcification in five of 13 hearts. There was no involvement of major coronary arteries or conducting systems, but there was calcification of cardiac myocytes, primarily in subepicardial region. This model may permit an understanding of the mechanisms for sudden cardiac death in severe hypercalcemia. 
5	Hemodynamic effects of ketamine, hypoxia and hyperoxia in children with surgically treated congenital heart disease residing greater than or equal to 1,200 meters above sea level. Little data are available on the hemodynamic effects of premedications and anesthetic agents on infants and children. Ketamine is the most frequently used anesthetic agent for cardiac catheterization procedures in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease. Previous reports both suggest and deny ketamine's pulmonary vasoreactive effects. Since the advent of sophisticated noninvasive equipment, one of the few indications for cardiac catheterization is to obtain accurate pressure data. If ketamine alters pulmonary vascular resistance, it would negate the primary reason for the procedure. Because the patient population studied herein resides greater than or equal to 1,200 meters above sea level, concerns about pharmacologic effects on pulmonary vascular resistance are enhanced. Simultaneous pulmonary artery and aortic pressures, thermodilution cardiac outputs, and blood gases were measured in room air (16% oxygen) and with ketamine infusion in 14 patients at cardiac catheterization. Reaction to hypoxia identified 3 groups: normal, intermediate and hyperresponders. The normal responders had normal resistance ratios (0.11) in room air and had little resistance ratio response to hypoxia (+0.02), hyperoxia (-0.03) or ketamine (+0.01). The intermediate responders had a slightly higher but normal resistance ratio (0.20) in room air, and a moderate reaction to hypoxia (+0.13), hyperoxia (-0.08) and ketamine (+0.11). The hyperresponders had an elevated resistance ratio (0.42) in room air and a striking reaction to hypoxia (+0.65), hyperoxia (-0.17) and ketamine (+0.49). Hypoxia and ketamine have a greater effect on resistance ratio than hypoxia alone in patients with reactive pulmonary vascular beds. Ketamine should not be used in children undergoing procedures to establish operability based on pulmonary vascular resistance or pulmonary vascular reactivity. 
1	Liver fatty acid-binding protein: a marker for studying cellular differentiation in gut epithelial neoplasms. Human liver fatty acid binding protein is a 127 residue cytoplasmic protein synthesized in liver and in the intestinal epithelium. Previous studies of normal and transgenic mice indicated that the liver fatty acid-binding protein gene is a sensitive marker of enterocytic differentiation. This study shows the use of immunohistochemical methods to examine liver fatty acid-binding protein gene expression in normal human colonic epithelium, colonic villoglandular adenomas, nonmucinous and mucinous adenocarcinomas, and several types of noncolonic epithelial neoplasms. Cells containing liver fatty acid-binding protein were found in normal colonic epithelium, in two thirds of colorectal villoglandular adenomas and nonmucinous adenocarcinomas, and in one third of mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in noncolonic, nonhepatic carcinomas. All liver fatty acid-binding protein-positive colonic adenomas and adenocarcinomas contained patches of immunoreactive cells distributed among histologically identical patches of cells without liver fatty acid-binding protein immunoreactivity. This "mosaicism" was also found in metastases from liver fatty acid-binding protein-positive colonic adenocarcinomas. Immunostaining of these liver fatty acid-binding protein-positive tissues for carcinoembryonic antigen did not show a mosaic cellular pattern in its expression. These data suggest that within a given neoplasm, differences exist in the differentiation programs of monoclonally-derived, malignant colonic epithelial cells and that liver fatty acid-binding protein is a useful marker for operationally defining these subpopulations. Liver fatty acid-binding protein is also a potentially useful diagnostic marker for colorectal and hepatic carcinomas. 
4	Post-transplant hypertension. Post-transplant hypertension remains an important risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and graft function. There are multiple mechanisms responsible for post-transplant hypertension. The details of these mechanisms are poorly understood. Steroids, acute and chronic rejection, recurrent renal disease, native kidney disease, and renal artery stenosis have all been implicated in causing post-transplant hypertension. With the addition of cyclosporine, a known hypertensive agent, to the immunosuppressive armamentarium, the evaluation of post-transplantation hypertension has become difficult. Presently, medical therapy is initially directed toward the complications of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity. Empirically, converting enzyme inhibitors are added to the antihypertensive regimen. Further management is aimed at identification of specific causes of post-transplant hypertension. Unfortunately, because of the multifactorial etiology of post-transplant hypertension and a lack of detailed information about the mechanisms, medical and surgical therapy are often unrewarding. Further study is needed to clarify the mechanisms involved in post-transplant hypertension, and thus direct therapy. 
1	Oral diseases in older adults [clinical conference] In the case presented, a 65-year-old man with multiple dental, medical, and social problems benefited from interdisciplinary assessment and treatment. Despite his poor oral-health status and oral-health behaviors upon admission, patient education and dental therapy resulted in improved daily oral hygiene, elimination of oral diseases, and improved oral function. The overall quality of life of any individual, particularly an older one, can be enhanced through oral-disease prevention, health promotion, and, when indicated, dental therapy. This patient was treated in a hospital environment with a well-established team approach to geriatric care. However, regardless of the care setting, the physician can play a key role in improving the oral health status and quality of life of older adults by including an oral screening examination as part of the periodic comprehensive geriatric assessment, recognizing oral pathology, requesting dental consultations and encouraging appropriate dental service utilization. 
4	Traumatic rupture of aorta. Diagnosis by Doppler echocardiography. Traumatic rupture of aorta is a serious complication in accidents, mainly road accidents, with a high mortality unless an immediate diagnosis and surgical correction is made. A case of traumatic rupture of the aorta shown in the acute phase by Doppler-echocardiography is reported. This technique can be of great value in the study of patients with thoracic trauma who do not show clear signs of aortic rupture which require urgent aortography. 
5	Reciprocal inhibition between forearm muscles in spastic hemiplegia. We studied reciprocal inhibition of H-reflexes in the forearm flexor and extensor muscles in 14 patients with spastic hemiplegia secondary to a focal cerebral lesion and 14 normal volunteers. In the spastic limb, the Hmax/Mmax ratio was increased in both flexor and particularly extensor wrist muscles. The 3 normal inhibitory phases of reciprocal inhibition between extensor and flexor forearm muscles were markedly reduced on the spastic side of patients. The early disynaptic phase showed the greatest alteration. Reduced or absent inhibition between forearm muscles associated with increased spinal motoneuron excitability may be typical to spastic hemiplegia. 
1	Nonhomologous chromatid exchange in hereditary and sporadic renal cell carcinomas. For the development of renal cell carcinomas, it has been suggested that a germ-line or somatic mutation occurs on one of the homologous chromosomes 3p, and subsequently the other 3p segment is lost. We have examined the karyotype and/or the allelic combination on chromosomes 3 and 5 by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis in normal kidney and tumor samples from 28 renal cell carcinomas that developed in two patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease; we then compared the results to those of sporadic tumors. An unbalanced translocation between chromosome 3p and 5q or other chromosomes was found to be the most common aberration. We developed a model of nonhomologous chromatid exchange involving breakpoint clusters at chromosomes 3p13, 3p11.2, 5q22, and 8q11.2. Subsequent chromatid segregation may result in net loss of the 3p segment either (i) in one step or (ii) after a nondisjunctional loss of the derivative chromosome carrying the 3p segment. This general mechanism could also be implicated to explain genetic changes occurring in other types of solid tumors. 
2	Spontaneous pneumoperitoneum. A surgical dilemma. Pneumoperitoneum is usually the result of hollow viscus perforation with associated peritonitis. Nonsurgical spontaneous pneumoperitoneum incidental to intrathoracic, intra-abdominal, gynecologic, iatrogenic, and other miscellaneous causes not associated with perforated viscus have been documented in the literature. Seven cases of spontaneous pneumoperitoneum admitted over 3-year period to Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia are reported. Six patients with pneumoperitoneum underwent exploratory laparotomy when clinical examination suggested an acute abdomen; no intra-abdominal pathology was documented in any of these patients. A seventh patient, on ventilatory support, was managed conservatively after performing a diagnostic peritoneal lavage that was negative. There were no cases of radiographically misdiagnosed pneumoperitoneum. Pneumoperitoneum, preceded by a reasonable incidental cause in a patient with a adequate abdominal examination, may warrant continued observation thus avoiding an unnecessary laparotomy. 
4	Nisoldipine--effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and catecholamines. Studies in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. We have studied the effects of nisoldipine, a new calcium channel antagonist, on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and on plasma catecholamines in 10 healthy volunteers and in 29 patients with primary essential hypertension. Of these 29 patients, thirteen had normal renin hypertension (NRH), and sixteen had low renin hypertension (LRH). Eight healthy volunteers received placebo. Short-term (24 h) effects were measured in all subjects and long-term (up to 6 months) effects of 10-40 mg nisoldipine daily were monitored in the 29 hypertensive patients. Plasma renin activity (PRA) increased slightly, although this rise was not statistically significant, 1 h after the first dose of nisoldipine in both normotensive subjects and hypertensive patients. After 2 h PRA had returned to the pre-treatment level. No change in PRA was observed after administration of placebo. Plasma angiotensin II (AII) levels showed considerable variation after nisoldipine administration. Plasma aldosterone levels decreased despite the increase in PRA and AII concentrations. However, no concomitant reduction in urinary aldosterone excretion was observed. Plasma noradrenaline levels increased slightly 2-4 h after administration of nisoldipine, and decreased again thereafter, but no changes in plasma adrenaline levels were seen. Nisoldipine had no long-term effects on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or on serum catecholamine levels. 
5	Increased sympathetic outflow in cirrhosis and ascites: direct evidence from intraneural recordings. OBJECTIVE: To determine if central sympathetic outflow is increased in patients with cirrhosis and ascites. PATIENTS: Eleven patients with cirrhosis and ascites, 8 patients with cirrhosis but without ascites, and 7 age-matched and 8 young healthy volunteers. METHODS: With subjects supine, direct microneurographic recordings of efferent post-ganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity were obtained from the peroneal nerve, and sympathetic burst frequency was compared with subjects' blood pressure, heart rate, sodium excretion, catecholamines, and plasma renin activity. All patients with cirrhosis were studied at least 5 days after withdrawal from all medications and after 7 days of a 20 mmol/d sodium, 1-L fluid-restricted diet. Age-matched volunteers were studied after 7 days of 20 mmol/d sodium intake and young healthy volunteers after 7 days of 150 mmol/d sodium intake. RESULTS: Sympathetic nerve activity in ascitic patients (65 +/- 15 bursts/min; mean +/- SD) was markedly increased, whether compared with patients with cirrhosis but without ascites (34 +/- 16 bursts/min; P less than 0.001), age-matched healthy volunteers on similar sodium intake (27 +/- 22 bursts/min; P less than 0.001), or young healthy subjects (21 +/- 10 bursts/min; P less than 0.001). The frequency of muscle sympathetic nerve discharge was directly related to plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations, plasma renin activity, and heart rate, all of which were increased in those patients with cirrhosis and ascites, and inversely related to 24-hour urinary sodium excretion, the fractional excretion of sodium, and subjects' pulse pressures. Sympathetic nerve activity fell from 78 to 6 bursts/min in one patient after liver transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first direct evidence that elevated plasma norepinephrine concentrations in patients with cirrhosis and ascites are due to increased central sympathetic outflow. Sympathetic nerve activity is not increased in patients with cirrhosis but without ascites. Because there were direct positive correlations of sympathetic nerve activity with plasma norepinephrine concentrations, plasma epinephrine concentrations, plasma renin activity, and heart rate, the increase in central sympathetic outflow in patients with cirrhosis and ascites appears generalized and not restricted to muscle nerves. The anti-natriuretic effects of parallel increases in renal and muscle sympathetic nerve activity could account for the inverse correlation between muscle sympathetic nerve activity and sodium excretion. 
4	Remodeling of the rat right and left ventricles in experimental hypertension. Pathological left ventricular hypertrophy in renovascular hypertension is associated with the accumulation of fibrillar collagen within the extracellular space and around intramyocardial coronary arteries. Even though the angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor captopril was previously found to attenuate this interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, the relative importance of arterial and ventricular systolic pressures versus circulating angiotensin II (AII) and aldosterone (AL) in promoting hypertrophy and collagen accumulation in renovascular hypertension is uncertain. By drawing on the in-parallel arrangement of the right and left ventricles, with respect to their coronary circulation, and the in-series mechanical alignment of the ventricles, with a pressure-overloaded left and a normotensive right ventricle, this study sought to address this uncertainty. Three models of experimental hypertension, each having a different circulating AII and AL profile, were examined and compared with their controls: renovascular hypertension, where both AII and AL are increased; infrarenal aorta banding, where AII and AL are normal; and a chronic infusion of AL, where AII is suppressed or normal and AL is increased. In renovascular hypertension, as well as with AL, we found a significant rise in the interstitial collagen volume fraction and perivascular collagen area of the pressure-overloaded, hypertrophied left ventricle as well as the normotensive, nonhypertrophied right ventricle. This remodeling was not seen in either ventricle with infrarenal aorta banding despite comparable systemic hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, in experimental arterial hypertension in the rat, myocyte and nonmyocyte compartments of the myocardium are under separate controls: myocyte hypertrophy is most closely related to ventricular loading while circulating AII and AL, acting alone or in concert with other humoral factors, regulate the accumulation of collagen within the right and left ventricles. 
3	Prognostic significance of multimodality evoked response testing in high-risk newborns. Exposure to hypoxic-ischemic events in fetal or neonatal life may lead to permanent brain damage and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficits. Clinical and diagnostic tools have been somewhat helpful in identifying an at-risk group, particularly those patients sustaining significant neurologic sequelae. In this prospective study, the prognostic significance of multimodality evoked responses in high-risk newborns was examined. A group of 44 high-risk newborns, as well as 14 healthy newborns, were tested during the newborn period with auditory brainstem responses and somatosensory evoked responses; these tests were repeated at 2 and 6 months corrected age. A neonatal neurologic examination, the Einstein Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale, was also conducted. At 1 year corrected age, both groups were assessed in a blind fashion by a pediatric neurologist and a psychologist to determine neurodevelopmental outcome. Results indicated that somatosensory evoked response abnormalities in particular predict an abnormal neurologic status at 1 year of age. Abnormalities that persisted or worsened correlated with severe neurologic impairment, whereas an abnormal somatosensory evoked response that improved or normalized in infancy was associated with mild to moderate neurologic sequelae. Increased brainstem conduction in the auditory brainstem responses was also associated with neurologic sequelae. Normal findings from auditory brainstem responses and somatosensory evoked responses predicted normal developmental scores in all areas, as well as a normal neurologic outcome at 1 year with negative predictive powers ranging from 85-100%. Evoked response testing appears to be an important adjunct to the neurologic investigation of high-risk newborns. 
4	Introduction: nutritional aspects of palm oil. The production, composition, and food uses of palm oil are outlined in this introduction to a detailed appraisal of the nutritional and health implications of the use of palm oil in the food supply. The putative role of dietary fats and oils in general, and of palm oil in particular, in the etiology of coronary heart disease and cancer is critically assessed. It is concluded that the evidence available is difficult to interpret unambiguously. Some evidence to suggest that the minor components of palm oil might have useful biological effects is also discussed. 
1	Squamous cell carcinoma-antigen for detection of squamous cell and mucoepidermoid carcinoma after primary treatment: a preliminary report. This study evaluated the efficacy of using the periodic measurement of the serum level of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-antigen) for determining the local recurrence and/or metastasis of squamous cell and mucoepidermoid carcinomas after primary treatment. It was found that at the time of clinical recognition of recurrence, the SCC-antigen level was normal, but metastasis to regional lymph nodes or to remote organs generally was accompanied by an increase of SCC-antigen. Changes in the SCC-antigen level with mucoepidermoid carcinoma seemed to be less sensitive than with squamous cell carcinoma. 
4	A controlled trial of community based coronary rehabilitation. Two hundred patients who had suffered an acute myocardial infarction 4-6 weeks before entered a randomised controlled trial of exercise treatment at a community sports centre supervised by a general practitioner. Eighty one per cent of the treatment group continued to exercise until they returned to work and 73% completed three months' exercise. There were no serious complications of the exercise course. The prevalence of angina pectoris fell by 10% in the treatment group but rose by 60% in the control group. The perceived energy level rose by significantly more in the treatment group than in the controls. The rise in predicted maximum oxygen uptake was significantly greater in the treatment group than in the control group as was the reduction in the double product (a reflection of myocardial workload) at peak exercise. Coronary rehabilitation in the community can be both safe and effective. 
4	Hyperhomocysteinemia: an independent risk factor for vascular disease. BACKGROUND. Hyperhomocysteinemia arising from impaired methionine metabolism, probably usually due to a deficiency of cystathionine beta-synthase, is associated with premature cerebral, peripheral, and possibly coronary vascular disease. Both the strength of this association and its independence of other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are uncertain. We studied the extent to which the association could be explained by heterozygous cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. METHODS. We first established a diagnostic criterion for hyperhomocysteinemia by comparing peak serum levels of homocysteine after a standard methionine-loading test in 25 obligate heterozygotes with respect to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency (whose children were known to be homozygous for homocystinuria due to this enzyme defect) with the levels in 27 unrelated age- and sex-matched normal subjects. A level of 24.0 mumol per liter or more was 92 percent sensitive and 100 percent specific in distinguishing the two groups. The peak serum homocysteine levels in these normal subjects were then compared with those in 123 patients whose vascular disease had been diagnosed before they were 55 years of age. RESULTS. Hyperhomocysteinemia was detected in 16 of 38 patients with cerebrovascular disease (42 percent), 7 of 25 with peripheral vascular disease (28 percent), and 18 of 60 with coronary vascular disease (30 percent), but in none of the 27 normal subjects. After adjustment for the effects of conventional risk factors, the lower 95 percent confidence limit for the odds ratio for vascular disease among the patients with hyperhomocysteinemia, as compared with the normal subjects, was 3.2. The geometric-mean peak serum homocysteine level was 1.33 times higher in the patients with vascular disease than in the normal subjects (P = 0.002). The presence of cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency was confirmed in 18 of 23 patients with vascular disease who had hyperhomocysteinemia. CONCLUSIONS. Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for vascular disease, including coronary disease, and in most instances is probably due to cystathionine beta-synthase deficiency. 
5	Polyarteritis nodosa presenting as a biliary stricture. Polyarteritis nodosa, a disease of the media of small and medium-sized arteries, has protean manifestations and many presenting signs and symptoms. Gastrointestinal involvement is common but involvement of the biliary tree is rare. We report a unique case of polyarteritis presenting as a biliary stricture. 
5	The use of Molteno implant and anterior chamber tube shunt to encircling band for the treatment of glaucoma in keratoplasty patients. This retrospective study reviews the results of 35 keratoplasty patients with complex corneal and glaucoma disease, who received Molteno-type (n = 25) or anterior chamber tube shunt to encircling band (ACTSEB)-type (n = 10) implant for the treatment of difficult glaucomas. The implant was placed before the keratoplasty in 14 eyes, during the keratoplasty procedure in 6 eyes, and subsequent to the corneal surgery in 15 eyes. Mean follow-up for the keratoplasty was 25.46 months (range, 6-58 months) and 24.74 months (range, 7-42 months) for the seton procedure. Graft rejection occurred in 12 (34%) of 35 eyes and was progressive in 9 eyes. Nonimmunologic failure was seen in 9 (26%) of 35 eyes. Grafts were repeated in ten eyes with eight of these (80%) remaining clear at a mean of 14.4 months. Considering the results of the repeat grafts, 25 (71%) of 35 eyes achieved clear transplants. Overall, 46% of patients had final visual acuities of 20/100 or better and 69% had final visual acuities of 20/400 or better. The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) of 34.54 mmHg (range, 14-68 mmHg; standard deviation [SD], 11.51) was lowered to a mean of 14.65 mmHg (range, 6-30 mmHg; SD, 4.49). In the final analysis, 30 (86%) of 35 eyes were judged successful from a glaucoma standpoint. We conclude that the Molteno- and ACTSEB-type implants are viable treatment alternatives in this difficult glaucoma group. 
5	Pneumonia complicating abdominal sepsis. An independent risk factor for mortality. Nosocomial pneumonia (NP) is associated with a significant mortality, 66% in a previous retrospective study of NP complicating intra-abdominal sepsis (IAS). We prospectively compared the outcome of NP complicating IAS with that of recurrent IAS (R-IAS) in the absence of NP. Data were collected prospectively on 300 patients with IAS; 34 patients who presented with pneumonia were excluded from the analysis (44% mortality). One hundred seventy-one patients with no NP and no R-IAS (group 1) had a hospital mortality of 20% (34 patients); 36 without NP in whom R-IAS developed (group 2) had a 17% mortality (six patients); and 47 with NP but no R-IAS (group 3) had a 53% mortality (25 patients). Finally, 12 patients who had both NP and R-IAS suffered a 75% mortality (nine patients). We examined the relationships among the following putative risk factors and mortality: APACHE (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) II score (at initial presentation with IAS), the need for mechanical ventilatory assistance following initial treatment for peritonitis, steroid requirement, generalized peritonitis vs abscess, and the need for surgical as opposed to percutaneous treatment. Using mortality as the dependent variable, group 2 vs 3 as the explanatory variable, and the risk factors as confounders, logistic regression analysis indicated that the group difference was significant after controlling for confounders. We conclude that NP complicating IAS is an independent risk factor associated with a significant mortality compared with R-IAS. These data challenge the notion that death in IAS is usually due to recurrent or persistent intra-abdominal infection. 
5	Scleroderma and L-tryptophan: a possible explanation of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Scleroderma developed in six women who were taking L-tryptophan. Fasciitis and morphea were most common, but one patient had pleural effusion, hypertension, and signs of cardiac and kidney failure. In five patients the biopsy findings were characteristic of scleroderma; the sixth patient had Crohn's disease and developed fasciitis; her biopsy specimen showed inflammatory arteritis. All patients' conditions improved after cessation of their L-tryptophan intake, initiation of corticosteroid therapy, or both. These findings confirm previous data that show altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in some patients with scleroderma and fasciitis, particularly with tryptophan loading. 
4	Recanalization of chronic total coronary arterial occlusions by percutaneous excimer-laser and laser-assisted angioplasty. A low primary success and high restenosis rate after recanalization of chronic total occlusions by conventional coronary angioplasty have encouraged the application of new interventional techniques like excimer-laser angioplasty. In 39 patients with a coronary occlusion for 1 to 12 months, recanalization was attempted by laser angioplasty through a multifiber-catheter coupled to a pulsed XeCl excimer laser. After successful passage of the occlusion by a standard guidewire in 27 patients (69%), the laser catheter was advanced over the central guidewire and crossed the occlusion in 25 patients (64%). In 2 patients with unsuccessful passage of the laser catheter, the subsequent attempt with a low profile balloon catheter also failed. In 19 of the 25 patients with successful laser recanalization, the residual stenosis exceeded 50% and was therefore followed by additional balloon angioplasty. The average residual stenosis after laser was 61 +/- 17% of the vessel diameter, and after balloon angioplasty 28 +/- 9% (n = 19), whereas after laser angioplasty alone it was 38 +/- 5% (n = 6). No complications associated with the laser application were observed. Angiographic control after 24 hours showed a reocclusion of 2 (8%) recanalized vessels. In this pilot study, laser angioplasty proved to be a safe and feasible method for the treatment of chronic total coronary occlusions. Because it was necessary to guide the catheter by a central wire, the primary success was limited by a successful passage of the wire of the occlusion. The rate of stand-alone laser angioplasty has to be increased by future improvements of the technique to enable a comparative evaluation of this method with conventional angioplasty. 
2	Sphincter of Oddi manometry: decreased risk of clinical pancreatitis with use of a modified aspirating catheter. This study was undertaken to determine whether routine use of a modified triple-lumen five French sphincter of Oddi manometry catheter would reduce the frequency and severity of post-manometry pancreatitis and pancreatic enzyme elevation. Seventy-six patients were alternately assigned to undergo sphincter of Oddi manometry (SOM) with a standard perfusion (infused group) catheter or the newly developed aspiration (aspirated group) catheter. After SOM, there were significantly more patients in the infused group with both amylase and lipase values elevated at least two times the upper limits of normal at 2 (p less than 0.001), 6 (p = 0.01), and 18 hours (p = 0.03) after the procedure. As compared with the standard perfusion system, the aspiration catheter was associated with a decreased frequency of clinical pancreatitis (23.5% vs. 3%, p = 0.01) reduced hospital stay (5 +/- 1.83 days, mean +/- SE, versus 1 day; p = 0.03) and milder pancreatitis. The aspiration manometry catheter should be considered for standard use for SOM, particularly if the pancreatic duct sphincter is being evaluated. 
3	Trial of brief intermittent neuroleptic prophylaxis for selected schizophrenic outpatients: clinical and social outcome at two years. OBJECTIVE--To evaluate a novel approach to the prophylaxis of schizophrenic relapse characterised by administration of brief courses of neuroleptic for the earliest non-psychotic signs of relapse (prodromal symptoms). DESIGN--Two year follow up of subjects randomised, double blind, to receive either active (control group) or placebo (intermittent group) depot neuroleptic medication. Both groups received brief courses of oral neuroleptic when prodromal symptoms or relapse occurred. SETTING--Psychiatric outpatient department, Charing Cross Hospital, London. SUBJECTS--54 Stable patients in remission who met the American Psychiatric Association's DSM-III criteria for schizophrenia on the basis of case notes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Survival without relapse, survival without hospitalisation, point prevalence of extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia, structured assessment of social functioning (social adjustment scale II), and frequency of prodromal symptoms. RESULTS--Of 19 relapses recorded over two years, 10 (53%) were preceded by non-psychotic prodromal signs. Survival rates for both relapse and hospitalisation were worse with intermittent treatment than continuous treatment over the two year follow up: 92% of controls and only 54% of patients given intermittent treatment survived the two year period without hospitalisation. Prolonged or frequent relapses as well as episodes of prodromal symptoms were more frequent with intermittent treatment. Lower scores for extrapyramidal side effects were recorded in the intermittent treatment group, but periodic assessments of social functioning failed to show any social advantages from this. CONCLUSION--The findings are at variance with a previous report of one year follow up in this cohort and attest to the superiority of continuous depot neuroleptic prophylaxis in preventing both psychotic and neurotic or dysphoric morbidity in schizophrenia. 
4	Epidemiologic and immunogenetic aspects of polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis in northern Italy. We studied the epidemiology of giant cell arteritis (GCA) and polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) in a Mediterranean population. Ninety-nine patients with PMR and/or GCA were identified over a 9-year period (1980-1988) in Reggio Emilia, Italy. The average annual incidence of PMR and GCA was 12.7/100,000 and 6.9/100,000, respectively, in a population aged 50 years or older. Frequencies of HLA antigens were determined in 49 patients with PMR and/or GCA who were followed by staff at our rheumatology unit during the 1980-1988 period. When compared with HLA findings in 242 healthy controls, DR4 was not found to be significantly associated with PMR (24% in PMR patients versus 14% in controls). Patients with GCA also showed an increased frequency of DR4 compared with controls (36% versus 14%), but this difference was also not statistically significant. The immunogenetic features of PMR and GCA and the relationship between the immunogenetic and epidemiologic patterns in different populations are discussed. 
4	Hypertrophy, fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction in early canine experimental hypertension. To examine the relations among hypertrophy, fibrosis and diastolic performance in early experimental hypertension, 18 control dogs and 12 dogs with experimental left ventricular hypertrophy were studied. Diastolic function was impaired in dogs with left ventricular hypertrophy, with decreased Doppler early to atrial inflow velocity ratio (E/A) (1.35 versus 1.72), increased atrial filling fraction (35% versus 29%), decreased sonomicrometric peak rates of wall thinning (-2.01 versus -3.37 liters/s) and filling (4.33 versus 6.64 liters/s) and prolonged time constant of isovolumetric relaxation (tau; 34.3 versus 28.1 ms). Neither chamber stiffness (k; P = AekV) nor passive elastic stiffness (E; E = k sigma, where sigma = stress) was increased. At postmortem examination, the hypertensive left ventricle weighed significantly more than normal (116 versus 80 g; p less than 0.01) and had greater muscle fiber diameter at endocardial and epicardial sampling sites in the apical free wall, basal free wall and septum (mean diameter 50 +/- 8 microns in hypertensive dogs, 37 +/- 8 microns in normal dogs; p less than 0.01). In contrast, neither percent fibrosis (1.2 +/- 0.8 versus 0.9 +/- 0.6 in normal dogs) nor fibrotic volume (1.21 +/- 0.63 versus 0.72 +/- 0.42%/g in normal dogs) was significantly increased. Peak volumetric filling rate was inversely related to fiber diameter (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001), although no variable of left ventricular function was significantly related to percent or volume fibrosis (all r less than 0.60, all p greater than 0.05). Thus, diastolic dysfunction may exist in the setting of hypertrophy without significant fibrosis. Increased myocyte size was associated with early diastolic filling abnormalities characteristic of the hypertensive left ventricle. Fibrosis appears to be a less important determinant of diastolic performance. 
3	Candida pyelonephritis complicating traumatic C5 quadriplegia: diagnosis and management. We present the first reported case of Candida pyelonephritis in a spinal cord injured patient. In addition to multiple courses of empiric antibiotics, the neurogenic bladder and alteration in cell-mediated immunity found in spinal cord injured patients may have increased this patient's susceptibility to fungal disease. A 50-year-old patient with C5 motor functional quadriplegia developed Candid albicans pyelonephritis while undergoing rehabilitation. The patient had several surgical procedures and multiple courses of antibiotic therapy during acute hospitalization. He continued to have a hectic fever curve, leukocytosis with increased band forms, lethargy, and progressive uremia during rehabilitation. Successful investigation of the patient's condition included assessment of serologic tests for Candida precipitin antigen; multiple blood and urine cultures; exclusion of other causes of hectic fever; abdominal computerized tomogram, which revealed a left kidney hypodensity with irregular margins; and a retrograde pyelogram, which demonstrated multiple renal pelvic-filling defects. Cystoscopically placed ureteral stents, which relieved the genitourinary obstruction, drained gross pus from which Candida albicans was cultured; the patient was treated with amphotericin B and showed clinical improvement. Pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of Candida pyelonephritis are reviewed. 
2	Incisional parapubic hernias. A parapubic hernia, distinct from other lower abdominal wall hernias, is identified as a particular type of incisional hernia. This hernia results from the disruption of the musculotendinous elements of the abdominal wall as they insert into the pubis. This disruption is brought about by either the destruction of these musculotendinous tissues at their lower end or the resection of portions of the pubic bone as is sometimes done in suprapubic radical prostatectomies for easier access to the prostate. Seven cases have been identified and reported. Men and women were seen to make up a clinical picture that is suggestive of the diagnosis, namely, multiple previous operations through the lower abdominal wall, procedures of a gynecologic or urologic nature, a herniation that mimics an incisional or inguinal hernia, and a defect that cannot possibly be corrected without the use of a prosthesis. When the diagnosis is accurately established, the polypropylene mesh is inserted in the preperitoneal space and anchored laterally to the ligaments of Cooper and in between to the arcuate pubic ligament and the periosteum of the posterior aspect of the pubis. Excellent results have been obtained, and the success must be ascribed to the recognition of the parapubic hernia as a distinct entity. 
4	Inhibition of norepinephrine release from vascular adrenergic neurons by oral administration of beta-blocker in DOCA-salt hypertension. The ability of a beta-blocker to inhibit vascular sympathetic nerve activity associated with hypertension was studied in DOCA-salt hypertension in rats. A seven week treatment of DOCA and salt resulted in a significant increase in the systolic blood pressure of the uninephrectomized rats. The administration of propranolol (40 mg/L and 80 mg/L in drinking water) had little effect on the development of hypertension. After a three week administration of propranolol, perfused mesenteric vasculatures were prepared in vitro, and endogenous norepinephrine release as well as vascular responsiveness were examined. Endogenous norepinephrine and pressor responses during periarterial nerve stimulation were greater in the untreated DOCA-salt hypertensive rats than in the normotensive rats. In the DOCA-salt hypertensive rats treated with propranolol, the stimulation-evoked norepinephrine release and pressor responses were significantly attenuated, at both doses, compared with the untreated DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. These results demonstrate that propranolol inhibited the vascular sympathetic nerve activity in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. This occurrence suggests a possible role of presynaptic beta-adrenoceptors in the regulation of sympathetic tone in DOCA-salt hypertension. 
2	Deceptive bizarre stromal cells in polyps and ulcers of the gastrointestinal tract. The clinical and pathologic features of 33 pseudomalignant lesions of the gastrointestinal tract with bizarre stromal cells are reported. Deceptive histologic changes were identified in ulcers of seven patients and in inflammatory polyps of 26. A misdiagnosis of malignant neoplasm was made in six of the 33 patients (three polyps and three ulcers). A history of gastrointestinal bleeding and/or inflammatory bowel disease was common. The bizarre stromal cells were usually distributed beneath the ulcerated mucosa or within granulation tissue. They stained strongly for vimentin in 20 of 23 cases. Some of the bizarre cells also stained for muscle specific actin (seven of 23 cases). The cells appear to be reactive fibroblasts or myofibroblasts. Follow-up information obtained on 24 of the 33 patients (including four of the six cases initially diagnosed as malignant) revealed 22 patients to be alive without evidence of a malignant neoplasm (average follow-up, 13 months). Two patients died of other causes. Correct recognition of these bizarre stromal cells in gastrointestinal ulcers and inflammatory polyps will prevent a potentially serious diagnostic pitfall. 
5	Increasing the yield of ventricular tachycardia induction: a prospective, randomized comparative study of the standard ventricular stimulation protocol to a short-to-long protocol and a new two-site protocol. Programmed ventricular stimulation with a standard protocol that used up to three extrastimuli was compared prospectively with a short-to-long protocol and a two-site protocol in 77 consecutive patients undergoing electrophysiologic study in an attempt to increase the yield of ventricular tachycardia (VT) induction. The short-to-long protocol uses a train of eight stimuli at a short cycle length and up to two extrastimuli. The two-site protocol is similar to the standard protocol but delivers the last extrastimulus via a second spatially separated right ventricular catheter. Patients were divided into two groups based on indications for study: group 1 included 45 patients with syncope, nonsustained VT, or both, and group 2 included 32 patients with a history of sustained VT, sudden cardiac death, or both. The yield of VT induction with the short-to-long protocol was less than that with the standard protocol. In none of the patients in group 1 in whom the standard protocol results were negative did the short-to-long protocol produce sustained VT. Only two patients, both in group 2, had sustained arrhythmias induced by the short-to-long protocol when the standard protocol results were negative: one had sustained VT induced and one with long QT syndrome had ventricular fibrillation (VF) induced with the short-to-long protocol. However, the short-to-long protocol failed to induce sustained VT in seven patients in whom the standard protocol produced sustained VT. All seven of these patients required three extrastimuli with the standard protocol for induction of VT. 
4	Systolic hypertension in the elderly: reasons not to treat. Isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Accurate measurement of blood pressure in older patients is difficult. Therapy can be associated with various complications, and the special problems of the elderly, such as orthostatic hypotension and hyperkalemia, should be carefully considered. Drugs should be used in low doses and changes in dosage should be made infrequently. Patients should be monitored frequently for untoward effects of therapy. The benefits of blood pressure reduction and the optimal degree of blood pressure reduction remain unknown. 
3	Motor unit discharge characteristics and short term synchrony in paraplegic humans. Frequency of firing and regularity of discharge of human motor units, and short term synchrony between pairs of motor units, have been assessed in extensor digitorum communis (EDC) and tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in control subjects and in clinically complete paraplegic subjects. The discharge pattern of TA motor units in paraplegia ranged from extremely regular to very irregular for different motor units whereas in the control population, and in EDC of both groups, there was a narrow, but intermediate, range of regularity. There was little difference in the incidence and degree of short term synchrony (STS) in EDC between paraplegic and normal subjects. In contrast, virtually no STS of motor units was observed in the TA muscles of the paraplegic group whereas control subjects exhibited approximately the same amount of STS in their TA and EDC muscles. It is concluded that the extra burden placed on arm muscles in paraplegia does not change the amount of synchronisation between motor units. Furthermore, section of the spinal cord does not increase STS as predicted from lesions of the reticulospinal tract in cats. This may reflect the coincidental removal of supraspinal synchronising inputs of motoneurons or the reorganisation of synaptic inputs in chronic paraplegia. 
5	Vigabatrin: rational treatment for chronic epilepsy. Vigabatrin is a selective, irreversible suicide inhibitor of GABA transaminase and thus increases brain and CSF GABA. In 33 adult patients with long standing refractory epilepsy on treatment with one or two standard anti-convulsant drugs, the addition of vigabatrin up to 3g daily for eight weeks was associated with a 48.2% reduction in seizure frequency. Twenty patients who had exhibited a 50% or more reduction in frequency of one or more seizure types entered an eight week double-blind placebo controlled phase. Patients on vigabatrin maintained a 54.7% reduction of seizure frequency, whereas those on placebo showed an 18.6% increase in seizure frequency, a highly significant difference between the two groups. In the open phase, seven patients were withdrawn due to unacceptable and reversible adverse events. The commonest side effects were drowsiness, depression and mood instability, and headaches. Vigabatrin is a potentially valuable new treatment for chronic epilepsy, especially partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation. 
5	Clinical and Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of bioprosthetic valve failure after 10 years. Four hundred thirteen consecutive patients underwent valve replacement with a bioprosthesis between 1976 and 1982. Aortic valve replacement was performed in 240 patients, mitral valve replacement in 132 patients, and multiple valve replacement in 41. The Carpentier-Edwards porcine (n = 336), Angell-Shiley porcine (n = 23), Hancock porcine (n = 11), and the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valves (n = 43) were inserted. Follow-up between 5 and 12 years postoperatively was 98% complete. Freedom from structural valve deterioration was 72 +/- 7%, 59 +/- 9%, and 59 +/- 9%, respectively, after aortic, mitral, and double valve replacement. The risk of structural valve deterioration and reoperation for valve-related complications was significantly increased with the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial prosthesis. The risk for reoperation was inversely related to patient age. Postoperative Doppler echocardiographic studies in 87% of available patients revealed a subgroup of asymptomatic patients with evidence of structural valve deterioration. These patients (n = 61) had significantly reduced prosthetic valve areas (aortic less than 1 cm2, mitral less than 1.7 cm2), elevated resting transvalvular gradients (aortic greater than 40 mm Hg), or moderate-to-severe regurgitation. In summary, postoperative Doppler echocardiographic examination identified asymptomatic patients with structural valve dysfunction. These patients must be followed up carefully to determine the optimal timing of reoperation. 
5	Incidence of myocarditis. A 10-year autopsy study from Malmo, Sweden. Although myocarditis has been known for almost two centuries, data in regard to its incidence have varied widely. Autopsy studies have reported an incidence of 3.5% to as high as 10%. The main reason for such diversity of data appears to be the lack of unanimity as to what constitutes myocarditis. Recently, definitions of myocarditis have been proposed and precise criteria for the morphologic recognition of myocarditis have been published. In this study an analysis of 12,747 consecutive autopsies performed from 1975 to 1984 at Malmo (Sweden) General Hospital was carried out. Applying the newly proposed histologic criteria, the diagnosis of myocarditis was made in 136 cases, which constitute 1.06% of the autopsy population studied. This rate of myocarditis incidence at postmortem is lower by far than rates previously published. 
3	Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein screening: further consideration of low-volume testing. Unrecognized assay drift that may occur during low-volume (fewer than 500 specimens per week) maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein testing could result in either underestimation or overestimation of the number of pregnant women who are at increased risk of fetal malformations and genetic anomalies. Quality control software programs that incorporate the use of a multirule Shewhart chart are designed to detect assay drift. Careful selection of quality control sera for inclusion in analytic assays and appropriate application of a multirule quality control procedure to values that are obtained on these control materials should detect assay drift, regardless of the volume of patients' specimens in the run. 
3	Visual dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease: relation to normal aging [published erratum appears in Ann Neurol 1991 Mar;29(3):271] In patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), compared with age-matched and young healthy control subjects, visual deficits in the following functions were observed: color, stereoacuity, contrast sensitivity, and backward masking (homogeneous and pattern). Critical flicker fusion thresholds were normal, relative to age-matched healthy subjects. For color, the majority of the errors were tritanomalous (blue axis). Color and stereoacuity deficits were unrelated to severity of dementia, in accordance with models of vision that describe these functions as modular rather than diffuse for cortical localization. Although contrast sensitivity was depressed throughout the frequency range in AD, more patients were impaired at low than at high spatial frequencies, contrasting with the observed normal aging pattern of high-frequency loss. Healthy elderly subjects showed depressed critical flicker fusion thresholds and reduced contrast sensitivity at high frequencies, relative to the young group; differences between these groups were not found for the other vision tests. A subset of the AD group received detailed neuro-ophthalmological examination, and no abnormalities were found. This finding, taken together with normal thresholds for critical flicker fusion, suggests that the widespread visual dysfunction reported here is more likely to be related to known pathological changes in primary visual and association cortex in AD than to changes in the retina or optic nerve. 
1	Rationale for different chemotherapeutic and radiation therapy strategies in cancer management. The two primary therapeutic strategies in cancer have been to give either chemotherapy and radiation therapy together or give a complete course of one treatment modality before starting the second. Clinical studies show that toxicity has been one of the major deterrents to substantial improvements in cancer management when the two modalities are administered together. On the other hand, the prolonged time necessary to administer all of one modality followed by the other makes it likely that repopulation of the tumor during sequential treatment will diminish therapeutic effectiveness. A third strategy of giving chemotherapy and radiation therapy has been developed. This new regimen was designed to give chemotherapy initially, maintain the chemotherapy schedule to avoid any reduction in its effectiveness, and add radiation therapy as early as possible in between courses of chemotherapy to minimize the development of cross resistance. One of the primary objectives of alternating chemotherapy and radiation therapy is to increase the therapeutic index by reducing toxicity without a significant reduction in therapeutic effectiveness. Recent clinical, experimental, and theoretic results with radiation therapy and chemotherapy for cancer management emphasize the necessity of giving both modalities with the greatest intensity possible in the initial phase of induction therapy. Cancer treatment scheduling determines the toxicity and thereby limits the dose intensity that can be tolerated. Scheduling may also govern the antitumor effect directly; however, normal host tissue makes the determination of the direct effects on the tumor difficult, if not impossible, in clinical studies. Well-defined experimental solid-tumor systems provide the means for determining directly the relationship between toxicity and antitumor effects in relation to tumor burden and total therapeutic dose. In addition, its relationship to dose intensity and scheduling can be determined by the using more sophisticated research techniques, such as response surface methods. Well-defined clinical protocols to determine how to interact chemotherapy with radiation therapy more effectively hold considerable potential for rapid improvement in treatment of radiosensitive and chemosensitive cancers. 
2	Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare disease of unknown etiology. Sclerosis of the bile ducts may actually be the final result of multiple factors such as autoimmune, bacterial, congenital, drug, or viral injury. The most commonly associated diseases are ulcerative colitis and chronic pancreatitis. Except in the earliest stages of the disease, liver histologic findings are not specific. Most patients present with jaundice, pain, and pruritus, although an increasing number of asymptomatic patients with inflammatory bowel disease and abnormal liver function are being identified. Cholangiography is key to the diagnosis and is usually pathognomonic except in the unusual case where primary sclerosing cholangitis is confused with cholangiocarcinoma. Many forms of medical therapy have been tried, including antibiotics, azathioprine, cholestyramine, colchicine, cyclosporine, D-penicillamine, steroids, and ursodeoxycholic acid. To date, none of these medications has been proved to alter the course of this disease. Recent reports of ursodeoxycholic acid trials have been encouraging, but long-term results of ongoing randomized trials have yet to be published. In recent years, balloon dilatation of biliary strictures has been accomplished via endoscopic and percutaneous transhepatic approaches. However, in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis, these nonoperative manipulations must be done repeatedly, may entail multiple general anesthetics, and are difficult to perform. We believe that a direct surgical approach to the biliary tree with long-term transhepatic stenting is indicated in selected patients with severe hilar or extrahepatic stricturing, persistent jaundice or recurrent cholangitis, and no evidence of cirrhosis. Hepatic transplantation should be reserved for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis who have well-established cirrhosis and have not responded to other therapeutic measures. 
4	Severe hypertension after liver transplantation in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Five children with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency and terminal liver disease received liver grafts; all five became hypertensive and four developed hypertensive encephalopathy. There was evidence of renal disease preoperatively and renal biopsy specimens showed variable glomerulonephritic histology with IgA nephropathy in one, mesangial-proliferative changes in two, and mesangio-capillary glomerulonephritis type I in two. Four hypertensive episodes were preceded by a fall in creatinine clearance. The association of glomerulonephritis with alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency in children is more common than has been recognised. Affected patients are prone to severe hypertension of probable renal origin after liver transplantation and the renal lesion may affect long term prognosis. 
5	Suicidal ligature strangulation with an elastic band. An unusual case of self-strangulation with an elastic band is described. The victim was a young Hispanic male with a complicated psychiatric history, including suicide attempts. Mechanisms of strangulation and mechanical asphyxial death are discussed briefly. 
5	PTCA of gastroepiploic bypass. A technique for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of gastroepiploic bypass is described using standard PTCA devices. Severe spasm of gastroepiploic bypass occurred. Modification of guide catheter position is suggested to avoid inducing gastroepiploic bypass spasm. 
5	Permanent external striated sphincter stents in patients with spinal injuries. Nine patients with complete quadriplegia underwent external striated sphincter stenting with the Wallstent in place of an external striated sphincterotomy. Although suprapubic catheters were placed to provide an outlet should problems develop with the stent, they were successfully removed within 6 weeks in all but 1 patient. Complete bladder emptying with reduced voiding pressures was achieved, together with a significant reduction in the duration of hyper-reflexic contractions. Epithelialisation of the stent was almost complete within 3 months and intermittent catheterisation or endoscopy (and resection) is possible through the stent. Although this is a preliminary report of this new technique, it is hoped that sphincter stenting will provide a rapid, safe and effective method of treating high pressure hyper-reflexia and detrusor sphincter dyssynergia in quadriplegic patients. 
3	Management of pseudarthrosis after arthrodesis of the spine for idiopathic scoliosis. Sixty-three first, second, or third-time repairs of one or more pseudarthroses were done in fifty-one patients who had had an arthrodesis for idiopathic scoliosis. Forty-five of the patients were female and six were male. The average age was 30.2 years. The indications for the sixty-three repairs were pain (twenty-five repairs), progression of the curve (sixteen), both pain and progression of the curve (twelve), and radiographic changes only (ten). Failure of the implant was identified before 27 per cent of the sixty-three procedures. The pseudarthroses were diagnosed an average of 2.8 years after the initial arthrodeses. Sixty-eight per cent of the defects were visible on plain radiographs preoperatively and 32 per cent were identified at operation. During the time between the original arthrodeses and the repairs of the pseudarthroses, the scolioses increased by a mean of 7 degrees and the kyphoses, by a mean of 10 degrees. Harrington distraction was the most commonly used instrumentation (twenty-six [41 per cent] of the sixty-three procedures), and autogenous iliac bone was the most commonly used material for the graft (thirty-three [52 per cent] of the procedures). 
1	Vimentin is preferentially expressed in high-grade ductal and medullary, but not in lobular breast carcinomas. Two hundred sixty-two invasive breast carcinomas dating from 1979 to 1984 were tested for vimentin and keratin on formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. None of 26 lobular carcinomas expressed vimentin. Vimentin expression in 10% or more of tumor cells was found in 78% of medullary (14 of 18), in 16% of ductal not otherwise specified (NOS) (35 of 214), and in two of four mucinous carcinomas. A further seven tumors showed vimentin expression in less than 1% to 10% of the cells. Vimentin was expressed in tumor cells of 30% (28 of 93) of grade III invasive ductal NOS carcinomas versus 7% (7 of 105) of grade II and 0% of grade I carcinomas (0 of 10). Vimentin was found to be preferentially expressed in tumors growing in broad, often anastomosing bands or sheets with extensive necrosis, scanty supportive stroma, high nuclear grade, and numerous mitoses. The authors conclude that vimentin is not detected in lobular carcinomas, but is preferentially expressed in medullary and in high-grade ductal NOS breast carcinomas. 
5	Donor leukocyte transfusions for treatment of recurrent chronic myelogenous leukemia in marrow transplant patients. Three patients with hematologic relapse after bone marrow transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia were treated with interferon alpha and transfusion of viable donor buffy coat. All had complete hematologic and cytogenetic remission, which persisted 32 to 91 weeks after treatment. In two patients graft-versus-host disease developed and was treated by immunosuppression. These results are an example of adoptive immunotherapy without cytoreductive chemotherapy or radiotherapy in human chimeras. 
2	The vagus nerve, gastric secretions, and their relationship to peptic ulcer disease. Although peptic ulcer disease was known to the ancients, the process by which the disease was produced remained a mystery. As advances were made in medicine and science, so too were advances made in the understanding of digestion and gastrointestinal disease. The treatment of peptic ulcer disease improved as our understanding of the digestive process grew. The current surgical treatment for peptic ulcer disease follows the principals articulated by Lester R. Dragstedt, MD, PhD, which he based on his observations in the research laboratory. We present a historical perspective of the role of the vagus nerve in the control of gastric secretions and its relationship to peptic ulcer disease, placing particular emphasis on Dragstedt's contributions. 
5	The frequency, causes and timing of death within 30 days of a first stroke: the Oxfordshire Community Stroke Project. In a prospective, community-based study of 675 consecutive patients with a first-ever stroke, of whom over 90% had computed tomography (CT) and/or necropsy examinations, 129 deaths occurred within 30 days of the onset of symptoms, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 19%. The 30 day CFR for patients with cerebral infarction was 10% (57 of 545, for primary intracerebral haemorrhage 52% (34 of 66), for subarachnoid haemorrhage 45% (15 of 33) and for those of uncertain pathological type 74% (23 of 31). The CFR for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 33% compared with 17% for those who had been independent pre-stroke. The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was not significantly greater (1.8, 95% confidence interval 0 to 4.3). There was a significant trend for CFR to increase with age (Chi square for trend = 4.0, p less than 0.05). This relationship was found in those patients who had been functionally independent prestroke (Chi square for trend = 7.9, p less than 0.005) but not in those who had been dependent pre-stroke (Chi square for trend = 0.5, NS). The pattern of increasing CFR with increasing age amongst those who had been independent prestroke was seen particularly in patients with cerebral infarction (Chi square for trend = 8.6, p less than 0.005). The age-adjusted relative risk of death for patients with cerebral infarction who had been functionally dependent pre-stroke was 2.2 (95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.1). Fifty three percent of all deaths within 30 days of stroke were due to the direct neurological sequelae of the stroke. 
1	Correlates of survival and the Daumas-Duport grading system for astrocytomas. In order to examine the correlation between prognosis and the histological features of nuclear atypia, mitosis, endothelial proliferation, and necrosis in supratentorial adult astrocytomas, the authors reviewed 251 such cases treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1972 and 1980. One point was given for the presence of each feature. The total number of features was translated into a grade as follows: none of the four features = Grade 1 (one patient), one feature = Grade 2 (36 patients), two features = Grade 3 (33 patients), and three or four features = Grade 4 (181 patients). The period of survival was significantly associated with grade, the presence or absence of each of the four histological features, patient's age, type of operation, radiation therapy, and extent of tumor (log rank, p less than 0.05). The variables associated with grade were age (p less than 0.001) and radiation therapy (p less than 0.02). After adjustment for these variables using a Cox proportional-hazards model, the difference in overall survival time between patients in Grades 2 and 3 was not statistically significant. When comparable groups of patients were examined in terms of age or receipt of radiation therapy, the median survival times differed markedly. Patients 50 years of age or less had a median survival time of 68 months (Grade 2 tumors), 29 months (Grade 3 tumors), and 13 months (Grade 4 tumors). Patients over 50 years of age had a median survival time of 6 months (Grade 2 and 4 tumors) and 9 months (Grade 3 tumors). Those patients who had received radiation therapy had a median survival time of 68 months (Grade 2 tumors), 21 months (Grade 3 tumors), and 11 months (Grade 4 tumors). Those patients who did not receive radiation therapy had a median survival time of 1 month (Grade 2 tumors) and 2 months (Grade 3 and 4 tumors); over half of these patients died within 2 months of surgery. This grading system, originally proposed by Daumas-Duport, et al., is simple, objective, and reproducible, and correlates well with survival times. The authors recommend that astrocytomas be graded on a scale of 1 to 4, with Grade 1 reserved for the rare adult supratentorial astrocytoma with none of the four histological features. 
5	Chronic urticaria exacerbated by the antioxidant food preservatives, butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Two patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria in whom remissions were achieved with dye- and preservative-elimination diet had exacerbations of their urticaria when they were challenged under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions with butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene. After elimination of butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene from their diets, there was marked abatement of the frequency, severity, and duration of their urticaria. These antioxidants appear capable of aggravating symptoms in certain patients with chronic urticaria. 
4	Echocardiographic evaluation of patients with clinically suspected arterial emboli. 153 patients (mean age 42 years, range 16-60) who had arterial embolic events were examined prospectively by transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography. Patients older than 60 years and those with evidence of extracranial carotid artery occlusive disease were excluded. 84 patients had a cerebral ischaemic event, 50 patients had embolic events in an abdominal organ or limb, and 19 patients had acute retinal ischaemia. The transthoracic echocardiographic examination was normal in 92 patients (60%), whereas only 65 patients (42%) had normal findings after both transthoracic and transoesophageal examination (p less than 0.005). Intracardiac masses, including valvular vegetations, were found in 39 patients (25%), including 27% of patients with cerebral embolism and 32% of these with peripheral embolism, but in none of the patients with retinal ischaemia (p less than 0.001). 47 patients (31%) had valvular disease, 10 (7%) had wall motion abnormalities, 23 (15%) had abnormalities of the interatrial septum, and 9 patients (6%) had diseases of the thoracic aorta. Cardiovascular abnormalities were frequently found by echocardiography in patients with arterial emboli. The transesophageal technique significantly increased the chance of detecting such abnormalities, especially intracardiac masses. 
5	Characteristics of natural antibody responses to the circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium vivax. The antibody response to the prototype circumsporozoite (CS) protein of Plasmodium vivax (CSPV) was studied in Thai soldiers experiencing occupational malaria. Seventy-four (65%) of 114 men followed during assignment to a malaria transmission area developed blood-stage infection with P. vivax. IgG antibodies against the central repeat region of the CSPV protein were quantitated by ELISA using the recombinant protein, NS181V20, as the capture antigen. One quarter of the subjects had detectable anti-CSPV antibodies at the beginning of the study. CSPV antibody seroconversion was documented in 16 of 26 subjects assessed during their first observed episodes of vivax malaria. This antibody response was of moderate magnitude, fell off after the first week post-diagnosis and appeared, at the low levels observed, to be unassociated with protection. Continued assessment of anti-CSPV antibody after subjects left the transmission area found no increase associated with release of P. vivax. These findings indicate that CS antibody responses to P. vivax during occupational malaria share many characteristics with responses to P. falciparum. 
5	Timing of corticosteroid treatment. Effect of lung lymph dynamics in air injury in awake sheep. In paired experiments, we studied the effects of high-dose methylprednisolone on the acute pulmonary injury caused by 4 h of venous air embolization in 19 chronically instrumented, unanesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas. We compared the effect of methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg intravenous bolus) given before embolization, early (1 H) in the course of embolization, late (3 h) in the course of embolization, or after embolization (at the beginning of the recovery period). We measured pulmonary hemodynamics and lymph dynamics. In six sheep we also fixed lung tissue for semiquantitative histology, and in some we measured leukocyte concentrations in blood and in pulmonary lymph. Methylprednisolone did not significantly affect pulmonary hemodynamics but it largely prevented lung injury when it was given before embolization. It also lessened the degree of lung injury when it was given during embolization, although this effect became less marked as treatment was delayed. Methylprednisolone had no effect on lung injury when given after embolization was completed (4 h). We found fewer leukocytes attached to air emboli and fewer endothelial cell gaps in the lungs of sheep given methylprednisolone as prophylaxis. Leukocyte counts were lower in lung lymph and higher in the circulating blood of methylprednisolone-treated sheep. We conclude that methylprednisolone has a preventive effect on air embolism lung injury, such that its effect is greater when given earlier during the development of injury. 
4	Air embolism of the brain in rabbits pretreated with mechlorethamine. Infusion of 400 microliters air into the left internal carotid artery of five anesthetized rabbits caused transient pial arteriole air embolism, an immediate 41.9 +/- 0.8% dilatation of the embolized vessels, suppression of the cortical somatosensory evoked response to 29.4 +/- 2.7% of baseline, and a progressive decline in ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (measured by hydrogen clearance) to 46 +/- 4.1% of baseline after 2 hours. These values were significantly different from those at baseline and from the responses of 10 control rabbits given equivalent intracarotid saline infusions. Twelve other rabbits were made leukopenic by treatment with 1.5 mg/kg i.v. mechlorethamine 72 hours prior to study. Mean +/- SEM leukocyte count decreased from 6,320 +/- 73/mm3 to 1,890 +/- 66/mm3 without any change in the leukocyte differential or erythrocyte and platelet counts. Intracarotid infusion of saline into seven of the leukopenic rabbits caused no changes. In the other five leukopenic rabbits, infusion of 400 microliters air caused air embolism but did not produce the anticipated declines in cerebral blood flow or the cortical somatosensory evoked response, both of which remained indistinguishable from baseline values and responses in the seven saline-treated leukopenic controls. Similarly, air-embolized arterioles showed nonsignificant dilatation in leukopenic rabbits. Our data suggest that the decreases in both cerebral blood flow and brain function seen after air embolism require the presence of leukocytes. 
5	Pharmacological versus non-pharmacological prophylaxis of recurrent migraine headache: a meta-analytic review of clinical trials. In order to generate information about the relative effectiveness of the most widely used pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the prophylaxis of recurrent migraine (i.e., propranolol HCl and combined relaxation/thermal biofeedback training), meta-analysis was used to integrate results from 25 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of propranolol and 35 clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of relaxation/biofeedback training (2445 patients, collectively). Meta-analysis revealed substantial, but very similar improvements have been obtained with propranolol and with relaxation/biofeedback training. When daily recordings have been used to assess treatment outcome, both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have yielded a 43% reduction in migraine headache activity in the average patient. When improvements have been assessed using other outcome measures (e.g., physician/therapist ratings), improvements observed with each treatment have been about 20% greater. In both cases, improvements observed with propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback have been significantly larger than improvement observed with placebo medication (14% reduction) or in untreated patients (no reduction). Meta-analysis thus revealed substantial empirical support for the effectiveness of both propranolol and relaxation/biofeedback training, but revealed no support for the contention that the two treatments differ in effectiveness. These results suggest that greater attention should be paid to determining the relative costs and benefits of widely used pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. 
5	cAMP mediates IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration through endothelial monolayers. Endothelial cell incubated with IL-1 have been shown adhere more lymphocytes than nontreated endothelial cells. Here we demonstrate that IL-1 can also increase lymphocyte penetration through endothelial monolayers in vitro. IL-1 induced a transient increase in the number of lymphocytes penetrated through the endothelial monolayer into a filter in a time- and dose-dependent manner. This effect could be mimicked by increasing the cytosolic cAMP levels in the endothelial cells either by forskolin or dibutyryl-cAMP. Concomitantly we were able to show that IL-1 increased the cytosolic cAMP levels in endothelial cells. An inhibitor of adenylate cyclase, ddAdo, decreased both the IL-1-induced cAMP elevation and lymphocyte penetration. A protein kinase A inhibitor HA 1004 could inhibit the IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration, where as protein kinase C (N-(2-guamidino-ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesyl foamide hydrocloride) and calcium-calmodulin (N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalensulfanamide) inhibitors had no effect. Adding dibutyryl-cGMP or calcium ionophore to the endothelial cells could not mimic IL-1-induced penetration and finally IL-1 did not induce PKC translocation in endothelial cells. These data support the view that IL-1 acts via cAMP as a second messenger in regard to lymphocyte penetration through endothelial cells. The above data demonstrate that IL-1-induced lymphocyte penetration through endothelial cells and that this IL-1-induced signal is transduced via cAMP in endothelial cells. 
4	Differentiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Implantable devices capable of several modes of therapy will require differentiation of various ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Three methods of arrhythmia analysis, magnitude-squared coherence, ventricular rate, and irregularity of cycle length were performed for 45 episodes of induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia in 15 patients. Differentiation of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia from polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was possible by mean magnitude-squared coherence, less possible by rate, and not possible by beat-to-beat irregularity. Faster monomorphic ventricular tachycardia overlapped with rates of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Differentiation of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation was not possible by rate or irregularity. A progressive decrease in mean magnitude-squared coherence from monomorphic ventricular tachycardia to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia to ventricular fibrillation strengthens previous observations that coherence is a measure of rhythm "organization.". 
5	Muscle blood flow and muscle metabolism during exercise and heat stress. The effect of heat stress on blood flow and metabolism in an exercising leg was studied in seven subjects walking uphill (12-17%) at 5 km/h on a treadmill for 90 min or until exhaustion. The first 30 min of exercise were performed in a cool environment (18-21 degrees C); then subjects moved to an adjacent room at 40 degrees C and continued to exercise at the same speed and inclination for a further 60 min or to exhaustion, whichever occurred first. The rate of O2 consumption, 2.6 l/min (1.8-3.3) (average from cool and hot conditions), corresponded to 55-77% of their individual maximums. In the cool environment a steady state was reached at 30 min. When the subjects were shifted to the hot room, the core temperature and heart rate started to rise and reached values greater than 39 degrees C and near-maximal values, respectively, at the termination of the exercise. The leg blood flow (thermodilution method), femoral arteriovenous O2 difference, and consequently leg O2 consumption were unchanged in the hot compared with the cool condition. There was no increase in release of lactate and no reduction in glucose and free net fatty acid uptake in the exercising leg in the heat. Furthermore, the rate of glycogen utilization in the gastrocnemius muscle was not elevated in the hot environment. There was a tendency for cardiac output to increase in the heat (mean 15.2 to 18.4 l/min), which may have contributed to the increase in skin circulation, together with a possible further reduction in flow to other vascular beds, because muscle blood flow was not reduced. 
2	Requirement of endogenous tumor necrosis factor/cachectin for recovery from experimental peritonitis. By intrasplenic immunization we raised a rat mAb (mAb V1q; IgG2a, kappa) with a potent neutralizing activity against natural mouse TNF (1 microgram/ml mAb V1q/100 U/ml TNF). mAb V1q was used to study the role of endogenous TNF in experimental peritonitis induced by sublethal cecal ligation and puncture. mAb V1q persisted for over 5 days in the serum of mice injected with 100 micrograms of the antibody and, therefore, proved useful for in vivo experiments. As little as 20 micrograms mAb V1q/mouse prevented lethal shock of the animals by 400 micrograms LPS/mouse. In sublethal cecal ligation and puncture i.p. injection of mAb V1q directly and up to 8 h after induction of experimental peritonitis lead to death of the animals within 1 to 3 days. The lethal effect of mAb V1q was compensated by injection of recombinant mouse TNF. Similar mAb V1q effects as in immunocompetent mice were shown in severe combined immune deficiency mice deficient of mature functional B and T cells. Taken together, these data suggest that during the early phase of peritonitis endogenous TNF may stimulate nonlymphoid cells such as granulocytes, macrophages, platelets, and fibroblasts to ingest bacteria and to localize inflammation, respectively. These beneficial effects of TNF may determine survival. Thus, our data may have implications for the therapeutic management of a beginning peritonitis. 
4	Severe tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve repair: diagnosis by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Transesophageal echocardiography facilitates the evaluation of valvular repair in the operating room. The functional valvular morphology and degree of valvular regurgitation can be assessed before and after repair. This technique can also identify unsuspected findings--in this case, severe tricuspid regurgitation complicating cardiopulmonary bypass. We report a previously undescribed cause of traumatic tricuspid regurgitation. 
5	Near fatal subacute thallium poisoning necessitating prolonged mechanical ventilation. The authors describe a case of severe sensory-motor polyneuropathy caused by subacute thallium-intoxication rapidly progressing to respiratory failure due to complete muscle paralysis. After more than 2 months of mechanical ventilation, weaning from the ventilator was possible. Further intensive physical rehabilitation required an additional 6 months hospital stay, and 18 months later, neurological recovery was complete except for the distal lower limbs muscles. The authors discuss the different forms of thallotoxicosis and the present treatment is reviewed. Maximal prolonged therapeutic support should be offered in severe thallotoxicosis because of possible near complete recovery. 
2	Isoenzyme profiles of four strains of Giardia lamblia and their infectivity to jirds. The infectivity to jirds (Meriones unguiculatus) and the cyst excretion pattern of a recently isolated strain of Giardia lamblia from Egypt, Strain CDC:1088:1 (EGY), were compared to those of three well-established strains. All five jirds inoculated orally with strain UNO:0487:1 (UNO) became infected and began excreting cysts 3-6 days post-infection (dpi); no cysts were detected between 8-12 dpi after which time cysts were produced through day 19. Four of the five jirds infected with Strain ATCC:30957 (WB) and three of the five jirds infected with strain CDC:0284:1 (VA) excreted cysts from 6-20 dpi and 6-22 dpi, respectively. One of five jirds inoculated with EGY excreted cysts on 8 dpi only. At necropsy, trophozoites were recovered from only three UNO-infected jirds but from all WB- and VA-infected jirds that excreted cysts. The one jird which excreted cysts of EGY was negative at necropsy, but EGY trophozoites were found in one non-patient jird. Isoelectric focusing indicated that these four strains of G. lamblia represented three zymodemes. WB and VA were assigned to one zymodeme, EGY to a second, and UNO, which shared common bands with both other zymodemes, to the third. Although the similarities and differences in infectivity and cyst excretion patterns appear to coincide with the zymodemes to which the strains can be assigned, further study is needed to examine the parasitologic behavior of these strains in relation to isoenzyme patterns. 
1	Localization of basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA in melanocytic lesions by in situ hybridization. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a mitogen for normal human melanocytes and keratinocytes in culture. Experiments in vitro suggest that keratinocytes supply bFGF to melanocytes through a paracrine mechanism and that the aberrant expression of bFGF in melanomas confers growth independence from bFGF-producing cells. To determine whether bFGF is expressed in vivo, we examined a series of benign and malignant melanocytic lesions in situ using bFGF riboprobes on tissue sections, and correlated bFGF expression with histologic phenotype. Seventeen melanocytic neoplasms were studied, including four common acquired nevi, four dysplastic nevi, four primary malignant melanomas, and five metastatic melanomas. Nevic cells in benign intradermal nevi showed low signal intensity (1+), whereas compound and dysplastic nevi showed 2+ to 3+ expression in the junctional nevic cell population and 1+ expression in the dermal nevic cell population. Melanocytes in primary melanomas had intermediate (2+) and those in metastatic melanomas had low (1+) levels of bFGF gene transcripts. Fibroblasts expressed high levels (3+) and epidermal and adnexal keratinocytes moderate (2+) levels of bFGF in all cases studied. Basic FGF expression in endothelial cells, known to produce and respond to this growth factor in vitro, was lower than that in the fibroblast and keratinocyte cell population and, in 10 of 17 cases, no bFGF mRNA was detectable. This study shows that bFGF is expressed in nevomelanocytes in vivo in all melanocytic lesions studied and thus cannot be used as a marker for transformation. The presence of bFGF gene transcripts in the various dermal cell types and in keratinocytes suggests that it may act as an autocrine and paracrine growth factor in regulating cellular proliferation in the skin. 
4	Risk of myocardial infarction and death during treatment with low dose aspirin and intravenous heparin in men with unstable coronary artery disease. The RISC Group 796 men with unstable coronary artery disease (unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction [MI] ), were randomised to double-blind placebo-controlled treatment with oral aspirin 75 mg/day and/or 5 days of intermittent intravenous heparin. The risk of MI and death was reduced by aspirin. After 5 days the risk ratio was 0.43 (confidence intervals, 0.21-0.91), at 1 month 0.31 (0.18-0.53), and at 3 months 0.36 (0.23-0.57). Aspirin reduced event rate in non-Q-wave MI and unstable angina, independently of electrocardiographic abnormalities or concurrent drug therapy. Heparin had no significant influence on event rate, although the group treated with aspirin and heparin had the lowest number of events during the initial 5 days. Treatment had few side-effects and high patient compliance. 
4	Salt and hypertension. Lessons from animal models that relate to human hypertension. A high NaCl diet can raise blood pressure in both susceptible people and in susceptible animals, and the mechanisms are probably quite similar for both humans and animals. The possibly harmful effects of a high NaCl diet are not unexpected since both prehistoric man and mammals evolved in a low NaCl world. Evolutionary forces molded mammals to adapt well to a low sodium intake; the modern high NaCl intake goes "against the grain" of this adaptation. The high NaCl diet can cause premature mortality by raising blood pressure in susceptible people. We have new evidence that in a hypertensive setting, a high NaCl diet can increase mortality even though it does not cause a further rise of blood pressure. Multiple small cerebral infarcts are a partial cause of this excess mortality. Recent evidence also indicates that a high potassium diet reduces the rise of blood pressure caused by a high NaCl diet, whereas a low normal potassium intake encourages an NaCl-induced rise of blood pressure. It is the combination of kidneys that tends to retain NaCl together with a high NaCl intake that produces a rise in blood pressure. This combination tends to cause NaCl retention, which can trigger a rise in blood pressure in susceptible humans and animals. Such a rise in blood pressure can augment renal NaCl excretion and regain the previous NaCl balance. In the Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rat, there are several renal abnormalities that would tend to encourage sodium retention. By analogy, renal "abnormalities" are probably present in people susceptible to hypertension. 
3	Increased MEPP frequency as an early sign of experimental immune-mediated motoneuron disease. Intracellular recordings of miniature end-plate potentials were performed in extensor digitorum longus muscles from guinea pigs with experimental immune-mediated motoneuron destruction. In the early stages of the disease, the miniature end-plate potential frequency was elevated compared to that in control and normal animals. The amplitude and time course of the miniature end-plate potentials as well as the resting potential of the muscle fibers were not altered, which implies integrity of the postjunctional membrane. The increase in frequency of miniature end-plate potential reflects an increase of basal acetylcholine release and documents dysfunction of the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction. The increased frequency was associated with high levels of antimotoneuronal IgG in the blood and the presence of IgG at motor end-plates. These data suggest that the presynaptic terminal of the neuromuscular junction may be involved in the immune attack in animal models of motoneuron degeneration. 
4	Thromboexclusion of the right ventricle in children with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum. Twelve children with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum underwent closure of the tricuspid valve as a part of a new surgical procedure. In two cases a concomitant Fontan operation was performed. In each patient the right ventricle was very small and right ventricular pressure was higher than systemic pressure. Ventricle-coronary connections provided flow of desaturated blood from the right ventricle into the coronary arteries in 11 of 12 cases. Five of the 12 children did not survive operation and postmortem examination of each revealed severe acute and chronic myocardial ischemic damage and high-grade obstruction or interruption of the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Preoperative angiography demonstrated occlusive changes in the coronary arteries, resulting in right ventricular dependent circulation, in all five children who died and in one child who survived operation. Seven children who survived operation are well 4 months to 3.5 years later. Two have undergone subsequent successful Fontan operation and two others are considered suitable candidates for this operation. Tricuspid valve closure is recommended for a carefully selected group of infants with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum provided a right ventricular-dependent coronary circulation can be excluded on the basis of preoperative coronary cineangiography. 
4	Irrigation device for neuroangiographic procedures. A simple irrigation device for use in diagnostic and interventional neuroangiographic procedures is described. The device is used to flush bubbles and blood clots from catheter hubs. The authors also describe a technique in which this device can be used to prevent filling a catheter with air when a guide wire is removed. 
4	Lower extremity percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: multifactorial analysis of morbidity and mortality. We analyzed the outcome of 202 percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) procedures performed between 1983 and 1989 to quantitate procedural risks and define factors associated with suboptimal results or immediate clinical failure. Premorbid factors studied included age, sex, treatment of single versus multiple lesions, stenoses versus occlusions, premorbid status of the limb (claudication vs limb threat), and most distal level of PTA. Adverse outcomes included complications (hematoma, acute occlusion, or thrombosis of PTA site, distal embolization, failure to dilate or cross, arterial dissection, rupture, and significant systemic derangement), major amputations (below knee and above knee), and deaths. There were 66 complications (32.7%), 22 amputations (10.9%), and 12 deaths (5.9%) in our series. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the major predictive variable for the occurrence of a complication (p = 0.002), and the only predictive variable for the outcomes of amputation and death (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.0139, respectively), was the premorbid clinical status of the limb. Lower extremity PTA is not an intrinsically benign procedure and is associated with a significant risk of complication, amputation, and procedure-associated death. These adverse outcomes cluster in patients with limb threat. Therefore it may be reasonable to restrict the use of PTA to patients with claudication and strictly selected cases of limb threat. 
4	The population mean predicts the number of deviant individuals OBJECTIVE--To examine the relation between the prevalence of deviation and the mean for the whole population in characteristics such as blood pressure and consumption of alcohol. DESIGN--Re-examination of standardised data from the Intersalt study, an international, multicentre study on the determinants of blood pressure. SETTING AND SUBJECTS--Samples of adults representing 52 populations in 32 countries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--The relations, expressed as correlation coefficients, between the mean population values for blood pressure, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and sodium intake and the prevalence of, respectively, hypertension (greater than or equal to 140 mm Hg), obesity (body mass index greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2), high alcohol intake (greater than or equal to 300 ml/week), and high sodium intake (greater than or equal to 250 mmol/day). RESULTS--There were close and independent associations between the population mean and the prevalence of deviance for each of the variables examined: correlation coefficients were 0.85 for blood pressure, 0.94 for body mass index, 0.97 for alcohol intake, and 0.78 for sodium intake. CONCLUSIONS--These findings imply that distributions of health related characteristics move up and down as a whole: the frequency of "cases" can be understood only in the context of a population's characteristics. The population thus carries a collective responsibility for its own health and well being, including that of its deviants. 
1	The effects of nonthyroid disease and drugs on thyroid function tests. Serious nonthyroid illness and caloric deprivation, which so often accompany systemic illness, have diverse and still incompletely understood effects on thyroid hormone economy. We have discussed the pathophysiologic basis for the most common pattern of alterations in routine thyroid function tests: a decreased serum T3 concentration; normal or, in critically ill patients, a low total serum T4 level; and a normal free T4 concentration. Another, less frequent pattern (high total and free T4 with a normal serum T3) can be encountered transiently in the acutely ill medical or psychiatric patient. With the recent advent of sensitive assays for TSH and better methods for serum free T4, it is now possible to define more quickly and accurately the thyroid-metabolic status of most of these sick patients; the vast majority are euthyroid. Certain drugs confound the picture. The most important of these include dopamine and high-dose glucocorticoids, both of which suppress TSH secretion from the pituitary and may actually cause a state of central hypothyroidism. Other drugs have multiple effects on thyroid hormone indices (e.g., amiodarone). Knowledge of all of the ways in which systemic illness, starvation, and certain drugs may influence thyroid function tests is crucial in assessing the thyroid status of patients with serious nonthyroid disease. 
2	Biliary cholesterol transport and precipitation: introduction and overview of conference. Cholesterol is secreted into bile as cholesterol-phospholipid vesicles. The cholesterol and phospholipid are subsequently exposed to the bile salts contained in the bile, which leads to the process of micellation. Two situations may arise depending on whether there is enough bile salt in proportion to cholesterol to complete this "maturation" process. If the cholesterol saturation is low, at equilibrium the bile salts will have completely micellized the vesicles. On the other hand, if bile is saturated with cholesterol, the micellation process is incomplete and vesicles and micelles will be present at equilibrium. The residual vesicle in this latter situation may have a higher cholesterol/phospholipid ratio because of the greater propensity of phospholipid to be micellized. This situation may result in cholesterol nucleation. The mechanism of nucleation from vesicles and the possible role of nucleating and antinucleating proteins in this process have been discussed. 
5	Late arterial hemorrhage secondary to a Greenfield filter requiring operative intervention. Retroperitoneal hematomas associated with Greenfield filters have been described and are generally characterized as clinically insignificant. We report a retroperitoneal hematoma that was associated with a Greenfield filter and that required operative intervention because of hemodynamic instability. At operation a lumbar arterial laceration apparently caused by a protruding filter prong was identified and ligated. The implications of this occurrence for filter placement indications are discussed. The potential life-threatening severity of filter-associated hematomas is emphasized. 
1	A critical review of chemical lymph node clearance and staging of colon and rectal cancer at Ferguson Hospital, 1977 to 1982 A unique opportunity to evaluate the method of chemical lymph node clearance for colorectal cancer exists at Ferguson Hospital. Lymph node clearance has been used at the institution since 1977, and this retrospective analysis was undertaken to ascertain its validity there. Furthermore, the node positive group was evaluated to ascertain if the current staging system (Turnbull, 1967) is prognostically accurate for the Dukes' C group. Specifically evaluated for possible prognostic variance was the survival of those patients whose tumors demonstrated partial bowel wall penetration and only one to four positive nodes, a "C1 subset," previously reported to have favorable prognosis. Eight hundred sixty-four cases of colon and rectal cancer treated surgically from 1977 to 1982 were analyzed. There was a mean of 27 lymph nodes retrieved per specimen and a mean of 4.5 positive nodes per Dukes' C specimen. There were 43 C1 and 201 C2 cases with five-year survival rates of 73 and 38 percent, respectively. The results of chemical clearance at Ferguson Hospital were found to be comparable with that of other centers using chemical clearance and superior to hand dissection. The C1 subset clearly is noted to have prognostic advantage and should occupy a separate designation in any staging system. 
1	Systemic preoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin, methotrexate and vinblastine for locally advanced bladder cancer: local tumor response and early followup results. A total of 44 patients with infiltrating, locally advanced bladder cancer (stages T 3a-b, T 4a-b and N+/N0) were treated with the systemic chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin, methotrexate and vinblastine (CMV) in the neoadjuvant setting, of whom 39 were evaluable for response. After planned radical cystectomy and 2 to 3 cycles of chemotherapy no tumor was found on the pathological specimen of 4 patients (10%), the tumor was downstaged in 19 (49%) and no change was observed in 16 (41%). Toxicity included leukopenia in 29 patients (66%), 1 of whom died of granulocytopenic sepsis, nausea and vomiting in 39 (89%) and mild to moderate mucositis in 18 (41%). Median followup is 12 months with a range of 6 to 39 months. Of 32 patients followed for longer than 6 months 6 (19%) experienced progression or recurrence of disease. We conclude that preoperative CMV chemotherapy is effective in inducing downstaging of the tumor, although systemic toxicity limits its use to cautiously selected patients. 
4	What is the best method for assessing the long-term outcome of surgery for accessory pathways and atrioventricular junctional reentrant tachycardias? The success of surgery for supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is evaluated by a variety of methods in different hospitals. Unfortunately, the predictive values of these methods are not known. We therefore compared the various methods in 261 patients undergoing surgery for SVT at Westmead Hospital since 1981. Surgical outcome was assessed by early tests during the first week after surgery (serial 12-lead electrocardiograms, telemetric monitoring of the electrocardiogram, and electrophysiological study performed using epicardial wires); later tests at 6 months after surgery (12-lead electrocardiograms and electrophysiological study); and symptomatic review done by telephone interview at a median of 34 months after surgery. Early tests were obtained in 97%, later tests were obtained in 76%, and symptomatic review was obtained in 98% of patients. All of the examined tests were inaccurate methods of surgical assessment compared with the late electrophysiological study. A large proportion of the patients proven to be surgical failures at the late electrophysiological study were not detected by early tests (83%), by later electrocardiograms (66%), or by symptomatic assessment (41%). Accurate assessment of surgical outcome requires a late electrophysiological study to permit comparison of surgical techniques. Late electrophysiological study also provides accurate information on the current risks and benefits of proposed surgery for communication to patients to enable them to make an informed decision on future treatment. Most patients are willing to have a late electrophysiological study and usually benefit from clarification of their true surgical outcome. 
5	Pyoderma gangrenosum complicating Felty's syndrome. The case of a 54-year-old woman with Felty's syndrome whose course was complicated by mucocutaneous lesions clinically typical of pyoderma gangrenosum is described. Necrotizing sinusitis and saddle nose deformity were distinctive clinical features. Lymphocytic vasculitis and rheumatoid nodule formation observed within panniculus at the base of a cutaneous lesion and in a nasal mucosal lesion were unexpected histopathologic findings. 
5	Pathogenesis of ischemic necrosis in random-pattern skin flaps induced by long-term low-dose nicotine treatment in the rat. The objectives of the present experiments were to study the effects of long-term low-dose nicotine treatment on skin hemodynamics, viability, and microvascular morphology in 4 x 10 cm dorsally based acute random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. In addition, the reversibility of the nicotine-induced detrimental effects on skin-flap viability following cessation of nicotine treatment also was investigated. Low-dose nicotine (0.6 mg/kg) administered twice daily and subcutaneously for 24 weeks significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased skin-flap capillary blood flow, distal perfusion, and length and area of skin viability compared with the saline-treated control (n = 15). However, these same parameters in rats (n = 15) whose nicotine treatment had been withheld for 2 weeks prior to skin-flap surgery were not significantly different from the control, thus indicating that the detrimental effects of this long-term, low-dose nicotine treatment were reversible. The mean plasma level of nicotine in the nicotine-treated rats was 8.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl and was within the range of plasma nicotine levels reported for human heavy cigarette smokers. Light and electron microscopic studies did not show evidence of histologic damage to the cutaneous microvasculature in acute random-pattern skin flaps and samples of normal (nonoperated) skin in nicotine-treated rats. It is concluded that long-term plasma levels of nicotine similar to those of heavy cigarette smokers are detrimental to the capillary blood flow and viability of random-pattern skin flaps in the rat. These deleterious effects can be avoided if skin flaps are raised 2 weeks after cessation of nicotine treatment. This low-dose nicotine treatment does not cause histologic damage to the microvasculature. Other pathogenic mechanisms of nicotine-induced skin flap ischemia are discussed. 
2	Unsuspected syphilitic hepatitis in a patient with low-grade proteinuria and abnormal liver function A 25-year-old patient was found to have cholestatic liver enzyme abnormalities during assessment for asymptomatic low-grade proteinuria at the US Naval Hospital in Portsmouth, Virginia. These abnormalities persisted for a 6-month period, and an extensive workup, including viral serologic studies, rapid plasma reagin test, iron studies, ceruloplasmin, antimitochondrial, antinuclear, and anti-human immunodeficiency virus antibodies, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and liver biopsy, was unrevealing until serologic tests for syphilis were repeated to evaluate a new onset of urethral discharge. The patient had none of the more characteristic signs of secondary syphilis. The liver enzyme abnormalities rapidly resolved after treatment with penicillin. Syphilis remains the great impostor and still must be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained liver enzyme abnormalities, even in a patient with no symptoms or signs of early syphilis. 
5	Course of diabetic retinopathy following cataract surgery Five patients with mild to moderate retinopathy to both eyes underwent complication-free cataract surgery in one eye. Within three months of surgery deterioration of the retinopathy was observed in the operated eye only. In four patients there was an increase of intraretinal haemorrhages and hard exudates, accompanied by clinically significant macular oedema manifested as retinal thickening and extensive fluorescein leakage from both the macular and the peripapillary capillary networks. Of these four patients one also developed retinal ischaemia, evident ophthalmoscopically by flame-shaped haemorrhages and cotton-wool spots and angiographically by areas of capillary non-perfusion. The fifth patient showed proliferation of new blood vessels and vitreous haemorrhage. Diabetic patients scheduled for cataract surgery should undergo a thorough preoperative evaluation of any existing retinopathy. Postoperatively they should be followed up at close intervals so that any progression of retinopathy can be promptly detected and considered for laser treatment. 
5	L-tryptophan use and the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. We present a case of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in a patient taking large doses of L-tryptophan for sedation. He developed the now-classic findings of myalgias, skin changes, and marked eosinophilia. This syndrome was first recognized in late 1989, and epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an association of the clinical syndrome with ingestion of L-tryptophan. The mechanism of toxicity remains unknown. Casual use of L-tryptophan has been diminished by its rapid removal from the nutrition counter of health food stores. 
3	Graves orbitopathy: correlation of CT and clinical findings. The clinical and high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) findings in 71 patients (142 orbits) with Graves orbitopathy and 20 healthy patients (40 orbits) were retrospectively reviewed. The orbits with orbitopathy were subgrouped at clinical examination into those with (n = 18) and those without (n = 124) optic neuropathy. Mean extraocular muscle diameters and the calculated muscle diameter index were significantly increased in all orbits with ophthalmopathy, particularly in those with optic neuropathy. Graves orbitopathy affected the superior muscle group (63.4%) more than the medial (61.3%) or inferior (57%) recti. The most common pattern of muscle involvement involved all five measured extraocular muscles. Solitary muscle involvement most frequently involved the superior muscle group (6.3%). Significant enlargements of the retrobulbar optic nerve sheath and superior ophthalmic vein were noted only in orbits with optic neuropathy. Anterior displacement of the lacrimal gland at CT correlated with clinical palpability and occurred more frequently in patients with optic neuropathy. Severe apical crowding was the most sensitive indication of optic neuropathy at CT. 
3	Response to suxamethonium in a myasthenic patient during remission. A cumulative dose followed by an infusion was used to determine the dose response to suxamethonium in a patient with diagnosed myasthenia gravis who was in true remission (asymptomatic while receiving no therapy). The ED50 and ED90 values for suxamethonium were 0.08 mg/kg and 0.20 mg/kg, and an infusion rate of 3.2 mg/kg/hour was required to maintain a 90-95% depression of the single twitch response as monitored by integrated electromyography. These values are within the range for normal patients, and we conclude that myasthenic patients during a true remission may not demonstrate resistance to suxamethonium. 
5	Intraoperative coronary angiography using fluorescein. Intraoperative coronary angiography using fluorescein was applied to evaluate the patency of saphenous vein grafts just after completion of the distal anastomosis. By this technique, the area of the revascularized myocardium was well estimated in real time. This intraoperative direct-vision examination gives us more timely and precise information during coronary artery bypass grafting. 
1	Osteosarcoma of the spermatic cord. Malignant tumors of the spermatic cord are rare but the vast majority of these tumors are sarcomas. We report on a patient with osteosarcoma arising in the spermatic cord. Left radical orchiectomy with high dissection of the spermatic cord was performed, and the patient remains free of recurrence 2 years postoperatively. We could find no previous discussion or report of this tumor. 
4	Myocardial uptake of indium-111-labeled antimyosin in acute subendocardial infarction: clinical, histochemical, and autoradiographic correlation of myocardial necrosis. Indium-111-labeled antimyosin has been utilized in the diagnosis and localization of acute transmural myocardial infarction. The present report describes a patient who presented with a massive subendocardial infarction. Two days after the injection of antimyosin, the patient's clinical status markedly deteriorated and he expired. Postmortem examination demonstrated severe three-vessel coronary artery disease with extensive myocyte death in the endocardium. Autoradiography and histochemical staining of the prosected heart demonstrated high correlation for myocardial necrosis and corresponded to clinical evidence for diffuse subendocardial infarction. 
3	Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging in Leigh disease. An infant with Leigh disease, who was the younger sister of a similarly affected infant, had been examined before the onset of the disease. Ultrasonography revealed hyperechoic lesions in the putamen and caudate nucleus during the preclinical stage. At onset, these changes extended into the cerebral cortex and medulla. These lesions were also detected by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as areas of increased signal intensity. Her brother demonstrated the same ultrasonographic results; cranial computed tomography disclosed low-density areas in the basal ganglia which were detected as hyperechoic lesions by ultrasonography. These findings suggest that ultrasonography is useful in detecting early intracranial lesions in Leigh disease. 
2	Variants of intestinal metaplasia in the evolution of chronic atrophic gastritis and gastric ulcer. A follow up study. A follow up study with biopsy was initiated in 1982 to define the relations between variants of intestinal metaplasia and the evolution of chronic atrophic gastritis and gastric ulcer. All patients (58 with chronic atrophic gastritis and 66 with gastric ulcer) had intestinal metaplasia at the start of the study. In the six year period to 1988 a total of 241 biopsies were performed on the patients with chronic atrophic gastritis and 243 on the patients with gastric ulcer. Initially, 81% of the patients with chronic atrophic gastritis presented with type I intestinal metaplasia and 14% with type III intestinal metaplasia. During follow up type I was predominant, often associated with grades 2 and 3 active disease (81%) and 45% of these patients reverted to a non-intestinal metaplasia status by the third year of follow up. In contrast, type III metaplasia was more common in the absence of appreciable inflammation (78% of biopsy specimens), being persistent in five of seven patients in the third year of follow up, and was found to be associated with dysplasia in three of these patients. Similarly, the initial biopsy specimen showed type I metaplasia in most patients with gastric ulcer (82%) and type III in only 4%. Type I metaplasia was also predominant in these patients (80%), particularly in active disease (68%), gradually regressing with healing. In contrast, type III was associated with delayed ulcer healing and reactivation (75%; six of eight patients). 
4	Sudden cardiac death while wearing a Holter monitor. The Holter tapes of 61 patients (46 men, mean age +/- standard deviation 65 +/- 11 years) with sudden cardiac death while being monitored were analyzed. Thirty-eight patients were known to have coronary artery disease, 5 had cardiomyopathy, and 7 had aortic valve disease. Etiology remained unknown in 11 patients. Mean New York Heart Association functional class was 2.5 +/- 0.7. Thirty patients had received antiarrhythmic drugs and 32 had received digitalis. Sudden death occurred at rest in 73%. In the hours before death, repetitive ventricular arrhythmias were found in 50 patients (82%), with atrial fibrillation in 34%. Patients with bradyarrhythmic death (18%) had less complex ventricular activity compared to patients with tachyarrhythmic death (p less than 0.01). Lethal arrhythmias--monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, primary ventricular fibrillation, and 1:1 conducting atrial tachycardia--were found in 26 (43%), 15 (25%), 5 (8%), 3 (5%), and 1 patient, respectively. The coupling interval of the final ventricular tachycardia correlated inversely with the initial frequency of ventricular tachycardia (p less than 0.05). For patients with tachyarrhythmic death, an increase of heart rate within the last 3 hours was noted (83 vs 89 beats/min, p less than 0.05). Ventricular premature complexes and the proportion of patients with greater than 2 couplets and greater than 2 triplets increased significantly only within the last hour before death. 
4	Entrapment of a folded-over introducer sheath in the iliofemoral artery: an unusual complication of PTCA guiding catheter exchange An arterial introducer sheath became folded over in the iliac artery during PTCA. This probably resulted from withdrawal of a doubled over Judkins left coronary guiding catheter through the introducer sheath. Nonsurgical, atraumatic removal was accomplished after the acute bend of the introducer sheath had been withdrawn to the site of arterial entrance. 
3	Synchronous Hodgkin's disease and myelofibrosis terminating with granulocytic sarcoma and acute megakaryocytic leukemia. Our patient had stage IIIAI Hodgkin's disease with synchronous myelofibrosis and myeloid metaplasia. A slowly progressive myeloproliferative disease developed over 9 1/2 years and terminated in a painful osteolytic bone disease, spinal extradural granulocytic sarcoma and acute megakaryocytic leukemia. It is likely that this was a result of the myeloproliferative disease rather than a late complication from combination chemotherapy. Our case demonstrates the importance of a curative approach to Hodgkin's disease even in the face of a coexistent disease with a long or unknown natural history. 
5	An overview of intimal hyperplasia. Many hypotheses have been postulated for the development of intimal hyperplasia in vein and prosthetic grafts. In these hypotheses, the central theme seems to be endothelial injury, but not always denuding injury. As we progress into the biologic era with more sophisticated research tools, the study of the endothelial cell may give us the answers to the problem of intimal hyperplasia. In addition, the leukocyte is still a relatively unknown entity and further modification of their function may hold promise. 
3	Abdominal wall pain: an alternative diagnosis. The cause of abdominal pain need not necessarily reside in the viscera; the abdominal wall is another source of symptoms. Some causes of abdominal wall pain are obvious, e.g. hernias, but not so others such as nerve entrapment syndromes. This review is concerned with causes of abdominal wall pain which, although common, may be easily overlooked. 
3	Time of rehabilitation admission and severity of trauma: effect on brain injury outcome. Outcome after traumatic brain injury, defined by the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) and length of stay in acute rehabilitation, was measured in 59 patients admitted to an intensive rehabilitation program to examine the effects of severity of the initial brain injury, severity of multiple trauma, and length of stay in the acute care hospital. Severity of initial brain injury, best measured by length of coma, was the most significant predictor of GOS outcome. Length of acute hospitalization was a small, but significant, predictor of GOS. Severity of initial brain injury, length of acute hospitalization, and gender emerged as predictors of length of rehabilitation hospital stay. Although length of acute hospitalization is apparently affected by severity of brain injury, it adds significantly--more than severity of brain injury--to the prediction of length of rehabilitation. 
4	Rapid baroreceptor resetting in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Dahl salt-sensitive rats rapidly become hypertensive when exposed to a high salt diet, but Dahl salt-resistant rats maintain normal blood pressure on a high salt diet. A defect in baroreceptor afferents is thought to play a key role in the low sensitivity of baroreceptor reflexes in Dahl salt-sensitive rats even in the prehypertensive stage during low salt treatment. In the present study, we tested whether differences in rapid resetting ability might contribute to differences in baroreceptor function in Dahl rats. Four groups of rats were tested: salt-sensitive and salt-resistant rats on low salt and high salt diets (0.15% and 8.0% NaCl). We compared the rapidly resetting responses of baroreceptors from each group using an in vitro preparation. Rapid resetting was assessed for each aortic baroreceptor (n = 46) by linear fit of the relation of pressure threshold and conditioning mean arterial pressure. Each group had a wide range of resetting ratios (the slope of the resetting relation). Despite higher initial pressure thresholds in salt-sensitive rats on a high salt diet, resetting ratios among the four groups were similar. Thus, the ability of Dahl salt-sensitive baroreceptors to rapidly reset is preserved, despite high dietary salt and a genetic predisposition to dysfunction. The present findings in Dahl rats reinforce the results of recent studies of rapid resetting during spontaneous and renal hypertension, which suggests that the rapid resetting process is remarkably resistant to factors that compromise baroreceptor function. 
1	Expression of laminin and its receptor LBP-32 in human and rat hepatoma cells. Dramatic cellular changes that occur during hepatocarcinogenesis are associated with major alterations in extracellular matrix formation and in the relationships between cells and their microenvironment. We have studied the expression of laminin, the major noncollagenous glycoprotein of basement membrane, and the laminin receptor 32 kD laminin-binding protein in two rat (Faza 967 and HTC) and two human (HepG2 and HBGC2) hepatoma cell lines that express a variety of liver-specific functions. Laminin was found in the rough endoplasmic reticulum of these cells when the indirect immunoperoxidase method and electron microscopic examination were used. Radiolabeled laminin, immunoprecipitated from both media and cell extracts, was resolved by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel in two major polypeptides that comigrated with the A and B subunits from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor laminin. Immunoblot analysis showed that the Mr = 400,000 polypeptide did not correspond to the A subunit of laminin. Northern blot analyses demonstrated large amounts of B1 and B2 mRNAs but no A chain mRNA. We conclude that the tumor cells produce the laminin B chains only. In contrast, normal adult hepatocytes from either man or rat lacked laminin mRNAs, whereas in 1-day primary culture, B chain mRNAs became detectable. The steady-state level of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNA was 10-fold and threefold higher in rat hepatoma cells than in freshly isolated and 1-day cultured normal rat hepatocytes, respectively. In human hepatocytes, the steady-state levels of 32 kD laminin-binding protein mRNAs varied depending on the donor and never reached the level of the human hepatoma cells. 
1	Trends in basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma of the skin from 1973 through 1987. Major increases have occurred in the incidence of basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, as well as in cutaneous malignant melanoma during the period 1973 through 1987 in British Columbia. The greatest increases in basal and squamous cell carcinomas are on the head and neck. This indicates that exposure to sunlight is the major causative factor. The greatest increase in melanoma is on the trunk in men and on the lower limbs in women. The dramatic increases in nonmelanoma skin cancers in British Columbia, a relatively low sunlight area, suggest that major prevention programs are needed in areas that are not considered "sunspots.". 
1	Malignant melanoma occurring during pregnancy: a report of the Northern Israel Oncology Center (1968-1988). Medical records of seven patients treated within a 20 year period for malignant melanoma during pregnancy were reviewed. No significant detrimental prognostic effects could be attributed to pregnancy. The current literature on melanoma and pregnancy is discussed. Based on this, pregnancy seems not to be contraindicated in melanoma patients. 
2	Caseating hepatic granulomas in Hodgkin's lymphoma. A 68-year-old man presented with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma after a 9-year disease-free interval induced by chemotherapy. In addition to histological evidence of recurrent Hodgkin's disease, the liver biopsy specimen showed extensive caseating granulomas. Cultures of bone marrow and liver tissue tested negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. No antituberculous treatment was administered, and the patient had an excellent clinical response to additional chemotherapy for lymphoma. Hodgkin's lymphoma should be added to the list of disease entities associated with caseating granulomas in the liver. 
1	Motility factor produced by malignant glioma cells: role in tumor invasion. To better understand the cellular mechanism of tumor invasion, the production of a cell motility-stimulating factor by malignant glioma cells was studied in vitro. Serum-free conditioned media from cultures of rat C6 and human T98G cell lines contained a factor that stimulated the locomotion of the producer cells. This factor was termed the "glioma-derived motility factor." The glioma-derived motility factor is a heat-labile protein with a molecular weight greater than 10 kD and has relative stability to acid. The factor showed not only chemotactic activity but also chemokinetic (stimulated random locomotion) activity in the two types of glioma cells studied. Although glioma-derived motility factors in conditioned media obtained from two different cell origins are likely to be the same, chemokinetic migration of T98G cells to their conditioned medium was much stronger than that of C6 cells to theirs. Coincubation of cells with cytochalasin B, which disrupts the assembly of cellular actin microfilaments, almost completely inhibited the cell migration stimulated by glioma-derived motility factor. Cytochalasin B also induced marked alterations in cell morphology, including cell retraction and arborization, while the drug did not affect cell attachment to culture dishes. These results indicate that glioma cells produce a motility factor which may play a role particularly when tumor cells are detached and migrate away from the original tumor mass, thus promoting tumor invasion. Also, glioma cell migration stimulated by the motility factor requires the normal organization of cytoskeletons such as actin microfilaments. 
4	Usefulness of tomographic thallium-201 imaging for detection of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The role of tomographic thallium-201 exercise and redistribution imaging in the detection of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was evaluated in 116 patients: 61 (53%) with 1- and 55 (47%) with multivessel PTCA, with a total of 185 dilated vessels. Complete revascularization was performed in 89 (77%) and partial revascularization in 27 (23%) of the patients. Restenosis was angiographically demonstrated in 69 (60%) of the patients and 85 (46%) of the vessels 6.4 +/- 3.1 months after PTCA. Disease progression in previously normal vessels was noted in 11 patients. The results were: (1) for detection of restenosis in the group of patients, single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) versus exercise electrocardiographic sensitivity was 93 vs 52% (p less than 0.001), specificity 77 vs 64%, and accuracy 86 vs 57% (p less than 0.001). The results were similar in the complete and partial revascularization groups. (2) SPECT was 86% sensitive, specific and accurate for restenosis detection in specific vessels with comparable results for 1-versus multivessel PTCA and complete versus partial revascularization. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were: 89, 95 and 92% for the left anterior descending coronary artery; 88, 79 and 82% for the right coronary artery; and 76, 83 and 85% for the left circumflex coronary artery. Eighty-one percent of the diseased nondilated vessels were correctly identified. (3) Disease progression to greater than 50% stenosis was detected with 91% sensitivity, 84% specificity and 85% accuracy. SPECT thallium-201 imaging is an excellent tool for the detection of restenosis and disease progression after PTCA in the settings of 1- and multivessel angioplasty and complete and partial revascularization. 
4	Cardiovascular disease risk profiles. This article presents prediction equations for several cardiovascular disease endpoints, which are based on measurements of several known risk factors. Subjects (n = 5573) were original and offspring subjects in the Framingham Heart Study, aged 30 to 74 years, and initially free of cardiovascular disease. Equations to predict risk for the following were developed: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease (CHD), death from CHD, stroke, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular disease. The equations demonstrated the potential importance of controlling multiple risk factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, glucose intolerance, and left ventricular hypertrophy) as opposed to focusing on one single risk factor. The parametric model used was seen to have several advantages over existing standard regression models. Unlike logistic regression, it can provide predictions for different lengths of time, and probabilities can be expressed in a more straightforward way than the Cox proportional hazards model. 
1	Synchronous diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma presenting as splenomegaly and iron deficiency anemia. Diffuse well-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (D-WDLL) and chronic lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) represent closely related neoplasms which may have indolent courses. Dating back more than one century, reports of associated second primary malignancies continue to intrigue clinicians. A case of synchronous D-WDLL and gastric adenocarcinoma, presenting as splenomegaly and iron deficiency anemia, is presented. The case and literature are reviewed. 
3	Prevalence and characteristics of multiple analgesic drug use in an elderly study group. With few exceptions, use of multiple analgesic drugs achieves dubious increases in analgesia while placing elders at increased risk of the many potential adverse effects of analgesic drugs. The potential for duplication of analgesic therapy among the elderly is great due to prevalent painful chronic conditions and the variety of prescription and nonprescription analgesic remedies available. The prevalence of multiple analgesic product use and patterns of concurrent use of different analgesic categories was investigated in a geographically defined population of persons 65 years of age and older. The demographic characteristics of users of multiple analgesic drug products were examined, as were their smoking status, alcohol use, lifetime history rates of major illnesses, physical functioning, pain experiences, memory performance, and depressive symptoms. A substantial proportion of analgesic users reported taking multiple products in the preceding 2 weeks (14.4% of female and 10.5% of male analgesic users). Men who reported pain in the preceding year were more likely to use multiple analgesic products. Women who experienced pain or limited physical functioning, or who had higher depressive symptom scores or a life-time history of ulcers were most likely to use multiple analgesic products. Thus, although some users of multiple analgesic products reported significant pain, several other factors were shown to be related to the phenomenon of multiple use. 
4	Doxazosin effects on insulin and glucose in hypertensive patients. The Finnish Multicenter Study Group. This study investigates the effects of prolonged doxazosin treatment on serum lipids, glucose, serum insulin, and blood pressure in hypertensive patients. Following 26 weeks of treatment with doxazosin, supine and standing blood pressures were significantly decreased at a final mean daily dose of 6.4 mg. Blood glucose levels were significantly lower at 26 weeks than after the initial placebo period (p less than 0.05) or after 4 weeks' treatment with doxazosin (p less than 0.001). There was a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in serum insulin levels following 4 weeks of treatment, and a highly significant (p less than 0.001) decrease after 26 weeks. In addition, doxazosin produced a significant reduction in total cholesterol (p less than 0.05) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (p less than 0.01) after 26 weeks, although the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides showed no significant change. There was a tendency for the ratio of HDL: total cholesterol to increase. The combined changes in blood pressure, blood glucose levels, serum insulin, and serum lipids favorably affect the probability of developing coronary heart disease (CHD). 
4	Gynecologic vascular abnormalities: diagnosis with Doppler US. The authors describe the use of duplex and/or color Doppler ultrasonography of the pelvis in three women to demonstrate the presence of venous malformations. One patient with a pulsatile vaginal mass was shown to have an arteriovenous malformation of the vaginal wall. The second patient was shown to have an unsuspected venous angioma in the endometrial cavity. The third patient was shown to have adnexal varices that closely mimicked hydrosalpinx. In the latter two cases, the duplex and color flow capabilities of an endovaginal probe were especially important. 
1	Spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage: imaging and management. We report on 10 patients with spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage associated with underlying disease, including renal cell carcinoma (5), angiomyolipoma (2), malignant melanoma (1), periarteritis nodosa (1) and severe portal hypertension (1). The etiology could not be identified with computerized tomography (CT) in 5 cases (50%), including 2 renal cell carcinomas, 1 angiomyolipoma, 1 periarteritis nodosa and 1 portal hypertension. Arteriography demonstrated underlying lesions in 4 of these 5 cases (80%) including the case of vasculitis. CT combined with magnetic resonance imaging is accurate for the diagnosis of spontaneous perinephric hemorrhage but the underlying pathological condition is often undetectable in the acute phase due to the perinephric blood. CT should be the first study performed if this diagnosis is suspected. Arteriography is recommended if a renal mass is not detected. If a mass is not identified with these 2 imaging studies and the patient is clinically stable, followup thin slice CT should be performed. 
2	Susceptibility to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis: human leukocyte antigens DR4 and A1-B8-DR3 are independent risk factors. After nearly 18 years of research, the association between human leukocyte antigens A1-B8-DR3 and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis still provokes debate. The principal reasons for this are disease heterogeneity and racial variation in the distribution of human leukocyte antigens between populations. The aim of the present study was to reexamine the relationship between these antigens and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a well-characterized series of patients. Ninety-six outpatients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and an additional 14 referred for liver transplantation with end-stage autoimmune chronic active hepatitis were studied. Human leukocyte antigen frequencies were compared with those of 100 racially and geographically matched controls. The A1-B8-DR3 haplotype was present in 38% of patients compared with 11% of controls (chi 2 = 20.6, p less than 0.0005). When all the DR3-positive patients were eliminated, there was a striking secondary association with DR4; 35 (80%) of 44 remaining patients were DR4 positive compared with 31 (39%) of 79 DR3-negative controls (Fisher's exact probability test p = 0.000031, pc = 0.0013). In addition patients with A1-B8-DR3 are seen at a significantly younger age than those without (39.75 yr vs. 48.21 yr, p less than 0.025), relapse more frequently (52% of patients with A1-B8-DR3 relapsed on one or more occasions compared with 34% of patients without this haplotype) and are more frequently referred for liver transplantation. These data indicate for the first time that two genes within the major histocompatibility complex closely linked to the DR3 and DR4 genes independently confer susceptibility to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis. 
5	Clinicopathological features of elevated lesions of the duodenal bulb. We present here our findings on patients with an elevated lesion of the duodenal bulb. All these patients were treated in our clinics between the years 1984 and 1988. These lesions were present in 36 of 8,802 patients who underwent upper gastrointestinal pan-endoscopy. Two patients had a duodenal carcinoma, 2 an adenoma, and 1 a Brunner's gland adenoma. There were 15 with a hyperplastic polyp, 3 with a heterogenic gastric mucosa, 3 with Brunner's gland hyperplasia, 6 with duodenitis, and 4 with regenerative mucosa. Among these 36 lesions, only 69% (25 lesions) were evident on the upper gastrointestinal X-ray series. Adenoma and Brunner's gland adenoma were of a pedunculated form of the gross type and had an irregular surface mucosa. Both duodenal carcinomas were detected by endoscopic biopsy and were resected. Histologically, these lesions were limited to the submucosal layer and were of the non-pedunculated polypoid form, but there were no other characteristic endoscopic features, in comparison with other elevated lesions. Thus, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy with routine observations of the duodenal bulb plus endoscopic biopsy will lead to a definite diagnosis of these elevated lesions and to the early detection and treatment of this rare malignant lesion. 
4	Silent myocardial ischemia during rehabilitation for cerebrovascular disease. In asymptomatic patients the importance of silent ischemic ST-T wave changes on Holter monitoring is known to be a significant predictive variable for one-year mortality of postmyocardial infarction patients. This case report represents the uses of ambulatory ECG to detect ischemic ST changes in patients who have had recent strokes. The cases reported here of silent myocardiac ischemia in stroke patients reflect previous reports in which 70% of the ischemic episodes in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease are not associated with angina and in which approximately 10% to 15% of acute myocardial infarctions are silent. We now believe that the incidence of "silent" ischemia may be precipitated in poststroke patients during their rehabilitation program. This belief is supported by two main factors. First, a high level of personally relevant mental stress exists which activates the sympathoadrenal system, which may lead to myocardial ischemia. Second, some stroke patients become aphasic and are unable to communicate adequately even if they experience angina symptoms. We have found that poststroke, most patients could not undergo exercise treadmill testing secondary to a variety of factors: inability to coordinate limbs, poor endurance, inability to follow directions, and/or lack of attention. We now propose that 24-hour monitoring for ST-T wave changes poststroke should be considered as part of a vigorous investigation for myocardial ischemia during the rehabilitation of these patients because they have an increased risk of cardiac morbidity. 
3	The painful shoulder: Part I. Extrinsic disorders. Shoulder disorders are most commonly manifested by pain and limited function. Careful history and examination help the physician localize the problem to the shoulder joint, the surrounding tissues or adjacent sites that can cause referred pain to the shoulder. Common extrinsic causes of shoulder pain include postural problems and cervical spine disorders. 
2	Intraperitoneal lymphokine-activated killer-cell and interleukin-2 therapy for malignancies limited to the peritoneal cavity. Autologous lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2) were administered intraperitoneally (IP) to 24 patients with malignancies limited to the peritoneal space. Ten patients had ovarian cancer, 12 had colorectal cancer, and one patient each had endometrial carcinoma and primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma. All ovarian cancer patients, three of twelve colorectal cancer patients, and one patient with endometrial carcinoma had received prior therapy. Patients received IL-2 100,000 U/kg every 8 hours intravenously (IV) for 3 days, and 2 days later underwent daily leukapheresis for 5 days. LAK cells were generated in vitro by incubating the peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IL-2 for 7 days and were then administered IP daily for 5 days through a Tenckhoff catheter (Davol, Inc, Cranston, RI) together with IL-2 25,000 U/kg IP every 8 hours. All but one patient completed at least one cycle of therapy. Toxic side effects included minor to moderate hypotension, fever, chills, rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and distension, diarrhea, oliguria, fluid retention, thrombocytopenia, and minor elevations of liver function tests; all of these rapidly improved after discontinuation of IL-2. One patient had a grand mal seizure, and one suffered a colonic perforation; these were felt to be treatment-related. IP fibrosis developed in 14 patients and limited repeated cyclic administration of this therapy in five patients. Two of 10 (20%) ovarian cancer patients and five of 12 (42%) colorectal cancer patients had laparoscopy- or laparotomy-documented partial responses. We conclude that LAK cells and rIL-2 can be administered IP to cancer patients, resulting in moderate to severe short-term toxicity and modest therapeutic efficacy. Further investigation of this form of adoptive immunotherapy modified to address the problem of IP fibrosis and with lower IP IL-2 doses is justified by these initial results. 
5	Biotype as determinant of natural immunising effect of cholera. To test the hypothesis that clinical Vibrio cholerae O1 infections protect against recurrent cholera, treated cholera episodes in a rural Bangladesh population of 188,153 people who were followed between 1985 and 1988 were analysed. Of the 2214 people with initial episodes of cholera, 7 had a second episode. The incidence of cholera was 61% lower in subjects who had had an earlier episode than in those without such an episode. Whereas initial episodes of classical cholera were associated with complete protection against subsequent cholera, initial episodes of El Tor cholera were associated with negligible protection. 
1	Analysis of antigen expression at multiple tumor sites in epithelial ovarian cancer. The question of whether the antigenic phenotype of human epithelial ovarian cancer varies in a given patient between the primary tumor and metastatic sites or among metastatic sites themselves is an important issue in planning potential therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer. We have obtained tumor specimens from at least two separate sites during operations on 12 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, and we have typed these specimens with a group of 18 monoclonal antibodies that react with cell-surface glycoprotein and carbohydrate antigens, including blood group antigens. Antibodies with relative specificity for malignant cells as well as those that detect more widely distributed epithelial antigens were used. A total of 31 specimens from 12 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma (8 serous, 3 undifferentiated, 1 endometrioid) of the ovary were studied, including fresh ascites cells in two patients. Frozen sections of tumor specimens were stained with the antibodies by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique and graded semiquantitatively. Little difference was seen in antigenic expression of tumors that were obtained from various sites in the same patient for either the epithelial cell markers or blood group markers. Intratumoral antigenic heterogeneity was seen, but this was generally quite consistent within a given patient's specimens. As anticipated, variations in antigen expression were seen among specimens from different patients. The antigenic phenotype of the tumor specimens in a given patient, as determined immunohistochemically by our group of antibodies, showed only minor variation among primary and metastatic sites. 
1	Validation of intermediate end points in cancer research. Investigations using intermediate end points as cancer surrogates are quicker, smaller, and less expensive than studies that use malignancy as the end point. We present a strategy for determining whether a given biomarker is a valid intermediate end point between an exposure and incidence of cancer. Candidate intermediate end points may be selected from case series, ecologic studies, and animal experiments. Prospective cohort and sometimes case-control studies may be used to quantify the intermediate end point-cancer association. The most appropriate measure of this association is the attributable proportion. The intermediate end point is a valid cancer surrogate if the attributable proportion is close to 1.0, but not if it is close to 0. Usually, the attributable proportion is close to neither 1.0 nor 0; in this case, valid surrogacy requires that the intermediate end point mediate an established exposure-cancer relation. This would in turn imply that the exposure effect would vanish if adjusted for the intermediate end point. We discuss the relative advantages of intervention and observational studies for the validation of intermediate end points. This validation strategy also may be applied to intermediate end points for adverse reproductive outcomes and chronic diseases other than cancer. 
1	Assessment of "squamous cell carcinoma antigen" (SCC) as a marker of epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal. We measured squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC) in epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal in 66 patients. Samples were taken at diagnosis, before treatment, and during follow-up; 353 samples were analyzed. The positive threshold was taken as 2 ng/ml. At diagnosis, the sensitivity of the marker was 44 percent and its specificity 92 percent. In our series, the pretherapeutic level of SCC does not correlate with T as in Papillons' Clinical Staging System, but it does correlate with nodal invasion (P less than 0.05). It is of no prognostic value at the time of diagnosis. During follow-up, at relapse the level of SCC is 20.3 +/- 43 ng/ml. This increase is significant (P less than 0.01): the sensitivity of the marker is 77 percent. In patients who have relapsed, development of the illness correlates with the level of SCC, which is of prognostic value (P less than 0.01). In conclusion, the level of SCC should be associated with the clinical follow-up of patients with epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal. 
3	Effects of the calcium antagonist nilvadipine on focal cerebral ischemia in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We studied the efficacy of preischemic and postischemic systemic treatment with a new calcium antagonist nilvadipine in a permanent focal cerebral ischemia model of spontaneously hypertensive rats. Rats that underwent microsurgical middle cerebral artery occlusion were blindly assigned to a single intraperitoneal injection of nilvadipine (0.32 mg/kg) or the same amount of polyethylene glycol either 15 minutes before, immediately after, 1 hour after, or 3 hours after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery. Neurologic conditions of rats were closely examined, and rats were killed 24 hours later. Removed brains were sliced coronally, stained with triphenyltetrazolium chloride, and the size of infarct was determined. Although no neurologic improvements were observed in the treated rats, the area of infarcts was significantly reduced in the groups treated before, immediately after, and 1 hour after occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Treatment started 3 hours after occlusion was ineffective. 
1	Bilateral malignant phyllodes tumours. We report a rare example of bilateral primary malignant phyllodes tumours. The diagnosis was supported by the identification of a benign epithelial element in each lesion. The case illustrates the typical dimorphic features of malignant phyllodes tumours. A contralateral tumour should not be regarded as metastatic without histological confirmation. 
1	Principles of treatment of pediatric solid tumors. Great strides have been made in the treatment of pediatric solid tumors over the last three decades. A multimodality approach involving a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy is now used in the treatment of these diseases. This article reviews the principles that guide the use of these modalities and the multidisciplinary approach used to integrate them into a coordinated treatment plan. The role of each modality in the control of local and systemic disease is described. Radiation treatment planning, dose fractionation, and toxicity are also discussed. 
5	Effect of pentoxifylline on hemodynamics, alveolar fluid reabsorption, and pulmonary edema in a model of acute lung injury. We investigated the effect of pentoxifylline (PTX) on the development of pulmonary edema in a model of adult respiratory distress syndrome in rabbits. Lung injury was induced by repeated saline lavages in adult rabbits weighing 2.5 to 3.5 kg. Rabbits pretreated with PTX (20 mg/kg bolus followed by 20 mg/kg/h infusion) developed significantly lower amounts of lung edema 4 h after saline lavage (extravascular lung water to dry weight ratio [W/D], 6.9 +/- 0.6 SD versus 8.9 +/- 0.5 in control animals). PTX produced a 25% increase in cardiac output, but there were no differences between treated and untreated groups in calculated pulmonary vascular resistance or microvascular pressure. To determine whether PTX could have lowered pulmonary venous resistance and thus lowered effective microvascular pressure for fluid filtration, we directly measured pulmonary artery and left atrial pressures, and measured by micropuncture the pressure in 20 to 40 microns subpleural venules in four open-chested rabbits 3 to 4 h after lavage. Venous resistance was low (venous pressure drop 0.9 +/- 0.1 mm Hg) and was unchanged by PTX infusion. To determine if PTX decreased lung water by accelerating active alveolar fluid reabsorption, a single 60-ml aliquot of saline was instilled into the lungs of normal rabbits treated with saline or PTX. Both groups had a similar decrease in lung water content 1 and 4 h later. Our data indicate that PTX reduces edema formation in rabbits after saline lavage, not by lowering microvascular pressures for fluid filtration or by acceleration alveolar fluid reabsorption, but possibly by its anti-inflammatory effect on neutrophil function. 
1	Haemangiosarcoma of the maxillary antrum. Angiosarcomas are extremely rare in the head and neck and the histological diagnosis is often difficult. We present a case of a haemangiosarcoma of the maxillary antrum in a 33 year old male. The histological diagnosis and subsequent management are discussed. 
4	The hyperlipidemia of the nephrotic syndrome. Lipid abnormalities in patients with the nephrotic syndrome have long been recognized. However, the significance of these lipid abnormalities, the mechanisms producing them, and their potential treatment have all been a cause of debate. Recent data have helped clarify each of these areas of controversy. Studies of the lipoprotein abnormalities of patients with the uncomplicated nephrotic syndrome have shown that many will have elevated levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas only a few will have elevated levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. If these lipid abnormalities have the same significance in this population as in other populations studied, then some patients with unremitting nephrotic syndrome will be at high risk for cardiovascular disease. The elevated cholesterol levels noted in the nephrotic syndrome are caused primarily by enhanced hepatic synthesis, with lesser contributions by decreased clearance and altered enzyme activities. The signal for enhanced hepatic lipogenesis may relate to changes in plasma albumin concentration, plasma oncotic pressure, a local effect of viscosity at the hepatic sinusoidal level, or a loss of urinary proteins or other liporegulatory substances. Recently, a number of short-term studies in nephrotic patients have documented the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs such as the bile acid-binding resins, probucol, and the HMGCoA (hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors. 
5	Patient factors predicting early alcohol-related readmissions for alcoholics: role of alcoholism severity and psychiatric co-morbidity. The current study was undertaken primarily to identify whether psychiatric co-morbidity was associated with the rate and time of alcohol-related inpatient readmissions for a group of 255 patients discharged from alcoholism treatment at a midwestern rural medical center. A structured interview obtained information regarding psychiatric disorders, including depression, antisocial personality disorders and polysubstance abuse, as well as alcohol history and sociodemographics. Ninety-eight subjects (38.4% of sample) were readmitted for alcoholism-related diagnoses within 15 months of discharge. Patients with a long history of heavy drinking, high daily alcohol consumption and history of previous alcoholism treatment were most likely to be readmitted with an alcoholism-related primary diagnosis. Once these variables were controlled for, other major psychiatric disorders, polysubstances abuse and sociodemographic variables did not appear to predict time to readmission. However, other potentially more sensitive outcome measures such as return to drinking were not evaluated in the present study. 
5	The "stuck twin" phenomenon: ultrasonographic findings, pregnancy outcome, and management with serial amniocenteses. Thirteen consecutive twin pregnancies affected by the "stuck twin" phenomenon were reviewed to determine the potential benefit of serial amniocenteses. The fetal survival rate for the eight pregnancies that underwent serial amniocenteses was 69% (11 of 16 fetuses). This is significantly improved compared with a fetal survival rate of 20% among the five preceding pregnancies managed without serial amniocenteses at the same institution (p = 0.01). It is also markedly improved compared with a combined fetal survival rate of 16% among 48 previously reported pregnancies with the stuck twin phenomenon managed without serial amniocenteses (p less than 0.0001). Survival correlated with the absence of concomitant pregnancy complications (i.e., maternal hypertension or intractable labor) and with the absence of severe fetal structural abnormalities. Procedural complications occurred in three of eight pregnancies (37.5%) managed with serial amniocenteses and was attributed as a cause of fetal death in one case. Two of 11 survivors (18%) had complications after serial amniocenteses including brain infarction and renal tubular necrosis. Serial amniocenteses may significantly improve the survival rate of twin gestations affected by the stuck twin phenomenon but may be associated with complications among survivors. 
1	Razor-blade surgery. The razor blade can be a valuable tool in the performance of many minor surgical procedures. It is extremely sharp, flexible, inexpensive, readily available, and easy to use. The technique and specific applications are reviewed and discussed. 
2	Cryptosporidium infection in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: not always a poor prognosis. Chronic diarrhea and malabsorption accompanied by simultaneous infection with the protozoa Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium occurred in a 22-year-old homosexual man with antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Small bowel biopsy demonstrated total villous atrophy and marked mononuclear infiltration in the lamina propria simulating celiac disease. Treatment with metronidazole resulted in resolution of diarrhea, clearance of parasites, and marked improvement in small bowel histology. Although diarrhea and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients with cryptosporidiosis are regarded as ominous, our patient remained disease free for the next 3 years. Thus, infection with Cryptosporidium in patients with HIV does not always lead to intractable diarrhea or death. 
1	Femoral mononeuropathy after radical prostatectomy. Femoral mononeuropathy is a recognized complication following abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy. Retractor injury and lithotomy position were postulated mechanisms. We report a femoral nerve lesion following a radical perineal prostatectomy. 
3	The effectiveness of different methods of defining traumatic brain injury in predicting postdischarge adjustment in a spinal cord injury population. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can occur concomitantly with spinal cord injury (SCI). Much of the initial work in this area has focused on identifying coincidence rates and risk factors; less has focused on possible long-term implications of TBI when it occurs with SCI. In this study, SCI/TBI and neurologically matched SCI-only groups were formed on the basis of clinicians' ratings of neuropsychologic test scores. SCI/TBI and SCI-only groups were also formed using Halstead Category cutoff scores, presence/absence of loss of consciousness, and clinicians' ratings of severity of TBI. Dependent measures assessed an average of two years postinjury measured personal, social, and family adjustment of the individual with SCI and that of a significant other. Loss of consciousness and nonconsensus clinical ratings of presence/absence of TBI predicted postdischarge adjustment poorly. Severity ratings in the moderate to severe range, and Category cutoff scores did have some predictive value, with patients defined as impaired being more likely to report adjustment difficulties or being described as having adjustment difficulties by a significant other. The difficulty of making unequivocal diagnoses of TBI in this population is discussed and implications for future research delineated. 
1	Squamous cell carcinoma in situ arising in an ovarian mature cystic teratoma. Report of one case with histopathologic, cytogenetic, and flow cytometric DNA content analysis. A squamous cell carcinoma in situ arose in an ovarian mature teratoma (ie, dermoid cyst) in a 62-year-old woman. Flow cytometric DNA content analysis of paraffin-embedded in situ carcinoma showed a normal DNA content with moderate to high proliferative activity (S-phase fraction estimate, 16% to 18%). Cytogenetic analysis of the in situ cancer and the benign cystic portion of the tumor revealed a 46,XX karyotype. In addition, the benign cystic portion of the tumor revealed homozygous chromosomal heteromorphisms, compared with heterozygous markers found in peripheral blood lymphocytes. These results show that this squamous cell carcinoma in situ was euploid and suggest that the mature cystic teratoma was derived from a single germ cell after meiosis I. 
1	Steroid cell tumor of the ovary in a child. An 8-year-old girl exhibited severe, progressive virilization of 2 years' duration associated with markedly elevated circulating testosterone concentrations. Based on her initial clinical presentation and results of a chemical evaluation, she was originally thought to have non-classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but her condition did not respond to corticosteroid therapy. Further evaluation confirmed the presence of an ovarian neoplasm. The excised ovary contained an attached gray-brown mass. Light microscopic and ultrastructural examination revealed the mass to be a steroid cell tumor. Because Reinke's crystals were not present, it was designated to be a steroid cell tumor not otherwise specified. This case represents one of 22 reported cases of steroid cell tumor occurring in children described in the literature, most of which have been associated with heterosexual precocity. To our knowledge, steroid cell tumors are benign when they occur in prepubertal children. Although they are rare, steroid cell tumors of the ovary should be considered in cases of childhood virilization. 
5	Intussusception encephalopathy: an underrecognized cause of coma in children. Intestinal intussusception is a common cause of bowel obstruction in infancy and early childhood. Typically the presenting signs and symptoms are referable to the abdomen. On occasion the most prominent presenting feature is depressed level of consciousness. We describe 3 patients who presented with coma associated with intussusception. 
4	The prevalence of cardiac valvular pathosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of valvular pathosis in a population of patients with SLE, to assess the candidacy of such patients for antibiotic prophylaxis before dental treatment. The hospital records of 112 patients with SLE were reviewed and screened for endocarditis, heart murmurs, and other valvular pathosis. Two of the 112 patients had confirmed cases of bacterial endocarditis. This prevalence is comparable to endocarditis prevalence rates in patients with prosthetic valves and is also three times that in patients with rheumatic heart disease. The high prevalence of endocarditis in this population of patients with SLE suggests that according to present perspectives on patient management, patients with SLE should be considered for antibiotic prophylaxis before dental therapies associated with formation of a bacteremia. 
4	Angioscopy for intraoperative management of thromboembolectomy. Our experience with angioscopy suggests that direct visualization of the arterial lumen during thromboembolectomy procedures would provide a more reliable method of assessing luminal morphologic characteristics than angiography alone. We inspected 32 grafts (seven aortobifemoral, 18 infrainguinal bypass, and seven dialysis access fistula grafts) in 32 patients. Thirty-one patients had thrombotic events and one patient had an acute embolus. Angioscopy following standard catheter thrombectomy revealed significant amounts of retained thrombus or neointima in all thrombectomies. Angioscopic information from 18 patients with an infrainguinal bypass graft led to graft revision in six cases and placement of a new graft in 10 cases. One graft limb was replaced in seven aortobifemoral grafts, and multiple repeated thrombectomies were employed to extract debris in the remaining six cases. Repeated graft thrombectomy was also beneficial in dialysis access fistulas. Angioscopy allowed us to omit the completion angiogram and led to an improved technical result. We conclude that angioscopy is useful during thromboembolectomy procedures. 
2	Antibodies in anti-HBe-positive patient sera bind to an HBe protein expressed on the cell surface of human hepatoma cells: implications for virus clearance. The relevance of the recently described membrane-bound form of the HBe protein for the antiviral immune response was examined. The data show that antibodies in anti-HBe, but not in anti-HBc-positive human sera efficiently bind to the membrane expressed HBe. No evidence was obtained that the HBc can reach the cell surface in a form that can be detected with human antibodies. The findings suggest that the decline of virus titer that is usually observed after seroconversion from HBe to anti-HBe might be the result of an antibody-mediated elimination of infected cells. 
5	Follicular thyroid cancer treated at the Mayo Clinic, 1946 through 1970: initial manifestations, pathologic findings, therapy, and outcome We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of all patients who received their primary treatment for follicular thyroid cancer at the Mayo Clinic between 1946 and 1970. The diagnosis was confirmed by reexamination of preserved tissue specimens. The 57 female and 43 male patients (mean age, 53 years) underwent follow-up for a maximum of 32 years (mean, 17.4 years). All patients were treated surgically, and total removal of primary tumor was thought to have been accomplished in all but three. Only 2 of the 88 patients without distant metastatic lesions at the time of initial diagnosis underwent ablation of the thyroid remnant. At the conclusion of the study, 52 patients had died, thyroid cancer being the cause of death in 19. On the basis of univariate survival analysis, age more than 50 years, tumor size that exceeded 3.9 cm, higher tumor grade, presence of marked vascular invasion, adjacent tissue invasion, and distant metastatic involvement at the time of initial diagnosis were associated with increased cancer mortality. Multivariate analysis (by Cox proportional hazards model), however, identified only age greater than 50 years, marked vascular invasion, and metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis to be independent predictors of follicular thyroid cancer-related mortality. Patients with two or more of these predictors were classified as being high risk. These patients had 5- and 20-year survival rates of 47% and 8%, respectively; the corresponding survival data for the low-risk group were 99% at 5 years and 86% at 20 years. The identification of these risk groups may facilitate a more rational approach to treatment of follicular thyroid cancer. 
3	The nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the specific nature and course of olfactory deficits in Alzheimer's disease. Previous studies had noted impaired odor identification, but there was no unanimity about the presence of odor detection deficits. METHOD: Odor identification was tested in 55 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 57 elderly control subjects by using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test. Odor detection was assessed in 46 subjects with Alzheimer's disease and 40 control subjects by using a forced-choice threshold test with geraniol as the odorant. RESULTS: Significant deficits in olfactory identification were present in subjects who were in the earliest stages of cognitive impairment, and these deficits increased as Alzheimer's disease progressed. There was some overlap in individual smell identification test scores between cognitively impaired patients and normal elderly subjects. On the other hand, odor detection deficits did not appear until Alzheimer's disease was relatively advanced. Smell identification test scores were correlated with Mini-Mental State scores, but geraniol detection was not. CONCLUSIONS: Odor identification is impaired early in Alzheimer's disease and may be more influenced by cognitive status than is acuity of odor detection, which is not altered until later in the disorder. The pattern of hyposmia in Alzheimer's disease suggests that the disorder may not "begin in the nose," as has been theorized previously. Further refinement of olfactory testing may be useful in the diagnostic evaluation of early dementia. 
5	Prevalence of carcinoma in situ and other histopathological abnormalities in testes from 399 men who died suddenly and unexpectedly. To determine the prevalence of carcinoma in situ of the testis and other testicular histopathological abnormalities in the general male population, we examined gonads from 399 men 18 to 50 years old who died suddenly and unexpectedly. No sign of malignancy was found in any of these gonads. However, 3 of the 399 men had been previously treated for testicular tumor or carcinoma in situ. Thus, the over-all prevalence of testicular neoplasia in the population studied was 0.8% (95% confidence limits 0.2 to 2.2%). This frequency is of the same magnitude as the lifetime risk of testicular cancer in the Danish male population. The median weights of the left and right testes were 19.3 and 19.7 gm., respectively. This difference was statistically significant (p = 0.00003). Thus, our study confirmed that on average the left testis is smaller than the right testis. The median weight of the gonads collected in our study was 0.9 gm. lower than the weight of testes examined 40 years earlier at the same department of forensic medicine. However, this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.17). Microscopic examination of the gonadal specimens revealed that 83% of the men exhibited complete spermatogenesis, including late spermatids in all tubules. In the age group studied we found no age-related changes in testicular weight or in the proportion of tubules with degenerative changes, such as spermatogenic arrest, the Sertoli-cell-only syndrome or hyalinization. 
2	Limitations in the evaluation of therapy in inflammatory bowel disease: suggestions for future research. The current treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), though improved over earlier therapies, remains variable rather than consistent and supportive rather than curative. The similar management of ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), which are thought to be differing though related disorders, suggests that therapy is nonspecific. The variation in therapeutic practices results from the fact that the etiologies of the diseases are obscure, from limited knowledge of the biological and pharmacological actions of drugs commonly prescribed (sulfasalazine, 5-ASA compounds, steroids, 6-MP and azathioprine), from an inadequate understanding of genetic differences influencing drug metabolism, from insufficient awareness of the factors influencing drug efficiency (concurrent use of antimotility drugs, cigarette smoking, food combinations), from the variability of the patient groups studied (extent and severity of disease), and from incomplete documentation of the clinical status of patients at the time of therapeutic trial. Future advances in treatment will depend on gaining new information about the nature of IBD and of drug pharmacology and bioavailability, derived from collaborative studies by clinicians, clinical investigators, and basic scientists. Important areas for IBD research include the biology of intestinal epithelium, the nature of the IBD inflammatory reaction and of gut mucosal immune regulation (via the application of new biotechnologies) and more representative experimental animal models. Decisive multicenter therapeutic studies require agreement on definitions of ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, accurate characterization of patient groups, acceptable objective criteria of IBD severity and activity, and reliable indicators of therapeutic response. 
4	Sex differences in control of cutaneous blood flow. Women are far more likely than men to suffer from Raynaud's disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether there are gender differences in local or central control of cutaneous blood flow that could account for the increased incidence of Raynaud's disease in women. To assess cutaneous blood flow, hand blood flow (HBF), finger blood flow (FBF), or skin perfusion (SP) was measured by fluid plethysmography, mercury strain-gauge plethysmography, or laser Doppler spectroscopy, respectively, in 47 volunteers. Basal HBF in men exceeded that of women (12.1 +/- 2.0 versus 6.2 +/- 1.5 ml/100 ml/min). Likewise, FBF in men surpassed that of women (19.5 +/- 4.1 versus 7.7 +/- 1.8 ml/100 ml/min). Similarly, SP in men was greater than that of women (270 +/- 42 versus 81 +/- 16 perfusion units). However, after total body warming (to induce a thermal sympatholysis), HBF in women exceeded that of men, suggesting that the lower basal HBF in women was due to increased sympathetic outflow to the extremities. Mental stress and deep inspiration reduced HBF and SP in men. Paradoxically, both of these maneuvers increased HBF and SP in women. To determine whether these paradoxical responses in women were due to the women's elevated basal sympathetic tone, these experiments were repeated after total body cooling in men to increase sympathetic tone and after total body warming in women to reduce sympathetic tone. Total body cooling reduced HBF and SP in men. Under these conditions, mental stress and deep inspiration induced vasodilation. In women, total body warming for 10 minutes increased HBF. 
4	Outcome of prophylactic therapy for idiopathic anaphylaxis. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of a prophylactic regimen (prednisone, H1 blockade, and sympathomimetic amine therapy) in patients with idiopathic anaphylaxis. DESIGN: Clinical trial before and after treatment. SETTING: Referral-based allergy clinic at a major medical center. PATIENTS: Fifty-three patients with a history compatible with idiopathic anaphylaxis for at least 6 months before presentation to the allergy service and with subsequent management by the service for at least 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Patients with frequent life-threatening symptoms were treated with a prophylactic regimen. Patients with infrequent episodes of idiopathic anaphylaxis were only treated acutely for each episode of anaphylaxis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The results favored prophylactic treatment with prednisone for patients who were classified as generalized-frequent in the clinical outcome measures of frequency (per patient per year) of episodes (mean before treatment, 7.31 +/- 6.46; after treatment, 3.61 +/- 4.73; P less than 0.02) and emergency room visits (mean before treatment, 1.94 +/- 3.42; after treatment, 0.21 +/- 0.44; P less than 0.005) and for patients classified as angioedema-frequent in the frequency of episodes (mean before treatment, 14.93 +/- 15.89; after treatment, 2.58 +/- 2.18; P less than 0.003) and emergency room visits (mean before treatment, 0.76 +/- 1.01; after treatment, 0.07 +/- 0.11; P less than 0.025). No statistically significant difference was found for patients classified as generalized-infrequent in the frequency of episodes (mean before treatment, 2.01 +/- 1.30; after treatment, 1.36 +/- 1.79) or of the emergency room visits (mean before treatment, 0.56 +/- 0.71; after treatment, 0.32 +/- 0.75) or for patients classified as angioedema-infrequent in the frequency of episodes (mean before treatment, 1.94 +/- 1.55; after treatment, 2.03 +/- 2.16) or of emergency room visits (mean before treatment, 0.27 +/- 0.44; after treatment, 0.37 +/- 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: Prophylactic treatment with prednisone and H1 antihistamines with or without sympathomimetic amines improves clinical outcome in patients who are classified as idiopathic anaphylaxis-angioedema frequent and idiopathic anaphylaxis-generalized frequent. 
5	Outpatient orthognathic surgery: criteria and a review of cases. Over a 9-year period, 87 orthognathic procedures were performed in an outpatient environment. Procedures performed included horizontal mandibular osteotomies, rapid palatal expansions, bilateral sagittal split osteotomies, posterior and anterior maxillary osteotomies, and Le Fort I osteotomies. Fourteen of these patients were subsequently admitted to a hospital for either observation or full inpatient care. The rates of admission varied for each of the procedures, with length of anesthesia statistically related to the frequency of admission. Patient selection criteria and facilities used are reviewed. 
5	Acute respiratory tract infection in children in Idikan Community, Ibadan, Nigeria: severity, risk factors, and frequency of occurrence. A longitudinal, community-based study of the epidemiology of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) in children less than 5 years old was carried out in a community of low socioeconomic level in Ibadan, Nigeria. The annual incidence of ARI ranged from 6.1 to 8.1 episodes per child per year. The incidence was highest in the first 2 years of life and decreased with increasing age. The incidence was higher in boys than in girls. ARI occurred in all seasons of the year. The most common symptoms were cough, nasal discharge, and fever, while the most common signs referable to the respiratory tract were abnormal breathing sounds, tachypnea, and chest retraction. 
5	Polyglucosan body disease. Adult polyglucosan disease has been described in 15 cases. All had signs of peripheral neuropathy, upper motor neuron signs, and 12 of the 15 had sphincter problems. Dementia was prominent in 8 of 15 cases. We reported 2 cases that contained these clinical features. Electrophysiological studies showed axonal neuropathy. Somatosensory evoked potentials on the second patient were abnormal. Sural nerve biopsy showed clusters of polyglucosan bodies. Although the presence of polyglucosan bodies in biopsy is nonspecific, the number as well as the clinical features are necessary to make the diagnosis. Branching enzyme activity in muscle extracts of the muscles were normal. Hence, a specific enzyme abnormality is not yet known. 
5	Posthospital course and outcome in schizophrenia. To study the early course of schizophrenia, we assessed 79 early phase, young, DSM-III schizophrenic patients at two successive posthospital follow-ups, 2.5 and 5.0 years after index hospitalization. More than 50% of the sample had poor overall outcome, with either severe impairment in functioning and symptoms, or suicide, in the follow-up period. Rehospitalization rates decreased significantly during the course of the two posthospital assessments, despite the sample showing persisting psychosis. Only a small group of schizophrenic patients showed complete remission: 10% at the first follow-up and 17% at the second follow-up, when patients who suicided are excluded from consideration. While progressive deterioration is not common in schizophrenia, our relatively negative findings challenge the conclusions of some other longitudinal studies. Implications of our data on schizophrenic course are discussed. 
2	Incidence of gallstones in a Danish population. Five-year incidence of gallstone disease was assessed by ultrasonography in an age- and sex-stratified random population of Danish origin aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years. The response rate was 82.8% (2987/3608). Nonrespondents did not differ from respondents regarding variables concerning gallstone disease. The 5-year incidence of gallstone disease in men aged 30, 40, 50, and 60 years was 0.3%, 2.9%, 2.5%, and 3.3%. Corresponding figures in women were 1.4%, 3.6%, 3.1%, and 3.7%. The incidence of gallstones was significantly higher in subjects aged 45 years or more compared with those aged 35 years. The sex difference in gallstone incidence decreased with increasing age. A significantly higher incidence of gallstone disease was found among subjects with former polyps in the gallbladder. Spontaneous disappearance of gallstones was seen in 4.5%. 
5	A randomized controlled evaluation of a psychosocial intervention in adults with chronic lung disease. The effect of a stress management program on morbidity and psychosocial and physical function in patients with chronic lung disease was assessed. Adults attending either a VA pulmonary clinic or university hospital pulmonary rehabilitation clinic who met criteria for obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease were randomly assigned to receive the intervention or to a control group. The intervention was provided by a nurse and included one to three teaching sessions, reading material, audiotapes, and telephone follow-up. The program focused on stress management techniques such as cognitive restructuring, progressive relaxation, breathing exercises, and visual imagery. The 45 experimental subjects were similar to the 49 controls with respect to baseline characteristics. Experimental and control subjects had similar rates of mortality, hospital days, bed-disability days, restricted-activity days, and physician visits during the 12-month follow-up. There were no differences between the two groups in physical or psychosocial function at six months or in levels of stressful life changes, social supports, and self-esteem at six and 12 months. Intervention recipients had better function at 12 months, suggesting a possible benefit of the intervention. 
1	Experimental intravesical therapy for superficial transitional cell carcinoma in a rat bladder tumor model. A rodent bladder cancer model that is induced by intravesical instillation of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was characterized. Cohorts of four to five week old female Fisher 344 rats received four biweekly 1.5 mg. doses of intravesical MNU and were sacrificed at various intervals. By week 13 all animals had flat atypia and/or papillary transitional cell tumors, and 67% of the lesions were moderately (grade II) or poorly differentiated (grade III). By week 20, 83% had gross muscle invasive tumors that eventually killed the host. A cohort of 40 MNU treated animals was subsequently treated commencing at week 17 after initiation of MNU with one of three intravesical six week regimens: 1) saline; 2) BCG (Tice strain); or 3) recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (RTNF) plus adriamycin. There was no difference in animal survival or tumor growth in any group of animals commencing therapy at week 17. A second cohort of 107 animals commenced therapy at 13 weeks after initiation of MNU with one of five intravesical six week regimens: 1) intravesical BCG (Tice strain); 2) adriamycin; 3) recombinant human tumor necrosis factor (RTNF); 4) RTNF plus adriamycin; or 5) BCG plus adriamycin. BCG, RTNF or adriamycin alone had no effect on tumor growth; however, BCG plus adriamycin and RTNF plus adriamycin commencing at week 13 significantly inhibited tumor growth and progression. In conclusion, this autochthonous intravesical rodent transitional cell carcinoma model appears useful for the following reasons: 1) it closely resembles human transitional cell carcinoma histologically and biologically in that all animals develop neoplastic changes in-situ that progress to muscle invasion and kill the host; 2) as with human bladder cancer these tumors do not respond to intravesical therapy if treated when tumor burden is large; however, tumor growth is inhibited when treated early; and 3) this model appears appropriate for screening and developing new intravesical treatments for superficial bladder cancer. 
4	Antithrombotic efficacy of continuous extradural analgesia after knee replacement. We have studied the effect of extradural analgesia on postoperative venous thrombosis in patients undergoing knee arthroplasty. Forty-eight patients were allocated randomly to receive either general anaesthesia or extradural analgesia with local anaesthetics for 3 days. All patients wore compressive elastic stockings and no anticoagulant drugs were administered. Bilateral venography was performed 10 days after surgery. Continuous extradural analgesia did not impede mobilization of the patients. One case of nonfatal pulmonary embolism occurred in a patient who received general anaesthesia. The use of continuous extradural analgesia resulted in a significant difference in the total incidence of deep vein thrombosis (18% compared with 59% after general anaesthesia (P = 0.02]. The incidence of calf vein thrombosis was 12% compared with 45% after general anaesthesia (P = 0.05). 
1	Breast cancer: the military's experience at Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center. We reviewed the experience with breast cancer at Wilford Hall USAF Medical Center for the years 1978 through 1988. A total of 868 cases were identified in the Wilford Hall Tumor Registry; overall 5-year and 10-year survivals were 63% and 39%, respectively. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma represented the principal histologic category. The other predominant variants included invasive lobular carcinoma, lobular carcinoma in situ, and ductal carcinoma in situ. Until recently, most of these patients (90%) had modified radical mastectomy as their definitive surgical therapy, with chemotherapy reserved primarily for patients with advanced disease. 
5	1990 AcroMed Award in basic science. Cauda equina anatomy. II: Extrathecal nerve roots and dorsal root ganglia. Inconsistent data exist regarding the anatomy of the spinal nerve roots lateral to the thecal sac. A newly developed in situ technique was used to precisely define anatomic parameters on 20 fresh human cadavers. The take-off angle of the nerve roots from the thecal sac decreases from a mean of approximately 40 degrees from L1-L5 to 22 degrees at S1. The motor bundles are directly ventral to the sensory fibers within individual roots extrathecally. Dorsal root ganglia size varies with vertebral level. The majority of ganglia lie directly beneath the vertebral pedicles and one third overlie a portion of the lateral intervertebral disc. These previously undescribed relationships may aid in the understanding of lumbosacral neurocompressive disorders and are important to note during pedicle screw insertion, posterolateral decompression for spinal trauma, and paravertebral approaches for lateral disc herniations. 
1	Haemangiopericytoma of the temporal bone. Haemangiopericytoma is an uncommon vascular tumour with a widespread distribution. Although meningeal involvement is well recognized, only a few sporadic cases of temporal bone lesions have been documented, all with doubtful sites of origin. Late presentation together with the restrictive anatomy of this region often precludes its effective removal and even minimal residual disease may progress rapidly. A series of three such patients are presented in order to discuss the natural history, histological features and treatment of this disease. 
2	Putative mechanisms of cytoprotective effect of certain antacids and sucralfate. An investigation of cytoprotective activity of certain antacids and inert particles was carried out by treating ethanol-induced gastric mucosal damage in rats in order to clarify possible mechanisms by which aluminum-containing antacids act. Al(OH)3 inhibited gastric mucosal damage in a dose-related and time-dependent manner. Neither aluminum ions themselves nor the particle size of the Al(OH)3 complex were responsible for the observed cytoprotection, since neither AlCl3, chemically inert Al2O3*C, nor sea sand showed protective effects. Hyperosmolality in the gastric lumen was not a deciding factor in inducing cytoprotection. Silicic acid and titanium dioxide, with superficial charge similar to Al(OH)3 proved to be effective in inhibiting gastric hemorrhagic lesions and releasing PGE2, suggesting that the surface charge of Al(OH)3 may be important in its cytoprotective properties. The same may also be valid for sucralfate. Since antacid-induced cytoprotection was only partly reduced by pretreatment with indomethacin, it is likely that additional mechanisms and mediators other than prostaglandins, such as nonprotein sulfhydryls, also are involved in gastric cytoprotection arising from aluminum-containing antacids. 
4	Association of pneumothorax and hypotension with intraventricular haemorrhage. To test the hypothesis that acute hypotension resulting from pneumothorax would be associated with severe brain injury (grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage), 67 very low birthweight (VLBW) infants of 32 weeks' gestation or less with respiratory distress syndrome and pneumothorax were studied. Thirty six had pneumothorax associated with systemic hypotension and 31 had pneumothorax with normal blood pressure. The groups were similar in gestational age and severity of their respiratory distress syndrome. Thirty two of 36 of infants with pneumothorax associated with hypotension (89%) had grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage. This percentage was significantly greater than the percentage for infants with pneumothorax and normal blood pressure (three of 31, 10%). The risk ratio for grade 3 or 4 intraventricular haemorrhage for infants with pneumothorax associated with hypotension was 9.8 compared with neonates with pneumothorax and normal blood pressure. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion are important factors leading to intraventricular haemorrhage in VLBW infants. 
4	Efficacy of percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty with the inoue balloon. Percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty has become an accepted technique for use in selected patients with severe, symptomatic mitral stenosis. Recently, a new balloon catheter with an "hourglass" shape and specially designed guidewires and dilators has become available (Inoue balloon). The design of this balloon provides ease of manipulation and self-stabilization across the mitral valve during inflation. These features should decrease the incidence of complications associated with the procedure. Preliminary results in 12 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty with the Inoue balloon are presented. The mitral valve area increased from 0.92 +/- 0.21 cm2 before the procedure to 1.75 +/- 0.40 cm2 after the procedure. No complications occurred from the procedure, including no increase in severity of mitral regurgitation or creation of an atrial septal defect. Further follow-up is necessary to determine the long-term efficacy with this new balloon. Nonetheless, the preliminary results are encouraging. 
2	Cathepsins D and E in normal, metaplastic, dysplastic, and carcinomatous gastric tissue: an immunohistochemical study. Immunohistochemical distributions of cathepsins D and E were determined in normal mucosa, metaplastic, dysplastic, and cancerous lesions of the human stomach. Cathepsins D and E were localised in the foveolar epithelium and parietal cells of the normal gastric mucosa, but their intracytoplasmic distributions were different - cathepsin E distribution was even and diffuse in the cytoplasm while cathepsin D was found in coarse intracytoplasmic granules. Chronic inflammation and ulcer did not influence the distribution of these enzymes. No positive staining was obtained in the incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumour cells of signet ring cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, however, gave strong and diffuse stainings for cathepsins D and E in the cytoplasm. The results suggest that the distribution of cathepsins D and E is related to each specialised function of the foveolar epithelium and the parietal cells, and that their disappearance is associated with development of well differentiated adenocarcinoma from intestinal metaplasia. 
4	Parenteral illegal drug use and limb loss. The problem of illegal drug abuse and extremity loss was identified in 27 patients-22 men and 5 women, with a mean age of 26 years. Associated medical problems included: smoking in 27, cardiac disease in 2, diabetes in 3, and hypertension in 3. Six femoral pseudoaneurysms, 2 with distal emboli and all with sepsis and thrombosis, directly contributed to limb loss along with 2 patients with progressive phlegmasia dolens. There were 3 below-the-elbow, 7 above-the-knee, 11 below-the-knee, and 6 transmetatarsal amputations. Eight patients received prostheses; 8 patients subsequently died in follow-up. 
5	Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome. A multisystem mitochondrial disorder in infancy. Pearson's marrow-pancreas syndrome (McKusick No. 26056) is a fatal disorder of hitherto unknown etiology involving the hematopoietic system, exocrine pancreas, liver, and kidneys. The observation of high lactate/pyruvate molar ratios in plasma and abnormal oxidative phosphorylation in lymphocytes led us to postulate that Pearson's syndrome belongs to the group of mitochondrial cytopathies. Since rearrangements of the mitochondrial genome between direct DNA repeats were consistently found in all tissues tested, our results show that this disease is in fact a multisystem mitochondrial disorder, as suggested by the clinical course of the patients. Based on these observations, we would suggest giving consideration to the hypothesis of a defect of oxidative phosphorylation in elucidating the origin of other syndromes, especially those associated with an abnormal oxidoreduction status in plasma. 
4	Embolization of a giant renal arterial aneurysm. A 49-year-old man presented with right flank pain. Angiography revealed a giant right renal arterial aneurysm. Giant renal arterial aneurysms are typically treated by nephrectomy. In this patient the aneurysm was embolized successfully with multiple Gianturco-Wallace coils and polyvinyl alcohol. This case indicates that embolization may be a reasonable alternative to nephrectomy. 
2	Outpatient laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy has been performed clinically in the United States since 1988. After refinement of the technique, the procedure was offered on an outpatient basis. Eighty-three patients underwent laparoscopic laser cholecystectomy during the study period. Thirty-seven (45%) had the procedure as an outpatient. Younger patients were more suited for the outpatient procedure and those without previous surgery were more likely to have the procedure done as an outpatient. Weight, operating time, and gallbladder pathology were similar, although patients with acute inflammation of the gallbladder were more likely to require hospitalization. The primary reason for patient admission was patient preference. 
5	Intrathecal immunoglobulin M synthesis in multiple sclerosis. Relationship with clinical and cerebrospinal fluid parameters. Intrathecal IgM synthesis was assessed through the detection of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and through calculation of IgM index values and total CSF IgM amounts. Intrathecal production of IgM was then evaluated along with other CSF parameters and clinical variables in 150 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Intrathecal production of IgM was detected in 55% of patients and was found to correlate with disease activity, manifesting as a recent relapse, as well as the total number of relapses. An inverse correlation was found between CSF oligoclonal IgM and both the time interval between the last relapse and lumbar puncture, and duration of the disease process. It also correlated with the number of leucocytes, free kappa and lambda light chain bands in CSF. No correlation was found between intrathecal IgM synthesis and degree of disability (Kurtzke scale), disease progression index (Poser scale), or total cerebral plaque burden (detected by enhanced CT and MRI scans). Oligoclonal IgM bands were found to be more specific for active disease process than either IgM index or total CSF IgM amount. It is concluded that intrathecal synthesis of IgM, as detected by CSF oligoclonal bands, is a useful parameter in monitoring disease relapse activity in MS. 
2	Chylous ascites due to sarcoidosis. A 33-yr-old black female with systemic sarcoidosis developed chylous ascites. A CT scan showed extensive mesenteric lymphadenopathy. At laparotomy, the mesenteric and para-aortic lymph nodes were enlarged and diffusely matted. Histologically, normal lymph node morphology was virtually replaced with noncaseating granulomas. Corticosteroids and dietary manipulations were unsuccessful in managing the ascites, and repeated large-volume paracentesis was necessary to provide symptomatic treatment. This is the first reported case of chylous ascites caused by sarcoidosis. 
1	Defining the role of subtotal colectomy in the treatment of carcinoma of the colon. Seventy-two patients with colon cancer were treated by primary subtotal colectomy, including 23 patients with acute and subacute left colon obstruction. There were two operative deaths and no cases of disabling diarrhea. One death occurred in the group with colon obstruction. Other indications for subtotal colectomy included multiple polyps associated with the primary tumor (32), synchronous carcinomas (15), a previous transverse colostomy for obstruction (8), associated severe sigmoid diverticular disease (2), age less than 50 years with a positive family history (3), adherence of the sigmoid loop to a cecal tumor (2), and metachronous carcinoma (2). There were multiple indications in several patients. Subtotal colectomy has a defined role in a wide variety of clinical settings associated with colon cancer, including management of obstruction of the left and sigmoid colon, particularly if the proximal colon cannot be evaluated before operation by colonoscopy or barium enema. Segmental or regional colonic resections are appropriate if the entire colon can be evaluated before operation and no associated neoplasms are revealed. 
5	Long term follow-up of descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral bypass. A prospective study of 26 patients undergoing descending thoracic aorto-iliac/femoral (DTAI/F) bypass was conducted over a 13-year period with an average follow up of 53 months. Reasons for selecting the procedure were occluded aortic bifurcation grafts (9 patients), hostile abdomen (6), infected aortic graft (1), microaorta (10, and surgeons preference in 8 patients who had juxtarenal aortic occlusion. The operative mortality was 3.8% (1 patient). A late mortality of 36% was due to myocardial infarction (1), lung carcinoma (2), renal failure (4), stroke (1) and pulmonary insufficiency (1). Graft failure occurred in 4 patients at 23, 26, 54 and 109 months respectively. Primary cumulative patency was 86% statistically valid at 42 months. DTAI/F bypass is recommended in selected patients when conventional approaches to the aorta are considered unduly hazardous. 
4	In vitro and in vivo evaluation of a right ventricular assist device. A simple right ventricular assist device (RVAD) has been developed. This device will be useful in situations where biventricular failure has been partially treated by placement of a left ventricular assist device, or when right ventricular failure occurs in isolation. This pneumatically actuated, R-wave synchronized, sac type pump contains no valves, and is connected by a graft to the pulmonary artery. The RVAD was tested in a circulation simulator to verify its hemodynamic efficacy and then implanted in six calves for 2-4 weeks to evaluate its biocompatibility. In vitro testing of the RVAD demonstrated that it restored normal hemodynamics in the presence of severe simulated RVF. In six animal implantations, a small amount of thrombus was found in one pump. No anticoagulants were employed. Thrombus was present in the connecting graft in three animals; in two this was clearly related to technical implant errors. No evidence of significant hemolysis was found. This simple RVAD has been found to be hemodynamically effective, is simple to use, and is well tolerated. Refinements in the interconnection graft between the pulmonary artery and the device are necessary. 
1	Immunoscintigraphy of ovarian cancer with indium-111-labeled OV-TL 3 F(ab')2 monoclonal antibody. The safety and diagnostic accuracy of immunoscintigraphy with the indium-111-labeled monoclonal antibody OV-TL 3 F(ab')2(111In-OV-TL 3 F(ab')2) for diagnosis and follow-up of ovarian cancer was prospectively studied in 31 patients. Planar and SPECT scintigraphy were performed up to 4 days after i.v. injection of 140 MBq 111In-OV-TL 3 F(ab')2. Surgical evaluation was possible in 22 out of 31 patients. Imaging results were compared with X-ray computed tomography, ultrasound, and CA 125 serum level using the histologically confirmed surgical findings as a "gold standard." Apart from a transient rash observed in two patients, no other immediate or delayed adverse reactions were observed. Within the surgically evaluated group, ovarian cancer lesions were detected in 16 out of 17 patients (94%). Of 45 distinct tumor deposits found at operation, 67% were detected and localized with immunoscintigraphy while X-ray computed tomography and ultrasound visualized 53% and 23%, respectively. 
2	Obesity and colorectal adenomatous polyps. Obesity has been investigated as a risk factor for various malignancies, including colon cancer. A case-control study was conducted on patients in three colonoscopy practices in New York City to determine possible risk factors for colorectal adenomatous polyps, a known precursor lesion for most cases of colorectal cancer. Among 301 case subjects with incidence adenomatous polyps (174 men and 127 women) and 506 control subjects (223 men and 283 women), an increased risk was observed with increasing body mass index in women (odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.0; for highest versus lowest quartile, linear trend P = .02). A nonsignificant trend was observed for men. The increased risk seen in women is consistent with prior observations regarding reproductive hormonal and dietary risk factors for colorectal cancer. 
5	Endotoxemia in human septic shock. To evaluate the incidence, pattern and clinical importance of endotoxemia in septic shock, frequent, serial endotoxin determinations were made prospectively in patients with shock. Detectable endotoxin occurred in 43 of 100 patients with septic shock, but in only one of ten patients with shock due to nonseptic causes. During septic shock, endotoxemia frequently occurred in the absence of Gram-negative bacteremia. Using a logistic regression model, multiple organ failure occurred 10.3 times more frequently and depression of left ventricular ejection fraction (less than or equal to 45 percent) 4.8 times more frequently in endotoxemic patients. In patients with positive blood cultures, endotoxemia was associated with a high mortality. We conclude that endotoxemia occurs frequently in septic shock and is associated with severe manifestations of this syndrome, including cardiac depression and multiple organ failure. This study suggests that endotoxin is an important mediator of septic shock and supports efforts to develop anti-endotoxin therapies for treating patients with this disease. 
5	A clinical study of acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage associated with various shock states. Gastrointestinal hemorrhage from stress ulceration is a life-threatening complication in a critically ill patient. We retrospectively studied 471 patients admitted to the Department of Traumatology of our hospital who developed shock in their clinical course. Forty-two patients (8.9%) developed gastrointestinal hemorrhage, most within 1 wk (76.2%). The hemorrhage lesion usually was located in the corpus of the stomach. The mortality rate of the shock patients with gastrointestinal hemorrhage was 33.3% (14 of 42). Comparison of different types of shock showed that the incidence, severity, and mortality rates of gastrointestinal hemorrhage were significantly higher in septic shock patients than in hemorrhagic shock patients. These findings show the importance of preventive therapy against progression of early mucosal damage and development of gastrointestinal hemorrhage in shock patients, especially those with sepsis. 
5	Audit of results of operations for infantile pyloric stenosis in a district general hospital Because of the proposal that infants with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis should only be treated by surgeons with an interest in paediatric surgery, we carried out a retrospective study to audit our experience in a district general hospital. Forty six infants over a five year period underwent pyloromyotomy. There were no deaths, and 36 infants (78%) made uneventful recoveries. Perforation of the duodenal mucosa occurred during the operation in 11 patients, and eight complications developed in six of these infants. There were seven wound infections, and two patients had vomiting that lasted four days or longer after their operations. There were no long term feeding problems. The results of this study show that such patients can be successfully treated in district general hospitals, and three areas merit special attention: meticulous surgical technique, the use of prophylactic antibiotics, and early graduated feeding. 
3	A follow-up study of intractable seizures in childhood. One hundred forty-five children with seizures that were refractory to medical therapy for at least 2 years were followed 5 to 20 years after onset. The majority of children with uncontrollable seizures (61%) were mentally retarded, and most of these (73%) had onset of seizures at younger than 2 years of age. Age of onset was significantly later (mean 5.0 +/- 0.5 yr [SEM]) in the group of children with borderline to normal intelligence. Follow-up data showed remission of seizures in a significant proportion of children with borderline or normal intelligence, with a linear decrease of the percentage with persistent seizures at a rate of about 4% per year. Remission of seizures was much less frequent (1.5%/yr) in the group with mental retardation. Seizure type had some effects on outcome. Children with focal atrophic brain lesions did no worse than those without definable pathology on brain-imaging studies. 
3	Influence of preservation or perfusion of intraoperatively identified spinal cord blood supply on spinal motor evoked potentials and paraplegia after aortic surgery. Permanent ligation of arteries supplying blood to the spinal cord in operations for aortic aneurysm can lead to spinal cord ischemia, which can result in either paraparesis or paraplegia. This report describes a rapid method of intraoperative identification of those arteries that supply the spinal cord by use of an intrathecal platinum electrode to detect hydrogen in solution that has been injected into the aortic ostia. Preservation or perfusion of those identified arteries supplying the spinal cord may decrease the rate of postoperative neurologic complications. Of 28 porcine experiments with postoperative observation for 24 hours, there were 3 initial pilot experiments in which saline saturated with hydrogen was injected into the temporarily cross-clamped aorta. Twenty animals were then randomized to (1) preservation of only the vessels sequentially identified to supply blood to the spinal cord from T-13 to L-5 (n = 10); (2) division of the vessels supplying the spinal cord (n = 10). A further five animals underwent perfusion experiments wherein the identified cord arteries were perfused by a shunt, the other nonsupply arteries were divided, and the aorta was kept clamped for 45 minutes. Spinal motor evoked potentials were elicited with an intrathecal electrode and were highly sensitive for paralysis. Paralysis occurred in 0/3 pilot (p less than 0.013 vs division); 8/10 division; 1/10 preservation (p less than 0.0017 vs division); and perfusion 1/5 (p less than 0.025 vs division). Results of a pilot study in eight humans shows that the technique can be used to rapidly identify segmental arteries supplying the spinal cord, to determine if distal perfusion is supplying the spinal cord with blood flow, and if reattached segmental arteries are patent. 
1	The unique aspects of acute promyelocytic leukemia. Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) accounts for approximately 10% of cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Distinctive features of this disorder at the time of diagnosis include leukopenia coexisting with a marrow replaced with granulated dysplastic promyelocytes, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, lack of Ia (HLA-DR) antigen expression, and translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 15 and 17 (t[15;17]). Heparin is widely but not universally used to interfere with the coagulopathy during the initial phases of treatment. Serial bone marrow examinations during the induction period demonstrate the achievement of remission despite the persistence of malignant-appearing promyelocytes. Patients with APL are generally younger than those with other subtypes of AML, have a 70% to 80% likelihood of entering remission, and are thought to have a more favorable prognosis than other individuals with AML. Remission may be achieved with a conventional anthracycline-cytarabine combination, anthracycline alone, or, apparently, all-trans retinoic acid. Genes potentially important in myeloid differentiation such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and myeloperoxidase are located close to the breakpoint in the t(15;17) but have not been conclusively shown to be rearranged in the translocation. A better understanding of the unique aspects of APL may well shed light on the pathogenetic processes of AML. 
4	Coronary artery bypass grafting in a patient with cryoglobulinemia. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in a patient with cryoglobulinemia. In order to decrease the concentration of cryoglobulin, the patient underwent double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) pre- and postoperatively as well as during cardiopulmonary bypass. Bypass surgery was performed under total cardiopulmonary bypass, moderate systemic hypothermia, and ventricular fibrillation without aortic crossclamping. No adverse effects of cryoglobulin appeared during the peri- and postoperative course. Technical considerations for open heart surgery in patients with cryoglobulinemia are described. 
5	The tissue origin of low back pain and sciatica: a report of pain response to tissue stimulation during operations on the lumbar spine using local anesthesia. In an effort to define the origin of low back pain and sciatica, 193 patients were carefully studied using progressive local anesthesia. These patients had surgery for herniated discs, spinal stenoses, or both. Various tissues were stimulated during the performance of these lumbar spinal operations. This article discusses our observations and the results of that study. 
5	Clinicopathologic review of twelve children with nephropathy, Wilms tumor, and genital abnormalities (Drash syndrome). The clinicopathologic and radiologic features of 12 children with complete and incomplete forms of Drash syndrome are reported. Their common denominator was a nephropathy. Four had the full triad, consisting of nephropathy, Wilms tumor, and genital abnormalities; five had nephropathy and genital abnormalities, and three had nephropathy and Wilms tumor. Of the 11 children who had proteinuria, eight had the nephrotic syndrome. Of the 10 whose condition progressed to end-stage renal failure, seven were less than 3 years of age. The histologic features of Wilms tumor were favorable in all seven children, and the tumor was bilateral in three. Of the nine patients who had genital abnormalities, eight had 46,XY karyotype and either ambiguous genitalia (six patients) or normal female phenotype (two). One other patient had a normal 46,XX female karyotype and phenotype but had both mullerian and wolffian structures and a streak ovary. Nine patients had a distinct pelvicaliceal abnormality not previously reported as a feature of this syndrome. Other congenital abnormalities were aniridia, mental retardation, deafness, nystagmus, and cleft palate. This syndrome must be considered in any infant with unexplained nephropathy, particularly in young phenotypic female infants and in those children with ambiguous genitalia or Wilms tumor with an early presentation. 
5	Reconstruction of patellar tendon rupture after total knee arthroplasty with an extensor mechanism allograft. Although patellar tendon rupture after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is a rare complication, the consistently poor outcome of conventional tendon repair has convinced some to abandon such reconstruction in favor of a prospective protocol using an allograft distal extensor mechanism. The graft consists of a quadriceps tendon, a patella with a cemented prosthesis, a patellar tendon, and a tibial tubercle. Since December 1985, 13 knees in 12 patients were reconstructed using this method. Ten knees were followed for six to 51 months; five of these knees were followed for more than 24 months. Knee extension power and improved function were ultimately attained in all cases, although minimal extensor lags were present in three cases. Preoperative motion returned in all but one knee. Healing of the allograft to the host tissue was attained primarily at all of the tibial junctions. Two graft complications occurred, both in the first three months after surgery: one quadriceps junction treated by resuture failed at the one-month mark, and the other graft had to be revised for extensor weakness from rupture of the graft at the patella-patellar tendon junction, which was attributed to surgical damage to the tendon. After completion of healing to the host and rehabilitation of the knee joint, no grafts in the series failed during the course of normal daily activities. One patient fractured the allograft patella in a severe fall. The long-term durability of this construct needs to be studied further. 
4	Retrograde recanalization of an occluded posterior tibial artery by using a posterior tibial cutdown: two case reports. Recanalization of two occluded posterior tibial arteries was successfully achieved by utilizing a retrograde approach via a posterior tibial artery cutdown at the level of the ankle. Both cases were previously unsuccessfully attempted by using an antegrade approach. Thus, the choice of access vessel (arterial entry site) becomes a crucial determinant of angioplasty success. 
3	Chronic pain. Understanding of the etiology of chronic pain is growing rapidly as researchers seek to integrate physiologic and psychosocial mechanisms. When nurses assess clients with chronic pain, they should make their assessments using both verbal and nonverbal methods and realize that no one instrument is comprehensive enough to be used alone. The key to successful treatment of these difficult clients lies in the use of a comprehensive approach that takes the client seriously and integrates both physiologic and psychosocial approaches. 
4	Resistance to ischaemia of small afferent nerve fibres in diabetes mellitus. Thermal thresholds were measured in the left forearms of 26 healthy subjects and 10 patients with diabetes mellitus during ischaemic compression block. During the period when ischaemic block of large fibres caused paraesthesia and loss of touch sensation, the cold threshold rose in normals. The cold threshold was less clearly elevated and the warm perception remained unaltered by ischaemia in diabetics. These results show that not only large afferent and efferent nerve fibres but also thinly myelinated A delta and unmyelinated C fibres are resistant to ischaemia in the diabetic nerve. 
1	Radiographic microcalcification and parenchymal patterns as indicators of histologic "high-risk" benign breast disease. Breast tissue from a forensic autopsy series of 486 women (15 to 98 years of age) was studied radiographically and by histologic sampling. Prevalence of Wolfe P2/Dy parenchymal patterns decreased with age. Radiographic nonvascular microcalcification and histologic presence of marked ductal epithelial hyperplasia and lobular microcalcification increased with age. Both of these histologic parameters of increased risk for breast cancer correlated with the presence of radiographic microcalcification and Wolfe P2/Dy parenchymal pattern. The predictive value of the radiographic parameters for presence of "high-risk" proliferative fibrocystic change increased with age. 
4	Noninvasive assessment of cardiac output in children using impedance cardiography. This study evaluated the effect of intracardiac shunting on the accuracy of thoracic bioimpedance-derived cardiac output determinations. Twenty-six patients, ranging in age from 3 months to 17 years, underwent cardiac catheterization during which simultaneous Fick and impedance measurements of cardiac output were obtained. The subjects were divided into three groups: 10 children with no intracardiac shunts, nine children with predominant left-to-right intracardiac shunts, and seven children with predominant right-to-left intracardiac shunts. Positive correlations between impedance and Fick-derived cardiac output determinations were obtained in the non-shunt group (r = 0.84), with lower correlations in the left-to-right shunt group (r = 0.70). In the right-to-left shunt group, the impedance derived cardiac output correlated with Fick pulmonary flow (r = 0.82), but the variability was unacceptably large. Although further study is needed, impedance cardiography appears to have validity as a methodology in pediatric critical care and cardiovascular health research. 
4	Coarctation of the aorta and post-stenotic aneurysm formation. Despite earlier angiography, post-stenotic aneurysm of the aorta was an unexpected finding at operation in two patients with coarctation. One aneurysm was found in an intercostal artery in a 19 year old man and the other was a false aneurysm just distal to the coarctation site in a 7 year old boy. These aneurysms are fragile, apt to rupture, and difficult to diagnose preoperatively. Though local factors such as jet streams and bacterial endocarditis may influence their formation there must be an underlying generalised weakness in the arterial wall. A coarctation should not be regarded as an isolated arterial abnormality because it may be a feature of a more generalised disease. Because of the risk of rupture, which may not be prevented by antihypertensive treatment, operation should not be delayed in any age group. 
2	Volvulus of the colon. The charts of all patients with colonic volvulus at the University of Louisville Hospitals between 1983 and 1988 were reviewed. A total of 45 patients were identified, and there were 17 with cecal volvulus and 29 with sigmoid volvulus (1 had both). Two-thirds of the patients were either demented, bedridden, or used constipating drugs. Initial nonoperative decompression was achieved in 26 of 29 patients with sigmoid volvulus but in only three of nine patients in which it was attempted with cecal volvulus. Two of these recurred, and 16 of the 17 cecal volvulus patients underwent operation. One-third of the sigmoid volvulus patients had at least one recurrent episode on the index admission. Fourteen of the 29 had an operation, and half of these patients died following surgery. Fifteen sigmoid volvulus patients chosen to be treated with successive nonoperative treatment had no mortality. Mortality was higher following emergent (4 of 5) than elective (2 of 9) operation for sigmoid volvulus, and one of three died after operation for a successfully decompressed first episode. Mortality for nonoperative reduction of an early recurrence was zero of four patients, while operative mortality for recurrence was two of seven (all had successful preoperative deflation). There was no mortality or recurrence in four patients with cecal volvulus treated by cecopexy alone, but all three patients died in whom tube cecostomy was performed. Two of nine patients died following right hemicolectomy. These data suggest that if an elective operation is to be performed for sigmoid volvulus, it should be done following one or more recurrences and that nonoperative decompression can be safely performed on successive occasions. 
4	Multilevel occlusive vascular disease presenting with gangrene. The medical records of all patients subjected to lower extremity amputations during a 3-year period were reviewed. It was shown that advanced age and the presence of multiple medical problems do not predispose to higher levels of limb loss. Although diabetic patients more frequently undergo amputation because of sepsis than their nondiabetic counterparts, the diabetic state was not found to be associated with a greater likelihood of above knee (AK) procedures. Prior arterial surgery was not shown to make AK amputation more likely, but it was disconcerting to note that limb salvage was not achieved in many individuals despite patent proximal inflow revascularization procedures. This initial study showed that several presumed risk factors were not predictors of amputation level. Those patients requiring AK amputations had a greater frequency of combined segment (aortoiliac and femoropopliteal) occlusive disease than those who had successful amputations at more distal levels. A follow-up study of 41 consecutive patients presenting with tissue loss due to combined segment occlusive disease was performed. Eighteen (Group I) underwent inflow procedures only, while 23 (Group II) also underwent distal revascularization. The groups were similar with respect to age, risk factors, extent of tissue loss and sepsis. At 1 year 10 (56%) Group I and only 3 (13%) Group II patients required major amputation (P = 0.01). Distal bypass, in addition to an inflow procedure, is recommended for those who present with tissue loss due to multilevel arterial occlusion. 
2	Host response to mycobacterial infection in the alcoholic rat. Animals, chronically treated with alcohol, were inoculated with mycobacteria (bacillus Calmette-Guerin, 10.2 x 10(6) organisms) into the spleen to produce a granulomatous hepatitis. Before infection, chronic alcohol ingestion was associated with a depressed skin test response to phytohemagglutinin, 71.7% of baseline (P = 0.009). Mycobacterial (bacillus Calmette-Guerin) infection stimulated phytohemagglutinin skin test response to 417% of baseline in controls and 299% in alcoholics (P less than 0.001). The hepatic granuloma response was altered with smaller but more numerous granulomas (mean +/- SEM, 81.2 +/- 1.5 microns2 of area with a frequency of 1.8 granulomas per field in alcoholics vs. 129.8 +/- 5.71 microns2 and 1.2 granulomas per field in controls; P less than 0.001). These changes were associated with a 10-fold increase in colony-forming units per gram of liver (54.5 +/- 18.2 in alcoholics vs. 5.6 +/- 1.83 in controls; P = 0.0006). This model offers precise parameters for host response to infection and indicates that alcohol significantly impairs the clearing capacity for mycobacteria from the liver. 
1	Legislative influences on cancer care. Deficit reduction politics was a major force in policymaking in the 1980s and a pervasive fact of life in the development of health policy. The Medicare budget was habitually used to find savings for deficit reduction and reforms, such as how to address the problem of 31 to 37 million uninsured Americans, were postponed. The 101st Congress did produce major physician payment reforms and in the spring of 1990, the Pepper Commission issued its recommendations for access to care and long-term care. Less sweeping but significant proposals affecting cancer care were considered by Congress. For example, positive actions were taken on anti-smoking and food labeling proposals. Funding for the National Institutes of Health was increased, and there was a growing awareness of the threat to biomedical research presented by assaults on animal research facilities. 
5	A case of amnesia after excision of the septum pellucidum. Tumours of the septum pellucidum (SP) are rare and seldom associated with memory impairment either before or after operation. A patient is described who developed amnesia after transcallosal excision of a tumour of the SP. Radiology did not show any major lesion of the brain areas traditionally associated with amnesia. Because septal nuclei could have been damaged during surgery their possible role in memory functions is discussed. 
5	Cytokine release syndrome induced by the 145-2C11 anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in mice: prevention by high doses of methylprednisolone. The hamster mAb 145-2C11 specific for the CD3 complex of murine T lymphocytes shares many properties with OKT3, including the induction of T cell activation. In vivo, the injection of 145-2C11 entails a variety of pathologic changes in relation to the systemic release of cytokines. We tested the effects on this cytokine release syndrome of different doses of methylprednisolone (m-PDS) given at various intervals of time before the 145-2C11 mAb. The administration of high doses of m-PDS (50 mg/kg) 2 to 3 h before the mAb resulted in an almost complete inhibition of the systemic release of TNF-alpha, IL-2, and IL-6. As far as the pathologic changes are concerned, the hypothermia, the acute renal tubular necrosis, and the fatty infiltration of the liver were completely prevented whereas the hypoglycemia was only partially attenuated. The protective effect of m-PDS on the toxicity of 145-2C11 was confirmed by the reduction of the mortality rate among galactosamine-sensitized mice. The inhibition of the release of cytokines by m-PDS did not affect the immunosuppression triggered by 145-2C11 as assessed by the CTL activity against alloantigens measured 48 h after the injection of the mAb. We conclude that the administration of very high doses of glucocorticoids 2 to 3 h before 145-2C11 prevents the release of cytokines and attenuates the acute toxicity of the mAb. Similar protocols could allow mitigation of the cytokine-release syndrome induced by the OKT3 mAb in man. 
4	High incidence of cardiopulmonary complications associated with implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus in patients with advanced neurologic disease. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study was to examine the cardiopulmonary complications of a group of patients who had undergone implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus for treatment of neurologic disease. DESIGN: Prospective study with partially matched historical controls. SETTING: Tertiary care community medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seven patients with advanced Parkinson's disease and three patients with progressive supranuclear palsy underwent implantation of adrenal medullary tissue into the caudate nucleus. These patients were compared with respect to their cardiopulmonary complications with a control group who had undergone craniotomy and then compared with a control group who had undergone only abdominal surgery. RESULTS: In the study group, six patients developed major postoperative complications including development of large pleural effusions, lobar atelectasis, pneumonia, upper airway obstruction, and cardiac arrest. Three patients had minor complications including development of small pleural effusions, subsegmental atelectasis, purulent bronchitis, mild congestive heart failure, and atrial flutter/fibrillation. One patient had an unremarkable postoperative course. The first control group, whose only surgery was a craniotomy, had only one major complication. The second control group, the abdominal surgery control group, had one major and five minor complications. CONCLUSION: The particular neurologic disease, its severity, and the type of surgery performed appear to be causative factors in the high incidence of complications in the study group. 
1	Local failure and related complications after definitive treatment of carcinoma of the prostate by irradiation or surgery. The authors review their institution's experience with the failure of definitive treatment to achieve local tumor control and with the distant dissemination and local morbidity associated with such failure. The causes of local failure are various: incomplete resection, implantation of spilled cells, and, possibly, selective implantation of circulating tumor cells in traumatized tissues after surgery and totally or partially resistant cells, new tumors, or radiologic misses after radiation. Treatment of local failure may be prophylactic or therapeutic and differs depending on the stage of the disease. Failure to control the tumor locally in the presence of distant metastases does not alter the length of survival, but it can profoundly affect the quality of survival. 
4	Right hemothorax: an unusual presentation of ruptured aortic dissection. This report presents the case of a 55-year-old male with rupture of a descending thoracic aortic dissection into the right hemithorax who successfully underwent prosthetic graft replacement of the involved segment of the aorta through left thoracotomy. 
4	Synthesis of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta by arterial cells in atherosclerosis. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) has been implicated as a regulatory protein in the development and clinical sequelae of atherosclerosis. To determine which cells in the atherosclerotic plaque synthesize IL-1 in situ, the authors evaluated histologic sections of iliac arteries from cynomolgus monkeys using probes for IL-1 alpha and beta. A polyclonal antibody to IL-1 alpha and beta was used to determine if proteins were concomitantly produced. The predominant cells expressing IL-1 alpha and beta mRNA were foam cells in the intima. Adherent leukocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) expressed mRNA for IL-1 alpha. Microvascular endothelium expressed mRNA for both IL-1 alpha and beta. IL-1 proteins were located frequently in cells expressing IL-1 mRNA. These results indicate that endothelium and VSMCs, in conjunction with macrophages, serve as localized sources of IL-1 protein synthesis. These findings suggest that vascular cells may contribute directly to the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular disease by actively secreting potent biologic mediators that modify vascular and immune cell function. 
5	Prevention of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism after total hip replacement. Comparison of low-molecular-weight heparin and unfractionated heparin. In a prospective, randomized, double-blind study, the efficacy and safety of a low-molecular-weight heparin were compared with those of unfractionated sodium heparin (standard heparin) in 136 patients who had elective total hip replacement. The patients received subcutaneous injection of either 5000 international units of low-molecular-weight heparin once daily or 5000 international units of standard heparin three times a day. Treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin began twelve hours before the operation, and treatment with standard heparin began two hours preoperatively; both regimens were continued for ten days. Twelve days postoperatively, bilateral ascending phlebography was performed in 122 patients, sixty-three in the treatment group that received low-molecular-weight heparin and fifty-nine in the treatment group that received standard heparin. Pulmonary scintigraphy was performed in 127 patients. Deep-vein thrombosis was diagnosed in forty-four patients: nineteen (30 per cent) of the sixty-three who received low-molecular-weight heparin and twenty-five (42 per cent) of the fifty-nine who received standard heparin. All but four patients, two from each treatment group, were asymptomatic. The difference in the total rate of thrombosis in the two groups was not significant (p = 0.189). However, thrombosis occurred in the thigh in only six (10 per cent) of the patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin but in eighteen (31 per cent) of those who received standard heparin, a significant difference (p = 0.011). Pulmonary embolism was detected in twenty-seven patients: eight (12.3 per cent) of those who received low-molecular-weight heparin and nineteen (30.6 per cent) of those who received standard heparin. Only three patients had clinical signs of embolism. Pulmonary embolism was significantly more frequent in the group that received standard heparin (p = 0.016). Total loss of blood and the total amount of blood that was transfused were significantly reduced in the patients who received low-molecular-weight heparin compared with those who received standard heparin. Prophylaxis was not discontinued because of hemorrhage in any patient. The efficacy of low-molecular-weight heparin was superior to that of standard heparin in the prevention of femoral thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, although the over-all incidence of deep-vein thrombosis was not statistically different.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
1	DNA ploidy pattern in rectal carcinoid tumors. The nuclear DNA pattern of 22 rectal carcinoids was determined by cytophotometry of paraffin embedded tissues. The results were compared with clinical as well as histopathologic features of the tumor. Three of the carcinoids with synchronous or metachronous metastasis had aneuploid DNA pattern, whereas 19 tumors with no metastasis showed diploid DNA pattern. No other single clinical or pathologic feature of the tumor could predict more accurately the malignant potential and the subsequent course of the rectal carcinoid. It is concluded that DNA aneuploidy in rectal carcinoid tumors is not so rare as indicated by earlier studies and that it is a factor of significant prognostic value. 
1	Positive selection of candidate tumor-suppressor genes by subtractive hybridization. A positive selection system designed to identify and recover candidate tumor-suppressor genes is described. The system compares mRNA expression of genes from normal and tumor-derived human mammary epithelial cells grown in a special medium that supports similar growth rates of the two cell types. mRNAs uniquely expressed in normal cells are recovered as cDNAs after subtraction with mRNA from tumor cells. Seven different clones, from 0.6 to 4.8 kilobases in transcript size and including both rare and abundunt transcripts, were recovered in the first 23 clones analyzed. Among the isolated clones were genes encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26, two different keratins, and glutathione-S-transferase pi, as well as an unknown gene in the S100 family of small calcium-binding proteins. In principle, tumor-suppressor genes include two classes: class I, in which loss of function results from mutation or deletion of DNA and class II, in which loss of function is from a regulatory block to expression. A class II suppressor gene is assumed to be regulated by a different suppressor gene that lost its function by mutation or deletion. Both classes of tumor-suppressor genes may provide valuable proteins with clinical applications in cancer diagnosis or therapy. Class II suppressors may be especially useful because the normal genes are present and their reexpression may be inducible by drugs or other treatments. 
3	Radical intracapsular removal of acoustic neurinomas. Long-term follow-up review of 11 patients. Historically, the neurosurgical treatment of large acoustic neurinomas has developed with two principal goals: complete tumor removal and preservation of facial nerve function. A recent goal for small tumors is the preservation of hearing. Out of a personal series of 124 acoustic neurinomas treated over the past 35 years, the senior author has undertaken a radical intracapsular approach in 12 patients with large tumors (greater than 3 cm in diameter). Surgical indications for intracapsular removal included advanced age (five cases), the patient's wish to avoid any risk of facial paralysis (six cases), contralateral facial palsy (one case), and contralateral deafness (one case). Eleven of these 12 patients were available for follow-up review. Tumor recurrence developed in two patients (18%) at 2 and 3 years postoperatively; there were no late recurrences. Four patients died of unrelated causes, 10 to 19 years after surgery. The remaining five patients have survived a mean of 12 years since surgery without recurrence (range 3 to 22 years). Facial function was preserved in nine patients (82%). The results suggest that radical intracapsular removal may be the procedure of choice under certain circumstances and may offer an alternative to focused high-energy radiation. 
1	Characterization of a factor-dependent acute leukemia cell line with translocation (3;3)(q21;q26). A strictly factor-dependent cell line (UCSD/AML1) was established from a patient with the syndrome of multilineage acute leukemia with high platelets. The patient's cells and the cell line karyotype were 45,XX,-7,t(3;3)(q21;q26), typical of the syndrome of acute leukemia with high platelets. The cell line expresses CD34, CD7, TdT, and myeloid (CD13, CD14, CD33) and megakaryocyte/platelet (CD36, CD41, CD42b, CDw49b) antigens. In short-term culture, UCSD/AML1 cells proliferate in response to interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-4, IL-6, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), but not IL-1, IL-2, IL-5, or G-CSF. In long-term culture, proliferation can be sustained by GM-CSF, IL-6, or M-CSF. When maintained in GM-CSF, a small percentage of cells form multinucleated megakaryocyte-like giant cells. Culture with GM-CSF combined with IL-6, but not with IL-6 alone, increased giant cell formation fourfold to sevenfold. IL-6 alone or in combination with GM-CSF increased expression of platelet-related antigens. In contrast, culture with phorbol ester induced formation of macrophage-like cells. UCSD/AML1 is the first human acute nonlymphocytic leukemia cell line established from a patient with an acute leukemia syndrome associated with a specific chromosome abnormality. 
5	Effects of glucose on hypoxic vasoconstriction in isolated ferret lungs. To characterize the effects of glucose on the pulmonary vascular response to anoxia and hypoxia, isolated ferret lungs were ventilated with 28% O2 and 5% CO2 and perfused at constant flow (100 ml.kg-1.min-1). Perfusate glucose concentrations were allowed to fall spontaneously to less than 1 mM (low glucose) or were controlled at 5-6 mM (normal glucose) or 12-17 mM (high glucose). At 60, 120, and 180 min of perfusion, the inspired O2 tension (PIO2) was reduced to 0, 10, or 30 Torr for 30 min, and vasomotor responses were quantified by continuous measurement of pulmonary arterial pressure. At PIO2 of 0 Torr, the response consisted of an early phase of transient intense vasoconstriction and a late phase of sustained slight vasoconstriction. High glucose markedly potentiated the magnitude of late-phase vasoconstriction with each successive anoxic exposure. This effect was not reproduced in normal glucose lungs and was not caused by a change in perfusate osmolarity, an action on blood cells, or an altered ability of pulmonary vascular smooth muscle to contract. At PIO2 of 10 Torr, high glucose not only potentiated late-phase vasoconstriction but also slowed the onset of early-phase vasoconstriction. At PIO2 of 30 Torr, high glucose had no effect on vasomotor responses, which were characterized by a slowly developing sustained vasoconstriction. Our results suggest that the vascular response of isolated ferret lungs to severe hypoxia consisted of separate early and late phases of vasoconstriction. This biphasic response may have resulted from two distinct vasoconstrictor mechanisms or from modulation of a single vasoconstrictor mechanism by a secondary vasodilator influence. 
3	Magnetic resonance imaging in neurological disorders. To investigate the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in neurological disorders, 115 children were studied in two groups. Group A (78 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography and MRI cranial scans. Group B (37 patients) was studied by paired computed tomography assisted myelography (CTM) and MRI spinal scans. In group A, the scans were generally equivalent for supratentorial tumours and for investigating fits, hydrocephalus, benign intracranial hypertension, and cerebral atrophies, but MRI scanning was superior for posterior fossa tumours and cysts. In group B, MRI scans were superior for intramedullary spinal tumours, spinal dysraphic problems with tethering or syrinx, and were complementary to CTM in diastematomyelia. 
1	Cancer in populations living near nuclear facilities. A survey of mortality nationwide and incidence in two states. Reports from the United Kingdom have described increases in leukemia and lymphoma among young persons living near certain nuclear installations. Because of concerns raised by these reports, a mortality survey was conducted in populations living near nuclear facilities in the United States. All facilities began service before 1982. Over 900,000 cancer deaths occurred from 1950 through 1984 in 107 counties with or near nuclear installations. Each study county was matched for comparison to three "control counties" in the same region. There were 1.8 million cancer deaths in the 292 control counties during the 35 years studied. Deaths due to leukemia or other cancers were not more frequent in the study counties than in the control counties. For childhood leukemia mortality, the relative risk comparing the study counties with their controls before plant start-up was 1.08, while after start-up it was 1.03. For leukemia mortality at all ages, the relative risks were 1.02 before start-up and 0.98 after. For counties in two states, cancer incidence data were also available. For one facility, the standardized registration ratio for childhood leukemia was increased significantly after start-up. However, the increase also antedated the operation of this facility. The study is limited by the correlational approach and the large size of the geographic areas (counties) used. It does not prove the absence of any effect. If, however, any excess cancer risk was present in US counties with nuclear facilities, it was too small to be detected with the methods employed. 
5	Buruli ulcer in Benin In a study of 28 patients with Mycobacterium ulcerans infection (Buruli ulcer) in Oinhi, Benin, it became clear that the disease can regress as well as progress, and that patients can have lesions of different stages simultaneously. A system of disease staging was introduced (I = subcutaneous nodule; II = cellulitis; III = ulceration; IV = scar formation). Research to find an effective treatment for this crippling disease is urgently needed. 
5	Essential fatty acid deficiency ameliorates acute renal dysfunction in the rat after the administration of the aminonucleoside of puromycin. The administration of the aminonucleoside of puromycin (PAN) to rats causes the nephrotic syndrome that is associated with an acute decline in renal function, and an interstitial infiltrate. We examined whether essential fatty acid deficiency (EFAD), which inhibits macrophage infiltration in glomerulonephritis, affects PAN-induced renal dysfunction. Both control and EFAD rats developed proteinuria that resolved over 28 d. After PAN administration, there was a prominent infiltration of macrophages in rats fed a normal diet. The infiltrate was prevented by the EFAD diet. The absence of a macrophage interstitial infiltrate was associated with a significantly higher Cin in the EFAD rats than in controls at 7 d (5.21 +/- 1.19 versus 0.39 +/- 0.08, P less than 0.002 ml/min/kg BW). In addition, CPAH fell to less than 10 ml/min/kg BW by day 7 in controls, but remained the same as normal in the EFAD. After administration of PAN to control rats, there was no increase in urinary thromboxane excretion or an increase in glomerular thromboxane production. Furthermore, the effect of EFAD could not be mimicked by the administration of a thromboxane synthase inhibitor. Irradiation-induced leukopenia in rats on a normal diet markedly improved glomerular filtration and renal blood flow in acutely nephrotic rats. EFAD prevents the interstitial cellular infiltrate and the renal ischemia associated with experimental nephrosis. The recruitment of mononuclear cells into the kidney following PAN directly contributes to the decline in renal function. 
5	Transformation-associated alterations in interactions between pre-B cells and fibronectin. Marrow stromal elements produce as yet uncharacterized soluble growth factors that can stimulate the proliferation of murine pre-B cells, although close contact between these two cell types appears to ensure a better pre-B cell response. We have now shown that freshly isolated normal pre-B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu- fraction of adult mouse bone marrow) adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site, as shown in a serum-free adherence assay, and they lose this functional ability on differentiation in vivo into B cells (ie, the B220+, surface mu+ fraction). Similarly, cells from an immortalized but stromal cell-dependent and nontumorigenic murine pre-B cell line originally derived from a Whitlock-Witte culture were also found to adhere to fibronectin (FN) via an RGD cell-attachment site. Moreover, in the presence of anti-FN receptor antibodies, the ability of this immortalized pre-B cell line to proliferate when co-cultured with a supportive stromal cell line (M2-10B4 cells) was markedly reduced (down to 30% of control). This suggests that pre-B cell attachment to FN on stromal cells may be an important component of the mechanism by which stromal cells stimulate normal pre-B cell proliferation and one that is no longer operative to control their more differentiated progeny. Two differently transformed pre-B cell lines, both of which are autocrine, stromal-independent, tumorigenic in vivo, and partially or completely differentiation-arrested at a very early stage of pre-B cell development, did not bind to FN. In addition, anti-FN receptor antibodies were much less effective in diminishing the ability of these tumorigenic pre-B cells to respond to M2-10B4 cell stimulation, which could still be demonstrated when the tumorigenic pre-B cells were co-cultured with M2-10B4 cells at a sufficiently low cell density. Analysis of cell surface molecules immunoprecipitated from both the nontumorigenic and tumorigenic pre-B cell lines by an anti-FN receptor antibody showed an increase in very late antigen (VLA) alpha chain(s) in both tumorigenic pre-B cell lines and a decrease in the beta 1 chain in one. Interestingly, all of the pre-B cell lines expressed similar amounts of messenger RNA for the beta 1 chain of the FN receptor. These results suggest that alteration of FN receptor expression on pre-B cells may represent a mechanism contributing to the outgrowth of leukemic pre-B cells with an autocrine phenotype and capable of stromal cell-independent, autonomous growth. 
2	Rectal examination in patients with pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen OBJECTIVE--To determine whether rectal examination provides any diagnostic information in patients admitted to hospital with pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. DESIGN--Casualty officer or surgical registrar recorded symptoms and signs on admission on detailed forms. Final diagnosis was noted on discharge from hospital. SETTING--District general hospital. PATIENTS--1204 Consecutive patients admitted to hospital with pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen as their major complaint; 1028 had a rectal examination on admission. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Odds ratio for each symptom and sign related to final diagnosis. Results of multiple logistic regression analysis for acute appendicitis. RESULTS--Right sided rectal tenderness, present in 309 of those examined, was more common in patients with acute appendicitis (odds ratio 1.34, p less than 0.05). This odds ratio was considerably less than that for other clinical signs--namely, tenderness in the right lower quadrant (odds ratio 5.09), rebound tenderness (3.34), guarding (3.07), and muscular rigidity in the abdomen (5.03). In the logistic regression analysis of patients with acute appendicitis, when allowance was made for the presence or absence of rebound tenderness, rectal tenderness on the right lost its significance. Six patients had masses palpable rectally, of which three were palpable on abdominal examination; the other three patients had acute appendicitis. No other unexpected diagnoses were established, and no useful additional diagnostic information was obtained by routine rectal examination. CONCLUSION--If patients presenting with pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen are tested for rebound tenderness then rectal examination does not give any further diagnostic information. 
1	Node-negative breast cancer: prognostic subgroups defined by tumor size and flow cytometry Adjuvant systemic therapy for women with node-negative breast cancer is most easily justified for those patients at highest risk of relapse. We have examined the impact of tumor size, histologic grade, estrogen receptor (ER) status, tumor ploidy, and S-phase fraction (SPF) on relapse-free survival (RFS) for 169 patients with node-negative breast cancer in order to identify groups of patients at high and low risk of relapse. Patients with small tumors (less than or equal to 1.0 cm) had a significantly better RFS than those with larger tumors (P = .005), with 96% remaining relapse-free at 5 years. Patients with tumors less than or equal to 1.0 cm were thus excluded from analysis when attempting to define a group with a poor prognosis. Within the group of patients with tumors greater than 1.0 cm, tumor ploidy (P = .63), ER status (P = .3), or progesterone receptor (PgR) status (P = .24) did not predict for RFS. Patients with grade 1 or 2 infiltrating ductal tumors had a significantly better prognosis than those with grade 3 tumors (P = .04). The prognostic factor that gave the widest separation between subgroups, however, was SPF. Patients whose tumors were greater than 1.0 cm with an SPF less than or equal to 10% had a 5-year RFS of 78% compared with a 5-year RFS of 52% for those with an SPF greater than 10% (P = .006). We have combined tumor size and SPF to identify three prognostic groups: (1) tumor less than or equal to 1.0 cm, 5-year RFS 96%; (2) tumor greater than 1.0 cm plus SPF less than or equal to 10%, 5-year RFS 78%; 3) tumor greater than 1.0 cm plus SPF greater than 10%, 5-year RFS 52%. These prognostic groupings may help identify patients most suitable for adjuvant therapy. 
5	Stress and sudden death. The case of the long QT syndrome. The idiopathic long QT syndrome (LQTS) represents a unique clinical example of stress-related sudden cardiac death. LQTS is characterized by the association of several distinctive electrocardiographic features, among which prolongation of the QT interval is the best known, with life-threatening arrhythmias that usually occur under conditions of physical or psychological stress. Effective therapies exist and are represented by antiadrenergic interventions; beta-adrenergic-blocking agents are the treatment of choice. When they fail, left cardiac sympathetic denervation has also proven to be very effective. The latter result suggests a role for alpha-adrenergic mechanisms in the arrhythmias of LQTS. The stressors more frequently associated with syncopal events in LQTS patients include fear, exercise fraught with emotions, swimming, and awakening because of a loud noise. Experimentally, life threatening arrhythmias have been induced during a highly emotional situation in conscious cats with normal hearts in which right stellate ganglia have been ablated, resulting in QT interval prolongation. This selective denervation creates a sympathetic imbalance of the type proposed by one of the pathogenetic hypotheses for LQTS. 
3	Cosmetic, functional, independent: self-help aids. Self-help orthotics have been developed to assist functional activities for high-level spinal cord injured patients. The goal of rehabilitation has been to do this with as little intrusion on independence and cosmesis as possible. This paper describes devices to help a patient with C6 quadriplegia independently place his own utensils and eat with an almost normal appearance. The new self-help aids are made from standard silverware, a rivet, and two one-eighth-inch Kydex loops. The loops are riveted centrally on the utensil, allowing for free rotation. The device was evaluated on a patient with C6, complete quadriplegia. The subject demonstrated independence in donning and doffing the device and in eating with an almost normal appearance. 
3	Pupillary and electroretinographic abnormalities in a family with neuronal intranuclear hyaline inclusion disease. Abnormal pupillary function and a severely depressed electroretinogram were found in four members of a family with neuronal intranuclear hyaline inclusion disease, an idiopathic degenerative disorder that involves the central and peripheral nervous systems. Symptoms were limited to the gastrointestinal system and consisted principally of abdominal pain, constipation, and severe weight loss. The discovery of light-fixed pupils in the propositus led to the first antemortem diagnosis by rectal biopsy in two generations of this family. Abnormalities of gastrointestinal motility and pupillary reactions constituted the only objective evidence of autonomic dysfunction; the abnormal electroretinogram was the only evidence of central nervous system dysfunction. 
1	Oxygen-exacerbated bleomycin pulmonary toxicity Bleomycin is an antineoplastic agent with potential for producing pulmonary toxicity, attributed in part to its free radical-promoting ability. Clinical and research experiences have suggested that the risk of bleomycin-induced pulmonary injury is increased with the administration of oxygen. We report a case in which the intraoperative administration of oxygen in the setting of previous bleomycin therapy contributed to postoperative ventilatory failure. Our patient recovered with corticosteroid therapy. Physician awareness of a potential interaction between oxygen and bleomycin may help reduce the morbidity and mortality related to bleomycin therapy. 
5	Severe preeclampsia presenting as dysphonia secondary to uvular edema. A case report. In addition to hypertension and proteinuria, generalized edema is seen commonly in women with severe preeclampsia. A patient presented to us at term with the complaint of dysphonia. Upon examination she appeared to be clearly preeclamptic and had a grossly edemetous uvula, which we think occurred secondary to generalized edema. This case might be the first reported one of preeclampsia presenting as dysphonia and of uvular edema in association with preeclampsia. 
5	Isotonic high-sodium oral rehydration solution for increasing sodium absorption in patients with short-bowel syndrome. We compared the effect of a standard oral rehydration solution and a high-sodium polymeric-glucose solution on sodium absorption in short-bowel syndrome. Six patients with high jejunostomy were tested in a random order with the standard solution or a solution containing maltodextrins (18 g Glucidex 12/L) enriched with 2.5 g NaCl/L. Solutions were administered via a nasogastric tube at a rate of 2 mL/min. Jejunal effluent was collected during an 8-h period. The net 8-h fluid absorption was not significantly different in the two periods. Glucose absorption was greater than 90% of the administered amount for both solutions. Net sodium absorption was greater for the maltodextrin solution than for the standard solution (56 +/- 12 vs 24 +/- 20 mmol, P less than 0.05). We conclude that replacement of glucose with maltodextrins and addition of sodium in the standard oral rehydration solution results in improved sodium absorption in short-bowel syndrome. 
5	Acute hypercalcemic crisis after an open heart operation. Acute hyperparathyroidism developed in a previously normocalcemic 64-year-old woman during the first week after a coronary operation. Prolonged QT interval in the electrocardiogram and hypercalcemia were documented on the fourth postoperative day. Neck exploration on the fifth postoperative day revealed a lower right parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroidectomy resulted in rapid and dramatic improvement of the clinical picture and normalization of laboratory values. 
3	Transient entrapment neuropathy of the posterior interosseous nerve in violin players. Eleven white male right handed violin players complained of transient muscular deficit of the extensor compartment of the left forearm during and after prolonged playing. This was associated with paraesthesiae and pain. Relief was achieved keeping the wrist and the elbow flexed, with the supinated forearm held by the contralateral hand. An anatomical study showed changes of the relationship of the posterior interosseous nerve with its surrounding structures with pronation and supination of the forearm. On the basis of the clinical features, the anatomical studies and the response to a simple physiotherapeutic regime, it is suggested that prolonged pronation of the forearm may cause transient entrapment of the nerve. 
1	Malignant mixed tumor (malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma) of the maxilla. We present a rare case of carcinosarcoma (malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma) of the left maxilla that developed in a 63-year-old Japanese man. The tumor recurred repeatedly despite multiple surgical removals, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy and led to progressive cachexia; the patient died after 3.8 years of hospitalization. Histopathologic examination revealed that the recurrent tumor was carcinosarcoma, which had progressed from malignant ameloblastoma with fibroma. An autopsy confirmed the diagnosis of malignant mixed tumor with lung metastasis of malignant ameloblastoma and fibrosarcoma. 
5	Stroke in pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. In a 4 1/2-year period, 4 of 68 children in a longitudinal study of neurological complications of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection had clinical and/or neuroradiological evidence of stroke, yielding a clinical incidence of stroke in this population of 1.3% per year. During this period, 32 subjects died, and permission for autopsy was granted in 18 of the patients, including 3 of 4 who had clinical evidence of stroke. The prevalence of cerebrovascular pathological features in our consecutive autopsy series was higher than the clinical incidence. At autopsy cerebrovascular disease was documented in 6 (24%) of 25 children with HIV infection, including all 3 children who had clinical evidence of stroke. Four patients had intracerebral hemorrhages, 6 patients had nonhemorrhagic infarcts, and 3 had both. Hemorrhage was catastrophic in 1 child and clinically silent in 3 children, all of whom had immune thrombocytopenia. One child had an arteriopathy that affected meningocerebral arteries. In another child, the arteries of the circle of Willis were aneurysmally dilated. Two children had coexisting cardiomyopathy and subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy with vascular proliferation. These results suggest that stroke should be considered when children with HIV infection develop focal neurological signs. 
4	Interleukin-2 does not attenuate hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. It was recently reported that interleukin-2, when administered as a single bolus injection (5,000 units/kg), could prevent the development of hypertension in young spontaneously hypertensive rats and lower blood pressure to normotensive levels in spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension. Consequently, efforts were made to duplicate this finding. Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (35 days old) were injected subcutaneously with 50,000 units/kg (3,500 units/rat) of recombinant interleukin-2 (Amgen) and had systolic blood pressure measured twice weekly by the tail-cuff technique. Systolic blood pressure in the interleukin-2-treated group was not significantly different from the vehicle-treated control group at any time point over 32 days of follow-up. A second injection of recombinant interleukin-2 (5,000 units/kg) was administered 32 days after the first injection. Again, no reduction in blood pressure was observed in the interleukin-2-treated group over an additional 38 days. Mean arterial pressure (+/- SEM) measured via intra-arterial cannula in conscious rats at age 105 days (38 days after the second treatment) was 168.5 +/- 3.5 mm Hg in interleukin-2-treated spontaneously hypertensive rats and 170.3 +/- 3.6 mm Hg in vehicle-treated controls. Both recombinant interleukin-2 preparations conformed to their respective manufacturer's indicated specific activity as determined by the ability of the interleukin-2 to induce proliferation of the interleukin-2-dependent cell line HT-2. Thus, this study demonstrated that interleukin-2 was ineffective in preventing or attenuating hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats. 
2	Immune complexes in the choroid plexus in liver cirrhosis. A histopathologic and immunofluorescence study of the choroid plexus was performed in 12 cases of liver cirrhosis (cirrhosis group) and in 20 patients who died of diseases with no evidence of liver or brain involvement, and in which renal disease and alcoholism were also excluded (control group). IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, and C1q were investigated by direct immunofluorescence technique. Positive immunofluorescence in the choroid plexus was found in 83.33% of the cirrhosis group. IgA and IgG were the immunoglobulins more frequently found. C3 was also commonly found. Histologic examination of the choroid plexus showed changes in 66.67% of the cirrhosis group characterized, mainly, by subepithelial deposition of a homogeneous, acidophilic, and periodic acid-Schiff-positive substance, with thickening of the epithelial basement membrane. In the control group, the immunofluorescence in the choroid plexus was negative in all cases and only two cases (10%) presented histopathologic changes of the choroid plexus with a pattern similar to that of the cirrhosis group. 
1	Brush cytology in the diagnosis of colonic neoplasms. During a three-year period (1986-1988), 234 colonic brush specimens were received in the authors' laboratory. Nine samples (4%) were deemed unsatisfactory for evaluation because of inadequate cellularity and/or poor fixation. In 11 cases concomitant or follow-up histologic specimens were not available. The remaining 214 specimens included 82 malignant neoplasms, 88 neoplastic polyps (adenomas), and 44 nonneoplastic lesions. Sixty-seven (82%) of malignant neoplasms were correctly diagnosed by brush cytology. Three cases of adenoma with severe dysplasia or in situ carcinoma were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by cytology. No false-positive diagnoses were made of nonneoplastic lesions. Brush cytology was found to be a more sensitive technique in the diagnosis of colon cancer than endoscopic biopsy (82% and 74% sensitivity, respectively). The combination of the two techniques increased the sensitivity to 90% and improved the overall accuracy of the test. Seventy-one (82%) of the colonic adenomas were correctly diagnosed by cytology. Brush cytology is a convenient, safe, and accurate technique which should be used concurrently with endoscopic biopsy or polypectomy. 
1	Expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD54) on hematopoietic progenitors. The distribution of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a ligand for lymphocyte function antigen-1, on hematopoietic tissue was determined using the anti-ICAM-1 monoclonal antibody CL203.4 with flow cytometry and short-term semi-solid hematopoietic progenitor cultures. After timed incubation in media with fetal bovine serum, 29% of erythroid burst-forming units (BFU-E), 24% of erythroid colony-forming units (CFU-E), and 52% of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM) bone marrow progenitors expressed ICAM-1. This finding, which is consistent with the detection of ICAM-1 on acute non-lymphoblastic leukemic blasts, is at variance with recent reports. ICAM-1 was also detected on bone marrow blasts, proerythroblasts, promyelocytes, and cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage, but was not detected on erythroblasts, normoblasts, neutrophilic myelocytes, metamyelocytes, bands, or on most lymphocytes. These results indicate that maturation of cells of the erythroid and myeloid lineage is associated with loss of ICAM-1. The distribution of ICAM-1 on bone marrow progenitors, early precursor cells, and accessory cells in conjunction with the function of this molecule in cell-cell interactions suggests that ICAM-1 may play a role in the cell-cell and cell-stromal interactions that regulate hematopoiesis. 
1	Characterization and histopathological correlation of cytosol proteins of benign and malignant breast tumors. Significant differences in cytosol protein level exist between normal/benign and cancerous breast tissues. There is a positive correlation between the cytosol protein level and histological grade of carcinoma. Well-differentiated carcinoma have a lower value of cytosol protein than poorly differentiated carcinoma. In slab gel electrophoregrams, the total numbers of bands are almost identical in normal, benign, and malignant conditions. In addition, 37 Kd protein band is consistently present in malignant cases and always absent in normal or benign cases. More extensive biophysical examination of this band may provide further insight into the protein alterations in cancer cells at the molecular level. 
5	Effective endothelialization of polyurethane surfaces. Response to shear stress and platelet adhesion. Biomer and Mitrathane are thromboresistant polyurethane ureas that are suitable for coating artificial valves. Degeneration of the surface coatings, however, does occur over time, and in experimental animal studies adherent thrombi have been observed as a complication. In this study, morphometric techniques applied to scanning electron microscopy were used to assess whether vascular endothelial cells harvested from jugular veins of fetal lambs could be grown to confluence on these polyurethane surfaces, whether the monolayer would remain intact under conditions of shear stress (104 dynes/cm2), and whether this would result in decreased platelet adherence of sheep platelets relative to nonendothelialized surfaces. The results have shown that both Biomer and Mitrathane could be endothelialized: 88.8 +/- 5.1% of the Biomer surface consisted of intact confluent endothelial cells, as did 95.45 +/- 1.7% of the Mitrathane surface. After 6 hr of shear stress, a significant reduction in this feature was observed (p = 0.02), but both materials still maintained a high percentage of confluent endothelial cells (78.65% for Biomer and 85.58% for Mitrathane). After 48 hr of shear stress, however, the percent confluence was similar to control values, which suggested new cell growth. Endothelialized Biomer compared with Mitrathane had fewer adherent single platelets, or small or large aggregates (p = 0.001, p = 0.01, and p = 0.05, respectively); this feature was not affected by shear stress. Whereas endothelialization of the surface clearly decreased platelet adherence on Mitrathane (p = 0.01), only a trend was seen with Biomer. These studies therefore show that endothelialization of these polyurethane surfaces is feasible. 
5	Spontaneous pneumothorax in AIDS patients with recurrent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia despite aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis. Aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) may predispose these patients to recurrent apical Pneumocystis infection. Bullous changes and pulmonary cysts develop in the lung apices due to repeated episodes of inflammation and cytotoxic effects of HIV on pulmonary macrophages. These changes progress despite prophylaxis against recurrent Pneumocystis infection with aerosolized pentamidine, increasing the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. Two cases are presented of bilateral pneumothoraces in patients with AIDS and recurrent P carinii pneumonia despite aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis. Patients receiving aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis for Pneumocystis pneumonia appear to have an increased risk of pneumothorax due to recurrent apical infections with P carinii. 
1	Endoscopic placement of a Foley catheter across a stricture and rectovaginal fistula to perform a barium enema. Evaluation of enteric fistulas is often best performed with barium contrast studies. Clinical situations that preclude the satisfactory installation of barium decrease the yield of the study. A case is presented of a 59-yr-old female with stage III-B cervical carcinoma and a known rectovaginal fistula with an adjacent sigmoid colon stricture. An additional more proximal, enteric fistula was suspected. Definitive preoperative knowledge of the existence or absence of this fistula would have shortened the duration of a planned palliative intervention. The rectovaginal fistula and stricture precluded adequate barium and air installation for contrast study. Colonoscopy was unsuccessful. We have developed a combined technique in which the endoscopic placement of a semirigid guidewire allowed placement of a Foley catheter across the fistula and stricture. Successful barium study was performed. Intraoperative time and hospital stay were shortened. 
1	Differential diagnosis of sclerosing cholangiocarcinomas of the common hepatic duct (Klatskin tumors). Although it is recognized that some other lesion may be the cause, a presumptive diagnosis of Klatskin tumor is usually made when a focal stenotic lesion of the common hepatic duct is seen on a cholangiogram of a jaundiced patient. Biopsy is so often nondiagnostic that decisions about therapy are usually made on the basis of the imaging tests and lack of evidence for some other disease. Because the accuracy and consequences of this strategy have never been tested, we contrasted the preoperative diagnosis of Klatskin tumor with the final diagnosis in 98 consecutive patients treated from 1985 to 1990. Preoperative investigations included ultrasound and computed tomographic scans, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and angiography. Sclerosing cholangiocarcinomas of the bile duct were correctly diagnosed in 68 cases. The final diagnosis was other than a sclerosing adenocarcinoma in 30 (31%) cases. There were 5 papillary bile duct carcinomas, 12 gallbladder carcinomas invading the bile duct, 5 metastatic tumors to the bile duct, 2 cases of Mirizzi syndrome, 3 granulomas, and 3 cases of idiopathic benign focal stenosis. Patients with papillary adenocarcinomas had an extensive filling defect of the duct, which was often thought to be unresectable. However, four of these five lesions could be completely excised, and the tumor was confined to the duct wall in all four. The outcome of surgical treatment of the other eight patients with benign lesions was good in most cases. These findings demonstrate the pitfalls of assuming that a focal stenosis of the hepatic duct represents a sclerosing adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis is much less specific than is generally thought, so there is considerable opportunity for mismanaging such patients. 
5	Comparison of ambulatory left ventricular ejection fraction and blood pressure in systemic hypertension in patients with and without increased left ventricular mass. To evaluate the effects of long-standing systemic hypertension on left ventricular (LV) function during daily activities, ambulatory radionuclide monitoring of LV ejection fraction (EF) and blood pressure was performed during exercise and other structured activities in 31 hypertensive patients. Patients were divided into 3 groups based on the absence of LV hypertrophy (group 1 [n = 16], LV mass 107 +/- 12 g/m2), presence of LV hypertrophy without electrocardiographic changes (group 2 [n = 10], LV mass 141 +/- 8 g/m2) and LV hypertrophy with associated electrocardiographic changes (group 3 [n = 5], LV mass 158 +/- 9 g/m2). The groups were similar with respect to age, baseline medication, treated and untreated blood pressure, resting EF and treadmill exercise time. Patients in group 3 had the longest history of hypertension. Peak filling rate was normal in group 1 (2.9 +/- 0.4 end-diastolic volume/s), but reduced at rest in groups 2 (2.4 +/- 0.4) and 3 (2.1 +/- 0.3). Patients in group 1 had normal EF responses to exercise and mental stress testing, as well as during routine ambulatory activities. Patients in group 2 had a blunted EF response to exercise, and those in group 3 had a significantly abnormal response. Both group 2 and 3 patients demonstrated abnormal EF responses to mental stress, as well as cold pressor testing in association with significant increases in mean arterial pressure and marked reduction in diastolic filling rate. Decreases in EF were also observed during routine patient monitoring in 3 group 3 patients and 4 group 2 patients. These events were associated with significantly increased blood pressure. 
3	Paraplegia after a routine lumbar laminectomy: report of a rare complication and successful management. Arachnoid cysts of the spinal canal are relatively common lesions that may be either intra- or extradural. These cysts are usually asymptomatic but may produce symptoms by compressing the spinal cord or nerve roots. We report a case in which an intradural thoracic arachnoid cyst became symptomatic after a routine decompressive lumbar laminectomy for spinal stenosis. Myelography revealed no abnormality, although magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography after myelography demonstrated a mass within the posterior aspect of the thoracic spinal canal associated with anterior displacement and compression of the spinal cord. A change in the flow dynamics of the cerebrospinal fluid probably allowed the development of spinal cord compression due to one of the following: expansion of the cyst, decreased cerebrospinal fluid buffer between the cord and the cyst, or epidural venous engorgement. A concomitant and more cephalad lesion such as an arachnoid cyst should be considered when myelopathic complications arise after lumbar surgery. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography after myelography are useful to demonstrate the additional pathological processes. 
5	Methodological problems in evaluation of cardiovascular effects of stress in humans. Cardiovascular effects of stress in humans are often assessed by application of physical or emotional stimuli in a laboratory environment. Although this method provides important information, these procedures have several limitations. First, blood pressure and heart rate responses to laboratory stressors are characterized by a limited within-subject reproducibility. Second, there is poor correlation between blood pressure and heart rate responses to different stressors, which implies that individual reaction to stress may be estimated differently according to the test used. Finally, these responses bear only a limited relation to 24-hour or daytime blood pressure variability, that is, they reflect to only a limited extent the tendency of blood pressure to vary during daily activities. If assessed by techniques that allow blood pressure to be continuously recorded for 24 hours in ambulatory subjects, blood pressure variability represents a possible approach to observation of cardiovascular reactivity away from an artificial laboratory environment. However, whether blood pressure variability should be expressed as a percentage or in absolute values is controversial. Furthermore, although naturally occurring stress may markedly increase blood pressure, 24-hour blood pressure variations also depend on factors that are not related to emotional stimuli. Thus, the study of cardiovascular responses to stress in humans encounters several problems, regardless of the method used. 
2	Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis occurred in 30 patients; 18 (60%) presented with at least 1 pulmonary complaint and 10 (33%) had multiple pulmonary symptoms. In 14 patients (47%), abnormalities were found on examination of the chest. In 16 chest roentgenograms (53%), there was at least 1 abnormality: right-sided pleural effusion (9 patients) and elevated right hemidiaphragm (8 patients) were the most common. All patients were treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) and had resolution of the amebic liver abscess and pulmonary disease. Pleuropulmonary disease is a common complication of amebic liver abscess. The clinical presentation and chest roentgenograms are virtually diagnostic and obviate the need for invasive procedures to confirm the diagnosis. Pleuropulmonary disease resolves with amebicidal treatment of the hepatic abscess. 
5	Penile implants in the treatment of Peyronie's disease. The treatment of Peyronie's disease remains controversial. Patients who fail conservative therapy may require surgical intervention to restore the ability to have sexual intercourse. Plaque excision and dermal grafting have not been universally successful, and alternate procedures that rely on the placement of a penile prosthesis have gained in popularity. We reviewed our experience with 35 patients with advanced Peyronie's disease treated with a penile prosthesis. Preoperatively, 55% of the patients were unable to engage in intercourse due to pain or angulation of the penis and 25% were unable to achieve any erection at all. Postoperatively, with a mean followup of 6.9 years, 88% of the patients were able to engage in intercourse and were satisfied with the results obtained. In selected patients with advanced disease the implantation of a penile prosthesis remains a highly successful and satisfying alternative for the treatment of Peyronie's disease. 
4	Long-term amiodarone administration protects against global myocardial ischemia. Reports on the effects of amiodarone on cardiac function have been variable. This study addresses the effect of long-term amiodarone administration on recovery of cardiac function after a period of global ischemia. Normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats were used. Normotensive rats (n = 6) received 240 mg/kg amiodarone for 4 weeks, for a total of 72 +/- 3 mg. Hypertensive rats (n = 6) received 500 mg/kg amiodarone for 4 weeks, for a total of 116 +/- 5 mg. Final myocardial concentrations of amiodarone and desethylamiodarone were 1.85 +/- 1.75 and 0.50 +/- 0.61 micrograms/g wet weight for the normotensive rats and 1.30 +/- 0.58 and 0.31 +/- 0.17 micrograms/g for the hypertensive rats (p = nonsignificant). Equal numbers of controls received sterile saline solution for 4 weeks. The hearts were excised and perfused in a Langendorff apparatus. The results indicate that, after 15 minutes of normothermic ischemia, hearts treated with this relatively low dose of amiodarone recovered a greater percentage of preischemic work (97% +/- 13%) as compared with the controls (76% +/- 17%) (p less than 0.005). 
5	MIC2 is a specific marker for Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors. Evidence for a common histogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors from MIC2 expression and specific chromosome aberration. This study reports on the specific expression of the MIC2 gene, a pseudoautosomal gene located on the short arms of the X and Y chromosomes, on Ewing's sarcoma (ES) and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor (pPNET) cells. The gene product, a cell membrane protein, is recognized by the newly established monoclonal antibody (MoAb) HBA-71 and the previously described MoAb 12E7 and RFB-1. Furthermore, the reaction pattern of the MIC2 antibodies, especially HBA-71, with normal tissues and a great number of benign and malignant tumors (70 different tumors, 199 tumor samples), as well as the correlation between the specific chromosomal aberrations, i.e., the t(11;22) and the del(22) and the expression of this antigen, are demonstrated. Both ES and pPNET cells express the MIC2 gene in very high amounts, which represents a highly selective and almost unique feature of these cells, making an assignment of these tumors in one entity even more likely. The MIC2 antibodies are of great value for clinical and research purposes. 
1	Mammography and age: are we targeting the wrong women? A community survey of women and physicians. To determine mammography use among women with a broad range of ages, the authors surveyed women aged 30 to 74 years and physicians practicing primary care in two eastern North Carolina counties. Twenty-five percent of women in their 30s had ever had a mammogram, and 34% intended to have one in the coming year. From 45% to 52% of women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s had ever had a mammogram, and 55% to 57% intended to have one in the next year. Thirty-seven percent of women aged 70 to 74 years had ever had a mammogram, and 40% intended to have one in the following year. Nineteen percent of physicians reported screening nearly all women aged 30 to 39 years, and 14% screened few women aged 50 to 74 years. Younger women were more worried about breast cancer than older women and assessed their risk as higher, attitudes that were generally associated with higher mammography utilization. These community surveys suggest that mammography use may be excessive among younger women; older women continue to be underscreened. 
1	Subpleural mononuclear cell infiltration. Significance in the differential diagnosis of pleuritis showing nonspecific histologic findings. To determine if patients who had lymphocyte-rich pleural effusion and a pleural biopsy without any specific findings could be histopathologically differentiated between those with tuberculous and nontuberculous pleuritis, we histologically re-evaluated the pleural biopsies of all patients whose pleural effusion was predominant with lymphocytes and contained no malignant cells. A total of 40 patients with a nonspecific histologic findings of pleural biopsy specimen were categorized based on their ultimate diagnosis as having tuberculous (n = 15), carcinomatous (n = 10) or nontuberculous, benign pleuritis (n = 15). The pleural biopsy specimen of patients with nontuberculous, benign pleuritis frequently showed a band-like infiltration of mononuclear cells in the subpleural adipose tissue with minimal pleural inflammatory infiltrate (10 out of 15 patients), while the same finding was infrequent in those with tuberculous pleuritis (0 out of 15, p = 0.0001) and pleuritis associated with carcinoma (three out of 10, p = 0.082). Based on these results, the presence of band-like infiltration of mononuclear cells in the subpleural adipose tissue with minimal pleural inflammatory infiltrate in pleural biopsy specimens of patients with lymphocyte-rich pleural effusion suggests that the pleuritis is nontuberculous in its nature. 
5	Lung lobe torsion following lobectomy. Three cases of postoperative pulmonary lobe torsion were reported. Two of three showed hemorrhagic infarctions, and as a result underwent rethoracotomies and removal of the affected lobes. From these experiences, we consider that computed tomography (CT) and bronchofiberscopic examinations are useful for the diagnosis of advanced torsion. 
3	Lymphocytic hypophysitis with involvement of the cavernous sinus and hypothalamus. Two cases of lymphocytic hypophysitis are reported, in which hypothalamic involvement causing diabetes insipidus was a prominent clinical feature. In one case, a man had clinical and radiological evidence of the involvement of the cavernous sinus. This represents the second reported case of a man with lymphocytic hypophysitis. A transsphenoidal biopsy established the diagnosis in both cases. Neither the involvement of the cavernous sinus nor permanent diabetes insipidus has been reported previously. A review of the literature is provided.
