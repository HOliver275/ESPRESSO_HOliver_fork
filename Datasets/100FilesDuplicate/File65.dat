Experimental model of left ventricular failure. A model of chronic cardiac failure has undergone extensive hemodynamic investigation. Under anesthesia the homonymous and second diagonal coronary arteries of sheep have been ligated. The resulting myocardial infarction caused significant acute hemodynamic impairment (paired two-tailed t tests), mean pulmonary artery pressure increasing from 7.31 +/- 0.94 to 13.80 +/- 1.19 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), pulmonary artery diastolic pressure increasing from 4.94 +/- 1.03 to 11.13 +/- 1.27 mm Hg (p less than 0.001), and directly measured left ventricular end-diastolic pressure increasing from 9.31 +/- 1.52 to 17.42 +/- 1.82 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) after infarction documented with invasive monitoring. There was a hemodynamically significant left ventricular aneurysm (paired two-tailed t tests) in animals studied 3 months later, with increased mean pulmonary artery pressure from 7.20 +/- 1.15 to 13.80 +/- 2.00 mm Hg (p = 0.009), an increase in pulmonary artery diastolic pressure from 4.60 +/- 1.30 to 12.10 +/- 2.06 mm Hg (p = 0.006), and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 11.00 +/- 1.94 mm Hg before infarction to 17.00 +/- 2.69 mm Hg (p = 0.038). We conclude that this is a useful model of chronic left ventricular failure that is reproducible and applicable to investigations of therapeutic options in chronic heart failure. 
The clinical and endocrine outcome to trans-sphenoidal microsurgery of nonsecreting pituitary adenomas. From 1962 to 1987, 126 patients underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery for primary treatment of pituitary adenomas unassociated with clinical or biochemical evidence of hormonal overproduction. There were 73 male and 53 female patients (mean age, 50 +/- 12 years). Before surgery, 56% of the patients (70 of 124) had headaches, 74% (94 of 126) had deterioration of vision, and 12% (15 of 126) had ophthalmoplegia. Endocrine evaluation revealed the presence of hypogonadism in 75% (87 of 115), adrenal insufficiency in 36% (46 of 126), and hypothyroidism in 18% (21 of 122). Plasma prolactin was increased in 65% (56 of 86) with a mean level of 39 +/- 14 micrograms/l (normal, 3 to 20 micrograms/l). Radiologic enlargement of the sella turcica was documented in all cases: 67% (84 of 126) had enclosed and 33% (42 of 126) had invasive adenomas. After surgery, vision was normalized or improved in 75% (71 of 94) of the patients. Thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal functions were improved in 14% (three of 22), 41% (19 of 46), 11% (ten of 87), were unchanged in 82% (100 of 122), 77% (97 of 126), 89% (102 of 115), and worsened in 15% (19 of 22), 8% (ten of 126), 3% (102 of 115), respectively. Permanent diabetes insipidus occurred in 5% (seven of 126). Two patients died during the immediate postoperative period. The recurrence rate in patients with a mean follow-up of 6.4 +/- 4.2 years was 21% (15 of 71). These data indicate that trans-sphenoidal microsurgery is an effective and safe initial treatment for patients with nonsecreting pituitary adenoma and may reverse hypopituitarism. 
The current approach to the medical diagnosis of low back pain. A small number of patients who present with low back pain will have an underlying medical disorder as the source of their pain. Patients who fail to respond to conservative management with controlled physical activity and nonnarcotic analgesics should have a thorough re-evaluation to detect possible sources of nonmechanical pain. Symptoms of fever, weight loss, recumbency pain, morning stiffness, acute severe pain, or colicky back pain represent specific entry points into the algorithm for diagnosis of back pain from underlying systemic illnesses. These patients will generally require a plain roentgenographic examination with subsequent scintography, MRI, CT, laboratory work, and biopsy as indicated by any positive findings during the diagnostic work-up. Therapy for individuals with nonmechanical low back pain is directed at the specific medical disorder that is the cause of their symptoms. 
Melanocytic differentiation of human neuroblastoma: expression of a human melanosome-associated antigen. Five human neuroblastoma cell lines were examined for expression of a human melanosome-associated antigen (HMSA). Only cell line SK-N-SH reacted with a monoclonal antibody, HMSA-2, shown to recognize melanosomal glycoproteins. To further characterize the melanocytic lineages of SK-N-SH, three morphologically distinct clones designated SK-N-SH-N (neuroblast type), SK-N-SH-F (fibroblast type), and SK-N-SH-EP (epithelial type) were established by colony formation cloning. By fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis and tyrosinase assay, we found that only SK-N-SH-EP and SK-N-SH-F reacted with HMSA-2 and had tyrosinase activity. These results suggest that epithelial-type and fibroblast-type cells appear to possess the melanocytic potential, but not neuroblast-type cells. Furthermore, SK-N-SH-EP was found to spontaneously convert to neuroblast-type or fibroblast-type cells, whereas SK-N-SH-N and SK-N-SH-F clones have remained morphologically stable. Our results suggest that at least one neuroblastoma cell line, SK-N-SH, may be an excellent model for investigating clonal maturation and the melanocytic differentiation of neuroblastoma. 
Levels of morphine and metabolites in CSF during respiratory depression after intraventricular morphine injection. We report a case of respiratory depression after intracerebroventricular morphine administration of a dose inadvertently 10 times greater than the typical daily dose. At the time of the respiratory dysfunction, the concentrations of morphine and its metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were determined. On comparison of these results with previous clinical studies in which there was no respiratory depression, no relationship was found between the occurrence of respiratory depression and the concentration of morphine or its metabolites in the CSF. The occurrence and characteristics of respiratory depression may be related to the concentrations of morphine and its metabolites in bulbar tissue. 
Influence of progressive and of transient hypoxia on upper airway resistance in normal humans. In order to evaluate the influence of hypoxia on upper airway patency, we measured the response of upper airway resistance (UAR) to progressive (P) normocapnic hypoxia (Rebuck's method) and transient (T) hypoxia (three to five breaths to 100% N2) in 11 normal men. Breath-by-breath inspiratory UAR was calculated at isoflow during exclusive nasal breathing. The UAR response to hypoxia was characterized by the changes in nasal resistance and pharyngeal resistance (PR) as a function of SaO2, mean inspiratory flow (VT/Tl), and changes in the end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) measured with an inductance vest. The ventilatory response to hypoxia was greater during T (-0.31 +/- 0.03 L/min/%SaO2; mean +/- SEM) than during P (-0.27 +/- 0.03 L/min/%SaO2, p = 0.05). UAR decreased as SaO2 decreased; this decrease was steeper during T than during P hypoxia (delta PR/%SaO2: 3.9 +/- 0.5 during P and 2.5 +/- 0.2 during T, p = 0.05). For the whole group, there was no difference in the slope of the decrease in UAR with increasing VT/Tl between the two hypoxic tests (delta PR/delta VT/Tl: -0.85 +/- 0.1 during P and -0.70 +/- 0.1 during T, p greater than 0.05). However, in four subjects, the slope of the relationship PR/VT/Tl during T remained steeper than during P. EELV increased as SaO2 decreased, with a greater increase during progressive than during transient hypoxia. 
High frequency of the Gaucher disease mutation at nucleotide 1226 among Ashkenazi Jews. Reliable estimates of the frequency of Gaucher disease-producing mutations are not available. The high frequency of Gaucher disease in the Ashkenazi Jewish population is due to the occurrence of a mutation at nucleotide (nt) 1226. We have screened 593 DNA samples from normal Ashkenazi Jews, as well as 62 DNA samples from all our Ashkenazi Jewish patients with Gaucher disease, for the presence of the 1226 mutation. In the 593 presumed normal Ashkenazi Jewish individuals the 1226 mutation was identified in the heterozygous state in 37 and in the homozygous state in two, giving a gene frequency of .035 for the mutation. This 1226 mutation represented 73% of the 124 Gaucher disease alleles in Jewish Gaucher disease patients. Accordingly we estimate that the gene frequency for Gaucher disease among the Ashkenazi Jewish population is .047, which is equivalent to a carrier frequency of 8.9% and a birth incidence of 1:450. 
Aortic-carotid artery pressure differences and cephalic perfusion pressure during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in humans. OBJECTIVE: Animal studies have shown an aortic-carotid artery pressure difference during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), which compromises cerebral perfusion. This pressure difference is most marked with prolonged CPR and can be abolished with administration of high doses of epinephrine. To better understand the mechanism of cerebral blood flow during CPR in humans, we determined the aortic-carotid artery pressure difference, the cephalic perfusion pressure (the carotid artery-jugular vein pressure difference), and thoracic inlet venous "valving" (the central venous-jugular vein pressure difference), while administering standard doses of epinephrine. DESIGN: Prospective study with randomization as to which side the carotid artery was catheterized. SETTING: The resuscitation room of a large urban hospital's emergency department. PATIENTS: Fifteen adults in normothermic, nontraumatic prehospital cardiac arrest treated according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support guidelines, including administration of 1 mg epinephrine iv every 5 mins. INTERVENTIONS: The descending aorta, cervical common carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and central venous system were catheterized. Pressures were recorded during standard CPR for 5 mins after administration of 1 mg epinephrine iv. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Most patients received CPR for greater than 20 mins before the first epinephrine dose and for greater than 45 mins before pressure recording as described above. There was no significant difference between aortic and carotid artery compression and relaxation phase pressures. The mean +/- SD compression central venous-jugular vein pressure difference was 22.1 +/- 15.0 mm Hg, and the mean cephalic perfusion pressure was 20.8 +/- 19.5 mm Hg. CONCLUSIONS: There is no clinically important aortic-carotid artery pressure difference during human CPR using the standard dose of epinephrine, even with prolonged CPR. Despite carotid artery patency and thoracic inlet venous valving, the cephalic perfusion pressure is low during CPR in humans. 
Dutch general practice care for patients with epilepsy: results from the Dutch National Survey of Morbidity and Interventions. This study aimed to assess the share which Dutch general practice has in the care of patients with epilepsy. During a 3-month period 400,000 patient contacts in 103 general practices with a total list of 335,000 patients were registered, 1536 of these, concerning 1059 patients, concerned epilepsy. Contacts with patients with known epilepsy in Dutch General Practice were handled mainly by the practice nurse and most involved repeat prescriptions. Patients suspected of having epilepsy had more attention from the General Practitioner. The involvement of General Practitioners in the care of epilepsy was found to be small, but not unimportant. GPs are in a crucial position as regards the detection of epilepsy. They can enlarge their role in respect of patients with known epilepsy and improve continuity of care. 
Hemodynamic study during transdermal application of nitroglycerin tape in patients with cirrhosis. We studied 14 patients with portal hypertension and cirrhosis using portal and hepatic vein catheterizations to determine the effects of transdermal application of nitroglycerin tape (containing 10 mg of nitroglycerin and capable of releasing 6 to 7 mg of nitroglycerin in 12 hr) on splanchnic hemodynamics. Patients randomly received nitroglycerin (n = 7) or a placebo (n = 7). No significant changes were observed after the administration of the placebo. In contrast, transdermal nitroglycerin caused a significant reduction in portal pressure, as evaluated by measurements of the portal venous pressure gradient (-22%, p less than 0.01). The reduction of portal pressure was due to a decrease in the portal venous pressure, with no changes in the free hepatic venous pressure. Despite the fall in portal pressure, the hepatic blood flow was maintained. These findings suggest that transdermal nitroglycerin could be potentially useful in the treatment of portal hypertension associated with cirrhosis. 
Auer rod-like inclusions in circulating lymphoma cells. Circulating malignant lymphocytes from a 55-year-old woman with small cleaved follicular center cell lymphoma contained azurophilic splinter-shaped cytoplasmic inclusions. By light microscopic and ultrastructural criteria, these structures closely resembled Auer rods found in acute myeloid leukemia; however, the authors could not find cytochemical evidence of lysosomal origin (results were negative for myeloperoxidase, Sudan black B, acid phosphatase, and periodic acid-Schiff). Immunostaining and flow cytometric analysis confirmed a monoclonal IgM-kappa immunophenotype of the circulating malignant lymphoid cells. The inclusions did not show specific immunoglobulin staining by light microscopic or electron microscopic immunostaining techniques. The authors conclude that these membrane-bound inclusions probably represent aberrant lysosomes in the malignant cells. 
Cell cycle regulation of histone H1 kinase activity associated with the adenoviral protein E1A. Several cellular proteins form stable complexes with the proteins encoded by the adenovirus early region 1A (E1A) gene in extracts derived from adenovirus infected or transformed cells. Two of the cellular proteins that bind to E1A have been identified; one, a 105-kilodalton protein (pRb), is the product of the retinoblastoma gene, and the other, a 60-kilodalton protein, is a human cyclin A. Two other proteins that bind E1A have now been shown to be related to p34cdc2. This E1A complex displayed histone H1-specific kinase activity; the kinase activity was modulated during the cell division cycle, and association of pRb with E1A apparently was not required for this activity. 
Comparison of standard external CPR, open-chest CPR, and cardiopulmonary bypass in a canine myocardial infarct model. STUDY OBJECTIVES: After cardiac arrest, open-chest CPR (OCCPR) and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) have demonstrated higher resuscitation rates when compared individually with standard external CPR (SECPR). We compared all three techniques in a canine myocardial infarct ventricular fibrillation model. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six mongrel dogs were block-randomized to receive SECPR and advanced life support (nine), CPB (nine), or OCCPR (eight). DESIGN AND INTERVENTIONS: All dogs received left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion followed by four minutes of ventricular fibrillation without CPR and eight minutes of Thumper CPR. At 12 minutes, dogs received one of three resuscitation techniques. After resuscitation, all animals received four hours of intensive care. Animals that were resuscitated had histochemical determination of ischemic and necrotic myocardial areas. MEASUREMENTS: Intravascular pressures were measured and coronary perfusion pressure was calculated during baseline, cardiac arrest, resuscitation, and postresuscitation periods. Percent necrotic myocardium, percent ischemic myocardium, and necrotic-to-ischemic ratios were determined for resuscitated animals. Epinephrine dosage and number of countershocks were determined for each group. MAIN RESULTS: Nine of nine CPB and six of nine OCCPR, compared with two of eight SECPR animals, were resuscitated (P less than .01). Three of nine CPB and OCCPR and two of eight SECPR dogs survived to four hours (P = NS). Coronary perfusion pressure two minutes after institution of technique was significantly higher with CPB (75 +/- 37 mm Hg) and OCCPR (56 +/- 31 mm Hg) than in SECPR animals (16 +/- 16 mm Hg, P less than .04). Epinephrine required for resuscitation was significantly less with CPB (0.10 +/- 0.02 mg/kg) than for SECPR (0.28 +/- 0.11 mg/kg, P less than .002). The ratio of necrotic to ischemic myocardium at four hours was significantly lower with CPB (0.15 +/- 0.31) and OCCPR (0.39 +/- 0.25) than for SECPR (1.16 +/- 0.31, P less than .02). CONCLUSION: OCCPR and CPB produce higher coronary perfusion pressures and improved resuscitation rates from ventricular fibrillation when compared with SECPR in this canine myocardial infarct cardiac arrest model. CPB and OCCPR yielded similar resuscitation results, although less epinephrine was required with CPB. 
Ultrasound detection of fetal aneuploidy in patients with elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein. Increasing confidence in the ability of high-resolution ultrasound to detect neural tube and ventral wall defects has enabled us to offer a revised risk estimate to the patient with an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) level, such that amniocentesis may not be necessary. Recent authors have suggested that a reduced emphasis on follow-up amniocentesis fails to consider an increased risk for chromosomal anomalies in pregnancies with an elevated MSAFP, and that amniocentesis should still be performed. We reviewed our ultrasound findings from patients who underwent amniocentesis for evaluation of an elevated MSAFP and who had a karyotype prepared from the amniotic fluid sample. Four abnormal karyotypes were detected among 313 amniocenteses, and three of these were correctly predicted based on an abnormal ultrasound. The risk of an unexpected fetal aneuploidy after a normal consultative ultrasound in our series was one in 310. This is comparable to the risk of detecting abnormal chromosomes in the fetus of a 32-year-old woman, an age at which amniocentesis is not routinely offered. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma in Italian patients with cirrhosis BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are recognized as being at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. The magnitude of the risk, the natural history of this disease, and the possibilities for detecting potentially curable tumors in patients in the Western world are unknown. To address these questions, we examined 447 Italian patients with well-compensated cirrhosis (which was of viral origin in 62 percent of them) from 1985 through 1990, performing serum alpha-fetoprotein assays and real-time ultrasonography every 3 to 12 months. RESULTS. Hepatocellular carcinoma was found in 30 patients (7 percent) at base line and in another 29 patients (7 percent of 417 patients free of tumor at base line) during follow-up periods averaging 33 months (range, 1 to 48). The cumulative hazard of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up was higher among patients with persistently elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (12 with tumors among 42 with such levels) than among those with fluctuating levels (11 among 82) or those with consistently normal levels (6 among 255). Only 17 patients had potentially operable tumors. The proportion of potentially operable tumors among those detected during follow-up was significantly lower than the proportion at enrollment (4 of 29 vs. 13 of 30, P = 0.027). The survival at one year of the 12 patients who underwent surgery was 67 percent, and the tumor-recurrence rate was 60 percent. Outcome was not appreciably different for the five patients who refused surgery. CONCLUSIONS. In the West, as in Asia, patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at substantial risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, with a yearly incidence rate of 3 percent. Our screening program did not appreciably increase the rate of detection of potentially curable tumors. 
Isolated muscle hypertrophy as a sign of radicular or peripheral nerve injury. Two patients with isolated neurogenic hypertrophy of the trapezius muscle due to accessory nerve injury and a patient with neurogenic hypertrophy of the anterior tibial muscle due to chronic radicular lesion L4 are described. Electromyography of the affected muscles showed dense continuing spontaneous discharges of complex potentials. Muscle biopsy performed in two patients showed abundant hypertrophic muscle fibres, identified in one case by ATP-ase reaction as being of predominantly type I. In the majority of previously reported patients with neurogenic muscle hypertrophy confined to the calf muscle, a passive stretch mechanism was suggested as a cause of the hypertrophy. It is assumed that the excessive spontaneous muscle activity gave rise to the hypertrophy in these patients. This may also be true in previously reported patients with neurogenic hypertrophy and similar spontaneous activity in electromyography. 
Management of panfacial fractures. Panfacial injuries are those that involve trauma to the lower, middle, and upper facial bones. They often are accompanied by multisystem- or polytrauma and require a team approach for management. Although stabilization of the overall status of the patient takes precedence, early and total restoration of facial form and function should be the goal of the maxillofacial surgeon. 
Ralitoline: a reevaluation of anticonvulsant profile and determination of "active" plasma concentrations in comparison with prototype antiepileptic drugs in mice. Ralitoline (RLT) is a new thiazolidinone derivative with potent anticonvulsant activity in different seizure models. During Phase I studies, RLT was well tolerated in human volunteers and showed linear pharmacokinetics in the dose range tested (up to 150 mg). Since RLT will soon be entering clinical Phase II studies, we were interested in obtaining predictive data for effective plasma concentrations in patients. For this purpose, the anticonvulsant potency of RLT was determined in four seizure models in mice, and plasma levels were measured at time of peak drug effect. The four models were the threshold for maximal (tonic extension) electroshock seizures (MES), the threshold for clonic seizures determined by i.v. infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), the traditional MES test with supramaximal (50 mA) stimulation, and generalized clonic seizures induced by s.c. administration of PTZ. Furthermore, median minimal "neurotoxic" doses (TD50s) were determined by the rotorod and chimney test for calculation of protective indices. All data obtained for RLT were compared with data obtained with standard antiepileptic drugs: phenobarbital, phenytoin, valproate, and diazepam. The onset of anticonvulsant action after i.p. injection of RLT was very rapid, and the peak drug effect was already obtained after 2 min. In the MES models, RLT was the most potent compound. "Active" plasma levels ranged from approximately 300 ng/ml in the MES threshold test to approximately 1,300 ng/ml in the MES test. RLT was also capable of increasing the PTZ threshold, whereas, possibly because of its short duration of action in mice, it was not very active in the s.c. PTZ seizure test. 
The prognostic value of endotracheal tube-air leak following tracheal surgery in children. In an effort to determine if the endotracheal tube-leak pressure has prognostic value in relation to a successful outcome after one-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction or cricoid split surgery, a retrospective analysis was performed on 17 children who had undergone such surgery. The daily leak pressures, length of intubation, and ultimate outcome of attempts at extubation were noted. One hundred percent of patients with a leak pressure of less than 20 cm H2O on the day before extubation were successfully extubated. In contrast, the failure rate was 100% in children extubated with a leak of greater than 30 mm H2O. The difference between these two groups was statistically significant (chi 2, 13.03). Sixty percent of patients with leak pressures in the range of 21 to 30 cm H2O were successfully extubated. The endotracheal tube-leak pressure is a parameter that has prognostic value, and should be considered in determining when to extubate children who have undergone tracheal reconstructive surgery. 
Interaction of baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflex control of sympathetic nerve activity in normal humans. Animal studies have demonstrated that activation of the baroreflex by increases in arterial pressure inhibits cardiovascular and ventilatory responses to activation of peripheral chemoreceptors (PC) with hypoxia. In this study, we examined the influences of baroreflex activation on the sympathetic response to stimulation of PC and central chemoreceptors in humans. PC were stimulated by hypoxia (10% O2/90% N2) (n = 6) and central chemoreceptors by hypercapnia (7% CO2/93% O2) (n = 6). Responses to a cold pressor stimulus were also obtained as an internal reflex control to determine the selectivity of the interactive influence of baroreflex activation. Baroreflex activation was achieved by raising mean blood pressure by greater than 10 mmHg with intravenous infusion of phenylephrine (PE). Sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) to muscle was recorded from a peroneal nerve (microneurography). During hypoxia alone, SNA increased from 255 +/- 92 to 354 +/- 107 U/min (P less than 0.05). During PE alone, mean blood pressure increased and SNA decreased to 87 +/- 45 U/min (P less than 0.05). With hypoxia during baroreflex activation with PE, SNA did not increase (50 +/- 23 U/min). During hypercapnia alone, SNA increased from 116 +/- 39 to 234 +/- 72 U/min (P less than 0.01). Hypercapnia during baroreflex activation with PE increased SNA from 32 +/- 25 U/min during PE alone to 61 +/- 26 U/min during hypercapnia and PE (P less than 0.05). Like hypercapnia (but unlike hypoxia) the cold pressor test also increased SNA during PE. We conclude that baroreflex activation selectively abolishes the SNA response to hypoxia but not to hypercapnia or the cold pressor test. The inhibitory interaction of the baroreflex and the peripheral chemoreflex may be explained by convergence of baroreceptor and peripheral chemoreceptor afferents on neurons in the medulla. 
Osteochondrodysplasia in Fryns syndrome. Various skeletal abnormalities have been identified in roentgenograms of persons with Fryns syndrome, but to our knowledge, no histopathologic description of bone or cartilage has been published. We describe disordered endochondral and intramembranous bone formation in a premature female infant with Fryns syndrome. This infant and a full sibling (ie, had same set of parents) with Fryns syndrome in addition exhibited delayed ossification of the basiocciput and of cervical vertebral bodies, also previously undescribed in Fryns syndrome. These findings expand the spectrum of Fryns syndrome to include osteochondrodysplasia. 
Pylorus and antroseromuscular flap-preserving gastrectomy--a new type of reconstruction after subtotal gastrectomy for treatment of gastroduodenal ulcer: clinical and experimental study. To avoid motility disturbances after Billroth gastrectomy, the authors designed pylorus and antroseromuscular flap-preserving subtotal gastrectomy (PAFPG). Results showed that gastric motility and emptying time of dogs after PAFPG were close to normal. PAFPG was applied to 125 consecutive patients with gastroduodenal ulcers (gastric ulcer, 15 patients; duodenal ulcer, 94 patients; and combined ulcers, 16 patients) confirmed by barium examination and fibro-gastroendoscopy. All patients recovered smoothly, none of them had postoperative complication. Gastric acid output reduction rates were as follows: basal acid output, 85.05% +/- 8.13%; maximal acid output, 81.76% +/- 10.85%; peak acid output, 81.42% +/- 10.15%. The incidence of postoperative enterogastric reflux (endoscopically) and the concentration of cholic acids in gastric juice were significantly lower in patients after PAFPG than after Billroth I or II gastrectomy. Results suggest that PAFPG reduced gastric acid outputs definitely and overcame adverse motility consequences after Billroth I or II gastrectomy desirably. 
Astrocytoma and associated arteriovenous malformation. A case is reported of a cerebral arteriovenous malformation occurring in continuity with an astrocytoma. Possible etiologies of this unusual association are discussed. 
Clinical management of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy. Rapid delivery of thrombolytic therapy to suitable patients with acute myocardial infarction can limit myocardial damage and reduce the risk of death. This requires an emergency department team approach following a written protocol to initiate thrombolytic therapy within 45 minutes of the patient's arrival at the emergency department. Nurses and physicians caring for patients with acute myocardial infarction must be aware of inclusion and exclusion criteria, drug preparation, dosage and administration, recommended adjunctive therapies, and potential complications associated with pharmacologic thrombolysis. All patients with acute myocardial infarction should be carefully screened for their potential for receiving thrombolytic therapy with a favorable benefit/risk ratio. 
Management of patients with facial trauma and associated ocular/orbital injuries. Ocular injury can be associated with facial fractures in a significant percentage of cases. It is mandatory for surgeons treating such fractures to be familiar with the types of orbital injuries, the appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests, and the management techniques involved in treating traumatic visual loss. This article reviews the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to this important problem. 
Sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias following coronary artery bypass surgery comparing mammary versus saphenous vein grafts. This retrospective study was designed to determine the incidence of sustained supraventricular tachyarrhythmias (SVTs) in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) with internal mammary artery (IMA) grafts, Group A, compared with those with saphenous vein grafts (SVG), Group B. Among 569 consecutive patients who underwent CABG surgery in the same institution, a total of 80 cases from Group A and 80 cases from Group B were selected for this study after application of exclusion criteria. Excluded from this study were the following: patients with preexisting or prior history of SVTs, significant left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction less than 40%), postoperative myocardial infarction, drug toxicity or electrolyte imbalance, and advanced chronic obstructive lung disease. Group A consisted of 63 men and 17 women and Group B consisted of 52 men and 28 women. All patients were monitored either in ICU or by telemetry for a period of three to six days after surgery and all had a predischarge 12-lead electrocardiogram. Both groups were fairly comparable in most of their clinical profile and number of grafts. The incidence of SVTs in Group A was 31% (25 of 80 patients) and in Group B was 24% (19 of 80 patients). Furthermore, the incidence of postoperative pericarditis was noted in 35% (28 of 80 patients) of Group A and in 19% (15 of 80 patients) in Group B. The authors conclude that male tobacco smokers of Group A tended to have a significantly higher incidence of postoperative pericarditis with a higher trend for postoperative SVTs than patients from Group B. 
Stress and alcohol interaction: an update of human research. The literature on alcohol and stress in human subjects carried out since 1981 is reviewed. The review covers selected aspects of the interaction of alcohol and stress. (1) Most of the review focuses on the role of stress on alcohol ingestion. Retrospective research based on data from the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey indicated an increase in alcohol consumption with anxiety in certain groups of, as yet not well characterized, individuals. For example, although still insufficiently documented, stress does not appear to play a significant role in alcohol ingestion by women and the elderly. By contrast, stress does appear to play a role in the control of alcohol ingestion by adolescents. Prospective studies employing questionnaire-interview formats generally support an effect of stress on alcohol ingestion. However, studies employing male college aged social drinkers did not find a correlation between levels of stress and ingestion of alcohol. Alcoholics also differ in the reasons for drinking alcohol, but generally ingest alcohol to lessen anxiety/stress. It is clear that the Tension Reduction Hypothesis as originally postulated is no longer adequate. Many new models based on an interaction of alcohol and stress have been proposed to explain the control of alcohol consumption. Considering the multidimensionality of factors that appear to contribute to the control of alcohol ingestion, it is unlikely that a single model could possibly be relevant to alcohol ingestion under all conditions. More likely different models may be relevant to alcohol consumption under specific conditions, or for specific populations. (2) Alcohol has been reported to decrease anxiety in agoraphobics. The self-medication by agoraphobics may contribute significantly to their alcohol abuse. (3) Alcohol has also been reported to decrease tremor of the hands in stressed subjects as well as in patients with essential tremor. (4) Although a number of studies have employed electrodermal activity in studies aimed at the interaction of alcohol and stress, the results have been rather inconsistent. (5) The controversy on the purported beneficial effect of alcohol on the cardiovascular system persists. A number of studies have shown a J- or U-shaped relationship between alcohol ingestion and incidence of coronary heart disease. Alcohol may also influence stress-induced changes in blood pressure. Although a number of studies have demonstrated lower blood pressure in individuals ingesting less than two drinks per day compared with abstainers or heavy alcohol imbibers, the evidence is not conclusive. (6) It is not clear whether the interaction of alcohol and stress involves alterations in plasma catecholamines. 
The role of plasminogen activator in adhesion prevention. The reduction in peritoneal plasminogen activator activity (believed to be the pathogenic mechanism of adhesion formation) and its replacement with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) have been investigated in the prevention of initial (primary) and recurrent adhesion production. Other, potentially harmful, effects of intra-abdominal rt-PA application have also been examined. This included effects on wound and colonic healing and hemostasis. The prevention of adhesion formation was studied in primary and recurrent adhesion formation using a rabbit model. Primary adhesions formed in one of 14 occasions (7 per cent) with rt-PA compared with 12 of 15 occasions (80 per cent) with placebo (chi-square equals 15.542, p less than 0.001). Recurrent adhesions formed on two of 27 occasions (7 per cent) with rt-PA compared with 22 of 28 occasions with placebo (79 per cent) and 12 of 12 occasions with control rabbits (100 per cent, chi-square equals 40.588, p less than 0.0001). The application of rt-PA to abdominal wounds in the rabbit failed to show any reduction in wound strength at four, seven and ten days. Colonic anastomotic healing was unaltered by rt-PA at three, five and seven days. There was no difference seen in hemorrhagic events between control, placebo or rt-PA rabbits at any stage. The use of rt-PA is an exciting development in the field of adhesion prevention; it is an effective inhibitor of adhesion formation and intra-abdominal administration appears safe in a rabbit model. 
Synchronous primary mucosal melanoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. We present a case of contiguous primary malignant melanoma of the nose and maxillary antrum and mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the maxillary antrum. We believe that this association has not been previously recorded; whether this represents divergent differentiation in a single tumour or 'collision' of two separate tumours is uncertain. 
Variation in intravaginal pressure measurements. The wide variation in intravaginal pressure measurements of the circumvaginal muscles (CVM) was studied in five subjects under well-controlled conditions. Previous research and clinical observations have indicated that fluctuations in the measurement of intravaginal pressure may be associated with time of day, day of testing, and existing stress factors. Subjects were assessed four times per day, on four consecutive days, for a total of 16 assessments. At each of the 16 conditions for a given subject, 10 CVM contractions lasting 12 seconds each were recorded and the variables, maximum pressure (MP10), peak maximum pressure (PMP), and abdominal pressure were analyzed. The within-subject variance was 15.5 (SD = 3.9); the between-subject variance was 132.4 (SD = 11.5). The effects of day, time, and stressor were analyzed by ANOVA specifically designed for variance estimates; no significant differences were found. The clinical observations that led to the study were not supported when systematically investigated. However, consistent data collection procedures appeared to reduce within-subject variance. 
Extracranial vertebral artery dissection following tonic clonic seizure. A 34 year old woman developed cerebral infarction, following a tonic-clonic seizure. A vertebral artery dissection was demonstrated and may have been caused by arterial trauma during the seizure. This cause of morbidity following convulsive seizures may have been overlooked in the past and needs to be recognised in view of the potential benefits of anticoagulation. 
A prospective study of parental history of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease in men. The relation between parental history of myocardial infarction (MI) and risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) was prospectively examined among 45,317 U.S. male health professionals who were free of diagnosed CAD, 40 to 75 years of age in 1986 and followed for 2 years. These men provided details of parental history of MI, including their parents' age at the first event, their personal history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus, and a detailed dietary assessment completed at baseline. During 72,454 person-years of follow-up, 181 non-fatal MIs were documented, 49 men died from MI or sudden death, and 140 underwent coronary artery surgery or angioplasty. Compared with men without any history of parental MI, those whose mothers or fathers had had an MI at less than 70 years of age had a substantially elevated risk of MI (relative risk = 2.2, 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.8 for maternal history; relative risk = 1.7, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.3 for paternal history). Risk of MI increased with decreasing age at parental MI. Paternal but not maternal history of MI was related to increased risk of coronary artery surgery. These associations were not appreciably altered by controlling for diet or established risk factors, either individually or in multivariate models. These prospective data indicate that a history of MI in either parent is associated with an increased risk of CAD among men. 
Comparison of the effects of torasemide and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites: a randomized, double-blind study. In a randomized double-blind trial we compared the effects of torasemide, a new loop diuretic, and furosemide in nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites during a 3-day period in association with potassium canrenoate (200 mg/day) administration. Doses of loop diuretics administered in this trial (10 and 25 mg/day of torasemide and furosemide, respectively) had been shown to be equipotent in healthy subjects. Torasemide induced significantly greater natriuresis than furosemide (p less than 0.02), with a twofold greater percentage increase in basal values (day 1: 130% vs. 50%; day 2: 104% vs. 42%; and day 3: 65% vs. 26%, respectively). Body weight loss was significantly higher during torasemide (p less than 0.02) administration, and the overall decrease at the end of the treatment was twice as high for furosemide (2.5 +/- 0.6 kg vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4 kg, respectively). Diuresis was also higher during torasemide administration, but the difference was not significant (p = 0.08). The extent of kaliuresis observed during the two treatments was almost identical despite the striking differences in the natriuretic response. The effects of the two treatments on plasma electrolytes, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, mean arterial pressure, heart rate and plasma arginine vasopressin concentration were similar. Both drugs caused increases in plasma renin activity at the end of the treatment, whereas plasma aldosterone concentration slightly increased only after torasemide administration. Despite the presence of a trend toward a more pronounced effect on these parameters after torasemide administration, no significant difference between the two treatments was observed. 
Neurophysiological observations on the effects of botulinum toxin treatment in patients with dystonic blepharospasm. Botulinum toxin treatment improves dystonic blepharospasm by inducing transient paresis of the orbicularis oculi muscle. It is not known if it also reduces the enhanced brainstem neuronal excitability found in this disorder. We have performed conventional electromyography (EMG) and blink reflex excitability studies on fifteen patients with blepharospasm before and after botulinum toxin treatment. Denervation signs were found with needle EMG in all treated muscles. Amplitude of the facial compound muscle action potential (CMAP) and R1 response was reduced after botulinum toxin injections. In blink reflex excitability studies, the recovery of R2 response was enhanced after treatment even when patients were tested at the time of maximal benefit from botulinum toxin injections. The results suggest that there is little influence of botulinum toxin treatment upon the enhanced excitability of brainstem interneurons in patients with blepharospasm. 
Clinical stage I nonseminomatous germ cell tumors of testis. Observation vs retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Between 1980 and 1989, 186 patients with testicular tumors were seen at Roswell Park Memorial Institute. Of these, 66.6 percent (124/186) were diagnosed to have nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGT) and 22 percent (41/186) were clinically determined to have Stage I disease. Patients with clinical Stage I NSGT either underwent observation or retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). Recurrence in the observation group of patients was 23.5 percent (4/17) between four and eighteen months (mean 10 months) with the retroperitoneum being the most common site. All but 1 patient (80%) were salvaged with platinum-based combination chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients who had RPLND, 21 percent (5/24) had a false-negative metastatic evaluation. All the patients who had surgically documented metastatic disease were successfully treated with chemotherapy. The similar recurrence rates in the observation group and the false-negative RPLND group suggest that the failure rate in the observation group is a result of the inability to stage accurately patients with NSGT. RPLND continues to be the standard therapy in patients with clinical Stage I disease. Despite its high recurrence rate, observation should, however, be offered to well-motivated and selected patients since salvage platinum-based combination chemotherapy is very effective and the majority of patients in this group are spared a major operative procedure. 
Cure of early-stage Hodgkin's disease with subtotal nodal irradiation. Ninety-four consecutive patients with Stage I or II Hodgkin's disease who presented supradiaphragmatically were treated with radiation therapy alone at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology from January 1978 through December 1986. Fifty-two patients (55%) were staged pathologically, and 42 (45%) were staged clinically. The latter included lymphangiography and/or abdominal computed tomographic scan. Most patients with B symptoms and/or bulky disease were excluded from this series. Seventy-four patients were treated with subtotal nodal irradiation (mantle and periaortic fields). The spleen was treated if the patient had not undergone splenectomy. Twenty patients received mantle irradiation only. No patient received total nodal irradiation. All patients had an initial complete response. With a minimum follow-up of 7 months (median, 7.7 years; seven patients died before 3 years of follow-up, but all other patients had at least 3 years of follow-up), 81 patients (86%) remained disease-free. Six of 52 (12%) of the pathologically staged group had a relapse, as did seven of 42 (17%) of the clinically staged group (P = 0.68). Eight of 57 Stage I patients versus five of 37 Stage II patients had a relapse (P greater than 0.99). Analysis of disease-free survival by age, histologic findings, sex, and sites of involvement did not predict relapse. The pelvis was the most common site of failure (nine patients, 10%). However, only three patients (3%) failed in the pelvis alone. These results indicate that patients who, after adequate clinical staging with selective use of staging laparotomy, are found to have Stage I and II Hodgkin's disease may be treated with subtotal nodal irradiation with a high rate of cure. 
Concurrent nitroglycerin administration decreases thrombolytic potential of tissue-type plasminogen activator. Dynamic coronary vasoconstriction may play a role in coronary artery reocclusion after successful thrombolysis. The effect of nitroglycerin on the thrombolytic effects of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was examined in dogs with an electrically induced occlusive coronary artery thrombus. Eleven dogs were randomly given rt-PA alone and seven rt-PA with nitroglycerin. The dose of rt-PA was 0.75 mg/kg body weight given over 20 min and the dose of nitroglycerin was 125 micrograms/min for 40 min. The reperfusion rate in the dogs given rt-PA alone was 73% (8 of 11 dogs) and that in the rt-PA plus nitroglycerin group was 57% (four of seven dogs) (p = NS). The time to thrombolysis (or reperfusion) in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was 70% greater than in those receiving rt-PA alone (means +/- SD/29.8 +/- 9.9 versus 17.6 +/- 5.9 min, p less than 0.02), and the duration of reperfusion much shorter (11 +/- 17 versus 42 +/- 16 min, p less than 0.02). Peak coronary blood flow after reperfusion in dogs receiving rt-PA plus nitroglycerin was also less than in those receiving rt-PA alone (36 +/- 52 versus 63 +/- 20 ml/min, p less than 0.02). Reocclusion occurred in all dogs given rt-PA with nitroglycerin and in six of eight given rt-PA alone (p = NS). Plasma concentrations of rt-PA were lower when nitroglycerin was given with rt-PA alone (427 +/- 279 versus 1,471 +/- 600 ng/ml, p less than 0.01). 
Destructive lesions in demyelinating disease. Three cases are presented in which clinical and radiological features suggested the diagnosis of glioma but surgical biopsy revealed a demyelinating process, with tissue destruction and cyst formation in two. One patient had clinically definite multiple sclerosis. Two had probable acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Treatment with high dose steroids is appropriate when there is clinical or investigative evidence to suggest the presence of demyelinating disease, before deciding on biopsy. 
Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet in China, Finland, and the United States. Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet were compared in Tianjin province, People's Republic of China; in North Karelia Province, Finland; and in the United States as a whole. People in Tianjin received 7 percent of their energy intake from saturated fats, whereas people in the United States received 13 percent and those in North Karelia received 20. The mean blood cholesterol levels for men were 158 milligrams per deciliter (mg per dl) for Tianjin, 216 mg per dl for the United States, and 241 mg per dl for North Karelia. The smoking prevalence among men was highest in Tianjin (66 percent), followed by the United States (42 percent) and Finland (36 percent). The differences among mortality rates for the three locales were less pronounced among women than among men. Age-standardized total mortality for women was highest for Tianjin and lowest in North Karelia. The reverse was true for men. Age-standardized total mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin and highest in North Karelia. Age-standardized ischemic heart disease mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin (99 per 100,000) and highest in North Karelia (730 per 100,000). For women, the corresponding figures were 83 per 100,000 in Tianjin and 164 per 100,000 in North Karelia. Although salt intake was higher in Tianjin than in North Karelia, the blood pressure was on average lower in persons from Tianjin than in those from North Karelia. The stroke mortality rate in Tianjin, however, was much higher than in either Finland or the United States. 
Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring: prognostic aspects during acoustic tumor removal. Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring with electrical stimulation (IFNMES) has become an integral part of acoustic tumor surgery. We reviewed the records of fifty-six patients who underwent translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removal with IFNMES. There was excellent correlation between intraoperative facial nerve activity and immediate postoperative facial nerve function (24 hours after surgery and at hospital discharge). Our data would suggest that patients who exhibit less than 500 microvolts of ongoing EMG activity during surgery, and who yield at least a 500-microvolt contraction when stimulated with 0.05 milliamps at the brainstem after tumor removal, can expect an excellent immediate facial nerve result (grade I or II). 
An animal model for colon cancer metastatic cell line with enhanced metastasizing ability. Establishment and characterization. We have developed an animal model for colon cancer metastasis and produced a metastasizing tumor after using a microinjection technique to inject SW480 cells into the cecal wall of athymic nude mice during "minilaparotomy." After the metastatic foci formed in murine lung, an in vitro primary culture was performed and a new metastatic cancer cell line, which was designated as CC-ML3, was established. The studies included: 1) the comparison between SW 480 and CC-ML3 in morphology, growth kinetics, seeding and plating efficiency, and karyotype; and 2) carcino-embryonic antigen determination, origination, and metastatic ability of CC-ML3. The results showed that CC-ML3 was significantly different from SW480 in vitro and possessed a high metastatic potential in vivo. This newly developed animal model may thus be useful for studying the biology and pathogenesis of metastasis of human colonic cancer. 
Differential effects of atrial natriuretic peptide and dopamine on urinary protein excretion in chronic glomerulonephritis. 1. To examine whether or not atrial natriuretic peptide-induced proteinuria simply results from increases in urine flow or glomerular filtration rate, we infused dopamine (1 microgram min-1 kg-1) and alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (0.025 microgram min-1 kg-1) into nine patients with chronic glomerulonephritis and nine essential hypertensive patients without renal damage, and compared the effects of the two agents on renal function and urinary protein excretion. 2. In patients with chronic glomerulonephritis, dopamine infusion significantly increased urinary sodium excretion (+59%), renal blood flow (+20%) and creatinine clearance (+14%). However, urinary protein excretion was not changed. Addition of atrial natriuretic peptide to the dopamine infusion further increased urinary sodium excretion and maintained creatinine clearance at the same level. In contrast to the infusion of dopamine alone, atrial natriuretic peptide markedly increased urinary protein excretion (77 versus 229 mg min-1 m2, P less than 0.02). Furthermore, the addition of atrial natriuretic peptide elevated the urinary protein/creatinine ratio (1.55 versus 5.35, P less than 0.05), while dopamine alone did not (1.55 versus 1.45, not significant). 3. In essential hypertensive patients, dopamine and dopamine plus ANP showed renal effects similar to those of chronic glomerulonephritis; however, the urinary excretion of protein was not changed significantly. 4. These results suggest that atrial natriuretic peptide may increase urinary protein excretion mainly by increasing the permeability of the damaged glomeruli to protein rather than by simply increasing urine flow or glomerular filtration. Possible mechanisms underlying the proteinuria-increasing effects of atrial natriuretic peptide are discussed. 
Transabdominal and transvaginal sonography of ovarian masses. This chapter outlined the sonographic appearances of most ovarian tumors using both transabdominal and transvaginal sonography. The use of transabdominal and transvaginal sonography for the early detection of ovarian carcinoma seems promising and should be pursued in several institutions as clinical trials. 
Long-term health risks and benefits of oral contraceptive use. The contraceptive effect of oral contraceptive use provides an important health benefit, particularly in developing countries, where the risks of pregnancy and childbearing are increased. Several important noncontraceptive health benefits of oral contraceptive use include the prevention of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Data are generally reassuring concerning the risks of oral contraceptive use, which include cardiovascular disease and breast and cervical cancer. 
Malignant potential of the cryptorchid testis. A follow-up study of 224 male patients from Rochester, Minnesota, diagnosed with cryptorchidism during the period from 1935 through 1974 was conducted to assess the frequency of subsequent testicular neoplasms. Age-specific rates for testicular neoplasm in this community were used to estimate an expected number for comparison with that observed. Two malignant testicular neoplasms have occurred in this cohort; thus, the standardized morbidity ratio was 11.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4 to 41.1). Of the 158 patients born in the community, 11% were known to have birth weights of less than 2,500 g, approximately twice the expected occurrence. Increased risks were also noted for inguinal hernia, hypospadias, Down's syndrome, cleft lip or palate (or both), clubfoot, and congenital heart disease, for which the standardized morbidity ratios were 3.6, 4.7, 17.8, 11.3, 11.7, and 2.7, respectively. The increased risk for malignant neoplasms observed in this cohort of patients with cryptorchidism is consistent with that found in earlier studies. 
Endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis Endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain has been the preferred treatment for palmar or axillary hyperhidrosis in this unit since 1980. A retrospective study was carried out of the first 112 patients with case material derived from a postal questionnaire, chart review and outpatient assessment. Eighty-five patients undergoing bilateral transthoracic electrocautery who replied to the questionnaire (76 per cent response rate) form the basis of this study. There were 65 females and 20 males with a mean age of 24.3 years (range 15-40 years). The hands alone were affected in 20 patients (24 per cent), the axillae alone in 17 (20 per cent) and both areas in 48 (56 per cent). Mean hospital stay was 3.1 days (range 1-7 days). Outcome was assessed by 92 per cent of patients immediately after operation as 'very much improved' or 'moderately improved', and this assessment persisted in 85 per cent after a mean follow-up of 43 months (range 3-95 months). Cosmetic results were rated as satisfactory by 95 per cent. Apart from pain after operation, morbidity was limited to transient Horner's syndrome in three patients, surgical emphysema in three, and pneumothorax requiring a chest drain in one. A repeat procedure was needed in one patient because of an inadequate first operation. Some compensatory hyperhidrosis occurred in 54 (64 per cent) patients. As a minimally invasive procedure, endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery should be considered the treatment of choice for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis. 
Rare presentation of a parapharyngeal schwannoma. Schwannoma, or neurilemmoma, is included in the differential diagnosis of masses in the parapharyngeal space. Schwannomata do not usually cause acute inflammation, and therefore do not tend to present as emergencies as in this case, in which there was acute respiratory embarrassment. 
Primary malignant melanoma of male urethra. A case of primary malignant melanoma of the male urethra is reported. Treatment included partial urethrectomy, bilateral inguinal and iliac lymphadenectomy, and post-surgical systemic chemotherapy. After thirty-six months, the patient is alive with cutaneous, pelvic lymph node, and gastric metastases. 
Parental sex effect in familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Since a parental sex effect has been reported in Huntington's disease, we looked to see whether a similar effect is apparent in adult (autosomal dominant) familial ALS. We analyzed the data for 145 patients, with an onset age range of 20 to 68 years and a known affected parent (AP), from 52 families described in the literature. There was a significant increase in the percentage of patients inheriting the gene from an affected mother as a function of the age at onset. There was also a significant correlation between AP and offspring age at onset only when the AP was the mother. 
Carotid endarterectomy in elderly patients Between 1971 and 1989, 749 carotid endarterectomies were performed at our institution for symptomatic carotid occlusive disease in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these procedures, 693 were done in patients 71 through 80 years of age, and 56 were done in patients between the ages of 81 and 90 years. The neurologic morbidity and perioperative mortality in the former group were 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, whereas in the latter group the corresponding values were 5.4% and 0%, respectively. For the entire group, the neurologic morbidity was 3.1% and the mortality was 1.3%. Of the 23 new postoperative neurologic deficits, 19 (83%) occurred in high-risk patients with severe preoperative neurologic or medical risks, and 14 (61%) of these deficits were minor. In selected elderly patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusive disease, endarterectomy seems to be a safe procedure that is associated with acceptably low perioperative morbidity and mortality. 
Resting energy expenditure in patients with newly detected gastric and colorectal cancers. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured in 104 patients with newly detected gastric or colorectal (GCR) cancer and was compared with two groups of control subjects without cancer: healthy subjects (H control subjects) and patients with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GI patients). REE in GCR-cancer patients was not significantly different from REE in GI patients or H control subjects. Comparison of measured REE with predicted REE obtained from prediction equations may erroneously suggest that increased REE is a contributing factor in the development of cancer cachexia. No significant differences in REE were found when patients with liver metastases were compared with patients without metastases. There were no differences in REE between gastric and colorectal cancer patients. The decrease in energy expenditure, which normally occurs during starvation and weight loss in healthy men and women, could not be demonstrated in weight-losing, GCR-cancer patients. In conclusion, elevation of REE contributes little to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia in GCR-cancer patients. 
Events in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST): mortality in the entire population enrolled [published erratum appears in J Am Coll Cardiol 1991 Sep;18(3):888] To test the hypothesis that suppression of ventricular arrhythmias by antiarrhythmic drugs after myocardial infarction improves survival, the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) was initiated. Suppression was evaluated before randomization during an open label titration period. Patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed were randomized in the main study and those whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed were randomized in a substudy. Overall survival and survival free of arrhythmic death or cardiac arrest were lower [corrected] in patients treated with encainide or flecainide than in patients treated with placebo. However, the death rate in patients randomized to placebo therapy was lower than expected. This report describes the survival experience of all patients enrolled in CAST and compares it with mortality in other studies of patients with ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. As of April 18, 1989, 2,371 patients had enrolled in CAST and entered prerandomization, open label titration: 1,913 (81%) were randomized to double-blind, placebo-controlled therapy (1,775 patients whose arrhythmias were suppressed and 138 patients whose arrhythmias were partially suppressed during open label titration); and 458 patients (19%) were not randomized because they were still in titration, had died during titration or had withdrawn. Including all patients who enrolled in CAST, the actuarial (Kaplan-Meier) estimate of 1-year mortality was 10.3%. To estimate the "natural" mortality rate of patients enrolled in CAST, an analysis was done that adjusted for deaths that might be attributable to encainide or flecainide treatment either during prerandomization, open label drug titration or after randomization. Because the censoring procedure excluded patients treated with encainide or flecainide after randomization, the mortality estimate will be less than the unadjusted mortality estimate of 10.3%. 
Acute lung injury following reperfusion after ischemia in the hind limbs of rats. In this study, we proposed that oxygen free radicals participate in the acute pulmonary injury that follows limb ischemia/reperfusion. Using an established model of hind limb ischemia, reproducible lung injury occurred after reperfusion. Lung microvascular permeability was measured with 125I-BSA and increased two-fold after 30 minutes of reperfusion. Pulmonary injury was blocked with DMSO, DMTU, allopurinol, indomethacin, and SOD plus catalase. The degree of pulmonary neutrophil sequestration as assessed by tissue myeloperoxidase activity was significantly diminished in animals pretreated with antioxidants. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not attenuate the neutrophil sequestration within the pulmonary parenchyma. These data suggest that increased lung microvascular permeability and neutrophil accumulation occur following hind limb ischemia/reperfusion. Therapeutic interventions with oxygen radical inhibitors blocked this process, while the prostaglandin inhibitor, indomethacin, only reduced lung permeability. 
Antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens: serologic marker for Sweet's syndrome. Seven patients with a clinical and histologic diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome were tested for the presence of circulating antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Six of the seven patients had detectable antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies at a serum dilution of at least 1:20. Antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were not found in serum from patients with a range of cutaneous diseases, some known to cause clinical or histologic confusion with Sweet's syndrome. The detection of circulating antibodies to the neutrophil cytoplasm may be of possible diagnostic value in Sweet's syndrome. 
Effects of postural changes versus exercise on the electrophysiologic parameters of the accessory pathway. The electrophysiologic profile of the accessory pathway was studied in 17 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation 32 +/- 14 years) with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome who were either lying down in a supine position, standing, or undergoing isometric or dynamic treadmill exercise. There were significant decreases in the PP interval after isometric exercise, standing and dynamic exercise (supine 764 +/- 224, standing 638 +/- 146, isometric 605 +/- 170, treadmill 455 +/- 86 ms; p less than 0.05). Both anterograde and retrograde accessory pathway refractory periods were measured after a constant drive of 400 ms during lying down supine, standing and isometric and treadmill exercise (Bruce protocol stage II). There was no significant decrease in the anterograde accessory pathway refractory period during isometric exercise (lying down 265 +/- 22 to isometric exercise 256 +/- 13 ms, p less than 0.05), but there were significant decreases (p less than 0.05) during standing (246 +/- 24 ms) and treadmill exercise (235 +/- 17 ms). The retrograde accessory pathway refractory period also showed a significant decrease (supine 272 +/- 16, isometric 267 +/- 23, standing 249 +/- 15, treadmill 237 +/- 17 ms; p less than 0.05). The relative change in refractory periods was greater when patients changed from lying down to standing than when they changed from standing to treadmill exercise, despite obvious higher adrenergic neuronal activities during exercise. These findings suggest that testing the accessory pathway during free standing can give a reliable indication of the sensitivity of the accessory pathway to sympathetic stimulation. 
Continuous arteriovenous rewarming: report of a new technique for treating hypothermia. Survival is rare after major trauma if core temperature falls below 32 degrees C. Available rewarming methods are often ineffective. We utilized arterial and venous catheters to create a circulatory fistula through the heating mechanism of a modified commercially available counter-current fluid warmer to achieve simple, rapid extracorporeal rewarming. 
Misoprostol compared with sucralfate in the prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastric ulcer. A randomized, controlled trial. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy and frequency of adverse experiences of misoprostol and sucralfate in the prevention of gastric ulcers in patients receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, single-blind, multicenter trial. PATIENTS: Patients with osteoarthritis receiving treatment with ibuprofen, piroxicam, or naproxen and experiencing abdominal pain were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Patients who were expected to receive at least 3 months of NSAID therapy and who did not have a gastric ulcer at the time of the initial screening endoscopy were randomized to receive misoprostol, 200 micrograms four times a day, or sucralfate, 1 g four times a day. A gastric ulcer was defined as a lesion of the gastric mucosa 0.3 cm or greater in diameter. Patients were followed clinically, and repeat endoscopies were performed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks. MAIN MEASUREMENT: The development of a gastric ulcer, which was regarded as a prophylaxis failure. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three patients were evaluable for efficacy analysis. A gastric ulcer developed in 2 of the 122 (1.6%, 95% CI, 0.3% to 6.4%) patients on misoprostol, compared with 21 of 131 patients on sucralfate (16%, CI, 10.4% to 23.7%). The difference in ulcer rates was 14.4% (CI, 10.4% to 19.5%; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: In patients receiving chronic NSAID therapy for osteoarthritis, treatment with misoprostol for 3 months was associated with a significantly lower frequency of gastric ulcer formation, compared with treatment with sucralfate (P less than 0.001). 
Characterization of the proliferative response of a CD4-8- thymic T lymphoma cell line to stimulation by thymic cellular elements. E710.2 is a cloned T cell line that was isolated from an AKR/J thymic tumor. This clone expresses Thy-1, heat-stable Ag, and the CD3/TCR complex but does not express CD4 or CD8. When the E710.2 cell line is injected into syngeneic mice, it grows as a malignant tumor in lymphoid organs and the thymus. In contrast, this cell line does not grow in vitro under standard culture conditions. This latter property allowed us to analyze the in vitro responsiveness of this CD4-CD8- cell line to stimulation by pharmacologic agents and cellular elements from the spleen and thymus. E710.2 cells proliferate when stimulated with phorbol esters or when cocultured with thymocytes or splenocytes. We could not detect soluble stimulatory factors in cultures of E710.2 and/or lymphoid cells, suggesting that cell contact might be required for this response. The stimulatory activity in thymus and spleen appears to be broadly expressed, because all cell subsets that were examined from these tissues stimulate this cell line. The stimulation of E710.2 cells is not MHC-restricted and is not inhibited by anti-MHC mAb. Furthermore, the responsiveness of these cells is not decreased when the TCR/CD3 complex is modulated from the cell surface. Similarly, TCR/CD3-deficient E710.2 variant clones retain their responsiveness to thymic and splenic cell stimulation. These findings suggest that there is a TCR-independent pathway of activation in E710.2 that is stimulated by a broadly expressed, non-MHC-encoded molecules(s). 
Coexpression of CD4 and CD8 on peripheral blood T cells and lamina propria T cells in inflammatory bowel disease by two colour immunofluorescence and flow cytometric analysis. Using two colour immunofluorescence with fluorescein isothiocyanate and phycoerythrin labelled monoclonal antibodies and multiparameter flow cytometry, we investigated the coexpression of CD4 and CD8 antigens on peripheral blood lymphocytes and lamina propria lymphocytes of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease and normal control subjects. Both the absolute number and the proportion of peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ cells in inflammatory bowel disease were small but significantly increased compared with those in normal control subjects. Peripheral blood lymphocytes activated with phytohaemagglutinin showed appreciably increased coexpression of CD4+, CD8+. These CD4, CD8 positive cells were large and granular. Thus the increased number of peripheral blood CD4+, CD8+ cells in inflammatory bowel disease suggests that chronic immune activation occurs not only in the active state of the disease but also in remission. The proportion of CD4+, CD8+ cells in the lamina propria was greater than in peripheral blood in normal subjects, suggesting chronic immune stimulation of the local immune system. This was also seen in patients with Crohn's disease or inactive ulcerative colitis. The proportion of CD4+, CD8+ cells was, however, significantly less in the lamina propria of patients with active ulcerative colitis. Whether this implies a possible defect in mucosal immunoregulation in active ulcerative colitis cannot be determined from these results. 
The clinical and endocrine outcome to trans-sphenoidal microsurgery of nonsecreting pituitary adenomas. From 1962 to 1987, 126 patients underwent trans-sphenoidal surgery for primary treatment of pituitary adenomas unassociated with clinical or biochemical evidence of hormonal overproduction. There were 73 male and 53 female patients (mean age, 50 +/- 12 years). Before surgery, 56% of the patients (70 of 124) had headaches, 74% (94 of 126) had deterioration of vision, and 12% (15 of 126) had ophthalmoplegia. Endocrine evaluation revealed the presence of hypogonadism in 75% (87 of 115), adrenal insufficiency in 36% (46 of 126), and hypothyroidism in 18% (21 of 122). Plasma prolactin was increased in 65% (56 of 86) with a mean level of 39 +/- 14 micrograms/l (normal, 3 to 20 micrograms/l). Radiologic enlargement of the sella turcica was documented in all cases: 67% (84 of 126) had enclosed and 33% (42 of 126) had invasive adenomas. After surgery, vision was normalized or improved in 75% (71 of 94) of the patients. Thyroid, adrenal, and gonadal functions were improved in 14% (three of 22), 41% (19 of 46), 11% (ten of 87), were unchanged in 82% (100 of 122), 77% (97 of 126), 89% (102 of 115), and worsened in 15% (19 of 22), 8% (ten of 126), 3% (102 of 115), respectively. Permanent diabetes insipidus occurred in 5% (seven of 126). Two patients died during the immediate postoperative period. The recurrence rate in patients with a mean follow-up of 6.4 +/- 4.2 years was 21% (15 of 71). These data indicate that trans-sphenoidal microsurgery is an effective and safe initial treatment for patients with nonsecreting pituitary adenoma and may reverse hypopituitarism. 
Inhibitory effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on mucosal cell proliferation associated with gastric ulcer healing To find out whether non-steroidial anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit the proliferation of mucosal cells that normally leads to healing of gastric ulcers a microdissection technique was used to quantify mitosis in gastric glands at the ulcer edge in relation to that in the adjacent mucosa. The regeneration index thus obtained of the ulcer edge was greater in the 9 subjects with gastric ulcers not taking NSAIDs (mean index 3.1 [SEM 0.61]) than that in the 8 patients taking NSAIDs (index 1.49 [0.16]). In rats in which gastric ulcers were produced with a cryoprobe, the ulcers were larger and slower to heal in those receiving indomethacin than in controls; also, immunohistochemical staining indicated significantly fewer mitotic cells in glands adjacent to the ulcer in indomethacin-treated rats (8 mitoses [SEM 3]) than in control animals (25 [5]). The prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol reversed the inhibition of healing and substantially restored the proliferative rate in the animals. Inhibition of epithelial cell division normally involved in gastric ulcer healing would contribute to the high prevalence of gastric ulcer during NSAID therapy. 
Relation of arteriographically defined coronary artery disease to serum lipoprotein particles mapped with monoclonal antibodies. BACKGROUND. This study was designed to investigate the relation of a molecular analysis of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing atherogenic lipoprotein particles to coronary artery disease (CAD) in middle-aged men. METHODS AND RESULTS. Two groups of men were studied. The first consisted of 97 patients with angiographically documented CAD (greater than 50% stenosis of at least one coronary artery). The second group consisted of 145 subjects without symptomatic CAD, who served as controls. In both groups, measurements were obtained for total cholesterol level, triglyceride level, cholesterol contents in apoB- and nonapoB-containing particles (LpB, LpnonB), total apoB and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI levels), lipoprotein particles recognized by monoclonal antibodies anti-apoB (LpBL3, LpBL5, LpBL7) and anti-apoAI (LpAI-2GII). Taking into account age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking habits, and drug consumption, the analysis showed that the mean levels of cholesterol were identical in both groups but differed when cholesterol content in LpB and LpnonB subfractions were assessed, thus reflecting an increase in the low density fraction and a decrease in the high density fraction, respectively. This was confirmed by an increase in total apoB and a decrease in total apoAI. Measurements of LpBL3, LpBL5, LpBL7, and LpAI-2GII particles also discriminated between the two groups. After adjustment for cholesterol content in LpnonB particles, a difference in total apoB was no longer significant between groups, whereas LpBL3, LpBL5, and LpBL7 levels remained significantly higher in CAD patients. CONCLUSIONS. The measurement of separate concentrations of apoB in different particles may permit a more-accurate assessment of CAD risk than measurements of total apoB levels. 
Clinical significance of pericardial rub with regional ventricular dilatation. To elucidate the clinical characteristics associated with regional ventricular dilatation in the early phase of myocardial infarction (MI), 228 patients with acute Q-wave anterior MI were studied. Forty-nine patients (21 percent) had echocardiographically demonstrated regional ventricular dilatation (an abnormal bulge in the left ventricular contour during both systole and diastole) on the third hospital day. Careful auscultation revealed that a pericardial rub was present in 49 patients (21 patients with and 28 patients without regional ventricular dilatation) during the first three days after hospital admission. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of pericardial rub with six other clinical variables related to regional ventricular dilatation. Pericardial rub and cardiac output were the significant factors related to the presence of regional ventricular dilatation. Thus, a pericardial rub, in concert with impaired left ventricular function, is a physical sign associated with regional ventricular dilatation, and anatomically transmural infarction is the possible factor explaining their association. 
Diagnosis and management of systemic Wegener's granulomatosis presenting with anterior ocular inflammatory disease. The ocular and systemic features of 10 patients whose Wegener's granulomatosis presented with corneoscleral inflammatory disease are described. Marginal corneal infiltrates were seen in all patients with anterior scleritis and were a valuable sign of disease activity. Nine out of 10 patients had symptoms of systemic vasculitis on presentation; seven had renal impairment; three had chest x-ray abnormalities. Autoantibodies against neutrophil cytoplasmic determinants (ANCA) were present in all cases. In seven patients the scleritis responded well to pulsed immunosuppressive therapy followed by long term oral steroids and cyclophosphamide. Oral steroid therapy alone failed to control severe disease. Corneoscleral disease was not a cause of visual loss. It is important to realise that inflammatory corneoscleral disease may be the presenting feature of a severe systemic vasculitis. 
Chronic anterior uveitis in leprosy: an insidious cause of blindness. Chronic low grade anterior uveitis is the commonest cause of blindness in leprosy. It is usually asymptomatic until the late stages, and often patients seek help only after irreversible visual impairment has occurred. We present herewith several cases of this entity to emphasise the insidious nature of the disease, the extent of ocular damage it can cause, and the importance of early detection and treatment. 
Retinoid-mediated transcriptional regulation of keratin genes in human epidermal and squamous cell carcinoma cells. Vitamin A and other retinoids profoundly inhibit morphological and biochemical features of epidermal differentiation in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential expression of epidermal keratins and their regulation by retinoids, we examined retinoid-mediated changes in total protein expression, protein synthesis, mRNA expression, and transcription in cultured human keratinocytes and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC-13) cells of epidermal origin. Our studies revealed that the epidermal keratins, K5, K6, K14, and K16, their mRNAs, and their transcripts were diminished relative to actin as a consequence of retinoic acid (RA) treatment. The effects were most pronounced in SCC-13 and were detected as early as 6 hr post-RA treatment, with enhancement over an additional 24-48 hr. Repression was also observed when 5' upstream sequences of K14 or K5 genes were used to drive expression of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in SCC-13 keratinocytes. Both cell types were found to express mRNAs for the RA receptors alpha and gamma, which may be involved in the RA-mediated transcriptional changes in these cells. The rapid transcriptional changes in epidermal keratin genes were in striking contrast to the previously reported slow transcriptional changes in simple epithelial keratin genes. 
A clinicopathologic study of node-based, low-grade, peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Angioimmunoblastic lymphoma, T-zone lymphoma, and lymphoepithelioid lymphoma. Postthymic (peripheral) T-cell malignancy shows marked diversity in histopathologic appearances as well as in clinical and prognostic aspects. Histologic findings and clinical behavior of 110 cases of the three specific types of low-grade, peripheral T-cell lymphomas, i.e., lymphoepithelioid (LeL), angioimmunoblastic (AILD), and T-zone (TzL) lymphomas, were studied. There were 74 men and 36 women (age range, 24 to 90 years; median, 58). Histologic study of LeL, AILD, and TzL showed prominent reactive features which are distinct from those of high-grade, T-cell lymphomas (pleomorphic/immunoblastic types). Corresponding to the differences in the histologic pictures of each type, there were differences in the clinical pictures and prognosis. Hypergammablobulinemia (greater than 4 g/dl) was more common in AILD than in the others. However, these three types exhibited a widely variegated, sometimes overlapping spectrum of histologic appearances, and it was extremely difficult to distinguish one from the other on several occasions. The same was true of their clinical and laboratory findings, and they had a relatively favorable prognosis as compared with pleomorphic/immunoblastic lymphomas. Although the conventional phenotypic analysis showed the prominent mixture of helper/inducer and cytotoxic/suppressor T-cells with a varying degree of B-cells and histiocytes, the double immunohistochemical study revealed that the neoplastic cells consisted predominantly of helper/inducer cells. Furthermore, five cases (5%) showed the morphologic transition among the three types or development into pleomorphic/immunoblastic lymphoma. They seemed to constitute a comprehensive and yet distinct group of T-cell lymphomas. Based on morphologic findings and clinical data, the authors demonstrated the distinct character of the node-based, low-grade, T-cell lymphomas and also the relationship among the three types in this group. The results of phenotypic and genotypic analyses also support the concept proposed here. 
A new anticancer drug delivery system for the management of carcinomatous peritonitis. To develop a new drug delivery system for the treatment of carcinomatous peritonitis, we constructed 5-fluorouracil poly L-microcapsules (5Fu-mc) by the organic phase separation technique and examined their drug-releasing capacities and anticancer effects. The microcapsules consisted of in vitro dissolvable polymolecular poly L-lactic acid and 5-fluorouracil (5Fu). The 5Fu-mc was about 200 microns in diameter and had a 5Fu content of about 40% (weight/weight). 5Fu-release time from the microcapsules was about 50 hours in vitro and about 48 hours in vivo. After the release of the 5Fu, the poly L-lactic acid was metabolized very slowly in the peritoneal cavity. The 5Fu-mc caused fewer side effects than the equivalent dose of a 5Fu solution. In addition, macroscopic and microscopic examinations of various abdominal organs revealed no toxic effects from the microcapsules. After administration of 5Fu-mc into the abdominal cavity of rats with AH-130 carcinomatous peritonitis, the 5Fu concentration remained at a high level for an extended period in the ascites but fell rapidly to low levels in the plasma. In conclusion, the present studies indicated that the 5Fu-mc were much more effective in prolonging the life of tumor-bearing hosts while producing less systemic side effects than a 5Fu solution. 
New recurring chromosomal translocations in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We identified seven new recurring translocations among 483 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with adequate chromosome banding studies. Four were apparently balanced [t(1;3)(p34;p21), t(7;9)(p15;p23-p24), t(12;13)(p13;q14), t(17;19)(q22;p13)], while three were unbalanced with the formation of a dicentric chromosome [dic(7;9)(p13;p11), dic(7;12)(p11;p12), and dic(12;17)(p11;p11-p12)]. One translocation was observed in five cases, two in four cases, and the remaining four in two cases each. The modal chromosome numbers in these 21 cases were 45 (n = 11), 46 (n = 8), and 47 (n = 2). Eight of the 11 cases with a dicentric chromosome had a modal number of 45. Only a single translocation was found in 14 cases (67%), representing the sole structural abnormality in six cases. In three of the seven translocation subgroups, the blast cells were consistently of B lineage (pre-B, early pre-B, or both); in all others, they represented both the B and T lineages. The small size of these subgroups prevented definitive clinical correlations, although it may be important that two of the four cases with a t(17;19) and an early pre-B-cell immunophenotype had disseminated intravascular coagulation, an event usually observed in acute promyelocytic leukemia or T-cell ALL. These findings add substantially to the existing list of nonrandom chromosomal translocations in childhood ALL and may help to explain the genetic alterations leading to the loss of normal growth control mechanisms in this disease. 
Surgical treatment of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome by epicardial electrical ablation A new operation to eliminate accessory pathways--epicardial electrical ablation--is described. In a group of 201 patients without concomitant disease, the mortality rate was 0.5% and the overall efficacy of the operation for free wall accessory pathways, 98%. A retrospective clinical study of 44 unselected patients was performed to examine how safe epicardial electrical ablation is. The criteria for intraoperative effectiveness were disappearance of both the delta wave and retrograde conduction and inability to induce tachycardia. In the postoperative and follow-up periods, the following were reviewed: electrocardiograms; Holter monitor recordings (24 to 26 hours); release of the myocardial-specific isoenzyme of creatine kinase; intracardiac hemodynamics and myocardial contractility (radionuclide methods); selective coronary arteriograms and ventriculograms; mean work capacity (bicycle ergometer); diagnostic transesophageal electrical stimulation; and histology of the area of ablation. The main conclusion of this study is that epicardial electrical ablation is a highly efficient and safe operation for surgical elimination of parietal accessory pathways in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Its advantages are its technical simplicity and the opportunity to review results immediately during the operation. 
Proportionate mortality trends: 1950 through 1986 Mortality trends in the United States from 1950 through 1986 were analyzed for the conditions that are or have recently been among the six leading causes of death. The age-adjusted mortality rate for all causes has decreased from 841.5 to 541.7 per 100,000 population. Cause-specific, age-adjusted mortality rates have declined from 1950 through 1986 for cerebrovascular disease, injuries, perinatal conditions, heart disease, and influenza and pneumonia. Time trends in the proportion of persons dying of each of these diseases, however, have varied; the proportion dying of cerebrovascular disease, injuries, and perinatal conditions has decreased, and the proportion of persons dying of heart disease and influenza and pneumonia has remained fairly stable from 1950 through 1986. During this same time, age-adjusted death rates have increased for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and have remained fairly stable for malignant neoplasms, while the proportions of persons dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and malignant neoplasms have increased dramatically. For people aged 35 to 64 years, malignant neoplasms have now overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death. For those aged 65 years and older, heart disease remains the leading cause of death, accounting for almost 50% of all deaths in persons 85 years and older. 
Hyperoxia prevents hypoxia-induced bronchial hyperreactivity via a cyclooxygenase-independent mechanism. We tested the hypothesis that prior exposure to alveolar hyperoxia prevents the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity, possibly via a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism. In 15 sheep, specific lung resistance (sRL) was measured before and after 30 min of exposure to either air or a hypoxic gas mixture (13% O2). The sheep then inhaled 50 breaths of aerosolized 5% histamine solution (n = 9) or 10 breaths of 2.5% carbachol solution (n = 9), and measurements of sRL were repeated. On subsequent days the above protocols were repeated after a 30-min exposure to hyperoxia (O2 greater than or equal to 95%), without or after pretreatment with indomethacin (2 mg/kg). After air-sham exposure, carbachol and histamine increased mean sRL to 370 +/- 40 (SE) and 309 +/- 65% of baseline, respectively. Exposure to the hypoxic gas mixture had no effect on baseline sRL but enhanced the airway responsiveness to carbachol and histamine; mean sRL increased to 740 +/- 104 and 544 +/- 76% of baseline, respectively (P less than 0.05). Prior 30-min exposure to hyperoxia prevented the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity to carbachol (sRL = 416 +/- 66% of baseline) and histamine (sRL = 292 +/- 41% of baseline) without affecting the airway responsiveness to these agents after air. Pretreatment with indomethacin did not reverse the protective effects of hyperoxia or the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity. We conclude that 1) prior exposure to alveolar hyperoxia prevents the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity and 2) neither the protective effects of hyperoxia nor the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity is mediated via a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism. 
Pathophysiology of myocardial perfusion in hypertension. Chronic and acute hypertension have multiple untoward effects on the coronary circulation, several of which may either mimic or markedly worsen the clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease. Early after the onset of left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, coronary vasodilator reserve is significantly impaired. During cardiac hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, the coronary arteries fail to enlarge in concert with ventricular enlargement. This failure results in a relative decrease by approximately 50% in the ratio of epicardial vessel diameter to the mass of myocardium perfused. The lower range of coronary subendocardial autoregulation is altered by chronic renovascular hypertension. A variety of vascular smooth muscle homeostatic mechanisms are abnormal in genetic models of hypertension, as is endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. Acute hypertension may enhance constriction to serotonin, most likely through the release of potent vasoconstrictor substances from leukocytes and platelets that adhere to the endothelium as a result of endothelial damage. Finally, many of the consequences of myocardial infarction are worsened in the setting of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Homing and progression patterns of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias in severe combined immunodeficiency mice. The aim of this study was to analyze the homing and progression patterns of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL) in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Upon intraperitoneal (IP) transfer, cells from relapse samples of three children with T-lineage ALL spread hematogenously and infiltrated the non-lymphoid and/or lymphoid organs with a pattern reminiscent of the human clinical disease. These mice either died or were killed in extremis at a mean of 9 weeks. Moreover, cell lines established in vitro from two of these samples manifested identical homing and progression in the SCID mouse as compared with the original patients' cells. Thus, long-term culture of the primary leukemic T cells did not alter their invasive potential and migration pattern. When engrafted IP, three cell lines established from pre-B-ALL cases displayed primarily a lymphatic spread with induction of local tumor masses and kidney/liver nodules. Mice were killed at 11 to 13 weeks, but had not developed imminently fatal leukemia. However, when transferred intravenously, one pre-B ALL cell line was able to spread hematogenously and to infiltrate both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Overall, these data demonstrate that the SCID mouse provides an efficient and reproducible model to study the pathogenesis of childhood ALL, and may be a suitable system for evaluating therapy. 
Hemilaryngectomy for salvage of radiation therapy failures. Radiation therapy has been the treatment most frequently used for early vocal cord cancer with surgery usually in the form of total laryngectomy held in reserve as a salvage option. We report our experience in selected patients who, having failed radiation therapy for their early vocal cord cancers, underwent frontolateral hemilaryngectomy as attempted salvage surgery. Between 1977 and 1986, fourteen patients at the University of Pittsburgh Eye and Ear Hospital underwent hemilaryngectomy for salvage of their stage I vocal cord squamous cell carcinoma after full-course radiation therapy had been unsuccessful. Over this same time period, 77 patients underwent total laryngectomy for salvage of radiation therapy failure. Three patients failed hemilaryngectomy, two of whom were ultimately salvaged with total laryngectomy. Thus a 79% salvage rate was achieved with hemilaryngectomy with an average followup of 90 months. The overall cure rate was 93% (13 of 14) with voice preservation in 86% (12 of 14). Decannulation, postoperative infection, and initiation of oral intake were not influenced by age. Such problems occurred more often in patients undergoing radiation therapy compared to those undergoing hemilaryngectomy without previous radiation therapy. These results indicate that hemilaryngectomy may be used for the salvage of radiation therapy failures of stage I vocal cord carcinoma with good success and without undue morbidity. 
Orthostatic vital signs in emergency department patients. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the variability and define the normal ranges of orthostatic vital signs in an emergency department population. DESIGN: Descriptive. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Adult ED patients with no history of recent blood or fluid losses. MEASUREMENTS: Lying and standing heart rate and blood pressure measured by an automated instrument. RESULTS: In 132 presumed euvolemic patients, the statistical normal ranges (mean +/- 2 SD) of orthostatic vital signs were wide: on standing, the heart rate range was from decreases 5.0 to increases 39.4 beats per minute; for systolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 20 to increases 25.7 mm Hg; and for diastolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 6.4 to increases 24.9 mm Hg. In this sample, 43% had "positive" orthostatic vital signs according to currently accepted values. CONCLUSION: The data from this study indicate that there is a wider than expected variation in orthostatic vital signs among presumed euvolemic ED patients. 
Depression of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity characterizes patients with early myocardial reinfarction after recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator therapy. Twenty patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) had endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels measured throughout the hospital period and those levels were prospectively correlated with the incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction until 8 weeks after hospital discharge. Within the follow-up period, recurrent myocardial infarction was observed in 8 patients, whereas the remaining 12 patients showed no clinical evidence of recurrence. The patients in the reinfarction group were characterized by a more pronounced depletion of and sustained lower levels of factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity than were the patients with no reinfarction (p less than 0.05). The decrease in fibrinolytic activity during rt-PA therapy was significantly associated with a depletion of functional alpha 2-antiplasmin, the primary plasmin inhibitor. These results indicate that, paradoxically, coronary thrombolysis with rt-PA involves depletion of endogenous factor XII-dependent fibrinolytic activity levels, which constitutes a risk for early myocardial reinfarction. 
Ig repertoire of human polyspecific antibodies and B cell ontogeny. A total of 463 EBV Ig-secreting clones were derived from embryonic tissues, cord blood, and adult peripheral blood. Subcloning and analysis of the H and K loci (germline vs rearranged DNA status) of 44 primary clones insured clonality in at least 92% of cases. Whatever the cell origin, a somewhat constant proportion of clones (i.e., 11 to 16%) expressed polyspecific antibodies when tested on a panel of nine Ag, including self-Ag. The VH and VK repertoires have been studied using VH1-VH6 and VK1-VK4 family-specific probes. For all EBV clones the VH and VK utilization was similar to that of the normal untransformed population. A correlation was observed between the level of expression and the gene number for VH, whereas a clear distortion appeared for VK. Moreover, the usage pattern of VH and VK families of the polyspecific clones did not significantly differ from that of clones of unknown specificity, suggesting that polyspecificity was not linked to a restricted repertoire. 
Prospective randomized evaluation of two regimens for converting from continuous to intermittent feedings in patients with feeding gastrostomies. Forty enterally fed male patients were randomized to one of two regimens designed to determine the better means of converting them from continuous to intermittent enteral feedings. All patients received a nutritionally complete iso-osmolal 1 kcal/cc formula containing 6 g of nitrogen/L beginning on the second postgastrostomy day. Half of the patients (20) were randomized to a discontinuous regimen abruptly changing from continuous to gradually increasing intermittent feedings until reaching their nutritional goals. Intravenous fluids were given to maintain normal fluid balance. The other 20 patients were randomized to an overlapping regimen, receiving continuous feedings at a decreasing rate while intermittent feedings were progressively increased. Intravenous fluids were used during the first three stages only. There were no significant differences (p less than 0.05) in major diagnosis, type of gastrostomy, age, weight, height, admission or discharge serum albumin concentration, calculated basal energy expenditure (BEE), or nutrient goals (1.5 X BEE, 1.5 g of protein/kg per day). 
First-pass nuclear magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadolinium-DTPA in patients with coronary artery disease. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging has been shown to accurately portray cardiac anatomy and function. To investigate the potential of NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary stenosis in patients with chest pain, ultrafast NMR imaging in conjunction with a T1 (longitudinal relaxation time) contrast agent was performed in 17 patients with chest pain who had undergone cardiac catheterization. These included 12 patients with significant coronary artery stenoses and 4 who underwent repeat NMR study after myocardial revascularization. Cardiac images at rest were obtained during rapid intravenous injection of gadolinium-DTPA (0.04 mM/kg). Electrocardiographic-gated images were acquired over 380 ms, with repetitive images obtained every 3 to 4 s. After contrast injection, there was pronounced signal enhancement in the right ventricular cavity, followed by enhancement in the left ventricular cavity and myocardium. Regional myocardium perfused by a diseased vessel demonstrated a lower peak signal intensity (p = 0.001) and lower rate of signal increase (p = 0.001) than did myocardium perfused by coronary arteries without stenosis. Repeat NMR study after revascularization showed an increase in peak signal intensity (p less than 0.002). These results demonstrate the clinical potential of dynamic gadolinium-DTPA-enhanced NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain. In combination with anatomic and functional NMR imaging, this technique has the potential to provide a comprehensive noninvasive cardiac evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. 
Severe 5-fluorouracil toxicity secondary to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency. A potentially more common pharmacogenetic syndrome. This study describes the inheritance of a defect in pyrimidine catabolism and its association with drug-induced toxicity in a patient receiving 5-fluorouracil (FUra) as adjuvant chemotherapy for breast carcinoma. The study population included the affected patient (proband), nine of her blood relatives, and seven healthy volunteers. The activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), the initial enzyme of pyrimidine (and FUra) catabolism, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured in each subject by a specific radiometric assay using FUra as the substrate. The proband had no detectable DPD activity. When enzyme levels in the proband and relatives were compared with that in controls, an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance was demonstrated. This is the third patient with severe FUra toxicity secondary to an alteration in pyrimidine catabolism and the second from our clinic population suggesting that the frequency of this genetic defect may be greater than previously thought. Monitoring DPD activity may be important in the management of patients experiencing severe toxicity secondary to FUra chemotherapy. 
Characterization of liver epithelial cells transfected with myc and/or ras oncogenes. While many liver tumors contain activated myc and ras oncogenes, the mechanisms by which these genes contribute to cellular transformation is poorly understood. Activated versions of the cellular oncogenes, c-myc and/or c-H-ras were transfected into normal rat liver epithelial cells to identify cellular pathways that are altered in the cells containing the oncogenes. The results of these and other investigations indicate that the biological properties associated with the transfection of c-myc include immortalization, reduced contact inhibition of growth, activation of phospholipase A2-mediated pathways, increased sensitivity to transformation with a ras gene, and greatly increased sensitivity to growth factors. The biological properties associated with the transfection of the ras gene include morphological transformation, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenicity, increased phosphatidylinositol metabolism, the induction of growth-factor processing and secretion, which leads to (exogenous) growth factor-independent tumor growth, and a marked resistance to normal inhibitors of growth such as TGF-beta. It is proposed that the complementary actions of the myc and ras genes in cellular transformation may be related to the ras-induced secretion of autocrine growth factors by cells sensitized to their effects by the myc gene. The increased stimulus for growth coupled to a ras-induced insensitivity to growth inhibitors may lead to clonal expansion of these cells and tumor development. 
Necrolytic migratory erythema: dyskeratotic dermatitis, a clue to early diagnosis. A 57-year-old woman with a 6-year history of a dermatitis that evolved into typical necrolytic migratory erythema is reported. Four biopsy specimens were obtained in 5 years. The early lesions revealed superficial perivascular inflammation in the dermis, minor epidermal spongiosis, and scattered dyskeratotic cells in the upper epidermis. The differential diagnosis of this pattern of dyskeratotic dermatitis, particularly in a chronic eruption, should include consideration of hyperglucagonemia and the possibility of an associated pancreatic islet cell tumor. 
Correlation of occult clonogenic leukemia drug sensitivity with relapse after autologous bone marrow transplantation. Despite initial complete remission rates exceeding 70%, the majority of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and adults with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) eventually relapse. Improving the therapeutic results in acute leukemia requires detecting, and understanding the biology of, the minimal residual leukemia remaining after therapy and responsible for relapse. To investigate the biologic relevance of an in vitro assay for clonogenic leukemia (leukemia colony-forming units [CFU-L]) as a measure of minimal residual leukemia, we studied 58 consecutive patients with acute leukemia in complete remission undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with cyclophosphamide-based therapy. CFU-L were cultured from the pretransplant remission marrows in 45 of 58 patients: 35 of 43 patients with AML and 10 of 15 with ALL. Clonal rearrangements, identical to the patients' overt leukemia when available, were detected in the occult CFU-L from four of the eight patients with ALL in whom adequate DNA for analysis could be obtained from the CFU-L. None of the uncultured pretransplant remission marrows from the 15 ALL patients showed clonal gene rearrangements. We also determined the in vitro sensitivity of the occult CFU-L to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC), and correlated these results with the outcome of the patients. The sensitivity of the occult CFU-L to 4HC was the only factor that predicted relapse following BMT. The actuarial probability of relapse was 18% in the 23 patients whose CFU-L were sensitive to 4HC compared with 77% in the 22 patients whose CFU-L were resistant (P less than .001). The only factor that influenced the CFU-L sensitivity to 4HC was the type of leukemia. The CFU-L from the AML patients were more sensitive to 4HC than the CFU-L from the ALL patients (P = .001). Occult CFU-L genetically and functionally represent occult leukemia. Therefore, the CFU-L assay should provide a means for studying the biology of minimal residual leukemia and improving the therapeutic results in patients with acute leukemia. 
Intraoperative colonic lavage and primary anastomosis in nonelective colon resection. In selected individuals requiring emergency colon resection, intraoperative colonic lavage with primary anastomosis represents a safe alternative to staged reconstruction. This procedure achieves excellent mechanical preparation of the colon, facilitates safe anastomosis, and avoids the disadvantages associated with multistaged operations. At our institution, 25 patients requiring urgent segmental resection of the left colon have undergone intraoperative colonic lavage. Primary anastomosis without fecal diversion has been performed in 21 of these patients. Obstruction of the large intestine was the indication for operation in 56 percent of the patients in this series. Ten patients (40 percent) required laparotomy for an acute intra-abdominal inflammatory process. No post-operative deaths have occurred in our series, and no patient has sustained clinically evident anastomotic leakage. A pelvic abscess developed in one patient after sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis. Three patients required treatment for wound infection. Based on our results, we recommend resection with intraoperative colonic lavage and primary anastomosis as the preferred treatment for the majority of patients requiring nonelective segmental left colon resection. 
Scrapie-infected spleens: analysis of infectivity, scrapie-associated fibrils, and protease-resistant proteins. Scrapie-associated fibrils (SAF) and protease-resistant proteins (PrP) were isolated from spleens and brains of clinical animals (mice and hamsters) from three scrapie agent-host strain combinations, and their concentrations were compared with infectivity levels. The spleens of infected animals contained lower levels of infectivity, PrP, and SAF than did brains. Regardless of the route of infection, both SAF and infectivity were detected in spleen before brain. Infectivity increased in brains and spleens of 139A-infected mice before the detection and increase in SAF, suggesting that the synthesis of SAF and PrP may not be the limiting factor in agent replication. In contrast to those in ME7- and 263K-infected animals, the Western blot profiles for PrP from brain and spleen of 139A-infected mice exhibited distinct differences. Results indicate that SAF and PrP found in the spleens are both organ- and scrapie strain-specific. 
Randomized study on the effect of collagen impregnation of knitted Dacron velour aortoiliac prostheses on blood loss during aortic reconstruction. Intraoperative blood loss is an important factor in reconstructive surgery for aortoiliac disease because it is clearly associated with an increase in the operative morbidity and mortality rates. To minimize intraoperative blood loss, a blood-tight vascular prosthesis has been developed by impregnating a knitted Dacron prosthesis with bovine collagen. To study a potential reduction of intraoperative blood loss using these collagen-impregnated prostheses, we conducted a prospective randomized trial involving the collagen-impregnated prosthesis and its non-impregnated substrate, the Dacron knitted non-impregnated prosthesis. During a 2.5-year period, 123 consecutive patients (undergoing 81 procedures for aneurysmal disease and 43 procedures for occlusive disease) were admitted for elective aortic reconstructive surgery. Equal numbers of the two prostheses were randomly implanted. Various parameters were monitored: intraoperative blood loss before aortic cross-clamping (phase 1), during implantation of the prosthesis (phase 2) and after release of aorta cross-clamping (phase 3); the number of intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusions; and, finally, all preoperative and intraoperative factors that might contribute to intraoperative blood loss. A significant overall difference in intraoperative blood loss between the collagen-impregnated (2425 ml) and the non-impregnated (1907 ml) group was found (P = 0.003). However, this difference could not be attributed to collagen impregnation because no statistically significant difference in blood loss was found in the relevant period of operation (phase 3). Similar results were observed in patients operated on for both aneurysmal and occlusive disease (2600 versus 2195 ml and 2105 versus 1344 ml respectively). 
Profound hypothermia (less than 10 degrees C) compared with deep hypothermia (15 degrees C) improves neurologic outcome in dogs after two hours' circulatory arrest induced to enable resuscitative surgery. Deaths from uncontrollable hemorrhage might be prevented by arresting the circulation under protective hypothermia to allow resuscitative surgery to repair these injuries in a bloodless field. We have shown previously that in hemorrhagic shock, circulatory arrest of 60 minutes under deep hypothermia (tympanic membrane temperature, Ttm = 15 degrees C) was the maximum duration of arrest that allowed normal brain recovery. We hypothesize that profound cerebral hypothermia (Ttm less than 10 degrees C) could extend the duration of safe circulatory arrest. In pilot experiments, we found that the cardiopulmonary system did not tolerate arrest at a core (esophageal) temperature (Tes) of less than 10 degrees C. Twenty-two dogs underwent 30-minute hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure 40 mm Hg), rapid cooling by cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), blood washout to a hematocrit of less than 10%, and circulatory arrest of 2 hours. In deep hypothermia group 1 (n = 10), Ttm was maintained at 15 degrees C during arrest. In profound hypothermia group 2 (n = 12), during cooling with CPB, the head was immersed in ice water, which decreased Ttm to 4 degrees-7 degrees C. The Tes was 10 degrees C in all dogs during arrest. Reperfusion and rewarming were by CPB for 2 hours. Controlled ventilation was to 24 hours, intensive care to 72 hours. In the 20 dogs that followed protocol, best neurologic deficit scores (0% = normal, 100% = brain death) at 24-72 hours were 23% +/- 19% in group 1 and 12% +/- 8% in group 2 (p = 0.15). Overall performance categories and histologic damage scores were significantly better in group 2 (p = 0.04 and p less than 0.001, respectively). We conclude that profound cerebral hypothermia with CPB plus ice water immersion of the head can extend the brain's tolerance of therapeutic circulatory arrest beyond that achieved with deep hypothermia. 
A clinicopathologic study of 153 cases of complete hydatidiform mole (1980-1990): histologic grade lacks prognostic significance. Although the significance of histologic grading in hydatidiform mole has previously been investigated, most studies evaluated patients treated before 1975. Since 1975, many advances have been made in the understanding and treatment of hydatidiform mole, including the division of molar pregnancy into complete and partial hydatidiform mole. We retrospectively studied 153 cases of complete hydatidiform mole diagnosed and treated at the Brigham and Women's Hospital between 1980-1990 to determine the current prognostic significance of histologic grading in this disease. The histologic grade (based on the criteria of Hertig and Sheldon) was compared with the subsequent clinical course, including the rates of spontaneous remission, persistent gestational trophoblastic tumor, metastatic disease, "high-risk" metastatic disease, chemotherapy resistance, and survival. The histologic grade of the original complete hydatidiform mole did not correlate significantly with any index of clinical outcome evaluated. 
Granulomatous vasculitis occurring after cutaneous herpes zoster despite absence of viral genome. Granuloma annulare, sarcoidal and other granulomatous dermatitides, pseudolymphoma, lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma have been described as sequelae of herpes zoster. We report a new postzoster reaction, granulomatous vasculitis, that caused flat-topped papules restricted to the affected dermatome. Polymerase chain reaction failed to detect varicella-zoster virus in a biopsy specimen. These results suggest that granulomatous vasculitis occurs without persistence of the viral genome and, perhaps, is a reaction to minute amounts of viral proteins. 
The endocrine effects of long-term treatment with mifepristone (RU 486). Mifepristone (RU 486) is a compound with progesterone as well as cortisol-blocking activities. We investigated the endocrine effects of long-term therapy of 10 patients with meningiomas with 200 mg mifepristone daily for 1 yr. Most patients initially complained of nausea, vomiting, and/or tiredness. In four patients prednisone (7.5 mg/day) had to be given simultaneously in order to overcome these side-effects. In retrospect those patients who presented with the most severe side-effects showed the most rapidly occurring activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis, as measured by an increase of circulating cortisol levels as well as of urinary cortisol excretion. Therapy with RU 486 activated the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in a resetting of this system at a higher level at which the diurnal rhythm and the responsiveness to CRH stimulation were maintained, whereas the sensitivity to dexamethasone had diminished. Secondarily the production of androstenedione and estradiol increased considerably. These endocrine changes were caused by the induction of partial cortisol receptor resistance during therapy with RU 486. The compensatory overproduction of androgens and consequently of estrogens during long-term RU 486 therapy might limit its use as a single treatment in the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancer. 
Acute pandysautonomic neuropathy. Acute pandysautonomic neuropathy is characterized by severe postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic dysfunction, with relative or complete sparing of motor and sensory function. Of four reported cases with sural nerve biopsies, two were normal and two abnormal, revealing loss of small myelinated and unmyelinated fibers. We present a patient with pandysautonomic neuropathy and elevated CSF protein whose sural nerve biopsy showed active axonal degeneration. 
A spectrum of bilateral squamous conjunctival tumors associated with human papillomavirus type 16. Three patients with bilateral tumors presenting as multiple keratinizing and verrucous lesions of the bulbar and tarsal conjunctiva were determined by DNA amplification and hybridization studies to harbor human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16). Results of biopsy in two patients showed infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma in one eye and dysplasia or carcinoma in situ in the fellow eye. In the third patient, focal, inflamed, hypertrophic, papillary lesions with pseudoglandular invaginations of the surface epithelium were found in the tarsal conjunctivae of both eyes. These are the first documented cases of bilateral conjunctival tumors associated with human papillomavirus. 
Exaggerated and prolonged thyrotrophin releasing hormone (TRH) test responses in tertiary hypothyroidism. A 60 year old man with panhypopituitarism due to a large meningioma and prolonged and exaggerated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) responses is described. Initial investigations showed a subnormal urinary free cortisol concentration, a low serum cortisol taken at 0900 hours, and a low free T4 concentration. The TSH was towards the upper end of the normal range. Subsequently pituitary function tests showed subnormal production of luteinising hormone in response to luteinising hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) and a short synacthen test with a low 30 minute cortisol value. Long synacthen testing showed a normal response at four days, confirming that the abnormalities were due to a pituitary or hypothalamic cause. A computed tomogram showed a large meningioma compressing the hypothalamus, pituitary, and temporal lobe. TRH testing showed a prolonged and exaggerated response, consistent with tertiary hypothyroidism. 
Treatment of antenatal myasthenia gravis. Maternal myasthenia gravis has been associated with the presence of neonatal myasthenia and sometimes fatal congenital anomalies. As a result, antenatal therapy directed at fetal sequelae may be indicated. We present the case of a pregnant myasthenic woman whose two previous pregnancies had ended in neonatal deaths from fetal deformations that were presumably due to maternal myasthenia. Serial plasmaphereses and oral prednisone therapy were used in an attempt to depress maternal anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titers. As anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody titers fell, fetal breathing movements became apparent by ultrasound, and as these titers rose, no fetal breathing movements were apparent. Our patient delivered an infant with transient neonatal myasthenia but normal pulmonary development and no deformations. We suggest that the therapy given may have improved the outcome of this pregnancy compared with her two previous pregnancies. 
Gastrointestinal mucosal injury in experimental models of shock, trauma, and sepsis. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The mucosa of the GI tract serves as an important barrier limiting the systemic absorption of luminal microbes and microbial products. Two methods commonly used to assess the integrity of the GI mucosal barrier are assessment of the extent of microbial translocation and measurement of mucosal permeability to hydrophilic probes. RESULTS: Studies using these methods have provided convincing evidence that the barrier function of the intestinal mucosa is deranged in numerous animal models of shock, trauma, and sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Although the mechanisms underlying mucosal injury under these circumstances remain incompletely understood, current evidence suggests that mucosal damage in shock, trauma, and sepsis is likely due to various combinations of intracellular hypoxia due to ischemia, tissue injury caused by reactive oxygen metabolites, the deleterious effects of various lipid mediators (e.g., platelet-activating factor) and/or cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor), and deficient utilization or supply of key nutritional substrates (e.g., glutamine). 
Pneumatic retinopexy. A two-year follow-up study of the multicenter clinical trial comparing pneumatic retinopexy with scleral buckling. The authors report 2-year follow-up information on 179 of 198 eyes (90%) enrolled in a previously published multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing pneumatic retinopexy (PR) with scleral buckling (SB) for the management of selected retinal detachments. Scleral buckling was compared with PR with regard to redetachment after the initial 6-month follow-up period (1% versus 1%), overall attachment (98% versus 99%), subsequent cataract surgery (18% versus 4%; P less than 0.05), preoperative visual acuity (no significant difference), and final visual acuity of 20/50 or better in eyes with macular detachment for a period of 14 days or less (67% versus 89%; P less than or equal to 0.05). Reoperations after a failed PR attempt did not adversely affect visual outcome. After 2 years, PR continues to compare favorably with SB. 
Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in surgical patients. Venous thromboembolic disease is a common, potentially life-threatening, but preventable complication of surgery. Venographic studies have shown a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis in patients who do not receive prophylaxis. The long-term sequelae of deep vein thrombosis in these patients can be disabling, but the exact prevalence of post-thrombotic complications has not been well documented. Fatal pulmonary embolism has been reported in 0.5% to 1% of patients after major abdominal surgery and in 2% to 6% after total hip replacement. Several methods of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism have demonstrated efficacy, but a surprising number of patients still do not receive prophylaxis. A medical record review in 16 hospitals recently disclosed that only 32% of high-risk patients received prophylaxis, with a range from 9% in a community hospital to 56% in a major teaching hospital. The possible reasons for this comparatively low rate of utilization are discussed. Current issues and future trends in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism are briefly summarized. 
Certified cause of death in children and young adults with cerebral palsy. The status of 732 children suffering from cerebral palsy from the South East Thames region (births from 1970-9) was ascertained at the end of 1989, and copies of death certificates of the 73 children who have died, aged 4 weeks to nearly 16 years, were obtained. Infantile cerebral palsy (ICD Code 343-) was coded as the underlying cause of death in only 16 (22%) cases. On 28 (38%) certificates there was no mention of any form of cerebral palsy, the proportion in which it was not mentioned increasing with age. In 20 (28%) cases the coded underlying cause of death was respiratory, hence in published national statistics the number of deaths from respiratory causes is inflated. A postmortem examination was known to have been performed in 23 cases, but the recorded information was in some cases limited to a 'terminal event'. The importance of good data on the death certificate, and the significance of published national statistics, need to be communicated to all those involved in the certification process if cerebral palsy and other chronic conditions, which raise the relative risk of death, are not to be under-represented. 
Repair of aortic coarctation in infants. Fifty-three consecutive infants younger than 2 years underwent coarctation repair. A recoarctation occurred in 11 infants (21%). To determine variables associated with recoarctation, we entered preoperative and operative data into a multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis. Patient weight was an incremental risk factor for recoarctation instead of age, in contrast to previously published studies. Furthermore, the residual gradient after the operation was a strong incremental risk factor. This risk factor was even more significant when expressed as a ratio of the systolic arm pressure, which takes background hemodynamics into account. Because weight is a more significant risk factor than age, we conclude that deferring operation is indicated only when the infant gains weight. Furthermore, a residual gradient is more important in the hemodynamic setting of a lower systolic arm pressure. 
Dose response characteristics of hypertonic saline dextran solutions. In an effort to find the best hypertonic saline-dextran solution (HSD) for prehospital use, 33 chronically catheterized sheep were bled using a fixed pressure shock model (50 mm Hg x 2 hours) and resuscitated with 4 ml/kg of HSD solution (2-minute bolus). In the first set of experiments colloid was varied and sodium chloride was held constant, as 7.5% NaCl was paired with either 0%, 6%, or 12% dextran 70. A dose-response relationship existed, with cardiac output increasing 20% with each sequential dextran 70 concentration. Mean arterial blood pressure was higher in animals that were resuscitated with either the 7.5% NaCl/6% dextran 70 or 7.5% NaCl/12% dextran 70 solution (p less than 0.05). Using the optimal dextran 70 concentration from the first set of experiments (i.e., 12%), solute was varied in a second set of experiments comparing 0.9%, 3.8%, 7.5%, or 10% NaCl/12% dextran 70. Again, dose-response features were demonstrated, as cardiac output increased as a function of NaCl concentration. However, this response plateaued with the 7.5% NaCl concentration and no advantage was obtained by increasing the NaCl concentration to 10%. We conclude that a 4-ml/kg bolus of 7.5% NaCl/12% dextran 70 solution may be a more effective form of therapy than those previously evaluated. This new solution is now being included in our ongoing clinical trials. 
Diminishment of respiratory sinus arrhythmia foreshadows doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. BACKGROUND. The development of a microcomputer-based device permits quick, simple, and noninvasive quantification of the respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) during quiet breathing. METHODS AND RESULTS. We prospectively and serially measured the radionuclide left ventricular ejection fraction and the RSA amplitude in 34 cancer patients receiving up to nine monthly bolus treatments with doxorubicin hydrochloride (60 mg/m2). Of the eight patients who ultimately developed symptomatic doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure, seven (87.5%) demonstrated a significant decline in RSA amplitude; five of 26 subjects without clinical symptoms of cardiotoxicity (19.2%) showed a similar RSA amplitude decline. On average, significant RSA amplitude decline occurred 3 months before the last planned doxorubicin dose in patients destined to develop clinical congestive heart failure. CONCLUSION. Overall, RSA amplitude abnormality proved to be a more specific predictor of clinically significant congestive heart failure than did serial resting radionuclide ejection fractions. 
Plasma endothelin in coronary venous blood from patients with either stable or unstable angina. STUDY OBJECTIVE--To test the hypothesis that the active coronary endothelial lesions in unstable angina raise the endothelin concentration in coronary venous blood. DESIGN--Systemic and coronary venous blood samples were obtained from unselected patients with the clinical syndromes of either stable or unstable angina at the time of cardiac catheterisation and coronary arteriography. Control venous blood samples were obtained from healthy laboratory workers and from patients with chronic renal failure treated by intermittent haemodialysis. PATIENTS--Twelve patients with angina: seven with stable symptoms and five with unstable angina. RESULTS--The mean coronary venous endothelin concentration in unstable angina was 2.32 ng/l (range 1.7-3.2 ng/l). In stable angina it was 2.77 ng/l (range 2.1-4.4 ng/l). These values were not significantly different from one another nor from the values obtained in systemic venous blood from either group or from the healthy controls. Circulating endothelin concentrations were much higher in venous blood from the patients treated by haemodialysis. CONCLUSIONS--These data do not support the hypothesis that raised endothelin concentrations in coronary blood in patients with unstable angina may modulate variations in coronary arterial tone thereby contributing to the clinical syndrome of chest pain and electrocardiographic changes at rest. The raised endothelin concentrations seen in systemic venous blood after myocardial infarction may be part of the systemic response to myocardial infarction. 
Effects of an increase in intracellular free [Mg2+] after myocardial stunning on sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ transport. BACKGROUND. Myocardial stunning has been associated with a greater than twofold increase in intracellular free [Mg2+] from 0.6 to 1.5 mM. The effect of this increase in free [Mg2+] on the function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ pump was assessed in SR isolated from Langendorff perfused, isovolumic rabbit hearts after 15 minutes of global ischemia. METHODS AND RESULTS. Our results indicate that myocardial stunning results in a shift in the Ca2+ sensitivity of oxalate-supported, Ca2+ transport over the entire range of free [Ca2+] associated with the cardiac cycle. Using 0.6 mM free Mg2+ as control, maximal rates of Ca2+ transport occurred at 1 microM free Ca2+ (control, 519 +/- 32; stunned, 337 +/- 37 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1). At 0.56 microM free Ca2+, SR Ca2+ transport was reduced from a control of 351 +/- 49 to 263 +/- 12 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1 at 0.6 mM free [Mg2+]. Moreover, an increase in the free [Mg2+] from 0.6 to 1.5 mM results in a greater shift in the Ca2+ activation curve with no change in the level of maximal activation. Ca2+ transport at 0.56 microM free Ca2+ was shifted in the stunned SR from 263 +/- 12 to 138 +/- 29 nmol Ca2+.min-1.mg-1 at 0.6 and 1.5 mM free Mg2+, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that an increase in free [Mg2+] after stunning in combination with the inherent defect in the SR Ca2+ ATPase may reduce the ability of the cell to regulate Ca2+ to a greater extent than previously observed. This impairment in Ca2+ regulatory function may contribute directly to the increase in diastolic tone and indirectly to the reduced systolic function characteristic of the stunned myocardium. 
Sarcomas of soft tissue and bone. Sarcomas arise primarily from mesenchymal structures at any site in the body, even within visceral stroma and neurovascular bundles. Sarcomas have been associated with prior radiation therapy, toxic exposures, and genetic conditions and soft tissue sarcomas have been distinguished from bone sarcomas. For localized soft tissue sarcoma, tumor grade is the most important prognostic variable. Low-grade tumors are generally cured by wide surgical excision, but there is a significant rate of both local recurrence and development of distant metastasis in high-grade lesions. The treatment of soft tissue sarcoma histologic subtypes is generally similar grade-for-grade, with the exception of rhabomyosarcoma, Kaposi's sarcoma, and mesothelioma. Tumor location strongly influences resectability. Radiation therapy has been used successfully in conjunction with conservative surgery to improve local control rates for soft tissue sarcomas, particularly in extremity lesions. Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy remains unproven for most adult soft tissue sarcomas, but is established in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and Ewing's sarcomas. 
Otolaryngologic aspects of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a systemic illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by the bite of a tick in the Ixodes ricinus complex. While the illness is often associated with a characteristic rash, erythema migrans, patients may also present with a variety of complaints in the absence of the rash. The otolaryngologist may be called upon to see both groups of patients, with any number of signs and symptoms referable to the head and neck, including headache, neck pain, odynophagia, cranial nerve palsy, head and neck dysesthesia, otalgia, tinnitus, hearing loss, vertigo, temporomandibular pain, lymphadenopathy, and dysgeusia. We review our institutional experience with 266 patients with Lyme disease, 75% of whom experienced head and neck symptoms. We also summarize the diagnostic and treatment modalities for this illness. 
Duplex Doppler sonography of the carotid artery: false-positive results in an artery contralateral to an artery with marked stenosis. Anecdotal reports have described a false-positive "jet effect" or velocity increase in the carotid artery contralateral to an artery with significant stenosis or occlusion when using duplex Doppler sonography. In this study, the frequency, significance, and possible reasons for this finding were evaluated by a retrospective comparison of duplex sonography and angiography. Twenty-three patients with unilateral 81-100% carotid artery stenosis who underwent both duplex sonography (16 Acuson, seven Quantum) and angiography were evaluated. In 14 patients, there was an accurate or slight underestimate (less than 20%) of stenosis present in the internal carotid artery contralateral to an artery with tight stenosis/occlusion. In nine, a velocity increase in the internal carotid artery resulted in overestimation (10-80%) of the actual degree of stenosis. In one of these nine patients, real-time images were sufficient to explain the velocity increase on the basis of vessel tortuosity. In one, falsely elevated velocity resulted from inaccurate assignment of the Doppler angle of incidence in a patient in whom real-time visualization of a distal internal carotid lesion was poor. In four of the nine patients, cross filling via the circle of Willis toward the side of greater stenosis occurred. However, seven of 14 patients in whom there was duplex sonography/angiography agreement or slight duplex sonography underestimation also had cross filling. Vertebral artery patency did not correlate well with the presence of a "jet effect." These findings suggest that an increase in blood flow velocity with duplex Doppler sonography in the internal carotid artery on the side opposite an artery with a tight stenosis is a common source of error and is not readily explained by angiographic evidence of collateral flow. 
Influence of isradipine on the maternal and fetal cardiovascular system in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. Nine pregnant women (aged 28.7 +/- 6.9 years) who had developed hypertension (blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg) took part in an open pilot study with the new calcium antagonist isradipine. Dosage was started with 1.25 mg twice daily and was increased weekly to 2.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily until a diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 80 mm Hg was achieved. By the time of the last visit before term, blood pressure was significantly reduced to 129/79 mm Hg and heart rate had not altered. External cardiotocography indicated fetal well-being throughout the entire study. Doppler flow measurements showed no deterioration in A:B ratio, resistance index, and pulsatile index. All measurements in the newborn were within normal ranges. In conclusion, isradipine is a safe and effective drug for pregnant women and their fetuses in the management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. 
Abdominal CT findings after liver transplantation in 66 patients. CT scanning is used frequently to assess the condition of patients after liver transplantation. The CT records of 174 adult patients who underwent liver transplantation were studied retrospectively to determine the number and timing of CT studies as well as the frequency and significance of the findings. One-hundred seventy CT scans were obtained in 66 (38%) of the 174 patients, with a mean of 2.6 scans/patient. The interval between transplantation and scanning was 1 day to 24 months; in 59 (89%) of 66 patients, the first CT scan was obtained within 30 days. The acute indications for CT scanning were fever or leukocytosis in 54 (92%) of 59 patients and abnormal liver function tests in five (8%) of 59 patients. CT scans obtained more than 30 days after transplantation were repeat scans in all but seven patients. Indications in this latter group were the same as for the acute group, plus evaluation of hepatic neoplasia in three patients. CT findings included periportal low attenuation in 41 (62%) of 66 patients; ascites in 25 (38%); splenomegaly in 19 (29%); loculated intraperitoneal noninfected fluid collections in 13 (20%); intrahepatic, splenic, pancreatic, or perihepatic abscesses in seven (11%); hepatic infarction in six (9%); splenic infarction in three (4%); and hepatic calcification in two (3%). Other major abnormalities included inferior vena caval thrombosis (one patient), pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery with rupture (one patient), and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (one patient). CT scanning after liver transplantation is used predominantly in the acute setting to evaluate for liver infarction or intraabdominal abscess. In this setting, CT showed these abnormalities, in addition to tumor recurrence or vascular abnormalities, in 15 (23%) of 66 patients. 
Protein-tyrosine-phosphatase CD45 is phosphorylated transiently on tyrosine upon activation of Jurkat T cells. The leukocyte common antigen (CD45) is an abundant lymphocyte surface antigen that has been reported to be involved in signaling through the T-cell antigen receptor. CD45 is a transmembrane protein-tyrosine-phosphatase. An internal segment comprises two domains each of which is homologous to other protein-tyrosine-phosphatases; the extracellular segment has the hallmarks of a ligand-binding motif. Since tyrosine phosphorylation is an early signal resulting from stimulation of the T-cell antigen receptor and CD45 is required for proper activation through the receptor, we explored whether CD45 might be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Treatment of a T-cell leukemia line (Jurkat) with either phytohemagglutinin or anti-CD3 antibodies induced phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD45; treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not. Phosphorylation of CD45 was transient, disappearing within 40 min after phytohemagglutinin treatment. The requirement for stringent conditions of phosphatase inhibition suggests that CD45 is capable of autodephosphorylation in vivo. These observations support recent reports indicating CD45 is involved in an early step in the T-cell activation cascade. They also suggest that phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of tyrosine residues in CD45 should be explored further as a possible regulatory mechanism. 
Headache in the use and withdrawal of opiates and other associated substances of abuse. The incidence and character of headache were retrospectively studied in 40 opiate addicts and 40 control subjects. The relationships between headache and use and withdrawal of opiates or other associated substances of abuse were investigated. In the opiate-dependent patients, the effects of opiate intake and withdrawal on headache were also investigated during detoxification treatment. A higher (p less than 0.001) incidence of headache was found in the opiate addicts (60%), particularly those with a longer history of addiction, than in the control subjects. A history of different types of headache (tension type headache, migraine-like headaches), which seemed respectively to be associated with the use of certain types of heroin, cocaine intake, and opiate withdrawal, was reported by the addicts who suffered from headache. Out of the 24 patients who completed the detoxification therapy, a migraine-like headache occurred in 37.5% of the subjects after opiate withdrawal. 
Treatment of ulcerated hemangiomas with the pulsed tunable dye laser. Hemangiomas are the most common tumor of infancy and are characterized by rapid growth during the first 6 months of life. During the rapid growth phase, approximately 5% to 10% of the hemangiomas ulcerate. Ulcerated lesions are painful, may bleed, and are at risk for bacterial infection. Previous therapy has included daily local wound care, topical antibiotics, and local and systemic steroids. We treated nine infants (eight female and one male) with ulcerated hemangiomas by means of a vascular-specific (585-nm) pulsed (450-microsecond) tunable dye laser. Eight of the nine patients had a single ulceration, whereas one patient had two ulcerations within a large hemangioma. Six of the ulcerations healed with a single laser treatment. One ulceration required two treatments to heal, and the remaining two required three treatments. Pain was subjectively decreased within 2 to 3 days in all patients after a single treatment. The pulsed tunable dye laser should be considered in the treatment of all ulcerated hemangiomas. 
Pathophysiology of myocardial perfusion in hypertension. Chronic and acute hypertension have multiple untoward effects on the coronary circulation, several of which may either mimic or markedly worsen the clinical manifestations of coronary artery disease. Early after the onset of left ventricular hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, coronary vasodilator reserve is significantly impaired. During cardiac hypertrophy secondary to hypertension, the coronary arteries fail to enlarge in concert with ventricular enlargement. This failure results in a relative decrease by approximately 50% in the ratio of epicardial vessel diameter to the mass of myocardium perfused. The lower range of coronary subendocardial autoregulation is altered by chronic renovascular hypertension. A variety of vascular smooth muscle homeostatic mechanisms are abnormal in genetic models of hypertension, as is endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation. Acute hypertension may enhance constriction to serotonin, most likely through the release of potent vasoconstrictor substances from leukocytes and platelets that adhere to the endothelium as a result of endothelial damage. Finally, many of the consequences of myocardial infarction are worsened in the setting of hypertension and left ventricular hypertrophy. 
Kistrin, a polypeptide platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, enhances and sustains coronary arterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in a canine preparation BACKGROUND. Kistrin is a 68-amino acid polypeptide from the venom of the Malayan pit viper Agkistrodon rhodostoma, which inhibits the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor. Its effect on thrombolysis, reocclusion, and bleeding associated with administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was studied in a canine model of coronary artery thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Coronary patency was monitored for 2 hours by ultrasonic flow probe and repeated coronary angiography. The rt-PA was given as 0.45-mg/kg bolus injections at 15-minute intervals until recanalization or to a maximum of four boluses. Four groups of four or five dogs were studied: a control group that received intravenous heparin (4,000-unit bolus and 1,000 units each hour) and three groups that received heparin and 0.48, 0.24, or 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, administered as a 10% bolus injection and an infusion during a 60-minute period. In the control group, reflow occurred in four of five dogs within 37 +/- 47 minutes but was followed by cyclic reflow and reocclusion. Kistrin at a dose of 0.48 and 0.24 mg/kg reduced the time to reflow to 6 +/- 5 and 10 +/- 3 minutes, respectively, and abolished reocclusion. With 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, reflow occurred in all four animals, within 27 +/- 23 minutes, and reocclusion occurred in two animals. Kistrin induced a dose-related prolongation of the template bleeding time: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, the bleeding time was prolonged from 3.8 +/- 1.3 minutes before infusion to 29 +/- 2 minutes during infusion, but it was shortened to 8.3 +/- 2.6 minutes at 90 minutes after the end of infusion. Kistrin also caused a dose-related inhibition of platelet aggregation with ADP and collagen: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, platelet aggregation was abolished during the infusion but had partially recovered toward the end of the observation period. Pathological examination of recanalized coronary arterial segments of dogs given 0.48 or 0.24 mg/kg kistrin revealed widely patent arteries with some platelets layered on the damaged intimal surface. CONCLUSIONS. Kistrin increases the rate and extent of thrombolysis with a reduced dose of rt-PA, and it prevents reocclusion. At an effective dose, it is associated with a transient prolongation of the bleeding time and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Kistrin may offer promise as adjunctive treatment to thrombolytic agents in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
Massive hemorrhage from a ruptured enteric varices of an augmented bladder. Intestinal varices are uncommon and usually occur secondary to portal hypertension. We report a case of variceal rupture in the intestinal segment of an augmentation colocystoplasty. The patient presented in shock from exsanguinating hemorrhage per urethram, and diagnosis was established at laparotomy. Although the bleeding was controlled with excision of the involved intestinal segment, the patient died of multiple organ failure. The diagnosis and treatment of this rare but fatal condition are discussed. 
Intracerebral temperature in neurosurgical patients. Recent laboratory results have indicated that the ischemic brain is very sensitive to minor variations in temperature. This has created new interest in hypothermia and brain temperature. There is, however, very little information available regarding human intracerebral temperature and its relation to body core temperature during normal and pathological circumstances. We therefore made continuous measurements of the temperature of the lateral ventricle in 15 neurosurgical patients utilizing a newly developed technique with copper-constantan thermocouples introduced through a plastic catheter also used for monitoring intracranial pressure. The intraventricular temperature was higher than the rectal temperature during approximately 90% of all measurements. The largest temperature gradient measured was 2.3 degrees C. Usually the difference between the temperature of the rectum and the brain was much smaller, the mean value being 0.33 degrees C. For the patients in the most severe condition, the rectal temperature was sufficiently close to the brain temperature to afford a reliable basis for adequate clinical judgment. 
Complications of the Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion: case report of late development of malignancy. We report on 3 patients with bladder exstrophy followed for more than 15 years after having undergone Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion. One patient had adenocarcinoma at the ureterocolonic anastomoses 16 years after diversion. To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a malignancy developing after a Heitz-Boyer procedure. The other 2 patients had significant problems with urinary incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections. Initial success with this form of urinary diversion can be followed by significant long-term complications. 
Clear cell squamous cell carcinoma. A histologic, immunohistologic, and ultrastructural study. Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) usually show a standard histopathologic picture only varying with regard to their degree of differentiation. The authors describe a case of clear cell SCC that was studied by light and electron microscopy. The clear cells showed an empty cytoplasm that was periodic acid-Schiff and alcian blue negative. By electron microscopy these cytoplasms consisted of empty spaces and were not surrounded by membranes, which would be consistent with lipid vacuoles. The differential diagnosis of this uncommon variant of SCC requires consideration of other clear cell tumors. 
Phrenic neural output during hypoxia in dogs: constant-flow ventilation vs. spontaneous breathing. We studied the effects of removing cyclic pulmonary afferent neural information on respiratory pattern generation in anesthetized dogs. Phrenic neural output during spontaneous breathing (SB) was compared with that occurring during constant-flow ventilation (CFV) at several levels of eucapnic hypoxemia. Hypoxia caused an increase in both the frequency and the amplitude of the moving time average (MTA) phrenic neurogram during both SB and CFV. The change in frequency as arterial saturation was reduced from 90 to 60% during SB was significantly higher than that during CFV [SB, 32.3 +/- 10.9 (SD) breaths/min; CFV, 10.3 +/- 5.8 breaths/min; P = 0.001]. By contrast, the increase in the amplitude of the MTA phrenic neurogram was smaller (SB, 0.62 +/- 0.68 units; CFV, 1.35 +/- 0.81 units; P = 0.01). The changes in frequency with hypoxia during both modes of ventilation resulted primarily from a shortening of expiratory time. Both inspiratory time and expiratory time were greater during CFV than during SB, but their change in response to hypoxia was not significantly different. We conclude that the amplitude response of the MTA phrenic neurogram to hypoxia is similar to that seen during hypercapnia; in the presence of phasic afferent feedback the MTA amplitude response is decreased and the frequency response is increased relative to the response observed in the absence of phasic afferents. 
Captopril improves neurologic outcome from incomplete cerebral ischemia in rats. We investigated the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on neurologic outcome in a rat model of incomplete cerebral ischemia. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and fentanyl (10 micrograms x kg-1 i.v. bolus, 25 micrograms x kg-1 x hr-1 i.v. continuous infusion). Animals in group 1 (n = 10) received no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor while animals in group 2 (n = 10) were given 10 mg x kg-1 i.v. captopril 30 minutes prior to the ischemic period. Ischemia was produced by unilateral carotid artery ligation and hemorrhagic hypotension to 35 mm Hg for 30 minutes. Body temperature, arterial blood gases, and arterial pH were maintained constant. Neurologic outcome was evaluated every 24 hours for 3 days using a graded deficit score (0, normal; 18, stroke-related death). On the third day after ischemia, captopril significantly improved neurologic outcome (median deficit score = 4) compared with controls (median deficit score = 18) (p less than 0.05). These results suggest that reduced angiotensin II levels or increased tissue kinin concentrations may decrease ischemic brain injury. 
Ability of high-intensity ultrasound to ablate human atherosclerotic plaques and minimize debris size. To investigate whether high-intensity ultrasound can destroy atherosclerotic plaques while sparing the normal arterial wall, 279 normal human aortic sites and 119 fibrous and 193 calcified plaques, obtained from 24 necropsies, were insonified in a water tank, at 20 kHz and at 5 different power intensities, ranging from 68 W/cm2 (P1) to 150 W/cm2 (P5). These intensities were associated with a total excursion of the ultrasound irradiation apparatus tip from 90 to 268 microns, respectively. Time to perforate normal aortic sites and fibrous and calcified plaques was recorded at each intensity. There was no difference in perforation time between normal aortic sites and fibrous and calcified plaques when high-power levels (P2 to P5) were used. However, at the lowest power (P1), perforation time for the normal aortic wall was significantly longer than for fibrous and calcified plaques: 30 +/- 18 seconds (166 observations), 14 +/- 7 seconds (p less than 0.001) (78 observations) and 12 +/- 8 seconds (p less than 0.001) (115 observations), respectively. When perforation times for normal vessel wall versus fibrous plaque and normal vessel wall versus calcified plaque from the same necropsy specimen were compared in a pairwise manner, the results were: 29 +/- 13 vs 16 +/- 7 (p less than 0.001) (48 paired observations) and 26 +/- 9 vs 10 +/- 5 seconds (p less than 0.001) (55 paired observations), respectively. Regardless of whether paired or unpaired comparison was applied, no significant difference was found in perforation time between fibrous and calcified plaques. The debris did not differ in size as measured separately for normal sites and fibrous and calcified plaques by a computer-interfaced Channelizer and Coulter Counter system. 
The effect of radiation therapy on the fixation strength of an experimental porous-coated implant in dogs. Radiation therapy prevents heterotopic ossification after cemented total hip arthroplasty, but its effect on the fixation of porous-coated devices is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of irradiation on the pullout strength of a porous implant in the canine model. A custom-designed titanium fiber metal-coated cylinder was implanted into the distal femurs of 12 dogs. One femur of each dog was irradiated with 10 Gy, given in four 2.5-Gy daily fractions beginning one day after surgery. Serial bone scans were performed at one, two, four, and six weeks postoperatively. At six weeks, the femurs were harvested, and eight were randomly selected for mechanical testing. Scintigraphic evaluation showed a significant reduction in uptake at one and two weeks in the irradiated limb, but this had returned to normal at four and six weeks. The failure to pullout was significantly less in the irradiated limb compared with the control limb six weeks postoperatively. In this canine model, the pullout strength of the titanium fiber implant was significantly reduced by a dose of radiation commonly used in the prevention of heterotopic ossification. If irradiation is chosen for prophylaxis, either the porous implant should be adequately shielded or a cemented implant should be utilized. 
Disability, residential mobility, and changes in living arrangements. The extent of mobility and changes in living arrangements associated with disability were studied using data from the 1984-86 Longitudinal Study of Aging. It was hypothesized that persons with significant limitations in their ability to perform normal daily activities (ADLs and IADLs) in 1984 would be more likely to move, more likely to be living with others in 1986, and more likely to have entered an institution between 1984 and 1986 than those without limitations. When only those variables that were measured in 1984 were used as predictors, this turned out to be true for institutionalization and for living with others in 1986. However, among those remaining in households, residential mobility showed little relationship to disability when other variables were controlled. When the change in disability between 1984 and 1986 was added to the prediction equation, there were strong relationships between changes in disability and both residential mobility and adjustment in living arrangement, suggesting that people respond quickly to significant changes in disability. However, because we cannot be sure that the changes in disability preceded the mobility or changes in living arrangements, we cannot claim to have established a causal link between these events. 
Change in the expression of a nuclear matrix-associated protein is correlated with cellular transformation. We have identified a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a nuclear matrix-associated protein in NIH 3T3 cells. The immunofluorescence pattern consists predominantly of bright nuclear granule clusters distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, with the exclusion of nucleoli. It recognizes a protein of 190 kDa that is down-regulated to various degrees in a panel of single-oncogene-transformed NIH 3T3 cells. Its localization is similar, but not identical, to the spliceosomal speckles. p190 shows a coordinate expression during the growth cycle of nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells; it is synthesized at the highest level under growth arrest conditions. It is expressed in adult mouse brain and is also present in human IMR-90 fibroblasts. 
Small, deep pelvic abscesses: definition and drainage guided with an endovaginal probe. Four small, deep pelvic abscesses were easily drained transvaginally by using an endovaginal transducer for guidance, support, and continuous monitoring of catheter placement. Collections that could not be drained percutaneously or at surgery were effectively managed with this technique. An inexpensive guide (estimated cost, $1.65) facilitated control of the catheter. All four abscesses resolved without further intervention. 
Exercise thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy in the assessment of coronary artery disease. Exercise thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy has been used extensively over the last decade for the detection and localization of coronary artery disease. Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is a refinement of presently available techniques, offering improved identification over planar imaging of individual vessel stenosis and quantification of the extent of abnormally perfused myocardium. In this review, the planar and SPECT techniques are discussed in light of the most recently published large patient series, and with regard to the many factors that affect the sensitivity and specificity of perfusion imaging in identifying coronary artery disease. The clinical implications of exercise perfusion scintigraphy and its future applications in cardiology practice are discussed. 
Obstructive sleep apnea complicating negative-pressure ventilatory support in patients with chronic paralytic/restrictive ventilatory dysfunction. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence and severity of obstructive events and oxyhemoglobin desaturation (dSaO2) in 37 patients with paralytic/restrictive ventilatory insufficiency during use of nocturnal ventilatory assistance provided by means of negative-pressure body ventilators (BVs). Thirteen of the 37 patients had mean oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) less than 95 percent and a mean of ten or more episodes per hour when the dSaO2 was greater than or equal to 4 percent (4%dSaO2/h). In all, 26 of the 37 patients had evidence of significant multiple episodes of dSaO2 while asleep on BVs. Polysomnography performed on three of these patients substantiated the obstructive nature of the dSaO2. Twenty-two of the 37 patients who had a mean SaO2 of 90.6 +/- 7.2 percent and a mean of 17.7 +/- 16.1 4%dSaO2/h on BVs were switched to noninvasive ventilatory assistance by intermittent positive airway pressure (NV-PAP). Their mean SaO2 improved to 96.0 +/- 2.2 percent, and the 4%dSaO2/h decreased to 1.2 +/- 1.8 per hour. All symptoms similar to those of obstructive sleep apnea were relieved. We conclude that BV use is associated with significant dSaO2 in over 50 percent of patients. The dSaO2 is predominantly obstructive in nature but may be due to chronic underventilation in patients using less effective BVs. Patients with a mean SaO2 less than 95 percent or 10 or more 4%dSaO2/h may benefit from conversion to NV-PAP via the nose, the mouth, or an oral-nasal interface. 
Intrahepatic hematoma: a rare complication of exchange transfusion. A four-day-old male neonate who underwent three exchange transfusions for jaundice owing to ABO incompatibility on three consecutive days is presented. A large intrahepatic hematoma developed as a complication of the third exchange transfusion. The baby fully recovered. 
Partial motor epilepsy with "negative myoclonus". Three children had both nocturnal unilateral motor seizures and daytime ipsilateral "negative myoclonus" which occurred so frequently that it resembled asterixis. Neurophysiologic studies demonstrated lateralized spike discharges that were time-locked to postural lapse in the contralateral outstretched arm. The clinical course was characterized by good seizure control with benzodiazepines. 
Treatment of acute migraine with subcutaneous sumatriptan. Sumatriptan succinate, a 5-HT1D receptor agonist, constricts human cranial arteries. Two parallel-group trials for treatment of acute migraines were conducted in the United States. Adult patients were randomized and given either 6 mg of sumatriptan succinate subcutaneously (n = 734) or placebo (n = 370). At 1 hour, sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing moderate or severe headache pain to mild or no pain (70% vs 22%), in completely relieving headaches (49% vs 9%), and in improving clinical disability (76% vs 34%). Sumatriptan also reduced nausea and photophobia significantly better than placebo. Patients with residual migraines received another injection; those who had originally received sumatriptan received either a second active injection (n = 187) or placebo (n = 178), while those who had received placebo received a second placebo injection (n = 335). Statistical evidence for benefit of second sumatriptan injection is absent. Adverse events associated with sumatriptan were tingling, dizziness, warm-hot sensations, and injection-site reactions. Sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated in patients with acute migraine. 
Deletion of sequences upstream of the proteinase improves the proteolytic processing of human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expresses structural proteins and replicative enzymes within gag and gag-pol precursor polyproteins. Specific proteolytic processing of the precursors by the viral proteinase is essential for maturation of infectious viral particles. We have studied the activity of proteinase in its immature form, as part of a gag-pol fusion protein, in an in vitro expression system. We found that deletion of p6*, the region in pol upstream of proteinase, resulted in improved processing of the precursor. A modified proteinase is released, but it functions less efficiently than wild type. Improved autoprocessing correlates with increased accessibility of the active site region in the polyprotein carrying the p6* deletion. Our results suggest that p6* is involved in the regulation of proteinase activation, perhaps as a region limiting the interaction of the active site and substrate binding domain with the remainder of the polyprotein. Release of p6* inhibition may be an activation step necessary for infectious particle maturation. 
Dipyridamole echocardiography stress testing in hypertensive patients. Targets and tools. Arterial hypertension can provoke a reduction in coronary flow reserve through several mechanisms that are not mutually exclusive, namely, coronary artery disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microvascular disease. These different targets of arterial hypertension should be explored with different diagnostic markers. The transient dyssynergy detected by two-dimensional echocardiography and evoked during dipyridamole infusion is a marker of coronary disease that is equally reliable in normotensive and hypertensive individuals. On the contrary, dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression is frequently elicited in hypertensive patients when angiographically assessed coronary disease is absent. This ischemiclike electrocardiographic response can be found in echocardiographically assessed left ventricular hypertrophy. However, even when left ventricular mass is normal, dipyridamole-induced ST segment depression is associated with an impaired coronary flow response to pacing, which is consistent with microvascular disease. Whether echocardiographically silent electrocardiographic changes are simply diagnostic noises transmitting a misleading false positive response or a potentially important clinical marker of early myocardial damage remains a pivotal though still unanswered question. 
Response characteristics of a dual transcutaneous oxygen/carbon dioxide monitoring system. We tested the response characteristics of a dual transcutaneous (tc) PO2/PCO2 monitoring system in healthy subjects who breathed various gas mixtures, and we compared steady-state tc readings to simultaneous arterial blood gas analysis in 20 stable respiratory outpatients. The electrodes were simple to apply, required very little skin preparation, and had trivial signal drift. In healthy subjects, tcPCO2 lag time during CO2 rebreathing was 16.8 seconds, with a 90 percent response time of 77.9 seconds after CO2 breathing was discontinued. The 90 percent response times of the O2 electrode when subjects breathed a hypoxic mixture was 257 seconds after a lag of 31 seconds. When inhaled gas mixtures were changed from hypoxia to room air, the lag time was shorter (12.5 seconds), but 90 percent response time exceeded 5 minutes. In stable patients with respiratory disease, tcPCO2 and tcPO2 were linearly related to PaCO2 (range, 19 to 53 mm Hg) and PaO2 (range, 45 to 99 mm Hg), respectively (tcPCO2 = 1.4 PaCO2-9.44, with r = 0.90 and SEE = 5.35 mm Hg; tcPO2 = 0.56 PaO2 + 20.4, with r = 0.53 and SEE = 11.7 mm Hg). We conclude that the response of the dual transcutaneous monitoring system is more rapid for the CO2 than the O2 electrode and may be rapid enough to be useful in some clinical settings; however, the O2 system fails to offer the response characteristics and accuracy that would allow it to be substituted for arterial gas tensions in unstable clinical situations. 
Risk factors for stroke as predictors of platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease. We have previously reported that increased platelet membrane fluidity identifies a subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who have distinct clinical features including an earlier age of symptomatic onset, a more rapidly progressive cognitive decline, and a decreased prevalence of focal electroencephalographic findings. In the current study, these patients also exhibited a decreased prevalence of risk factors for stroke compared with patients who had normal platelet membrane fluidity. Our findings suggest that the platelet membrane abnormality describes a clinical subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who are less likely to have coexisting cerebrovascular disease than the remaining patients who meet clinical consensus criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease. 
Enhancement of mammary carcinogenesis by high levels of dietary fat: a phenomenon dependent on ad libitum feeding Female 55-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single intravenous dose of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), 2 mg/100 g of body weight each. At 60 days of age, the rats were divided into four dietary groups (41-42 rats/group):I, 5% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; II, 20% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; III, 5% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group I; and IV, 20% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group II. The 5% and 20% corn oil diets were purified semisynthetic diets that were isonutrient on a caloric basis. All animals were housed individually in single cages; food consumption of each animal was computed daily throughout the study. Sixteen weeks after carcinogen treatment, mean numbers of mammary carcinomas per rat (+/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 4.1 +/- 0.6, 6.8 +/- 0.7, 3.0 +/- 0.3, and 4.1 +/- 0.5, respectively. Mean weight of mammary carcinomas per rat (g +/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 3.5 +/- 0.7, 8.0 +/- 1.3, 3.0 +/- 1.1, and 4.6 +/- 1.3, respectively. Mammary carcinoma number and weight were significantly (P less than .01) increased in the animals fed the 20% corn oil diet ad libitum when compared with those fed the 5% corn oil diet ad libitum; however, no significant differences in mammary tumor number or weight were observed between the animals fed a restricted, 20% corn oil diet and those fed a restricted, 5% corn oil diet. The study involving the animals fed the 12%-restricted diets was repeated (38-42 rats/group), with virtually identical results, i.e., the mean number of mammary carcinomas per rat in the groups fed the restricted 5% fat and 20% fat diets at termination of the study was 3.1 +/- 0.4 and 3.7 +/- 0.3, respectively, and the mean weight (g) of mammary carcinomas per rat was 4.3 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 +/- 1.1, respectively (no significant differences). Thus, high levels of dietary fat can significantly enhance mammary carcinogenesis in female rats, but only in animals on an ad libitum feeding protocol. A slight restriction in amount consumed (12% less than ad libitum) abolished the mammary carcinogenic differential between a high-fat and a low-fat diet. 
Recombinant interferon alfa given before and in combination with standard chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first marrow relapse: a Pediatric Oncology Group pilot study. Recombinant interferon alfa (rIFN-alpha) was given to 31 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first on-therapy marrow relapse as the sole treatment (30 megaunits/m2/d intravenously x 10 days) before standard four-drug reinduction and during multiagent continuation therapy (30 megaunits/m2 subcutaneously x 3 consecutive days every 3 weeks). After 10 days of rIFN-alpha, there were two partial remissions (PRs); seven additional patients had either greater than or equal to 25% reduction in the percentage of marrow blast cells or hypoplastic marrow. Two patients had progressive disease with an increase in leukocyte counts. All patients experienced influenza-like symptoms, and there were isolated instances of severe abdominal pain and personality change. Dose-limiting toxicity comprised grade III/IV transaminase elevation (two patients) and syncope with personality change (one patient). Twenty-three of 31 children (74%) subsequently achieved marrow remission using standard agents. One patient was taken off study during teniposide (VM-26) and cytarabine (ara-C) consolidation due to toxicity. Continuation therapy including rIFN-alpha pulse was well tolerated in the remaining children; only one patient required rIFN-alpha dosage reduction (for CNS toxicity). rIFN-alpha toxicity did not necessitate reductions in doses of standard chemotherapy agents or significant delays in therapy. Five patients remain in remission at 26+ to 36+ months; 13 patients relapsed in marrow, one in the meninges (7 months), and one in meninges, mediastinum, and lymph nodes (2 months). Two children were removed from study for marrow transplant. In summary, high-dose rIFN-alpha alone had a modest antileukemic effect. In contrast to the clinical experience with combined rIFN-alpha and chemotherapy in adults, rIFN-alpha given in a pulse-like manner throughout continuation therapy did not compromise the intensity of the standard chemotherapy regimen. 
Enhanced gastric mucosal haemostasis after upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. An endoscopic technique for the measurement of gastric mucosal bleeding time has been developed to study gastric haemostasis in patients with acute upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage. The relation of gastric mucosal bleeding time to skin bleeding time and nonsterodial anti-inflammatory drug usage was examined in 61 control patients and in 47 patients presenting with bleeding peptic ulcers or erosions. Gastric mucosal bleeding time was shorter in patients with haemorrhage (median 2 minutes, range 0-5 minutes) than in the control group (median 4 minutes, range 2-8 minutes) (p less than 0.001). Skin bleeding times were similar in the two groups (medians 4 minutes in patients with haemorrhage and 4.5 minutes in controls). In 21 patients with haemorrhage who were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the median gastric mucosal bleeding time (2.5 minutes, range 1.0-5.0 minutes) was similar to that in 26 patients with haemorrhage not associated with these drugs (2.0 minutes, range 0.0-5.0 minutes). These results show that gastric mucosal haemostasis is accelerated in response to haemorrhage in the upper gastrointestinal tract, even in patients taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. This enhanced gastric haemostasis probably reflects a local protective response to minimise blood loss from the bleeding lesion. 
Prognostic value of serum proteins synthesized by breast carcinoma cells. Several breast carcinoma cell lines or explants of such tumors, as well as examples of lactating or dysplastic breast tissue, synthesized three serum proteins (alpha 2-Zn-glycoprotein, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, and alpha-lipoprotein) in vitro. These proteins were detected by immunoperoxidase techniques in 126 breast carcinomas that had been evaluated clinically for more than six years. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein was present in 58% of the carcinomas, whereas alpha 1-antichymotrypsin was seen in 55% and alpha-lipoprotein in 52%. These markers showed a relationship with clinical outcome. Alpha-1-antichymotrypsin and alpha-lipoprotein were unfavorable determinants, whereas alpha 2-Zn-glycoprotein was detected in lesions with a favorable evolution. Taken individually, these markers have similar but rather weak associations with five-year survival rates; roughly 20% of patients in the "favorable" group died, compared with 33% in the "unfavorable" group. Alpha-2-Zn-glycoprotein in grade 1 tumors was a marker with marginally favorable significance, but alpha 1-antichymotrypsin significantly worsened the prognosis of grade 2 and 3 tumors. Furthermore, stratification of patients according to the number of positive unfavorable markers yielded striking results. Eight percent of patients with none of the unfavorable markers were dead at five years, compared with 55% of those whose lesions expressed three unfavorable markers. 
Total replacement for post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow. Fifty-three of 55 consecutive elbow replacements for post-traumatic arthritis were followed for a minimum of two years (mean 6.3, range 2 to 14.4). The patients presented difficult management problems, having undergone an average of two previous operations per joint; 22 joints had suffered prior complications; 18 had less than 50 degrees of flexion and six were flail. One of three versions of the Coonrad prosthesis was employed in all. During the follow-up period, 10 patients underwent 14 revision procedures for aseptic loosening; 38 elbows are currently without progressive radiolucent lines. In two patients an elbow had to be resected, one for deep infection and the other for bone resorption following a foreign-body reaction to titanium. The current design of the Coonrad prosthesis offers a reliable option for the treatment of post-traumatic arthritis but should be used only in carefully selected patients over the age of 60 years. 
Cardiac rehabilitation services: what are they and are they worth it? The objectives of cardiac rehabilitation include lowering mortality but, more importantly, increasing functional capacity so reducing disability and potentially improving quality of life. The data suggest that cardiac rehabilitation services are worth the patient's costs and efforts and as such, they should be considered an integral component of comprehensive cardiovascular care by cardiologists and primary care physicians. While there is considerable agreement on the roles of exercise testing and training in the three position stands, there are also substantiated, and important, differences in their recommendations on other cardiac rehabilitation services, such as counseling and risk factor management. The challenge for the 1990's is not only to continue to better define the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation services, but more urgently, how to deliver effective services most efficiently. This will help physicians provide optimum care for their patients, will improve the patient's likelihood of regaining for themselves an active and productive life, and should generate a more equitable and accountable reimbursement system for quality health care. 
Risk stratification for arrhythmic events in postinfarction patients based on heart rate variability, ambulatory electrocardiographic variables and the signal-averaged electrocardiogram. The value of heart rate variability, ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) variables and the signal-averaged ECG in the prediction of arrhythmic events (sudden death or life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias) was assessed before hospital discharge in 416 consecutive survivors of acute myocardial infarction. During the follow-up period (range 1 to 1,112 days), there were 24 arrhythmic events and 47 deaths. The initial relation between several prognostic factors and arrhythmic events was explored with use of the Kaplan-Meier product limit estimates of survival function. Impaired heart rate variability less than 20 ms (p less than 0.0000), late potentials (p less than 0.0000), ventricular ectopic beat frequency (p less than 0.0000), repetitive ventricular forms (p less than 0.0000), left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40% (p less than 0.02) and Killip class (p less than 0.02) were identified as significant univariate predictors of arrhythmic events. When these variables were analyzed by using a stepwise Cox regression model, only impaired heart rate variability, followed by late potentials and repetitive ventricular forms remained independent predictors of arrhythmic events. The combination of impaired heart rate variability and late potentials had a sensitivity of 58%, a positive predictive accuracy of 33% and a relative risk of 18.5 for arrhythmic events and was superior to other combinations including those incorporating left ventricular function, exercise ECG, ventricular ectopic beat frequency and repetitive ventricular forms. These results suggest that a simple method of assessment based on heart rate variability and the signal-averaged ECG can select a small subgroup of survivors of myocardial infarction at high risk of future life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden death. 
Hemianesthesia, sensory neglect, and defective access to conscious experience. We report a patient with an ischemic stroke in the vascular territory of the right middle cerebral artery who had left spatial neglect and left hemianesthesia. The patient showed a dissociation between defective verbal reporting of somatosensory stimuli delivered to the left hand and physiologic evidence from an autonomic index. This indicates that there was processing of undetected stimuli without the patient's awareness, and suggests that the hemianesthesia was due, at least in part, to somesthetic hemi-inattention. 
Pathogenesis of thrombosis in unstable angina. Plaque rupture of the thinned, weak fibrous cap infiltrated by macrophages and overlying a pool of lipid in the arterial wall initiates the acute thrombotic event of unstable angina. Thrombosis may be advanced within minutes. Most lesions that precede plaque rupture are minor (less than 50% stenosis); thus, thrombus greatly contributes to sudden flow limitation and onset of symptoms. If thrombosis can be totally blocked (not possible with current antithrombotic agents), clinical events should be preventable, and endogenous thrombolysis may be possible within days. Local and systemic factors contribute to arterial thrombosis. With type III injury (fissure into plaque or media) platelet-rich thrombus anchors in the fissure, tracks along the site of deep injury, extends into the lumen, and requires the highest blood level of specific thrombin inhibition (a molar concentration that inhibits the total concentration of prothrombin in circulating blood). Thus, the thrombin content requiring inhibition in type III injury is highest. Local factors for thrombosis associated with type III injury include the rheology of blood flow (increased shear rate forces platelets to the periphery) and substrates in the arterial wall. Plaque substrates include the more thrombogenic collagens (types I and III and diabetic or glycosylated collagen), tissue thromboplastin, lipid gruel, thrombin bound to arterial wall matrix, and decreased prostacyclin. There is a direct relation between platelet deposition (thrombus) and local vasoconstriction, which may perpetuate each other. Thrombus as a substrate is more thrombogenic than type III arterial injury. 
Ossified mucin-secreting choroid plexus adenoma: case report. This is the first report of a fully documented case of an ossified mucin-producing benign choroid plexus tumor. This was a chance finding in a man who complained only of posttraumatic low back discomfort. The ossification of the tumor appears to have been therapeutic. Mucin production may be a defense mechanism. 
Increased incidence of lymphoproliferative disorder after immunosuppression with the monoclonal antibody OKT3 in cardiac-transplant recipients BACKGROUND. A sudden increase in the incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder among the patients in our cardiac-transplantation program was temporally related to introduction of the immunosuppressive drug OKT3. This monoclonal antibody has come to be widely used in recent years both to prevent and to treat rejection after cardiac transplantation. METHODS. In order to identify variables that predict the development of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, we analyzed retrospectively a series of 154 consecutive cardiac-transplant recipients at a single institution. Univariate analyses and multivariate analysis by logistic regression were performed. RESULTS. Among 75 patients who did not receive OKT3, post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder developed in 1 (1.3 percent), as compared with 9 of 79 patients who received the drug (11.4 percent); the incidence among the OKT3-treated patients was ninefold higher (odds ratio, 9.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 54.7). According to multivariate analysis, the only factor significantly associated with the development of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder was the use of OKT3 (P = 0.001). A significant increase in risk with increasing doses was also apparent: 4 of 65 patients who received a cumulative dose of 75 mg of OKT3 or less (6.2 percent) had post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, whereas 5 of 14 patients who received more than 75 mg had the disorder (35.7 percent; P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION. The addition of OKT3 to the immunosuppressive regimen increases the incidence of post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder after cardiac transplantation, and the risk increases sharply after cumulative doses greater than 75 mg. We suggest that the risks and benefits of prophylactic OKT3 administration be reassessed in the light of these findings, particularly since the value of prophylactic immunotherapy in cardiac-transplant recipients remains to be clearly established. 
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and complicated diverticular disease: a case-control study. Fifty patients with severe complications of diverticular disease were compared with two groups of 50 controls, matched for age and sex. The first control group (A) was randomly selected from all emergency hospital admissions, and the second group (B) from patients with uncomplicated diverticular disease. Of the 50 study patients, 24 (48 per cent) were taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at the time of admission compared with nine (18 per cent) of control group A and ten (20 per cent) of control group B. Both of these differences were statistically significant, indicating a strong association between the ingestion of NSAIDs and the development of severe complications of diverticular disease. 
Is there a link between fluoridated water and osteosarcoma? To test the hypothesis that fluoride is a risk factor for osteosarcoma, a case control study compared the complete residential fluoride histories of osteosarcoma patients with matched hospital-based controls. Fluoridation was not found to be a risk factor for osteosarcoma in the study population. The trend in the data from this small sample study suggests the hypothesis that a protective effect may exist against the formation of osteosarcoma for individuals consuming fluoridated water. 
Postoperative computed tomography study of pterygomaxillary separation during the Le Fort I osteotomy. Computed tomography (CT) was used postoperatively to assess the pterygomaxillary region in 12 orthognathic surgery patients who had had a Le Fort I osteotomy. Although pterygomaxillary separation was successful in all cases, in only 41.6% of the sides did fractures of the plate not occur. The incidence of low pterygoid plate fracture was 37.5% and that of high pterygoid plate fracture was 25%; 4.2% of sides showed a maxillary tuberosity fracture. Multiple fractures were observed in 8.3% of separated plates. Of 17 pterygoid plates judged clinically to be intact, only 10 were intact as assessed by CT. The significance of these findings and application of CT to evaluation of modifications to the Le Fort I osteotomy is discussed. 
Inhibition of interferon-inducible gene expression by adenovirus E1A proteins: block in transcriptional complex formation. Infection with wild-type adenovirus 5, but not with a mutant lacking the E1A gene, prevented the induction by interferon (IFN) alpha of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity in HeLaM cell lines that had been permanently transfected with chimeric CAT reporter genes driven by the transcriptional regulatory regions of the IFN-responsive genes 561 and 6-16. Similar inhibition of IFN-inducible CAT activity was observed in cells that were cotransfected with the same reporter genes and plasmids expressing either the E1A 289- or 243-amino acid protein. These proteins also prevented the induction of CAT activity by IFN-gamma from a cotransfected HLA-DR alpha-CAT gene. Experiments with E1A mutants mapped the inhibitory activity to amino acid residues 38-65 of these proteins. In a HeLa cell line permanently expressing the E1A 289-amino acid protein, the replication of vesicular stomatitis virus and encephalomyocarditis virus was not inhibited by IFN-alpha, suggesting a global blockade of IFN responses. In accord with this theory, induction of 561, 1-8, and (2'-5')oligoadenylate synthetase mRNAs by IFN was blocked in these cells at the transcriptional level. The observed transcriptional inhibition could be attributed to the lack of formation of the crucial IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) transcriptional complex. As shown by mobility shift assays, this complex was not formed in the nuclear extracts of IFN-treated adenovirus-infected cells or IFN-treated E1A-producing cells. These nuclear extracts were deficient in both ISGF3 alpha and ISGF3 gamma subunits. However, they did not block the formation of ISGF3 complex from exogenously added components. 
Acute airway obstruction in relapsing polychondritis: treatment with pulse methylprednisolone. We describe 2 adolescents with relapsing polychondritis who developed acute airway obstruction. Both were successfully treated with intravenous steroids for this complication following failure with oral steroids. Early respiratory tract involvement in younger patients seems predictive of a poor outcome and aggressive therapy with intravenous high dose steroids and/or immunosuppressive drugs appears to be indicated. 
Screening dyspepsia by serology to Helicobacter pylori. Owing to limited endoscopy resources, various screening strategies for endoscopy have been proposed. Helicobacter pylori can be detected with high sensitivity and specificity by serology, and therefore we assessed the effects on diagnostic accuracy and endoscopic workload of a policy of screening clinic patients with dyspepsia before endoscopy by a strategy based on age, Helicobacter pylori serology, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 1153 patients were studied, of whom 842 were of known histological H pylori status (histology group) and 293 had serum assessed prospectively by in-house and commercial ELISAs for detection of IgG antibodies to H pylori. Overall, the screening strategy would have reduced endoscopy workload by 23.3% (95% confidence interval 20.9-25.8%) and would have had a sensitivity for detection of peptic ulcer of 97.4% (94.5-99.1%). No peptic ulcer or malignant disease was missed in the patients studied prospectively, but 6 of 192 peptic ulcers in the histology group would have been missed. A policy of screening young dyspeptic patients for H pylori by serology is more sensitive than symptom-based screening strategies, and may have an important role in reducing endoscopy workload. 
Use of secondary prophylaxis against myocardial infarction in the north of England OBJECTIVE--To record the use of secondary prophylactic drugs in patients discharged from hospital having had a myocardial infarction. DESIGN--Prospective postal questionnaire survey of a random one in two sample of general practitioners in the region. SETTING--The nine family practitioner committee areas within the Northern Regional Health Authority. PATIENTS--Patients who had had a myocardial infarction and were discharged to their general practitioner. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Whether beta blockers or aspirin, or both, were given on discharge. RESULTS--Of 267 patients, 158 (59%) were treated suboptimally in that they did not receive a secondary prophylactic drug to which they had no contraindication. For most patients this entailed underuse of one drug, but 17 (6%) of patients received no treatment. beta Blockers were 2.5 times less likely to be used than aspirin. Treatment was not associated with the age or sex of the patient, risk of further infarction, or hospital of discharge. CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis after myocardial infarction is practised haphazardly. It should be offered to all patients who can tolerate it, after a trial period to assess any side effects of the drugs if necessary. 
Management of the medial canthal tendon in nasoethmoid orbital fractures: the importance of the central fragment in classification and treatment. The medial canthal tendon and the fragment of bone on which it inserts ("central" fragment) are the critical factors in the diagnosis and treatment of nasoethmoid orbital fractures. The status of the tendon, the tendon-bearing bone segment, and the fracture pattern define a clinically useful classification system. Three patterns of fracture are appreciated: type I--single-segment central fragment; type II--comminuted central fragment with fractures remaining external to the medial canthal tendon insertion; and type III--comminuted central fragment with fractures extending into bone bearing the canthal insertion. Injuries are further classified as unilateral and bilateral and by their extension into other anatomic areas. The fracture pattern determines exposure and fixation. Inferior approaches alone are advised for unilateral single-segment injuries that are nondisplaced superiorly. Superior and inferior approaches are required for displaced unilateral single-segment injuries, for bilateral single-segment injuries, and for all comminuted fractures. Complete interfragment wiring of all segments is stabilized by junctional rigid fixation. All comminuted fractures require transnasal wiring of the bones of the medial orbital rim (medial canthal tendon-bearing or "central" bone fragment). If the fracture does not extend through the canthal insertion, the canthus should not be detached to accomplish the reduction. 
PAF-induced bowel necrosis. Effects of vasodilators. Ischemic bowel necrosis in the rat is produced by injecting platelet-activating factor (PAF) intravenously. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after PAF injection, we hypothesize that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. We thus studied the effects of vasodilators in this model. We found that: (1) Phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615 (leukotriene antagonist) and PGE1 counteracted the PAF-induced mesenteric flow reduction and ameliorated the bowel injury. However, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin were relatively ineffective in correcting PAF-induced hypotension, showing that bowel injury can be prevented independently of the hypotensive state. (2) Nitroglycerin failed to prevent bowel injury, although it improved the mesenteric blood flow. Thus, in opposition to our initial hypothesis, correction of the mesenteric flow reduction induced by PAF does not always prevent intestineal necrosis. (3) Only phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615, and PGE1 ameliorated PAF-induced hemoconcentration and bowel injury. This suggests a correlation between vascular injury (expressed by "leaky" vessels and the consequent hemoconcentration) and bowel necrosis. (4) Although both nitroglycerin and hydralazine relax smooth muscle, hydralazine seemed to aggravate bowel necrosis. The mechanism remains unclear. 
Greater loop chloride uptake contributes to blunted pressure natriuresis in Dahl salt sensitive rats. A blunted pressure natriuretic response is present in Dahl salt sensitive rats. To determine whether this results from tubular or glomerular mechanisms, late proximal, early distal, and late distal micropuncture were performed in salt resistant (R), salt sensitive (S), or salt sensitive rats with renal perfusion reduced to that of R rats (S-AC). Differences in neuro-endocrine background between groups were eliminated by renal denervation and by fixing plasma aldosterone, norepinephrine, and vasopressin levels by infusion. Renal perfusion pressure was greater (P less than 0.05) and inulin clearance less (P less than 0.05) in S than R rats. Urinary sodium excretion, however, was not different. S-AC had renal perfusion pressures that were similar to R rats and inulin clearance similar to S rats. Urinary NaCl excretion was less (P less than 0.05) than either group. Single nephron inulin clearance, fluid, and chloride delivery to late proximal sites were not different between groups. Absolute and fractional chloride delivery to early distal sites was less (P less than 0.05) in S-AC than R or S but not different between R and S. Late distal chloride delivery was not different between any group. Calculated loop chloride reabsorption was greater in S-AC than R or S. Thus, the lower urinary NaCl excretion in S-AC rats is in part due to increased loop chloride reabsorption. This effect is probably intrinsic to the S kidney as it occurs despite renal denervation when plasma levels of vasopressin, norepinephrine, and aldosterone are fixed. The increased loop chloride uptake is abolished when perfusion pressure increases. 
Fistula-in-ano in Crohn's disease. Results of aggressive surgical treatment. The outcome of aggressive surgical treatment of 64 symptomatic anal fistulas in 55 patients with Crohn's disease has been studied. Forty-one fistulas, in 33 patients, were treated by conventional fistulotomy (17 subcutaneous, 19 intersphincteric, 5 low transsphincteric fistulas). Thirty wounds (73 percent) healed within 3 months and eight more wounds (93 percent) healed within 6 months. Three wounds did not heal within 12-18 months. Two of these patients subsequently required proctocolectomy. Wound healing was not influenced by the presence of rectal Crohn's disease or granulomatous inflammation in the tract. No change in continence was experienced by 26 of the 33 patients who underwent fistulotomy. Three patients required proctocolectomy and the remaining four patients experienced minor degrees of incontinence postoperatively. Sixteen high transsphincteric, five suprasphincteric, and one extrasphincteric fistula in 22 patients were treated by laying open external tracts and placing a noncutting seton through the sphincter, which was left in place for prolonged periods to maintain drainage. During follow-up (6 months to 10 years, median 2.5 years), three fistulas healed and seven remained quiescent. Nine patients required further treatment by a new seton and three patients required proctocolectomy. Eight of the 22 patients who had a seton inserted had no change in continence, and six patients in this group developed minor changes in continence, mostly related to diarrhea associated with intestinal disease. Anal fistulas in Crohn's disease, which involve minimal sphincter muscle, can be successfully treated by fistulotomy. High fistulas should be treated with seton drainage to limit recurrent suppuration and preserve sphincter function. 
Clinical applications of carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography. During an 18-month period 33 patients in whom there were contraindications to the use of iodinated contrast arteriography underwent 40 carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriograms for lower extremity ischemia (19), severe hypertension and renal insufficiency (12), or arterial aneurysm (2). Contraindications to iodinated contrast agents included renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and contrast hypersensitivity. Sixteen aortic, 15 iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial, five aorta-iliac-femoral and four aorta-iliac-femoral-popliteal-tibial carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies were performed. In 11 studies, imaging of selected arterial segments required the addition of 10 to 60 ml of dilute nonionic contrast. Guided by carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography studies four femoral-tibial bypasses, three aneurysmorrhaphies, two aortorenal bypasses, one aortofemoral bypass and one femoral-femoral bypass were successfully performed in 11 patients. In addition, carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography directed angioplasties of the common iliac (4), superficial femoral (6), popliteal (3), or tibioperoneal trunk (1) were performed in 10 patients. Complications of carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography included transient deterioration in renal function in three patients in whom 20 ml of nonionic contrast was used, a nonfatal myocardial infarction after a popliteal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in one patient, and transient tachypnea and tachycardia during a carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography study in one patient. Diagnostic arteriograms are obtainable using carbon dioxide as the contrast agent. Carbon dioxide/digital subtraction arteriography permits patients with symptomatic arterial disease at high risk for contrast related complications to safely undergo arteriography and subsequent arterial reconstruction or endovascular intervention. 
Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201 to evaluate patients before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Thallium-201 imaging may be used to help determine the distribution and amount of myocardium in jeopardy and the success of revascularization after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Single photon emission computed tomography is particularly advantageous because of its ability to differentiate vascular territories and thus evaluate patients with multivessel disease. Myocardial infarction resulting from complications such as distal embolization and side-branch occlusion can be detected. Thallium-201 imaging early after angioplasty may show abnormal results caused by transiently insufficient coronary flow reserve. However, studies performed 6 weeks or more after angioplasty accurately detect early restenosis and may identify those individuals likely to become symptomatic and eventually develop restenosis in the future. 
Comparative experience with smooth and polyurethane breast implants using the Kaplan-Meier method of survival analysis. Smooth-walled silicone implants have been widely used in breast surgery. Capsular contracture, causing undesirable firmness and spherical deformity, has been a common problem. Recent studies suggest that polyurethane-covered breast implants are associated with a lower incidence of capsular contracture. The statistical methodology employed in some of these studies, however, may be subject to criticism. Between July of 1984 and June of 1990 (72 months), 427 polyurethane breast implants were used in 279 patients and 439 smooth prostheses were used in 250 patients for a variety of aesthetic and reconstructive procedures. The occurrence of capsular contracture was carefully monitored and then analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method of survival analysis. This method is particularly well suited to analysis of these types of clinical data because it allows for the fact that contractures occur at varying intervals after surgery and that follow-up of patients is incomplete. The probability of capsular contracture with smooth-walled prostheses was found to be significantly greater than with polyurethane-covered implants in each group of patients studied (p less than 0.05). Other complications occurred at a similar rate regardless of prosthesis type. This study supports the belief that polyurethane breast implants have a lower contracture rate; furthermore, it introduces the Kaplan-Meier method for analyzing the outcome of alternative plastic surgical therapies. 
Limb-sparing surgery in skeletally immature patients with osteosarcoma. The use of an expandable prosthesis. Limb-sparing surgery has a definite role in the treatment of osteosarcoma in children. Increased survival, however, raises problems of limb-length discrepancy and prosthetic longevity. The concept of an expandable adjustable prosthesis addresses the problem of leg-length discrepancy. The problem of prosthesis longevity will require further long-term evaluation of current designs and methods of fixation, as well as the development of a permanent prosthesis or biologic replacement. At skeletal maturity, the expandable prosthesis may either be maintained or substituted with another implant or biological alternative if warranted by the clinical situation. 
Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins. Nonthrombotic occlusion or stenosis of the mesenteric veins is a rare cause of intestinal ischemia that usually occurs in association with systemic vasculitis. The current report includes four male patients with segmental ischemic colitis caused by idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia in the small mesenteric veins and their intramural branches; neither vasculitis nor arterial involvement were present. Three of the four patients were less than or equal to 38 years of age; the fourth was 67. All four patients were previously healthy and had no history of drug use of any kind. Clinical findings included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, and colonic strictures discovered by barium enema. The intima of the mesenteric and intestinal mural veins was focally thickened by a marked increase in cells and matrix between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina, whereas the vessel walls external to the thickened intima appeared normal. Histochemistry and immunoreactivity with antibodies to muscle-specific actins (HHF-35) disclosed that the intimal thickening was caused by proliferation of smooth muscle cells in a proteoglycan matrix. All patients recovered completely after segmental resection of the ischemic portion of the colon and had no recurrence of intestinal symptoms on follow-up of up to 7 years. These unusual venous lesions do not appear to have been previously described; their etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. 
In situ human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in South African and British patients: evidence for putative HPV integration in vivo. In South Africa asymptomatic wart virus infection diagnosed by morphological criteria occurs in 16-20% of all ethnic groups; the incidence in black women is 66%. To identify human papillomavirus (HPV) types the prevalence of HPV in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in South African women (n = 72) with age matched British women (n = 73) was compared by non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) using digoxigenin labelled probes for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 on archival biopsy specimens. A higher proportion of British biopsy specimens (68%) contained HPV than those from South Africa (50%) in CIN 2 and 3; this difference was due to HPV 16. Thirty six per cent of the positive biopsy specimens from South African women also contained HPV 33/35 compared with 16% in the United Kingdom. There was no difference in HPV detection with age in either group. These data indicate that HPV types vary geographically, with "minor" HPV types being more common in South Africa. Three qualitatively distinct NISH signals were observed; a diffuse (type 1) signal in superficial cells, mainly koilocytes; a punctate signal (type 2) in basal/"undifferentiated" cells in CIN 3; and combined type 1 and 2 signals in CIN with wart virus infection (type 3). The punctate signal may represent HPV integration. 
A controlled study of caudal epidural injections of triamcinolone plus procaine for the management of intractable sciatica. The management of sciatica due to lumbar nerve root compromise remains controversial, probably because few well-controlled studies of conservative management have been performed. This preliminary study assesses the efficacy of epidural injections of 80 mg triamcinolone acetonide plus 0.5% procaine hydrochloride in saline, administered via the caudal route, in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial with 1 year follow-up. Twenty-three patients were entered into the study: 12 received treatment and 11 placebo. The active group showed significant pain relief (P = 0.02) and a significant increase in mobility (P = 0.01) at 4 weeks, which resulted in improved quality of life (P = 0.02). At 1 year, subjective and objective measures improved in both groups. The improvement was greater in the actively treated group, but only the objective assessment (straight leg raise) was statistically significant. 
A prospective study of incisional time, blood loss, pain, and healing with carbon dioxide laser, scalpel, and electrosurgery. Carbon dioxide laser incisions are reported to be less painful, less bloody, and less prone to seroma formation and to heal better than scalpel or electrosurgical incisions. We compared all three modalities in a prospective randomized study of cholecystectomy incisions. Time required for the incision and incisional blood loss was less with electrosurgery than with the carbon dioxide laser or scalpel. Postoperative pain and wound healing, however, were the same for all three techniques. The carbon dioxide laser appears to offer no advantage over conventional means of making a standard incision. 
Glial swelling following human cerebral contusion: an ultrastructural study. The ultrastructural features of cerebral contusion seen three hours to 11 days after head injury were studied in 18 patients undergoing surgery. Massive astrocytic swelling ("cytotoxic" oedema) was seen three hours to three days after injury, maximal in perivascular foot processes, and compressing some of the underlying capillaries. The tight junctions were not disrupted. Neuronal damage was most marked three to 11 days after injury. The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to oedema formation and neuronal degeneration are discussed. 
Extraperitoneal approach for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by dense perianeurysmal fibrosis involving the adjacent organs. Attempts to isolate the aneurysm can lead to operative injuries of these structures, thus increasing the rates of complications and mortality. In the last 12 years 45 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent aneurysm resection at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Rome. The aneurysm was resected through a standard, midline transperitoneal approach in 39 patients, through a thoracophrenolaparotomy in two patients, and through a left-flank extraperitoneal approach in the last four patients. The extraperitoneal approach simplified aneurysm dissection and aortic clamping with no cases of postoperative morbidity or death. In addition, we reviewed the CT scan findings of 12 patients surgically treated for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. The amount of fibrosis in the anterior wall of the aneurysm was greater than in the left posterolateral aspect (p = 0.008). We conclude that the left-flank extraperitoneal approach is the most anatomically advantageous route for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. 
Induction of sustained patency after clot-selective coronary thrombolysis with Hybrid-B, a genetically engineered plasminogen activator with a prolonged biological half-life. BACKGROUND. Despite the utility of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in eliciting coronary thrombolysis clinically, early reocclusion remains a problem, occurring despite anticoagulation in 5-30% of patients with initially successful recanalization. This study evaluated the utility of Hybrid-B, a molecular variant of t-PA with a prolonged half-life in the circulation, in eliciting coronary thrombolysis and maintaining patency in the presence of a continuing thrombogenic stimulus. METHODS AND RESULTS. In intact, anesthetized dogs, either 18 mg Hybrid-B over 30 minutes (n = 15) or 50 mg t-PA (Activase) over 60 minutes (n = 8) was administered starting 60 minutes after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion was induced with a thrombogenic copper coil. Time to lysis averaged 54 +/- 26 (means +/- SD) minutes and 64 +/- 34 minutes with Hybrid-B and t-PA, respectively (p = NS). When Hybrid-B was administered as a bolus (20 mg over 1 minute) to induce a high initial concentration in blood, time to lysis was shortened markedly and averaged 15 +/- 5 minutes. Dogs given Hybrid-B by either infusion or bolus exhibited prolonged time to reocclusion (337 +/- 192 minutes compared with 192 +/- 125 minutes in dogs given t-PA, p less than 0.03), reflecting maintenance of a subthrombolytic but persistently active concentration of activator in blood. Despite the persistence of Hybrid-B in blood, concentrations of fibrinogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin were not depleted markedly and remained at 77 +/- 25 and 56 +/- 24%, respectively, of control values. CONCLUSIONS. Thus, Hybrid-B, a novel variant of t-PA with unique pharmacokinetic properties, elicits prompt, sustained, and clot-selective coronary thrombolysis. 
The use of masseter electromyography with electroneurography in the evaluation of facial paralysis. In the evaluation of facial paralysis, electroneurography provides a quantitative assessment of the degree of degeneration. Near the endpoint of degeneration, the facial musculature compound action potential may be contaminated by masseter artifact resulting from supramaximal stimulation. We propose the use of both masseter electromyography and electroneurography in the evaluation of advanced degeneration to better define the current level for supramaximal stimulation, to eliminate masseter artifact, and to more accurately assess the degree of facial nerve degeneration. 
Usefulness of weightlifting training in improving strength and maximal power output in coronary artery disease. The effects of 10 weeks (20 sessions) of combined weightlifting and aerobic training (n = 10) were compared with the effects of aerobic training alone (n = 8) on indexes of strength and aerobic exercise capacity in 18 men with coronary artery disease (CAD). Initial test performance was similar between groups. After aerobic training, the maximal load that could be lifted once only (1-repetition maximum) in single-arm curl, single-leg press and single-knee extension exercises increased by 13% (11.8 to 13.3 kg; p less than 0.01), 4% (97.0 to 101.0 kg; difference not significant) and 5% (28.2 to 29.7 kg; difference not significant), respectively; corresponding gains with combined weightlifting and aerobic training were 43% (12.2 to 17.4 kg; p less than 0.01), 21% (99.0 to 120.0 kg; p less than 0.01) and 24% (29.0 to 36.0 kg; p less than 0.01). After aerobic training, the initial 1-repetition maximum could be lifted an average of 4 times, compared with 14 times after combined training. Maximal progressive incremental cycle ergometer power output increased by 2% in the aerobic control group (1,088 to 1,113 kpm/min; difference not significant) and by 15% (1,030 to 1,180 kpm/min; p less than 0.05) in the experimental group. Cycling time at 80% of initial maximal power before attaining a Borg (0 to 10) rating of perceived exertion of 7 (very severe) increased by 11% (604 to 672 seconds; difference not significant) and by 109% (541 to 1,128 seconds; p less than 0.05) in the control and weight-trained patients, respectively. 
Neoplasms associated with pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma. We found a high prevalence of pulmonary and extrapulmonary neoplasms in patients with pulmonary eosinophilic granuloma (PEG) who were studied at our institution. Among 21 patients with PEG, 10 (48%) had associated benign (one patient) or malignant (nine patients) tumors. Patients with tumors were older at the time of diagnosis of PEG (48.9 vs 34.5 years). Tumors included three lung carcinomas, one pulmonary carcinoid tumor, two lymphomas, five extrapulmonary carcinomas, and one mediastinal ganglioneuroma. Two malignant neoplasms developed in each of two patients. Six tumors preceded, three followed, and three occurred concomitantly with the diagnosis of PEG. Slides from eight PEG-associated tumors and 18 control neoplasms from patients without PEG were also stained immunohistochemically for S100 protein. Four PEG-associated (50%) and 11 control (61%) tumors contained S100 protein-positive interstitial cells. Our study suggests, but does not prove, that there may be more than a random association between PEG and neoplasms. Cigarette smoking, moreover, is an important risk factor for both PEG and lung carcinomas. Our immunohistochemical findings indicate that S100 protein-positive cells in tumors usually bear little or no relationship to PEG. In patients with an underlying malignant neoplasm, PEG simulates pulmonary metastases clinically and, occasionally, histopathologically. 
One hundred patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer treated by resection: analysis of prognostic determinants. One hundred patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer underwent 'radical' liver resection from 1980 to 1989. At least 1 cm of normal parenchyma surrounded the tumour and no microscopic invasion of resection margins was evident. The disease was staged according to our own staging system. Lobectomy was performed in 50 patients and non-anatomical resection in the remainder. The postoperative mortality rate was 5 per cent and the major morbidity rate was 11 per cent. The actuarial 5-year survival rate for patients in stages I, II and III was 42 per cent, 34 per cent and 15 per cent respectively (P less than 0.001). The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 30 per cent. The prognostic importance of various patient and tumour variables was evaluated by univariate analysis and then by multivariate analysis. Age of patient, site of primary, disease-free interval between treatment of primary and of hepatic metastases, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen levels, and number of metastases, did not relate to prognosis, while sex (P = 0.024), stage of primary (P = 0.026), extent of liver involvement (P less than 0.001), distribution of metastases (P = 0.01) and type of surgery (P = 0.028) significantly affected prognosis as single factors. Multivariate analysis revealed that only the extent of liver involvement and stage of the primary tumour were independent predictors of survival. We conclude that liver resection is effective in selected patients with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. In resectable patients it is not yet possible to formulate a clear prognosis based on clinical factors. The extent of liver involvement and the staging system used may be significant, although not absolute, indicators of outcome. 
Secondary erythrocytosis due to a cerebellar hemangioblastoma: demonstration of erythropoietin mRNA in the tumor. Cerebellar hemangioblastoma is a rare cause of secondary erythrocytosis. Although the erythrocytosis is a result of erythropoietin (Ep) stimulation, direct evidence of Ep synthesis by the tumor has been lacking. In an erythrocytotic patient with a cerebellar hemangioblastoma we found elevated levels of Ep in the tumor cyst fluid and for the first time demonstrated Ep mRNA in the tumor by Northern blotting. This finding confirms cerebellar hemangioblastoma as a site of ectopic Ep production. 
Midazolam use in the emergency department. Midazolam is a new imidazobenzodiazepine derivative that is two to three times as potent as diazepam, is water-soluble, has a rapid onset and short duration of action, and produces a profound amnestic effect. These properties make it an extremely useful drug for outpatient sedation. We performed retrospective review of midazolam use in a general emergency department over a one-year period. Midazolam was used in 120 patients, 71 men and 49 women, with an average age of 46 years. The average dose given was 3.4 mg, with a range of 1 to 10 mg. In 69 of the cases (57%) other drugs were administered, most commonly an opiate. There were only four adverse reactions. One patient developed urinary retention, one patient vomited, and two patients were somnolent for a prolonged period of time. There were no serious cardiovascular or respiratory problems. We conclude that midazolam is a safe drug to use in the emergency department. Close monitoring of the patient and the availability of airway support equipment are mandatory. 
Risk factors for falls as a cause of hip fracture in women. The Northeast Hip Fracture Study Group. BACKGROUND. Although even in the elderly most falls are not associated with fractures, over 90 percent of hip fractures are the result of a fall. Few studies have assessed whether the risk factors for falls are also important risk factors for hip fracture. METHODS. To examine the importance of risk factors for falls in the epidemiology of hip fracture, we performed a case-control study of 174 women (median age, 80 years) admitted with a first hip fracture to 1 of 30 hospitals in New York and Philadelphia. Controls, matched to the case patients according to age and hospital, were selected from general surgical and orthopedic surgical hospital services. Information was obtained by direct interview. RESULTS. As measured by the odds ratio, increased risks for hip fracture were associated with lower-limb dysfunction (odds ratio = 1.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.8), visual impairment (odds ratio = 5.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.9 to 13.9), previous stroke (odds ratio = 2.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 4.0), Parkinson's disease (odds ratio = 9.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.2 to 76.1), and use of long-acting barbiturates (odds ratio = 5.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 45.0). Of the controls, 44 (25 percent) had had a recent fall. The case patients were more likely than these controls to have fallen from a standing height or higher (odds ratio = 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 5.7). Of those with hip fracture the younger patients (less than 75 years old) were more likely than the older ones (greater than or equal to 75 years old) to have fallen on a hard surface (odds ratio = 1.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.04 to 3.7). CONCLUSIONS. A number of factors that have been identified as risk factors for falls are also associated with hip fracture, including lower-limb dysfunction, neurologic conditions, barbiturate use, and visual impairment. Given the prevalence of these problems among the elderly, who are at highest risk, programs to prevent hip fracture should include measures to prevent falls in addition to measures to slow bone loss. 
Tumor markers in cancer of the colon and rectum. The primary role that tumor markers for cancer of the colon and rectum have at this time is for postoperative surveillance of those patients resected for cure who are at risk for recurrence of the disease. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels are followed by most surgeons prospectively after the potentially curative resection. This tumor marker has not been advocated as a screening test for these cancers; however, a preoperative CEA serum level is determined in those patients before the initial surgery for colon or rectal cancer. The serum level of CEA is mainly determined by tumor differentiation and stage of disease. If the CEA serum level begins to increase during the postoperative surveillance period, the recurrence of colon or rectal cancer must be suspected. Further investigations are then performed to identify the location and resectability of the recurrent disease. Monoclonal antibodies labeled with radioisotope are presently being used clinically to identify recurrence of colon and rectal cancer. Used in conjunction with elevated serum CEA levels (or other determinants of recurrent disease) these tumor markers can specifically identify site(s) of cancer recurrence. Theoretically, by attaching cancer-fighting agents (i.e., chemotherapeutic agents) to the monoclonal antibody, the site of tumor recurrence can be potentially treated, too. Hence, these "tumor-seeking missiles" may one day be used to treat cancer recurrence. 
Fluid collections developing after pancreatic transplantation: radiologic evaluation and intervention. The usefulness of real-time sonography, duplex sonography, computed tomography (CT), cystography, diagnostic aspiration, and percutaneous drainage in the diagnosis and treatment of peri-pancreatic-transplant fluid collections was retrospectively assessed in 46 recipients of extraperitoneal pancreatic transplants. Forty-four abnormalities were identified in the extraperitoneal space at sonography, including four pancreatic pseudocysts associated with malfunction of the pancreatic duct, seven abscesses, six hematomas, nine urinomas, six early postoperative fluid collections that spontaneously resolved, six cases of pancreatitis, and six cases of vascular occlusion. Sonography (including pulsed Doppler sonography) was the procedure of choice in detecting fluid collections and diagnosing pancreatitis, rejection, vascular thrombosis, and pancreatic duct malfunction. CT was diagnostic in four of six hematomas; cystography was diagnostic in seven of nine urinomas. Sonographically guided percutaneous intervention enabled three patients to avoid surgery and allowed optimal surgical planning for six patients. 
Reversible symptomatic biliary obstruction associated with ceftriaxone pseudolithiasis. Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, has been associated with the development of sludge or stones in the gallbladders of some patients treated with this medication. Such precipitates, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of the drug, sometimes cause symptoms, have simulated acute cholecystitis, and have even led to cholecystectomy in some cases. We report the first known instance of biliary obstruction and secondary pancreatitis in association with reversible ceftriaxone-induced pseudolithiasis. 
Serosal invasion as the single prognostic indicator in stage IIIA (T3N1M0) gastric cancer. Prognostic factors of gastric cancer with positive serosal invasion and regional lymph node metastasis were evaluated by multivariate analysis. Sixty-seven patients with the T3N1M0 subgroup of stage IIIA disease were evaluated, in which 34.9 +/- 13.4 nodes were dissected in extended lymph node dissection, and 6.5 +/- 6.2 were metastatic. Routine postoperative systemic chemotherapy with mitomycin C and N1-(2'-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil was administered. With this approach, the 5-year survival rate of stage IIIA disease was 47.6%. By Cox proportional hazards model, diameter of serosal invasion was the only significant determinant of prognosis in the T3N1M0 subgroup. The predicted 5-year survival rate for 24 patients with serosal invasion less than 3.0 cm in diameter was 59.5%, compared with 11.5% for 38 patients with invasion of 3.0 cm or larger in diameter. The number of metastatic nodes and the type of operation (total gastrectomy or less than total gastrectomy) did not affect the prognosis. When gastric cancer has both positive serosal invasion and metastatic regional lymph nodes, the diameter of serosal invasion is the more important factor for predicting prognosis. 
Typing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ear infections related to outcome of treatment. Of 142 patients with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA) ear infections, 88 (62 per cent) had chronic otitis media and 54 (38 per cent) external otitis. Following serotyping and pyocin typing of their bacteria, and relating the type to outcome, patients could be divided into three groups: (1) 120 patients who had no recurrence with isolation of only one PSA strain, (2) 13 patients who had recurrent infections and in whom the same PSA strain was isolated in repeated cultures, and (3) nine patients who had recurrent disease, but who had a change in their PSA strains. Most of the PSA strains isolated from patients in groups (1) and (2) were stable to pyocin, and resistent to gentamicin. Patients in the first group were all cured initially by medical management. Of the nine patients in group (3) who had a different serotype on repeated cultures, medical treatment was successful in eight (89 per cent), but of the 13 patients in group (2) who had the same Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype cultured, medical therapy failed in six (46 per cent) and mastoid surgery was required. Serotyping of Pseudomonas aeruginosa otitis may be helpful in predicting the type of management in patients who have recurrent infections. 
Deep UV photochemistry of chemisorbed monolayers: patterned coplanar molecular assemblies. Deep ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is shown to modify organosilane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) films by a photocleavage mechanism, which renders the surface amenable to further SAM modification. Patterned UV exposure creates alternating regions of intact SAM film and hydrophilic, reactive sites. The exposed regions can undergo a second chemisorption reaction to produce an assembly of SAMs in the same molecular plane with similar substrate attachment chemistry. The UV-patterned films are used as a template for selective buildup of fluorophores, metals, and biological cells. 
Positron tomographic assessment of 16 alpha-[18F] fluoro-17 beta-estradiol uptake in metastatic breast carcinoma. The positron-emitting estrogenic steroid 16 alpha-[18F]fluoro-17 beta-estradiol (FES) has been shown to exhibit selective uptake in primary breast carcinomas; the uptake of tracer by positron emission tomography (PET) is strongly correlated with the tumor estrogen-receptor concentration. We have now extended the use of this radiopharmaceutical for imaging of metastases of breast carcinoma by PET in 16 patients with clinical or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Increased uptake of FES was identified on PET images in 53 of 57 metastatic lesions (93%); only two apparent false-positive foci of FES uptake were seen. In seven of the patients, evaluable PET studies were obtained both before and after initiation of antiestrogen therapy. In all cases, there was a decrease in FES uptake in the tumor deposits after initiation of antiestrogen therapy, and the mean (+/- standard deviation) uptake decreased from 2.22 (+/- 1.23) to 0.80 (+/- 0.42) x 10(3)+ dose/ml. These results indicate that PET with FES has high sensitivity and specificity for detecting metastatic breast carcinoma and provide additional confirmatory evidence that the tumor uptake of this ligand is a receptor-mediated process. 
Acute dacryocystic retention cured by inferior turbinate infracturing. A 30-year-old man with recurrent acute dacryocystic retention had successful infracturing of the inferior turbinate bone in association with probing of the lacrimal outflow system. Enlargement of the inferior nasal meatus by fracturing the turbinate is easy to do and would be indicated before recommending a dacryocystorhinostomy in cases of acute dacryocystic retention in which the causative cast is difficult to eliminate even by large probes that can be passed down the nasolacrimal duct. 
Anti-CD18 antibody attenuates neutropenia and alveolar capillary-membrane injury during gram-negative sepsis. Activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) associated with sepsis. Adhesion of activated PMNs to endothelial monolayers is mediated by the CD18 adhesion-receptor complex on the PMN cell surface. Monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) blocks CD18-dependent PMN-endothelial adhesion in vitro and in vivo. This study was designed to determine the role of CD18-dependent PMN adhesion in ALI associated with gram-negative sepsis. Anesthetized, ventilated (FiO2 0.5, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O) pigs received sterile saline (control, n = 8) or live Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 x 10(8) colony-forming units/ml at 0.3 ml/20 kg/min (septic, n = 9) for 1 hour. A third group (n = 7) received MoAb 60.3, 2 mg/kg intravenously, 15 minutes before Pseudomonas infusion. Animals were studied for 300 minutes. MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) attenuated the neutropenia seen in sepsis (15 +/- 1 vs 6 +/- 1 x 10(3) PMNs/mm3 at 300 min). Alveolar-capillary membrane injury was assessed by bronchoalveolar-lavage protein content and extravascular lung water determination. MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced BAL protein at 300 minutes (388 +/- 75 vs 1059 +/- 216 micrograms/ml in septic animals) and attenuated the increase in extravascular lung water to 240 minutes (7.1 +/- 2 vs 14.2 +/- 1.2 ml/kg in septic animals). Systemic hypotension, decreased cardiac index, pulmonary hypertension, and relative hypoxemia, all characteristic of this model, were not altered by MoAb 60.3. These data suggest that, in this model of septic ALI, neutropenia is, in part, CD18 dependent and that blocking CD18-dependent PMN adhesion protects the alveolar-capillary membrane independently of altered hemodynamic status. 
Evidence for central alpha-2 adrenoceptors, not imidazoline binding sites, mediating the ethanol-attenuating properties of alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists. The role of central adrenoceptors in the ethanol-attenuating effects of alpha-2 adrenoceptor blockers was investigated in mice; the centrally active antagonist atipamezole was compared with L 659,066, which penetrates the brain poorly. L 659,066 (1-10 mg/kg) had no effect on the hypothermia induced by ethanol (2 g/kg) or ethanol ataxia (2.4 g/kg), whereas atipamezole (1 mg/kg) significantly attenuated both ethanol-induced hypothermia and ataxia. Atipamezole (1-3 mg/kg) significantly attenuated the ethanol-induced reduction in exploratory head-dipping in a holeboard test whereas L 659,066 was only effective at a dose of 1 mg/kg, higher doses (3 and 10 mg/kg) and a lower dose (0.3 mg/kg) were ineffective. Atipamezole was without effect on ethanol's locomotor stimulant effect in the holeboard but L 659,066 attenuated this effect at doses less than 3 mg/kg Many alpha-2 adrenoceptor ligands also have affinity for nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding sites. The role these sites may play in attenuating ethanol's effects was investigated by comparing RX 821002 (methoxy idazoxan), which has little or no affinity for imidazoline-binding sites with atipamezole. Both atipamezo 1 e (1 mg/kg) and RX 821002 (0.06-0.2 mg/kg) significantly attenuated ethanol-induced hypothermia, ataxia and reduction in head-dipping, but were without effect on ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation. These results suggest that nonadrenergic imidazoline-binding sites are not implicated in the ethanol-attenuating properties of alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonists. 
Pulmonary oedema following relief of upper airway obstruction in the Pierre-Robin syndrome: a consequence of early palatal repair? Pulmonary oedema occurred following relief of an acute upper airway obstruction in an infant with Pierre-Robin syndrome undergoing cleft palate repair. We anticipate an increased prevalence of this phenomenon in view of the present trend for early palatal repair, and would advocate the routine use of a nasopharyngeal airway after operation in infants with severe micrognathia. 
Assessing the denominator problem in community-oriented primary care. Determination of health care needs is an essential cornerstone of community-oriented primary care (COPC). Many physicians, lacking research resources, may generalize their own patient registry data to the community. But practice populations are likely to differ significantly from community populations. This study compared demographics, health status, and medical care utilization in a sample of 990 elderly living in the community and 250 elderly patients registered at the St. Elizabeth Hospital Family Health Center in Youngstown, Ohio. The community survey and patient registries were comparable on key demographic characteristics. But statistically significant differences were observed for functional status and a number of chronic medical conditions. Comparisons of symptomatology, use of health aides, subjective health status, depression, and stress produced no significant differences. Overall health care utilization patterns were similar. The elderly family health center patients were more representative of the non-institutionalized elderly in the community than expected. And although the clinical significance remains uncertain, these findings suggest that this practice sample may be used with caution for COPC planning. But considerably more research must be undertaken in a variety of practice settings before the use of practice populations for COPC planning is widely applied. 
Comparison of thermodilution and transthoracic electrical bioimpedance cardiac outputs. Current methods of measuring cardiac output require the invasive insertion of a thermodilution catheter with its concomitant risks and complications. We examined the noninvasive method of transthoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB) in comparison with thermodilution cardiac outputs in a sample of 44 critically ill patients with poor left ventricular function (left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30%) and with either ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. Dyspnea, mitral regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, and difference between real and ideal weight had the most marked effects on the correlation between the two methods, with lesser influence by left ventricular ejection fraction, height, weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and aortic regurgitation. TEB and thermodilution cardiac outputs were correlated, at r = 0.51 (p less than 0.00009), but the low reliability and low percentage of TEB readings within 0.5 L/min of thermodilution cardiac outputs (31%) renders TEB inadequate for clinical measurement of cardiac outputs in this patient population. 
Rationale for treatment. Based on substantial evidence, the 1984 NIH Consensus Development Conference concluded that the treatment of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol elevations with diet and, when necessary, with drugs, can reduce the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Accordingly, in 1988 the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) published guidelines for defining moderate-, borderline-high-, and high-risk categories for CAD. Many clinical trials have supported the benefits of antihyperlipidemic therapy. Evidence from the Coronary Primary Prevention Trial gave rise to the "2:1 ratio," i.e., that a 1% reduction in total cholesterol level is associated with a 2% decrease in CAD events. The Helsinki Heart Study results indicated that additional benefit may be obtained by raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels. Dramatic reductions in LDL and total cholesterol were achieved by the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias, which also achieved a 35% reduction in CAD events and a two-thirds reduction in both coronary bypass operations and angioplasties. Long-term benefits of cholesterol lowering in terms of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality have been shown in the Coronary Drug Project and the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial. Two major studies that have documented angiographic changes as a result of cholesterol lowering are the Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) and the Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS). In both CLAS and FATS, there was a decrease in the development of new lesions and a lowering of the rate of progression of existing lesions. In FATS, there was also evidence that aggressive antihyperlipidemic therapy will decrease existing lesions in some CAD patients. 
Postoperative radiotherapy in the management of spinal cord ependymoma. Fifty-eight patients with histologically verified spinal cord ependymomas were treated at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Atkinson Morley's Hospital between 1950 and 1987. The median age in this series was 40 years (range 1 to 79 years) and the male:female ratio was 1.8:1. Ten patients had tumors in the cervical cord and 10 in the thoracic cord; 14 tumors involved the conus medullaris and 24 the cauda equina. Forty ependymomas were grade I and 13 were grades II to IV (in five patients there was insufficient material for grading). Eleven patients underwent biopsy only, 33 had partial or subtotal resection, and 14 had complete resection. Forty-three patients received postoperative radiotherapy. The median follow-up period was 70 months (range 3 to 408 months). Cause-specific survival rates were 74% and 68% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. On univariate analysis, age, histological grade, postoperative neurological function, and era of treatment were significant prognostic factors for survival. The histological grade was the only significant independent prognostic factor. The relative risk of death from ependymoma was 9.0 for patients with tumor grades II to IV compared to grade I (p less than 0.005, 95% confidence interval 2.7 to 30). The survival rates of patients following complete excision were significantly better compared to those after incomplete surgery (p less than 0.025). The majority of completely resected neoplasms were low-grade cauda equina tumors. Despite incomplete surgery, 5- and 10-year progression-free survival rates following radical radiotherapy were both 59%, and cause-specific survival rates were 69% at 5 years and 62% at 10 years. This suggests that radiotherapy may achieve long-term tumor control in over half of those patients with residual spinal ependymoma. 
The morphometric histopathology of undescended testes and testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernia: a comparative study. The underlying injury to undescended testes may be hormonal, a transient perinatal form fruste of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism characterized by blunting of the surge in gonadotropins normally seen at age 60 to 90 days. Ischemia is the underlying injury to testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias. To determine if the histopathology of these 2 injuries is different histomorphometric analyses were performed on semithin microscopic sections of biopsies of 21 control testes, 17 undescended testes and 13 intrascrotal testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias. The infants in all groups were 30 to 120 days old. The results showed that, as in previous studies, undescended testes at this age are characterized by hypoplasia of Leydig cells, normal germ cell counts and defective maturation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia. In contrast, testes associated with incarcerated inguinal hernias were characterized by hyperplasia of Leydig cells, reduced germ cell counts and normal maturation of gonocytes into adult dark spermatogonia. One might conclude that the underlying injury of undescended testes, presumably the blunted surge of gonadotropins, causes a primary hypoplasia and hypofunction of Leydig cells, which in turn causes a secondary defect in transformation of gonocytes into spermatogonia. In contrast, ischemia may primarily cause a tubular epithelial lesion leaving the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis intact and allowing normal transformation of gonocytes into spermatogonia. Reduced gonadotropins and ischemia appear to produce distinctly different primary and secondary pathophysiological effects on the testes. 
Laser-assisted angioplasty in the treatment of prosthetic graft stenosis. Late failure of peripheral bypass grafts has been treated primarily by secondary reconstruction. Laser-assisted angioplasty is an optional therapy that the authors investigated in 28 prosthetic grafts over a two-year period. Twenty-five symptomatic patients with 28 peripheral prosthetic arterial bypass grafts (25 polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] grafts and 1 each of knitted Dacron, Teflon, and umbilical vein) demonstrated graft occlusion (25) or high-grade stenoses (3). All patients underwent standard laser-assisted angioplasty using a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser source and hybrid probe. Twenty-one grafts (75%) were successfully recanalized with adequate restoration of flow through the conduit. All 7 failures were in occluded PTFE grafts that presented with either recalcitrant lesions (5) or perforations (2) at the distal anastomoses. There have been 3 long-term failures (14%) to date in the successfully treated group, all in PTFE grafts. Two patients suffered recurrent thrombosis and 1 developed an inexplicable graft infection five months after laser treatment. Laser-assisted angioplasty appears to be a clinically viable alternative treatment for prosthetic graft stenosis and recanalization of grafts occluded at their distal anastomosis. 
In vivo use of a radioiodinated somatostatin analogue: dynamics, metabolism, and binding to somatostatin receptor-positive tumors in man Somatostatin analogues, labeled with gamma-emitting radionuclides, are of potential value in the localization of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors with gamma camera imaging. We investigated the application in man of a radioiodinated analogue of somatostatin, 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide, which has similar biologic characteristics as the native peptide. The radiopharmaceutical is cleared rapidly from the circulation (up to 85% of the dose after 10 min) mainly by the liver. Liver radioactivity is rapidly excreted into the biliary system. Until 3 hr after injection, radioactivity in the circulation is mainly in the form of 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide. Thereafter, plasma samples contain increasing proportions of free iodide. Similarly, during the first hours after injection, radioactivity in the urine exists mainly in the form of the unchanged peptide. Thereafter, a progressive increase in radioiodide excretion is observed, indicating degradation of the radiopharmaceutical in vivo. Fecal excretion of radioactivity amounts to only a few percent of the dose. The calculated median effective dose equivalent is comparable with values for applications of other 123I-radiopharmaceuticals (0.019 mSv/MBq). 
Myocardial echinococcosis with perforation into the pericardium. Though rare, cardiac echinococcosis should be included in the differential diagnosis of cardiac tumors, particularly in patients originating from endemic areas or with manifestation of hydatid disease in other organs. Diagnosis and localisation of the cysts is best accomplished with non-invasive methods such as 2-D transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography, computed tomography and NMR. Excision of the cardiac cyst from the interventricular septum in a 21 year old patient with polyvisceral echinococcosis was performed with cardiopulmonary bypass. Adjunctive medical therapy with mebendazol is being continued for 24 months postoperatively. Twelve months after surgery the patient is asymptomatic without echocardiographic signs of recurrence. 
Vitamin B6 is effective therapy for nausea and vomiting of pregnancy: a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study. Fifty-nine women completed a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study of pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy. Thirty-one patients received vitamin B6, 25-mg tablets orally every 8 hours for 72 hours, and 28 patients received placebo in the same regimen. Patients were categorized according to the presence of vomiting: severe nausea (score greater than 7) or mild to moderate nausea (score of 7 or less). The severity of nausea (as graded on a visual analogue scale of 1-10 cm) and the number of patients with vomiting over a 72-hour period were used to evaluate response to therapy. Twelve of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had a pre-treatment nausea score greater than 7 (severe) (mean 8.2 +/- 0.8), as did ten of 28 patients in the placebo group (mean 8.7 +/- 0.9) (not significant). Following therapy, there was a significant difference in the mean "difference in nausea" score (ie, baseline - post-therapy nausea) between patients with severe nausea receiving vitamin B6 (mean 4.3 +/- 2.1) and placebo (mean 1.8 +/- 2.2) (P less than .01). In patients with mild to moderate nausea and in the group as a whole, no significant difference between treatment and placebo was observed. Fifteen of 31 vitamin B6-treated patients had vomiting before therapy, compared with ten of 28 in the placebo group (not significant). At the completion of 3 days of therapy, only eight of 31 patients in the vitamin B6 group had any vomiting, compared with 15 of 28 patients in the placebo group (P less than .05). 
Effect of otitis media on infrared tympanic thermometry. This study was designed to determine if temperature readings using a new tympanic thermometer are affected by otitis media. These readings were also compared to a rectal or oral temperature. Eighty-four children with unilateral suppurative or non-suppurative otitis media diagnosed clinically by their pediatricians were enrolled in the study. Temperatures were measured in both ears using the Thermoscan PRO-1 Instant Thermometer and rectally or orally by a glass or electronic predictive thermometer. For 67 children with unilateral suppurative otitis media the mean temperature in infected ears was 0.38 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in uninfected ears (p = .005). Neither temperatures measured in affected nor those from unaffected ears differed significantly from oral or rectal control readings. For 17 children with unilateral non-suppurative otitis media there was no statistically significant difference between temperatures in affected and unaffected ears or between the temperatures in either ear and the oral or rectal control. Our data show that temperatures taken in ears with suppurative otitis media are slightly higher than those in normal ears. This difference is of minimal clinical significance and does not affect the accuracy when compared to oral or rectal control readings. 
Electrophysiologic analysis of early Parkinson's disease. We have been interested in the application of quantitative measures of motor performance as a possible means of early detection of Parkinson's disease. To assess motor function, we have measured movement time (the physiologic correlate of bradykinesia) and reaction time (simple and directional choice) with an upper limb motor task, and tremor with accelerometry and electromyographic recordings. In this report we describe preliminary data from a Parkinson's disease patient group with symptoms of fewer than 2 years' average duration (compared with an age- and gender-matched normal control group) which indicate that precise, quantitative tests of motor function can detect the slight deviations from normal that are present in early Parkinson's disease. It appears that tests of bradykinesia are most sensitive, and detection of rest tremor is most specific. These tests may be applicable in screening individuals who are suspected of having or are "at risk for" Parkinson's disease and other related disorders. 
Inguinal endometriosis: pathogenetic and clinical implications. In six women with a preoperative diagnosis of incarcerated hernia, surgical exploration of the groin revealed inguinal endometriosis and no hernia. The affected structure was always the extraperitoneal portion of the round ligament. Six of the seven lesions were on the right. Intraperitoneal endometriosis was demonstrated in all patients. Catamenial pain was the pathognomonic symptom in the differential diagnosis of the inguinal mass. Gynecologists and surgeons should bear in mind the possibility that endometriosis may be the cause of symptoms of a suspected incarcerated inguinal hernia. Should this disease be detected at inguinal exploration, a laparoscopy is indicated during the same operation. 
Malignant hepatic tumors: P-31 MR spectroscopy with one-dimensional chemical shift imaging. To determine the clinical feasibility and applicability of phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and to assess its potential for characterization of human hepatic tissue, one-dimensional chemical shift imaging (CSI) was performed in 37 patients with various malignant hepatic neoplasms (30 metastases from a variety of primary tumors and seven hepatocellular carcinomas) and seven healthy volunteers. Tumors were grouped according to the percentage of the analyzed section that was occupied by tumor: less than 50% (group A) or more than 50% (group B). In group B, all phosphomonoester/beta-adenosine triphosphate ratios were significantly higher than normal (P less than .001). Hepatocellular carcinomas and metastases from various primary neoplasms could not be differentiated on the basis of spectral characteristics and metabolite ratios. Limitations of one-dimensional surface coil CSI prevented separation of spectra of small tumors and tumors deep within the liver parenchyma from spectra of normal liver parenchyma. 
Monocyte zinc and in vitro prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-1 beta production by cultured peripheral blood monocytes in patients with Crohn's disease. This study investigated the relationship between zinc status and prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-1 beta production by cultured monocytes in patients with Crohn's disease. Monocyte zinc was significantly decreased in both 12 inpatients and 22 outpatients compared with controls (P less than 0.001) but lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cell zinc were normal. When cultured monocytes from 10 outpatients with Crohn's disease were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, prostaglandin E2 production increased markedly, coupled with a fall in monocyte zinc. In matched controls, prostaglandin E2 production was significantly less and monocyte zinc remained stable. No difference in interleukin-1 release was noted between patients and controls. The addition of prednisolone to cell cultures suppressed prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1 synthesis, and monocyte zinc did not change. Zinc chloride augmented prostaglandin E2 production in patients, but not controls, and interleukin-1 remained stable. These results demonstrate a link between low monocyte zinc concentration and excessive prostaglandin production in patients with Crohn's disease. 
Depression and chronic fatigue in the workplace. Workers' compensation and occupational issues. There is ample evidence that some forms of depression can be caused or aggravated by work. The relationship of work and chronic fatigue syndrome is questionable, but elements at work can aggravate the symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome. The role of physicians who can support or discourage beliefs about physical illness is all important, both by what they say and how they treat. In the process of interaction, they can promote or discourage disability. The role of the physician in the workplace is to determine if an illness is work related, if it is disabling, if it requires treatment, and what treatment. The physician must advise if the worker can continue in his or her usual and customary employment and, if not, if he or she can be vocationally rehabilitated from a medical standpoint. Conditions in which physical symptoms are unsupported by physical findings and have diagnostic labels that describe the disorder without indicating either cause or pathology are especially troubling for the physician who must decide if the patient's job caused the symptoms. 
Practice patterns and costs of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. We conducted an observational study at three hospitals in Boston to examine the patterns of practice and the costs involved in the medical management of noncirrhotic, upper gastrointestinal bleeding. A total of 111 patients were identified and studied: 42 from hospital 1, 38 from hospital 2, and 31 from hospital 3. There were no significant differences in the management of the patients, except for the more frequent use of upper gastrointestinal radiography at hospital 3 and the more frequent use of cimetidine at hospital 2. Only a small percentage (3-7%) of patients required surgery, and overall mortality (0-8%) was low. The average cost of hospitalization, determined by using the New England Medical Center cost model, was calculated for direct costs ($3,180). The majority of costs incurred were for hospital bed or intensive care unit stay (63%) and transfusion of blood products (14%), with costs for physicians' services (9%), endoscopy (2%), and upper gastrointestinal radiography (1%) accounting for only a small percentage. This study demonstrates remarkable similarity in practice patterns and resource utilization at three different hospitals and provides data on the actual costs involved in hospitalization for noncirrhotic, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. 
Surgical correction of coarctation in early infancy: does surgical technique influence the result? Between 1979 and 1988, a total of 53 infants less than 1 year of age underwent repair of coarctation. Thirty-seven patients (70%) were younger than 3 months. Median age was 0.9 month. Four different surgical techniques were used: resection with end-to-end anastomosis, patch enlargement, subclavian flap aortoplasty, and subclavian displacement aortoplasty (Meier-Mendonca technique). Hospital mortality was 7.5% and was limited to patients with additional complex intracardiac defects. Neither age nor surgical technique had an influence on the operative risk. Follow-up averaged 15 to 43 months for the four different groups. Restenosis developed in 9 (19%) of 47 patients regularly followed up, 5 (11%) of whom have had reoperation. Age at operation was not a predictor for restenosis, which occurred in 17.4% of patients less than 1 month and 20.8% of those greater than 1 month of age at operation. Patch enlargement and the subclavian displacement technique demonstrated the highest restenosis rates (42% and 43%, respectively). However, patients who underwent patch enlargement had less favorable pathological conditions. It is concluded that results of coarctation repair in early infancy do not depend as much on the operative method itself as on the specific pathological aspect, which largely determines the method of treatment. Some reservation must be made in regard to the subclavian displacement technique. 
Characterization of target injury of murine acute graft-versus-host disease directed to multiple minor histocompatibility antigens elicited by either CD4+ or CD8+ effector cells. The precise identity of effector mononuclear cells capable of eliciting acute graft-versus-host disease (AGVHD) is controversial. In this study, highly purified subsets of donor T cells were used to produce AGVHD to multiple minor histocompatibility (H) antigens in two strain combinations of mice matched for the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In the C3H.SW- greater than B6 strain combination, only CD8+ effector cells produced histologic evidence of AGVHD in skin and liver, which peaked 3 weeks after transplant. In the B10.D2- greater than DBA/2 strain combination, CD4+ effector cells, and to a lesser extent, CD8+ cells, mediated disease in skin, liver, and intestine, which peaked during the fourth week after transplant. Analysis of skin and liver from both combinations showed target cell injury that was phenotypically similar and resembled that previously described in human disease in other studies. In addition, prominent epithelial injury also was detected in oropharyngeal mucosa, esophagus, hepatobiliary ducts, and seminal vesicle in both transplant settings. These findings indicate that functionally different subsets of donor T cells may be capable of initiating common pathways of cellular injury in selected target sites in AGVHD, and have potential implications for strategies that seek to ablate disease development by manipulation of donor marrow before transplantation. 
Diarrhea, respiratory infections, and growth are not affected by a weekly low-dose vitamin A supplement: a masked, controlled field trial in children in southern India. Incidence, duration, and severity of diarrhea and respiratory symptoms were monitored weekly for 1 y in 15,419 children 6-60 mo of age in a randomized, placebo-controlled, masked clinical trial conducted in southern India. Half the children received weekly doses of 8.7 mumol (2500 microgram) vitamin A and 46 mumol (20 mg) vitamin E (treated) and the other half, 46 mumol vitamin E (control). Medical and ocular examinations and anthropometric measurements were obtained before and after 52 wk of intervention. Ocular examinations also were obtained after 26 wk. Supplements were delivered weekly from calibrated dispenser bottles by community health volunteers who also recorded each mother's recall of daily morbidity of her child during the previous week. Baseline characteristics of treated and control subjects were similar and documented a prevalence of 11% xerophthalmia and 72% undernutrition. Weekly treatment with the low-dose vitamin A supplement did not influence the incidence, severity, or duration of diarrhea or respiratory infections and did not influence linear or ponderal growth. 
Alcoholism in women. Women differ from men in their drinking patterns and in the biologic consequences of alcohol use. Women more often drink at home and conceal their drinking behavior. Because women have a higher percentage of body fat and a lower percentage of body water than men, the same amount of alcohol causes more severe toxic effects in women than in men. Heavy alcohol consumption in women is associated with gynecologic dysfunction and fetal alcohol syndrome. Depression, anxiety or other psychiatric illness is also common in women alcoholics. Family physicians should be alert to the subtle behaviors that suggest alcoholism and be familiar with the available community resources and treatment options. 
Transperineurial vessel constriction in an edematous neuropathy. The hypothesis that the accumulation of endoneurial edema can exert forces sufficient to occlude transperineurial vessels was tested using light microscopy and computer-assisted morphometry in rat sciatic nerve. Experimental nerves were exposed to a concentration of 10% procaine HCl, which from previous studies has been demonstrated to routinely produce an edematous neuropathy. For each vessel, a "constriction ratio" was defined by dividing its minimum intraperineurial lumen area by the average for minimum endoneurial and epineurial lumen cross-sectional areas. Constriction ratios were 0.91 +/- 0.26 (mean +/- SD) for control vessels and 0.28 +/- 0.25 for vessels in the procaine group (p less than 0.005). In addition, a strong negative correlation was observed between the morphologic demonstration of nerve edema and the transperineurial vessel constriction ratio (r = -0.85; p less than 0.002). It is concluded that in neuropathies characterized by widespread edema and increased endoneurial fluid pressures, the concomitant constriction of transperineurial vessels could diminish nerve blood flow and facilitate nerve injury. 
Successful long-term control of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome with etoposide. A 38-year-old man with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome had an inadequate response to steroids and severe side effects from hydroxyurea treatment, which necessitated withdrawal of the treatment. Successful control of clinical symptoms and eosinophil counts was obtained with etoposide (VP16-213) for 18 months. VP16-213 may be valuable in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome treatment. 
Pediatric heart transplantation at Stanford: results of a 15-year experience. The long-term results of pediatric heart transplantation were evaluated in 53 patients, aged 0.25 to 18.94 years, who received transplants at Stanford University Medical Center between 1974 and 1989. Indications for transplantation were idiopathic cardiomyopathy (68%), congenital heart disease (21%), endocardial fibroelastosis (8%), and doxorubicin cardiomyopathy (3%). Immunosuppression was achieved with combinations of cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Thirty-seven of 42 recipients leaving the hospital after transplantation were alive and in New York Heart Association class I at study's end. Cumulative survival was 79% at 1 year, 76% at 3 years, and 69% at 5 years. Fourteen recipients have survived more than 5 years (5.1 to 12.4 years). Hospital readmission for illness has been infrequent, decreasing from 6.8 days to 0.9 days per year over 5 years. Eleven patients have required no rehospitalization. Posttransplant deaths were due to infection (19%), rejection (4%), pulmonary hypertension (4%), coronary artery disease (2%), and lymphoproliferative disease (2%). Retransplantation was required for intractable rejection in 4 patients and advanced coronary artery disease in 2. Hypertension and elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were common in individuals receiving cyclosporine. Growth was often impaired in prepubertal children receiving daily prednisone. Based on this 15-year experience, it is concluded that heart transplantation represents a reasonable alternative for selected young patients with end-stage cardiac disease. 
The noncemented porous-coated hip prosthesis. A three-year clinical follow-up study and roentgenographic analysis. This was a retrospective study reviewing 68 hip arthroplasties performed with noncemented, porous-coated components at three institutions in the period between December 1983 and June 1987. Fifty of these were available for follow-up study. The mean follow-up period was three years (range, 18-56 months). Thirty-seven patients were treated by total hip arthroplasty (THA) with porous-coated components, and thirteen were implanted with porous-coated femoral stems with bipolar endoprostheses using a porous-coated femoral stem and a universal head. The mean Harris hip score at follow-up evaluation for the entire group was 85.7 points. Eighty percent of the patients had either a good or excellent result. Those patients implanted with a porous femoral stem with bipolar acetabular components had only 54% good or excellent results compared with 90% good or excellent results for those having THA. Roentgenographic findings included a 59% rate of femoral neck cortex osteopenia, an 80% rate of medial or lateral distal cortical hypertrophy, and an 80% rate of distal bone bridging. All of these roentgenographic changes were secondary to changes in stress transference to the proximal femur. There was no correlation between thigh pain or the degree of bone-prosthesis radiolucencies and the fit of the femoral stem. 
General moderate hypothermia in the surgical treatment of descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. The diagnosis and surgical treatment of aneurysms of the descending thoracic aorta is difficult and some aspects of management remain controversial. We report 53 patients treated in the period 1983-1988; 25.9% of them had previously been erroneously diagnosed as having mediastinal cysts or tumours. Duplex scanning and computerised tomography were valuable adjuncts in establishing the correct diagnosis, which was confirmed by aortography in 52 patients. Of 49 patients operated upon electively three died with a mortality rate of 6.1%; of the 4 patients operated upon as emergencies 2 died. Fifty patients survived the operative procedure and of the 3 operated upon under normothermia 1 developed paraplegia, whereas of the 47 patients operated upon under moderate hypothermia (30 degrees-31 degrees C) only 1 developed paraplegia. 
Concentration of cefuroxime in serum and middle ear effusion after single dose treatment with cefuroxime axetil. Antimicrobial agents play an important role in the treatment of patients with acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (OME). The study was undertaken to determine the concentrations of cefuroxime in the blood and middle ear effusions (MEE) of children between 6 and 12 years of age with acute otitis media and chronic OME after a single oral dose administration of cefuroxime axetil, the ester prodrug of cefuroxime. Cefuroxime axetil (250 mg) was administered 2 to 6 hours before either myringotomy for acute otitis media or myringotomy and tube insertion for chronic OME. Blood samples and middle ear aspirates were obtained from 31 children and the samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Cefuroxime was recovered in measurable concentrations in all serum samples and in 15 (79%) of the 19 MEE specimens analyzed. No correlation was seen between cefuroxime MEE concentrations and effusion type, bacteriology or serum concentrations. This study shows that cefuroxime does penetrate into MEE when OME is present and that therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in some patients. 
Symptom reporting in wanted and unwanted pregnancies. This study examined the association between unwanted pregnancy and the reporting of pregnancy symptoms in a sample of 99 pregnant women drawn from an urban, medical school based family practice residency. Of these women, 51 had unwanted pregnancies, and 48 had wanted pregnancies. Women with wanted pregnancies were more likely than women with unwanted pregnancies to report three pregnancy symptoms (amenorrhea, breast tenderness, and morning sickness). This association of symptoms with a wanted pregnancy persisted after controlling for age, race, marital status, contraceptive use, menstrual irregularity, and days since last menses through multiple logistic regression. Findings suggest that symptoms may be underreported by women with unwanted pregnancies. 
Current treatment for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: results and surgical implications. From July 1986 to January 1991, 123 patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent operation for ablation of aberrant conduction pathways. There were 85 male and 38 female patients ranging in age from 11 months to 68 years. Associated anomalies included Ebstein's anomaly, sudden death syndrome, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathy, abdominal aortic aneurysm, neurofibromatosis, other arrhythmias, or other complex congenital heart disease. Forty-one patients had multiple accessory pathways. Operative results showed a 7% initial failure rate, which dropped to 3% after reoperation. One patient had undergone previous operation for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome at another institution. Procedures performed concomitantly included mitral or tricuspid valve repair or replacement (6), right ventricular conduit replacement, subaortic resection, Fontan repair, corrected transposition repair, coronary artery bypass, and placement of an automatic internal cardioverter defibrillator. There was no operative mortality. Late follow-up is 27 +/- 16 months, and complications included mitral regurgitation and myocardial infarction. By comparison, in the last 12 months 124 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome underwent catheter ablation using radiofrequency current. There were 9 patients with multiple pathways. One hundred twelve patients (90%) had all accessory atrioventricular connections ablated and have remained free of symptomatic tachycardia. There have been 12 failures (10%), of which 5 have had operation and 7 are being treated medically. Mean follow-up is 7 +/- 5 months, and complications included circumflex coronary artery occlusion, excessive bleeding, valve perforation, and cerebral vascular accident. 
Assessment of aortic and pulmonic stenosis by echocardiography. Doppler and imaging echocardiography are highly useful methods of identifying and quantifying both aortic and pulmonic stenosis. The presence of valve stenosis and associated regurgitation is based on detecting abnormal intracardiac velocity patterns near the affected valve. Defining the specific valve involved and the type of lesion present is based on determining the location and timing of the abnormal velocities. Both color flow imaging and duplex pulsed Doppler with two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging are highly accurate in identifying the lesions present. Quantification of the severity of stenotic lesions requires calculation of the pressure gradient across the valve and estimation of valve area; quantification of volume flow rate is frequently helpful. The pressure gradient is calculated from high velocity data acquired in the stenotic valve orifice by using the Bernoulli equation. Volume flow rate through the valve can be estimated by using Doppler velocity data and two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging data acquired at sites upstream from the stenotic valve. The continuity equation allows calculation of valve area that is based on this noninvasive stroke volume and pressure gradient data. This review characterizes flow patterns present near stenotic valves, discusses the equations required to quantify aortic and pulmonic stenosis, and then describes the clinical approach to the noninvasive quantification of both stenotic lesions. 
Pearly penile papules: absence of human papillomavirus DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. Pearly penile papules clinically resemble the sexually transmitted papular variant of genital condylomata. Histologically, however, pearly penile papules consist of fibropapillomata that lack the characteristic morphologic features of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. To study the possible association of HPV infections with pearly penile papules, we examined tissue specimens from 13 men with pearly penile papules with and without associated penile condylomata. Biopsy specimens were tested for the presence of HPV DNA by the polymerase chain reaction. None of the pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA sequences, whereas four of seven cases clinically suspected of being condylomata associated with pearly penile papules contained HPV DNA. These results confirm that pearly penile papule lesions do not contain HPV DNA; therefore, the distinction between pearly penile papules and penile condylomata is clinically significant. 
Decreased plasticity of glucoregulatory responses in aged rats: effects of chronic stress. These experiments were conducted to determine the effects of age and chronic stress on the ability of rats to attenuate stimulus-induced glucose and insulin responses during repeated exposure to a mild stressor. Young (5-month) and old (21-month) Fischer 344 male rats were either exposed to intermittent sessions of an escapable footshock stress for 3 months, or to no chronic stress. Afterwards, blood samples were obtained from each rat before, during, and after the first and fourth exposure to a novel motion stimulus. Between the first and the fourth exposure to the motion stimulus a pronounced attenuation of glucose and insulin responses was seen in both groups of young rats, and in old chronically stressed rats, but not in old control animals. Thus, it appears that the adverse effects of aging on plasticity of glucoregulatory response processes were significantly diminished by exposure of the animals to periodic challenges from their external environment. 
Prognostic significance of atrial fibrillation in advanced heart failure. A study of 390 patients. BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation is common in advanced heart failure, but its prognostic significance is controversial. METHODS AND RESULTS. We evaluated the relation of atrial rhythm to overall survival and sudden death in 390 consecutive advanced heart failure patients. Etiology of heart failure was coronary artery disease in 177 patients (45%) and nonischemic cardiomyopathy or valvular heart disease in 213 patients (55%). Mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.07. Seventy-five patients (19%) had paroxysmal (26 patients) or chronic (49 patients) atrial fibrillation. Compared with patients with sinus rhythm, patients with atrial fibrillation did not differ in etiology of heart failure, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, or embolic events but were more likely to be receiving warfarin and antiarrhythmic drugs and had a slightly higher left ventricular ejection fraction. After a mean follow-up of 236 +/- 303 days, 98 patients died: 56 (57%) died suddenly, and 36 (37%) died of progressive heart failure. Actuarial 1-year overall survival was 68%, and sudden death-free survival was 79%. Actuarial survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (52% versus 71%, p = 0.0013). Similarly, sudden death-free survival was significantly worse for atrial fibrillation than for sinus rhythm patients (69% versus 82%, p = 0.0013). By Cox proportional hazards model, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure on therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation were independent risk factors for total mortality and sudden death. For patients who had pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of less than 16 mm Hg on therapy, atrial fibrillation was associated with poorer 1-year survival (44% versus 83%, p = 0.00001); however, in the high pulmonary capillary wedge pressure group, atrial fibrillation did not confer an increased risk (58% versus 57%). CONCLUSIONS. Atrial fibrillation is a marker for increased risk of death, especially in heart failure patients who have lower filling pressures on vasodilator and diuretic therapy. Whether aggressive attempts to maintain sinus rhythm will reduce this risk is unknown. 
Limitation of no reflow injury by blood-free reperfusion with oxygenated perfluorochemical (Fluosol-DA 20%). This study was designed to assess the effects of blood-free reperfusion with oxygenated or unoxygenated intracoronary perfluorochemical (Fluosol-DA 20%) on myocardial perfusion and to determine its mechanism or mechanisms of limiting no reflow. Twenty-four dogs underwent 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 210 min of reperfusion and were randomized to either: 1) blood-free reperfusion with intracoronary oxygenated perfluorochemical (20 ml/kg per min) for 20 min followed by blood reperfusion (n = 8); 2) intracoronary unoxygenated perfluorochemical administered as in those treated with oxygenated perfluorochemical (n = 8); and 3) blood reperfusion alone (control) (n = 8). Regional myocardial blood flow was serially determined and global myocardial perfusion was assessed by an intravenous injection of the fluorescent dye (thioflavin-S). Quantitative studies were performed to determine neutrophil infiltration and extent of endothelial injury. Hemodynamic variables were similar in all groups. The zone of impaired perfusion (thioflavin negative), expressed as a percent of the left ventricle, averaged 10 +/- 2%, 6 +/- 2% and 3 +/- 1%, in control and unoxygenated and oxygenated perfluorochemical groups, respectively (control versus oxygenated perfluorochemical p less than 0.004). The reduction in thioflavin-negative area with oxygenated perfluorochemical was associated with a notable recovery of endocardial blood flow (0.97 +/- 0.22 vs. control 0.39 +/- 0.08 ml/min per g; p less than 0.04) at 210 min of reperfusion. The number of capillaries plugged by neutrophils (per 200 capillaries) in thioflavin-negative areas was similar with both oxygenated (5.9 +/- 1.4) and unoxygenated perfluorochemical (5.4 +/- 0.8) treatment and was significantly less than that with the control group (18.9 +/- 3.2, p less than 0.003). 
Estrogen and estrogen receptors in thyroid carcinomas. Thyroid tissues, composed of normal thyroid (10 cases), Graves' thyroid (4), and papillary carcinoma (10), were measured for the presence of receptors for estrogen (ER) using an enzyme-immunoassay method. The mean value of ER in papillary carcinoma tissues (4.0 +/- 3.6 fmol/mg protein) was higher than that in normal thyroid tissues (0.8 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg protein) or that in Graves' thyroids (2.6 +/- 0.9 fmol/mg protein). In 10 papillary carcinomas, 3 were from male patients and 7 were from females. The mean value of ER in the tumors from male patients (7.2 +/- 5.1 fmol/mg protein) was higher than that from female patients (2.6 +/- 1.7 fmol/mg protein). Another set of 100 thyroid tissues from normal (20 cases), Graves' disease (10), follicular adenoma (8), and papillary carcinoma (62) was also examined for the presence of estradiol (E2) using an immunohistochemical method on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections. E2-positive tissues were found in 4 (40%) of 10 Graves' thyroids, 4 (50%) of 8 adenomas, and 47 (76%) of 62 papillary carcinomas. In 62 papillary carcinomas, E2-positive tissues were found in 37 (73%) of 51 female patients and 10 (91%) of 11 male patients. In relation to relapse of the carcinomas, E2-positive carcinomas were found in 10 (71%) of 14 patients with relapse of the disease and in 14 (54%) of 26 patients with no relapse (the difference was not significant). The findings indicate that thyroid carcinomas may be estrogen-dependent, but no definite conclusions could be drawn between the biological behavior of the tumors and the E2-positivity. 
Urinary cotinine measurement in patients with Buerger's disease--effects of active and passive smoking on the disease process. Although Buerger's disease is known to be closely related to smoking, no objective analysis of the smoke-associated problems has been performed. In this study, cotinine, the major metabolite of nicotine, was used as a sensitive marker to measure levels of active smoking and the exposure of nonsmokers to tobacco smoke because it has a relatively long half-life and because cotinine levels can be determined by noninvasive means in urine. According to urinary cotinine levels, 40 patients with Buerger's disease were classified as (1) smokers: those with urinary cotinine levels above 50 ng/mg creatinine; (2) passive smokers: those with levels between 10 and 50 ng/mg creatinine; and (3) nonsmokers who did not experience noticeable passive smoking: those with levels below 10 ng/mg creatinine. There were 10 smokers, 9 passive smokers, and 21 nonsmokers. The course of the disease, after the initial treatment at our hospital, was studied retrospectively. Seven of the 10 smokers, none of the 9 passive smokers, and 4 of the 21 nonsmokers experienced aggravation of the disease. Of the four nonsmokers who experienced aggravation, three had still been smokers and one had been exposed to tobacco smoke in the workplace at the time of relapse. There was a significant difference in the aggravation rate between the smokers' group and the other two groups. Among the smokers, the seven patients whose conditions worsened showed significantly higher cotinine levels than the three remaining patients who were in the stage of remission. 
Incidence and outcome of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia among residents of Rochester, Minnesota: 1980-87. A population-based study. The incidence and outcome of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was studied in Rochester, Minnesota, during the period 1980-1987. Three hundred thirty Rochester men without a diagnosis of prostate or bladder cancer underwent prostatectomy for BPH for the first time. Mean and median ages were both seventy (range: 46-95). The incidence of initial prostatectomy for BPH among men forty-five years of age and older age-adjusted to the 1980 U.S. white male population was 642 cases per 100,000 persons per year (py). Among the 330 men undergoing initial prostatectomy for BPH, 14 (4.2%) had serious intraoperative complications, 32 (9.7%) were rehospitalized for urologic complications within thirty days of surgery, and 13 (3.9%) had other serious complications within thirty days after surgery, including 1 death (surgical mortality 0.3%). Forty-five patients (14%) required blood transfusions within thirty days of surgery. The likelihood of reoperation within six years of the initial surgery was 15.1 percent (95% CI 9.7, 20.6). Short- and long-term postoperative mortality was not statistically significantly different than expected based on age- and sex-specific mortality statistics for Rochester, Minnesota. 
Cerebral haemorrhage in a French prospective population study. The incidence of cerebral haemorrhage was studied from a population-based stroke registry. The incidence was 12.3 per 100,000 per year in women and 13.9 per 100,000 per year in men, with a peak in the eighth decade and a male preponderance. Haemorrhages were deep seated and mostly due to hypertension. Recognised clinical characteristics of haemorrhage are acute onset, convulsion, vomiting, and disturbed consciousness. This study showed that cerebral haemorrhage may present with pure motor deficit or transient deficit preceding the stroke. The mortality was 51% in the first month, and 61% by two years. 
Torticollis in children. Torticollis is a common clinical sign that is found in a variety of disorders. Childhood torticollis differs from the adult form in that congenital types are common and many frequently encountered disorders found in adults are unusual. Pediatric torticollis related to otolaryngologic conditions is reviewed, and three illustrative cases are presented. 
Peritonitis due to Rhizopus in a patient undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. A 61-year-old man who had end-stage renal disease secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension developed peritonitis due to infection with Rhizopus as a complication of receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). At the onset of infection, the patient was neither acidemic nor hyperglycemic; in addition, deferoxamine had not been administered and Elastoplast dressings had not been applied. The infection occurred after the technique for disinfection of the catheter used for CAPD had been changed. The catheter was removed, and therapy with amphotericin B was initiated. Although the patient died of apparently unrelated causes, an autopsy revealed active fungal infection with multiple abscesses and superficial invasion of the ileal wall. 
Pouchitis--is it a wastebasket diagnosis? Pouchitis is a poorly defined syndrome that is unique to patients with an ileal reservoir. During a prospective follow-up review of 215 patients who underwent ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, pouchitis was diagnosed in 30 patients (14 percent). Based on the clinical course, two distinct patterns of pouchitis were recognized: patients who experienced two or fewer episodes (Group 1-18 patients) and patients who experienced at least three episodes (Group 2-12 patients). Histopathologic review of resected colons revealed a preponderance of indeterminate colitis in patients in Group 2 (58.3 percent) compared with patients in Group 1 (0 percent). In Group 1; 88.9 percent of patients responded to therapy with metronidazole. Only 25 percent of patients in Group 2 responded to metronidazole alone. Most patients in Group 2 required sulfasalazine, topical steroids, or both. Of the 30 patients with pouchitis, four (13.3 percent) had a distinct endoscopic pattern of distal inflammation. This subset of patients with short strip pouchitis was successfully treated with topical steroid preparations. The clinical differences suggest different causes of pouchitis in these two groups. 
Capillary haemangiomas: an approach to their management. Twenty-five children with eyelid haemangiomas were reviewed. Fifteen patients with enlarging lesions thought to be at risk of causing amblyopia were treated with intralesional steroids as soon after presentation as possible. This appeared to reduce significantly the incidence of amblyopia. Surgery was reserved for older children in whom no further involution of the lesion was expected. 
Snoring and the risk of ischemic brain infarction. To determine if a history of snoring is a risk factor for brain infarction, I conducted a case-control study of risk factors for ischemic stroke using 177 consecutive male patients aged 16-60 (mean 49) years with acute brain infarction. For each patient I chose an age-matched (+/- 6 years) male control. Arterial hypertension, coronary heart disease, snoring (habitually or often), and heavy drinking (greater than 300 g/wk) were risk factors in the stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis. The odds ratio of snoring for brain infarction was 2.13. By McNemar's test this association increased strongly if a history of sleep apnea, excessive daytime sleepiness, and obesity were all present with snoring (odds ratio 8.00). My study indicates that snoring may be a risk factor for ischemic stroke, possibly because of the higher prevalence of an obstructive sleep apnea syndrome among snorers than nonsnorers. 
Temperature-dependent modulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in cultured human astroglial cells by dexamethasone and indomethacin. In bacterial meningitis, LPS induces production in cerebrospinal fluid of the cytokines IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), which are the principle mediators of meningeal inflammation. IL-1 beta and TNF alpha induce fever, and elevated temperature may affect cytokine expression. Dexamethasone treatment improves outcome in bacterial meningitis possibly by inhibiting IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. In this report, the effects of elevated temperature and dexamethasone on LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA gene expression and protein synthesis were studied in human astrocytoma cell lines and primary cultures of human fetal astrocytes. Cells cultured at 40 degrees C exhibited smaller peaks of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha transcription and protein synthesis compared with cells cultured at 37 degrees C. The addition of dexamethasone before, during, or after exposure of the cells to LPS resulted in temperature-dependent inhibition of IL-1 beta transcription and protein synthesis. The most extensive inhibition occurred in pretreated cells cultured at 37 degrees C. Cotreatment with LPS and dexamethasone also inhibited TNF alpha mRNA transcription at both temperatures. The effects of another antiinflammatory agent, indomethacin, on LPS induction of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA were temperature and cell line dependent. These findings provide a possible explanation for the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment of bacterial meningitis and support the proposal that fever may be beneficial to the host in this disease. 
Anal tonometry: a quick method of anal manometry. Evaluation of anal sphincter tonic activity is important in the proctologic clinic. However, manometric techniques are expensive, complex, and only available in some centers. Because there is often an in-office need for having objective measurements of anal tonic activity, in our clinic we introduced a simple method for measurement of anal pressures. This method is based on the flow of air in an open circuit by using a rubber probe with a side opening at one end. Pressure is assessed by an ordinary manometric gauge for arterial pressure. With this simple instrument, the following parameters are measured: 1) anal resting pressure, 2) squeeze pressure, 3) functional length of the anal canal, and 4) descent of the perineum on staining. After testing the technique in 100 healthy persons, it was applied to 130 patients with several proctologic disorders. Differences in pressures were found between controls and patients with anal fissure (high resting pressures), and patients with anal incontinence (low resting and/or squeeze pressures). A correlation was also found between the descending perineum measured by this method and by defecography. This simple instrument is useful in the office as the first approach to the function of the anal sphincters and the pelvic floor. Nowadays, so-called anal tonometry is part of the proctologic examination in our department, because it is simple, reliable, and takes only a few minutes. 
Analysis of inflammatory cells and complement C3 in bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis. Immunohistochemical analysis of the inflammatory cells and complement C3 in the rat skeletal muscle was performed chronologically in bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis. At 30 minutes after injection, polymorphonuclear leukocytes appeared and increased in number, with a peak value at 12 hours, while macrophages reached the highest level at 2 days. In contrast, T cells comprised only a small population. Two weeks after the injection, all types of the inflammatory cells returned to the normal level. Deposition of complement C3 was recognized at 60 minutes at the surface membrane of degenerating muscle fiber. Our observation suggests the importance of both polymorphonuclear leukocytes and complement C3 in the early stage, and macrophages in the later stage of bupivacaine-induced myonecrosis. In addition, our findings cast doubt on the pathological significance of T cells in this model. 
Anterior urethral polyp associated with hematuria in six-year-old child. Anterior urethral polyps are rare, occur only in male patients, and have been associated with obstruction, terminal hematuria, and enuresis. We believe this is the fifth reported case of anterior urethral polyp associated with terminal hematuria. The radiographic findings, treatment, and pathology are reviewed. 
Toward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. II. Psychological and phenomenological aspects. The present paper is the second of a 2-part series in which extant empirical literature concerning fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is reviewed in order to provide a preliminary approach to forming an integrated understanding of the syndrome. Research on psychological disturbance in FS is reviewed with particular emphasis on affective dysfunction among FS patients. The phenomenology of FS is then described. We attempt to suggest that FS represents a quantitatively and qualitatively experience distinct from similar chronic pain syndromes. Substantive findings in FS research are summarized in the final section and potential ways in which these findings might be integrated to provide a more cohesive model for future research are suggested. 
Protracted outbreak of severe delta hepatitis: experience in an isolated Amerindian population of the Upper Orinoco basin. In an investigation of a 21-year-old epidemic of severe hepatitis, 80 serum samples were studied from two isolated Yanomami Amerindian populations of the Upper Orinoco basin in Venezuela. Of the assayed samples, 30.6% were positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), 53.7% were considered to reflect immunity to infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and only 16.2% were believed to reflect susceptibility to HBV infection; 82.5% of the samples tested positive for any marker of HBV infection. Thirty-one (39.7%) of 78 samples were also positive for antibody to delta antigen, including 91.6% of those positive for HBsAg and 20.9% of those immune to HBV. Our findings provide evidence of a high prevalence of HBV infection in this population. Furthermore, the high prevalence of antibody to delta antigen strongly suggests that coinfections with HBV or superinfections with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) in HBV carriers may be an important factor in the occurrence of an unusually high number of cases of fulminant hepatitis and of chronic liver disease. Serum samples obtained at the beginning of the outbreak 13 years earlier from 36 selected cases in the same population revealed a high rate of HBV infection (96.5%). All six HBsAg carriers from whom enough serum remained to be assayed were positive for antibody to delta antigen. Our findings indicate that the outbreak coincided with the introduction of HDV into a population with an already-high prevalence of HBV infection. 
Hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection mimicking metastatic cancer to the liver. A cholestatic syndrome caused by sclerosing cholangitis and papillary stenosis has been described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection. The case of a 41-year-old homosexual man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and cholestasis is reported. A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram showed that the extrahepatic and right-sided intrahepatic ducts were normal. Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver. Guided needle biopsies of several of these lesions showed severe confluent necrotizing pericholangitis with cytomegalovirus-infected cells. Numerous cryptosporidia were seen attached to biliary epithelium. The unique histopathologic and radiographic features of this case should be added to the spectrum of hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. 
Obstructed central venous catheters. Restoring function with a 12-hour infusion of low-dose urokinase. Thrombotic obstruction frequently prohibits infusion through or withdrawal of blood from central venous catheters and can occur in conjunction with symptomatic thrombosis of the subclavian vein. Thirty catheters were radiographically proved to be obstructed by thrombus and had not responded to at least one instillation of 5000 units of urokinase. All catheters were treated with a 12-hour infusion of urokinase at the rate of 40,000 units/hour. The obstructing thrombus was either eliminated or reduced in size in all instances and full function was restored in all but one catheter. No bleeding complications were seen. Six patients with obstructed catheters also had symptoms of subclavian vein thrombosis. All patients with symptoms of subclavian vein obstruction became asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy even though no attempt at dissolving the thrombus obstructing the subclavian vein was made. A 12-hour infusion of low doses of urokinase can safely salvage function of obstructed catheters that otherwise may require replacement. Patients with concomitant subclavian vein thrombosis become asymptomatic on anticoagulant therapy without need to dissolve the obstructing thrombus. 
Enhanced tumor growth of both primary and established human and murine tumor cells in athymic mice after coinjection with Matrigel. Previously we found that the reconstituted basement membrane matrix Matrigel, when premixed with human small-cell lung carcinoma cells and injected subcutaneously into athymic mice, permitted tumor growth, whereas cells injected in the absence of Matrigel did not form tumors. In the present study, we examined additional cell types and determined some of the underlying mechanisms involved in the promotion of tumor formation by Matrigel. The tumor cell lines that we studied included transformed mouse Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor cells (T-EHS), human submandibular carcinoma A253 cells, mouse melanoma B16F10 cells, human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells, and human primary renal cell carcinoma cells. When coinjected subcutaneously with Matrigel, these cell lines formed rapidly proliferating tumors. Primary biopsy specimens of human colon carcinoma, when dispersed and coinjected with Matrigel, also formed tumors. Only A253, KB, and B16F10 cells formed small tumors in the absence of Martrigel, but a fivefold to tenfold increase in tumor size was observed in the presence of Matrigel. These data demonstrate a useful method for improving the growth of human tumors in athymic mice. 
GM2-gangliosidosis B1 variant: analysis of beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene mutations in 11 patients from a defined region in Portugal. The GM2-gangliosidosis B1 variant occurs at an exceptionally high frequency in the northern part of Portugal. In most patients, the disease manifests itself as a juvenile form, as opposed to the late-infantile form described for many patients from other parts of the world. We have analyzed the beta-hexosaminidase alpha gene in 11 patients, as well as in some relatives, in order to characterize the underlying abnormalities. They were screened for the two previously identified mutations responsible for the B1 variant phenotype (G533----A, also designated as the "DN allele," and C532---T) by PCR amplification of an 800-bp DNA fragment and subsequent dot-blot hybridization with allele-specific oligonucleotides. The fragment amplified from one patient was also subcloned and sequenced. Ten patients, constituting a clinically and biochemically homogeneous group, were found to be homozygous for the DN allele. The other, whose clinical profile more resembled the late-infantile phenotype often described in the literature, was a compound heterozygote carrying the DN allele and another, as yet unidentified, abnormal allele. Our results, corroborated by previously published data, suggest that homozygotes and compound heterozygotes for the DN allele may be distinguishable at the phenotypic level, depending on the nature of the abnormality in the other allele. A common ancestral origin for the DN allele can also be postulated. 
Total cavopulmonary anastomosis versus conventional modified Fontan procedure. The total cavopulmonary anastomosis, lateral tunnel Fontan, has been advocated as a preferred method for Fontan type repair. From 1987 to July 1990, 39 patients underwent total cavopulmonary anastomoses (group 1) and 39 patients underwent modified Fontan procedures (group 2); patients receiving adjustable atrial septal defects were excluded. Diagnoses in group 1 included tricuspid atresia in 5 patients, single ventricle in 32, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 2. Diagnoses in group 2 included tricuspid atresia in 20, single ventricle in 17, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in 1, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 1. There were no significant differences in age, weight, cross-clamp time, duration of inotropic support, postoperative effusions, or hospital stay between the two groups. Early mortality in group 1 was 7.7% (3/39) and in group 2, 2.6% (1/39). There was no difference in the incidence of early dysrhythmias or early pacemaker placement. Late mortality was 2.8% in group 1 and 8% in group 2 with a mean follow-up of 18 and 25 months, respectively. Follow-up in group 1 revealed 33 patients in normal sinus rhythm and 1 patient with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia; no additional patients have required pacemakers. Follow-up in group 2 revealed 27 patients in normal sinus rhythm and supraventricular tachycardia in 4 patients; 5 additional patients have required pacemaker placement. There is no apparent difference in early outcome between the total cavopulmonary anastomosis and the conventional modified Fontan. However, there appears to be an increased incidence of late dysrhythmias and the need for pacemaker placement in the conventional modified Fontan group compared with the lateral tunnel group. 
Is adult-onset coeliac disease due to a low-grade lymphoma of intraepithelial T lymphocytes? Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma commonly presents with malabsorption, and debate continues as to whether adult-onset coeliac disease (CD) is itself a form of low-grade lymphoma. A 59-year-old man with adult-onset CD required resection of a segment of oedematous jejunum. Histological examination of this tissue revealed an intense intraepithelial lymphocytosis. Immunophenotypic (CD3-, CD4-, CD8-, CD34-, and CD45 RO-) and cytogenetic (deletion of the Y chromosome and chromosome 9) abnormalities were found, together with monoclonal T-cell-receptor gene rearrangements. Some patients with adult-onset CD may have low-grade lymphoma from the outset of their illness. 
Treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts with octreotide. Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common and painful complication of chronic pancreatitis. Seven patients (six male, one female; mean age 49.9 years) with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts and persistent pain were treated with the pancreatic anti-secretory drug octreotide for 2 weeks. Octreotide caused no notable changes in the size of the pseudocysts of three patients. In the remaining four patients, the pseudocysts decreased in size by a mean of 42% (range 29-52%), and pain disappeared completely. These findings suggest a role for octreotide in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts. 
Intussusception in cystic fibrosis. Two cases of acute intussusception in older children with cystic fibrosis are reported. Both cases presented with symptoms and signs consistent with meconium ileus equivalent, which delayed the final diagnosis. Both cases required abdominal surgery but made full and uneventful recoveries. 
Home monitoring of transcutaneous oxygen tension in the early detection of hypoxaemia in infants and young children. Twenty three patients (age range 0.5-40 months) with recurrent cyanotic episodes underwent physiological recordings, including transcutaneous oxygen tension (TcPO2) from a monitor modified for use at home (Kontron 821S). Of 69 episodes in which the arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2, Nellcor N200) was less than or equal to 80% for greater than or equal to 20 seconds and/or central cyanosis was present, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed (less than or equal to 20 mmHg or 2.67 kPa) in every episode. The pulse oximeter identified hypoxaemia in 62 out of 69 episodes, failing in seven episodes due to signal loss from movement artefact. In only seven of 69 episodes was there an accompanying apnoeic pause (greater than or equal to 20 seconds), and heart rate fell to less than or equal to 80 beats/minute in only five of 28 episodes in which an electrocardiogram was recorded. In 32 episodes in which SaO2 fell to less than or equal to 60%, the TcPO2 monitor alarmed after a median time interval of 16 seconds (maximum time interval 30 seconds). The TcPO2 monitor was then used in an uncontrolled trial at home in 350 patients at increased risk of sudden death and/or hypoxaemia. Indications for monitoring included apparent life threatening events or cyanotic episodes (n = 163), prematurity and prematurity related disorders (n = 86), and sudden unexpected death in one or more siblings (n = 122). The TcPO2 monitor detected cyanotic episodes at home in 81 patients, 52 of whom received vigorous stimulation and/or mouth to mouth resuscitation. Twenty one of these 52 patients had further hypoxaemic episodes documented in hospital with pulse oximetry. 
How AIDS forces reappraisal of hepatitis B virus control in sub-Saharan Africa For developing countries the cost-benefit of vaccination in the control of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is great since the acute infection is generally subclinical and the benefit is the prevention of small numbers of cases of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since the pattern of HBV infection in Africa is such that, compared with south-east Asia, infection occurs later in childhood and spread is horizontal rather than vertical, investigation of the method of spread of HBV may result in a means of control other than by vaccination. In the meantime, because of the overlap in the means by which HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are spread, it could be worthwhile taking advantage of existing AIDS prevention programmes to educate people about how to avoid both HBV and HIV infections. 
Treatment of oesophageal perforation: a multivariate analysis. Perforation of the oesophagus was retrospectively analysed in 59 patients. Cause and extent of perforation, localization, quality of the oesophageal wall and therapeutic modes were subjected to univariate analysis. The perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus (39) were also subjected to multivariate analysis. Perforation of the cervical oesophagus is seldom lethal and can be adequately treated conservatively in the majority of cases. Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus can be divided into two groups, with or without simultaneous perforation of the parietal pleura. The optimal treatment for the group with pleural perforation seems to be resection of the oesophagus and secondary reconstruction, although primary closure is indicated in selected early cases. Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus confined to the mediastinum can be adequately treated conservatively in most patients. Perforation of the intra-abdominal oesophagus should be treated like any other intra-abdominal visceral perforation, by closure or diversion, even if this results in resection of the oesophagus. 
Comparison of the Finapres and direct arterial pressure monitoring during profound hypotensive anaesthesia. The Finapres was compared with direct intraarterial pressure monitoring in 10 patients undergoing local resection of choroidal melanoma, an operation that requires a period of profound hypotension. Good agreement was recorded for systolic arterial pressure and heart rate over a range of pressures. However, agreement of mean and diastolic pressures was poor, with the Finapres tending to overestimate these values. In cases requiring profound hypotension, direct arterial pressure monitoring remains the method of choice. 
The kissing balloon technique with two over-the-wire balloon catheters through a single 8-French guiding catheter. Some of the newer over-the-wire coronary angioplasty catheters have shaft sizes of 3.0 French (F) or less. The inner diameter of modern 8-F guiding catheters is large enough to accommodate two of such balloon catheters. We report a kissing balloon procedure with two over-the-wire catheters through a single 8-F guiding catheter. 
Superior vena caval thrombosis detected by transesophageal echocardiography. Three patients with clinical suspicion of bacterial endocarditis, induced by either pacemaker or indwelling catheter, underwent transesophageal echocardiography. High short-axis cuts through the great vessels, however, revealed the presence of superior vena caval thrombus in all three patients. Transesophageal echocardiography is more sensitive in establishing the diagnosis of superior vena caval thrombus than surface echocardiography. Comparison of transesophageal echocardiography with other diagnostic modalities is needed in assessing its overall sensitivity and specificity. 
Antibody to hepatitis C virus in post-transfusion hepatitis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), their relation to outcome, and the seroconversion rate in patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected serum specimens. SETTING: A referral-based university hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty-three consecutive patients who developed non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis after open-heart surgery. All patients had follow-up with serial serum testing and clinical evaluation. The mean (+/- SD) duration of follow-up after hepatitis onset was 81 +/- 33 months (range, 13 to 132 months). Seventeen patients recovered after acute-phase illness, whereas 46 developed chronic disease which, in 30 cases, was confirmed histologically. MAIN RESULTS: Of 32 patients tested before transfusion, 1 (3.1%) had anti-HCV. Fifty-nine (93%) patients were anti-HCV positive during acute-phase hepatitis: Patients with "early" seroconversion (less than 15 days after hepatitis onset) did not differ from those with "late" seroconversion (greater than 60 days after onset) in epidemiologic, clinical, and biochemical features. The rate of anti-HCV positivity during acute-phase illness was not significantly different among patients who recovered (76%) compared with those who developed chronic disease (95%). At 6 to 12 months, patients whose disease resolved had lower antibody activity than those with progressive disease. Further, during long-term follow-up (1 to 9 years), 53% of patients whose disease resolved but only 6.9% of patients who had progressive disease became anti-HCV negative. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is the major cause of post-transfusion hepatitis in Italy. The time to anti-HCV seroconversion varies widely after hepatitis onset and is not significantly associated with acute-phase features or outcome of disease. 
Effect of enalapril on survival in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fractions and congestive heart failure. The SOLVD Investigators BACKGROUND. Patients with congestive heart failure have a high mortality rate and are also hospitalized frequently. We studied the effect of an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, enalapril, on mortality and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure and ejection fractions less than or equal to 0.35. METHODS. Patients receiving conventional treatment for heart failure were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (n = 1284) or enalapril (n = 1285) at doses of 2.5 to 20 mg per day in a double-bind trial. Approximately 90 percent of the patients were in New York Heart Association functional classes II and III. The follow-up averaged 41.4 months. RESULTS. There were 510 deaths in the placebo group (39.7 percent), as compared with 452 in the enalapril group (35.2 percent) (reduction in risk, 16 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent; P = 0.0036). Although reductions in mortality were observed in several categories of cardiac deaths, the largest reduction occurred among the deaths attributed to progressive heart failure (251 in the placebo group vs. 209 in the enalapril group; reduction in risk, 22 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 6 to 35 percent). There was little apparent effect of treatment on deaths classified as due to arrhythmia without pump failure. Fewer patients died or were hospitalized for worsening heart failure (736 in the placebo group and 613 in the enalapril group; risk reduction, 26 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 18 to 34 percent; P less than 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS. The addition of enalapril to conventional therapy significantly reduced mortality and hospitalizations for heart failure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. 
Impact of diagnosis-related groups on the quality of postoperative care of patients with neck dissections. Two hundred eighty patients underwent neck dissection over a 10-year period: 138 during the 5-year period before the institution of Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) reimbursement and 142 during the 5 years after DRG regulations. A comparison of these two groups by site of tumor, stage of disease, histopathology, previous treatment, type of neck dissection, whether neck dissection was carried out alone or in combination with another procedure, presence of preexisting disease, postoperative complications, and mortality revealed no significant differences. A 35% reduction in the length of hospital stay from 16 to 10 days was identified in the post-DRG group with no detrimental effects on patient care. The variables found to have the greatest impact on length of hospital stay were the extent of operation and postoperative complications. 
The long distance effects of brain lesions: visualization of axonal pathways and their terminations in the human brain by the Nauta method. This study aims at determining the reliability and the optimal post-injury survival time for the application of the Nauta technique to the analysis of the human brain. The Nauta method reveals the degeneration not only of nerve fibers, myelinated and unmyelinated, but also of their terminations. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural observations appear to prove that the Nauta technique indeed stains axons in human autopsy material. The optimal survival time for the use of the Nauta method was found to be between nine days and five months. In cases with longer survival times--up to 20 months--the Nauta technique and a previously proposed polarizing technique (showing birefringent breakdown products of myelin) can be used as complementary methods. Applying these techniques to the human brain may help define the anatomical basis of neurological and neuropsychological symptoms important for man. 
Amino acid alterations and encephalopathy in the sepsis syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of amino acid profiles in septic encephalopathy. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTING: Medical wards and medical ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Patients with infections and normal mental status were compared with patients with septic shock and altered sensorium. INTERVENTIONS: Plasma amino acid levels and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores were determined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients with septic shock and altered sensorium had higher circulating concentrations of ammonia (425 +/- 55 vs. 127 +/- 7 mmol/L) and the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine (122 +/- 19 vs. 74 +/- 3 mmol/L) and tryptophan (97 +/- 7 vs. 32 +/- 13 mmol/L), and lower levels of the branch-chain amino acid isoleucine (48 +/- 7 vs. 68 +/- 5 mmol/L) than patients with infections and normal sensorium (p less than .05). Aromatic amino acid levels correlated with APACHE II scores (R2 = .4, p less than .001) and mortality. APACHE II scores were higher in the septic shock patients (30 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 1, p less than .001), and these patients had a higher mortality rate (71% vs. 12%, p less than .01). Patients with septic shock who died had higher levels of ammonia (524 +/- 58 vs. 227 +/- 40 mmol/L, p less than .05) and sulfur-containing amino acids (172 +/- 31 vs. 61 +/- 7 mmol/L, p less than .05) than patients who survived. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma amino acid profiles appear to be important in septic encephalopathy and the severity of septic disease. 
Clinical significance of two forms of IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus. Separation of 7-8 S and 19 S forms of serum IgM antibodies to the hepatitis delta virus by rate-zonal centrifugation was carried out on serum from 24 patients with hepatitis delta virus infection: 4 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis; 5 patients with hepatitis delta virus superinfection progressing to chronicity; and 15 patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus. The high molecular weight IgM form (19 S) was predominantly detected in acute hepatitis delta virus cases, whereas the low molecular weight (7 S) form was found in chronic hepatitis delta virus cases. The serological profile of these two forms of IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus was investigated in serial samples from five patients with acute hepatitis delta virus superinfection that evolved to chronic hepatitis delta virus. We found that, in the acute stage of the disease, the 19 S form was predominant, whereas 6 mo later a predominance of 7-8 S IgM was observed. These results suggest that IgM antibody to hepatitis delta virus antibody forms are different in acute and chronic hepatitis delta virus infection and that their detection only helps in differentiating an acute infection from a chronic infection but not a hepatitis delta virus-hepatitis B virus-HBV coinfection from hepatitis delta virus superinfection in the acute stage of the disease. 
Combined surgical and interventional radiological approach for complex benign biliary tract obstruction. In patients with complicated high benign biliary strictures surgical technique alone cannot exclude the possibility of recurrent problems, and hepatic atrophy/hypertrophy, portal hypertension and intrahepatic stones may all complicate surgical management. A multidisciplinary approach to these complex cases, which minimizes the need for repeated surgical interventions, has been pursued. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed and an extended limb of the jejunum brought to the abdominal wall to allow access for later radiological intervention. Over a 30-month period 58 biliary-enteric anastomoses for benign disease were performed. Seventeen of these 58 patients were managed using the combined approach. Ten of these 17 patients had complex postcholecystectomy strictures and seven had strictures resulting from inflammatory disease, hepatic resection or congenital problems. A new classification of results of management of bile duct strictures is proposed. Seven patients were classified as 'excellent', six 'good', two 'fair' and two 'poor'. Results were obtained at a mean follow-up of 16 months and it seems likely that in some patients major surgical reinterventions were avoided. 
Hereditary unstable DNA: a new explanation for some old genetic questions? Fragile X syndrome, associated with the fragile X chromosome, is the most common cause of familial mental retardation. The condition is characterised by a heritable DNA sequence that consists of an abnormal number of CCG repeats, and which is unstable in both mitosis and meiosis. We suggest that such heritable unstable DNA sequences could be present in other parts of the genome and that these might explain a number of genetic events that are not well understood in terms of classic genetic mechanisms. Such poorly explained observations include anticipation, incomplete penetrance, variable expression, and possibly imprinting, variegation, and multifactorial inheritance. 
Significance of elevated levels of serum creatine phosphokinase in febrile diseases: a prospective study. The incidence and significance of elevated serum levels of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) in febrile diseases were studied prospectively in all patients admitted with fever to a department of medicine during 1 year. High serum CPK levels were detected in 70 (28%) of 247 febrile patients but in only six (6%) of 105 afebrile control patients (P = .0001). Elevated CPK levels were not related to any specific diagnosis. Logistic regression analysis identified five factors that correlated both significantly and independently with elevation of CPK values: increased blood urea nitrogen level, low serum phosphate level, a stuporous or comatose state, tremor, and muscle tenderness. Myoglobinuria, detected in 14 patients, was predictive of a fatal outcome, but a high CPK level by itself was not an independent correlate of mortality. In summary, CPK elevation is not uncommon in febrile diseases, but because it does not reflect a specific etiology it does not necessarily indicate that an extensive diagnostic work-up is required. 
Asymmetrical ocular pursuit with posterior fossa tumors. We report two patients with posterior fossa neoplasms who demonstrated asymmetrically impaired horizontal ocular pursuit documented with electrooculography. One patient had impaired pursuit contralateral to a pontomedullary lesion, whereas the second patient had impaired pursuit ipsilateral to a pontocerebellar lesion. These patients demonstrate that posterior fossa lesions may impair ocular pursuit either contralaterally or ipsilaterally unlike cerebral hemispheric lesions, which impair ocular pursuit ipsilaterally or bilaterally. 
Effects of a minimally supervised exercise program for mentally retarded adults. Previous exercise studies that attempted to improve the cardiovascular fitness (CVF) of mentally retarded (MR) adults were flawed with methodological shortcomings that prevented conclusive results. At issue in these training studies were fitness test validity and reliability, exactness of duration and intensity of training, and an inordinate amount of supervision. Therefore, we sought to determine whether moderately MR adults (seven males, five females; IQ = 61 +/- 3, age = 25 +/- 3 yr) could improve their CVF through a minimally supervised 16-wk training program. Each subject repeated exercise tests twice on two different modes of exercise, the treadmill (TM) and Schwinn Air-Dyne ergometer (SAE), before training to ensure validity and reliability of initial CVF levels. Intensity and frequency of exercise were closely monitored. An observer was present during the training bouts, but, following initial instructions, no additional encouragement or instructions were given. Although the training program significantly increased peak VO2 (29.2 +/- 8 to 33.5 +/- 9 ml.kg-1.min-1) and peak ventilation (73 +/- 26 to 81 +/- 231.min-1) when assessed on the TM, significant changes in these same parameters were not seen when assessed on the SAE. The importance of these results was discussed. 
Cardiac pacemaker in high spinal cord injury. Bradycardia followed by cardiac arrest is well documented as a complication of acute injury to the cervical spinal cord. This life-threatening bradycardia is attributed to an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system resulting from dissociation of the parasympathetic from the sympathetic responses during the stage of spinal shock. A patient with a C2 complete quadriplegia secondary to birth trauma who experienced symptomatic bradycardia, continuing for 21 months after injury despite intensive medical management, is reported. Clinical improvement followed insertion of a cardiac pacemaker. Possible etiologies for the continuation of abnormal bradycardia episodes after the resolution of spinal shock are discussed. Cardiac pacemaker implantation is advocated for patients with high cervical spinal cord injuries and continuing symptomatic bradycardia not responding to medical measures. 
The risk of dying of prostate cancer in patients with clinically localized disease. From 1966 to 1979, 360 patients with clinical stages A2, B and C1 prostate cancer underwent staging pelvic lymphadenectomy, and completed a course of combined interstitial radioactive gold seeds and external beam radiotherapy. All patients had a normal serum prostatic acid phosphatase level and a bone scan negative for metastases. All patients were followed until death or for a mean of 7.3 years (range 1.2 to 18.25 years) for those alive at analysis. To determine the risk of dying of prostate cancer we reviewed the records of the 142 patients (39%) who died. At analysis 21% of the patients had died of prostate cancer and 17% of other known causes. The cause of death could not be determined in 4 patients (1%). Cardiovascular disease accounted for a fifth of all deaths. The actuarial risk of death of prostate cancer for all patients was 8 +/- 3% (+/- 2 standard errors) at 5 years and 30 +/- 7% at 10 years. The risk of death of all causes was 16 +/- 4% at 5 years and 46 +/- 7% at 10 years. An increased risk of cancer death was associated with established risk factors, including advanced local disease, poorly differentiated histology, pelvic nodal metastases and distant recurrence. We also noted a substantial risk of cancer death in patients who had local tumor recurrence. While previous studies have reported a relatively low incidence of cancer deaths (4 to 17%) in patients initially diagnosed with localized disease, our data suggest that prostate cancer is the major cause of mortality in such patients. Aggressive curative therapy, regardless of treatment modality, should be considered for localized prostate cancer in men with a life expectancy of 10 or more years. 
Self-inflicted eye injuries. Five cases of self-inflicted eye injury are described and discussed. A review of the literature shows that several psychiatric diagnoses have been assigned to people who damage their eyes. A variety of mechanisms to explain this phenomenon are described. 
Dry beriberi: unusual complication of prolonged parenteral nutrition. An adult with Crohn's disease on home total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 8 months presented with peripheral neuropathy and ataxia. The patient was found to be deficient of thiamine. A prompt symptomatic response to intravenous thiamine suggests that the patient had the chronic form of dry beriberi. To our knowledge, this variety of beriberi in a patient on TPN has not previously been reported. 
Double-blind investigation of the effects of propranolol and placebo on the pressure of esophageal varices in patients with portal hypertension. This study was aimed at investigating the effects of propranolol on esophageal variceal pressure in patients with portal hypertension. Variceal pressure was measured at endoscopy using a miniature pressure-sensitive gauge in 20 patients with portal hypertension. Measurements were obtained under baseline conditions and 20 min after double-blind administration of propranolol (0.15 mg/kg; n = 10) or an identical amount of placebo (normal saline, 0.3 ml/kg; n = 10). Under baseline conditions, variceal pressure was similar in propranolol and placebo groups (14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg vs. 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg, respectively; not significant). Placebo had no significant effect on variceal pressure (baseline = 14.9 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; placebo = 15.5 +/- 6.6 mm Hg; not significant), and values after placebo administration were closely correlated with baseline values (r = 0.98; y = 1.1 + 0.97 x; p less than 0.0001). In contrast, propranolol caused a significant decrease in the pressure of esophageal varices (from 14.1 +/- 5 mm Hg to 11.3 +/- 4.4 mm Hg; p less than 0.0002). No significant changes in the size of esophageal varices were observed after propranolol or placebo administration. This study shows (a) the endoscopic pressure-gauge technique has a low variability and may be used to assess acute drug-induced changes in variceal pressure; and (b) propranolol causes significant decreases in variceal pressure in patients with portal hypertension and esophageal varices. 
Acute polyhydramnios associated with chorioangioma. A case report. A case of acute polyhydramnios occurred at 26 weeks' gestation. Prenatal sonography demonstrated a placental chorioangioma. Acute polyhydramnios is clinically distinct from nonacute polyhydramnios and carries a high perinatal mortality rate. As in our case, fetal death often results from complications of prematurity. 
Aortic thrombosis after umbilical artery catheterization in neonates: prevalence of complications on long-term follow-up. We previously reported the early natural history of aortic thrombosis occurring after umbilical artery catheterization in 21 neonates. Ten of those neonates were reevaluated at 36-42 months of age for evidence of hypertension, renal abnormalities, and leg-growth disturbances. They were compared with an age-matched control group of seven infants. Blood pressures were greater than the 95th percentile in three infants and between the 50th and the 95th percentile in six of the 10 infants. Height was less than the fifth percentile for age in four infants with aortic thrombosis. One child had a 1.0-cm discrepancy in leg-length measurements, and seven of nine patients exhibited a 0.5-2.0 cm discrepancy between legs in either thigh or calf circumference. Sonography showed no evidence of residual clot in the aorta or renal vessels. Doppler flow was normal in all cases. Despite resolution of neonatal aortic thrombosis, complications resulting in renovascular hypertension (three of 10 patients) and leg-growth abnormalities (eight of nine) can occur. Hypertension (one of seven) and leg-growth discrepancy (four of seven) were less frequent in the 3-year follow-up of the seven matched control infants. We suggest that infants with known aortic thrombosis receive long-term follow-up to detect these potential problems. 
Light reflection rheography: an effective non-invasive technique for screening patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. Light reflection rheography is a simple non-invasive technique for assessing venous function in the leg. One hundred and twenty-four patients referred for venography with a clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis were investigated by light reflection rheography to determine the accuracy of the technique in diagnosing acute thrombosis. In half of the patients venography confirmed a deep venous thrombosis. Light reflection rheography had a sensitivity of 92 per cent and a specificity of 84 per cent in detecting acute thrombosis. The technique had a negative predictive value of 92 per cent in selecting those patients with no thrombosis. Light reflection rheography can be performed at the bedside or in the radiography department which makes it a suitable technique for screening patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis. 
Wildervanck or cervico-oculo-acoustic syndrome and MRI findings. In 1952, Wildervanck described the first case of what he styled the cervico-oculo-acoustic (COA) syndrome. This comprises Klippel Feil's (KF) anomaly (congenitally fused cervical vertebrae), congenital sensorineural deafness and Duane's retraction syndrome (deficient abduction with retraction on adduction). Since that original paper, there have been further reports describing this triad, either completely or incompletely. A further case of this syndrome is reported and the first report of MRI head scan findings in this condition is presented. In addition, the origin of mirror movements observed as part of the KF syndrome are discussed. 
Asymptomatic blastomycosis of the central nervous system with progression in patients given ketoconazole therapy: a report of two cases. Ketoconazole (KTZ) has largely replaced amphotericin B as first-line therapy for blastomycosis. However, KTZ penetrates poorly into the central nervous system (CNS), and therapeutic failure may be caused by initially unrecognized CNS infection. Two patients (22% [2/9] of all culture-proven cases of blastomycosis at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, over 15 years) developed CNS blastomycosis while receiving KTZ. Neither initially had CNS symptoms; both had cutaneous and pulmonary disease that responded to KTZ. If KTZ or other fungistatic imidazoles are to continue as primary therapy for blastomycosis, studies are needed to improve the ability to identify patients likely to experience treatment failure or develop CNS disease. Possibly all patients with disseminated blastomycosis, even those without CNS symptoms, should have lumbar puncture and computed tomography of the head before therapy. Critical evaluation of their immune function also may be required before making a therapeutic decision to use KTZ or amphotericin B. 
Treatment of rat prostatic adenocarcinoma with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA): effects on growth and morphology. Rats bearing the Dunning R3327H prostatic carcinoma were castrated and supplemented with testosterone propionate. These rats were then treated with estradiol benzoate or medroxyprogesterone acetate alone or in combination with estradiol. During the treatment period of six weeks, the growth rate of the prostatic tumors was measured. At the end of the treatment period the morphology of the tumors was also studied. It was found that medroxyprogesterone acetate is as effective as estradiol in inhibiting the growth of the Dunning prostatic carcinoma and that the combination of medroxyprogesterone acetate and estradiol was more efficient in that respect than estradiol alone. Morphometric evaluation of the tumor epithelium and stroma showed a decrement of epithelial growth in all treatment groups, while the groups treated with medroxyprogesterone acetate, both alone or in combination with estradiol, also showed an inhibited growth of the tumor stroma. It was concluded that medroxyprogesterone acetate probably has direct inhibitory effects on prostatic tumor cells in the Dunning model and that medroxyprogesterone acetate may act in an additive manner with estradiol. 
Pharmacokinetics of activated protein C in guinea pigs. Protein C is a vitamin K-dependent zymogen of the serine protease, activated protein C (APC), an important regulatory enzyme in hemostasis. In view of the potential of human APC as an anticoagulant and profibrinolytic agent, the pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution of APC were studied in guinea pigs. The plasma elimination of a trace dose of 125I-APC was biphasic following an initial rapid elimination of approximately 15% of the injected dose within 1 to 2 minutes. This rapid removal of 125I-APC from the circulation was found to be a result of an association with the liver regardless of the route of injection. Essentially identical results were obtained with active site-blocked forms of APC generated with either diisopropylfluorophosphate or D-phenylalanyl-L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone, which indicates that the active site was not essential for the liver association. Accumulation of all three forms of APC in the liver peaked at 30 minutes and then declined as increasing amounts of degraded radiolabeled material appeared in the gastrointestinal tract and urine. Removal of the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (gla) domain of diisopropylphosphoryl-APC resulted in a 50% reduction in the association with liver and an accumulation in the kidneys. Protein C and protein S were cleared from the circulation at rates approximately one-half and one-fourth, respectively, that of APC. Both in vitro and in vivo, APC was found to form complexes with protease inhibitors present in guinea pig plasma. Complex formation resulted in a more rapid disappearance of the enzymatic activity of APC than elimination of the protein moiety. These findings indicate two distinct mechanisms for the elimination of APC. One mechanism involves reaction with plasma protease inhibitors and subsequent elimination by specific hepatic receptors. The other mechanism involves the direct catabolism of APC by the liver via a pathway that is nonsaturable over a substantial dose range and independent of the active site. This pattern of elimination is distinctly different from that observed with the homologous coagulation enzymes thrombin, factor IXa, and factor Xa. 
Intracarotid chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin for malignant brain tumors. Chemotherapy for tumors of the central nervous system has a limited efficacy presumably because of restricted blood-brain barrier permeability. The advantage of regional intra-arterial administration of anticancer drugs is an increased uptake during the first passage of the drugs through tumor capillaries. Twenty patients with high-grade astrocytomas (HGA) and 28 patients with metastatic brain tumors (MBT) received intracarotid/intravertebral infusion of etoposide and cisplatin. Eight patients with HGA who underwent incomplete resection responded to chemotherapy alone. Four additional patients had complete resection of the tumor. Median survival time of the group (responders and nonresponders) has been 14 months. Twelve patients with MBT responded to chemotherapy alone (six had complete response [CR], and six had partial response [PR]) with a median survival time of 7 months. Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) appears to be effective with acceptable toxicities. Accrual of additional patients is required before a final conclusion can be reached. 
High mebendazole doses in pulmonary and hepatic hydatid disease. Thirty nine children with 71 hydatid cysts were given mebendazole orally in a dose of 100-200 mg/kg/day for 12 weeks and were followed up for a mean (SD) of 63 (24) months. Twenty children (three of them after a second course) were cured and another two avoided at least one operation. No serious side effects of the drug were observed. 
Concomitant lymphangioma and arteriovenous malformation of the orbit. An 8-year-old girl had an orbital-adnexal lymphangioma and ipsilateral orbital and middle cranial fossa arteriovenous malformations. High-resolution magnetic resonance image scanning, orbital ultrasonography, and digital subtraction angiography were used for diagnosis and preoperative assessment. Complications related to this vascular neoplasm included amblyopia, acute hemorrhage with proptosis, exposure keratitis, cosmetic deformity, and recurrent preseptal cellulitis. The girl was treated with both embolization and orbital surgery for recurrent hemorrhage and proptosis. We postulated that the coexistence of a lymphangioma and arteriovenous malformation represents an unusual and extensive maldevelopment of vascular embryogenesis. 
Importance of 6-mercaptopurine dose in lymphoblastic leukaemia. To explore the possibility that higher total dosage of 'maintenance' treatment may have contributed to the recent improvement in outlook of children in the United Kingdom with lymphoblastic leukaemia, details of the amount of 6-mercaptopurine prescribed during the first two years of treatment were studied in an unselected cohort of children diagnosed between 1973 and 1987. Eighty five patients were studied, 30 diagnosed before and 55 after 1980. The group diagnosed after 1980 showed an 18% improvement in relapse free survival at five years. Their median total dose of 6-mercaptopurine had increased by 22%, whereas according to the protocol it should have risen by an average of only 9%. After 1980 boys were prescribed significantly more 6-mercaptopurine than girls, and had fewer dose reductions because of myelosuppression. These findings support the clinical impression that after 1980 an important therapeutic difference resulting from the new United Kingdom acute lymphoblastic leukaemia protocols was an increase in the amount of 6-mercaptopurine that children actually received as a result of changes in prescribing guidelines rather than dose. They also provide further evidence that boys tolerate 6-mercaptopurine better than girls, which may be related to the still unexplained difference in prognosis between the sexes. 
The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Workshop on antihypertensive drug treatment. The benefits, costs, and choices. Implications for research. Selected portions of the workshop's closing discussion are summarized. Major ongoing clinical trials of antihypertensive drug treatment are described. Some recommendations offered by workshop participants for future research directions are summarized. 
Hypercholesterolemia: the cost of treatment in perspective. Would the money spent on treating hypercholesterolemia save more lives if spent elsewhere? How many dollars must be spent on a treatment to make one person live 1 year longer? This cost-effectiveness analysis uses the cost per year of life gained to compare a wide variety of health care interventions ranging from carcinogen research to screening tests to liver transplants. The comparison calls into question some popular trends. 
Oral ketamine. Its use for mentally retarded adults requiring day care dental treatment. Four cases of severely mentally handicapped young adults requiring day care dental treatment are reported. All had required varying degrees of restraint during previous dental treatments, which had been distressing for the patient, the relatives and the ward staff. In all cases, administration of oral ketamine 10 mg/kg, 30-60 minutes before the procedure, facilitated subsequent induction of anaesthesia. 
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: evolution, early results, and impact on nonsurgical gallstone therapies Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a surgical technique first performed in France, has gained widespread acceptance among surgeons in the United States. The abdominal cavity is inflated by carbon dioxide, a video monitor is inserted via a laparoscope placed periumbilically, and the gallbladder is freed and removed from the liver bed by using small subcostal ports for access and dissection. Intraoperative cholangiography is routinely performed, but uncertainty exists about how best to manage choledocholithiasis. Compared with traditional cholecystectomy, initial reports describing laparoscopic cholecystectomy cite shorter recovery times because no large incisions are made, thus potentially reducing the cost and morbidity of cholecystectomy. A survey of 614 early cases supports these claims, with a reported complication rate of 1.5% and quick resumption of normal activities by patients. Because of its promise for reduced morbidity, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is challenging open cholecystectomy as the therapeutic gold standard for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Thus, the standard to which the nonsurgical gallstone therapies, such as lithotripsy and contact dissolution, will be compared may shift to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. As the laparoscopic complications are similar to those of traditional cholecystectomy, such as abscesses and bile leaks, their percutaneous treatment should not change. 
Renal abscess in childhood: diagnostic and therapeutic progress. During the past decade new techniques such as computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography have been reported to have changed the diagnostic investigation and treatment of renal abscess in adults. To evaluate whether similar changes have taken place in the pediatric age group, a retrospective study of all patients seen between 1979 and 1989 was performed. Seven patients, 0.8 to 14 (mean, 9) years old, with renal abscesses in eight kidneys were identified. Ultrasound and computed tomography proved to be the most valuable diagnostic tools, revealing the diagnosis by showing a hypoechoic or hypodense mass. All patients had an initial trial of intensive antibiotic treatment, which led to resolution of the abscesses in two of the eight kidneys. In all other cases the abscesses were additionally drained, which was done surgically in two and by ultrasonography- or CT-guided percutaneous drainage in four patients. Abscess cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus (three), Escherichia coli (one) and Salmonella Group B (one) and were sterile in one case. Drainage was unsuccessful in only one patient, who subsequently underwent nephrectomy for uncontrolled infection of a diffusely damaged kidney. We conclude that the diagnosis of renal abscesses is greatly facilitated by ultrasonography and CT and that most patients can be cured without operation by antibiotics and, if necessary, by additional percutaneous drainage. 
Potassium accumulation in the globally ischemic mammalian heart. A role for the ATP-sensitive potassium channel. We investigated the contribution of opening of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel to extracellular accumulation of K+ during ischemia with the use of glibenclamide, a specific blocker of this K+ channel. To characterize the electrophysiological effects of glibenclamide during metabolic inhibition (by either application of dinitrophenol or hypoxia) we performed patch-clamp studies in isolated membrane patches of guinea pig myocytes and in intact guinea pig myocytes and studied action potential parameters in isolated superfused guinea pig papillary muscle. We studied the effect of glibenclamide on extracellular accumulation of K+ and H+ in isolated retrogradely perfused globally ischemic hearts of rat, guinea pig, and rabbit. Experimental evidence is presented that supports the conclusions that glibenclamide 1) effectively blocks open K+ATP channels, 2) reverses the dinitrophenol-induced increase of the outward current and prevents the hypoxia-induced shortening of the action potential, 3) decreases the rate of K+ accumulation during the first minutes of ischemia in stimulated hearts, an effect which was entirely absent in quiescent hearts, and 4) does not influence the rate and extent of ischemia-induced extracellular acidification. 
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and early mortality. To assess morbidity, mortality, and benefit associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastronomy (PEG), we retrospectively studied 42 patients who had had PEG. Mortality was exceptionally high during the first 60 days after PEG (43%), and then stabilized. In nearly half of the cases (20/42) the PEG tube was removed during the first 60 days because of either death or improvement. Patients with malignancy had a significantly higher morbidity and 60-day mortality than the neurologically impaired. We concluded that patients should be carefully selected for PEG because early mortality is high; a 60-day trial of soft nasogastric feedings should be considered before PEG, and could reduce by nearly half the number of patients failing to receive long-term benefit; and patients with malignancy have significantly greater morbidity and mortality after PEG and may not receive the same advantage from the procedure. 
Urologic sarcoma in adults. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center experience based on a prospective database between 1982 and 1989. Urologic sarcoma is a group of rare tumors with a generally poor prognosis. These sarcomas share prognostic characteristics with soft-tissue sarcomas arising from other sites. A staging system that incorporates tumor grade and size is valuable in identifying patients at high risk of dying of disease. Patients with sarcomas that are high-grade, greater than 5 cm in diameter, or metastatic at the time of presentation (MSKCC stages 3 and 4) have a combined 3-year relapse-free survival rate of 26%. Complete surgical resection, preferably with negative margins, still offers the best chance of cure. For reasons that are not clear, multimodality therapy in rhabdomyosarcoma is less effective in adult than in pediatric disease. Present-day chemotherapeutic regimens are ineffective in controlling disseminated sarcoma. The adoption of a uniform staging system coupled with multi-institutional collaboration may allow progress to be made in this otherwise deadly form of genitourinary cancer. 
von Willebrand factor and factor VIII in renal transplant recipients under immunosuppression with cyclosporine and steroids. Sequential measurements over 4 months in 17 patients. In 17 consecutive cadaver kidney transplant recipients treated with cyclosporine (CsA) and steroids, the median of antigenic and functional levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) and factor VIII (FVIII) before transplantation were elevated (vWF:Ag: 206%, vWF:RCof: 202%; FVIII:Ag: 248%, FVIII:C: 224%; normal values 50-150%). Sequential measurements after transplantation and during CsA treatment revealed a transient significant increase of median values with highest amounts of vWF:Ag of 362% (2 p less than 0.0001), FVIII:Ag of 398% (2 p less than 0.001) and FVIII:C of 360% (2 p less than 0.0001) (Friedman test). vWF:RCof did not show statistically significant changes. After 4 months, levels of vWF and FVIII comparable to those obtained before transplantation were observed. In univariate statistical analysis no correlation was found between vWF of FVIII on the one hand and plasma creatinine levels, CsA dose or CsA whole blood through levels on the other hand. However, multivariate statistics revealed to some extent a positive influence of CsA blood levels on vWF:Ag levels. Patients with vascular rejection or chronic CsA nephrotoxicity showed significantly lower levels of vWF:Ag as compared with patients without endothelial cell damage in the kidney (2 p less than 0.05). However, the difference in vWF:Ag levels already existed before transplantation. In contrast to recent reports, plasma vWF levels were not indicative of vascular injury in kidney graft recipients nor was the marked elevation of vWF and FVIII associated with thromboembolic complications ascribed to CsA treatment. 
The relationship between locomotor disability, autonomic dysfunction, and the integrity of the striatal dopaminergic system in patients with multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, and Parkinson's disease, studied with PET. 18F-dopa and S-11C-nomifensine (NMF) are positron emitting tracers whose caudate and putamen uptake reflects striatal dopamine storage capacity and the integrity of dopamine reuptake sites, respectively. Using these two tracers, the integrity of the presynaptic striatal dopaminergic system has been studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in 10 subjects with multiple system atrophy (MSA, Shy-Drager syndrome) who had an akinetic-rigid syndrome that was poorly responsive to L-dopa, autonomic failure, and cerebellar ataxia. PET findings for the 10 MSA patients were compared with those for 13 age-matched controls, 8 subjects with L-dopa responsive Parkinson's disease (PD), and 7 subjects with pure autonomic failure (PAF). Influx constants, Ki, reflecting specific 18F-dopa uptake into striatal tissue, were severely reduced in the putamen and caudate of the 10 MSA subjects (mean putamen Ki 0.005 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls; mean caudate Ki 0.007 min-1 MSA vs 0.013 min-1 controls). Reduction of putamen, but not caudate, 18F-dopa uptake correlated with severity and duration of locomotor disability. Eight patients with PD, and a similar degree and duration of locomotor disability to the patients with MSA, demonstrated equal impairment of mean putamen 18F-dopa uptake, but significant preservation of mean caudate function. The 7 PAF patients had normal mean levels of putamen and caudate 18F-dopa uptake, although 1 individual PAF patient had significantly impaired striatal function. The MSA and PD groups of subjects both showed significantly reduced levels of specific striatal S-11C-NMF binding, again caudate function being relatively preserved in PD. It is concluded that in both MSA and PD there is a parallel decline of striatal dopamine storage capacity and reuptake site integrity, probably reflecting a loss of nigrostriatal nerve terminals. Caudate function is relatively preserved in PD compared with MSA. The majority of PAF patients have an intact nigrostriatal dopaminergic system, suggesting that PAF is a condition distinct from PD and MSA in spite of some pathological similarities. PET is capable of detecting subclinical nigrostriatal involvement in PAF patients when this is present. 
Muscle regeneration following segmental necrosis in tenotomized muscle fibers. The aim of this study was to determine how the new myotendinous junctions were re-established at the proximal and distal ends of the soleus muscle after tenotomy. Both proximal and distal tendons of the soleus muscle in mature female rats were severed. The animals were killed and the soleus muscles were removed and prepared for light and electron microscopic examination 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 42 days after the operation. It was found that segmental fiber destruction followed by removal by macrophages occurred at the ends of the soleus muscle fibers. This resulted in the liberation and myogenic activation of satellite cells. By 3 days after tenotomy the fusion of myoblasts to form myotubes could be seen. The myotubes developed within the original basal lamina and reattached to the surviving non-necrotic segments and grew in both length and width so that by 6 weeks postoperation, normal myotendinous junctions had been reformed. This study is the first to show that re-establishment of the myotendinous junction following tenotomy is accomplished by regeneration of the necrotic ends of the tenotomized fibers. 
Composition of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries in women less than 40 years of age with fatal coronary artery disease and implications for plaque reversibility. This study analyzes the composition of atherosclerotic plaques in the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries in 8 women less than 40 years of age (mean 34) with fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) and compares these data to previous studies of 37 adults greater than 45 years of age (mean 59) with fatal CAD. Histologic sections were taken at 5-mm intervals from the entire lengths of the right, left main, left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries. With the use of a computerized morphometry system, analysis of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries showed the major component of plaque to be a combination of cellular (mean percent total plaque area = 65%, standard error = 6%) and dense (19%, standard error = 6%) fibrous tissue. Arterial segments narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area from these young women were compared with similarly narrowed arteries from 37 older patients (32 men [86%]) with fatal CAD previously reported by this laboratory, and showed significantly more cellular fibrous tissue and lipid-rich foam cells, and lesser amounts of dense fibrous and heavily calcified tissue. The large amount of lipid-containing foam cells and relative lack of acellular scar tissue in coronary plaques in these young women suggests a greater potential for reversibility of these plaques in this subset of patients with CAD. 
Orbit-related variation in spatial resolution as a source of artifactual defects in thallium-201 SPECT The cause of 180-degree diametrical artifactual defects in clinical thallium-201 SPECT imaging was investigated using phantom simulation. This artifact was observed on SPECT images acquired with a "body contour" or "peanut" orbit. It was hypothesized that this artifact was caused by differences in spatial resolution that occur when the heart-to-detector distance changes employing noncircular orbits. To test this hypothesis, a series of planar static images of a normal cylindrical phantom was obtained at varying distances from the camera detector head. From these images, tomographic acquisition files were created that simulated tomographic data acquired with circular orbits and elliptical orbits. The reconstructed phantom short-axis slices showed no artifacts for circular orbits. However, for various elliptical orbits, significant regional nonuniformity, similar to the artifacts noted in patients, was observed. The degree of nonuniformity correlated with the long-short axis ratio of elliptical orbits (r = 0.98). In addition, circular orbits with the phantom in an eccentric position resulted in similar nonuniformities. It is concluded that a noncircular tomographic orbit can create characteristic artifacts on thallium-201 SPECT images. For rotational thallium 201 SPECT, a circular orbit with the heart in the center of rotation should be employed. 
Bowel obstruction: evaluation with CT Eighty-four computed tomographic (CT) scans from patients referred for bowel obstruction between January 2, 1988, and December 31, 1989, were retrospectively evaluated. A pair of radiologists without knowledge of patient histories determined the presence or absence of bowel obstruction. Sixty-four patients ultimately proved to have intestinal obstruction, and 20 did not. Diagnosis was established by means of surgery (n = 39), barium studies (n = 17), and clinical course (n = 28). Causes of obstruction included adhesions (n = 37), metastases (n = 6), primary tumor (n = 7), Crohn disease (n = 4), hernia (n = 3), hematoma (n = 2), colonic diverticulitis (n = 2), and other (n = 3). In addition, 83 CT examinations in patients with no history or indication of intestinal obstruction were simultaneously reviewed. The overall sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 96%, and accuracy was 95%. The cause of obstruction was correctly predicted in 47 of 64 cases (73%). Intestinal obstruction was not diagnosed in any of the 83 control patients. CT is most useful in patients with a history of abdominal malignancy and in patients who have not been operated on and who have signs of infection, bowel infarction, or a palpable abdominal mass.
