5	Cellular and molecular basis of the asbestos-related diseases. Asbestosis is an inflammatory and fibrotic process of the alveolar structures mediated, at least in part, by cytokines released by "activated" alveolar macrophages. The process of phagocytosis and "activation" of alveolar macrophages is poorly understood. Are all macrophages activated or only subpopulations? Which cytokines are up-regulated? How does the local milieu modulate profibrotic and antifibrotic mediators? Is protein release accompanied by up-regulation of gene transcription? Is there an ordered sequence of cytokine activity? What roles do neutrophils and lymphocytes play? How can disease progression best be quantified absent further exposure? Answers to these questions are important to direct rational strategies at interdicting the fibrotic process. The question of cancer and asbestos is more vexing. The processes of inflammation, fibrosis, and carcinogenesis appear to be closely intertwined. For example, proto-oncogenes such as c-sis (PDGF B-chain) are up-regulated in activated alveolar macrophages from fibrotic lungs; these and possibly others may play an important role in asbestos carcinogenesis. Second, asbestos can transfect DNA into cells. Furthermore, DNA can adhere to asbestos fibers, and these fibers are capable of direct transmigration into cells. The questions of the mechanisms of cigarette smoke cocarcinogenicity and latency remain. Lastly, if the bronchial epithelium is highly metaplastic throughout from cigarette smoking, what triggers a single (or several) nidus of cells to transform into carcinoma? Malignant mesothelioma poses the most challenging questions because of association with brief asbestos exposure by history. Mesothelial cells are susceptible to minute environmental manipulations, and changes occur after exposure to all fiber types. Yet epidemiologic studies point toward long amphiboles as having greater mesothelioma risk. To test this hypothesis, experimental data must be generated differentiating tumorigenesis risk from short, chrysotile fibers that can migrate to the parietal pleura from the associations of long amphiboles persisting in lung tissue. Despite the future decreasing numbers of clinical cases of asbestos-related disease, solving the important mechanistic questions remaining will contribute significantly to our understanding of fibrosis and cancer. 
1	Cell lineage markers in human pancreatic cancer. The normal pancreas consists of three major cell types or lineages that share a common embryologic origin from pluripotent endodermal precursors. The type of cell that undergoes neoplastic transformation to form a pancreatic carcinoma is controversial and may influence the phenotype and biologic behavior of the tumor. In this study, immunohistologic techniques were used to determine the cell lineage differentiation expressed in 29 primary exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas, five metastatic exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas, and five islet cell neoplasma. Specimens of normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis were used for comparison. The cell lineage markers consisted of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against trypsin and lipase (acinar cells); secretory component, carbonic anhydrase II, and pancreatic cancer mucin SPan-1 (ductal cells); and chromogranin-A and somatostatin (islet cells). The expression of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and lysozyme were also determined. This collection of markers allowed the differentiation between acinar, ductal, and islet cells of normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis specimens. The expression of cell lineage markers in islet cell tumors was homogeneous and restricted to chromogranin-A. In contrast, the expression of these markers in primary and metastatic exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas was variable. Reactivity with monoclonal anti-CEA was absent in normal pancreas, and was present in 83% of chronic pancreatitis specimens as well as 90% of exocrine pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In addition, lysozyme reactivity was absent in normal pancreas; however, lysozyme was expressed in one case of chronic pancreatitis, 17 cases of primary carcinoma, and three cases of metastatic carcinoma. These findings support the concept that the original transformed cell type in many pancreatic exocrine carcinomas resemble endodermal "stem cells" that retain the capability of differentiation along more than one cell lineage pathway. 
1	Circulating CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for HTLV-I pX in patients with HTLV-I associated neurological disease. The human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), the first human retrovirus to be characterized, is associated with adult T-cell leukaemia and a chronic progressive disease of the central nervous system termed tropical spastic paraparesis, or HTLV-I-associated myelopathy. Only 1% of individuals infected with HTLV-I develop clinical disease however. The various manifestations of an HTLV-I infection may be related to differences in the genetic backgrounds of individuals, infection with variant strains of HTLV-I, differences in viral tropism or host immune response to the virus. Whereas the humoral response to HTLV-I is well characterized, little is known about the human cellular immune response, such as the production of cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Here we report the presence of high levels of circulating HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in patients with HTLV-I associated neurological disease but not in HTLV-I seropositive individuals without neurological involvement. These cytotoxic T lymphocytes are CD8+, HLA class I- restricted and predominantly recognize the HTLV-I gene products encoded in the regulatory region pX. These findings suggest that HTLV-I-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes may contribute to the pathogenesis of associated neurological disorders associated with HTLV-I. 
5	A new syndrome of congenital hypoparathyroidism, severe growth failure, and dysmorphic features. Twelve infants (six boys, six girls) with severe hypocalcaemic tetany or convulsions were seen over a three year period. Nine patients were symptomatic in the newborn period. Their hypocalcaemia was associated with hyperphosphataemia and very low concentrations of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone. None of the babies suffered from congenital cardiac disease. Cell mediated immunity, measured in five patients, was normal. There were no chromosomal abnormalities but all patients shared several dysmorphic features including deep set eyes, microcephaly, thin lips, beaked nose tip, external ear anomalies, micrognathia, and depressed nasal bridge. Mental retardation of varying degree was found in all patients. All had severe intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation. Four patients have died. The remaining eight patients are on treatments with vitamin D and calcium supplements with no change in their growth pattern. We believe that this association of congenital hypoparathyroidism with severe growth failure and dysmorphism represents a new syndrome. 
5	Regulatory elements of the erythropoietin gene. Because the human hepatoma cell line Hep3B produces erythropoietin (Epo) in a regulated fashion, it can be used to investigate the cis-acting regulatory elements of the Epo gene. Comparison of primate and mouse sequences shows strong homology not only in the coding sequence but also within the 5' flanking region, the first intron, and the 3' flanking region. These portions of the Epo gene were inserted 5' and 3' to a reporter gene, human growth hormone (GH). 5A is a 1,192-base pair (bp) HindIII-Xbal fragment that extends from 378 bp 5' to the cap site through the first intron. To obviate the problem of false initiation of translation from the Epo ATG start codon, this site was changed to TAG by site-directed mutagenesis. 3A is a 255-bp Accl-BglII fragment that extends 67 bp upstream from the Epo termination codon and covers most of the 3' noncoding region of homology. The plasmid DNAs were transfected by electroporation into Hep3B cells with RSVCAT as an internal standard to correct for transfection efficiency. One aliquot of cells was exposed to 50 mumol/L CoCl2 or to 1% O2. At the end of the incubations, GH and Epo were measured in the cell media and the cell pellet was assayed for CAT. Production of GH was stimulated 1.7-fold by cobalt or hypoxia. Furthermore, addition of 3A to the GH gene, irrespective of orientation, stimulated GH production 2.6-fold with CoCl2 and 2.3-fold with hypoxia. Stable cell lines were produced by cotransfection of the above constructions, along with the selectable marker pSV-Neo. In two clones, exposure to hypoxia resulted in much more marked (16-fold) induction of GH. Stimulus of both GH and Epo production by hypoxia was partially abrogated by carbon monoxide. These results demonstrate the presence of promoter and enhancer elements within the human Epo gene that are appropriately responsive to hypoxia and cobalt. 
4	Prospective study on prevalence of esophageal chest pain in patients referred on an elective basis to a cardiac unit for suspected myocardial ischemia. The prevalence of esophageal chest pain was studied prospectively in patients referred on an elective basis to a cardiac unit for suspected myocardial ischemia. A group of 248 consecutive patients without previously documented heart disease was admitted for elective diagnostic coronary angiography. The clinical history classified 185 patients as having anginal pain and the coronary angiogram was normal in 48 of them. In 37 of these 48 patients full esophageal testing was performed including 24-hr intraesophageal pH and pressure recordings with indication of chest pain episodes as well as a number of esophageal provocation tests, ie, acid perfusion, edrophonium stimulation, balloon distension, and ergonovine stimulation, all performed under continuous esophageal manometric and electrocardiographic monitoring. In 19 of these 37 patients, the familiar chest pain could be reproduced by esophageal provocative testing without ischemic ST-T segment alterations; six of these 19 patients had also a positive 24-hr pH and pressure recording. These data strongly suggest an esophageal origin of chest pain in half the patients with typical angina and a normal coronary angiogram. 
5	Therapeutic options in acute diverticulitis. Diverticulitis is a serious intra-abdominal infection that ultimately afflicts about one in four patients having colonic diverticulosis. The illness may be indolent or fulminant, depending on the degree of colonic spillage and its containment. Most patients require hospitalization, and medical therapy suffices in about three fourths. Those who fail aggressive medical management and those with recurrent acute attacks, diffuse peritonitis, abscess, persistent obstruction, or fistulization require surgical intervention. Abdominal CT scanning has supplanted the contrast enema as the acute diagnostic procedure of choice and allows guided percutaneous drainage of large abscesses in selected cases. This approach helps realize the surgical ideal of a single elective operation without a temporary colostomy. For those patients still requiring emergency surgery, the two-stage approach employing resection of the diseased colon at the initial operation is far superior to the older three-stage approach. 
3	The pathophysiology of anoxic injury in central nervous system white matter. White matter of the mammalian brain is susceptible to anoxic injury, but little is known about the pathophysiology of this process. We studied the mechanisms of anoxic injury in white matter using the isolated rat optic nerve, a typical central nervous system white-matter tract. Optic nerve function, measured as the area under the compound action potential, rapidly failed when exposed to anoxia. Postanoxic recovery was variable, depending on duration of the anoxic insult; after a standard 60-minute period of anoxia, the compound action potential recovered to 28.5% of control. Irreversible anoxic injury was critically dependent on extracellular Ca2+; maintaining the tissue in zero [Ca2+] solution throughout the anoxic period resulted in 100% compound action potential recovery. Increasing perfusate [Ca2+] during anoxia from zero to 4 mM resulted in progressively less recovery. Anoxic damage to the optic nerve appears to depend on the gradual accumulation (over tens of minutes) of Ca2+ in a cytoplasmic compartment. The inorganic Ca2+ channel blockers Mn2+ (1 mM), Co2+ (1 mM), or La3+ (0.1 mM) had no effect on recovery of the compound action potential after anoxia; only Mg2+ (10 mM) significantly improved recovery. Treatment with the dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blockers nifedipine (1-10 microM) or nimodipine (1-40 microM) also had no effect on recovery from anoxia. Thus, Ca2+ influx during anoxia does not occur via conventional Ca2+ channels. Preliminary evidence suggests that this Ca2+ influx may occur via other cation channels that are imperfectly selective for Ca2+ or via the Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger. 
3	Emergency portosystemic shunt in patients with variceal bleeding. Thirty-five patients for whom emergency sclerotherapy or conservative treatment, or both, failed to arrest variceal bleeding, or who had early rebleeding and required emergency portosystemic shunts (EPSS) were studied. EPSS permanently controlled the variceal bleeding in all but one patient. In this patient, the shunt was patent as demonstrated by angiography. Esophageal varices disappeared in 18 patients and were reduced in 14. Three patients died before the endoscopic examination could be performed. The causes of death were hepatic failure in two and bleeding ulcerations of the gastric fundus in the other patient. One patient was classified in Child's category B and two in Child's category C. Thirty-two patients submitted to EPSS and were discharged alive. Twelve of these patients subsequently died, at an average of 11.2 months after undergoing the shunt procedure. Four of 12 patients died of hepatic failure; two patients died of hepatomas; two, other neoplasia; three, hemorrhaging duodenal ulcers, and one patient, renal failure. Analysis of actuarial survival rates showed that the five year survival rate was 43 per cent. The long term survival rates were fewer for patients with Child's category C than for those with combined Child's categories A and B (five year survival rates were 21 versus 55 per cent; p less than 0.05). During the follow-up period, none of the patients had variceal bleeding. Chronic encephalopathy developed in six, which was mild in three, moderate in one instance and severe in two. It developed soon after EPSS, with onset in the first month after discharge in three. Thus, when conservative treatment fails to arrest variceal bleeding, EPSS should be performed to guarantee definitive control of hemorrhage and prolong the survival period. 
5	The efficacy of methylprednisolone in reducing flap edema. It has been suggested that systemic steroids reduce postoperative flap edema. This has been poorly documented by several reports based on subjective clinical observations. In an effort to provide quantitative data on methylprednisolone and edema, a flap edema model in the rat was developed based on the inferior epigastric vessels. Significant edema developed after 48 hours. Differing intraoperative doses of methylprednisolone were studied, producing a dose-response curve. A single low dose of intraoperative steroid is effective in reducing flap edema; previously recommended doses are probably excessive. 
2	Pneumatosis intestinalis and pneumoperitoneum complicating mixed connective tissue disease. A case of a young woman with a 3-year history of mixed connective tissue disease who developed secondary pneumatosis intestinalis and pneumoperitoneum and died shortly after of rapidly progressive disease is reported. The pathogenesis, treatment and prognosis of this unusual complication in mixed connective tissue disease are discussed. 
4	Is hyperglycemia associated with cardiovascular disease? The Framingham Study. The association of nonfasting blood glucose levels with CVD incidence was determined prospectively in 1382 men and 2094 women aged 45 to 84 years participating in the Framingham Heart Study. For this study, all patients were classified in 1970 as diabetic or nondiabetic. Every 2 years they were examined, categorized according to causal blood glucose samples obtained at the clinic visit, reclassified for development of CVD and diabetes mellitus, and followed 10 years for CVD. During the follow-up period, 350 men and 369 women developed CVD. Age-adjusted CVD rates were positively associated with glucose levels in nondiabetic women who did not develop diabetes during follow-up. No such associations were seen in men. Multivariate analyses confirmed the independent association of blood glucose levels with later CVD in nondiabetic women. This study shows that hyperglycemia in the original Framingham cohort is an independent risk factor for CVD in nondiabetic women, but not among men. 
4	Experience with photocoagulation in Behcet's disease. Between 1973 and 1987 we examined both eyes of 300 patients with the uveoretinitis-type lesions characteristic of Behcet's disease. Of the 556 eyes whose fundus could be examined, 38 eyes (6.8%) in 33 patients (11%) had developed retinal capillary nonperfusion, branch retinal vein occlusion, or retinal or disc neovascularization. These eyes were treated by photocoagulation, primarily to forestall vitreous hemorrhage and the development of neovascular glaucoma, as well as to decrease the macular edema resulting from vein occlusion. The treatment, which was well tolerated, was successful in closing retinal capillary nonperfusion areas and eliminating retinal neovascularization. Disc neovascularization was resolved completely in some cases, and partially in others. 
2	Nosocomial outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in AIDS patients. OBJECTIVE--To describe a nosocomial outbreak of cryptosporidiosis during four months after June 1989. SETTING--A department of infectious diseases in Copenhagen, seeing about half the patients with AIDS in Denmark. SUBJECTS--73 HIV antibody negative subjects and 60 antibody positive subjects admitted as inpatients during the transmission period of the outbreak (20 June-14 August), of whom 18 (17 with AIDS, one with AIDS related complex), developed cryptosporidiosis. Two further HIV negative subjects (one departmental secretary, one visiting relative) developed cryptosporidiosis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cryptosporidia in stool samples, clinical symptoms, CD4 cell count, HIV antigen concentration, chemotherapeutic treatment. RESULTS--The source of the outbreak was identified as ice from an ice machine in the ward, contaminated by an incontinent, psychotic patient with cryptosporidiosis picking out ice for cold drinks. The mean incubation time was at least 13 days-that is, twice that in HIV-negative patients. Of the 18 patients with AIDS who developed cryptosporidiosis, five recovered, two were symptomless carriers, three died of unrelated causes, and eight died after prolonged diarrhoea. Among the 57 exposed HIV antibody positive inpatients (excluding two patients and the index case with cryptosporidiosis diagnosed elsewhere), significantly more of those who developed symptomatic cryptosporidiosis received oral sulphonamides than those who did not (91%, 10/11 v 48%, 21/44, p less than 0.05). CONCLUSIONS--The clinical and epidemiological findings indicate that infection was the consequence of very small inocula. Increased sensitivity to cryptosporidiosis may be an unrecognised side effect of oral sulphonamide treatment in patients with AIDS. 
4	Management of multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease in patients with hypertension. Hypertension intervention trials, which have involved mainly the use of diuretics and beta-blockers, have demonstrated a disappointing benefit in terms of reduction of coronary heart disease (CHD). Rather than suggesting that elevated blood pressure and CHD are not causally related, these data suggest that the antihypertensive agents used were not optimal for the management of hypertension and a review of the currently recommended therapies is needed. Major risk factors for CHD, which include increased blood pressure, elevated serum cholesterol levels, and smoking, are highly prevalent in the general population and appear to cluster in patients with hypertension. Therefore the treatment of hypertension demands a multifactorial approach, one that takes into consideration all the risk factors for CHD. Diuretics and beta-blockers adversely affect the serum lipid profile, and this could negate some of the CHD benefit afforded by blood pressure reduction. 
4	Differential protective effects of halothane and isoflurane against hypoxic and reoxygenation injury in the isolated guinea pig heart. The authors investigated the effects of halothane (HAL) and isoflurane (ISO) on cardiac depression produced by global hypoxia and the recovery of function following reoxygenation is isolated guinea pig hearts perfused with Krebs' solution at constant pressure. Isovolumetric left ventricular systolic (LVSP) and end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP) were measured by placing a saline filled, latex balloon into the left ventricle. Bipolar electrodes were placed in the right atrium and right ventricle for measurements of heart rate (HR), atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT), and determination of the incidence and severity of dysrhythmias occurring during hypoxia and reoxygenation. Hearts were divided into three groups: control (n = 20), halothane (n = 12), and isoflurane (n = 13). All hearts were exposed in sequence to oxygenated perfusate (PO2, 530 mmHg), moderately hypoxic perfusate (PO2, 91 mmHg) for 30 min, and then to oxygenated perfusate for 40 min. Halothane (1%, 0.4 mM) or isoflurane (1.5%, 0.5 mM) were administered 10 min before hypoxia, during hypoxia, and during the first 10 min of reoxygenation. Exposure to halothane and isoflurane before hypoxia produced a 14 and 11% decrease in heart rate, a 32 and 23% increase in AVCT, and a 47 and 28% decrease in LVSP (all P less than or equal to 0.001) for halothane and isoflurane, respectively, and no significant change in LVEDP. During hypoxia, HR decreased and AVCT increased similarly in both groups. Left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) decreased sharply with a narrowing of the prehypoxic differences among the groups. In the control and isoflurane groups, LVEDP increased during hypoxia but remained unchanged in the halothane group. 
2	From Leningrad to the day-care center. The ubiquitous Giardia lamblia. Giardiasis is recognized as a worldwide public health problem. Seroprevalence data from both the developing and developed world show high rates of carriage in populations at risk for fecal-oral transmission, such as children in day-care centers. Outbreak investigation has expanded our understanding of reservoirs for Giardia lamblia and of the routes of transmission. Various host factors have been associated with infection. The pathogenesis of giardial infections is being elucidated, in particular the role of lectin activation in producing disease. Three standard chemotherapeutic agents are available in the United States. The institution of community-wide prevention measures is equally important. Current areas of investigation including antigenic composition and enzymatic variants should result in effective forms of immunotherapy, while more effective forms of chemoprophylaxis could assist in eradicating the pathogen from institutional settings. 
1	The value of symptom directed evaluation in the surveillance for recurrence of carcinoma of the breast. Specific postoperative tests used to diagnose recurrent carcinoma of the breast were evaluated for their ability to have an impact on the over-all course of the disease. Sixty-four patients with recurrent or new contralateral primary disease were divided into two groups based on the method of diagnosis. Those patients with a new complaint at an interval between scheduled follow-up visits and who went on to have tests to document a recurrence were categorized as interval follow-up. Those who were seen at a prearranged regular follow-up period and received tests as recommended by the attending physician or surgeon and had a documented recurrence were classified as routine follow-up. Thirteen patients presented with new contralateral primary disease and 51 with metastatic disease (16, bone; 13, lung; 11, local; three, liver, and eight, multiple). The median time to discovery of recurrence from the primary treatment was 29 and 28 months for the interval and routine groups, respectively. Ninety per cent of the failures occurred by 53 months. The survival time after recurrence was significantly greater in those patients diagnosed routinely (p = 0.003). However, the over-all survival time (from primary therapy to death) was only significantly improved for the routine group when the contralateral new primary diseases were included (p = 0.009). The method of diagnosis of a contralateral primary carcinoma was physical examination and mammogram. Strong recommendations for follow-up testing can be limited to mammogram and physical examination. 
5	Loss of photosynthetic and chlororespiratory genes from the plastid genome of a parasitic flowering plant. Photosynthesis is the hallmark of plant life and is the only plastid metabolic process known to be controlled by plastid genes. The complete loss of photosynthetic ability, however, has occurred on several independent occasions in parasitic flowering plants. Some of these plants are known to lack chlorophyll and certain photosynthetic enzymes, but it is not known to what extent changes have occurred in the genes encoding the photosynthetic apparatus or whether the plants even maintain a plastid genome. Here we report that the nonphotosynthetic root parasite Epifagus virginiana has a plastid chromosome only 71 kilobases in size, far smaller than any previously characterized land plant plastid genome. The Epifagus plastid genome has lost most, if not all, of the 30 or more chloroplast genes for photosynthesis and most of a large family of plastid genes, the ndh genes, whose products may be involved in a plastid respiratory chain. The extensive changes in Epifagus plastid gene content must have occurred in a relatively short time (5-50 x 10(6) yr), because Striga asiatica, a related photosynthetic parasite, has a typical complement of chloroplast genes for photosynthesis and chlororespiration. The plastid genome of Epifagus has retained transcribed ribosomal RNA and ribosomal protein genes, suggesting that it expresses one or more gene products for plastid functions not related to photosynthesis. 
1	Human papillomavirus in women with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia III. Untreated cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) III may progress to invasive vulvar carcinoma. Tissues from 29 New Zealand women with VIN III were examined for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18 by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction. HPV 16, the only HPV type detected in the lesions, was identified in about half the cases. HPV-positive women were younger than HPV-negative women, and their lesions displayed koilocytosis more often. In four of five cases in which there was a progression to invasive cancer, HPV 16 was detected in both the VIN III and invasive cancer tissue. 
4	Transesophageal echocardiography during percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty. To ascertain the value of transesophageal echocardiography during percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty, the present study was undertaken in 26 anesthesized patients (21 women and 5 men; mean age, 47 years) with symptomatic rheumatic mitral valve stenosis. In all but one patient the balloon dilation of the mitral valve was successful and Doppler-derived valve area increased (0.9 +/- 0.3 to 1.9 +/- 0.4 cm2). Transesophageal echocardiography provides continuous monitoring, as well as guidance of the procedure. Crossing the arterial septum, as well as delivery of the sheath through the mitral valve orifice and correct positioning of the balloon, was highly facilitated and reduced x-ray exposure time. The degree of mitral regurgitation and the presence of interatrial shunting at the end of the procedure could be readily assessed, making cineangiography not necessary. Complications of the procedure, such as pericardial effusion, could be detected before hemodynamic deterioration had occurred (one patient). The advantages of transesophageal echocardiography for routine monitoring of percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty, however, should be weighted against the added risk and expense of this support. 
5	Assessment of Proplast-Teflon disc replacements [published erratum appears in J Oral Maxillofac Surg 1991 Feb;49(2):220] This retrospective study reports the findings in the follow-up of 31 temporomandibular joints in which Proplast-Teflon (Vitek Inc, Houston, TX) replacements were used. Among the problems noted were pain, malocclusion, restricted opening, and degenerative changes in the condyle and fossa. 
3	Facial bone fracture associated with carotid-cavernous sinus fistula. Out of 989 cases of facial bone fracture, ten patients had carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas (1.01%). Their ages ranged from 25 to 48 years. Seven were male and three female. Two of the ten patients had lower third, three patients had middle third, three patients had upper third, and two patients had combined middle and lower third facial bone fractures. The signs and symptoms of a fistula appeared from the first postinjury day up to 50 days after the injury (mean, 21 days). Four patients had symptoms after operation for facial bone fracture. Most fistulae were identified by arteriography before treatment. Followup ranged from 1 year, 8 months, to 5 years, 9 months (mean, 2 years, 9 months). One patient had a malocclusion. Nine patients had complete resolution of their bruits. Complications included unilateral complete visual loss (two), CSF rhinorrhea (two), and stroke in one of the two CSF rhinorrhea patients. One patient expired due to a severe head injury, and there was one death from an unrelated cause. 
1	Retinal vasculitis as a complication of rheumatoid arthritis. Two middle-aged women developed retinal vasculitis in the moderately active phase of classical rheumatoid arthritis. Fluorescein angiography disclosed diffuse leakage from the retinal capillaries and cystoid macular edema, which subsided in response to oral steroid. They did not show any clinical signs of vasculitis in other parts of the body. Retinal vasculitis should be included in the list of complications observed in rheumatoid arthritis. 
1	Astroblastoma: electron microscopy and immunohistochemical findings: case report. The clinical, histological, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic features of a cerebral astroblastoma are reported. The patient is a young woman with a superficial parietal tumor. Macroscopic findings include a well-delineated superficial nodule with a hard central core. Histological study disclosed a predominantly papillary tumor with hyalinized vessels. Tumor cells were scarcely positive with immunohistochemical stain for glial fibrillary acidic protein, extensive and diffusely positive with vimentin and neuron-specific enolase, and intensely positive with S-100 and epithelial membrane antigen in the papillary areas. Ultrastructural study showed abundant intermediate filaments forming bundles in tumoral cytoplasms, membrane junctions, and external laminae when cells were in contact with collagen fibers. Based on immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics, we believe that the filaments seen in tumor cells are mainly vimentin filaments. These peculiar immunohistochemical patterns in a glioma may aid in the histological diagnosis of this rare tumor type. 
4	Relative importance of activation sequence compared to atrioventricular synchrony in left ventricular function. This study evaluated the relative hemodynamic importance of a normal left ventricular (LV) activation sequence compared to atrioventricular (AV) synchrony with respect to systolic and diastolic function. Twelve patients with intact AV conduction and AV sequential pacemakers underwent radionuclide studies at rest and Doppler echocardiographic studies at rest and during submaximal exercise, comparing atrial demand pacing (AAI) to sequential AV sensing pacing (DDD) and ventricular demand pacing (VVI). Studies at rest were performed at a constant heart rate between pacing modes, and the exercise study was performed at a constant heart rate and work load. Cardiac output was higher during AAI than during both DDD and VVI (6.2 +/- 1 vs 5.6 +/- 1 and 5.3 +/- 1 liters/min, p less than 0.05). LV ejection fraction was likewise higher during AAI (55 +/- 12 vs 49 +/- 11 vs 51 +/- 13, p less than 0.05). VVI with or without AV synchrony was associated with a paradoxical septal motion pattern, resulting in a 25% impairment of regional septal ejection fraction. In addition, LV contraction duration was more homogenous during AAI. Peak filling rate during AAI and VVI was higher than during DDD (2.86 +/- 1 and 2.95 +/- 1 vs 2.25 +/- 1 end-diastolic volume/s; p less than 0.05). During VVI, the time to peak filling was significantly shorter than during both AAI and DDD (165 +/- 34 vs 239 +/- 99 and 224 +/- 99 ms; p less than 0.05). 
1	Improved early detection of recurrence in prostatic carcinoma following hormonal therapy. Combined use of palpation and fine needle aspiration cytology. Fifty-nine hormonally treated prostatic carcinoma patients were prospectively followed by rectal examination and fine needle aspiration cytology at six-month intervals for periods ranging from six to one hundred twenty months (median follow-up 48 mos). The cytologic findings and clinical impressions were divided into four or five categories, respectively, ranging from benign to clearly malignant. Cytologic material and clinical descriptions suitable for evaluation were available for 306 follow-up examinations. Of these, 209 were cytologically benign (including 191 without and 18 with clinical evidence of malignancy). The remaining 97 examinations showed cytologic evidence of malignancy of which 50 were clinically apparent (51.5%). While the correlation of clinical and cytologic findings was good (91.4%) in cases with no evidence of disease activity, our findings indicate that many recurrences which are occult to clinical examination may be detected by cytologic examination. 
1	Chromosomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: karyotypic patterns in disease subtypes. To define further the clinical importance of cytogenetic analysis in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) a prospective study was performed on 139 unselected children. Analyses were considered adequate in 104, of whom 35 were normal and 69 had clonal abnormalities. Abnormalities were categorised according to banded chromosome analysis as well as chromosome count. Karyotypes were correlated with clinical and laboratory features at diagnosis and with survival. Of the successful analyses, thirty five (34%) children had no abnormalities; this group contained an excess of T cell disease. Twenty five (24%) had a "characteristic" hyperdiploid karyotype and as a group had lower presenting white counts, a tendency to CD10, and periodic acid schiff positivity of the blast cells and smaller spleens. None was an infant and only one was over 10 years old. Seven (7%) children with t(9; 22), t(8; 14), or t(4; 11) translocations were grouped together as "specific" translocations. Collectively they had a significantly worse prognosis than the remainder. Nine children developed central nervous system relapse, six of whom had either t(4; 11) or abnormalities of 9p or 19p. A descriptive classification taking into account chromosome bonding pattern is cytogenetically more appropriate and may be more clinically useful than grouping children simply by chromosome number. As knowledge and techniques improve, the classification of cytogenetic abnormalities in ALL will need to be kept under frequent review. 
5	Acute upper airway obstruction following Teflon injection of a vocal cord; the value of nebulized adrenaline and a helium/oxygen mixture in its management A 67-year-old man presented with a 45-year history of a week voice. This was result of polio which had left him with a right vocal cord palsy. The patient underwent a Teflon injection of the right vocal cord under general anaesthesia to improve the quality of his voice. In the immediate post-operative period, he suffered acute upper airway obstruction. The problem of acute upper airway obstruction following Teflon injection is considered and its management with nebulized adrenaline and a helium/oxygen mixture is discussed. 
5	Assessment of patient laboratory data in the acutely ill. Laboratory test results are a valuable source of information. Nurses need to assess laboratory test results as part of the physical assessment of their patients. Comparison of laboratory test results and changes with abnormal physical findings provides the basis for changes in the nursing care plan. Progressive monitoring of laboratory results and prompt interventions might lessen the seriousness of the health problem. In acute care units, the initial group of laboratory tests serves as a baseline for assessing additional test results. Several reference values should be remembered, particularly the electrolytes (potassium, sodium, and calcium), glucose, BUN, creatinine, and albumin. Specific group profiles assist in identifying and in monitoring the patient's health status. Incorporating laboratory test results into the plan and evaluation of care will result in safer and more effective patient care. Referring to laboratory test findings and comparing them with physical assessment findings are required for the delivery of professional nursing care. 
3	Fluctuations of interictal brain imaging in repeated 123I-IMP SPECT scans in an epileptic patient. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) brain scans with N-isopropyl-(iodine 123) p-iodoamphetamine (123I-IMP) were performed three times in interictal periods in a 35-year-old man with intractable frontal lobe epilepsy and normal X-ray CT findings. The first scan showed decreased 123I-IMP uptake in the right frontal lobe. This abnormal image was regarded as the primary focus of his epilepsy on the basis of its regional agreement with focal epileptic discharges on EEGs. In the second scan, he showed normal imaging, while the third scan showed the same abnormal image as before, in the right frontal lobe. The frequency of his clinical seizures was almost unchanged during the intervals between scans and further EEGs recorded soon after each scan showed almost no changes in the basic activities and frequency of the epileptic discharges. Such fluctuations in SPECT brain imaging suggest that the severity of functional inactivation underlying the focal hypoperfusion image as an epileptic focus may fluctuate considerably in the interictal state with no relation to the clinical features of epilepsy. 
5	Incidental demonstration of pericardial fistula during hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Biliary vomiting developed 16 mo after resection of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in a patient with a complex postoperative course. A biliary scan revealed an outline of the pericardium, suggesting a fistula. The potential role of radionuclide imaging in this rare and potentially fatal complication is discussed. 
3	The efficacy of suction drains after routine total joint arthroplasty [published erratum appears in J Bone Joint Surg [Am] 1991 Jun;73(5):791] A prospective study of thirty-eight patients (seventy-six knees) who had had a primary bilateral total knee replacement and twelve patients (twenty-four hips) who had had a primary bilateral total hip replacement was conducted to assess the effect of postoperative suction drainage on wound-healing. A suction drain was placed on each patient's right operative wound, while no drains were used on the left. Otherwise, the same operative technique and method of closure were used in all wounds. Statistical analysis of the results showed no difference between the two sides with regard to the incidences of swelling or persistent drainage. Return of active function of the quadriceps and of range of motion of the knee in patients who had had a total knee replacement was also unaffected by the use of suction drains. We concluded that the routine use of suction drains for wounds is unnecessary after uncomplicated total joint arthroplasty. 
5	Congenital angiotropic lymphoma (intravascular lymphomatosis) of the T-cell type. The autopsy of a stillborn infant showed an extensive intravascular proliferation of atypical cells throughout the body. There was no infiltration by these cells of the parenchyma of the bone marrow, lymph nodes, or thymus. By histochemistry, these cells were negative for naphthol-ASD-chloroacetate esterase, a marker of granulocytes. By immunohistochemistry, they were reactive with MT-1 and anti-Leu-22, but unreactive with MB-1, L26, anti-Leu-M1, Tu-9, and antihemoglobin antibodies. A few cells reacted with antileukocyte common antigen and UCHL-1. Based on these findings, the lesion was diagnosed as angiotropic lymphoma (intravascular lymphomatosis) of the T-cell type, which occurred congenitally. Most angiotropic lymphomas in the literature are of the B-cell type, and no leukemia virus type I antibody was negative in the mother. 
1	Thyroid carcinoma with mixed tall-cell and columnar-cell features. Tall-cell and columnar-cell carcinomas have been regarded as aggressive variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma. In the present case report the authors describe a composite tumor where these forms of differentiation coexisted, with transitional changes occurring within single follicular structures. This finding indicates that the two variants are closely related. In local recurrences, one or the other feature appeared in separate lesions. Lung metastases developed, and the patient died 5 1/2 years after diagnosis and primary treatment. 
2	The auditory P300 event-related potential: an objective marker of the encephalopathy of chronic liver disease. Recently many variants of electroencephalogram-evoked responses have been studied as potential diagnostic aids in the detection and evaluation of hepatic encephalopathy. This study assesses the value of the auditory P300 event-related potential--a slow component of the auditory evoked response--as a tool in this field. Twenty-one nonencephalopathic and 12 encephalopathic (grade 1/2) cirrhotic patients and 26 controls were assessed clinically and psychometrically. Electroencephalogram spectral analysis and visual evoked response recordings were also conducted. An auditory P300 wave was elicited using the standard two-tone discrimination paradigm. The latency and amplitude of this wave were measured. The latency of the P300 was found to be significantly increased in the encephalopathic patients compared with both nonencephalopathic cirrhotic and control groups (p less than 0.05). Amplitude of the wave was decreased in both nonencephalopathic and encephalopathic patients, but this was not statistically significant. This study suggests that the latency of the P300 is a good marker of grades 1 and 2 clinical hepatic encephalopathy. The delays in the P300 latency may indicate that encephalopathic patients have a deterioration of their stimulus evaluation abilities. 
5	Subtle cerebellar phenotype in mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the En-2 homeobox. The two mouse genes, En-1 and En-2, that are homologs of the Drosophila segmentation gene engrailed, show overlapping spatially restricted patterns of expression in the neural tube during embryogenesis, suggestive of a role in regional specification. Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation that deletes the homeobox were viable and showed no obvious defects in embryonic development. This may be due to functional redundancy of En-2 and the related En-1 gene product during embryogenesis. Consistent with this hypothesis, the mutant mice showed abnormal foliation in the adult cerebellum, where En-2, and not En-1, is normally expressed. 
5	Analysis of programmed stimulation methods in the evaluation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients 20 years old and younger. The purpose of this study was to systematically evaluate programmed ventricular stimulation in patients less than 21 years of age undergoing electrophysiologic testing. A standardized protocol was applied in 55 consecutive patients (mean age 14 years) with the following clinical presentations: sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 17); ventricular fibrillation (VF) (n = 7); syncope with heart disease (n = 10); nonsustained VT (n = 6); and syncope with an ostensibly normal heart (n = 15). The stimulation protocol consisted of 1 and 2 ventricular extrastimuli during sinus rhythm, followed by 1 to 4 (S2, S3, S4, S5) extrastimuli during pacing at 2 ventricular sites. Of the 17 patients with sustained VT, 12 had induction of the arrhythmia (sensitivity = 71%). Overall, 18 of 55 patients had inducible sustained VT, with this response significantly enhanced by use of S4 or S5 protocols (p = 0.02). Although no syncope patients with an ostensibly normal heart had inducible sustained VT, 7 had polymorphic nonsustained VT in response to ventricular stimulation. The mean number of extra-stimuli preceding the induction of nonsustained or sustained VT or VF did not differ. The induction of VF in 5 cases during this study was preceded in each case by extrastimuli intervals less than or equal to 190 ms. Thus, data indicate that aggressive stimulation protocols appear to be required for induction of sustained VT in most young patients, nonsustained polymorphic VT as a response to aggressive programmed stimulation is of uncertain significance, and that coupling intervals less than or equal to 190 ms may correlate with the induction of VF. 
1	Radiobiological studies in the naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome. The naevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is described in a 43-year-old male. The response of dividing fibroblasts from this patient to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation was indistinguishable from that of a normal control: mean inactivation dose (D) = 1.74 Gy and 1.68 Gy, respectively. However, these cells were defective in the repair of potentially lethal damage (D = 2.36 Gy and 3.26 Gy, respectively). The response to radiation of Go T lymphocytes derived from the patient was similar to that of the control. The frequency of mutant circulating T lymphocytes resistant to 6-thioguanine was 17 x 10(-6) which was elevated when compared with age-matched controls. These results suggest an abnormality in the response of the fibroblasts to ionizing radiation damage. 
5	Use of recombinant human erythropoietin to enhance autologous blood donation in a patient with multiple red cell allo-antibodies and the anemia of chronic disease. We treated a patient with alcohol-induced cirrhosis, intractable pain from a defective hip prosthesis, and multiple red cell allo-antibodies with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) in order to facilitate collection of blood for autologous transfusion during an elective total hip revision. This patient had experienced a delayed transfusion reaction 4 months earlier after receiving least incompatible packed red cells for gastrointestinal bleeding. His blood could not be crossmatched because of the development of multiple antibodies to homologous blood given during previous surgery and several episodes of gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Following initiation of EPO therapy, there was a prompt and persistent increase in the reticulocyte count from a baseline of 1.6% to a maximum of 8.6%. This was accompanied by maintenance of the hematocrit between 32% and 38.5% despite withdrawal of seven units of autologous blood over the 45-day treatment period. Poor venous access and availability of blood bank personnel, not hematocrit level, were the limiting factors that determined how frequently blood could be collected. We conclude that EPO stimulated erythropoiesis in this patient with underlying anemia of chronic disease and facilitated harvest of autologous blood for elective surgery. 
1	Breast cancer screening in older women: practices and barriers reported by primary care physicians. Annual mammography, in combination with clinical breast examinations, can reduce mortality from breast cancer. However, surveys of both patients and physicians suggest that mammography is underutilized. This study examined whether physicians' reported breast cancer screening practices and barriers to mammography varied with patients' age. Data from 576 primary care physicians (internal medicine, family/general practice, and obstetrics/gynecology) who participated in a mailed statewide survey were analyzed. Physicians reported screening elderly women significantly less often than younger women, regardless of family history of breast cancer. With the exception of medical specialty, physicians' demographic and practice characteristics were not associated with reported screening practices. However, physicians' knowledge and beliefs about breast cancer in older women were associated with reported screening practices. When analyzing barriers to ordering mammography, cost to the patient was viewed as a barrier for women of all ages, and pain was viewed as a greater barrier for younger women; otherwise, physicians consistently believed that their elderly patients faced considerably more barriers compared with younger women. Further investigation is required to examine why primary care physicians report age-related differences in both breast screening and barriers to mammography. 
3	Observation of cerebrospinal fluid flow with echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging. Using echo-planar (EP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow patterns have been demonstrated in the normal subject and patients with pathological conditions including communicating hydrocephalus, aqueduct stenosis and syringohydromyelia. Snap-shot imaging times of 128 ms allow detailed demonstration of transient intraventricular CSF flow patterns, which is not possible with conventional MRI. The potential of EPI as a method for qualitative and quantitative assessment of CSF dynamics is illustrated. 
5	Pneumatic chest wall compression. A cause of respiratory failure from massive subcutaneous emphysema. Subcutaneous emphysema rarely causes significant adverse clinical consequences. Two patients had development of massive subcutaneous emphysema during positive-pressure ventilation that resulted in chest wall compression and respiratory failure. Drainage of the subcutaneous air produced dramatic improvement. Subcutaneous emphysema is potentially fatal in ventilated patients. Specific decompression of subcutaneous tissues is indicated in such extreme cases. 
1	Factors related to and consequences of weight loss in patients with stomach cancer. The Norwegian Multicenter experience. Norwegian Stomach Cancer Trial. Of 1165 patients with stomach cancer included in a national, prospective multicenter study with 51 surgical units participating, information about weight loss before diagnosis was available for 855 patients (73%). Median weight loss was 5 kg; 259 patients (31%) experienced no weight loss. By logistic regression analysis the authors found that weight loss increased with age and advancing stages of disease (TNM Stage I-IV), with decreasing Karnofsky index, in Lauren's diffuse versus intestinal tumor type, and with tumors located at the cardia/esophagus. Increasing weight loss reduced the resectability rate significantly, but no association between weight loss and postoperative complication rate was found. The odds ratio for postoperative mortality was 2.5 to 1 for the weight loss group 5 to 10kg versus 0 kg. In conclusion, weight loss reflects a less favorable tumor status. Weight loss did not increase postoperative morbidity but did lead Weight to a higher death rate after surgery. 
4	Sudden appearance of coronary thrombus observed by angiography--a case report. A sudden coronary thrombus formation was documented by chance during cardiac catheterization in a patient with postinfarction angina. The thrombus was successfully treated with intravenous urokinase and heparin infusions, and thereafter, coronary angioplasty was performed without any complication. 
5	Surgical treatment for severe slipping of the upper femoral epiphysis. We have used a modified technique of cervical osteotomy to treat a consecutive series of 23 patients with chronic slip of the upper femoral epiphysis. It has been successful in correcting both moderate and severe deformities with a low incidence of avascular necrosis, comparable to that seen after subtrochanteric osteotomies. We describe the operative details and discuss the features which make cervical osteotomy technically superior to intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric procedures. 
1	Synthesis of type I collagen in healing wounds in humans. To quantify wound healing in surgical patients, samples of wound fluid were collected through a silicone rubber tube for 7 postoperative days and their concentrations of the carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) and the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) were measured with specific radioimmunoassays. The mean concentration of PICP in would fluid on day 1 was 207 +/- 92 (SD) micrograms/L, and on day 2 908 +/- 469 micrograms/L (p less than 0.001, signed rank test). On day 7, the mean concentration reached was 380 times higher than that of day 1 (79,330 +/- 54,151 micrograms/L). Only one peak of PICP antigenicity, corresponding to the intact propeptide as set free during synthesis of type I procollagen, was detected on Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration analysis of wound fluid samples. The mean concentration of PIIINP was 70 +/- 61 micrograms/L on day 1, 86 +/- 88 micrograms/L on day 2, and 180 +/- 129 micrograms/L on day 3 (p less than 0.001 when compared with day 1). Finally on day 7, a 250-fold concentration (17,812 +/- 9839 micrograms/L), compared with day 1, was reached. Methods described in the present paper allow separate and repetitive quantification of the synthesis of both type I and type III procollagen during human wound healing. 
2	Vaccines and milk immunoglobulin concentrates for prevention of infectious diarrhea. Considerable progress has been made in the last decade in developing vaccines against the most important enteric infections. Two new, widely licensed vaccines (oral Ty21a and parenteral Vi) are available against typhoid fever, and new attenuated Salmonella typhi strains are ready for testing. An engineered live orally administered cholera vaccine, CVD 103-HgR, is undergoing clinical trials for safety, immunogenicity, and transmissibility in children in areas where cholera is endemic. Multiple candidate vaccines against rotavirus, Shigella, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are in clinical trials. Newly acquired knowledge about pathogenesis and mucosal and cellular immunology, coupled with application of biotechnology, has already resulted in many candidates for vaccines, and more are expected to appear within the next few years. 
5	Porokeratoses: immunohistochemical, light and electron microscopic evaluation. Punch biopsy specimens of 14 patients with porokeratosis of Mibelli (n = 1), disseminated superficial porokeratosis (n = 6), disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (n = 4), porokeratosis plantaris, palmaris et disseminata (n = 2), and punctate porokeratosis (n = 1) were obtained for light and electron microscopy for evaluation of possible differences between these clinical variants. Langerhans cells in close contact with early degenerating keratinocytes could be observed in the epidermis. To study the cellular composition of the epidermal inflammatory infiltrate immunohistochemistry was performed. These studies demonstrated that the predominant cell type in these infiltrates are helper T cells, intermingled with Leu-6+ Langerhans cells. Despite the clinical variation and possible different etiologic or triggering mechanisms, the immunohistochemical and morphologic changes in all types of porokeratosis are the same and seem to represent a uniform reaction pattern. 
5	Is thioridazine retinopathy progressive? Relationship of pigmentary changes to visual function. Thioridazine toxicity has been described as a 'progressive chorioretinopathy', but this designation can be misleading. During the first year after thioridazine exposure retinal pigmentation evolves from a granular to a patchy or nummular appearance. However, visual function and the electroretinogram typically improve during this period. Some cases may show chorioretinal atrophy and functional loss many years later, but there is little evidence for ongoing drug-related progression. Late atrophy may represent degeneration of cells that were injured subclinically at the time of initial drug exposure. Although thioridazine toxicity produces an evolving pigmentary disturbance, functional changes must be monitored independently of fundus appearance. 
5	Role of percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsy in suspected intrathoracic malignancy. Percutaneous fine-needle aspiration (PFNA) biopsy is an accepted technique for the diagnosis of suspected intrathoracic malignancy, but the appropriate indications for its use have not been clearly defined. To help establish guidelines, we performed a retrospective analysis of 188 patients who underwent PFNA biopsy for suspected intrathoracic malignancy. Biopsy led to a diagnosis in 72% (135/188) of the patients, but in 27% (50/188) samples were inadequate for cytological diagnosis, and in 2% (3/188) samples were adequate but failed to yield a diagnosis. Fifty-three patients underwent surgical intervention, thus allowing histological confirmation of the cytological diagnosis. In patients with a diagnosis from PFNA biopsy, operation confirmed malignancy in 97% (37/38) and a specific cell type in 79% (30/38). In patients without a diagnosis after biopsy, a malignancy was found in 73% (11/15) at the time of operation. This suggests a high rate of accuracy when PFNA biopsy provides a diagnosis. However, it also illustrates that a substantial percentage of PFNA biopsy attempts fail to yield a diagnosis in patients ultimately found to have malignancies. This implies that PFNA biopsy might best be reserved for patients who are not surgical candidates. 
5	Cesarean section before the onset of labor and subsequent motor function in infants with meningomyelocele diagnosed antenatally Background. Meningomyelocele can now be detected before birth. Few data are available on its natural history, however, and optimal management at the time of delivery is controversial, although it has been suggested that labor and vaginal delivery may cause pressure on exposed nerve roots, resulting in additional loss of neural function. Methods. To assess the effect of labor and the type of delivery on the level of motor function in fetuses with uncomplicated meningomyelocele, we identified 200 cases of this disorder, accounting for 95 percent of the cases that occurred in the state of Washington during our 10-year study period. We compared the outcomes of 47 infants delivered by cesarean section before labor began, 35 delivered by cesarean section after a period of labor, and 78 who were delivered vaginally (another 40 were ineligible for the study). In cases of meningomyelocele detected prenatally, cesarean section was performed before the onset of labor if isolated meningomyelocele without severe hydrocephalus was present. The infants delivered in this manner were compared with those who were delivered either vaginally or by cesarean section after labor began. Results. At two years of age, the infants who had been exposed to labor were 2.2 times more likely to have severe paralysis than those delivered by cesarean section without labor (95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 2.8). Infants delivered by cesarean section before the beginning of labor had a mean (+/- SD) level of paralysis 3.3 +/- 3.0 segments below the anatomical level of the spinal lesion at two years of age, as compared with 1.1 +/- 2.3 for infants delivered vaginally and 0.9 +/- 4.1 for infants delivered by cesarean section after the beginning of labor (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). Exposure to labor did not affect the frequency of neonatal complications or later intellectual performance. Conclusions. For the fetus with uncomplicated meningomyelocele, delivery by cesarean section before the onset of labor may result in better subsequent motor function than vaginal delivery or delivery by cesarean section after a period of labor. 
5	Beagle pup germinal matrix maturation studies. Intraventricular hemorrhage, or hemorrhage into the germinal matrix tissues of the developing brain, remains a common problem of preterm infants. The "risk period" for this insult is the first 3-4 postnatal days. We hypothesized that this risk period for hemorrhage is related to rapid perinatal maturation of the germinal matrix vasculature and employed the newborn beagle pup model for the study of this maturation. Newborn beagle pups (n = 30) were anesthetized and systemically perfused with buffered formalin; the brains were removed and prepared for immunohistochemical study. Sections stained with Bandeiraea lectin demonstrated that there was no difference in germinal matrix vessel density between postnatal days 1 and 4. Germinal matrix sections were also stained for antibodies to alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV, collagen V, desmin, factor VIII-related antigen, fibronectin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, laminin, transferrin, and vimentin. Vasculature staining by alpha-smooth muscle actin was not noted until postnatal day 10, and differential staining was detected for antibodies to laminin and collagen V. Quantification of staining intensity by confocal microscopy demonstrated a significant increase in both extracellular matrix components at postnatal day 4 compared with day 1 (p less than 0.05 for both). These basement membrane proteins may add sufficient structural integrity to germinal matrix vessels to prevent capillary rupture and thus intraventricular hemorrhage. 
5	Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis: volumetric measurement of nasogastric aspirate to determine the imaging modality The authors postulated that volumetric measurement of residual gastric aspirate in neonates and infants with nonbilious projectile vomiting could enable differentiation between patients with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) and those with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) and help to determine whether ultrasound (US) or fluoroscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract would best confirm the diagnosis. In the 38 patients (all but two of whom had been fasting for 3-4 hours), 10 mL or more of nasogastric aspirate was considered indicative of obstruction. HPS occurred in 91.7% of patients with 10 mL of aspirate or more, whereas GER occurred in 85.7% of patients with less than 10 mL. The differences between the two groups were statistically significant. Solely on the basis of residual volume (greater than or equal to 10 mL), the cause of vomiting could be differentiated, prior to standard radiologic studies, 89.4% of the time. It is concluded that patients with projectile vomiting who have 10 mL or more of residual aspirate in the stomach should undergo US for confirmation of HPS; those with less than 10 mL should undergo fluoroscopy for confirmation of GER. 
4	Financial impact of a rapid CK-MB-specific immunoassay on the diagnosis of myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was twofold. First, we evaluated the financial impact of a rapid, monoclonal antibody-based CK-MB mass assay (Stratus, Dade Division, Baxter Laboratories, Miami, Fla) for the direct measurement of CK-MB in serum samples from 65 patients admitted to the coronary care unit with the possible diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Second, we evaluated retrospectively the Stratus assay and an activity assay (electrophoresis) for CK-MB in the following patient categories: acute myocardial infarction treated with and without thrombolytic therapy, angina, congestive heart failure, skeletal muscle trauma, and the acutely ill without acute myocardial infarction. The advantageous features of the Stratus mass assay were as follows. First, the laboratory was able to perform the assay more frequently because of the short assay time per specimen (less than 10 minutes) without additional personnel. This had a substantial impact on the clinician's ability to diagnose acute myocardial infarction and to move patients out of an intensive care unit at substantial financial savings to the patient, the hospital, or the third-party payer. Second, the Stratus assay was able to detect low levels of CK-MB (1 to 2 micrograms/L) in the presence of low total creatine kinase activity (less than 100 U/L). Third, the Stratus assay showed no interference due to very-high-total creatine kinase activities (greater than 100,000 U/L), CK-BB, macro-creatine kinase, and mitochondrial creatine kinase. 
2	Diarrhea in ciguatera fish poisoning: preliminary evaluation of pathophysiological mechanisms. Ciguatera fish poisoning is a clinical syndrome consisting of a combination of gastrointestinal and neurological symptoms occurring after eating toxin-containing tropical reef fish; it is a major cause of morbidity in Hawaii, the South Pacific, Australia, and the Caribbean. In an effort to define pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for the diarrheal component of the illness, we examined the effect of crude and fractionated toxin preparations on isolated rabbit ileal tissue in a Ussing chamber model. Both the crude toxin preparation (prepared from toxic Ctenochaetus strigosus) and 10% and 50% methanol-chloroform toxin fraction (prepared from a pool of toxic fish samples) gave a striking increase in transepithelial electrical potential difference and short-circuit current. Enterotoxic activity seemed to be mediated by calcium. When examined by light microscopy, the intestinal mucosa was not damaged by the toxin preparations used. Our data demonstrate that toxins involved in ciguatera fish poisoning directly stimulate intestinal fluid secretion without accompanying tissue damage and suggest that calcium is the "second messenger" mediating the process. 
5	Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of streptokinase lysis of thrombosed right-sided St. Jude Medical valves in patients with congenital heart defects. Four episodes of St. Jude Medical prosthesis leaflet thrombosis were serially evaluated by two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography during treatment with streptokinase. Three patients aged 4, 11, and 24 years with congenital heart disease had St. Jude Medical valves in pulmonary positions (two cases) for tetralogy of Fallot and in the tricuspid position (one case). The duration of thrombosis was not known in any patient. Leaflet immobility and its resolution were demonstrated by echocardiography and were confirmed fluoroscopically. Continuous wave Doppler echocardiography showed abnormal stenotic gradients in thrombosed valves that were reduced after thrombolysis. These studies demonstrate the utility of two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography in serial evaluation of prosthetic pulmonary and tricuspid valve thrombosis during thrombolysis. 
1	Unusual variants of adrenal pseudocysts with intracystic fat, myelolipomatous metaplasia, and metastatic carcinoma. Five previously unreported cases of adrenal pseudocysts are described that demonstrate a wider range of histologic appearances than has been previously recognized in these lesions. One pseudocyst removed from an asymptomatic 59-year-old female contained intracystic nests of cytologically malignant cells of unknown origin. Workup revealed a left breast mass, which on biopsy showed an infiltrating ductal carcinoma with neoplastic cells that were cytologically similar to those found within the cyst contents. Four other pseudocysts are described with variable numbers of intracystic vascular structures and benign adrenal cortical cells. In addition, intracystic mature adipose tissue was observed in all four cases, with myelolipomatous metaplasia found in one. Awareness of the wide histologic variability of these lesions should improve diagnostic accuracy and allow distinction from adrenocortical neoplasia and myelolipoma. 
1	Late metastases of cutaneous melanoma: case report and literature review. The development of delayed metastases, although rare, is well documented in patients with invasive cutaneous melanoma. Only 24 cases, including ours, are clearly documented in the literature. We describe a 56-year-old woman who had an acral lentiginous melanoma of the right hand (thickness 1.2 mm). Thirteen years after excision and postoperative irradiation, a subcutaneous metastasis developed in the right arm. One year later the patient died with disseminated bone metastases. This case, as with most of those with delayed metastases, has typical features: female sex; location at a site other than the back, arm, neck, or scalp; and primary tumor thickness between 1.2 and 2.5 mm. 
4	Reappraisal of surgical treatment of traumatic transection of the thoracic aorta. Since Crawford's report in 1973, repair of traumatic transection of the thoracic aorta without shunt or bypass has emerged as a popular technique which simplifies the operation and avoids use of heparin. Growing evidence, however, indicates that the incidence of paraplegia is higher with this method and may outweigh its advantages. With this in mind, we have examined our experience with 40 patients who underwent repair of aortic transection from 1975-1988. The operated patients in our series all survived. Fourteen were repaired using some type of bypass or shunt, none of whom developed paraplegia. The remaining 26 patients were repaired without a shunt and 9 (34.6%) developed paraplegia or paraparesis (p less than 0.02). Paraplegia was related to aortic occlusion time (p less than 0.002). It did not occur in 11 patients with times less than 27 minutes, but happened in 2 of 8 patients with times between 28 and 35 minutes and in all 7 patients with clamp times over 35 minutes. These data suggest that shunt or bypass should be used in most cases of aortic transection. 
1	Cathepsins D and E in normal, metaplastic, dysplastic, and carcinomatous gastric tissue: an immunohistochemical study. Immunohistochemical distributions of cathepsins D and E were determined in normal mucosa, metaplastic, dysplastic, and cancerous lesions of the human stomach. Cathepsins D and E were localised in the foveolar epithelium and parietal cells of the normal gastric mucosa, but their intracytoplasmic distributions were different - cathepsin E distribution was even and diffuse in the cytoplasm while cathepsin D was found in coarse intracytoplasmic granules. Chronic inflammation and ulcer did not influence the distribution of these enzymes. No positive staining was obtained in the incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and well differentiated adenocarcinoma. Tumour cells of signet ring cell carcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells, however, gave strong and diffuse stainings for cathepsins D and E in the cytoplasm. The results suggest that the distribution of cathepsins D and E is related to each specialised function of the foveolar epithelium and the parietal cells, and that their disappearance is associated with development of well differentiated adenocarcinoma from intestinal metaplasia. 
5	Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm complicating mitral valve replacement in a 4-year-old child with acute bacterial endocarditis. A 4-year-old child with acute bacterial endocarditis required mitral valve replacement. A left ventricular pseudoaneurysm developed following surgery. The etiology and diagnosis of this complication are discussed. 
4	Transoesophageal pacing for perioperative control of neonatal paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The perioperative management of a 16-day-old infant with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is discussed. Vagal manoeuvres and medication were not adequate in controlling the SVT. Since the patient was scheduled for extensive surgery in the prone position, it was decided to use transoesophageal pacing as the method of choice for conversion of SVT. Transoesophageal pacing succeeded several times in overriding the SVT and restoring normal heart rate and haemodynamic variables. The advantages and disadvantages of various methods of treating SVT in the newborn are discussed. 
5	Postangiographic femoral artery injuries: nonsurgical repair with US-guided compression Ultrasound-guided compression repair (UGCR) of catheterization-related femoral artery injuries was evaluated as a possible new imaging-guided interventional procedure. Thirty-nine femoral artery injuries (35 pseudoaneurysms, four arteriovenous fistulas) were detected with color Doppler flow imaging in patients with enlarging groin hematomas and/or groin bruits 6 hours to 14 days after catheterization procedures. UGCR was not performed in 10 patients due to spontaneous thrombosis (n = 4), infection (n = 1) or skin ischemia (n = 1), unsuitable anatomy (n = 3), or excessive discomfort (n = 1). The remaining 29 patients underwent a full trial of compression therapy, and the lesion was eliminated in 27. Follow-up color flow scans were obtained after 24-72 hours in all 27 successful cases and at 1-15 months in 19; no recurrences or complications occurred. UGCR for acute injuries is safe and technically simple and is promising as a cost-effective, first-line treatment for uncomplicated catheterization-related femoral artery injuries. UGCR is probably not appropriate for long-standing injuries. 
5	Postarthroscopy analgesia with bupivacaine. A prospective, randomized, blinded evaluation. The analgesic effect of intraarticular bupivacaine injected at the conclusion of knee arthroscopy done under general anesthesia was investigated in a prospective, randomized, and blinded fashion. Pain scores, the use of analgesic medications, crutch use, weight-bearing, activity level, and difficulty sleeping the night after surgery were all unaffected by the use of bupivacaine. The apparent lack of effect is most likely due to rapid clearance from the knee, leaving only a transient, 1 to 2 hours of potential benefit. In this study, the patients were already quite comfortable during this time period due to the routine use of intraoperative narcotics. The preoperative level of knee discomfort was found to be a major determinant of postoperative discomfort. Other much less important factors were synovial and chondral shaving, sex of the patient, and experience of the surgeon. 
1	The intraoperative incidence of detectable bilateral and multicentric disease in papillary cancer of the thyroid. This is a prospective study to determine the incidence of grossly detectable multicentric and bilateral cancer at operation in patients who, before surgery, were believed to have a unilateral lesion. The opposite lobe was inspected at the time of operation and the surgeon made a determination as to whether there was bilateral and/or multicentric disease present. A total thyroidectomy was then carried out and the accuracy of the surgeon's judgment was established by permanent-section pathologic examination. Fifteen of the 44 patients were assessed to have gross bilateral disease. Thirteen of these were confirmed by pathologic examination. One case of microscopic bilateral disease was not recognized by the surgeon. Seventeen patients were thought to have unilateral multicentric disease. Fifteen of these cases were confirmed by microscopy and an additional seven cases were documented to have secondary foci. It is obvious from this study that most disease that is called microscopic disease is actually palpable. A review of the literature confirms this. It was very unlikely for a patient who did not have unilateral multicentric disease to have a contralateral focus of carcinoma. The incidence of bilateral disease was 32%, and the incidence of multicentric disease was 50%; the surgeon was very accurate in assessing this. We believe that surgeons who advocate lobectomy as the primary treatment for thyroid cancer are recognizing grossly detectable disease in a significant number of patients and thus are doing total thyroidectomies in most patients with bilateral disease. 
5	Circus movement atrial flutter in the canine sterile pericarditis model. Differential effects of procainamide on the components of the reentrant pathway. To evaluate the mechanisms of action of procainamide on the components of the reentrant pathway, drug-induced changes in activation patterns, effective refractory periods (ERPs), and stimulation thresholds were analyzed in nine dogs with sterile pericarditis and sustained atrial flutter. Activation maps were based on 127 close bipolar recordings from a special "jacket" electrode. From the control map, 22 +/- 2 sites covering the slow zone and the normal zone of the reentrant circuit were selected to measure ERPs and thresholds. The excitable gap was estimated from the longest ERP during pacing at the tachycardia cycle length. During atrial flutter, epicardial activation proceeded as a single wave around an arc of functional conduction block in the proximity of the atrioventricular (AV) ring or around a combined functional/anatomic obstacle, with the arc being contiguous with one of the venae cavae. An area of slow conduction, which accounted for 53 +/- 15% of the revolution time within 35 +/- 15% of the total length of the reentrant pathway, was bordered by the arc of block and the AV ring or a caval vein and the AV ring, respectively. Procainamide (5-10 mg/kg i.v.) prolonged the cycle length of atrial flutter from 144 +/- 17 to 190 +/- 24 msec (p less than 0.05) and then terminated the arrhythmia in all studies. The increase in cycle length was due to an increase in conduction time in the slow zone by 37 +/- 11 msec (86 +/- 17% of the total cycle length increase). During the last reentrant beat, conduction failed in the slow zone, with the arc of block joining the AV ring. At termination, procainamide had prolonged conduction time, stimulation threshold, and ERP in the normal zone by 11 +/- 18%, 40 +/- 80%, and 5 +/- 15%, respectively, compared with 51 +/- 16%, 86 +/- 93%, and 14 +/- 21%, respectively, in the slow zone (p less than 0.05 for all three parameters). The duration of the excitable gap did not change significantly. We conclude that procainamide preferentially affected the slow zone of single loop reentrant circuits. The drug terminated circus movement atrial flutter without abolishing the excitable gap, and its effect on conduction seemed the major determinant of the antiarrhythmic action. 
5	Enlarged adenoid and adenoidectomy in adults: endoscopic approach and histopathological study. Adenoid enlargement is uncommon in adults and because examination of the nasopharynx by indirect posterior rhinoscopy is inadequate, many cases of enlarged adenoid in adults are misdiagnosed and accordingly maltreated. This study was conducted on 35 cases of enlarged adenoid aged between 20 and 42 years. The nasal endoscope was utilized to identify the adenoid mass. Adenoidectomy under transnasal endoscopic control was performed and all the excised material was sent for histopathological examination. Adenoidectomy resulted in marked improvement in 94 per cent of cases without major complications. Histopathological examination revealed non-specific inflammatory reaction in 15 cases (43 per cent), pure reactive changes, predominantly follicular hyperplasia, in two cases (6 per cent) and mixed pattern in 18 cases (51 per cent). Endoscopic follow-up for an average 17 months identified recurrence in only two patients. It was concluded that enlarged adenoid tissue in adults has some histopathological differences from that in children and adenoidectomy under transnasal endoscopic control is safe and reliable. 
4	Therapeutic embolization: enhanced radiolabeled monitoring. Radiolabeling of Ivalon (polyvinyl alcohol sponge) particles permits localization of injected particles during embolization through the use of a portable gamma camera and provides a means to prevent potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary embolization. A more efficient technique of labeling Ivalon particles with technetium-99m sulfur colloid was developed. An increase in labeling efficiency allowed more accurate determination of the distribution of injected Ivalon particles. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated the stability of the Ivalon particles during this new labeling process. Two patients with arteriovenous malformations underwent therapeutic embolization with radiolabeled Ivalon particles; gamma camera imaging of the lesion and chest was performed throughout the procedure. 
5	Lipolytic factors associated with murine and human cancer cachexia. We have identified a lipolytic factor in extracts of a cachexia-inducing murine carcinoma (MAC16) that shows characteristics of an acidic peptide and appears to be composed of three fractions of apparent molecular weights corresponding to 3 kd, 1.5 kd, and 0.7 kd, as determined by exclusion chromatography. Material with identical chromatographic and molecular weight characteristics was also present in the serum of patients with clinical cancer cachexia but absent from normal serum, even under conditions of starvation. The MAC16 lipid factor, when injected into animals bearing the non-cachexia-inducing tumor MAC13, was capable of inducing weight loss without a significant reduction in food intake. Similar lipolytic material, although in lower concentration, was also found in the MAC13 tumor extracts. These findings suggest that cachexia may arise from the enhanced expression of a lipolytic factor associated with tumor cells. 
4	Role of beta-adrenergic blockers after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) cannot currently be prevented. Different medical regimens have been largely unsuccessful. Experimental studies suggest roles for beta-adrenergic blockers and calcium antagonists. Controlled clinical studies have failed to show any decrease in restenosis rate for calcium antagonists. Corresponding studies for beta blockers are lacking. This study evaluates 541 consecutive PTCA procedures, 455 (86%) in patients treated with beta blockers after PTCA (76% metoprolol, 14% atenolol, 4% sotalol, 6% others) and 86 (14%) in patients without beta blockers. Angiographic success was achieved in 483 of 620 lesions (78%), and was not significantly different with or without beta blockers (79 vs 73%, p greater than 0.05). The procedure success rate and the complication rates (myocardial infarction, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting, death) did not differ with or without beta blockers (p greater than 0.05). Follow-up angiograms for 426 of the 483 successfully dilated lesions (88%) revealed that a total of 155 stenoses had recurred (36%). The restenosis rate was not significantly different with (368) or without (58) beta blockers (36 vs 38%, p greater than 0.05). For beta blockers with calcium antagonists (84% nifedipine, 13% diltiazem, 2% verapamil, 1% others), the restenosis rate was 97 of 250 (39%) vs 36 of 118 (31%) (p greater than 0.05). This retrospective study indicates that treatment with beta-adrenergic blockers after PTCA, alone or in combination with calcium antagonists, does not influence either the success rate or the restenosis rate and can be continued if indicated from an antiischemic viewpoint. 
2	Gender differences in Manning criteria in the irritable bowel syndrome. The objective of this study was to determine if gender differences exist when using the Manning criteria for diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome. In an outpatient setting, 61 women and 36 men with entry complaints of abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, or both underwent full evaluation by board-certified/eligible gastroenterologists who also systematically rated the presence or absence of the six Manning criteria. Irritable bowel syndrome was defined as the absence of an organic disease explanation for the entry complaints. This determination was made by two other board-certified gastroenterologists after patients had been in the study for 9 months. These raters were independent of the study and rated the transcripts of patients' clinic visits, all other available clinical data from this and other clinics, all laboratory data obtained during the 9-month study period, and the results of a 9-month telephone follow-up to patients and their physicians. Sixty-five percent of the study population had no organic disease explanation for the entry symptoms, thereby representing irritable bowel syndrome for this study. A similar proportion and type of organic disease and irritable bowel syndrome were experienced by men and women. For the total sample of 97 subjects, the correlation of the Manning criteria with irritable bowel syndrome was 0.22 (P less than 0.01). In the 61 women, correlation between the Manning criteria and irritable bowel syndrome was significant (r = 0.47; P less than 0.01). In the 36 men, however, the correlation was in the opposite direction, although it was not significant (r = -0.16). It was concluded that significant gender differences exist when using the Manning criteria for the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and that the Manning criteria were not of diagnostic value in men. 
1	De novo carcinoma of the lower urinary tract in renal allograft recipients. Immunocompetence has been postulated as an important defense against the progression of urothelial carcinoma. Three cases of de novo lower urinary tract carcinoma in renal transplant recipients demonstrated the potential for unusually rapid urothelial extension and invasion in chronically immunosuppressed patients. Two patients had a history of perineal condyloma acuminata; tumors from 1 of these harbored the genetic sequences of human papillomavirus type 6. One patient had multiple manifestations of cyclophosphamide-related urothelial injury, including bladder carcinoma. Treatment of 2 patients culminated in a radical operation during which the remaining native urinary system was resected completely, with sacrifice of the allograft kidney in 1 and diversion into an ileal conduit in 1. The remaining patient underwent urethrectomy and partial cystectomy with a sigmoid conduit. 
3	Clinicopathological experience with pineocytomas: report of five surgically treated cases. The clinicopathological experience associated with five cases of pineocytoma is presented. All patients were treated by surgical removal without postoperative radiotherapy. In three individuals, 2000 cGy was administered to the tumor as a presurgical diagnostic test, with no evidence of response. All cases demonstrated histological features of pineocytoma, according to the criteria of Borit et al., and of the so-called "pineocytoma with neuronal differentiation," according to the criteria of Rubinstein. The experience obtained from the present series reveals that these tumors can occur in the initial decades of life, that a cystic appearance and the presence of calcifications are distinctive features of their radiological evaluation, and that they have a good prognosis after surgical removal, even when the histological data indicate local invasion. The convenience of reserving the term "pineocytoma" for these tumors, and of including the so-called "pineocytomas without further differentiation" within the group of pineoblastomas, is suggested in order to achieve a practical clinicopathological assessment of parenchymatous pineal tumors. 
4	Orthostatic hypotension in human immunodeficiency virus infection may be the result of generalized autonomic nervous system dysfunction. We used an autonomic nervous system (ANS) testing battery to determine if generalized ANS dysfunction was present in five human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) patients presenting with severe orthostatic hypotension (OH). All five patients had abnormal ANS testing, which demonstrated both sympathetic and parasympathetic defects, i.e., generalized ANS dysfunction. Treatment with fludrocortisone effectively reversed the OH in four of the five patients. The OH was transient in these four patients. We believe it is important to recognize that OH may be the result of generalized ANS dysfunction in HIV-positive patients and that it can be effectively treated. 
1	Immunocytochemical localization of progesterone receptors in endocrine cells of the human pancreas. Progesterone receptors (PgR) have been immunocytochemically localized in the nuclei of several (40% to 75%) endocrine cells of the human pancreas and in a more variable number of neoplastic cells of 7 of 18 endocrine pancreatic tumors. Conversely the exocrine epithelial cells of the pancreas did not exhibit any PgR immunoreactivity in normal as well as in different pathologic conditions, including pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Estrogen receptors were not detected in any of the pancreatic samples investigated. Double immunocytochemical experiments have documented that PgR immunoreactivity in normal Langerhans islets is a consistent feature of most (75%) glucagon-producing A cells, of approximately 5% to 20% of insulin-producing B cells, and of a variable percentage of pancreatic polypeptide (PP)-producing cells, ranging from 5% to 70%. These figures were not affected by the sex, age, or underlying disease of the patients. The reported findings corroborate previous clinical and experimental evidence indicating that sex steroid hormones may have some regulatory effects on the functional activity of the endocrine pancreas. 
1	Prostate tumour markers and differentiation grade in prostatic cancer. Serum acid phosphatase activity, prostate specific phosphatase and prostate specific antigen were measured in 100 patients with prostatic cancer. The patients were divided according to the differentiation grade into 3 groups: G1 (well), G2 (moderately) and G3 (poorly differentiated) carcinoma. Bone metastases were identified by scintigraphy. Among the 76 M0 patients the mean levels of all 3 markers were slightly higher in patients with moderately differentiated prostatic carcinoma. Among the 24 M1 patients the primary tumour was either G2 (18 patients) or G3 (6 patients); none had G1 lesions. Significantly higher serum ACP and PAP levels were found in patients with G2 tumours than in those with G3 lesions. It was concluded that the histological differentiation grade of prostatic carcinoma did affect serum levels of prostatic tumour markers; the tendency towards higher levels in the G2 group was noticeable in both non-metastatic and metastatic cases despite the limited number of patients in the latter category. In clinical practice this information may be an important additional tool in staging prostatic cancer. 
4	Effect of subarachnoid hemorrhage on serotonin uptake and release in the rabbit basilar artery. This study analyzes the changes induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) uptake and release evoked in rabbit basilar arteries by tyramine. Rabbits were injected with 5 ml of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna to produce SAH. Tritium accumulation in basilar arteries was measured after 30 minutes of incubation with 10(-7) M [3H]5-HT and a subsequent 120-minute superfusion (1 ml/min) period. The uptake of 5-HT by arteries 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after SAH was found to be 109%, 69%, 57% (P less than 0.05), and 67% (P less than 0.05) (n = 4, 4, 9, and 6; P less than 0.05) of control (n = 13; 16.8 +/- 1.2 X 10(2) dpm/mg tissue), respectively. The neuronal (cocaine-sensitive) uptake of 5-HT in the arteries 3 days after SAH decreased to approximately 38% of control, whereas the extraneuronal (cocaine-insensitive) uptake of both groups had almost the same absolute value (n = 6 and 6; 4.4 +/- 0.4 and 4.8 +/- 0.4 X 10(2) dpm/mg). Autoradiographic study disclosed that dense clusters of silver grains in the adventitia were not observed after treatment with cocaine (3 X 10(-5) M), although a diffuse distribution of grains was present throughout the vascular wall. The labeled arteries were stimulated by superfusion of tyramine, which is known to replace amines in the sympathetic nerve ending. Tyramine (10(-6) and 10(-4) M)-induced 3H efflux was significantly potentiated by SAH (n = 6) and was suppressed by treatment with cocaine. 
3	Reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome: consensus report of an ad hoc committee of the American Association for Hand Surgery on the definition of reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome. This report proposes that reflex sympathetic dystrophy be defined as a pain syndrome in which the pain is accompanied by loss of function and evidence of autonomic dysfunction. In the clinical setting, this diagnosis is usually associated with other anatomic and psychological diagnoses and may be associated with a variety of systemic illnesses and medicolegal factors. All components should be assessed before a treatment plan is established. Priorities should go to emergency care, acute injuries, and systemic illness, psychiatric problems, and chronic anatomic problems, in that order. Early, accurate diagnosis improves prognosis. 
5	Coronary angioplasty of diffuse coronary artery disease. From January 1983 through December 1987, 98 patients underwent angioplasty of at least one diffusely diseased coronary artery. Diffuse coronary disease was described as: group I, narrowing greater than or equal to 50% that involved the entire vessel (40 patients), group II, long lesions greater than or equal to 2 cm in length (39 patients), group III, three or more lesions in the same vessel (19 patients). There were 65 men and 33 women, with a mean age of 60 years; 64 patients (65%) had unstable angina, 23 patients (23%) were diabetic, 31 (32%) had prior myocardial infarctions, and 12 had prior bypass surgery. Multivessel disease was present in 89% of patients. Angioplasty of only the diffusely diseased vessel was performed in 41 patients, and additional vessels were dilated in 57 patients. Overall, of 396 lesions (four per patient) and 197 vessels (two per patient) attempted, success was achieved in 382 lesions (96%) and 187 vessels (95%); angiographic success was achieved in 112 of 120 diffusely diseased vessels (93%). Clinical success was achieved in 91 patients (93%). The overall complication rate (death, myocardial infarction, urgent bypass surgery) was 8% (8 of 98): six patients (6%) had myocardial infarction (one Q wave, five non-Q wave), one patient (1%) had urgent bypass surgery, and two patients (2%) died (one during bypass surgery). The majority of complications (7 of 8 or 87%), including the two deaths, occurred in group I patients, with a 17.5% rate, versus 2.5% in group II and 0% in group III, p less than 0.002. 
3	Resolution of the adult respiratory distress syndrome following colectomy and liver transplantation. A 32-year-old woman with liver failure from end-stage cirrhosis and ulcerative colitis developed septicemia and severe ARDS. Subtotal colectomy and a successful liver transplantation resulted in complete resolution of the ARDS. 
3	Volume conduction of the parietal N20 potential to the prerolandic frontal area. Somatosensory evoked potentials were recorded from the frontal and parietal areas in patients with various lesions in the central nervous system on stimulation of the median nerve. Five representative cases who showed a selective loss of the positive potential from the frontal area are reported. In each case, the parietal N20 potential was relatively well preserved, and the midposition between the frontal and central areas (FC area) showed a negative potential following P14. The peak of this negative potential was synchronous with that of the parietal N20 potential. This negativity on the FC area is considered to be a volume conducted potential from the parietal N20 to the prerolandic frontal area. Such an anterior volume conduction of the parietal N20 would not be explained by the concept of a tangentially oriented dipole generated in the posterior bank of the central sulcus. Instead, for the generator of the parietal N20 potential, a radically oriented dipole generated mainly in the parietal area is postulated. 
1	Granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma. Their distinction with the use of immunohistochemical methods. Granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated prostate carcinoma can mimic each other both clinically and histologically. To develop criteria useful in resolving problem cases, the authors compared the reactivities of these conditions (nine cases of granulomatous prostatitis and six cases of poorly differentiated carcinoma) with a panel of antibodies to cytokeratin (AE1/3), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP), lysozyme, antimacrophage M, and leukocyte common antigen (LCA). In granulomatous prostatitis, histiocytes were not immunoreactive for PAP, PSA, or cytokeratin; however, histiocytes reacted to lysozyme in nine of nine cases, antimacrophage M in seven of nine cases, and LCA in one of nine cases. Tumor cells from all six carcinoma cases reacted with PAP, PSA, and cytokeratin; all failed to react with lysozyme, LCA, and antimacrophage M. The authors conclude that granulomatous prostatitis and poorly differentiated carcinoma can be reliably distinguished with immunohistochemical methods. 
5	Hepatic portal venous gas identified by computed tomography in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma: a case report. An abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan in a middle-aged man injured in a high-speed motor vehicle accident demonstrated the presence of portal venous gas. Findings on initial peritoneal lavage were entirely negative. Exploratory celiotomy performed because of increasing abdominal pain and leukocytosis revealed gangrene of the cecum. This report illustrates the importance of the finding of portal venous gas on CT scan in patients with blunt abdominal trauma. 
5	Erythropoietin response to anemia as a function of age. The erythropoietin (EPO) response to anemia was assessed for 244 subjects aged 1-64 years (mean 45.2 years) and 121 subjects aged 65-94 years (mean 68.3 years). Subjects included non-anemic individuals as well as those with anemia of various etiologies, excluding renal disease and pregnancy. Significant inverse correlations between serum immunoreactive EPO and hematocrit were noted for both groups. Regression lines failed to show a significantly lower slope or y-intercept for older compared to younger subjects. EPO levels were not significantly lower for older compared to younger subjects when controlled for hematocrit level. These results suggest that the EPO response to anemia in older subjects is similar to that of younger subjects. 
4	Renovascular hypertension. Difficulties in diagnosis and treatment. Renovascular hypertension is not easily identified clinically, and most tests are not totally reliable in detecting its presence. The condition may be due to fibromuscular dysplasia or congenital anomalies in patients younger than age 30 or to atherosclerosis in patients older than 50. The goal of treatment is to lower blood pressure and improve or maintain renal function. Cure or improvement of hypertension is more likely in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia than in those with atherosclerosis. Interventional procedures include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, surgical revascularization, and nephrectomy. 
1	Enhanced antitumor reactivity of tumor-sensitized T cells by interferon alfa. Tumor-draining lymph node cells from mice bearing the methylcholanthrene-induced MCA 106 tumors can be sensitized in vitro to acquire antitumor reactivity. We examined the effect of interferon alfa on the function of cells that underwent in vitro sensitization in adoptive immunotherapy. Interferon alfa increased the antitumor reactivity of in vitro sensitized cells in the treatment of MCA 106 pulmonary metastases. This effect was evident in irradiated mice, indicating that a host response to the interferon alfa was not required. Interferon alfa treatment increased class I major histocompatibility complex antigen expression on tumor cells and increased their susceptibility to lysis by in vitro sensitized cells. These results suggest that interferon alfa enhancement of adoptive immunotherapy was mediated by its effect on tumor cells. Interferon alfa may be a useful adjunct to the adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer. 
1	A community study of delay in presenting with signs of melanoma to medical practitioners. In the absence of more effective treatment for advanced tumors, early diagnosis and treatment of localized tumors is the most effective way of reducing the burden of illness associated with melanoma. This study examined the following factors: prevalence of signs of melanoma (a mole changing in size, shape, appearance, or color, itching or tingling, bleeding or weeping, becoming raised) in 1344 individuals in a randomly selected sample of 1075 households; the length of delay in seeking medical advice; the factors associated with either going to a medical practitioner or not going/delaying; and the actions of the medical practitioners when first presented with these signs. The results indicate that a large proportion of the sample (11.9%, n = 156) had observed signs of melanoma in the previous 12 months. Of the sample reporting signs that had first appeared in the previous 5 years, only 32% sought medical advice about the signs within the recommended period. Of the sample either not seeking advice at all or delaying, 49% reported that they thought the sign "wasn't serious/would clear up." Furthermore, 30% of the sample either did not known or underrated the importance of early detection and treatment of lesions. These results indicate that there is a deficit in the knowledge of the general public about the signs of melanoma, the severity of the disease, and the possible risks associated with delay. 
1	Adenocarcinoma of the colon occurring with intussusception in an adolescent. Hydrostatic reduction of intussusception is definitive therapy in most infants with this abnormality. In the older child, adolescent, and adult, a polyp or tumor is often present. Operative intervention should be considered earlier in the clinical course both to relieve the intussusception and to define the nature of the lead point. 
5	Influence of high-dose aprotinin treatment on blood loss and coagulation patterns in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization. Intraoperative administration of the proteinase inhibitor aprotinin causes reduction in blood loss and homologous blood requirement in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. To ascertain the blood-saving effect of aprotinin and to obtain further information about the mode of action, 40 patients undergoing primary myocardial revascularization were randomly assigned to receive either aprotinin or placebo treatment. Aprotinin was given as a bolus of 2 x 10(6) kallikrein inactivator units (KIU) before surgery followed by a continuous infusion of 5 x 10(5) KIU/h during surgery. Additionally, 2 x 10(6) KIU were added to the pump prime. Strict criteria were used to obtain a homogeneous patient selection. Total blood loss was reduced from 1,431 +/- 760 ml in the control group to 738 +/- 411 ml in the aprotinin group (P less than 0.05) and the homologous blood requirement from 838 +/- 963 ml to 163 +/- 308 ml (P less than 0.05). In the control group, 2.3 +/- 2.2 U of homologous blood or blood products were given, and in the aprotinin group, 0.63 +/- 0.96 U were given (P less than 0.05). Twenty-five percent of patients in the control group and 63% in the aprotinin group did not receive banked blood or homologous blood products. The activated clotting time as an indicator of inhibition of the contact phase of coagulation was significantly increased before heparinization in the aprotinin group (141 +/- 13 s vs. 122 +/- 25 s) and remained significantly increased until heparin was neutralized after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). 
4	High-dose epinephrine improves outcome from pediatric cardiac arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Animal studies suggest that the standard dose of epinephrine (SDE) for treatment of cardiac arrest in human beings may be too low. We compared the outcome after SDE with that after high-dose epinephrine (HDE) in children with refractory cardiac arrest. DESIGN: Prospective intervention versus historic control groups. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Two similar groups of 20 consecutive patients each (median ages, 2.5 and 3 years) with witnessed cardiac arrest who remained in arrest after at least two SDEs (0.01 mg/kg). INTERVENTIONS: Treatment with an additional SDE versus HDE (0.2 mg/kg). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The rates of return of spontaneous circulation and long-term survival were compared. Fourteen of the HDE group (70%) had return of spontaneous circulation, whereas none of the SDE group did (P less than .001). Eight children survived to discharge after HDE, and three were neurologically intact at follow-up. No significant toxicity from HDE was observed. CONCLUSION: HDE provided a higher return of spontaneous circulation rate and a better long-term outcome than SDE in our series of pediatric cardiac arrest. HDE may warrant incorporation into standard resuscitation protocols at an early enough point to prevent irreversible brain injury. 
1	Intralaryngotracheal thyroid. A case of intralaryngotracheal thyroid in a 57-year-old man is presented. The treatment modalities are considered and the previous literature is reviewed. 
4	Spinal cord compression from a thoracic paraganglioma: case report. A 34-year-old man with a 4-month history of midthoracic back pain sought treatment for a recent onset of lower extremity paresthesia and stiffness. A myelogram and computed tomographic myelogram disclosed an extradural block at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebral body with involvement of the pedicles, lamina, and spinous process. A posterior decompression of the spinal cord with subtotal resection of a highly vascular tumor was performed. The tumor was identified as a paraganglioma. In a second stage, the remainder of the tumor was embolized preoperatively, and gross total excision and sequential stabilization of the spine with a Luque rectangle and sublaminar wires were performed. The patient has been symptom free and without signs of a recurrence in the spine for over 13 months. A large abdominal paraganglioma was recently resected from its probable origin from the adventitia of the abdominal aorta. 
1	True hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, 46,XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy. The first case (to the authors' knowledge) is reported of a true hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, a 46, XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy. The true hermaphroditism was diagnosed during infancy. The patient was subsequently found to have a gonadoblastoma and a microscopic dysgerminoma in the gonad diagnosed as an ovotestis and excised during infancy. The successful pregnancy occurred when the patient was 29 years old. A year later a large gonadal tumor affecting the remaining gonad was excised. The gonad was found to be an ovotestis, and the tumor was a dysgerminoma arising from a gonadoblastoma. This case further emphasizes the malignant potential of the Y chromosome in patients with abnormal gonads. 
5	Subarachnoid hemorrhage of unknown etiology: early prognostic factors for long-term functional capacity. Forty-one patients suffering subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) of unknown etiology were re-investigated at an average of 91 months after the bleed to determine functional capacity. Nineteen patients were performing at their previous level of work, five were employed part-time, and four could not work due to the SAH. Five patients showed a moderate disability in activities of daily living but were not dependent on help, one patient was severely disabled, and two had died. There was one rebleed. Early prognosis of an unfavorable outcome was possible on the basis of three clinical variables on admission: a history of hypertension, a Hunt and Hess grade of greater than II, and the presence of focal neurological deficits. In addition, the presence of an organic mental syndrome at discharge was identified as a predictive factor for reduced functional capacity later on. Other clinical variables in the acute stage, including sex, age, history of headache, interval between SAH and admission, impaired consciousness, and cognitive deficits, were not related to a limited functional level. Residual neurological deficits and the Glasgow Outcome Scale score on discharge were also not predictive of restrictions in global functions evaluated by means of the Karnofsky Performance Scale status at follow-up review. 
5	Litigation and employment status: effects on patients with chronic pain. In order to study the effects of compensation and litigation, 201 chronic pain patients were selected from a sample of 444: 99 were working, 15 were working and litigating, 53 were receiving Worker's Compensation, and 34 were receiving Worker's Compensation and litigating. Employment (working vs. Worker's Compensation) and litigation status (litigating vs. not litigating) were analyzed in a 2 x 2 factorial design with measures of pain, disability, psychological distress, and selected demographics as dependent variables. Compared to Worker's Compensation patients, working patients reported significantly less disability (down-time, days spent in bed, interference of pain in daily activities) and pain of a longer duration. Compared to litigating patients, non-litigating patients reported less pain (on the McGill Pain Questionnaire) and less disability (stopping activity, interference of pain in daily activities). On two measures of psychological distress (depression, anxiety), there were significant interactions: Worker's Compensation patients who were litigating reported less distress than non-litigants, while working patients who were litigating reported more distress than non-litigants. The results indicate clear differences in self-reports of disability associated with both employment and litigation status. They also suggest that litigation may function as a coping response for patients who are distressed by the adversarial nature of the Worker's Compensation system. Limitations of the study as well as suggestions for further research also are discussed. 
3	Transient hyperprolactinemia is associated with a midcycle luteinizing hormone surge. This study demonstrates that LH surge cycles in IVF patients were associated with significantly higher serum PRL concentrations than cycles in which a spontaneous LH surge did not occur. Our findings support the hypothesis of concomitant LH and PRL release at the time of the midcycle gonadotropin surge, as well as that of estrogen sensitization of pituitary lactotropes, and suggest a possible mechanism for transient midcycle hyperprolactinemia. 
3	An unusual manifestation of Paget's disease of bone: spinal epidural hematoma presenting as acute cauda equina syndrome. Neurologic sequelae of Paget's disease of bone include involvement of the spinal cord or cauda equina due to mechanical compression by enlarged vertebrae, ischemia caused by a spinal artery, steal syndrome or neoplasm. We describe a patient with Paget's disease of bone who presented with acute cauda equina syndrome due to a spinal epidural hematoma. Clinicians need to recognize this entity since surgical intervention may result in a favorable outcome. 
3	Familial trigeminal neuralgia and Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuropathy. Report of two families and review. Typical trigeminal neuralgia has occasionally occurred in multiple members of the same family over several generations. The clinical features of such cases, including the increased incidence in females, and the absence of other apparent hereditary, neurologic, metabolic, or structural abnormalities were identical to those of sporadic cases. More rarely, familial trigeminal neuralgia has been described in the setting of hereditary peripheral neuropathy, especially Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We describe patients from two different families with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease and medically intractable trigeminal neuralgia. Both patients were successfully treated by percutaneous retrogasserian glycerol rhizolysis. The occurrence of cranial nerve symptoms in patients with demyelinating peripheral neuropathies is discussed in light of the current hypotheses regarding the etiology of trigeminal neuralgia. 
5	Rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure. The pathogenesis and therapy of respiratory failure in the rigid spine syndrome are discussed in two cases who improved with respiratory assistance. In both cases, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide were reversed in arterial blood gas analysis and %VC was less than 30%. Remission from respiratory failure has been obtained by the use of a ventilator during the night. The cause of the respiratory failure in both cases was severe restrictive respiratory dysfunction due to extreme flattening of the chest and fixation of the thorax during respiration as a result of contracture of costovertebral joints. All the previously reported cases of the rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure died. Appropriate use of the ventilator can improve the prognosis. 
5	Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with an internal carotid artery web Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that most commonly affects cervical carotid arteries at the C1-C2 level when cephalic arteries are involved. Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of fibromuscular dysplasia exist; most have a benign natural history. We describe the third reported case of a pathologically proven, symptomatic proximal internal carotid artery web and suggest that patients with this lesion are at a higher risk for stroke. 
3	Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (L-tryptophan-associated neuromyopathy). Histopathologic study of skeletal muscle biopsy in a patient with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome following L-tryptophan use showed prominent lymphocytic perineuritis, neuritis, and perimysial fasciitis. The presence of perineuritis and neuritis provides a histopathologic basis for clinical features of neuropathy in eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and occurred in conjunction with a fasciitis or interstitial myositis that was predominantly perimysial and focally endomysial. 
1	Papillary adenocarcinoma of the middle ear. A case of papillary adenocarcinoma of the middle ear is presented. The patient had an unusually short history of otalgia, aural discharge and facial palsy, and, at presentation the tumour was too large for surgical resection to be a feasible option. The management of this rare tumour is discussed and the relevant literature reviewed. 
1	Sarcoid reaction mimicking intrathoracic dissemination of testicular cancer. The close observation of patients treated for testicular cancer led to the suspicion of intrathoracic and/or mediastinal metastases on radiologic examination in a number of patients without other evidence of relapse. This report presents two patients with combined seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors with isolated sarcoid reactions of hilar and interlobular lymph nodes, detected concomitant with diagnosis and 12 months after diagnosis, respectively. Histologic examination appears to be imperative in these cases to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy. 
1	Local-regional breast cancer recurrence following mastectomy. Local-regional recurrence patterns were investigated in 1392 patients with breast cancer. Primary treatment for all patients included a mastectomy. Nine hundred seventeen patients had negative nodes and did not receive systemic therapy. Four hundred seventy-five patients had node metastases and were randomized to receive different combinations of chemoendocrine therapy. Follow-up ranged between 5 and 16 years. Two hundred thirty (25.8%) node-negative patients have had recurrences, with the initial recurrence being local-regional in 9.2%. Two hundred forty-two (50.9%) node-positive patients have had recurrences, with the initial recurrence being local-regional in 17.1%. Larger tumors and more extensive node involvement were associated with more first local-regional recurrences. The relative percent of first local-regional recurrence among patients in whom cancer recurred was similar for node-negative and node-positive patients (35.4% and 33.5%, respectively). In 63.6% of patients in whom cancer recurred, first local-regional recurrence were distant. Larger tumors, more extensive node involvement, and a shorter disease-free interval after mastectomy were associated with more rapid appearance of distant recurrence among these patients. 
5	Closure of refractory perineal Crohn's lesion. Integration of hyperbaric oxygen into case management. A case is reported in which a comprehensive program of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO), surgical debridement and reconstruction, and continuing medical management resulted in complete and sustained closure of an extensive perineal Crohn's lesion refractory to conventional medical and surgical management. It is emphasized that in this case healing occurred in the setting of previous removal of all diseased intestinal tissue and only with the combined use of all three treatment modalities. HBO may be a useful adjunct in the therapy of large nonhealing perineal lesions post-proctocolectomy in patients who are unresponsive to metronidazole or to immunosuppressant therapy or who experience limiting side effects from continued medical therapy. 
5	Allopurinol and thiazide effects on new urinary stone formed after discontinued therapy in patients with urinary stones. We treated 87 patients with calcium-containing urinary stones with either allopurinol alone (44 patients) or in combination with thiazide (43 patients) and studied new stone formation before, during, and after the discontinuation of the drug therapy. The number of stones formed were 1.18, 0.24, and 0.13 before, during, and after discontinuation of the drug therapy, respectively, in the patients treated with allopurinol alone and 1.32, 0.20, and 0.09 in those treated in combination with thiazide. No differences were observed in these values and the duration of each observation period between the two groups. Decreases in the incidence of stone formation even after interruption of drug therapy suggested that recurrence-preventive effects observed following administration of these drugs include the effects of medical guidance. However, allopurinol therapy was effective in preventing recurrence in patients with hyperuricosuria. 
1	A cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clone derived from mice with progressively growing tumors. Tumor-specific T-cell clones were derived from spleen cells of mice bearing a syngeneic PHS-5 tumor (a P815 mastocytoma mutant). Cells were expanded in vitro and characterized and assayed for activity against the relevant tumor in vivo. Clone cells were CD4-, CD8+ T lymphocytes, as determined by fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis and were specifically cytotoxic against P815 tumor cells in vitro, as shown in chromium 51 release assays. These cells require both antigen and interleukin 2 to proliferate; neither alone is sufficient, even with the addition of interleukin 1. In an experimental P815 liver metastasis model, the adoptive transfer of GD11 or GD11.17 clone cells and injection of recombinant interleukin 2 (7500 U intraperitoneally) 3 days after infusion of tumor cells reduced the number of tumor nodules, while the adoptive transfer of lymphokine-activated killer cells was ineffective. 
2	Longitudinal histopathologic assessment of rejection after bladder-drained canine pancreas allograft transplantation. In preparation for assessment of percutaneous biopsies in our clinical pancreas transplant program, a working knowledge of the histopathologic changes after transplantation was obtained in a longitudinal open biopsy study of 16 dogs receiving bladder-drained whole pancreas allografts. Edema, extravasation of polymorphs, and lymphocytes associated with focal parenchymal injury were early, invariable, and probably nonspecific findings. The initial feature of unmodified rejection was the appearance of capillary and small vein endothelial changes with mainly perivascular inflammatory cell infiltration. Acinar cell loss occurred early and was progressive, whereas islets and ducts were relatively preserved, indicating that acinar tissue may be more vulnerable to lytic necrosis when damaged. Functional rejection, determined by fasting urinary amylase levels, was at a stage of extensive and irreversible necrosis. Functioning grafts in immunosuppressed dogs had minor and transient endothelial changes with absence of class II antigen staining of parenchymal cells. 
2	The long-term effects of radiation therapy on patients with ovarian dysgerminoma. A retrospective chart review and questionnaire study was undertaken to look at the long-term effects of radiation therapy in ovarian dysgerminoma patients. Forty-three patients and 55 controls responded to a questionnaire that detailed bowel, bladder, thyroid, menstrual, reproductive, sexual, and growth function. Statistically significant differences in the number of bowel movements were noticed when comparing patients with controls. The authors noticed no significant differences between cases and controls in bladder function. No thyroid disorders were attributable to mediastinal radiation therapy. Most patients with intact uteri bleed monthly on hormonal replacement. Three patients with a remaining ovary and uterus resumed menstrual function after substantial doses of abdominopelvic radiation therapy. No patients have conceived. The authors noticed a slight increase in dyspareunia in the treated group, but most patients were satisfied with their sexual function. One premenarchal patient exhibited a growth disorder. 
2	Protein-losing enteropathy in systemic lupus erythematosus associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia. This case report concerns a young woman with systemic lupus erythematosus who presented with a protein-losing enteropathy. Intestinal biopsy revealed lymphangiectasia. Mesenteric lymph nodes showed paracortical lymphoid depletion and multiple small sinusoids. Elevated cholesterol levels and normal lymphocyte counts characterized the peripheral blood samples. Lymph nodes, though enlarged, showed no evidence of obstructive pathology. No secondary cause of lymphangiectasia could be identified. The patient exhibited antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to dsDNA at the onset, and then, 5 yr later, the classic features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The lymphocytopenia and hypolipidemia that characterizes lymphangiectasia is not a feature of the SLE cases reported to date. Furthermore, the mechanism for the dilated lymphatics and villous edema is more likely immunological than mechanical disruption of lymphatics. 
4	Regional cardiac adrenergic function using I-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine tomographic imaging after acute myocardial infarction. The effect of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on regional cardiac adrenergic function was studied in 27 patients mean +/- standard deviation 10 +/- 4 days after AMI. Regional adrenergic function was evaluated noninvasively with I-123 meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) using a dedicated 3-detector tomograph. Four hours after its administration, there was reduced MIBG uptake in the region of infarction, 0.38 +/- 0.31 counts/pixel/mCi x 103 compared with 0.60 +/- 0.30 counts/pixel/mCi x 103 and 0.92 +/- 0.35 counts/pixel/mCi x 103 in the zones bordering and distant from the infarct area, respectively, p less than 0.001. In all patients, the area of reduced MIBG uptake after 4 hours was more extensive that the associated thallium-201 perfusion defect with defect scores of 52 +/- 22 and 23 +/- 18%, respectively, p less than 0.001. After anterior wall AMI, the 4-hour MIBG defect score was 70 +/- 13% and the degree of mismatch between myocardial perfusion and MIBG uptake was 30 +/- 9% compared with 39 +/- 17 and 21 +/- 17% after inferior AMI, p less than 0.001 and p = 0.016, respectively. The 4-hour MIBG defect score correlated inversely with the predischarge left ventricular ejection fraction, r = -0.73, p less than 0.001. Patients with ventricular arrhythmia of greater than or equal to 1 ventricular premature complexes per hour, paired ventricular premature complexes or ventricular tachycardia detected during the late hospital phase had higher 4-hour MIBG defect scores, 62.5 +/- 15.0%, than patients with no detectable complex ventricular ectopic activity and a ventricular premature complex frequency of less than 1 per hour, 44.6 +/- 23.4%, p = 0.036. 
5	Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to study the genetic origin of complete hydatidiform mole. To determine the genetic origin of the complete hydatidiform mole, 20 abnormal pregnancies were studied with restriction fragment length polymorphism with five genomic probes: EJ 6.6, beta-globin gene, 3'alpha-hypervariable region, J-Bir, and St14. In the 12 cases of molar pregnancy, pure paternal origin was proved in 11 cases, but both maternal and paternal inheritance were shown in only one case. In the cases with pure paternal origin, all of the restriction fragment length polymorphisms were homozygous, although those of the fathers were heterozygous at 15 loci. In the four cases that mimicked hydatidiform mole but were diagnosed as hydropic change of villi, both paternal and maternal inheritance were noted. In the four pregnancies with blighted ovum, both paternal and maternal inheritance were shown in three cases; and in one case with a balanced translocation between chromosomes 13 and 14, only paternal inheritance was noted. This study showed that most of the complete hydatidiform moles were caused by fertilization of an empty egg by a duplicated haploid sperm, but rare exceptions may exist. 
2	Choledochotomy for calculous disease in the elderly. To determine the risk of operations on the biliary tract in the elderly, we retrospectively examined 56 patients 80 years of age or older undergoing choledochotomy for calculous disease and compared their outcomes with those of a contemporary group of 257 patients undergoing similar surgery. Thirty of 56 elderly patients (54%) required urgent surgery for acute cholangitis, acute cholecystitis, or obstructive jaundice (serum bilirubin greater than 5 mg/dL), compared with 97 of 257 younger patients (38%) (p = 0.029). Mortality in elderly patients was significantly higher (5 of 56) than in younger (6 of 257) patients (p = 0.015). In three of the five patients who died, urgent surgery was performed for obstructive jaundice, reflecting the higher mortality experienced by jaundiced patients in the entire series (9.4%). Biliary cultures grew organisms in 25 of 27 elderly patients (93%). This is in contrast to findings of bactibilia in 62 of 118 patients (53%) under the age of 80 (p = 0.001). Similarly, preoperative blood cultures were positive more often in elderly (63%) than in younger patients (26%) (p = 0.007). Mean postoperative hospital recovery was longer in the elderly group (16.2 +/- 8.5 days) than in the younger group (12.2 +/- 9.3 days) (p = 0.002). In conclusion, elderly patients, particularly those with obstructive jaundice, are at higher risk for complicated biliary tract disease necessitating choledochotomy. They appear to be more susceptible to bactibilia and bacteremia, and require longer hospital recovery than younger patients. 
5	Broad spectrum penicillin as an adequate therapy for acute cholangitis. In a previous study of patients with acute cholecystitis, we demonstrated equal efficacy with a broad spectrum penicillin (piperacillin) and a penicillin plus amino-glycoside combination. Whether a single agent broad spectrum penicillin is adequate treatment for more severe infections, such as acute cholangitis, however, is still unclear. We, therefore, conducted a three center, prospective, randomized trial to determine whether or not a broad spectrum penicillin alone is adequate therapy for patients with acute cholangitis. During a 36 month period, 96 patients with sepsis and biliary obstruction were randomly assigned to receive either piperacillin (n = 49) or ampicillin plus tobramycin (n = 47). The two groups receiving antibiotics were similar with respect to all clinical and laboratory parameters. The incidence of blood cultures with positive results (20 versus 21 per cent) and underlying malignant lesions (51 versus 62 per cent) was also similar between the two groups. The percentage of patients with a clinical cure or significant improvement was the same in the two groups (69 versus 70 per cent). However, there was a significant difference in the cure rate between patients with benign and malignant biliary obstructions (83 versus 59 per cent, p less than 0.01). No significant differences were noted between the two antibiotic groups with respect to drug toxicity, but patients with malignant conditions were more prone to antibiotic related toxicities (2 versus 19 per cent, p less than 0.05). These data suggest that outcome of treatment in patients with acute cholangitis is similar with either a broad spectrum penicillin or a penicillin plus aminoglycoside combination and is dependent upon the nature of the biliary obstruction. 
1	Immunochemical studies on the differential binding properties of two monoclonal antibodies reacting with Tn red cells. Two monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs), BRIC 66 (IgM) and BRIC 111 (IgG1), were produced by immunizing mice with ovarian cyst blood group A1 glycoprotein and Tn red cells (RBCs), respectively. Their specificities were determined by inhibitions using Tn sialoglycoproteins (SGPs), mucins (armadillo [ASG] and ovine [OSG] submaxillary glycoproteins), and monosaccharides. BRIC 66 agglutinated both Tn and group A RBCs and reacted immunohistochemically with both the vascular endothelium and tumor cells from a group A adenocarcinoma, BRIC 66 was inhibited by N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), Tn SGPs, and mucins on both hemagglutination inhibition tests and radioimmunoassay. BRIC 111 agglutinated Tn RBCs only, and it specifically stained tumor cells from a group O patient's breast carcinoma and a group A patient's adenocarcinoma. In hemagglutination inhibition tests, BRIC 111 was readily inhibited by Tn SGPs, only partially inhibited by GalNAc, and not inhibited by mucins. In a sensitive radioimmunoassay, BRIC 111 was inhibitable by GalNAc. Tn SGP was 2000-fold more effective as an inhibitor than the mucins (ASG and desialized OSG), which contain a high content of terminal alpha-GalNAc-O-serine (threonine) residues. It is postulated that BRIC 66 is specific for terminal alpha-GalNAc units in carbohydrate chains. The exclusive reaction of BRIC 111 with Tn SGP indicates a combining site larger than GalNAc alpha-1, which probably includes amino acid residues in juxtaposition to GalNAc in Tn SGP. In view of its specific agglutination of Tn RBCs, BRIC 111 is a useful reagent for the examination of polyagglutinable RBCs. 
1	Intraoral adenoid cystic carcinoma. The presence of perineural spread in relation to site, size, local extension, and metastatic spread in 22 cases. Twenty-two patients with an intraoral adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), initially treated by surgery with or without postoperative radiotherapy, were examined for the presence of perineural spread in relation to primary site, size, local extension, histologic status of the surgical margins, and metastatic spread of the tumor. There seems to be no correlation between perineural spread and the primary site or size of the tumor. However, perineural spread occurred more often in tumors with local extension and in cases with surgical margins with positive results. There seems to be no statistically significant correlation between perineural invasion and distant metastatic disease. 
1	Expression of the antimetastatic gene nm23 in human breast cancer: an association with good prognosis. The nm23 gene was identified in murine melanoma cells, in which its expression is associated with the cells' metastatic potential. Expression of nm23 has been detected in human breast tumors by means of hybridization and immunocytochemistry. We measured nm23 mRNA in 71 patients with primary breast cancer and found variable levels of nm23 expression. The nm23 gene was expressed at higher levels in well-differentiated tumors (P less than .02). There was a significant inverse relationship between nm23 expression and nodal status (P less than .02). Expression of nm23 was positively associated with longer disease-free survival and overall survival, and the relationships were significant (P less than .002 and P less than .003, respectively). This study showed that nm23 expression in human breast cancer was associated with good prognosis and a lack of lymph node metastasis and suggests that the nm23 gene product may play an important role in suppressing the metastatic phenotype. 
1	Resection and reconstruction for soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremity. Soft-tissue sarcomas are uncommon malignant tumors, and when a diagnosis is made early, the patient has up to an 80% chance of surviving. In treating soft-tissue sarcomas, the goal of the surgeon is the prolongation of patient survival, the total eradication of local disease, and the minimization of functional deficits. In addition to treatment, this article discusses evaluation, histology, and staging. 
1	Hormonal treatment of functional ovarian cysts: a randomized, prospective study. Estrogen (E)/progestin therapy for functional ovarian cysts is widely used in clinical practice, but the efficacy of this treatment has not been determined in controlled trials. In this study, we examined the effect of E/progestin administration in a group of infertility patients enrolled in a program of ovulation induction who had cysts identified by transvaginal sonography. Patients were randomized to receive either norethindrone 1 mg/mestranol 0.05 mg/d (group A, n = 24) or no treatment (group B, n = 24) for up to 6 weeks. Patients were re-evaluated by sonography at 3, 6, and 9 weeks after entry into the protocol. The ages, mean cyst diameters, and proportions of patients having received gonadotropins in the previous menstrual cycle were not significantly different among the two groups. All patients who had a sonographic abnormality persisting for 9 weeks were surgically explored and found to have pathological cysts. The rate of disappearance of functional ovarian cysts was not affected by E/progestin treatment. 
1	Symptomatic pineal cyst: case report. Pineal cysts are being described with increasing frequency since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging. Although pineal cysts are incidental findings in as many as 4% of magnetic resonance imaging studies, symptomatic pineal cysts are quite rare. We present a case of pineal cyst causing aqueductal obstruction with symptomatic hydrocephalus and resultant headache and syncope, which was treated by surgical resection. A review of the relevant literature and discussion follow. 
1	Mechanism of antitumor activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha with hyperthermia in a tumor necrosis factor alpha-resistant tumor. Cells from a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) are exceedingly resistant to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in vitro. We tested whether the addition of mild hyperthermia (42.5 degrees C, 30 minutes) could enhance TNF-alpha activity against RIF-1 tumors growing in syngeneic hosts (C3H mice). TNF-alpha was administered intratumorally. Tumor cell killing essentially was not measurable following TNF-alpha, hyperthermia, or a combination of the two. Single-modality treatments also had no effect on tumor growth delay or on the x-ray dose (given 24 hours after the primary treatment) required to sterilize 50% of the tumors. The combination of TNF-alpha and hyperthermia, however, resulted in a marked increase in tumor doubling time and a highly significant reduction in the x-ray dose required to sterilize the tumors. Syngeneic lymph nodal lymphocytes and blood leukocytes did not appear to mediate the action of TNF-alpha on RIF-1 cells in vitro. Necrosis and hemorrhage were the most prominent histopathological alterations in the treated tumors. Electron microscopic studies 6 hours after therapy showed increased damage to capillary endothelial cells and accumulation of neutrophils in the capillaries of tumors treated with TNF-alpha with or without heat, suggesting that neutrophils may mediate the endothelial cell injury. These observations indicate a greater than additive tumoricidal effect of TNF-alpha with hyperthermia. Furthermore, they support the concept that the interaction between the two agents damages the vasculature, compromising the microcirculation and ultimately causing ischemic tumor necrosis. 
1	Boronate affinity chromatography of gamma-glutamyltransferase in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. We analyzed the serum gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT) by boronate affinity chromatography to ascertain the presence or absence of any changes in the binding properties of gamma-GT toward boronate gels in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis, and in normal controls. The mean gamma-GT activity ratio of the bound (peak 2) and nonbound (peak 1) fraction in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma was significantly higher than that in patients with liver cirrhosis or in normal controls. Thus, the gamma-GT, which has adjacent cis-hydroxyl groups in its carbohydrate moieties, was found to increase in the serum of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The positivity rate was examined in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis, using a cut-off level for the peak 2:peak 1 ratio of 1.05 (mean + 2 SD of liver cirrhosis). Nineteen (42.2%) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma had a ratio of peak 2:peak 1 higher than 1.05. Nine of the 19 patients who had serum alpha-fetoprotein levels below 100 ng/ml had an elevated peak 2:peak 1 ratio. In total, 77.8% of the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma could be detected by a combination of these two markers. Three patients who had developed hepatocellular carcinoma during the course of cirrhosis but remained negative for alpha-fetoprotein throughout the course developed higher levels of peak 2:peak 1 ratio when hepatocellular carcinoma occurred. These results indicate that the two markers, the peak 2:peak 1 ratio of serum gamma-GT activity and serum alpha-fetoprotein level, may be considered to serve as complementary markers for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging for assessment of vena caval tumor thrombi: a comparative study with venacavography and computerized tomography scanning. We assessed the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging in demonstrating the presence and extent of vena caval tumor thrombi. The study group included 20 patients with vena caval thrombi from renal cell carcinoma (18), renal pelvic transitional cell carcinoma (1) and adrenal pheochromocytoma (1). Preoperative diagnostic studies included magnetic resonance imaging in all patients, inferior venacavography in 16 and computerized tomography scanning in 15. All patients underwent an operation in which the presence and extent of the vena caval thrombus were confirmed. Magnetic resonance imaging accurately delineated the presence and extent of the thrombus in all 20 patients (100%). Venacavography was accurate in 15 patients (94%) but 8 (50%) required a retrograde and antegrade study. Computerized tomography scanning demonstrated the presence of a tumor thrombus in all 15 patients but accurately delineated the cephalad extent of the thrombus in only 5 (33%). In patients with vena caval tumor thrombi magnetic resonance imaging can provide accurate information regarding the extent of vena caval involvement while avoiding the need for an invasive contrast imaging study. 
1	Perforation and tumor formation of the intestine in primary amyloidosis. We report a case of primary amyloidosis with repeated bowel perforations. This patient also had localized amyloid deposition creating a tumorous region mimicking malignancy in the rectum. Perforation of the intestine is common in systemic amyloidosis. The ischemic change due to amyloid infiltration into the vessel wall may lead to perforation of the affected bowel. Amyloid tumors occur more often in localized amyloid than in systemic amyloidosis. Macroscopically, it is difficult to distinguish amyloid tumor of the intestine from neoplasia. 
2	Ascites revealing peritoneal and hepatic extramedullary hematopoiesis with peliosis in agnogenic myeloid metaplasia: case report and review of the literature. A 61-year-old man presented with ascites in the course of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia (AMM). Ascitic fluid was exudative and contained mature and immature leukocytes, erythroid cells, and megakaryocytes as observed on a bone marrow smear. Peritoneal biopsy showed myeloid metaplasia, and liver biopsy revealed intrasinusoidal myeloid metaplasia and peliosis. Ascites cleared after abdominal radiotherapy but treatment resulted in transient aplasia. Subsequently, portal hypertension was demonstrated by hepatic transjugular catheterization. Complications of splenomegaly led to splenectomy and splenorenal shunt followed by fatal acute hepatitis and septic shock. A review of the literature and an analysis of mechanisms of ascites occurring in AMM, especially peritoneal implants of myeloid tissue and occurrence of peliosis in myeloproliferative disorders, are presented. 
1	Microinvasive carcinoma of the uterine cervix (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics Stage IA). In 1985 the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) subdivided Stage IA cervical cancer and specified metric criteria to demarcate Stage IA from Stage IB. Early stromal invasion (Stage IA1) denotes the first invasive protrusions of a carcinoma in situ into the stroma. Microcarcinomas (Stage IA2) are small cancers a number of orders of magnitude larger than Stage IA1 lesions and with a maximum depth of invasion of 5 mm and a maximum horizontal spread of 7 mm; larger lesions are classified as Stage IB. This study reviews 486 patients previously classified as having Stage IA disease. This yielded 344 Stage IA1 and 101 Stage IA2 lesions; 41 cancers were reclassified as Stage IB. Three hundred nine, 89, and 38 patients were followed for greater than or equal to 5 years. One (0.3%) patient with Stage IA1 disease re-presented with Stage IIB disease 12 years after conization. Five (5.6%) patients with Stage IA2 lesions developed invasive recurrences; three died. None of the 38 patients reclassified as having a Stage IB lesion, including 16 who were treated conservatively, developed a recurrence. The FIGO classification is not a guideline for treatment. Stage IA1 lesions can be treated conservatively, but treatment in Stage IA2 must be individualized. Risk factors such as vascular space involvement and confluency are of high sensitivity but low specificity. 
1	Composite reconstruction for chest wall and scalp using multiple ribs-latissimus dorsi osteomyocutaneous flaps as pedicled and free flaps. A composite flap is presented based on the latissimus dorsi myocutaneous unit together with the underlying ninth to eleventh ribs. Three patients are presented. In two, a full-thickness chest-wall defect was present. In one, a full-thickness scalp and cranial defect was present. Use of the composite osteomyocutaneous latissimus dorsi free flap as a pedicled flap in two patients and as a free flap in one patient resulted in successful definitive reconstruction in all with no complications. This procedure necessitates no transplantation of soft tissue prior to bone grafting to maintain local vascularity, so the simultaneous one-stage reconstruction of an osseous-soft-tissue defect becomes possible easily. 
4	Decreased operative risk of surgical treatment of mitral regurgitation with or without coronary artery disease. The consecutive 2 year experience with patients undergoing first-time surgery for mitral regurgitation with and without coronary artery disease was reviewed. From January 1988 to January 1990, 127 patients with pure mitral regurgitation undergoing first-time operation were surgically treated. No other valve lesion, no reoperation and no congenital defects were included. The mean patient age was 62 years with 26% of the patients greater than 70 years. Twenty-six percent of the entire group was in functional class IV. Seventy-five patients received mitral valve repair and 52 underwent mitral valve replacement with a St. Jude or Hancock valve. In patients undergoing mitral valve repair, there was a higher incidence of those greater than 70 years old and of coronary artery disease and in patients undergoing mitral valve replacement there was a higher incidence of functional class IV. The operative mortality rate was 2.3% (3 of 127 patients). No patient failed to be discontinued from cardiopulmonary bypass and all three deaths occurred after mitral valve replacement, with one from complications of chronic renal failure and dialysis. There was no significant difference in patients who either did or did not have a concomitant coronary artery bypass graft and there was no difference related to age or functional class. Postoperative complications occurred in five patients in the valve repair group, including recurrent mitral regurgitation in two necessitating reoperation, and in three patients in the valve replacement group. With newer operative and postoperative management techniques, especially preservation of the papillary muscle annular continuity, the risk of mitral valve surgery, particularly of valve repair, is considerably lower than in previous years. 
1	The effect of metoclopramide on ovarian responsiveness to gonadotropin administration in patients with severe polycystic ovarian syndrome. Six patients with poor ovarian response to menotropin after pretreatment with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog exhibited improved ovarian responsiveness when metoclopramide was added on days 3, 5, and 7 of the cycle. This was evidenced by a higher number of leading follicles (4.4 versus 0.6), a higher mean of maximal serum 17 beta-estradiol levels (560 versus 178 pg/mL), a shorter duration of menotropin treatment (7 versus 11 days), and fewer ampules of menotropin used (20 versus 37 ampules/cycle) in metoclopramide-treated cycles as compared with control cycles, respectively. Serum prolactin levels reached a maximum of 172 ng/mL within 1 hour after metoclopramide administration and declined to normal range within 6 hours. These results suggest that intermittent increased prolactin secretion may augment ovarian response to gonadotropins. 
5	Helicobacter pylori and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Helicobacter pylori (previously Campylobacter pylori) is almost invariably associated with chronic duodenal ulcer disease. The relationship between H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is unknown. We investigated the frequency of H. pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and also what effect H. pylori infection had on gastric function in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. H. pylori infection was diagnosed based on a specific serologic (ELISA) assay based on high-molecular-weight cell-associated proteins of H. pylori. We studied 20 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; 15 men and 5 women ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, median age 51. Six Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients had H. pylori infection compared to 100 consecutive patients with chronic recurrent duodenal ulcer disease (P less than 0.05). Pretreatment basal acid output in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients ranged from 7.9 to 95.0 mmol/hr, median 35.2. Pentagastrin-stimulated maximal acid output ranged from 8.5 to 132 mmol/hr; median 52.7. Acid secretion was lower in the H. pylori-infected patients than the uninfected patients (BAO 24.5 +/- 6.5 vs 45.4 +/- 6.6, and MAO 44.3 +/- 11.8 vs 67.9 +/- 10.7, for H. pylori infected vs uninfected patients, respectively). The difference in BAO was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). The present results indicate that H. pylori is not a major contributing factor in duodenal ulcer associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The association of a reduced BAO with H. pylori suggests that these findings may be related. 
4	Pulmonary effects of ischemic limb reperfusion: evidence for a role for oxygen-derived radicals. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the lung as a reperfusion target after limb ischemia-reperfusion, and to measure specifically the oxygen radical response to this reperfusion. DESIGN: Paired simple randomized, with continuous interval data in dependent variable and both continuous and nominal independent variables. SUBJECTS AND INTERVENTION: Sprague-Dawley male rats (n = 195) were anesthetized and both hind limbs occluded for 3.75 hr, the overnight LD50. Alveolar lavage was performed on the animals 1 hr after reperfusion or on survivors 20 hr after reperfusion. Groups were either undosed or pretreated with alpha-tocopherol as an antioxidant (50 mg/kg.day) 2 days before ischemia. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence was measured in both phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated and unstimulated macrophages. Nanomoles of superoxide radicals per 10(6) alveolar cells/min were also measured using a cytochrome c reduction assay. A significant (p less than .01, Student's t-test), time-dependent increase in response of cells from ischemic-reperfused rats was seen. Pretreatment with antioxidant had no effect at 1 hr, but significant differences were seen in the 20-hr survivors. CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that alveolar lavage cells, 95% macrophages, reflect the reperfusion of ischemic-reperfused hind limbs by a significant increase in oxygen radical activity, an effect partly suppressed in antioxidant-dosed survivors. 
2	A rational attitude toward serum alanine aminotransferase measurement by blood banks, based on a longitudinal study of a cohort of repeat blood donors. A cohort of 879 blood donors was followed over a 3-year period. Of the 3858 units of blood collected, 112 (2.9%), obtained from 64 donors, had an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity over 45 IU per L; of these, 39 had a single ALT elevation. The incidence of ALT increase was 2.01 per 100 units, or 5.1 per 100 donors, per year. The pattern of elevated ALT was followed in 72 donors, 54 of whom were from the 64 cited above. At the second blood donation (BD2), about 5 months later, 62.5 percent had a normal ALT value, and most (91%) retained those values at blood donation 3 (BD3). However, 19 (70.3%) of the 27 whose ALT levels had not returned to normal at BD2 had an increased value at BD3. These results led to the formulation of the following algorithm to improve the management of blood donors; at the first donation, the ALT assay is done after the blood collection, but, at the next donation, the ALT level is measured before donation if the preceding ALT activity had been abnormal. If ALT is elevated, blood is not collected. Three consecutive ALT elevations are a criterion for permanent exclusion of the donor. 
5	Persistent and recurrent hyperparathyroidism: assessment with gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging. The effect of gadopentetate dimeglumine on signal intensity of abnormal parathyroid glands was assessed in 14 patients with persistent and recurrent hyperparathyroidism. Non-contrast material-enhanced T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo images were compared with T1-weighted images obtained 1 minute and 10 minutes after administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine. Percentage of contrast between the abnormal gland and surrounding tissue was determined with the use of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous fat, and thyroid gland as reference tissues. All 11 abnormal parathyroid glands showed low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Gadopentetate dimeglumine significantly increased the signal intensity enhancement ratio of all abnormal parathyroid glands, causing increased percentage of contrast relative to the thyroid gland and skeletal muscle on T1-weighted images. However, the percentage of contrast relative to these tissues was even greater on nonenhanced T2-weighted images. Thus, gadopentetate dimeglumine can substantially enhance the signal intensity of abnormal parathyroid glands and improve differential contrast with some neighboring tissues on T1-weighted images, but it does not improve contrast with surrounding tissue beyond that achieved on T2-weighted images. 
5	Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury. Temporal bone findings in two cases of head injury are reported. In one patient, longitudinal fractures occurred in both temporal bones, and extended to the middle ear bilaterally. Bleeding was seen in the tympanic cavity, mastoid air cells, internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. Bleeding was observed in the scala tympani, cochlear aqueduct and endolymphatic sac, but there were no fractures. In the other patient, bleeding was seen in the internal auditory meatus and facial nerve canal. In the right ear, endolymphatic hydrops was observed in all turns of the cochlea. 
2	Spontaneous rupture of the spleen in initial presentation of Hodgkin's disease. A 46-year-old man presented with a four-week history of fevers, occasional chills, and a two-week history of sweats and poor appetite. He also complained of progressive weakness and lethargy. After initial evaluation, while awaiting further consultation, the patient developed rapidly progressing abdominal pain and light-headedness. He was moved immediately into the emergency treatment area. He was noted to have an acute abdomen and was taken to surgery. An enlarged Hodgkin's-infiltrated spleen with an actively bleeding hematoma was removed. The patient denied any history of trauma. 
1	Magnetic resonance imaging of fourth ventricular epidermoid tumors. Two pathologically proved cases of epidermoid tumor of the fourth ventricle are presented; clinical history and computed tomographic, magnetic resonance imaging, and histopathologic findings are included. 
2	Use of plasmid profiles in the investigation of a patient with Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulcer disease. Plasmids may effect bacterial virulence and antibiotic resistance, and serve as epidemiologic markers. In this study, plasmid DNA profiles of serial isolates of Helicobacter pylori showed persistence of an identical strain of this organism in a patient with duodenal ulcer disease. Three control strains of H. pylori isolated from other patients contained plasmids different from each other and from that of the original patient; two of these strains had two plasmids each. These data have important implications for further study of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of H. pylori-related diseases. 
1	Cystic rheumatoid arthritis: description of a nonerosive form. In a study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 9% (n = 70) were found to have a cystic form. At radiologic examination of these patients with cystic RA, the first abnormality seen consisted of periarticular intraosseous cysts without erosions. The cysts were distributed symmetrically, most often located at the proximal side of the joints and predominantly around the proximal interphalangeal, metacarpophalangeal, and wrist joints of the hands and the first interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints of the feet. Computed tomographic scans showed the peripheral intraosseous location of the cysts. Magnetic resonance images showed that the cysts may contain fluid, inflamed synovia, or both. Cysts can be an important feature in the diagnosis of RA and a supplement to the criteria of the American Rheumatism Association. Osteoporosis, joint-space narrowing, and joint destruction occurred less frequently in patients with cystic RA than in patients with classic RA. Of the patients with cystic RA, 54% were male, and 50% were seronegative. This study is a supplement to and an enlargement on earlier descriptions of cyst predominance in RA. 
5	Congenital craniofacial anomalies of ophthalmic importance. Congenital craniofacial abnormalities frequently require ophthalmic evaluation and surgical management. Called upon to perform as part of the craniofacial team managing the often severely deformed craniofacial patient, the ophthalmologist must bring a basic knowledge of craniofacial syndromes and developmental anatomy, as well as clinical acumen to help preserve or improve ocular and adnexal function. As an introduction to this area of ophthalmology, the clinical features, classification, appropriate facial embryology, assessment and surgical considerations of the various congenital craniofacial abnormalities are reviewed. The expanding availability of craniofacial surgeons and surgical teams along with improved surgical results will ultimately require an increasing involvement by many more ophthalmologists in the evaluation and management of these congenital abnormalities. 
5	Pathophysiologic changes in the critically ill patient: risk factors for ulceration and altered drug metabolism. Virtually all patients who are under the physiologic stress of an intensive care unit (ICU) are vulnerable to stress-related mucosal damage and ulceration. Although clinically significant hemorrhage from stress ulceration occurs in only 5-20 percent of patients in the ICU, the associated mortality is greater than 50 percent. The pathophysiologic mechanisms of stress ulcer are not well understood; however, a number of risk factors such as intraluminal gastric acidity and mucosal ischemia have been implicated. To prevent the development of stress ulcers and subsequent complications, it is important to identify and correct these underlying risk factors. Improving mucosal blood flow (i.e., fluid resuscitation and low-dose dopamine) and providing adequate nutritional support are invaluable adjuncts in minimizing the risk of stress ulcer formation. The use of pharmacologic prophylaxis controls the gastric acidity and prevents the formation of stress ulcers. The potential for drug-induced adverse effects and drug-drug interactions are of particular concern in the care of critically ill patients. Multiple organ system dysfunction or failure, malnutrition, fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, as well as the use of multiple pharmacologic agents predispose these patients to alterations in drug pharmacokinetics, drug-induced adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. These changes may alter the pharmacodynamic response to therapy and must be considered when designing drug dosage regimens for critically ill patients. 
1	Endometrioma of the liver. Hepatic endometriosis is extremely rare. We describe a patient sent to us with epigastric pain as the only symptom and who was found to have associated endometrioma of the liver and left ovary. We suggest a gynecologic evaluation before surgery for hepatic cyst of unknown cause. 
3	Quantitative proton magnetic resonance imaging in focal cerebral ischemia in rat brain. Proton magnetic resonance (MR) imaging has been recommended as a diagnostic tool for the detection of focal cerebral ischemia. We compared microscopic MR images of rat brains after focal cerebral ischemia with evidence of histological damage found on corresponding silver-impregnated or cresyl violet-stained brain sections. Ten male Wistar rats were subjected to permanent unilateral occlusions of the right middle cerebral and common carotid arteries under halothane anesthesia. Twenty-four hours later the area of injury on MR images amounted to 26% of the total slice area, whereas only 9% of the total slice area was necrotic on histological sections from the same animals. The infarcted areas on tissue sections were surrounded by regions of selective neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex and occasionally in the hippocampus. The area of injury on MR images was larger than the combined areas of infarction and selective neuronal injury on histological sections. Areas of increased T2 values on MR images extended medially into noninfarcted striatum and laterally and dorsally into noninfarcted cortex. The lateral and dorsal areas on MR images frequently coincided with cortical areas in which considerable selective neuronal injury was present in the upper cortical layers. We hypothesize that the abnormal areas on MR images above histologically normal brain tissue represent the ischemic penumbra. If true, this is the first demonstration of the ischemic penumbra by MR imaging and may reflect our use of Wistar rats, a new image analysis technique, and ultra-high resolution MR imaging. 
4	Videodensitometry versus digital calipers for quantitative coronary angiography. Single-plane left coronary angiograms in 18 patients were prospectively analyzed using videodensitometry (XR-70 system) and handheld digital calipers to compare arterial dimensions, stenosis dimensions, intraobserver variability and interobserver variability for the methods. A total of 648 arterial segments were measured, yielding a highly significant correlation between videodensitometry and caliper-determined cross-sectional area (r = 0.96, p = 0.0001). Similarly, a highly significant linear relation was observed between videodensitometry and caliper-determined diameter (r = 0.95, p = 0.0001). When data subsets for small, medium and large arterial segments were examined, higher variability in the correlation between videodensitometry and caliper-determined area was observed in the large segments (greater than 10 mm2). In addition, caliper-estimated areas tended to be slightly smaller than videodensitometry-estimated areas in these segments. For diameter estimations, correlations between caliper and videodensitometry data were similar for the entire range of arterial segment sizes. Intra- and interobserver variability was low for both caliper and videodensitometry determination of diameter or area. Thus, over a wide range of arterial dimensions, results obtained with caliper estimates of luminal area and diameter are comparable to those obtained with videodensitometry using the XR-70 system. 
1	Combined surgical resection and iridium 192 implantation for locally advanced and recurrent desmoid tumors. Thirty-eight histologically confirmed desmoid tumors were treated with conservative surgical resection and interstitial iridium 192. Patients included in this series constituted a poor prognostic group. Seventy five percent (75%) had previous recurrences of their disease and 50% had tumors 8 cm or greater in size. In addition, 16% of the patients had gross residual disease after surgical excision and 79% had positive or close margins of resection. With a median follow-up of 5.5 years, the 5-year actuarial in-field local control rate was 75% and the overall local control rate was 66%. Four of the 12 local recurrences developed at the periphery of the implant volume and four patients failed at least 3 cm or more beyond the treated volume. After salvage therapy, the 5-year actuarial local control rate was 95%. Two patients required amputation for recurrent disease. Thirty of 34 patients remain free of disease with an excellent functional result achieved. The authors conclude that surgical resection and postoperative interstitial iridium 192 is effective therapy for patients with desmoid tumors. Despite the fact that most patients in this series had bulky, recurrent tumors, excellent long-term local control and limb function were achieved. 
4	Effect of age on the efficacy of blood pressure treatment strategies. To study whether the proportion of excess cardiovascular events attributable to various levels of systolic blood pressure varies with age, we calculated the population-attributable risk of all-cause mortality, fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events (stroke, coronary heart disease, angina, congestive heart failure, and peripheral vascular disease), and stroke incidence due to systolic blood pressure in men and women 45 years of age or older in the United States during 1980. Our estimates are based on US census counts, blood pressure prevalence distributions from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and the annual risk of cardiovascular complications during 18 years of follow-up in the Framingham cohort. We then determined the impact of age on the relative efficacy of mass treatment and case-finding strategies in preventing systolic blood pressure-related events. At 45-54 years of age, only 30-40% of systolic blood pressure-related excess events occur in hypertensive individuals (systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg). With increasing age, however, the percentage of systolic blood pressure-related events that occur in hypertensive individuals rose substantially; in the older age group (greater than or equal to 75 years), 65-70% of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular disease events occur in hypertensive persons. The pattern is similar for men and women. The potential impact of a mass treatment strategy designed to shift the distribution of blood pressure downward by a small amount is greater in younger than in older groups, whereas an opposite trend is seen for a high-risk, hypertensive case-finding and treatment approach. 
5	Human immunodeficiency virus associated with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: successful treatment with zidovudine. Thrombocytopenia associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is well described, and two recent reports show a beneficial effect with the antiretroviral agent zidovudine (ZDV). HIV-associated thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) has recently been observed, but the use of ZDV for it has not been previously described. We have reported a case of relapsing TTP in an HIV-positive man who achieved remission with plasmapheresis and antiplatelet therapy initially, but multiple relapses necessitated the addition of vincristine and ZDV to induce a sustained remission. 
1	Resection and reconstruction for bone tumors in the proximal tibia. The proximal tibia is a common site for both benign and malignant tumors. This article reviews pertinent anatomy, clinical presentation, and staging methods for tumors of this area. Discussion is given to various methods of resection and reconstruction with useful guidelines for procedure selection. The use of allografts for reconstruction is discussed in depth. 
4	DMPO and reperfusion injury: arrhythmia, heart function, electron spin resonance, and nuclear magnetic resonance studies in isolated working guinea pig hearts. With the use of isolated working guinea pig hearts with normothermic global ischemia, it was shown that 5,5-dimethyl-pirroline-N-oxide (DMPO), an organic spin trap agent designed specifically to form stable adducts with oxygen free radicals in electron spin resonance studies, can dramatically reduce the vulnerability of the heart to reperfusion-induced arrhythmias. Studied in concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 mumol/L, DMPO exerted a dose-dependent protective effect. Thus, after 30 minutes of global ischemia, the incidence of ventricular fibrillation (total) and tachycardia was reduced from control values of 100% and 100% to 100% and 100%, 91% and 100%, 25% (p less than 0.001) and 50% (p less than 0.05), and 25% (p less than 0.001) and 41% (p less than 0.05), respectively, with DMPO concentrations of 10, 30, 100, and 500 mumol/L. Maximum signals of DMPO-OH adduct, with the use of electron spin resonance studies, were observed after 3 minutes of reperfusion in fibrillated hearts but were not detected in nonfibrillated hearts. Results of nuclear magnetic resonance studies of myocardial adenosine triphosphate, creatine phosphate, pH, and inorganic phosphate showed that these parameters were not significantly changed by treatment with DMPO, and consequently myocardial heart function was not improved, although there was a dissociation between myocardial adenosine triphosphate content and left ventricular developed pressure during reperfusion. The data presented here indicate that oxygen free radicals play an important role in the development of reperfusion-induced arrhythmias but trapping these cytotoxic free radicals does not improve the recovery of postischemic heart function and high-energy phosphate contents in isolated working guinea pig hearts. 
2	Alternation of gastric mucosal glycoprotein (lectin-binding pattern) in gastric mucosa in stress. A light and electron microscopic study. Gastric mucosal cells of the rat glandular stomach were studied by light and electron microscopic procedures by use of lectins in the development of acute gastric mucosal lesions. Effects of the H2-receptor antagonist sofalcone (2'carboxymethoxy-4,4'-bis 3-methyl-2) and truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty on lectin binding sites and distribution were also investigated. Biotinylated lectins in combination with ABC (avidin-biotinyl peroxidase complex) method were used for light and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled lectins for electron microscopic studies. Gastric mucosal cells showed the specific binding pattern for each lectin by light microscopy. Especially, binding sites and distribution of peanut agglutinin (PNA) were characteristic after induction of stress, truncal vagotomy, and administration of each drug. Staining and distribution increased in the gastric mucosa upward and downward after that. In electron microscopic studies, PNA strongly stained the membranes of the intracellular secretory canaliculi of a parietal cell. These results suggested that alternation of binding sites and distribution was regulated by change of gastric mucosal blood flow and of acidity in the parietal cells. Therefore, increase of glycoconjugate distribution is supposed to be a possibility of cytoprotective effect for a change of environment in the parietal cells. 
5	Pathogenesis and treatment of intra-abdominal infection. Intra-abdominal infection is considered potentially life-threatening. Such infection is frequently secondary to perforated viscera, trauma or inflammatory disease. Simple abscesses may be drained percutaneously with roentgenologic guidance; complex abscesses often require open surgical drainage. Secondary peritonitis is usually polymicrobial; broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy effective against aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, as well as gram-positive organisms, is essential. Newer antibiotics, administered either singly or in combination, have been used successfully to treat intra-abdominal infection while avoiding the toxicity of aminoglycosides. 
2	Pneumococcal peritonitis complicating CAPD--was the indwelling intrauterine device to blame? A 45-year-old woman on CAPD developed pneumococcal peritonitis. This is the second such case of Streptococcus pneumoniae peritonitis complicating CAPD. The role of an indwelling intrauterine device (IUD) in producing ascending infection into the peritoneum is discussed, especially in women with evidence of retrograde menstruation. A review of the literature concerning pneumococcal peritonitis associated with IUD is given. Possible contraception to women on CAPD is briefly mentioned. 
1	Spontaneous infarction of placental chorioangioma and associated regression of hydrops fetalis. We report a case of a large chorioangioma diagnosed prenatally with concomitant meconium peritonitis and hydrops fetalis in the second trimester. Spontaneous regression of the tumor occurred, associated with some resolution of the fetal hydrops and delivery near term with good neonatal outcome. 
4	Effects of mental stress on myocardial perfusion in patients with ischemic heart disease. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether and to what extent mental stress can reproduce the perfusion defects that are known to be induced by exercise. Twenty-four patients with recent myocardial infarction (New York Heart Association functional class I) and evidence of ischemic response were evaluated by means of SESTAMIBI scintigraphy performed once after exercise and then again within 2 days after mental arithmetic. Baseline, exercise, and mental stress planar scintigrams were divided into 15 segments, and each segment was reviewed and scored on a scale of 0 to 3 by experienced observers using circumferential profile analysis. Conflicting scores were resolved by consensus. Electrocardiographic abnormalities were found in 15 of 24 patients during exercise and in none during mental arithmetic. Chest pain was experienced by five patients during exercise and by none during mental stress. Twenty patients showed reversible perfusion defects during mental stress. Of the 360 pooled scintigram segments, 99 evidenced uptake defects during exercise, and 48 of these showed the same defects during mental stress. Twenty of the remaining 51 of 99 segments were adjacent to segments showing reversible hypoperfusion, suggesting milder hypoperfusion in these segments during mental arithmetic than during exercise. Furthermore, 10 segments showed reversible defects only during mental stress such that seven of these occurred in areas adjacent to those that had shown exercise-induced reversible perfusion defects, two occurred in areas that had shown fixed SESTAMIBI defects during exercise, and one occurred in a segment that had shown completely normal uptake during exercise. 
5	Maximal O2 uptake of in situ dog muscle during acute hypoxemia with constant perfusion. We investigated the relationships among maximal O2 uptake (VO2max), effluent venous PO2 (PvO2), and calculated mean capillary PO2 (PCO2) in isolated dog gastrocnemius in situ as arterial PO2 (PaO2) was progressively reduced with muscle blood flow held constant. The hypothesis that VO2max is determined in part by peripheral tissue O2 diffusion predicts proportional declines in VO2max and PCO2 if the diffusing capacity of the muscle remains constant. The inspired O2 fraction was altered in each of six dogs to produce four different levels of PaO2 [22 +/- 2, 29 +/- 1, 38 +/- 1, and 79 +/- 4 (SE) Torr]. Muscle blood flow, with the circulation isolated, was held constant at 122 +/- 15 ml.100 g-1.min-1 while the muscle worked maximally (isometric twitches at 5-7 Hz) at each of the four different values of PaO2. Arterial and venous samples were taken to measure lactate, pH, PO2, PCO2, and muscle VO2. PCO2 was calculated using Fick's law of diffusion and a Bohr integration procedure. VO2max fell progressively (P less than 0.01) with decreasing PaO2. The decline in VO2max was proportional (R = 0.99) to the fall in both muscle PvO2 and calculated PCO2 while the calculated muscle diffusing capacity was not different among the four conditions. Fatigue developed more rapidly with lower PaO2, although lactate output from the muscle was not different among conditions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that resistance to O2 diffusion in the peripheral tissue may be a principal determinant of VO2max. 
4	Blood rheology after cardiac valve replacement with mechanical prostheses or bioprostheses. Arterial thromboembolism is a serious complication in patients after heart valve replacement. Abnormalities in blood rheology may contribute to this complication. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare various determinants of blood rheology in patients with substitute heart valves with those in healthy controls; furthermore, differences between patients with mechanical valves and those with bioprostheses should be investigated. The hemorrheologic determinants--fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, hematocrit and platelet aggregation--were studied in 92 patients with mechanical bileaflet valves, in 28 patients with bioprostheses and in 29 control subjects; the time since valve replacement was greater than or equal to 9 months. Fibrinogen, plasma viscosity, red cell and spontaneous platelet aggregation were found to be increased in all patients after heart valve replacement compared with normal subjects (fibrinogen: 348 +/- 87 vs 267 +/- 66 mg/dl, p less than 0.01; plasma viscosity: 1.71 +/- 0.1 vs 1.66 +/- 0.1 mPas, p less than 0.05; red cell aggregation: 9.9 +/- 2 vs 7.8 +/- 2 U, p less than 0.01; platelet aggregation: 22 +/- 15 vs 13 +/- 13%, p less than 0.01); among patients, fibrinogen, plasma viscosity and spontaneous platelet aggregation were higher in mechanical valves than in bioprostheses (fibrinogen: 359 +/- 95 vs 314 +/- 41 mg/dl, p less than 0.01; plasma viscosity: 1.72 +/- 0.1 vs 1.68 +/- 0.1 mPas, p less than 0.1; platelet aggregation: 23 +/- 15 vs 16 +/- 11%; p less than 0.05), whereas no difference could be found for red cell aggregation (9.7 +/- 2 vs 10.5 +/- 2%, p greater than 0.05). 
3	Posterior transfer of the adductors in children who have cerebral palsy. A long-term study. Seventy-eight posterior transfers of the adductors of the hip in forty-two children who has spastic cerebral palsy were reviewed an average of 5.7 years after the operation (range, two to 14.6 years). The results were assessed on the basis of the patient's ability to walk, the range of motion of the affected hip or hips, and the radiographic measurements. In 88 per cent of the patients, the transfer was successful in improving or maintaining abduction, extension, functional walking, and stability of the hip. The failures were all in patients who were unable to walk and who had spastic quadriplegia. Tenotomy of the iliopsoas tendon at the time of the transfer procedure resulted in an improved range of motion of the hip. 
4	The placebo effect in heart failure. Many patients who are enrolled in controlled clinical trials of new drugs for the treatment of heart failure show favorable hemodynamic and clinical responses to placebo therapy. This "placebo effect" results from both the creation of a supportive therapeutic environment and the spontaneous improvement that is commonly seen when measurements of symptoms and cardiac function are repeated frequently over long intervals of time. Three months of treatment with a placebo produces a reduction in symptoms in 25% to 35% of patients, an increase in cardiac output and a decrease in pulmonary wedge pressure, and an increase in exercise tolerance of up to 90 to 120 seconds. Physicians commonly seek to maximize the "placebo effect," since the goal of treatment in the clinical setting is to improve the quality of the patient's life. On the other hand, clinical investigators seek to minimize the "placebo effect," since the goal of a research study is to test the hypothesis that the new drug is superior to a placebo. 
4	Effects of pressure and volume of the receiving chamber on the spatial distribution of regurgitant jets as imaged by color Doppler flow mapping. An in vitro study. Regurgitant jet dimensions imaged by color Doppler flow mapping have been used to evaluate the severity of valvular insufficiency in clinical studies. To study the effect of pressure and volume within the receiving chamber on the magnitude of spatial distribution of regurgitant jets assessed by color Doppler techniques, we designed a simple constant-flow model in which a jet was driven through a known orifice (1.5 mm2) into a compliant receiving chamber by a steady-flow pump. A distal tube at the outflow closed the system and maintained the volume of the chamber constant during pump operation. We varied flow rate from 60 to 270 ml/min into elastic balloons with different static compliances of 1, 2, 4.5, and 9 ml/mm Hg (pressures of 57, 28, 18, and 8 mm Hg, respectively); the balloons served as receiving chambers at the constant volume of 150 ml. We also evaluated the effect of different volumes of a receiving chamber (110, 130, and 150 ml and pressures of 5, 15, and 24 mm Hg) with a static compliance of 2 ml/mm Hg over the same range of flow rates. For each of the different balloons, jet area correlated linearly with the jet velocity across the orifice (r = 0.98, 0.99, 0.98, and 0.97) and also with flow rate (r = 0.97, 0.99, 0.98, and 0.99). At the same flow rate and volume of receiving chamber, however, the jet area imaged by color Doppler decreased as the pressure in the receiving chamber increased, although receiving-chamber volume was constant. 
4	Cardioprotective effects of carnitine in extensive aortocoronary bypass grafting: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The cardioprotective effects of carnitine were tested in patients undergoing multiple aortocoronary bypass grafting. Intermittent aortic cross-clamping at 28 degrees C was used. Mean total cross-clamping time was 30 +/- 11 min. Patients were randomized into three groups: a control group receiving placebo (group 1), a group pretreated with 3 g carnitine intravenously before cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (group 2), and a group pretreated with 6 g carnitine intravenously (group 3). The markers of myocardial ischemia included levels of adenosine triphosphate, its catabolites, and creatine phosphate in transmural left ventricular biopsy specimens taken at the beginning and end of CPB, as well as hemodynamic recovery during weaning from CPB and for the next 24 h. The intravenous infusion of carnitine (3 or 6 g) had no hemodynamic effect. At the end of CPB myocardial tissue levels of adenosine triphosphate and creatine phosphate did not differ significantly among the groups (P greater than 0.05). Recovery of cardiac function during weaning from CPB and for the following 24 h was similar in all three groups (P greater than 0.05). It is concluded that pretreatment with carnitine neither facilitates weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass in patients undergoing aortocoronary bypass surgery nor favorably affects hemodynamic function during the next 24 h. 
5	Peripheral arterial occlusive disease of the extremities in the United States: hospitalization and mortality. PAODE is an important cause of morbidity and health care expenditures among the elderly. Data from the NHDS and National Vital Statistics System were used to assess its impact in the U.S. In 1985 to 1987, an estimated 229 thousand men and 184 thousand women per year were discharged with any diagnosis of chronic PAODE. Discharge rates were much higher in men and increased sharply with age. Lower extremity arteriography was performed during 88 thousand hospitalizations and aorta-iliac-femoral bypass procedures were done during 31 thousand hospitalizations per year. Numbers of procedures increased markedly since 1979. An estimated 60 thousand men and 50 thousand women per year were discharged with any diagnosis of acute PAODE. Embolectomy or thrombectomy of lower limb arteries was listed for 28 thousand discharges per year. Few deaths were attributed to PAODE. Although these data are limited by likely incomplete reporting and by the nonspecificity of diagnostic codes, they provide an indication of the magnitude of the problem. An aging population and advances in surgical techniques suggest continued monitoring using multiple data sources. Vigorous primary prevention programs are needed to lessen the impact of all atherosclerotic diseases. 
5	Mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplantation: current status of total artificial heart in 1989 and determinants of survival. Since April 1986, 40 total artificial hearts (TAH) were implanted as a bridge to transplantation in our institution. In an attempt to identify factors affecting survival of TAH recipients we reviewed our experience over 1000 days of mechanical support. There was no postoperative bleeding requiring surgery nor were there any clinical episodes of thromboembolic complications. Over a total functioning period greater than 3 years there were no mechanical failures in the driving system but one artificial ventricle had to be replaced because of mechanical dysfunction. Infections and multiple organ failure were the primary causes of morbidity and mortality during mechanical support. When the patients who underwent staged transplantation (no. 17) were compared with those who died during mechanical support (no. 23) there were no differences in TAH driving mode or hemodynamic variables between the groups. Although preoperative pulmonary, hepatic and renal functions were found to be similar between the groups, there were significant differences in the early evolution (3 days) of hepatic and renal functions following TAH implant (p less than 0.01). Urinary output was found to be the earliest variable discriminating recovery and survival (p less than 0.01). Finally, univariate analysis indicated age (less than 40 vs greater than 40 years) and modality of cardiac decompensation (acute vs chronic) as the most important factors affecting survival after TAH implantation. Since young patients (less than 40 years of age) with acute decompensation were successfully transplanted in 82% of cases while 100% of older patients with chronic decompensation died before or after transplantation, TAH should be advised in young patients with acute or chronic heart failure and in selected older candidates with recent, acute cardiac failure. 
2	Effect of marked peripheral leukocytosis on the leukocyte count in ascites. Patients with high peripheral leukocyte counts are sometimes found to have high leukocyte counts in ascitic fluid in the presence of negative cultures. To determine if peripheral leukocytosis (greater than or equal to 20 x 10(9)/L) by itself can result in high leukocyte or neutrophil counts in ascites, 29 patients were studied. A total of 31 paracenteses were performed in these patients as soon as the high peripheral leukocyte count was determined. Culture of ascitic fluid was performed using blood-culture bottles. The mean peripheral leukocyte count was 29.3 +/- 9.3 x 10(9)/L, with a mean neutrophil count of 19.9 +/- 6.5 x 10(9)/L. The mean ascitic fluid neutrophil count was 0.064 +/- 0.054 x 10(9)/L (range, 0.007 to 0.197 x 10(9)/L). No significant correlation was found between peripheral neutrophil (or leukocyte) count and neutrophil (or leukocyte) count in ascitic fluid. Marked peripheral leukocytosis (or neutrophilia) does not seem to have an effect on the leukocyte or neutrophil count in ascitic fluid. 
4	Streptokinase treatment for femoral artery thrombosis after arterial cardiac catheterisation in infants and children. Data on 205 children who underwent retrograde arterial catheterisation were studied to assess the frequency of femoral artery thrombosis and the safety and efficacy of systemic streptokinase treatment for this complication. In 29 (14%) a transarterial balloon dilatation was performed. In 15 (7.3%) patients impaired arterial perfusion due to vascular spasm with or without thrombus formation was seen in the cannulated leg after catheterisation. Despite heparinisation, signs of impaired arterial circulation persisted in nine patients (4.4% of the total). In these patients femoral artery thrombosis was strongly suspected. Six (53%) of these had undergone a balloon dilatation. Therefore in this study the risk of femoral artery thrombosis developing was 12 times greater after transarterial balloon dilatation than after arterial catheterisation without dilatation (20.6% v 1.7%). Systemic infusion of streptokinase was started in all patients with femoral artery thrombosis. Arterial perfusion became normal in all patients, though in one this was delayed. Haematological monitoring showed lengthening of the thrombin time and a decrease of the fibrinogen concentration during streptokinase treatment. There were no serious complications. Systemic infusion of streptokinase is a safe and useful treatment in children with persistent femoral artery thrombosis after arterial cardiac catheterisation. 
1	Atheroemboli to the lower urinary tract: a marker of atherosclerotic vascular disease--a case report. Atheroemboli to the lower genitourinary tract may serve as a marker for disseminated atheroembolic disease, a highly lethal condition. A case presentation and review of our institional experience is presented. 
3	Long-term evaluation of hemiparkinsonian monkeys after adrenal autografting or cavitation alone. Autografts of adrenal medulla were implanted into preformed cavities in the caudate nuclei of four rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism induced by 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Five other hemiparkinsonian monkeys underwent caudate cavitation, but received no tissue implant. All of the animals had marked bradykinesia of the affected arm and stable apomorphine-induced turning before cavitation or implantation. Moderate behavioral recovery was seen in all five monkeys with cavitation and two of the three monkey with long-term adrenal autografts (the fourth adrenal recipient was sacrificed 10 days after grafting). The improvement occurred months after the procedure and was not as early or as complete as that seen after fetal dopaminergic grafts. Surviving adrenal tissue was found only in the animal that showed no behavioral recovery. The other two adrenal autograft recipients (with no surviving adrenal medulla) and all of the animals with cavitation had ingrowth of dopaminergic fibers from the area olfactoria and nucleus accumbens into the caudate, oriented toward the cavity. These findings show that the mechanism of improvement after adrenal medullary implants for parkinsonism is not dopamine secretion by chromaffin cells, but may be related to the sprouted host fibers. The results also indicate that the limited recovery after adrenal implants in parkinsonian patients may be a result of the cavitation, and not necessarily the result of tissue implantation. 
4	Skeletal muscle metabolism in heart failure: a 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy study of leg muscle. 1. The gastrocnemius muscle of seven patients with mild to moderate chronic heart failure and of five healthy control subjects was studied using 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Spectra were collected at rest and during an incremental, symptom-limited, exercise protocol. Blood flow was measured in the same study during brief interruptions to exercise. 2. The phosphocreatine/(phosphocreatine plus inorganic phosphate) ratio was lower in patients with heart failure than in control subjects at an exercise rate of 1.5 W, although intracellular pH and blood flow were similar. 3. The cytosolic free adenosine 5'-diphosphate concentration was markedly increased in patients with heart failure exercising at 1.5 W compared with control subjects exercising at the same workload. 4. Although the maximum workload achieved by patients with heart failure was less than half of that reached by control subjects, the pH and the phosphocreatine/(phosphocreatine plus inorganic phosphate) ratio were lower in patients with heart failure at maximal load. Blood flow was less at maximal exercise in patients with heart failure than in control subjects in keeping with the reduced work load. 5. The phosphocreatine depletion induced in the gastrocnemius muscle by exercise was more severe than previously described in the forearm of patients with heart failure. 6. Metabolic abnormalities in skeletal muscle may contribute to exercise intolerance in heart failure, particularly during submaximal exercise. 
3	Anatomical, physiological, and theoretical basis for the antiepileptic effect of vagus nerve stimulation. The vagus is a mixed nerve carrying somatic and visceral afferents and efferents. The majority of vagal nerve fibers are visceral afferents and have a wide distribution throughout the central nervous system (CNS) either monosynaptically or via the nucleus of the solitary tract. Besides activation of well-defined reflexes, vagal stimulation produces evoked potentials recorded from the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the thalamus, and the cerebellum. Activation of vagal afferents can depress monosynaptic reflexes, decrease the activity of spinothalamic neurons, and increase pain threshold. Depending on the stimulation parameters, vagal afferent stimulation in experimental animals can produce electroencephalographic (EEG) synchronization or desynchronization and has been shown to affect sleep states. The desychronization of the EEG appears to depend on activation of afferent fibers that have conduction velocities of less than or equal to 15 m/s. Vagal afferent stimulation can also influence the activity of interictal cortical spikes produced by topical strychnine application, and either attenuate or stop seizures produced by pentylenetetrazol, 3-mercaptoproprionic acid, maximal electroshock, and topical alumina gel. The mechanisms for the antiepileptic effects of vagal stimulation are not fully understood but probably relate to effects on the reticular activating system. The vagus provides an easily accessible, peripheral route to modulate CNS function. 
5	Measuring crackles. Crackles heard on auscultation can be represented graphically as a time-amplitude plot of the associated waveform. To assess the relative merits of several measures which might be considered for machine implementation in diagnostic instruments, we compared the reproducibility of those based on the initial voltage deflection which begins a crackle with those based on the largest deflection. The latter group showed less interobserver and less intraobserver variability when the same crackles were measured twice by each of two observers. Crackles from a teaching tape, categorized as fine and coarse, were used in this study. The ability of the various measures tested to distinguish between fine and coarse crackles on an individual basis was assessed and found to favor the measures based on the largest deflection. They showed an average of 9.96 percent incorrectly classified crackles, as opposed to 19.53 percent for the two measures based on the initial deflection. 
5	Microstaging of squamous cell carcinomas. The clinical classification of squamous cell carcinoma, which was established primarily by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC), does not permit optimal estimation of expected metastasis. The authors' results indicate that metastasis can be more accurately estimated on the basis of invasion depth, histopathologic grading, and especially tumor thickness. One essential advantage of these criteria is that they can be established by a histopathologist. It is interesting to note that in the authors' collective no carcinoma less than 2 mm thick metastasized, that is, a relatively high percentage of carcinomas (48%) can be graded as no-risk carcinomas. The risk of metastasis for undifferentiated carcinomas greater than 6 mm thick that have infiltrated the musculature, the perichondrium, or the periosteum, however, is quite high. Tumors between 2 and 6 mm thick with moderate differentiation and a depth of invasion that does not extend beyond the subcutis can be classified as low-risk carcinomas. 
4	Cardiorespiratory effects of endoscopic esophageal variceal sclerotherapy. Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is an effective means of controlling variceal hemorrhage, which develops as a consequence of portal hypertension. While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS. Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events. Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics. Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant. Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety. Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature. Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage. 
3	Transient ischaemic attacks in young patients: a thromboembolic or migrainous manifestation? A 10 year follow up study of 46 patients. Forty six patients aged 18-39 years with transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) were studied; two thirds were women. Twenty five patients had attacks accompanied by headache, and seven gave a history of common migraine. Only four of 27 angiograms were abnormal; no operable carotid lesion was demonstrated. Over a mean follow up period of 10 years stroke or myocardial infarction (AMI) occurred in all four patients who presented major cerebrovascular risk factors, but in only two of the remaining 42 patients. Thus irrespective of age thromboembolic TIA is a harbinger of stroke or AMI. However, most TIAs under the age of 40 years are caused by a non-embolic benign vascular disorder. The clinical characteristics, long-term prognosis, and possible pathogenesis, for such attacks are often indistinguishable from those of classical migraine. In the absence of cardiovascular risk factors, arteriography does not provide much diagnostic and prognostic information. 
2	CD8+ T cell homing to the pancreas in the nonobese diabetic mouse is CD4+ T cell-dependent. The adoptive transfer of type I diabetes in nonobese diabetic mice requires the contribution of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. To further elucidate the cellular pathway(s) of beta-cell destruction and the responsibility of each subset, high doses of committed T cells from diabetic mice purified to single subsets, were injected into syngeneic nonobese diabetic neonates. The recipients of single or mixed subsets were followed for clinical manifestations of diabetes and examined at 30 days of age for in situ lesions. None of the animals injected with either CD4+ or CD8+ T cells became overtly diabetic during the 30 days of observation whereas 8 of 23 mice inoculated with a mixture of the two subsets developed glycosuria and hyperglycemia. However, insulitis was found in 6 of the 13 mice injected with CD4+ T cells whereas only 1 of the 9 mice injected with CD8+ T cells showed marginal infiltration of the pancreas. The lesions initiated by CD4+ T cells alone were considerably less severe than those induced by the mixture of both subsets, corroborating the fact that overt disease did not occur in the former group. Together, these results suggest a distinct function for each diabetogenic T cell subset. CD4+ T cells, which have the capacity to home to the pancreas, promote in turn the influx of CD8+ effector T cells that do not by themselves accumulate in this organ. These results illustrate a novel form of T-T cell interactions leading to organ specific autoimmune lesions. 
1	Expression of c-erbB-2 gene product in urinary bladder cancer. Expression of the c-erbB-2 gene product and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) was investigated in 54 cases of human bladder cancer immunohistologically and by Western blot analysis. For detection of the c-erbB-2 product, two specific antibodies, a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed to the intracellular domain and a murine monoclonal antibody recognizing an epitope in the extracellular domain, were used. Seventeen cases of bladder cancer were stained by the anti-c-erbB-2 polyclonal antibody, while 20 cases were stained by the monoclonal antibody, with good correlation on both stainings (p less than 0.01). There were four c-erbB-2 positive cases in 26 G1 tumors, four in 15 G2 tumors, and nine in 13 G3 tumors. There were also eight erbB-2 positive cases in nine muscle-invasive tumors, nine of 45 superficial tumors, four of five with lymph node metastasis, and seven of 14 without metastasis, as revealed by staining with the polyclonal antibody. Thus, the c-erbB-2 gene product was more frequently expressed in high grade tumors (p less than 0.01), in high stage tumors (p less than 0.01), and nodal metastatic tumors (N.S. by Chi-square test). Twenty-two of the 54 tumors were stained by an anti-EGF-R monoclonal antibody, 528 IgG. The expression of EGF-R was independent of histological grading, tumor stage, and nodal status, and no correlation was observed between expression of the c-erbB-2 product and EGF-R. The c-erbB-2 product may be applicable as a tumor marker for evaluation of malignant potential, invasiveness, and probably metastatic potential of human bladder cancer. 
1	Mononuclear phagocytes: a major population of effector cells responsible for rejection of allografted tumor cells in mice. To understand the in situ mechanism of immunological response of recipient animals to allografted tumor cells, the types of cells that infiltrated into the rejection site were examined. When Meth A cells (H-2d) were given i.p. to an allogeneic [C57BL/6 (H-2b)] strain of mouse, the tumor cells ceased to grow on the 6th day, accompanied by an i.p. infiltration of leukocytes. The tumor cells were totally eliminated from the peritoneal cavity around the 12th day. The highest cytotoxic activity against Meth A cells was obtained with the peritoneal exudate cells harvested on day 8. On this day, the exudate cells consisted of three populations when examined by flow cytometry, and each was isolated by sorting. Each of them appeared to be homogeneous, and they were morphologically identified as lymphocytes; granulocytes; and medium-sized, mononuclear, less-granular cells. The cytotoxic activity was confined exclusively to the last population. The effector cells (H-2b) were cytotoxic against not only Meth A cells (H-2d) but also concanavalin A-stimulated allogeneic spleen cells [C3H/He (H-2k), CBA/N (H-2k), A/J (H-2a), BALB/c (H-2d), and DBA/2 (H-2d) strains of mouse]. The effector cells were totally inert against concanavalin A-activated syngeneic spleen cells [C57BL/6 (H-2b) and C57BL/10 (H-2b) strains of mouse]. The effector cells were phenotypically (Thy-1.2- CD3- Lyt-1- Lyt-2- L3T4- immunoglobulin- asialo GM1-), morphologically, and functionally distinct from cytotoxic T cells, natural killer cells, and lymphokine-activated killer cells but were adherent mononuclear phagocytes. 
5	Survey of the use of thrombolysis for acute limb ischaemia in the UK and Ireland. A total of 156 vascular surgeons from the UK and Ireland responded to a postal questionnaire on the use of thrombolysis in acute limb ischaemia. Almost half had used thrombolysis in the previous 12 months. Low dose intra-arterial streptokinase (89 per cent) was the regimen most frequently used, but 33 per cent had used intravenous streptokinase. Detailed results for 103 patients (limb salvage rate 60 per cent, amputation rate 35 per cent, mortality rate 5 per cent) were similar to those of previously published reports. Complications in most series were infrequent, but in the entire survey there were six bleeding-related deaths and one death from anaphylaxis. A total of 67 per cent of surgeons with working experience indicated that selected patients with acute arterial thromboses were most suitable for thrombolysis, particularly if there was no neurological deficit and no run-off for surgical bypass. Distal or late emboli and graft occlusions were regarded as appropriate by some surgeons. This study demonstrated that many vascular surgeons currently use thrombolysis, although sparingly and in selected cases. Patients with acute limb ischaemia should be managed by experienced vascular surgeons who are aware of the new therapeutic alternatives, an ideal supported by almost three-quarters of respondents to this survey. 
1	Malignant glandular triton tumor. A case of left brachial plexus-related malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor showing neoplastic, glandular, and rhabdomyoblastic elements in a 39-year-old Chinese man is reported. The authors suggested that this tumor be termed a malignant glandular triton tumor in view of the presence of the adenocarcinomatous component. The patient had extensive local recurrence comprising mainly the Schwann spindle cells within a year after complete piecemeal removal and died 15 months later after the initial presentation. The natural behavior of this tumor, as in other reported cases of malignant triton tumor, is extremely aggressive, unlike malignant schwannoma or glandular malignant schwannoma. The histogenesis of this tumor is likely to be from primitive neural crest cells, Schwann's cell precursors, or metaplastic malignant Schwann's cells. 
5	Rejection of multivisceral allografts in rats: a sequential analysis with comparison to isolated orthotopic small-bowel and liver grafts. Multivisceral isografts and allografts were transplanted to Lewis rats, and the histopathologic changes were studied in the liver, intestine, and other constituent organs. Rats receiving isografts had indefinite survival with maintenance of weight. With multivisceral allografts (from Brown-Norway donors), the intestinal component was rejected more severely than the companion liver and with about the same severity as when intestinal transplantation was performed alone. Intestinal rejection in either circumstance was a lethal event, causing death in 10 to 12 days. The earliest (by day 4) and most intense cellular rejection was in the Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes. This was associated with or followed by cryptitis, epithelial cell necrosis, focal abscess formation, mural necrosis, and eventual perforation. Liver allografts transplanted alone or as part of multivisceral grafts also had histopathologic evidence of rejection, but this was self-limiting and spontaneously reversible when the liver was transplanted alone. Thus the Achille's heel of multivisceral grafts is the intestinal component that is not protected by the presence of the liver in the organ complex. Better immunosuppression should permit successful experimental and clinical transplantation of such grafts. 
4	Efficacy of nimodipine in cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage. Our studies showed that in an appropriate dose, nimodipine increased local cerebral blood flow with no corresponding increase in local metabolism. Nimodipine treatment given before experimental ischemic insult, resulting from either vascular occlusion or intracranial hemorrhage or after subarachnoid hemorrhage, maintained or improved blood flow and minimized the severity of subsequent brain damage. Lack of benefit from nimodipine treatment after the insult may occur because the inexorable progression of events leading to ischemic neuronal damage, once initiated, cannot be arrested. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic factors may be important, and post-treatment efficacy may depend on administration protocols that achieve an adequate concentration in ischemic tissue sufficiently soon after an insult. Our findings are compatible with the benefit of nimodipine being due to an improvement in blood flow that reduces the severity of ischemia. However, they do not exclude the possibility that treatment may minimize the accumulation of calcium in damaged cells as a result of "cytoprotective" effects. 
5	Effect of nontransmural necrosis on epicardial potential fields. Correlation with fiber direction. The effect of nontransmural necrosis on epicardial potential distributions was studied in 13 dogs. In previous studies, left ventricular epicardial pacing generated epicardial potential maps at QRS onset with a negative central area and two positive areas that faced the portions of the wavefront propagating along fibers. Subsequently, the positive areas expanded in a counterclockwise direction by 90 degrees to 120 degrees. In those studies, the rotatory expansion of the positive areas was tentatively attributed to the spread of excitation through deep myocardial layers, where fiber direction rotated counterclockwise from epicardium to endocardium. To test this hypothesis, we tried to interrupt the counterclockwise expansion of the positive area by creating localized, nontransmural necrosis at various depths in the left ventricular wall by injection of formalin or application of laser energy. Epicardial potential maps were obtained from a grid of 12 x 15 electrodes on a 44 x 56-mm area. Epicardial pacing from selected sites generated epicardial maps in which some positive areas were missing compared with controls. The direction of the straight line joining the pacing site to the site of missing positivity correlated well with the average fiber direction in the necrotic mass (r = 0.82, p less than 0.01). Angle between epicardial fiber direction and the straight line described above correlated well with the average depth of the necrosis, expressed as percent of the wall thickness (r = 0.95, p less than 0.01). These data support the hypothesis that the counterclockwise expansion of the epicardial positivity occurring after epicardial pacing results from excitation spreading along deep fibers. 
1	Peripheral ameloblastoma with clear cell differentiation. This report details a case of mandibular peripheral ameloblastoma having a clear cell component. The latter consisted of ovoid cells with vacuolated or clear cytoplasm and vesicular or pyknotic nuclei that may be disposed as discrete clusters or show direct transition from typical acanthomatous areas. Comparison of this lesion with other odontogenic and nonodontogenic tumors that contain clear cells is discussed in the context of the differential diagnosis. 
3	Posttraumatic torticollis. We report six cases of torticollis precipitated by neck trauma. The dystonia began 1 to 4 days after the trauma and differed clinically from idiopathic torticollis by marked limitation of range of motion, lack of improvement after sleep ("honeymoon period"), and absence of geste antagonistique. Worsening with action was not present; nor was there improvement with support as seen with idiopathic torticollis. Onset of pain immediately after the trauma and marked spasms of the paracervical muscles were other predominant features. Anticholinergic therapy was without benefit; however, some improvement occurred with botulinum toxin injection. It is concluded that torticollis can be caused by peripheral trauma and that it has unique clinical characteristics. 
1	Bone cancer incidence rates in New York State: time trends and fluoridated drinking water. BACKGROUND: Recent animal studies of the potential carcinogenicity of fluoride prompted an examination of bone cancer incidence rates. METHODS: Trends in the incidence of primary bone cancers, including the incidence of osteosarcomas were examined among residents of New York State, exclusive of New York City. Average annual osteosarcoma incidence rates in fluoridated and non-fluoridated areas were also compared. RESULTS: Among persons less than 30 years of age at diagnosis, bone cancer incidence among males demonstrated a significant increase since 1955, while incidence among females has remained unchanged. A significant decrease in bone cancer incidence rates since 1955 was observed among both males and females age 30 years and over at time of diagnosis. Osteosarcoma incidence rates have remained essentially unchanged since 1970, among both younger and older males and females. The average annual age adjusted incidence of osteosarcomas (1976-1987) in areas served by fluoridated water supplies was not found to differ from osteosarcoma incidence rates in non-fluoridated areas. CONCLUSIONS: These data do not support an association between fluoride in drinking water and the occurrence of cancer of the bone. 
4	Hepatic lesions in the rabbit induced by acoustic cavitation. Tissue damage during shock-wave lithotripsy is presumably secondary to cavitation phenomena involving the collapsus of gas bubbles in a fluid. To enhance shock-wave-related hepatic lesions, intravascular gas microbubbles were administered. Three groups of eight rabbits each received either 500 shock waves focused on the right hepatic lobe (group 1), gas microbubbles as a mixture of 50 cm3 of air with 50 cm3 of gelatin infused through an arterial catheter (group 2), or 500 shock waves and gas microbubbles simultaneously (group 3). In group 1, two animals had two to three subcapsular hepatic hematomas (diameter, less than 5 mm) and five had one to five intraparenchymal hematomas (less than 1 mm). In group 2, a moderate liver congestion was observed in three animals. In group 3, all animals had numerous subcapsular and intraperenchymal hematomas (2-30 mm). The hematomas were centered around the portal spaces, associated with lacunae (0.5-5 mm in diameter). Hematomas were also present on the anterior wall of intraabdominal organs. It was concluded that intravascular infusion of gas microbubbles into the path of a shock-wave generator dramatically enhances tissue damage. This technique, potentially useful in the treatment of hepatic tumors, needs refinement to confine lesions in a more uniform pattern to the targeted parenchyma. 
5	Hyperadrenergic orthostatic intolerance as a result of postpartum blood loss. This article describes a young women in whom orthostatic intolerance developed as a result of protracted postpartum vaginal bleeding. The cardiovascular abnormalities were unresponsive to usual treatment measures, and she required combination therapy directed at increasing plasma volume and decreasing sympathetic nervous system activity. After resolution of her symptoms, the patient required no long-term therapy. Chronic blood loss has not been reported as a cause of this syndrome. 
4	Acute coronary artery occlusion during and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. Frequency, prediction, clinical course, management, and follow-up [published erratum appears in Circulation 1991 Jul;84(1):446] BACKGROUND. Acute coronary artery occlusion after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) continues to remain a serious complication despite significant improvement in operator performance and technological advancements. This retrospective study was performed to ascertain the frequency, predictive variables, management, and outcome of acute coronary artery occlusion. METHODS AND RESULTS. The study was based on data from 1,423 consecutive patients who underwent an elective coronary angioplasty between January 1986 and December 1988. Acute coronary artery occlusion occurred in 104 patients (7.3%). Acute occlusion developed during the dilatation procedure in 80 patients (5.6%) and within 24 hours after the procedure in 24 patients (1.7%). Four clinical and 14 angiographic variables predictive for acute coronary artery occlusion were analyzed in these 104 patients with a complicated procedure and were compared with those in 104 representative patients with successful attempts. Multivariate analysis found three independent predictive variables: unstable angina, multivessel disease, and complex lesions. The overall clinical outcome after management of acute coronary artery occlusion including immediate repeat dilatation (95 patients), use of intracoronary streptokinase (34 patients), or autoperfusion catheter (12 patients) was successful (reduction of lumen diameter to less than 50%, no death, no myocardial infarction [MI], and no emergency surgery) in 42 patients (40%), was a failure without major complication in four patients (4%), and was a failure with major complication (death, MI, and emergency surgery) in 58 patients (56%). The overall mortality rate was 6% (six patients), the overall MI rate was 36% (37 patients), and emergency bypass surgery was required in 30% of patients (31 patients). At 6 months' follow-up of 42 patients with successful management, recurrent angina pectoris due to restenosis occurred in 10 patients (24%), and a late MI occurred in one patient (3%). At 6 months' follow-up of 56 survivors with unsuccessful management (development of MI or need for emergency bypass surgery), recurrent angina occurred in nine patients (16%), and cardiac death in two patients (4%). However, the majority of patients in both groups were either symptom free or had mild angina pectoris. CONCLUSION. Acute coronary artery occlusion during PTCA is often unpredictable, but its frequency is higher in patients with unstable angina, multivessel disease, and complex lesions. Despite immediate redilatation, use of intracoronary streptokinase, and emergency bypass surgery, PTCA is associated with a high mortality and morbidity. 
1	A case of classical mycosis fungoides associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I. A 72-year-old male patient from north-eastern Iran developed the typical clinical and histopathological features of mycosis fungoides with lymphadenopathy, but without any other systemic involvement. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) antibodies were detected in the patient's serum by two different ELISAs and by Western blot using purified viral particles from MT-2 culture supernatants. Cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes were positive for labelling with anti-HTLV-I serum. Southern blot hybridization of DNA extracted from a skin tumour and from an involved lymph node revealed integrated proviral DNA with identical restriction patterns. This case supports a relationship between mycosis fungoides and HTLV-I and may indicate a new region of endemic HTLV-I infection. 
5	Analysis of antigen expression at multiple tumor sites in epithelial ovarian cancer. The question of whether the antigenic phenotype of human epithelial ovarian cancer varies in a given patient between the primary tumor and metastatic sites or among metastatic sites themselves is an important issue in planning potential therapeutic strategies for ovarian cancer. We have obtained tumor specimens from at least two separate sites during operations on 12 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, and we have typed these specimens with a group of 18 monoclonal antibodies that react with cell-surface glycoprotein and carbohydrate antigens, including blood group antigens. Antibodies with relative specificity for malignant cells as well as those that detect more widely distributed epithelial antigens were used. A total of 31 specimens from 12 patients with advanced adenocarcinoma (8 serous, 3 undifferentiated, 1 endometrioid) of the ovary were studied, including fresh ascites cells in two patients. Frozen sections of tumor specimens were stained with the antibodies by the indirect immunoperoxidase technique and graded semiquantitatively. Little difference was seen in antigenic expression of tumors that were obtained from various sites in the same patient for either the epithelial cell markers or blood group markers. Intratumoral antigenic heterogeneity was seen, but this was generally quite consistent within a given patient's specimens. As anticipated, variations in antigen expression were seen among specimens from different patients. The antigenic phenotype of the tumor specimens in a given patient, as determined immunohistochemically by our group of antibodies, showed only minor variation among primary and metastatic sites. 
5	Decrease in mean platelet survival time in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN). In an attempt to study further the possible participation of platelets in the pathogenesis of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), we studied the platelet survival time, as an index of platelet activation, in 22 patients with APSGN. Mean platelet survival time was computed from the disappearance of radioactivity from blood, sampled serially after injection of autologous 51Cr-labelled platelets. C1q solid phase ELISA and conglutinin (K) solid phase ELISA were used to measure the serum levels of immune complexes. The platelet survival time in APSGN patients was 113 +/- 10 h vs 197 +/- 10 h in the control group (p less than 0.001); 68% of the patients had a shortened platelet survival, lower than 95% confidence limit. There was a significant increase in the platelet survival in the six patients that were studied after recovery from acute nephritic syndrome. There was no significant association between the mean platelet times survival and CICs (circulating immune complexes). Similarly, no significant correlation was found between the mean platelet lifespan and the severity of the glomerular disease, as assessed by the serum creatinine level and the proteinuria. These results support evidence of platelet activation and consumption in APSGN and we suggest that this activation occurs in the glomeruli capillary wall, due to platelet-vascular wall interaction. 
3	Brain water content, brain blood volume, blood chemistry, and pathology in a model of cerebral edema. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The objective was to correlate regional changes during brain water content with alterations in blood chemistry and cerebral pathology during hypo-osmotic edema. PARTICIPANTS: Sprague-Dawley male adult rats were used in these studies. DESIGN: Animals were block-randomized to receive either an intraperitoneal distilled water injection equivalent to 5% or 15% of their body weight or no injection (controls). Rats were sacrificed 15 or 60 minutes after water injection or at an equivalent time for controls. INTERVENTIONS: No interventions were performed. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Water content of cerebral cortical gray and white matter was calculated from measurements of tissue specific gravity. Blood plasma osmolality and sodium and potassium concentrations were determined at various times after water injection. An index of blood-brain barrier permeability was obtained by measuring brain red blood cell and plasma volumes. A qualitative assessment of edema was made from light and electron micrographs of the cerebral cortex. We found that water injection produced a dose-dependent decrease in plasma osmolality and sodium concentration within 15 minutes. Cortical water content was unchanged after this period. An influx of water into cerebral gray, and, less readily, into cerebral white matter occurred during the next 15 minutes. Whole blood specific gravity and brain blood content were unchanged and thus did not confound the measurement of cerebral water content. Hematocrit was increased 60 minutes after a 15% water injection. The blood-brain barrier remained intact throughout this period. Microscopy revealed astrocytic swelling with slight extracellular fluid accumulation 60 minutes after the water injection. CONCLUSIONS: Homeostatic mechanisms in the cerebral cortex can maintain constant water content for at least 15 minutes during maintained intravascular hypo-osmolality. Fluid that subsequently moves into the tissue primarily enters an intracellular compartment. This model will be useful in investigating physiological mechanisms of brain water regulation and the pathogenesis of brain edema, a common clinical entity in emergency conditions. 
4	Prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 mediate reduction of increased mean arterial pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass by aspiration of shed pulmonary venous blood. Increased mean arterial pressure during the aortic crossclamp period while on cardiopulmonary bypass was usually treated by us with hypotensive drugs. We noticed, however, that aspirating shed excess pulmonary venous blood from the open pleural cavities causes an immediate reduction in mean arterial pressure, obviating the need for any further pharmaceutical intervention. In this study we investigated the relationship between the reduction in mean arterial pressure and the levels of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2 in the peripheral and pulmonary venous blood. Ten men undergoing coronary bypass operations had 21 episodes of increased mean arterial pressure (106.9 +/- 11.4 mm Hg) during aortic crossclamping, which was reduced to 67.4 +/- 11.4 mm Hg (p less than 0.001) only by aspirating a mean of 490 ml (range 150 to 1100 ml) of pulmonary venous blood from the pleurae back into the circulation. Mean peripheral prostacyclin level, measured as 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha, and prostaglandin E2 level, both measured by radioimmunoassay technique, were significantly lower at peak mean arterial pressure (419 +/- 180 and 59.5 +/- 21.2 pg/ml) than at lowest mean arterial pressure (632 +/- 271 and 96.7 +/- 52.4 pg/ml for 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2, respectively; p less than 0.001). Prostaglandin F1 alpha and prostaglandin E2 levels in the aspirated pulmonary venous blood were 2309 +/- 3098 pg/ml and 749 +/- 909 pg/ml, respectively. The hypotensive effect of shed pulmonary venous blood that is aspirated back from the pleurae into the circulation seems to be mediated by the high levels of prostacyclin and prostaglandin E2, both powerful vasodilators. 
1	Desmoplastic variant of ameloblastoma: report of a case and review of the literature. A case of desmoplastic variant of ameloblastoma is reported. The lesion, in a 36-year-old Japanese woman, was successfully treated by partial maxillectomy. Reconstruction was carried out with a block of hydroxyapatite about 7 years and 6 months later. Six cases, including our case, reported up to the present are summarized and reviewed. 
5	Comparison of coffee intake and coffee-induced symptoms in patients with duodenal ulcer, nonulcer dyspepsia, and normal controls. Coffee and decaffeinated coffee stimulate acid secretion. In addition, many patients experience dyspepsia after coffee ingestion. Therefore, coffee is often prohibited by physicians in patients with peptic diseases. However, the association between peptic disease and symptoms remains unclear. This study compares coffee intake and the induction of symptoms by coffee in patients with duodenal ulcer disease, nonulcer dyspepsia, and normal controls. We have studied the coffee drinking habits of 58 duodenal ulcer patients, 55 nonulcer dyspepsia patients, and 55 normal controls. The use of coffee on a daily basis was not significantly different between duodenal ulcer patients (64%) and controls (56%), or between nonulcer dyspepsia patients (55%) and controls. There was also no difference between the three groups in the use of decaffeinated coffee, the number of cups per day, the method of preparation, the length of time of coffee use, or any change in coffee intake in the previous year. The intake of tea, caffeinated carbonated beverages, and aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was also similar in the three groups. The duodenal ulcer patients were more likely to be cigarette smokers (45%) than either the controls (16%) or the nonulcer dyspepsia patients (24%). Daily alcohol intake was not significantly different in the three groups. The prevalence of coffee induction of dyspeptic symptoms was similar in duodenal ulcer patients (29%) and controls (22%), but was much more common in nonulcer dyspepsia patients (53%) than in controls (22%), p = 0.0036. In conclusion, there was no difference in coffee intake between patients with duodenal ulcer, nonulcer dyspepsia, or normal controls. However, patients with nonulcer dyspepsia, but not duodenal ulcer, were more likely to experience dyspeptic symptoms after coffee ingestion. 
1	An evaluation of the distinction of ectopic and pituitary ACTH dependent Cushing's syndrome by clinical features, biochemical tests and radiological findings. The efficiency of various laboratory and radiological investigations in the differentiation of ectopic from pituitary dependent Cushing's syndrome was studied, based on findings in 23 patients with verified Cushing's disease and seven patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome. Clinical features strongly favouring the ectopic type were male sex and history for less than 18 months. Basal biochemical features strongly indicating the ectopic syndrome included plasma K+ less than 3.0 mmol/l and HCO3 greater than 30 mmol/l; serum cortisol at 9 a.m. or midnight of greater than 800 nmol/l; urine free cortisol greater than 1300 nmol/24 hours; plasma ACTH greater than 100 ng/l. In the high-dose dexamethasone suppression test, suppression by less than 50 per cent of 9 a.m. serum cortisol, urine free cortisol or 17-oxogenic steroids was usually indicative of an ectopic source of ACTH. A mean suppressed value of greater than 450 nmol/l for the 9 a.m. and midnight cortisol combined occurred in all of those with the ectopic syndrome, but in none of the 23 patients with Cushing's disease. For urine free cortisol, a mean suppressed value of less than 1000 nmol/24 hours was found in all patients with Cushing's disease, but in none of those in the ectopic group. In the metyrapone test, there was an increase of less than or equal to 3-fold in 11-deoxycortisol at 24 hours in patients with ectopic ACTH; the increase was greater than 3-fold in all but one of the patients with Cushing's disease. Failure to respond to either dexamethasone or metyrapone was found in only one of the patients with Cushing's disease (Patient 16); in the ectopic group, all patients except Patient D failed to respond to either test. It is concluded that patients presenting with clinically obvious Cushing's syndrome along with measurable plasma ACTH can be reliably divided by conventional tests into those that are driven from the pituitary and those driven by ectopic ACTH. 
4	Comparison of standard one-minute treadmill exercise and strandness test (absolute walking distance) in relation to site of lesion, walking distance, and diastolic blood flow velocity (Doppler curves). In 215 outpatients suffering from occlusive arterial disease of the lower limbs the authors compared the decrease in the ratio of ankle systolic pressure to brachial systolic pressure according to whether the treadmill exercise was limited to one minute or extended until pain forced the patient to stop. After a one-minute walk the pressure index always decreased significantly, especially when walking was restricted. The decrease in the pressure index was generally greater when the exercise was continued until the absolute walking distance, and the recovery time was usually twice as long. The fall in the pressure index was significantly greater for patients with single and multiple iliac stenoses than for those with stenoses at lower levels. In patients having a diastolic blood flow velocity on Doppler curves at rest, not modified by walking, a maximum drop in peripheral pressure was recorded after walking for one minute. In this instance there was no intensification of the decrease in peripheral pressure, unlike in patients without a diastolic blood flow velocity at rest. This one-minute test is not a maximal hemodynamic response, but it is sufficient for the appreciation of ischemia during exercise, according to the different parameters measured. 
1	Control of interleukin-1 beta expression by protein kinase C and cyclic adenosine monophosphate in myeloid leukemia cells. We have examined the signal transduction pathways leading to the expression of the interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) gene in human myeloid leukemia cells lines. Two cell lines representing different stages of differentiation were used (HL-60, promyelocytic, and THP-1, mature monocytic). In accordance with previous studies, it was observed that a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), was a sufficient stimulus for induction of the IL-1 beta messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and IL-1 beta protein production in both of these cell lines. A structural analog of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dbcAMP) or agents elevating the endogenous cAMP levels (prostaglandin E2, forskolin) were not alone able to induce IL-1 beta expression, but they strongly enhanced the PMA-induced IL-1 beta production and IL-1 beta mRNA accumulation. Nuclear run off analysis showed that this elevation in IL-1 beta mRNA levels was due to an increased rate of transcription. If dbcAMP was added 6 hours before PMA to the cultures, no enhancement in the IL-1 beta production was seen, implying that for this enhancing effect both of these signals must be present simultaneously. PKC inhibitor, H7, also blocked effectively the PMA plus dbcAMP induced IL-1 beta production, while the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, HA1004, had no effect, suggesting that PKA activation is not involved in the mechanism of action of cAMP in this case. Collectively, the present findings show that cAMP-dependent signals can have a positive regulatory effect on the PKC-dependent activation of the IL-1 beta gene in cells derived from different stages of myeloid differentiation. 
5	Torulopsis glabrata vaginitis: clinical aspects and susceptibility to antifungal agents. Torulopsis glabrata is second only to Candida albicans in frequency of isolation from the vagina in both asymptomatic women and patients with yeast vaginitis. We retrospectively studied 33 patients from whom vaginal isolates of T glabrata were obtained. Torulopsis glabrata caused symptomatic vaginitis in 42% of the patients but was unassociated with symptoms in 30%; in 27% of patients, its importance was uncertain because of concomitant pathology. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed on 39 T glabrata strains isolated from 39 patients. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the majority of T glabrata isolates fell within the sensitive range of the antimycotic drugs tested; however, no correlation was found between in vitro antifungal MICs and the response to azole drug therapy. Clinical success was achieved in 67% of the patients although mycologic cure occurred in only 33%. A small number of patients developed recurrent and often chronic Torulopsis vaginitis unresponsive to conventional therapy. Limited experience suggests that vaginal boric acid therapy may be of value in these recalcitrant cases. 
1	Treatment of advanced neuroblastoma with emphasis on intensive induction chemotherapy. A report from the Study Group of Japan. One hundred nine newly treated patients with advanced neuroblastoma were entered in this study between January 1985 and May 1989. The eligible patients included infants younger than 12 months of age with Stage IVA disease (bone cortex, distant lymph node, and/or remote organ metastases) and patients aged 12 months or older with Stage III or IV disease (IVA plus IVB with tumor crossing the mid-line and with metastases confined to bone marrow, liver, and skin). The patients first received six cyclic course of intensive chemotherapy (regimen A1), consisting of cyclophosphamide (1200 mg/m2), vincristine (1.5 mg/m2), tetrahydropyranyl adriamycin (pyrarubicin; 40 mg/m2), and cisplatin (90 mg/m2). Original tumors and the regional lymph node metastases were removed some time during these first six cycles of chemotherapy. The patients were further divided into three groups. Patients in course 1 received alternating treatment by regimen B (cyclophosphamide and ACNU) and intensified regimen A1, and those in course 2 were treated with alternating administration of regimen C (cyclophosphamide and DTIC) and intensified A1. Patients in course 3 were treated with bone marrow transplantation (BMT) preceded by high-dose preconditioning chemotherapy. Survival rates were 77% in Stage III and 54% in Stage IV at 2 years, and 70% in Stage III and 45% in Stage IV at 3 years. The major toxicities encountered were bone marrow suppression with leukocyte counts down to 100/mm3, mild cystitis, and hearing impairment. The 2-year survival rate was 78% in 21 patients who underwent BMT when complete remission was achieved. We concluded that our intensive induction chemotherapy is of significant value in increasing the rate of complete response, and in widening the indications for and achieving improved results of treatment with BMT. 
3	Radiation-induced cranial nerve palsy: hypoglossal nerve and vocal cord palsies. Cranial nerve palsies are an unexpected complication of radiotherapy for head and neck tumours. We present a case of this radiation-induced cranial palsy. An 18-year-old female with nasopharyngeal carcinoma developed a right hypoglossal nerve palsy 42 months after cancericidal doses of radiotherapy. In addition, she developed a bilateral vocal cord palsy 62 months after therapy. Follow-up over four years has demonstrated no evidence of tumour recurrence and no sign of neurological improvement. 
5	Choroid plexus tumors in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. Choroid plexus neoplasms are rare epithelial tumors of the central nervous system. A carcinoma of the choroid plexus occurred in a child from a family with the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome (Li-Fraumeni or SBLA syndrome), an inherited condition characterized by the development of diverse neoplasms (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma, and others). Choroid plexus carcinomas were identified in two kindreds previously reported with the syndrome. The literature contains reports of choroid plexus neoplasms occurring in families and in individuals with multiple primary tumors. Choroid plexus neoplasm may be a manifestation of the inherited proclivity to tumor development in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome. 
5	The Baltimore experience with laparoscopic management of acute cholecystitis. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has rapidly emerged as a popular alternative to traditional laparotomy and cholecystectomy. Acute cholecystitis has been considered to be a relative or absolute contraindication to laparoscopic surgery. After gaining extensive experience in laparoscopic biliary tract surgery, this procedure was attempted in 15 patients with acute cholecystitis. All patients were operated on within 72 hours of admission. In five patients, the laparoscopic procedure was converted to an open laparotomy; in one patient, a localized abscess was found, and in the other four patients, extensive inflammation and edema precluded a safe dissection of the vascular and ductal structures. Laparoscopic cholangiography was performed in 14 patients and proved valuable in demonstrating the ductal anatomy. Patients were discharged an average of 2.7 days after the laparoscopic procedure. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy may be safely performed by experienced surgeons in patients with acute cholecystitis. To ensure a low complication rate, a low threshold for converting the procedure to an open laparotomy must be maintained if the ductal and vascular anatomy cannot be safely demonstrated. 
4	Senile cardiac amyloidosis associated with homozygosity for a transthyretin variant (ILE-122). Senile cardiac amyloidosis, also known as senile systemic amyloidosis, is a sporadic disease of late onset but with increasing incidence with age. Recently it has been shown in one case that amyloid deposits contained a transthyretin variant with an isoleucine for valine substitution at position 122. A second case with the transthyretin isoleucine 122 variant is reported here. This individual, who died with restrictive cardiomyopathy, was found to be homozygous for this transthyretin variant and his son heterozygous for the variant. A brother of the propositus was also homozygous for the variant but died of a cerebral vascular accident without being evaluated for amyloidosis. These studies show genetic transmission of the isoleucine-122 transthyretin variant associated with this form of cardiac amyloidosis. 
2	Gastrointestinal intraluminal pH in normal subjects and those with colorectal adenoma or carcinoma. Recent evidence suggests that the production of colorectal carcinogens is facilitated when the pH of the colonic contents is alkaline. It follows that the colonic intraluminal pH of patients with colorectal neoplasms should be higher than in normal subjects. Gastrointestinal pH has been measured in 30 patients with colorectal cancer and 37 patients with benign colorectal adenomas (using a pH sensitive radiotelemetry capsule). These values have been compared with those recorded in 66 normal subjects. No differences in gastrointestinal pH were found and the results did not support the hypothesis that colonic pH plays a role in the aetiology of colorectal neoplasia. 
1	Use of the levator scapulae muscle flap in head and neck reconstruction. There are numerous techniques available for reconstruction of defects following composite resection of oral cavity and oropharyngeal tumors. No single technique is applicable in all situations. The levator scapulae muscle flap is well known for its application in carotid protection. Little attention is paid to its usefulness in other aspects of head and neck reconstruction. We have been using the levator scapulae muscle flap for a variety of reconstructive problems. The flap is useful for buttressing intraoral suture lines, closing intraoral defects, and providing soft tissue to fill in dead spaces and bulk out lateral and anterior oral defects. The levator flap was found to be easy to elevate, safe, and reliable with a minimum of wound complications. A review of 18 patients, representative case studies, and a discussion of surgical technique and relevant anatomy and blood supply is presented. 
4	Heart weights of white men 20 to 39 years of age. An analysis of 218 autopsy cases. Review of autopsy data for 218 white men between 20 and 39 years of age who died of injuries or suddenly and unexpectedly indicated a mean heart weight of 371 g. The mean for those dying of external causes was 364 g whereas the mean for those dying of natural causes was 446 g. A coefficient for heart weight expressed as a percentage of body weight was lower in heavy individuals than lightweight individuals; it ranged between 0.38% and 0.55%, with a mean of 0.48%. Heart weight, including epicardial fat, increased with age and body weight. These data may be useful to those who are called upon to investigate sudden and unexpected deaths. 
1	Myofibroblastoma of the tongue. An immunohistochemical, ultrastructural, and flow cytometric study. A case of myofibroblastoma arising in the tongue of a 77-year-old man is described. The patient presented with a submucosal tongue mass without other associated symptoms. The tumor was 2 cm in diameter, well circumscribed, and composed of uniform spindle cells arranged in fascicles. Electron microscopic examination and immunohistochemistry demonstrated a myofibroblastic origin for the tumor cells. DNA flow cytometric analysis showed a diploid DNA content of this tumor. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of myofibroblastoma occurring in the tongue. 
5	Postoperative sore throat: topical hydrocortisone Forty patients undergoing tracheal intubation and controlled ventilation of the lungs for elective surgical procedures were studied. They were allocated randomly into one of two groups. The tracheal tubes used for group A patients were lubricated before insertion with water-soluble 1% hydrocortisone cream. Those for group B patients were lubricated with KY jelly. The incidence of postoperative sore throat was found to be significantly greater in group A. Topical 1% hydrocortisone cream is therefore ineffective in the prevention of postoperative sore throat. 
2	Diagnostic fine-needle puncture of the gallbladder with US guidance From February 1988 to January 1990, 118 fine-needle diagnostic punctures of the gallbladder (DPG) were performed under continuous ultrasound (US) guidance on symptomatic patients with gallstones. The first attempt at gallbladder puncture and aspiration was successful in every patient with use of a 22-gauge needle and continuous US visualization of the needle tip. The aspirated volume varied between 3 and 88 mL (average +/- standard deviation, 25.0 mL +/- 15.3). Biliary analysis revealed an elevation of the cholesterol saturation index in patients with cholesterol gallstones (attenuation at computed tomographic examination of 50 HU or less) relative to that in patients with pigment stones (attenuation more than 50 HU) (1.3 +/- 0.2 vs 1.0 +/- 0.1, P less than .05). The nucleation time was prolonged in patients with pigment stones (19.3 days +/- 3.5 vs 1.8 days +/- 0.8 for patients with cholesterol stones, P less than .001). All patients remained hospitalized for 24 hours after DPG and were reexamined on an outpatient basis at 1 and 3 months thereafter. No complications were detected during either short-term observation or long-term follow-up. The authors conclude that DPG is a safe and valuable technique in the diagnostic work-up of gallstone patients to establish their suitability for nonoperative treatment. 
5	Morbidity and disability in older persons in the years prior to death. BACKGROUND: A large proportion of the disease and disability which affects older persons occurs in the years just prior to death. Little prospective evidence is available which quantifies the burden of morbidity and disability during these years. METHODS: In three community-based cohorts of persons age 65 and older, chronic conditions and disability were evaluated for the three years prior to death in 531 persons who had three annual assessments and then died within one year of the third assessment. Number of chronic conditions, prevalence of disability in activities of daily living (ADLs), and prevalence of disability on a modified Rosow-Breslau scale were determined for these decedents and compared to 8821 members of the cohorts known to have survived. RESULTS: Prevalence rates of disease and disability increased during the follow-up for both decedents and survivors, with decedents generally having higher rates than survivors. Disability rates prior to death, but not the number of diseases, increased with increasing age at death. The odds ratio for disability in ADLs at any of the three assessments for decedents versus survivors ranged from 3.0 to 4.2 in the three communities. In each community the odds ratio for ADL disability was higher in women decedents versus survivors than in men decedents versus survivors. CONCLUSIONS: These results have important implications for disability levels in future older populations in which death is projected to occur at increasingly higher ages. 
3	The association of carotid artery stenosis with carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Transitory cerebral ischaemic attack provoked by carotid sinus reflex The association of internal carotid stenosis with the carotid sinus syndrome represents a special clinical entity. Transitory cerebral ischaemic attack (TIA) will usually be manifested by activation of carotid sinus reflex. Eighteen patients were observed suffering from both carotid sinus hypersensitivity and TIA. The patients had had TIA's for many years. Unilateral internal carotid stenosis was detected in 15 cases, while 3 patients had bilateral carotid stenosis. On carotid sinus stimulation, syncope appeared and a TIA could be provoked. The mean duration of the syncopic attack was 5500 ms and was based on sinus arrest in 14 cases and on third degree AV block in 4 cases. In all patients carotid artery disobliteration was performed; in 14 patients pacemaker implantation was necessary, while 4 patients could be treated by atropine medication. The development of a TIA could be abolished in every patient and 14 patients remained totally symptom free. 
5	The role of sphincteroplasty for fecal incontinence reevaluated: a prospective physiologic and functional review. Sixteen female patients (mean age 54.1 years; range 34-74 years) with a 9.8-year (range 1-25 years) history of incontinence to solid stool underwent overlapping sphincteroplasty with internal sphincter imbrication without fecal diversion. All patients were prospectively evaluated with preoperative anorectal manometry, electromyography, and pudendal nerve motor latency assessment, postoperative anorectal manometry, and preoperative and postoperative functional evaluation. Mean and maximal resting pressures increased from 30 mm Hg and 49 mm Hg preoperatively to 40 mm Hg and 57 mm Hg, respectively, postoperatively. Likewise, mean and maximal squeeze pressures increased from 27 mm Hg and 48 mm Hg preoperatively to 39 mm Hg and 73 mm Hg, respectively, postoperatively (P less than 0.01). Furthermore, anal canal high pressure zone length was increased by sphincteroplasty from a mean of 0.9 cm (range 0-3 cm) to a mean of 2.1 cm (range 1-4 cm). These objective physiologic improvements correlated well with subjective functional improvement. Subjectively, functional outcome was rated by patients as excellent in 38 percent, good in 38 percent, fair in 19 percent, and poor in only 5 percent of cases. Overlapping sphincteroplasty with internal sphincter imbrication improves both the anal sphincter physiologic profile and fecal continence. 
5	False aneurysm of the internal mammary artery. Iatrogenic false aneurysm of a branch of the internal mammary artery after sternal wire closure is a very rare occurrence. We describe a case which appeared in a 62 year old woman operated upon for mitral valve replacement and diagnosed after Digital Subtraction Angiography. 
4	Intravascular ultrasound: a new potential modality for angioplasty guidance. Current angioplasty devices are limited by significant rates of arterial perforation and dissection, due to inadequate techniques of guidance, and by restenosis, which may be partly attributed to inadequate debulking of lesions. This paper describes the authors' initial experience in-vitro and in-vivo with intravascular ultrasound as a possible method of enhancing the three-dimensional guidance of devices through atherosclerotic obstructions. Using an in-vitro model they correlated the dimensions and histologic morphology of animal and human arteries with ultrasound images of the specimens. Additional in-vivo evaluations of this technology in canine arteriosclerotic and human atherosclerotic arteries preliminarily support the hypothesis that intravascular ultrasound defines the transmural arterial morphology and may enhance the accuracy of angioplasty procedures. Simultaneous imaging with angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound is demonstrated as a potential method of accurately defining both intraluminal and transmural arterial wall characteristics. 
4	Dietary salt and blood pressure. A perspective. Although dietary salt restriction is often valuable as sole or adjunctive therapy of hypertensive disorders, it is abundantly clear that hypertensive patients comprise a heterogeneous group with regard to salt sensitivity of blood pressure. This is apparent despite the many methodological obstacles to defining salt sensitivity in an individual patient. Currently, dietary trial is the only sure means of defining a given patient as responsive to salt restriction. Easily definable markers of salt sensitivity would allow appropriate targeting of this rather ponderous therapy. Promising leads include the assessment of membrane ion transporters such as sodium-lithium exchange and of the activity of the renin-angiotensin system, including the phenomenon of "non-modulating" hypertension and other volume regulatory hormones such as atrial natriuretic factor. Although less intensively studied than in hypertensive patients, the blood pressure response of normal subjects to salt restriction is also marked by great variability. Given the possibility of deleterious consequences of population-wide salt restriction for at least some people in a setting such as the United States, it seems imprudent to recommend such a policy before its proven worth has been demonstrated by clinical trial. Pending such evidence and the development of markers, salt restriction should be reserved for those in whom it is of demonstrated efficacy. 
5	Murine mast cells synthesize basement membrane components. A potential role in early fibrosis. Mast cells are resident in tissues, particularly in association with endothelial and epithelial cell basement membranes, and increase at sites of inflammation, injury, and fibrosis. Although mast cells are known to both release and generate proinflammatory molecules in response to inflammatory stimuli, little is known about their normal biologic function. Here we demonstrate that IL-3-dependent mouse PT18 mast cells, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells, and rat basophilic leukemia cells express large amounts of mRNA for collagen IV, laminin, and heparan sulfate proteoglycan. Western blot analysis confirmed that mast cells synthesize and secrete significant amounts collagen IV and laminin B1 and B2 chains. These data suggest that mast cells may contribute to normal tissue repair and/or the early overproduction of basement membrane components seen in a variety of fibrotic conditions. 
5	Functional upper airway obstruction in adolescents. Functional upper airway obstruction is an uncommon manifestation of a conversive reaction characterized by recurrent stridor attacks caused by adduction of the vocal cords during inspiration. The oxygen saturation never drops to pathologic levels. The stridor is not accompanied by an appropriate degree of anxiety and is not associated with other symptoms. Patients benefit from verbal reassurance and speech therapy, but stridor attacks tend to recur and psychiatric consultation seems necessary in most cases. We present the case histories of three adolescent patients with nonorganic upper airway obstruction and describe the features that may facilitate the diagnosis of this condition. Early diagnosis and intervention may prevent unnecessary and potentially harmful investigations and therapy. 
3	Relaxation training in school classes does not reduce headache complaints. The effect of teacher-presented Progressive Relaxation Training (PRT) on headaches, fear of failure and school problems was studied in school students. During ten physical education lessons, students received either PRT (n = 110) or placebo training (n = 92). The effect of the training was investigated in students who indicated the presence of headaches in a pre-training diary. No significant differences were found between both training groups regarding headache frequency, duration and intensity and the psychological variables. On the basis of these and previous findings, it is recommended to present PRT to fairly small groups of self-selected subjects instead of complete classes. 
5	Are measurements of height made by health visitors sufficiently accurate for routine screening of growth? To find out whether measurements of height made by health visitors are sufficiently accurate for use in routine screening of children we carried out an interobserver and intraobserver reliability study. Height measurements were made on a group of 10 children aged 3 years old and 10 aged 4.5 years old by two sets of four health visitors. They used a Microtoise or wall chart and the measurements were compared with those made by a trained auxologist with a Harpenden stadiometer. For a single assessment of height both pieces of equipment gave reasonably accurate results. In a child aged 3 years, with height measured on the Microtoise as 100 cm, the true height could be expected--with 95% probability--to lie between 99.2 cm-101.8 cm. At the age of 4.5 years, if the measurement was 110 cm, the child's true height could be expected to lie between 108.9 cm and 111.9 cm. The narrowest confidence interval for the growth rate from 3 to 4.5 years was achieved with the Microtoise, taking the mean of three measurements. We conclude that measurements made by health visitors are sufficiently accurate for routine screening of height, and the use of such measurements for the calculation of height velocity could be improved by more structured training. 
4	Diltiazem overdose: pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its metabolites and effect of multiple dose charcoal therapy. We describe a 38 year-old female who ingested 900 mg of diltiazem. She experienced hypotension, bradycardia and heart block but responded well to supportive care that included normal saline infusion and vasopressors. Calcium administration was not beneficial. Serial plasma concentrations of diltiazem, N-demethyldiltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem were quantified. By comparing the elimination half-life for diltiazem with historical controls, it is concluded that multiple dose charcoal therapy was not beneficial for our patient. 
1	Cervical rotation flaps for midface resurfacing. The midface has long served as a focus for creativity in surgical reconstruction. Full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness grafts, and distal flaps have long been used to attempt to reduplicate existing anatomy in this area. Recent reconstruction efforts have focused on the creative use of microvascular free flaps for this purpose. This article reports on the use of extensively developed regional rotation flaps as an excellent reconstructive modality for use in this area of the face. The details of surgical incisional planning are given. The nuances of surgical creation of these flaps and their rotation and suspension into place are given. The cases we have done using this technique for the past 3 years are reviewed. Our present indications for use of these flaps and their limitations are given. 
4	Evaluation of postprandial hyperemia in superior mesenteric artery and portal vein in healthy and cirrhotic humans: an operator-blind echo-Doppler study. In an operator-blind design, we used an echo-Doppler duplex system to examine superior mesenteric artery and portal vein hemodynamics on two consecutive mornings in 12 fasting cirrhotic patients and 12 matched controls, randomized to a standardized 355 kcal mixed-liquid meal vs. water. Cross-sectional area and mean velocity were recorded from the portal vein and superior mesenteric artery at 30 min intervals, from 0 min to 150 min after ingestion. Flows were calculated. Pulsatility index, an index related to vascular resistance, was obtained for the mesenteric artery. Baseline flows did not differ between cirrhotic patients and control patients, but pulsatility index was reduced in the cirrhotic subjects. Maximal postprandial hyperemia was attained at 30 min. Cirrhotic patients showed a blunted hyperemic response to food. In normal controls, portal vein area increased significantly after the meal from 30 min to 150 min, whereas in cirrhotic patients a significant difference occurred only at 30 min. Pulsatility index in both groups was significantly reduced after eating, and this reduction persisted up to 150 min. No changes after ingestion of water were observed. Echo-Doppler was very sensitive in detecting postprandial splanchnic hemodynamic changes and differences between cirrhotic patients and normal subjects. Mesenteric artery pulsatility index was more sensitive than flow in detecting baseline hemodynamic differences. In cirrhotic patients, portal postprandial hyperemia was mainly related to the increase in mean velocity. 
5	Total hip arthroplasty with cement. A long-term radiographic analysis in patients who are older than fifty and younger than fifty years. The long-term performance of a total of 712 Charnley and STH prostheses was evaluated as a function of the patient's age (older than fifty years or younger than fifty years) and of the underlying disease (osteoarthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or avascular necrosis). In patients who were older than fifty years, there were lower incidences of continuous cement-bone radiolucency about the acetabular component (p = 0.04), wear of the polyethylene acetabular cup (p = 0.03), and resorption of the calcar (p = 0.03). However, larger percentages of younger patients had rheumatoid arthritis or avascular necrosis. In the cohort of patients who had osteoarthrosis, the performance of the prosthesis did not differ significantly between older and younger patients; therefore we attributed the differences that were observed to the disease--that is, to rheumatoid arthritis or avascular necrosis. 
3	Atrial fibrillation after stroke in the elderly. To examine the relationship between atrial fibrillation and mortality after stroke, we studied 186 men and 167 women from the Waikato Stroke Registry whose mean age was 75.2 +/- 7.5 years. Twenty-three percent (82 of 353) had atrial fibrillation or flutter on their admission electrocardiogram. This group differed significantly from that with sinus rhythm in three respects: 1) They were older (p less than 0.01); 2) they had more severe current stroke deficit as evidenced by lower limb power (p less than 0.05) and Mini-Mental State Score (p less than 0.001), higher incidence of homonomous hemianopia (p less than 0.05), and lower incidence of lacunar syndrome stroke (p less than 0.001); and 3) they had a significantly higher incidence of cardiomegaly and congestive heart failure (p less than 0.01). Functional outcome was insignificantly better in the group with sinus rhythm. During a mean follow-up period of 18 months, mortality was significantly higher in the group with atrial fibrillation (p = 0.001). Proportional hazards modeling, however, showed that the apparently poorer survival in those patients with atrial fibrillation could be explained by factors other than cardiac rhythm, such as age, Mini-Mental State Score, level of consciousness, and interstitial edema on admission chest radiograph. Thus, atrial fibrillation was not an independent predictor of survival after stroke. 
3	Sudden blindness after thermocoagulation of the trigeminal ganglion. Sudden blindness during percutaneous thermocoagulation of the gasserian ganglion occurred in a 72-year-old woman with trigeminal neuralgia. Considered a safe procedure, we highlight the possibility of this serious complication which was probably due to direct damage of the optic nerve. 
4	Clinical significance of simple heart rate-adjusted ST segment depression in supine leg exercise in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. To evaluate the clinical significance of simple heart rate-adjusted ST segment depression (delta ST/delta HR) in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, 42 patients with stable exertional angina underwent supine leg exercise testing and cardiac catheterization. During exercise, heart rate, a multilead electrocardiogram, and pulmonary artery wedge pressure were recorded. The sensitivity and accuracy of the delta ST/delta HR criteria (greater than or equal to 3.0 microV/beat/min) were significantly greater than the conventional analysis of ST segment depression criteria (greater than or equal to 0.2 mV) for detecting three-vessel coronary artery disease at a matched specificity of 72% (100% versus 46%, 81% versus 64%, p less than 0.01). A significant linear correlation was found between maximum pulmonary artery wedge pressure increments during exercise (delta PAWP) or Gensini score and the delta ST/delta HR (delta PAWP: r = 0.51, p less than 0.001; Gensini score: r = 0.47, p less than 0.001). There were no statistically significant differences in the delta PAWP or Gensini score between patients with three-vessel disease who had delta ST/delta HR greater than or equal to 3.0 microV/beat/min and those with one- or two-vessel disease who had delta ST/delta HR greater than or equal to 3.0 microV/beat/min (delta PAWP: 18.1 +/- 2.0 versus 21.9 +/- 3.3, p = NS; Gensini score: 68.5 +/- 6.6 versus 66.3 +/- 11.3, p = NS). These findings demonstrate that delta ST/delta HR is more useful than a conventional analysis of ST segment depression for identifying not only anatomically severe coronary artery disease but also functionally severe coronary artery disease. 
1	Elderly men with histories of heavy drinking: correlates and consequences. Recognition that the physical, psychological and social consequences of substance abuse may persist throughout the life span has led to increased study of the impact of lifetime drinking habits on the elderly. We examined the characteristics of elderly men with self-reported histories of having ever been heavy drinker (H+) in a population-based (N = 1,155, mean age = 73.7 years) longitudinal survey of community-dwelling elders; 10.4% of the men reported that they had been heavy drinkers at some time during their lives. H+ men were younger and less educated than non-heavy drinkers (H-) or never drinkers (N). Mortality was higher among H+ men who were current drinkers than among H- or N men. H+ men reported more major illnesses, poorer self-perceived health status, more physician visits, more depressive symptoms, lower levels of life satisfaction and smaller social networks than did H- or N men. Self-reported ability to perform activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living was poorest among H+ men, who also scored the lowest on a mental status examination. Thus, a history of having ever been a heavy drinker is predictive of widespread impairments in physical, psychological and social health and functioning among elderly men. 
4	Plasma homocyst(e)ine levels in men with premature coronary artery disease. Plasma homocyst(e)ine (that is, the sum of free and bound homocysteine and its oxidized forms, homocystine and homocysteine-cysteine mixed disulfide) levels were determined in 170 men (mean age +/- SD 50 +/- 7 years) with premature coronary artery disease diagnosed at coronary angiography and in 255 control subjects clinically free of coronary artery disease (mean age 49 +/- 6 years). Patients with coronary artery disease had a higher homocyst(e)ine level than control subjects (13.66 +/- 6.44 versus 10.93 +/- 4.92 nmol/ml, p less than 0.001). High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels were lower (32 +/- 10 versus 46 +/- 13 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) and triglycerides levels were higher (193 +/- 103 versus 136 +/- 106 mg/dl, p less than 0.001) in the coronary disease group. Plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were not significantly different between patients with coronary disease and control subjects. The presence of hypertension, smoking or diabetes mellitus did not significantly alter homocyst(e)ine levels in the patient or the control group. Patients who were not taking a beta-adrenergic blocking drug (n = 70) had a nonsignificantly higher homocyst(e)ine level than did patients taking this class of drugs (n = 100) (14.67 +/- 8.92 versus 12.95 +/- 3.77 nmol/ml, p = 0.087). By design, none of the control subjects were taking a beta-blocker. No significant correlations were observed between homocyst(e)ine and age, serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol or triglyceride levels. It is concluded that an elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine level is an independent risk factor for the development of premature coronary atherosclerosis in men. 
5	Musculoskeletal abnormalities in a patient with juvenile hypothyroidism. Abnormalities in growth and development are the most striking clinical features of juvenile acquired hypothyroidism. Therefore, physicians should consider the diagnosis of hypothyroidism in any child with musculoskeletal growth dysfunction. Drs Kilpatrick and Fincher describe a case demonstrating the severe and potentially irreversible effects of prolonged, untreated hypothyroidism. 
4	Blood pressure response to dietary calcium intervention in humans. Epidemiological and experimental studies have suggested that dietary calcium deficiency may lead to the development of hypertension. This article reviews findings in human trials on calcium intervention with special reference to the responses of blood pressure and biochemical variables. Calcium supplementation consistently resulted in decreased blood pressure in a subset of hypertensive and normotensive subjects, but led to increased blood pressure in some hypertensive patients. The variable blood pressure responses to calcium supplementation could not be predicted on the basis of routine biochemical parameters and appeared to be due to differences in the backgrounds of the subjects and/or the design and size of the trials. It is concluded that further studies are required on the hypotensive effect of calcium supplementation. 
3	Articulatory impairment associated with tardive dyskinesia. The speech of two patients with tardive dyskinesia was studied, and one neuroleptic-treated patient having no signs of overt tardive dyskinesia served as control. A structured interview, including reading, repetition of sentences, and spontaneous conversation, was performed. A phonetic transcription and analysis of abnormal phonemes was done by a linguist under blind conditions. Both patients with tardive dyskinesia had abnormal phonemes whereas the control patient had none. These differences could not be explained by age, direct neuroleptic effect, or neuroleptic exposure time. The abnormal phonemes were all consonants. The authors conclude that tardive dyskinesia may cause articulatory communication problems. 
5	Body position changes redistribute lung computed-tomographic density in patients with acute respiratory failure. Ten patients with parenchymal acute respiratory failure (ARF) underwent computed tomography (CT) scans while in the supine and prone positions. At equal levels of positive end-expiratory pressure, the authors measured the changes of CT density in dorsal and ventral basilar lung regions induced by the change of position as well as alterations of gas exchange. The level of venous admixture did not change with body position. The CT scan image of each lung was fractionated into ten levels from dorsal to ventral, each constituting 10% of the lung height. After measuring each lung fraction, the volume, the average CT number, its frequency distribution, and the expected normal value, we computed the lung tissue mass, the excess tissue mass, and the fraction of normally inflated tissue (excess tissue mass = amount of "tissue," which includes edema, cells, and blood in excess of the expected normal value). We also estimated the superimposed hydrostatic pressure on each lung region. We found that the excess lung tissue mass is independent of position. However, in patients in the supine position, lung CT density increased and regional inflation decreased from ventral to dorsal, suggesting progressive deflation of gas-containing alveoli along the gravity gradient. A similar ventral-dorsal deflation pattern occurred within 10 min in patients in the prone position. We conclude that the lung in patients with ARF behaves like an elastic body with a diffusely increased mass; dependent lung regions are compressed by the pressure of overlying structures. 
5	Role of cell-mediated immunity to staphylococci in blepharitis. We studied cell-mediated immunity to staphylococcal antigens in 116 patients with chronic blepharitis and eight normal subjects. Antibodies in tears and blood were measured. Enhanced cell-mediated immunity to Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated in 46 of 116 patients (40%) in the absence of antibodies to teichoic acid but not among normal subjects. Symptoms of grittiness and morning stickiness were more frequent among patients without enhanced responses. Folliculitis occurred more commonly among patients with enhanced immunity. Marginal keratitis occurred equally among patients with and without enhanced systemic immunity, but patients with enhanced response more commonly required topical corticosteroid therapy. Desensitization to staphylococcal antigens could be investigated as a potential therapeutic approach in selected patients. 
5	Afferent nipple valve malfunction caused by anchoring collar: an unexpected late complication of the Kock continent ileal reservoir. In the construction of a Kock continent ileal reservoir for urinary diversion, significantly high rates of late postoperative complications regarding nipple valves, the efferent limb in particular, have been reported. There are only a few reports on afferent nipple valve malfunction. A total of 42 patients who underwent a Kock pouch operation and were observed for more than 12 months (mean 38 months) was evaluated in terms of afferent nipple valve malfunction. Late afferent nipple valve complications were observed in 10 of the 42 patients (24%). These complications included erosion of the polyester fiber fabric used as a collar (5 patients), stenosis of the afferent limb (2) and obstruction of the afferent nipple by a mucous plug or fungus ball (3). The latter 2 complications were due to mechanical or dynamic obstruction of urine flow caused by a nonabsorbable collar. None of the 10 patients had problems with efferent nipple valve function. Our results suggest that the peristaltic direction of the intestine and the use of nonabsorbable material as a collar are primarily responsible for the late afferent nipple valve complications. Further modifications are needed to produce a stable nipple valve. Otherwise, simpler and more reliable alternative techniques of antireflux anastomosis should be considered. 
1	Decalcification of a choroidal osteoma. A 56-year-old man presented with a clearly defined orange tumour in the posterior pole of his left eye. A choroidal osteoma was suspected, and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated subretinal neovascularisation on the nasal edge of the tumour, which was treated with krypton laser photocoagulation twice. Recurrent subretinal neovascularisation occurred one year later and was not amenable to treatment. Three years after the patient first presented, thinning of the tumour was noted on follow-up examination. During the next 15 months the tumour completely disappeared, leaving an area of retinal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy. Total decalcification of the choroidal osteoma was demonstrated by ultrasonography. 
5	Ultrastructural evidence of the effects of shear stress variation on intimal thickening in dogs with arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts. Based on our findings that changes in wall shear stress, not the rate of blood flow, were the main hemodynamic factor related to intimal hyperplasia of autologous vein grafts, we further investigated the effect of wall shear stress variation on sequential ultrastructural changes in the intimal hyperplasia of arterially transplanted autovein grafts, using canine models. As noted, wall shear stress variation (tau-variation) could be defined by the variation in wall shear stress within a cardiac cycle, using a desktop flow waveform analyzer. In Group I, which had a high flow rate of 78.4 +/- 4.6 ml/min and low tau-variation of 36.1 +/- 2.2 dynes/cm2, intimal hyperplasia was significant. Ultrastructurally, there was a marked transformation of intimal smooth muscle cells to secretory cells 2 to 4 weeks after implantation. The surface of the intima was lined with modified smooth muscle cells at 2 weeks after implantation. In Group II, which had a low flow rate of 5.6 +/- 2.2 ml/min and normal tau-variation value (174.6 +/- 13.0 dynes/cm2), intimal hyperplasia was minimal, and there were several layers of contractile type smooth muscle cells, with characteristic myofibrillae. The surface of the intima was lined with endothelial cells at 2 weeks after implantation. These findings suggest that, in regions of low wall shear stress variation, intimal smooth muscle cells of autovein grafts may well become secretory cells, and enhanced platelet adherence could occur during early intimal repair, causing intimal hyperplasia to develop. 
4	Cardiac tamponade and contralateral hemothorax after subclavian vein catheterization. A patient developed life-threatening cardiac tamponade and contralateral hemothorax after insertion of a subclavian catheter in the operating room. Contrast was infused through the catheter, demonstrating its malposition in the pericardial space. Contrast infusion was valuable in evaluating this complication of central line placement. 
4	Effect of naproxen and sulindac on blood pressure response to atenolol. Twenty-eight patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension well controlled by atenolol entered a five-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of sulindac and naproxen on blood pressure (BP) control. Atenolol alone was administered during weeks 1, 3, and 5. Naproxen or sulindac was administered with atenolol during week 2, with crossover during week 4. Data were analyzed for 27 of the patients (one dropped out after developing a skin rash). Naproxen significantly increased the systolic BP compared with placebo (mean 4.0 mm Hg; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.1-7.0; p less than 0.05). There were no significant differences in systolic BP during sulindac administration compared with placebo or naproxen. No significant effects on diastolic BP were observed. Weight was increased by naproxen and sulindac compared with placebo (mean 0.6-0.8 kg, p less than 0.05), although not to a clinically significant extent. One-week therapy with naproxen has a greater potential than sulindac to increase systolic BP in well-controlled hypertensive patients receiving atenolol; however, the increase is minor and unlikely to be of clinical significance. 
4	Inhibitory role of the coronary arterial endothelium to alpha-adrenergic stimulation in experimental heart failure. The role of the endothelium in regulating coronary alpha-adrenergic tone was evaluated in isolated coronary arterial rings from dogs with and without pacing-induced congestive heart failure (CHF). The maximal contractile response to methoxamine was attenuated approximately 43% (p less than 0.05) in both intact and denuded CHF rings compared with control. Conversely, norepinephrine-induced contractions were diminished 58% in intact CHF vessels and 39% in denuded CHF vessels (p less than 0.05). Denudation did not alter responses to methoxamine but significantly (p less than 0.05) augmented the tension generated by norepinephrine in both control (1.7-fold) and CHF (2.4-fold) arteries. In both intact control and CHF coronary arteries, norepinephrine elicited rapid, transient relaxations that preceded slow, sustained contractions; the initial relaxation phase was endothelium dependent, because denudation eliminated the response. Relaxations to the selective alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist BHT 920 were also dependent on the presence of an endothelium. At peak CHF, endothelium-dependent relaxations to norepinephrine and BHT 920 were enhanced, whereas relaxations to nitroglycerin and acetylcholine were unaltered. The data suggest that alpha-adrenergic tone in canine coronary arteries is diminished by pacing-induced CHF because of a decrease in alpha 1-adrenoceptor-mediated constriction and an enhanced capacity of the endothelium to antagonize the direct vascular smooth muscle response of norepinephrine through endothelium-dependent, alpha 2-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxations. 
5	Ultrastructural demonstration of peroxidase expression in acute unclassified leukemias: correlation to immunophenotype and treatment outcome. The lineage affinity of 57 cases of acute unclassified leukemias (AUL) was reevaluated by ultrastructural analysis of peroxidase expression (POEM) in combination with immunophenotyping and analysis of immunoglobulin gene configuration. Twenty-three cases of myeloid and three cases of megakaryocytic differentiation were identified by detection of ultrastructural myeloperoxidase (UMPO) and platelet peroxidase (UPPO). No significant correlation was noted between myeloid marker expression and POEM positivity, whereas presence of CD 19 or CD 24 antigen significantly correlated with POEM negativity (P = .001 and .023, respectively). Ig gene rearrangements including oligoclonal patterns were also recorded in 8 of 14 UMPO+ patients tested. Fourteen UMPO+ patients responded poorly to an ALL/AUL chemotherapy regimen with a low complete remission (CR) rate of 29% and a short median remission duration (MRD) of 5 months. The POEM- patients proved very heterogenous with respect to immunophenotype and Ig gene rearrangement. Seventeen of 21 patients tested had Ig gene rearrangements, including oligoclonal patterns. Combined data suggest that a proportion of these cases probably derive from a very immature lymphoid progenitor cell, particularly because 15 POEM- AUL patients showed a response to ALL/AUL chemotherapy comparable to that observed in patients with definitive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (CR rate 80%, MRD 20 months). Thus, ultrastructural analysis of peroxidase expression can provide decisive prognostic information in AUL patients. 
5	Fluorosilicone oil in the treatment of retinal detachment. We evaluated the use of a heavier-than-water fluorinated silicone oil in the treatment of 30 selected cases of complicated retinal detachment from January 1988 to July 1989. Proliferative vitreoretinopathy grade C-2 or greater accounted for 19 cases, proliferative diabetic retinopathy with traction detachment for two cases, giant retinal tears five, ruptured globe with retinal detachment two, massive choroidal effusion with retinal detachment one, and acute retinal necrosis with retinal detachment one. Initial retinal reattachment was achieved in all cases. Complications included redetachment seven (23%), cataract six (75% of phakic patients), raised intraocular pressure four (13%), hypotony four (13%), keratopathy three (10%), uveitis-synechia formation three (10%), phthisis two (3%), choroidal haemorrhage one (3%), and vitreous haemorrhage one (3%). Postoperative visual acuities with at least six months' follow-up range from no light perception to 20/50, with seven patients (23%) 20/400 or better. 
1	Oral manifestations of HIV infection and their management. II. Less common lesions. This second of two articles reviews the many uncommon and rare oral lesions that have arisen in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The various drug-related oral disorders of HIV disease are also considered. 
4	Incidence of myocarditis. A 10-year autopsy study from Malmo, Sweden. Although myocarditis has been known for almost two centuries, data in regard to its incidence have varied widely. Autopsy studies have reported an incidence of 3.5% to as high as 10%. The main reason for such diversity of data appears to be the lack of unanimity as to what constitutes myocarditis. Recently, definitions of myocarditis have been proposed and precise criteria for the morphologic recognition of myocarditis have been published. In this study an analysis of 12,747 consecutive autopsies performed from 1975 to 1984 at Malmo (Sweden) General Hospital was carried out. Applying the newly proposed histologic criteria, the diagnosis of myocarditis was made in 136 cases, which constitute 1.06% of the autopsy population studied. This rate of myocarditis incidence at postmortem is lower by far than rates previously published. 
5	Multivessel coronary angioplasty from 1980 to 1989: procedural results and long-term outcome From June 1980 to January 1989, 3,186 patients had coronary angioplasty of two (2,399 patients) or three (787 patients) of the three major epicardial coronary systems. A mean of 3.6 lesions (range 2 to 14) were dilated per patient, with a 96% success rate. Acute complications were seen in 94 patients (2.9%) and included Q wave infarction in 47 (1.4%), urgent coronary artery bypass surgery in 33 (1%) and death in 31 (1%). Multivariate correlates of in-hospital death included impaired left ventricular function, age greater than or equal to 70 years and female gender. Complete long-term follow-up data were available for the first 700 patients and the follow-up period averaged 54 +/- 15 months in duration. Actuarial 1 and 5 year survival rates were 97% and 88%, respectively, and were not different in patients with two or three vessel disease. By Cox regression analysis, age greater than or equal to 70 years, left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% and prior coronary artery bypass surgery were associated with an increased mortality rate during the follow-up period. Repeat revascularization procedures were required in 322 patients (46%). Restenosis resulted in either repeat angioplasty or bypass surgery in 227 patients (32%). Repeat coronary angioplasty was performed for isolated restenosis in 126 patients (18%), for restenosis and disease progression at new sites in 85 patients (12%) and for new disease progression alone in 54 patients (8%). Coronary bypass surgery was required in 110 patients (16%) during the follow-up period. 
5	Pulmonary tolerance of prophylactic aerosolized pentamidine in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. The effects of primary and secondary long-term prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with aerosolized pentamidine on pulmonary function in HIV+ patients were evaluated. Eighty-one patients, none of whom were drug addicts or had pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, were studied. Fifty patients were receiving AP as secondary prophylaxis, 36 monthly and 14 twice-monthly; eight patients with a history of PCP served as control subjects. Twenty-three patients were receiving AP as primary prophylaxis, 12 monthly and 11 twice-monthly. Pulmonary function tests, including spirometry, lung transfer capacity for carbon monoxide (Tlco) and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (P[A-a]O2) were evaluated at M1, ie, one month after the diagnosis of PCP, or at the beginning of the AP prophylaxis, and then at three-month intervals (M4 to M13). No differences were observed in the results of spirometry or P(A-a)O2. Among the patients receiving secondary prophylaxis, a significant increase (paired Student's t-test) in Tlco occurred at M7 compared to M1 in the group receiving monthly administrations (p less than 0.01) and in the untreated control group (p less than 0.05); there was no significant difference in Tlco at M13 compared to M1 in the 12 patients who received monthly administrations for this period or at M7 in the 14 patients receiving AP twice-monthly. No significant difference in Tlco was observed at M7 in the primary prophylaxis groups. These results indicate that pulmonary tolerance of AP, as reflected by pulmonary function tests, is good. 
2	Modified Kraske approach for disease of the mid-rectum. A modification of Dr. Paul Kraske's approach for removal of mid-rectal lesions has been used in 11 patients from 1977 to 1988 by the senior authors. Patients ranged in age from 56 to 89 yr, with an average of 67 yr. There were seven male and four female patients. Indications for surgery were as follows: villous adenoma (seven), carcinoid (one), recurrent dysplasia in a previous endoscopic polypectomy site (one), positive distal margin for neoplasm following low anterior sigmoid resection (one), and adenocarcinoma in one elderly poor-risk patient. All lesions were in the middle rectum (7-11 cm from the anal verge, average 9 cm). The postoperative stay ranged from 6 to 12 days with a mean of 8 days. The average follow-up for the 11 patients is 3 1/2 yr (1 month to 7 yr), with only one patient having a local recurrent lesion. There was no morbidity or mortality. We conclude that this modification of the Kraske approach offers a good alternative for excision of mid-rectal lesions in terms of technical ease, efficacy, safety, and patient tolerance. The modified Kraske approach is indicated in certain situations and should be a part of the surgeon's armamentarium. 
3	Striatonigral degeneration. A clinicopathological study. The clinical and pathological features of 10 cases of striatonigral degeneration are described: 5 were misdiagnosed in life as Parkinson's disease. Retrospectively, helpful early pointers to the diagnosis in these cases included unexplained falls, autonomic dysfunction, absence of rest tremor and failure to respond to L-dopa, but these were not always present. The pathological diagnosis could not be excluded on macroscopic examination of the striatum. Relative preservation of the putamen occurred in the 4 patients who benefited from L-dopa. The caudate nucleus was involved in all cases and there was no sparing of the large striatal neurons. In mild cases, involvement of the putamen was confined to its posterior two-thirds, dorsolaterally. With increasing severity this extended in a dorsal to ventral and posterior to anterior direction. Seven of the cases had evidence of olivopontocerebellar damage, but only 2 of these had clinical evidence of cerebellar disease. Correlation was found between the neuronal counts in caudate:putamen, striatum:nigra compacta, globus pallidus:nigra compacta, nigra compacta:locus coeruleus. The most severely involved part of the substantia nigra pars compacta was the ventrolateral zone, which projects to the dorsal putamen, the earliest site of striatal disease. 
4	Arterial blood pressure. Correlation with erythrocyte count, hematocrit, and hemoglobin concentration. The relationship between arterial blood pressure and red blood cell variables was investigated in 1013 unselected persons with a blood pressure range of 90 to 225 mm Hg systolic and 50 to 145 mm Hg diastolic. Statistically significant correlations were demonstrated between mean (as well as systolic and diastolic) arterial blood pressure and red blood cell count (r = 0.27; P less than .0001), hematocrit (r = 0.28; P less than .0001), and hemoglobin concentration (r = 0.29; P less than .0001). Average arterial blood pressure was higher in men than in women (133 +/- 16/83 +/- 10 v 124 +/- 16/79 +/- 9 mm Hg, P less than .0001) and this was associated with higher values for erythrocyte count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit in men as compared to women. The significant correlation of blood pressure and hematocrit, which represents one important determinant of blood viscosity, points to a role for rheological factors in the long-term control of blood pressure. Moreover, it might be speculated that the sex difference in blood pressure as observed in the present study may be due, at least in part, to stimulated erythropoiesis in men as compared to women. 
1	Direct interaction of a ligand for the erbB2 oncogene product with the EGF receptor and p185erbB2. The erbB2 oncogene encodes a 185-kilodalton transmembrane protein whose sequence is similar to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A 30-kilodalton factor (gp30) secreted from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells was shown to be a ligand for p185erbB2. An antibody to EGFR abolished the tyrosine phosphorylation induced by EGF and transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) but only partially blocked that produced by gp30 in SK-BR-3 breast cancer cells. In two cell lines that overexpress erbB2 but do not expresss EGFR (MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells and a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that had been transfected with erbB2), phosphorylation of p185erbB2 was induced only by gp30. The gp30 specifically inhibited the growth of cells that overexpressed p185erbB2. An antibody to EGFR had no effect on the inhibition of SK-BR-3 cell colony formation obtained with gp30. Thus, it appeared that gp30 interacted directly with the EGFR and erbB2. Direct binding of gp30 to p185erbB2 was confirmed by binding competition experiments, where gp30 was found to displace the p185erbB2 binding of a specific antibody to p185erbB2. The evidence described here suggests that gp30 is a ligand for p185erbB2. 
4	Morphologic comparison of patients with mitral valve prolapse who died suddenly with patients who died from severe valvular dysfunction or other conditions. Clinical and necropsy findings are described in 56 patients with mitral valve prolapse: 15 patients, aged 16 to 69 years (mean 39), died suddenly and mitral valve prolapse was the only cardiac condition found at necropsy (hereafter called isolated mitral valve prolapse); the remaining 41 patients had other conditions that were capable of being fatal. Of the latter 41 patients, 7, aged 17 to 59 years (mean 45), had associated congenital heart disease, and 34 patients, aged 17 to 70 years (mean 52), had no associated congenital cardiac abnormalities. Compared with the 34 patients without associated congenital heart disease and with nonmitral valve prolapse conditions capable in themselves of being fatal, the 15 patients who died suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse were younger (mean age 39 +/- 17 versus 52 +/- 15 years; p = 0.01), more often women (67% versus 26%; p = 0.008) and had a lower frequency of mitral regurgitation (7% versus 38%; p = 0.02). The 15 patients dying suddenly with isolated mitral valve prolapse also were less likely to have evidence of ruptured chordae tendineae (29% versus 67%; p = 0.04). The frequency of increased heart weight (67% versus 59%), a dilated mitral valve anulus (80% versus 81%), a dilated tricuspid valve anulus (17% versus 17%), an elongated anterior mitral leaflet (86% versus 54%), an elongated posterior mitral leaflet (79% versus 77%) and fibrous endocardial plaque under the posterior mitral leaflet (73% versus 63%) was similar between the two groups. The severity of the prolapse (mild 20% versus 11%; moderate 27% versus 58%; severe 53% versus 32%) also was similar between the two groups. Thus, persons with mitral valve prolapse dying suddenly without another recognized condition tend to be relatively young women without mitral regurgitation. 
1	Prospective study of estrogen replacement therapy and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women [published erratum appears in JAMA 1991 Apr 10;265(14):1828] We prospectively examined the use of estrogen replacement therapy in relation to breast cancer incidence in a cohort of women 30 to 55 years of age in 1976. During 367 187 person-years of follow-up among postmenopausal women, 722 incident cases of breast cancer were documented. Overall, past users of replacement estrogen were not at increased risk (relative risk, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.81 to 1.18), including even those with more than 10 years since last [corrected] use (relative risk after adjustment for established risk factors, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.45 to 1.10). However, the risk of breast cancer was significantly elevated among current users (relative risk, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.67). Among current users, a stronger relationship was observed with increasing age but not with increasing duration of use. These data suggest that long-term past use of estrogen replacement therapy is not related to risk of breast cancer but that current use may modestly increase risk. 
5	The efficacy of central venous and pulmonary artery catheters and therapy based upon them in reducing mortality and morbidity. The purpose of this study was to (1) evaluate the relative cost effectiveness of the central venous pressure and flow-directed pulmonary artery catheters used to maintain normal hemodynamic values as therapeutic goals in the control groups vs supranormal values empirically observed in critically ill postoperative survivors in the protocol groups, and (2) to evaluate tissue perfusion and oxygenation in relationship to organ failure and mortality. In two prospective clinical trials there were no significant differences in outcome between the central venous pressure and pulmonary artery control groups that used normal values as therapeutic goals. However, there were marked and significant reductions in morbidity and mortality of the protocol groups using the supranormal cardiac index, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption values as goals. The cumulative oxygen debt was less and organ failures were fewer and less severe in the protocol groups than in the control groups. 
4	Hypertension during pregnancy in insulin-dependent diabetic women. Insulin-dependent diabetic patients are at increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. This study was designed to study prospectively the rate of pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) in 175 insulin-dependent diabetic pregnancies (88 White classes B-C, 87 classes D-RT). Pregnancy-induced hypertension was defined as two or more occurrences after 20 weeks' gestation of a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 105 mmHg or greater or an increase of 20 mmHg or greater from the baseline MAP. The rate of PIH in the diabetic population was 15.4% and was significantly associated with nulliparity, poor glycemic control in the first and second trimesters, and advanced White class. Neonatal outcome was not significantly altered in the presence of PIH. We speculate that improved glycemic control throughout pregnancy might reduce the rate of this complication in diabetic patients. 
5	Ileal duplication cyst causing massive bleeding in a child. Intestinal duplication is a rare congenital anomaly; nonetheless, it comprises more than half of all alimentary duplication disorders. Our case report describes the hemorrhagic sequelae of this entity with surgical and pathologic findings. A review of anatomical classification, embryology, and natural history of duplication cyst follows; differentiating characteristics of duplication cyst versus Meckel's diverticulum are outlined. Intestinal duplication cyst should be considered in the differential diagnosis of GI bleeding, especially in children. 
3	Disturbances in the cerebral perfusion of human immune deficiency virus-1 seropositive asymptomatic subjects: a quantitative tomography study of 18 cases. Quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by xenon-133 (133Xe) tomography, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), psychometric tests, and laboratory analyses were performed on 18 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) seropositive asymptomatic subjects. Abnormalities of cerebral perfusion were observed in 16 cases (88%). These abnormalities were particularly frequent in the frontal regions (77% of cases). MRI demonstrated leucoencephalopathy in only two cases. EEG showed only induced diffuse abnormalities in two cases. Psychometric tests showed restricted moderate disturbances in 55% of patients. These disturbances mostly concerned those sectors involved in cognitive functions and memorization. These results indicate that quantitative measurements of CBF by 133Xe-SPECT is capable of detecting abnormalities of cerebral perfusion at a very early stage (Phase II) of HIV-1 infection. These abnormalities are indications of disturbances resulting from unidentified metabolic or vascular lesions. This technique appears to be superior to MRI at this stage of the disease's development. It could provide objective information leading to earlier treatment, and prove useful in evaluating potential antiviral chemotherapy. 
5	Local failure and related complications after definitive treatment of carcinoma of the prostate by irradiation or surgery. The authors review their institution's experience with the failure of definitive treatment to achieve local tumor control and with the distant dissemination and local morbidity associated with such failure. The causes of local failure are various: incomplete resection, implantation of spilled cells, and, possibly, selective implantation of circulating tumor cells in traumatized tissues after surgery and totally or partially resistant cells, new tumors, or radiologic misses after radiation. Treatment of local failure may be prophylactic or therapeutic and differs depending on the stage of the disease. Failure to control the tumor locally in the presence of distant metastases does not alter the length of survival, but it can profoundly affect the quality of survival. 
5	Recurrent wheezy bronchitis and viral respiratory infections Fifty four patients aged from 1 to 6 years who had had recurrent attacks of wheezy bronchitis were prospectively followed up for three months to find out if there was an association between different viral respiratory infections and episodes of wheezing. Of the 115 episodes of upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms, virus or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection were diagnosed in 52 (45%). Thirty four of rhinoviruses. The patients had an average of 2.1 episodes of respiratory tract symptoms the total mean (SD) duration of which was 30 (2) days of the 92 days that followed. Wheezing occurred during 76 (66%) of the 115 episodes and during a third of these the patient was admitted to hospital because of severe dyspnoea. Wheezing started a mean (SD) of 43 (7) hours after the first symptoms of respiratory infection and persisted for 3.8 (4.2) days in patients in whom virus infection was diagnosed. The incidence of wheezing was not associated with IgE mediated atopy, with positive virological tests, or with fever during virus infection, but was associated with parental smoking and more than one sibling. 
5	A community-based study of acute respiratory tract infections in children in Uruguay. Acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) was investigated in children less than 5 years old in a longitudinal community-based study of 166 families living in a socioeconomically depressed area in Montevideo, Uruguay. Pediatricians made home visits every 10 days from May 1985 to December 1987, and symptoms and signs of ARI were recorded. The incidence of ARI was 5.8 episodes per child-year during the first 12 months of life and decreased with increasing age of the index children; the rate was highest in children 1-5 months old. Children observed from birth were ill during 21% of the visits. According to the definitions of the study, the incidence of lower respiratory tract infection was 11.6% higher than the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections. The rates of ARI were higher during the colder months. Most risk factors for ARI were only marginally statistically significant. 
1	Distinct characteristics of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells derived from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). A factor in B-CLL serum promotes natural killer cell-like LAK cell growth. We show that lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell precursors derived from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and cultured in the presence of recombinant interleukin-2 and normal human serum (NHS), develop into primarily NK cell-like (CD 57+) LAK cells, whereas identically prepared LAK cell precursors from normal subjects develop into mainly T cell-like (CD 3+, CD 8+) LAK cells. B-CLL LAK cells exhibited greater proliferative capacity than did normal LAK cells. When normal LAK cells were grown in B-CLL serum instead of NHS, their proliferation increased; NK cell levels also increased to those found in B-CLL LAK cells, suggesting that B-CLL serum contains a factor that promotes NK cell-like growth, LAK cells derived from normal or B-CLL patients demonstrated similar lytic activity toward K562 and Raji cells. Growth in B-CLL serum did not reduce their lytic potential. Thus, the altered phenotype and growth exhibited by B-CLL LAK cells and normal LAK cells grown in B-CLL serum does not lead to abnormalities in their cytolytic functions. We propose instead that the predominance of NK-like cells in B-CLL LAK cell populations and the presence of an NK cell-like growth factor in B-CLL serum reflect abnormalities related to NK cell-mediated B-cell regulation; ie, either inhibition of normal B-cell growth and/or growth stimulation of the leukemic clone in B-CLL. 
4	Case-control study of coronary heart disease risk factors in the elderly. We undertook a case-control study utilizing a large coronary arteriography database to determine if traditional cardiovascular risk factors are as predictive of the presence of angiographically-proven coronary artery disease (CAD) in elderly patients as in younger patients. Among the patients aged 65 years or more, there were 2120 cases and 193 controls, while for the patients aged 35-49 years there were 1493 cases and 707 controls. Odds ratios obtained from logistic regression indicated that age, male sex, diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension, total cholesterol and left ventricular hypertrophy were all significant risk factors for CAD in both age groups, although the odds ratios tended to be somewhat lower in the elderly. Logistic regression analysis for gender subgroups generally revealed similar findings when compared with the combined (males + females) age groups, although power was limited for the subgroup of elderly males which had few controls. We conclude that most of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors which have been described as correlated with the presence of CAD in younger populations are also correlated with angiographically-proven CAD in older patients. 
1	Effect of morphine on growth of metastatic colon cancer in vivo. Control of colon cancer depends, in part, on intact immune defense mechanisms. Since opiates are known to affect some components of immune function, this study was conducted to determine the effect of high-dose subcutaneous morphine sulfate and of low-dose intrathecal morphine on the postoperative growth of metastatic colon cancer. Five groups of 15 Fischer 344 rats were given intraportal injections of colon cancer cells as follows: group 1, control; group 2, daily subcutaneous injections of 20-mg/kg morphine the day before and for 2 days after colon cancer cell inoculation; group 3, daily subcutaneous injections of saline; group 4, daily intrathecal injections of 20 micrograms of morphine; and group 5, daily intrathecal injections of saline. There was a significant decrease in the hepatic tumor burden in group 2 compared with groups 1 and 3 and a significant increase in the hepatic tumor burden in groups 4 and 5 compared with group 1. This study demonstrates that intermittent injections of a narcotic may decrease the growth of tumor cells that gain access to the circulation during a surgical procedure. In addition, the results support the concept that tumor cells entering the circulation during a vulnerable period of postoperative immunosuppression are more likely to survive as metastatic tumor. 
2	Elevated plasma aluminum levels in normal infants receiving antacids containing aluminum. Aluminum toxicity is a documented cause of encephalopathy, anemia, and osteomalacia. Excretion is primarily renal; therefore, patients with renal insufficiency are at risk for aluminum accumulation and toxicity. This has been demonstrated in uremic children treated with aluminum-containing antacids. The purpose of this study was to determine whether plasma aluminum levels were elevated in infants with normal renal function during prolonged aluminum-containing antacid use. Ten study infants (mean age = 5.8 months), who had been receiving antacids for at least 1 week, were compared with 16 control infants (mean age = 9.8 months) not receiving antacids. The study patients consumed 123 +/- 16 mg/kg per day (mean +/- SEM) of elemental aluminum for an average of 4.7 weeks. Their plasma aluminum level (37.2 +/- 7.13 micrograms/L) was significantly greater than that of the control group (4.13 +/- 0.66 micrograms/L) (P less than .005). It is concluded that plasma aluminum levels may become elevated in infants with normal renal function who are consuming high doses of aluminum-containing antacids. The safety of antacids containing aluminum should not be assumed and they should be used judiciously in infants, with careful monitoring of the aluminum dose and plasma level. 
3	Intrapartum, intranasal cocaine use and acute fetal distress. A case report. Intrapartum, intranasal cocaine was used for relief of labor pains by a healthy woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy. Fetal hypoxemia and distress followed the event. A causal relationship between the intrapartum use of cocaine and the fetal distress was postulated. Cocaine abusers could benefit from hospitalization early in labor for close surveillance and monitoring, thus avoiding exposure to cocaine and its unpredictable systemic effects. 
5	Hypocalcemia and hypercalcitoninemia in critically ill children. To study Ca metabolism in critically ill children, we measured ionized Ca (Ca2+), parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, 25 hydroxycholecalciferol (25[OH] D3), 1-25 dihydroxycholecalciferol (1-25[OH]2D3, and gastrin levels in critically ill children and in healthy controls. Patients were considered hypocalcemic if Ca2+ was less than 1.1 mmol/L. Six (14%) of 45 patients were hypocalcemic. Five hypocalcemic patients were studied and were found to have higher calcitonin levels than normocalcemic patients and healthy controls and higher PTH levels than healthy controls. 25(OH)D3 and 1-25(OH)2D3 were not significantly different in the three groups of patients. Gastrin levels were low in critically ill patients, whether or not they were hypocalcemic. We conclude that hypocalcemia occurs frequently in critically ill children. It is associated with raised levels of calcitonin and PTH. The mechanism for the increase in calcitonin is unknown. 
5	Thromboxane A2 biosynthesis in acute asthma and after antigen challenge. Thromboxane A2 is a potent bronchial smooth muscle spasmogen in vitro, and it has been implicated in airway inflammation and in the genesis of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthma. We have examined the urinary excretion of a variety of products derived from thromboxane A2 (thromboxane B2, 2,3-dinor, and 11-dehydro-thromboxane B2) and prostacyclin (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha and 2,3-dinor-6-oxo-PGF1 alpha) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in patients admitted acutely to hospital with severe asthma and in atopic volunteers after bronchial antigen challenge. Urinary excretion of all thromboxane-derived products was markedly increased in a number of patients with severe acute asthma compared with that in a nonsmoking control population, in some cases approaching those previously described in myocardial infarction: TXB2, 31.6 +/- 12.0 versus 6.5 +/- 0.9; 2,3-dinor-TXB2, 79.0 +/- 19.2 versus 29.5 +/- 2.7; and 11-dehydro-TXB2, 234.3 +/- 65.3 versus 25.0 +/- 2.1 ng/mmol creatinine (p less than 0.001). Urinary prostacyclin-derived products were also significantly raised in acute asthma. In contrast, after inhaled allergen challenge in atopic volunteers, which caused significant bronchoconstriction, urinary excretion of thromboxane-derived products was not significantly elevated: TXB2, 5.6 +/- 1.1 versus 5.7 +/- 1.0; 2,3-dinor-TXB2, 41.2 +/- 12.5 versus 28.5 +/- 6.9; and 11-dehydro-TXB2, 69.8 +/- 17.6 versus 39.7 +/- 11.2 ng/mmol creatinine. In a separate experiment, less than 2% of exogenously administered TXB2 to the airway appeared as urinary thromboxane-derived products, suggesting that production of greater than or equal to 1 microgram of TXA2 in vivo would be required to increase urinary thromboxane excretion twofold. 
5	Cerebral atrophy in habitual cocaine abusers: a planimetric CT study. We compared cranial CTs of 35 habitual cocaine abusers, 16 self-reported 1st-time users, and 54 headache patients using linear planimetric measures. All patients met the following criteria: age 20 to 40 years, no polydrug abuse (including alcohol), HIV seronegativity, normal albumin level, and no history of any other neurologic disease. The sex ratios and ages were not significantly different in the 3 groups. The planimetric measurements and calculated indices of cerebral atrophy were significantly different in the habitual cocaine abusers compared with the 2 other groups of patients. There were no differences between 1st-time cocaine users and controls. Among the habitual cocaine abusers there was a positive correlation between the approximate duration of cocaine abuse and the calculated atrophy indices. The findings suggest that cerebral atrophy develops in chronic cocaine abusers, and the severity correlates with the duration of abuse. 
2	Melanosis of the esophagus. An endoscopic, histochemical, and ultrastructural study. Endoscopic, histological, and ultrastructural features of 21 cases of esophageal melanosis are described. These cases were detected during 1000 consecutive routine upper gastrointestinal endoscopies. Staining characteristics and ultrastructure of the pigment contained in the endoscopically visible lesions were found to be similar to those of true melanin. 
2	Hyponatraemia in patients with cirrhosis. Hyponatraemia occurs in nearly half of patients in hospital with cirrhosis and ascites, and is due to the excessive retention of free water which results from the kidney's inability to excrete it normally. The morbidity and mortality associated with hyponatraemia is largely attributable to central nervous system disturbances. The degree to which brain water content increases depends on the duration of hyponatraemia and on compensatory mechanisms. Altered steroid and peptide hormones in cirrhotic patients may contribute to the development of hyponatraemic encephalopathy, symptoms of which overlap with hepatic encephalopathy and uraemia. The occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis is unrelated to the rate of correction of hyponatraemia. The appearance of hyponatraemia in cirrhotic patients, long regarded as a poor prognostic sign, may be a function of unrecognized underlying impaired renal function. Therapy for hyponatraemia remains suboptimal. 
5	Ocular motor abnormalities from head trauma. Head injuries cause the hospitalization of 200-300 persons per 100,000 population per year. Ophthalmologists provide diagnostic and therapeutic care to those trauma victims with damage to the globe, optic nerve, orbit, and ocular motor system. Eye movements can be affected by damage at any level of the central nervous system or peripheral motor unit. Comprehensive ocular motor assessment of the trauma patient can substantially contribute to the understanding of the patient's injury, recovery, and rehabilitation. This review examines all aspects of head and face trauma that can lead to ocular motility disturbances. 
5	Genetic determination of cytomegalovirus-induced and age-related cardiopathy in inbred mice. Characterization of infiltrating cells. Carditis developed 7 days after the administration of murine cytomegalovirus to neonatal, young adult or aged mice of varying sensitivity to lethal infection with this virus. The inflammation persisted for up to 80 days, but infected myocardial cells were rare and were not seen after day 10. The inflammatory cells comprised macrophages (up to 30%) and T cells (up to 80%), with a high ratio of Lyt2+ to L3T4+ cells throughout. Although the H-2 genotype affects murine cytomegalovirus replication at the level of individual cells, and hence resistance to lethal infection, it did not determine resistance to cardiopathy per se. However BALB/c, BALB.B, and BALB.K mice developed persistent myocarditis regardless of age at infection, and age-related cardiopathy was frequent and severe in infected and uninfected mice. B10 and B10.BR mice also developed myocarditis after neonatal infection, but inflammation resolved rapidly after adult infection and age-related cardiopathy was correspondingly mild. C3H mice exhibited minimal carditis after neonatal or adult infection. However neonatal infection appears to accelerate age-related cardiopathy, which is severe in retired breeders of this strain. 
1	Cartilage removal prior to skin grafting in the triangular fossa, antihelix, and concha of the ear. Skin grafting onto a large area of exposed ear cartilage with irregular contours poses an increased risk of inadequate re-establishment of circulation. Removal of cartilage not needed for structural support before grafting following Mohs surgery on the triangular fossa, antihelix, and concha of the ear decreases the risk of recurrence of the carcinoma, and increases the chances for survival of the graft. 
4	Circadian rhythm of heart rate variability after acute myocardial infarction and its influence on the prognostic value of heart rate variability. This study examined heart rate (HR) variability in patients surviving acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to find the optimum time and duration of recording of the ambulatory electrocardiogram for the prediction of the risk of sudden cardiac death, or serious arrhythmic events, or both. Twenty patients (group I) who initially survived an AMI but later experienced serious events (death or symptomatic sustained ventricular tachycardia) during a 6-month follow-up were compared with 20 patients (group II) who remained free of complications for greater than 6 months after discharge. Groups I and II were matched with regard to age, gender, infarct site, ejection fraction, and beta-blocker treatment. HR variability was assessed in the 24-hour electrocardiograms recorded during the first 2 weeks after an AMI and in various portions of the complete 24-hour recording, with both the beginning and the length of the analyzed portion varied by 20 minutes (a total of 5,113 possibilities). The maximum reduction of HR variability in group I patients was systematically found when assessing HR variability in recordings starting approximately at 6 A.M. and lasting for approximately 8 hours. In the low-risk patient, the diurnal rhythm of HR variability is more marked than in the high-risk patient and the long-term components of HR variability due to the diurnal variation must be included in the measurement of HR variability when using it as a long-term predictor of risk from arrhythmic events after an AMI. 
1	Tanning salons: an area survey of proprietors' knowledge of risks and precautions. An area survey of tanning salon proprietors was conducted in a medium-sized midwestern city. Proprietors reported they were in compliance with federal safety regulations, but not all had age, frequency, or duration restrictions. Similarly, proprietors were not uniformly informing patrons of potential tanning hazards, including the possibility of skin cancer, and were not knowledgeable about the risk and benefits of tanning. Some establishments reported selling psoralens to patrons to enhance tanning. More explicit guidelines regarding the use of tanning equipment and more accurate consumer information are needed. 
4	Treatment of obstructive pneumatosis coli with endoscopic sclerotherapy: report of a case. The case of an 86-year-old man with cardiac and pulmonary failure, in whom pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis caused segmental obstruction of the sigmoid colon is described. The patient was treated with endoscopic puncture and sclerotherapy of the cyst walls in four sessions, giving endoscopic and radiologic regress of the lesions and symptomatic relief. 
5	Subtrochanteric fractures treated with interlocking nailing. In a prospective study of 31 subtrochanteric fractures treated with Grosse-Kempf interlocking nails with a followup period of at least 1 year, there was a 87.1% (27/31) union rate, and a union period of 4.2 +/- 1.8 months. Knee range of motion in 28 acute traumatic cases was on average 127.5 +/- 23.0 degrees. The significant complications included: nail breakage, 3.2% (1/31); nonunion without nail breakage, 9.7% (3/31); neglected femoral fracture with malunion, 3.2% (1/31). The interlocking nailing has the advantages of: a) closed method, b) weight-sharing principle, c) shortening prevention, d) non-rigid fixation. From the theoretical and clinical comparison among the various implants, we conclude that closed interlocking nailing is one of the better instruments for subtrochanteric fracture treatment, and moreover, the most reasonable of all. However, for the higher level subtrochanteric fractures, reconstruction-style locking nails should be chosen. 
5	Extensor tendon rupture after osteoarthrosis of the wrist associated with nonrheumatoid positive ulnar variance. Rupture of the extensor tendon after osteoarthrosis of the wrist associated with nonrheumatoid, positive ulnar variance is uncommon. Eight cases were seen in the last five years. They included five men and three women, whose ages ranged from 54 to 82 years (average, 70 years). In all the cases, roentgenograms revealed osteoarthrotic changes in the wrist and dorsal subluxation or dislocation of the ulnar heads. Seven cases had operations. Friction with the dorsally subluxated or dislocated ulnar head and the osteophytes surrounding it caused these tendons to rupture. It was impossible to use end-to-end sutures, so tendon transfers or tendon grafts were performed. The patients were evaluated one to four years after surgery. Three patients complained of some disability in their daily lives, notably, limited flexion of their fingers. It is important that during surgery the reconstructed tendons should not be strained excessively. 
5	Outcomes of pregnancy in a national sample of resident physicians BACKGROUND. Physically demanding, highly stressful work during pregnancy has been reported to cause a variety of adverse outcomes. It has been difficult, however, to separate the effects of work from those of socioeconomic status. METHODS. By means of a national questionnaire-based survey, we studied the outcomes of pregnancy during residency for 4412 women who graduated from medical school in 1985 and for the wives of 4236 of their male classmates, who served as controls. RESULTS. The rate of response to our survey was 87 percent (4412 of 5079) for the women residents and 85 percent (4236 of 4968) for the wives of the male residents. There were no significant differences in the proportion of pregnancies ending in miscarriage (13.8 percent for residents vs. 11.8 percent for their classmates' wives, P = 0.12), ectopic gestations (0.5 percent vs. 0.8 percent, P = 0.69), and stillbirths (0.2 percent vs. 0.5 percent, P = 0.20). There were 989 women residents and 1238 residents' wives whose first pregnancy during residency resulted in the live birth of a singleton infant. Although during each trimester the women residents worked many more hours than the wives of the male residents, the frequency of preterm births (less than 37 weeks' gestation) was similar: 6.5 percent for residents and 6.0 percent for residents' wives (odds ratio = 1.1; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.7 to 1.5). Infants who were small for gestational age (with birth weights less than the 10th percentile for gestational age) were born to 5.3 percent of the residents and 5.8 percent of the residents' wives (odds ratio = 0.9; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.3). Adjustment for factors that differed between the women residents and the wives of male residents resulted in odds ratios of 1.2 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.8 to 1.7) for preterm delivery and 0.9 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.3) for the delivery of an infant who was small for gestational age. However, the women residents more frequently reported having had preterm labor (11 percent vs. 6 percent), but not preterm delivery (6.5 percent vs. 6.0 percent); preeclampsia was also more common among the women residents (8.8 percent vs. 3.5 percent). CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that working long hours in a stressful occupation has little effect on the outcome of pregnancy in an otherwise healthy population of high socioeconomic status. 
4	High output failure in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy: a comparative study with dilated cardiomyopathy. Although few studies have reported on relatively preserved ventricular function in patient with peripartum cardiomyopathy, the condition is usually believed to have the typical low-output congestive hemodynamic pattern of the dilated congestive cardiomyopathies. Two groups of patients, 14 with peripartum cardiomyopathy and 12 with dilated congestive cardiomyopathy who were matched for gender and age, were studied. They had normal blood pressure and similar New York Heart Association functional class, nutritional status, thyroid function and routine laboratory evaluation. All patients were catheterized during stable in-hospital compensation of heart failure, which was achieved by bed rest, sodium restriction, and administration of digoxin and diuretics long (more than 3 months) after delivery. Significant differences (p less than 0.05) between patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy and those with dilated congestive cardiomyopathy were observed in regard to: (1) cardiac index: 3.34 +/- 1.36 L/min/m2 versus 2.24 +/- 0.72 L/min/m2, (2) systemic vascular resistance: 1713 +/- 567 dynes.sec.cm-5 versus 2194 +/- 603 dynes.sec.cm-5, (3) right ventricular stroke work index: 8.6 +/- 4.2 g.M/m2 versus 14.8 +/- 8.2 g.M/m2 in the peripartum cardiomyopathy and the dilated congestive cardiomyopathy groups, respectively. Three of the patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy had resting cardiac index values that were even higher than the normal upper limit for our laboratory (4.5 L/min/m2): 4.80, 5.70, and 5.63 L/min/m2. They also had nearly normal left ventricular ejection fractions: 0.68, 0.41, and 0.51, respectively. These results indicate that, unlike the common dilated cardiomyopathy, the hemodynamic pattern in patients with peripartum cardiomyopathy is not homogeneous, and some patients have high-output failure and near normal left ventricular function. 
3	Auras and subclinical seizures: characteristics and prognostic significance. The characteristics and prognostic significance of subclinical seizures and independent auras were studied in 40 patients with partial epilepsy who had long-term electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring with intracranial electrodes. Focal, restricted subclinical seizures were noted in 23 patients, and 11 patients experienced auras that were accompanied by ictal EEG discharges. Auras and subclinical seizures usually were identical in EEG appearance, but were distributed differently among patients. The subclinical seizures and auras usually had the same origin as complex partial seizures, but did not always reliably indicate complex partial seizure origin. Subclinical seizures and auras were of favorable prognostic significance for patients undergoing temporal lobectomy. A majority (greater than 80%) of individuals with subclinical seizures and auras were free of complex partial seizures after surgery, whereas a minority (29%) of patients without subclinical seizures and auras became free of complex partial seizures. 
1	Philadelphia chromosome and monosomy 7 in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. During an 8-year period, 3,638 children from institutions of the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) were diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Fifty-seven patients had Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph1) ALL. Blast cells obtained at diagnosis from 13 of these 57 cases (23%) were also found to have partial or complete monosomy 7 (-7). This subgroup of children with Ph1/-7 ALL was comprised primarily of older males with early B-lineage ALL. Bone marrow specimens from six Ph1/-7 patients were studied further using the polymerase chain reaction and primers that flank the ALL, and chronic myelogenous leukemia breakpoints to determine the molecular characteristic of the 9;22 translocation. Rearrangements were detected in RNA from bone marrow and/or peripheral blood cells of six patients, although four were in hematologic remission at the time of the analysis. Five cases showed the ALL breakpoint, while one child with Ph1/-7 showed the chronic myelogenous leukemia breakpoint. The induction failure rate was much higher in this subgroup (31%) as compared with Ph1-negative cases, and the projected duration of event-free survival reflected the aggressive nature of this subgroup because no children are projected to remain in remission at 2 years. ALL with both the 9;22 translocation and -7 appears to represent a unique and previously undescribed subgroup of childhood ALL associated with a particularly adverse outcome. Leukemic transformation in such patients may involve the interaction of a dominant oncogene (Ph1) and a tumor suppressor gene (-7). 
4	Non-invasive monitoring of finger arterial pressure in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon: effects of exposure to cold. We studied the effects of exposure to cold on finger arterial pressure (FAP) measured by a finger arterial pressure monitor in 15 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon and in 15 healthy volunteers. The cold exposure induced vasoconstriction of the peripheral vascular bed as judged by the plethysmograph of a pulse oximeter and had marked effects on FAP values compared with upper arm arterial pressure. Immediately after the cold exposure, FAP decreased significantly (P less than or equal to 0.01) in both groups. However, during the subsequent 20 min, FAP values increased in relation to upper arm pressure. Finally, FAP values were greater than upper arm pressure in the control individuals, but not in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon. These results have implications for non-invasive monitoring of arterial pressure by the finger pressure device. Clinically, significant problems may arise in the monitoring of FAP in patients with a systemic connective tissue disease affecting peripheral circulation. 
1	Left superior vena cava: a pitfall in computed tomographic diagnosis with surgical implications. We report 2 cases in which computed tomography of the mediastinum demonstrated an abnormality originally misinterpreted as lymphadenopathy but subsequently shown to represent a left superior vena cava. Misinterpretation may result in errors in optimum treatment and may complicate surgical exploration of the mediastinum. These 2 cases are presented to remind radiologists and surgeons of the possibility of this unusual anatomy. 
3	Pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst This report describes a case of symptomatic pituitary hemorrhage into a Rathke's cleft cyst in a 25-year-old woman. The literature on pituitary hemorrhage in nonadenomatous sellar tumors is reviewed. 
5	Pterygia: single-fraction postoperative beta irradiation. A retrospective evaluation was performed with records of 128 patients with 146 eyes that underwent applications of strontium-90 after pterygium excisions performed between 1982 and 1988. With a median follow-up of 13 months, 135 eyes were evaluable. Most pterygia (127 of 135) were treated with a single postoperative application of Sr-90 that delivered 3,000 cGy of beta radiation in one fraction. The actuarial freedom from relapse was 87%; all recurrences occurred within the first 18 months, and 46% of these within the first 3 months. Of the 13 recurrences, 10 have been re-treated with surgery and a second course of beta irradiation with excellent results. All eight eyes for which follow-up was available had no evidence of disease. The ultimate control rate was 96.3% for the series. Correlation of various treatment parameters, including age, bilaterality, prior recurrence, and interval from surgery to irradiation, was performed, and no statistically significant difference was seen. No serious complications have developed. Transient conjunctivitis and photophobia were almost universally seen, with five cases lasting beyond 5 months. The authors conclude that a single application of Sr-90 after surgery is effective and safe in managing pterygia. 
5	Interruption of professional and home activity after laparoscopic cholecystectomy among French and American patients. With a laparoscopic approach, patients can undergo cholecystectomy with a shorter hospitalization, minimal pain, and quicker recovery. It has not been demonstrated, however, that patients actually return to work after laparoscopic cholecystectomy faster than the traditional 4- to 6-week absence from work after a standard open procedure. A survey of 104 French and 84 American patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy revealed that postoperative discomfort was completely resolved in 2 weeks in 73% of French and 93% of American patients. All but 11 French and 5 American patients were back to normal home activities by 2 weeks after the operation. Of the 35 American and 40 French patients who had professional activity outside the home, 63% and 25%, respectively, returned to work within 14 days. Five (14%) of the American patients and 12 (30%) of the French patients returned to work 4 weeks or more after the operation. The amount of physical activity on the job correlated with the period off work, but, interestingly, at least six patients with very hard physical activity at work (including construction workers) were able to return to full work activity within 1 week. These data suggest that early return to work is possible and that pain resolves quickly after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The economic benefit of having patients back on the job quickly, however, may be less than expected until cultural norms change with regard to leave of absence after major surgery. 
1	Intraluminal pressure adjacent to left colonic anastomoses. A cumulative total of 89 h of pressure data was acquired from both sides of a left colonic anastomosis in 15 patients over a median period of 7 postoperative study days. Patients had a colonic ileus lasting 3-10 days and during this proximal and distal inactivity the intraluminal pressure remained within 6 mmHg of atmospheric pressure. After recovery of activity, pressures proximal to the anastomosis in excess of 10 mmHg occurred during less than 1 per cent of the recording time. Distal peak pressures were significantly elevated with respect to the proximal site (P less than 0.001). Two-thirds of the distal pressures recorded were between 10 and 20 mmHg and 98 per cent were less than 50 mmHg; the peak distal pressure was 90 mmHg. Four patients had distal repetitive tonic contractions creating a pressure difference across the anastomosis with a mean of 20 mmHg and a peak of 45 mmHg. Each contraction persisted for 15-20 min. Intraluminal pressures are unlikely to play a role in anastomotic dehiscence. 
4	Sudden death associated with undiagnosed Graves' disease. Hyperthyroidism may result in multiple symptoms attributable to an excess of thyroid hormone. We report a case of Graves' disease in association with sudden death in a previously healthy, undiagnosed young female. This case illustrates an unusual initial presentation of Graves' disease. 
3	Posterior interosseous nerve palsies. One hundred seventy patients with radial nerve disorders were reviewed at the Louisiana State University Medical Center over a 15-year period. Of these, 32 had involvement of the posterior interosseous nerve exclusively. Findings included weak wrist extension with a radial drift, inability to extend the fingers, paralysis of thumb extension, and weak thumb abduction. Causes included entrapment at the arcade of Froshe (14 patients), laceration (6 patients), fracture (6 patients), compression or contusion (3 patients), and loss associated with tumor (3 patients). The ratio of men to women was 2:1, and the right arm was involved twice as often as the left. Preoperative evaluation included physical examination, electrophysiological testing (electromyogram/nerve conduction velocity), and roentgenograms of the elbow and forearm. Of the 30 patients (2 patients had bilateral lesions), 26 underwent operation. In the operative series, all 28 nerves had a function of Grade 3 or more of a possible 5 after 4 years of follow-up. Seventeen had achieved Grade 4/5, and 7 had obtained Grade 5/5. At operation, 23 nerves were found to be in continuity. Fourteen lesions of nerves in continuity were associated with entrapment and, not unexpectedly, transmitted a nerve action potential with slowed conduction and low amplitude across the lesion. Four nerves in continuity that had lesions caused by injury had nerve action potentials and were treated by neurolysis, and another 4 had no nerve action potentials and were treated by graft or suture repair. Five injured nerves were not in continuity. Two could be repaired by end-to-end suture, and 3 required graft repair. A large ganglion cyst involving the posterior interosseous nerve was also resected. 
1	Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of treatment. In 58 breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) pretreatment characteristics, clinical course, and response to treatment were evaluated. Forty-four patients were uniformly treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Fourteen patients did not receive intraventricular treatment. In the intraventricularly treated group the median survival was 12 weeks. Multivariate analysis of the pretreatment characteristics of the intraventricularly treated patients demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to survival for age older than 55 years, lung metastases, cranial nerve involvement, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose less than 2.5 mmol/l, and CSF protein 0.51 to 1.0 g/l. Based on the significance of these predicting factors a prognostic index (PI) identified four groups of patients with a median survival of 43 weeks, 22 weeks, 11 weeks, and 3 weeks, respectively. After 6 weeks of intraventricular treatment 22 patients showed a neurologic improvement or stabilization, and nine patients showed a worsening of the neurologic signs, whereas 13 patients (30%) had already died. The responders had a median additional survival of 5 months versus 1 month for nonresponders. No relation was found between survival and intensity of the intraventricular treatment after the first 6 weeks of treatment. Almost all long survivors had also received systemic treatment for systemic disease, whereas most patients who died within 6 months did not receive systemic therapy. Radiation therapy had no influence on the survival time. Early death due to the intensive treatment occurred in three patients. In 11 of the 17 patients who survived more than 4 months an often seriously debilitating late neurotoxicity developed. The survival curve of the nonintraventricularly treated patients appeared to be essentially the same as the curve of the intraventricularly treated patients. Using the same PI the predicted survival time was also the same as in the intraventricularly treated group. It is concluded that survival in MC from breast carcinoma may be more dependent on some pretreatment characteristics than on treatment intensity. On the basis of these pretreatment characteristics the survival time seems to be predictable. Finally, late neurotoxicity due to aggressive treatment leads to impairment of the quality of life in more than 50% of the long survivors. The exact value of intraventricular and systemic therapy in patients with MC still has to be determined.
