Preservation of hearing in neurofibromatosis 2. Preservation of hearing in the neurofibromatosis 2 (central neurofibromatosis) patient has been infrequently documented. This goal can be attained in selected patients and should be more frequently accomplished in the future with improved diagnostic capabilities and improved surgical techniques. We report three patients in whom this elusive goal has been accomplished. 
Comparison of exercise testing with studies of coronary flow reserve in patients with microvascular angina. Abnormal small coronary artery function may cause limited coronary flow responses to stress, resulting in anginal symptoms and ischemia in some patients with chest pain despite angiographically normal coronary arteries. To assess the exercise hemodynamic correlates of coronary flow abnormalities measured in the cardiac catheterization laboratory, 105 patients with microvascular angina (defined as an increase in coronary vascular resistance during pacing stress after ergonovine administration in the absence of significant epicardial constriction and associated with provocation of the patient's typical chest pain) and 27 patients without any coronary flow abnormality (normal) were analyzed. Of the 105 patients with microvascular angina, 75 had normal electrocardiographic responses to treadmill exercise testing, 22 had ischemic responses, and eight had bundle branch block during exercise. All 27 normal patients had normal electrocardiographic responses to exercise. Patients with ischemic electrocardiographic responses (0 +/- 7%, p less than 0.01), and those with bundle branch block (-2 +/- 6%, p less than 0.01) had abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction responses to exercise compared with the normal group, who demonstrated an 8 +/- 6% increase in left ventricular ejection fraction by radionuclide angiography during exercise, and microvascular angina patients with a normal electrocardiographic response to exercise, who demonstrated a 5 +/- 7% increase in ejection fraction. Although the microvascular response to ergonovine was no different among the three microvascular angina exercise groups, the administration of dipyridamole caused less coronary vasodilation in those patients with apparently ischemic or bundle branch block responses to exercise compared with those with normal electrocardiograms during exercise. 
Natriuretic peptides as cardiac hormones in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The ventricle is a major site of synthesis and secretion of brain natriuretic peptide. To study synthesis, storage, and secretion of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) in the heart, we have measured BNP mRNA and BNP concentrations in the hearts of Wistar-Kyoto rats and also have investigated its secretion from the isolated perfused heart. The atrium expressed the BNP gene at a high level, and a considerable amount of BNP mRNA also was present in the ventricle, which corresponded to approximately 40% of the atrial BNP mRNA concentration. When tissue weight was taken into account, the total content of BNP mRNA in the ventricle was approximately threefold larger than that in the atrium, although the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) mRNA content in the ventricle was only 7% of that in the atrium. By contrast, the BNP concentration in the ventricle was 4.07 +/- 0.97 pmol/g, which was less than 1% of that in the atrium (451 +/- 86 pmol/g). The basal secretory rate of BNP from the isolated perfused whole heart was 49.3 +/- 6.1 fmol/min, approximately 60% of which was maintained even after atrial removal, whereas the secretory rate of ANP was reduced to less than 5%. We also studied age-matched spontaneously hypertensive rats-stroke prone. The rank order of the BNP mRNA concentration in the hearts of these rats was left ventricle greater than right ventricle greater than right atrium = left atrium, and the total BNP mRNA content and BNP secretory rate in the ventricle were twice as large as in Wistar-Kyoto rats. These results demonstrate that BNP is a novel cardiac hormone in rats and is predominantly synthesized in and secreted from the ventricle. This is in striking contrast to ANP, which occurs mainly in the atrium. The results also suggest possible pathophysiological roles of BNP in certain cardiovascular disorders. 
Randomized trial of salbutamol in acute bronchiolitis. To test whether nebulized salbutamol (albuterol) is safe and efficacious for the treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis, we enrolled 83 children (median age 6 months, range 1 to 21 months) in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. Participants received two treatments at 30-minute intervals of either nebulized salbutamol (0.10 mg/kg in 2 ml 0.9% saline solution) or a similar volume of 0.9% saline solution placebo. Outcome measures were the respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and a clinical score based on the degree of wheezing and retractions. Patients in the salbutamol arm had significantly greater improvement in clinical scores after the initial treatment (p = 0.04). There was no difference between the groups in oxygen saturation (p = 0.74); patients treated with salbutamol had a small increase in heart rate after two treatments (159 +/- 16 vs 151 +/- 16; p = 0.03). We conclude that salbutamol is safe and effective for the initial treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis. 
Altered stores of atrial natriuretic peptide in specific brain nuclei of NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats. Previous studies from our laboratories have demonstrated a selective increase in stores of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in the anterior hypothalamus of NaCl-sensitive spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-S) compared to NaCl-resistant Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls and have suggested that anterior hypothalamic ANP contributes to the pathogenesis of NaCl-sensitive hypertension in SHR-S by local inhibition of norepinephrine release. We have also observed blunting of cardiopulmonary and arterial baroreflex function in SHR-S compared to WKY. In the current study, ANP stores in 12 brain nuclei thought to participate in the pathogenesis of hypertension, including locus coeruleus (LC), A1/C1 area (A1/C1), nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), medial preoptic nucleus (MPON), suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), supraoptic nucleus (SON), anterior hypothalamic area (AHA), paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN), dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN), lateral hypothalamic nucleus (LN), and posterior hypothalamic area (PHA), were compared in 10-week-old male SHR-S and WKY rats following 3 weeks of 1% v 8% NaCl feeding. Individual brain nuclei were obtained by the micropunch technique and ANP content of bilateral brain nuclei from individual rats was measured by radioimmunoassay. ANP content was significantly decreased in NTS and LC and elevated in AHA of SHR-S compared to WKY rats on either diet. Dietary NaCl supplementation was associated with increased ANP content in PVN of both strains. These alterations in ANP content in SHR-S may be related to the reduced release of norepinephrine from nerve terminals in AHA and to the presumed central defect in baroreceptor function. 
Magnetic resonance imaging of temporomandibular joint after surgical treatment of internal derangement. Sagittal and coronal surface coil magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 21 patients who about 2 years earlier had surgery for temporomandibular joint internal derangement. Surgical procedure included disk repositioning (23 joints) and diskectomy (seven joints). At the time of reimaging, 20 joints showed recurrence of pain and 10 joints were asymptomatic. Extensive fibrous tissue was seen in the joint space and in the joint capsule in 13 of the 20 painful joints, whereas minimal fibrous tissue in the lateral capsule wall was seen in 3 of the 10 nonpainful joints. Fibrous tissue was surgically confirmed in 10 of the painful joints. Disk displacement was seen in 11 of the 23 joints that had surgical disk repositioning. Disk displacement was seen in both painful (9/17) and nonpainful joints (2/6). It was concluded that magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent method for postoperative imaging of the temporomandibular joint and that attention should be directed to the presence or absence and extension of the fibrous tissue in the joint space and in the joint capsule. 
Venous gangrene (phlegmasia caerulea dolens) complicating heart failure from severe mitral stenosis--a case history. Gangrene of the left upper limb was found to complicate severe mitral stenosis presenting with heart failure in a sixty-eight-year-old woman with a documented left atrial thrombus. Arterial obstruction as the cause of gangrene was excluded by Doppler-assisted assessment of the peripheral pulses. Venous gangrene can complicate severe mitral stenosis and must be distinguished from arterial embolization, in which urgent surgical treatment is imperative. 
Manifestations of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Cryptococcosis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Meningitis is the most frequent manifestation of infection with Cryptococcus neoformans; pneumonia due to this organism, though less frequently recognized, is also a significant entity. A retrospective review was performed of all patients seen at Duke University Medical Center between January 1981 and July 1989 who were infected with both human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and C. neoformans. Of 31 patients with these concomitant infections, 12 had cryptococcal pneumonia (10 definite and two presumptive cases). Eleven of these 12 patients had evidence of extrapulmonary cryptococcal disease as well. Chest radiography showed interstitial infiltrates in 11 instances. For ten of the 12 patients, pulmonary cultures were positive for C. neoformans. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from all five patients who underwent bronchoscopy yielded the organism. Acute-phase mortality from cryptococcosis was 42% among patients with pneumonia. Cryptococcal pneumonia in patients with AIDS is probably more common than has previously been recognized and typically presents as interstitial disease that may mimic other opportunistic infections. 
Expression of interleukin-4 receptors on early human B-lineage cells. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) regulates multiple stages of the antigen-dependent phase of B-cell development. However, its precise role in regulating B lymphopoiesis in bone marrow is not as well defined. We examined whether surface IgM- normal and leukemic human B-cell precursors (BCP) expressed IL-4 receptors using biotinylated IL-4. Constitutive expression of IL-4 receptors was detected on both normal and leukemic BCP. A higher percentage of normal BCP (82% +/- 15%) expressed IL-4 receptors compared with leukemic BCP (44% +/- 8%). Using mean fluorescent intensity as an indicator of receptor level on the IL-4 receptor positive cells, normal (91 +/- 41) and leukemic (44 +/- 37) BCP expressed comparable numbers of receptors. IL-4 induced the expression of CD23 on 30% of the leukemic BCP cases examined. IL-4 induced CD23 on surface IgM+ fetal bone marrow lymphoid cells but not on the surface IgM- normal BCP, despite the presence of detectable receptors on the surface IgM- cells. IL-4 did not stimulate proliferation of normal BCP, nor could it enhance the effect of recombinant IL-7 or low molecular weight B-cell growth factor. However, IL-4 increased the expression of surface IgM and surface Ig kappa on in vitro differentiated pre-B cells. Our collective results identify no role for IL-4 in the proliferation of normal or leukemic BCP, but identify a role in the enhancement of surface Ig expression during pre-B to B-cell differentiation. 
Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone alters the hypothalamic effects of morphine in the rat. Female rats exhibit a generalized refractoriness to opiate stimulation during periods of steroid-induced LH secretion. In the present study we evaluated that role of LHRH in this steroid-induced effect on opiate-responsiveness. Central administration to ovariectomized rats of native LHRH or the LHRH agonist [Des-Gly10]LHRH ethylamide causes a dose-dependent refractoriness to the hypothermic effects of morphine. The potency relationship of these two LHRH agonists in antagonizing morphine's effect was consistent with their potency in inducing LH release. Treatment of ovariectomized rats with estradiol benzoate and progesterone in a regimen which induces a preovulatory-like LH surge, antagonized morphine-induced hypothermia, and the LHRH antagonist [D-Phe2, Pro3, D-Phe6] LHRH, reversed the effects of the gonadal steroids. These results indicate that the LHRH secretory dynamics associated with the preovulatory surge of LH may serve to modulate opiate responsiveness and thereby could serve to couple behavioral, sensory, and autonomic events with this neuroendocrine response to gonadal steroids. 
Meningioma: the role of a foreign body and irradiation in tumor formation. A case of meningioma is reported. At the age of 18 years, the patient had undergone insertion of a Torkildsen shunt through a posteroparietal burr hole for obstructive hydrocephalus secondary to a tumor of the pineal region, of which no biopsy had been made. After the hydrocephalus was relieved, he underwent irradiation of the tumor. Thirty years later, he was treated for an intracranial meningioma wrapped around the shunt. The tumor followed the shunt in all of its intracranial course. Microscopy disclosed pieces of the shunt tube within the meningioma. The role of a foreign body and irradiation in the induction of meningiomas is discussed, and a comprehensive review of the literature is presented. 
Epibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia: a report of two cases. The simultaneous ipsilateral presence of an epibulbar choristoma and microphthalmia has rarely been reported. We present two such cases, one of which is associated with bone formation, and we consider a possible pathogenetic mechanism. 
Latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap for elbow extension. The latissimus dorsi mycocutaneous flap has developed a reputation for its versatility in both skin and soft tissue coverage and for restoration of elbow function in both flexion and extension. In a case presented, a large extra-abdominal desmoid was removed along with the entire deltoid and three-quarters of the triceps. The latissimus dorsi was elevated with a large overlying skin island and rotated on its neurovascular pedicle into the defect in the posterior shoulder and upper arm to replace the resected triceps and deltoid muscle, and to provide coverage in this region. 
Intensive therapy for small-cell lung cancer using carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, etoposide, mid-cycle vincristine, and radiotherapy. Forty patients with small-cell lung cancer (31 patients with limited-stage [LS] disease, and nine patients with extensive-stage [ES] disease but of good performance status) have been treated with an intensive therapy composed of carboplatin alternating with cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide with vincristine on day 14 of each carboplatin cycle. A maximum of six cycles were administered at 3 weekly intervals after the cisplatin combination and 4 weekly after the carboplatin combination. Prophylactic cranial irradiation was given with the first cycle of chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation with the third cycle. The median nadir for neutrophils was 0.47 x 10(9)/L and for platelets, 40 x 10(9)/L. Chemotherapy dosages were not reduced in response to myelosuppression, but treatment was delayed to allow blood count recovery. Sixty-eight percent of patients received all six cycles of chemotherapy, and there were four deaths associated with treatment-related neutropenia. Twenty-eight patients (70%) achieved a complete response (CR) when assessed 1 month after the end of treatment, and a further five patients (12.5%) had a partial response (PR). Median duration of CR was 16 months and of PR, 8 months. Cerebral metastases occurred in 20% of all patients and was the apparent sole site of relapse in 11% of the CR patients. The median survival of the total group was 14 months with an actual 2-year survival of 30% and a minimum follow-up of 28 months. 
Program to increase the accessibility of screening mammography--Rhode Island, 1987-1988. The Rhode Island Department of Health's (RIDH) Breast Cancer Screening Program (RIBCSP) was initiated in 1987; it includes a broad promotional effort targeting women and physicians, a strong quality-assurance program, reductions in the cost of the breast cancer screening examination, and a telephone appointment and tracking system for screening examinations and follow-up care. This report describes and summarizes an evaluation of the RIBCSP. 
The interferons. Mechanisms of action and clinical applications. The interferons (IFN) are one of the body's natural defensive responses to such foreign components as microbes, tumors, and antigens. The IFN response begins with the production of the IFN proteins (alpha, beta, and gamma), which then induce the antiviral, antimicrobial, antitumor, and immunomodulatory actions of IFN. Recent advances have led to Food and Drug Administration approval of five clinical indications for IFN. Interferon alfa is approved for hairy-cell leukemia, condyloma acuminatum, Kaposi's sarcoma in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and non-A, non-B (type C) viral hepatitis. Interferon gamma has properties distinctive from those of IFNs alpha and beta and is approved as an immunomodulatory treatment for chronic granulomatous disease. Promising clinical results with IFNs have also been reported for basal cell carcinoma, chronic myelogenous leukemia, cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, early human immunodeficiency virus infection, hepatitis B, and laryngeal papillomatosis. Future clinical uses of IFNs may emphasize combination therapy with other cytokines, chemotherapy, radiation, surgery, hyperthermia, or hormones. 
Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in children. The symptoms, findings, associated conditions, and treatment of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus were studied in 10 girls and one boy. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a benign but chronic condition of the anogenital area of girls and, less frequently, of boys. The characteristic lesions are hypo-pigmented plaques in a figure-of-8 pattern surrounding the vulva and anus and often involving the natal cleft. The affected hypopigmented skin is sharply demarcated from the normal skin. Hemorrhagic, bullous lesions are uncommon. Fissures and ulcers are seen on the labia, between the labia, and on the perineum, anus, and natal cleft in many children and on the glans penis in boys. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus causes painful defecation and anal and vulval bleeding. In two patients, one girl and one boy, anal stenosis due to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and laxative treatment developed. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus mimics sexual abuse and has led to false accusation and investigations. The anogenital lesions cleared in three patients at the ages of 9, 11, and 12 years, but lesions can persist into adulthood. 
Subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of headache during withdrawal from drug-induced headache. In a pilot study (5 patients) we investigated the effects of subcutaneous sumatriptan, a 5-HT1-like receptor agonist, on headache experienced during the withdrawal period of drug-induced headache. The pilot study indicated that the substance was effective mostly in patients who originally suffered from migraine. In a patient with tension headache the substance was less effective. In a second double-blind study on six migraine patients with severe drug-induced headache, the drug was highly effective in ameliorating headache and autonomic disturbances. Blood flow velocities measured in extracranial parts of internal and external carotid arteries by duplex-sonography and in middle cerebral and basilar arteries by transcranial Doppler showed no changes after administration of sumatriptan or placebo. This result suggests sumatriptan does not act primarily via constriction of the large cerebral arteries. 
Impaired diastolic function and coronary reserve in genetic hypertension. Role of interstitial fibrosis and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries. Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in rats with genetic hypertension is accompanied by abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness and impaired coronary reserve. Whether these functional defects are related to a structural remodeling of the myocardium that includes an interstitial and perivascular fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and medial thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries is uncertain. To address these issues, 14-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats with established hypertension and LVH were treated with low-dose (SLO group: 2.5 mg/kg/day, n = 11) or high-dose (SHI group: 20 mg/kg/day, n = 9) oral lisinopril for 12 weeks to sustain hypertension and LVH or to normalize arterial pressure and myocardial mass, respectively. When SHI and SLO groups were compared with age- and sex-matched 26-week-old untreated spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 11) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (n = 9), we found 1) normalization of blood pressure (p less than 0.005) and complete regression of LVH (p less than 0.005) in the SHI group and no significant blood pressure or LVH reduction in the SLO group, 2) complete regression of morphometrically determined myocardial interstitial and perivascular fibrosis in SHI and SLO groups (p less than 0.025) associated with normalization of diastolic stiffness, measured in the isolated heart (p less than 0.025), and 3) regression of medial wall thickening of intramyocardial coronary arteries only in the SHI group (P less than 0.005), accompanied by a normalization of coronary vasodilator reserve to adenosine (p less than 0.005). Thus, interstitial fibrosis and not LVH is responsible for abnormal myocardial diastolic stiffness, whereas medical wall thickening of intramyocardial resistance vessels, influenced by arterial pressure, is associated with impaired coronary reserve. 
Certified cause of death in children and young adults with cerebral palsy. The status of 732 children suffering from cerebral palsy from the South East Thames region (births from 1970-9) was ascertained at the end of 1989, and copies of death certificates of the 73 children who have died, aged 4 weeks to nearly 16 years, were obtained. Infantile cerebral palsy (ICD Code 343-) was coded as the underlying cause of death in only 16 (22%) cases. On 28 (38%) certificates there was no mention of any form of cerebral palsy, the proportion in which it was not mentioned increasing with age. In 20 (28%) cases the coded underlying cause of death was respiratory, hence in published national statistics the number of deaths from respiratory causes is inflated. A postmortem examination was known to have been performed in 23 cases, but the recorded information was in some cases limited to a 'terminal event'. The importance of good data on the death certificate, and the significance of published national statistics, need to be communicated to all those involved in the certification process if cerebral palsy and other chronic conditions, which raise the relative risk of death, are not to be under-represented. 
Necrotizing myopathy with pipestem capillaries, microvascular deposition of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC), and minimal cellular infiltration. Three adult patients, two with undifferentiated connective tissue disease and one with carcinoma, had a distinctive pathologic reaction pattern consisting of necrotizing myopathy, minimal cellular infiltration, and a microangiopathy with thick "pipestem" vessels and microvascular deposits of complement membrane attack complex. Quantitative analysis revealed focal capillary depletion. This pattern represents an immune-mediated microangiopathy and is distinct from that observed in other inflammatory myopathies. 
Primary intracerebral osteosarcoma. A 64-year-old man was admitted because of a rapidly progressive left side hemiparesis. A computed tomography scan showed a right side intrathalamic mass, partially calcified. Surgical specimen proved to be an osteosarcoma. The patient died 3 days later from an acute myocardial infarct. Autopsy failed to discover any other significant lesion. A review of the literature disclosed that this case might be the second published primary intracerebral osteosarcoma and the first with immunocytochemical analysis. 
Echographic characteristics of ocular toxocariasis. Ocular toxocariasis most commonly presents as one of three distinct clinical syndromes: endophthalmitis, localized posterior granuloma, or peripheral granuloma. Using standardized echography, the authors studied 11 toxocariasis patients presenting with one of these syndromes. Common echographic findings were noted in ten of these patients, and included: (1) a solid, high-reflective peripheral mass, (2) a vitreous band or membranes extending between the posterior pole and the mass, and (3) a traction retinal detachment or fold from the posterior pole to the mass. These findings were present in patients presenting with leukocoria or endophthalmitis, as well as in patients in whom the peripheral nematode lesion could be visualized clinically. In combination with the history, clinical examination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), standardized echography may be useful in establishing the diagnosis of ocular toxocariasis in cases of leukocoria in which nematode endophthalmitis is suspected. 
When migraine is more than a headache. Stroke in a young patient. Stroke rarely occurs in a young patient with migraine. Nevertheless, vascular headache can lead to catastrophic neurologic consequences, and severe headache associated with persistent neurologic deficits poses a complex diagnostic problem. 
The perception of angina in diabetes: relation to somatic pain threshold and autonomic function. Silent ischemia is common in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease. These patients may also have more subtle alteration in the perception of angina as reflected by prolongation of anginal perceptual threshold--the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression to the onset of chest pain during treadmill exercise. Silent ischemia may be associated with a generalized hyposensitivity to pain, although the pathophysiologic mechanism is obscure. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether diabetic patients with prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds are also hyposensitive to painful stimuli and to investigate whether this is associated with autonomic neuropathy. Nineteen diabetic and 25 nondiabetic patients with exertional angina were exercised on a treadmill to measure anginal perceptual threshold. Somatic pain threshold was measured by calf sphygmomanometry. The cuff was inflated rapidly until pain occurred, and six repeat inflations were done to test reproducibility. Because there was no significant difference between measurements (coefficient of variation = 0.156) the mean value for each patient provided a measure of somatic pain threshold. The diabetic group had a longer anginal perceptual threshold (138 +/- 64 seconds vs 34 +/- 51 seconds, p less than 0.001), which correlated positively with the somatic pain threshold (r = 0.5, p = 0.03); patients with more prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds tended to have higher somatic pain thresholds. In the diabetic group anginal perceptual (r = -0.3, p = NS) and somatic pain (r = -0.4, p = 0.05) thresholds tended to increase as the ratio of peak to minimal heart rate during the Valsalva maneuver fell below 1.21, but these variables were unrelated in the nondiabetic group. 
Effect of pregnancy and pain on cerebrospinal fluid immunoreactive enkephalins and norepinephrine in healthy humans. Endogenous spinal opioid or noradrenergic system activation may increase pain threshold during pregnancy and following a painful stress. Variation in spinal antinociceptive activity is also postulated to explain in part the large variability in postoperative opioid analgesic requirements. In this study, spinal noradrenergic and opioid activity, as reflected by the CSF concentrations of norepinephrine and immunoreactive enkephalins (total enkephalin-containing peptides), was determined in 58 women prior to surgery. The CSF concentration of these substances did not differ between pregnant and non-pregnant women. CSF norepinephrine tended to be greater in pregnant women who had experienced painful labor than in those who had not (1240 +/- 300 vs. 570 +/- 160 pmol/l; P = 0.056) and these women self-administered less morphine following cesarean section than those without labor pain (64 +/- 4 vs. 86 +/- 7 mg/24 h; P less than 0.01). However, CSF concentration of norepinephrine or immunoreactive enkephalins did not correlate with postoperative morphine use. These results suggest that spinal immunoreactive enkephalin and noradrenergic activity are not increased during pregnancy. However, pain may activate spinal noradrenergic pathways affecting pain sensation. 
Operative laparoscopy with the Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of endometriosis and pelvic adhesions. A multicenter, prospective trial was initiated to test the effectiveness and safety of the Nd:YAG laser equipped with artificial sapphire contact tips for the laparoscopic treatment of pelvic pain. Ninety-three women were enrolled in the study, 37 with endometriosis alone, 47 with endometriosis complicated by pelvic adhesions, and 9 women with adhesions alone. In over 90% of adhesions and 96% of endometriotic implants the Nd:YAG laser could be delivered to the site and be used to restore normal anatomy. The exception was deep bowel involvement with endometriosis, which was not treated. The majority of women had marked reduction or resolution of their symptoms for up to 12 months postoperatively. We conclude that the use of the Nd:YAG laser is an appropriate method to laparoscopically treat pelvic pain resulting from endometriosis or pelvic adhesions. 
Sinemet (CR4): an open-label study in moderately severe Parkinson's disease. Almost all patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease respond to levodopa and progress steadily, requiring an increased overall dosage with time. Sinemet CR4 offers a theoretically attractive method of achieving gradual sustained release of levodopa over time which may be more physiological to striatal dopamine receptors in the early stages of the disease. This study evaluated 20 patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's disease who were treated with Sinemet CR4 over a 1-year period. Eleven patients completed the full year on therapy, and nine subjects withdrew. Of the withdrawals, two subjects died from non-Parkinson's disease-related illness, three showed no therapeutic benefit, and four responded well for a minimal 6-month period, but then lost therapeutic benefit and developed more severe dystonias. A higher overall levodopa dosage was required by all patients, and side-effects of levodopa were still present in most patients. However, the nocturnal benefit of this long-acting preparation was observed by all the patients in the study. Slow onset of action of Sinemet CR4 resulted in early-morning immobility. Sinemet CR4 cannot replace standard Sinemet, but appears to be a useful form of adjunct therapy in selected patients. 
A randomized trial of chemotherapy followed by pelvic radiation therapy in stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix. Because of the poor results in stage III B carcinoma of the cervix with standard treatment using radiotherapy alone, we designed a randomized trial to determine whether administration of chemotherapy before pelvic irradiation would improve survival. Between May 1984 and August 1986, 107 patients with previously untreated squamous cell carcinoma were randomly assigned, after stratification by age (less than 50 v greater than 50 years), extent of parametrial involvement (unilateral v bilateral), and lymphangiographic findings (negative v positive) to pelvic radiotherapy (RT; arm A) or three cycles of chemotherapy (CT; bleomycin, vincristine, mitomycin, and cisplatin [BOMP]), followed by the same radiotherapy regimen (CT + RT; arm B). The groups were balanced by age, performance status, extent of parametrial involvement, bulkiness of cervical disease, nodal involvement, and presence of hydronephrosis. Minimal follow-up is 34 months. A complete local response was observed in 32.5% of the patients in arm A and in 47% of the patients in arm B (P = .19). Overall 5-year survival rates were 39% for the RT arm and 23% for the CT + RT approach (P = .02). Toxicity was severe in arm B and included fatal pulmonary toxicity in four patients. Locoregional and distant failures were similar in both groups. We conclude that, despite a satisfactory response rate, neoadjuvant BOMP chemotherapy adversely affects survival in stage III B cervical cancer and is associated with unacceptable toxicity. 
A new surgical approach to subcortical lesions: balloon inflation and cortical gluing. Technical note. A cortical incision performed with inflation of a balloon to create a channel has been used in an approach to deep lesions with minimal damage to cerebral tissue. The balloon is slipped over a blunt needle and, once in place, is inflated through the needle. Postoperative sealing of the incision with fibrin glue avoids the subdural collection of cerebrospinal fluid such as is sometimes observed when the ventricle is opened during surgery. 
Endoscopic sonography of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic sonography was used to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract of 550 patients referred for evaluation of abnormal findings seen on conventional endoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series, and CT. This essay illustrates the potential uses and limitations of this technique. Special emphasis has been given to the use of landmarks to facilitate orientation of the transducer in both the esophagus and stomach. Specific examples demonstrate involvement of individual layers of the bowel wall in both benign and malignant processes. It is stressed that this is a combined procedure requiring both an endoscopist and a radiologist. Endoscopic sonography is a valuable new technology with substantial potential in the evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
Health implications of obesity. The health risks of obesity increase with its severity and reach significance at a weight greater than 20% above optimal, by using life insurance tables, or at a body mass index greater than 27. Risks include hypertension, insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and, in some studies, high total-and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol. There is an increased mortality from endometrial cancer in women and from colorectal cancer in men. Chronic hypoxia and hypercapnia, sleep apnea, gout, and degenerative joint disease can occur with more severe obesity. The distribution of body fat is directly related to these health risks. Abdominal obesity is more dangerous than gluteal-femoral obesity because the amount of intraabdominal fat seems to determine much of the increased peril; therefore, risks of cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes increase with abdominal obesity, even independently of total fat mass. 
Good-quality semen recovered from a paraplegic man with physostigmine salicylate treatment. A case report. A subcutaneous injection of physostigmine was employed to treat paraplegic anejaculation. The sperm motility was greater than in previously reported studies in which electroejaculation techniques were used for seminal emission. 
Status epilepticus in benign rolandic epilepsy manifesting as anterior operculum syndrome. We report the fourth case of partial status epilepticus (SE) in benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes (BECRS). The child suffered long-lasting attacks involving the mouth and pharynx, clinically manifest as speech arrest, sialorrhea, and drooling. Both clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were compatible with the diagnosis of BECRS. Only during SE was the clinical picture similar to that observed in the operculum or Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome. SE remission was obtained with the usual antiepileptic drug therapy (diazepam, clobazam, valproate). EEG records showed additional patterns of continuous spike-waves during slow sleep and specific inhibition and blocking of interictal centrotemporal spikes by mouth and/or tongue voluntary movements. 
Bleeding time prolongation and bleeding during infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in dogs: potentiation by aspirin and reversal with aprotinin. Thrombolytic therapy is associated with a bleeding tendency that may be exacerbated by adjunctive antiplatelet agents. The effect of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) alone or in combination with aspirin on serial measurements of template bleeding time, ex vivo platelet aggregation and coagulation factors and the frequency of bleeding was studied in dogs. During infusion of rt-PA (15, 30 or 60 micrograms/kg per min for 90 min), a dose-related increase in bleeding time was observed. In a randomized blinded study of 25 dogs, the baseline bleeding time (mean +/- SD) was 3.5 +/- 1 min in control animals and 4 +/- 2 min after oral aspirin (15 mg/kg body weight). Infusion of rt-PA (15 micrograms/kg per min for 90 min) prolonged the bleeding time to a maximum of 15 +/- 12 min. In contrast, combined aspirin and rt-PA therapy produced an increase to greater than 30 min during infusion, reverting to 13 +/- 10 min within 2 h after cessation of infusion. Recurrent continuous bleeding from incision sites occurred in one of six dogs given aspirin alone, two of seven given rt-PA alone and all six dogs given both aspirin and rt-PA (p = 0.02). Bleeding time greater than 9 min correlated significantly with bleeding frequency (p less than 0.0001), with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 87%. Intravenous bolus injection of aprotinin (20,000 kallikrein inhibitor units/kg body weight) in six dogs given both rt-PA and aspirin produced a decrease in bleeding time from greater than 30 min to 9.5 +/- 9 min and resulted in cessation of bleeding. Thus, bleeding and bleeding time prolongation in this canine model are potentiated by a marked interactive effect of rt-PA and aspirin that is rapidly reversible. Template bleeding times may provide a useful quantitative index for monitoring the bleeding tendency associated with thrombolytic therapy. 
Whole-abdominal irradiation for the management of gastrointestinal and abdominal manifestations of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. A patient with a long-standing history of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia developed weight loss and ascites secondary to gastric/small bowel infiltration and peritoneal implants of myeloid tissue. Moderate doses of radiation were very effective in controlling her gastrointestinal symptoms. In contrast to previous reports, clinical improvement after irradiation was a slow, gradual process, requiring 5 months for complete resolution of the patient's ascites. Hematologic suppression may be profound and careful attention to the rate of change in leukocyte and platelet counts is necessary to avoid severe toxicity. 
Abnormal methylation of the calcitonin gene marks progression of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The clinical aspects of disease progression in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) are well established, but the nature of the molecular events responsible is not known. We have previously reported a consistent pattern of novel sites of methylation in the 5' region of the calcitonin (CT) gene and other chromosome 11p loci in acute myelogenous and and lymphoid leukemias. In the present study, CT gene methylation patterns were investigated in peripheral blood from 51 patients with CML. Abnormal patterns were found in only 2 of 31 patients in chronic phase, but in 5 of 8 patients in accelerated phase, and in 11 of 12 patients in blast crisis (P less than .005). For one patient studied in blast crisis, abnormal CT gene methylation was found in the peripheral blast cells but not in the granulocytes. In two of three patients studied with CML and having normal peripheral cell patterns, abnormal patterns were found in marrow blast cells. In one patient, only partial normalization of the CT gene methylation pattern was seen after chemotherapy induction of a second chronic phase and the patient relapsed 5 months later. Our findings indicate that abnormal methylation of the 5' region of the CT gene is regularly a marker of disease progression in CML which may prove clinically useful. This abnormal methylation site is part of an imbalance in DNA methylation that may play a role in the progressive genetic instability which characterizes the advancing stages of CML. 
Obliteration of the fat surrounding the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery is not a specific CT finding of carcinoma of the pancreas. Partial or complete obliteration of the fat surrounding the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery on CT is considered so characteristic of pancreatic carcinoma that many consider it diagnostic. However, this finding may be present on CT scans of some treatable tumors. During a 2-year period, we retrospectively collected 10 cases of nonpancreatic tumors that obliterated the fat surrounding the celiac axis and/or superior mesenteric artery. Four patients had metastatic disease, three had lymphoma, two had primary small-bowel adenocarcinoma, and one had a diffuse retroperitoneal endocrine tumor. The scans were analyzed for presence, location, and morphology of the mass and biliary and/or pancreatic ductal dilatation. Of the patients with metastatic disease, three had focal, retropancreatic, periceliac masses without ductal dilatation. One had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process enveloping the pancreas and causing biliary dilatation. Of the patients with lymphoma, two had focal masses in the mesenteric root without ductal dilatation, and one had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process. Of the two patients with primary carcinoma of the small bowel, one had a mesenteric mass without ductal dilatation and the other had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process enveloping the pancreatic head and obstructing the ducts. The patient with the neuroendocrine tumor had an infiltrative retroperitoneal process enveloping the pancreas without ductal dilatation. Obliteration of the fat surrounding the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery is not a specific CT finding of carcinoma of the pancreas. One cannot rely solely on its presence for the diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma but should use other important findings such as a focal pancreatic mass and ductal dilatation. 
Combination of cimetidine and alginic acid: an improvement in the treatment of oesophageal reflux disease. Cooperative Oesophageal Group. A new chewable tablet containing cimetidine 200 mg and alginic acid 500 mg, at a dosage of one tablet four times daily, was compared in a 12 week randomised study with the standard dosage of cimetidine (400 mg four times daily) in the management of oesophageal reflux disease. The dose of cimetidine continued unchanged throughout the study but the dose of the combination drugs could be increased after six weeks to two tablets four times a day if response was unsatisfactory. A total of 312 patients had data suitable for analysis. Sixty three per cent of those on the combination tablet completed the study without increasing their dose - that is taking cimetidine equivalent to half the standard dosage used in the control group. The improvement in heartburn symptoms was significantly greater in the combination group than in the group taking full dose cimetidine. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in healing and improvement of the appearances of oesophagitis after 12 weeks, and healing rates were as expected from previous studies. The addition of alginic acid to cimetidine in this fixed combination tablet is an improvement in symptomatic treatment of oesophageal reflux disease. 
Reducing the risk of stroke: identifying patients to refer for carotid endarterectomy. The most common causes of stroke are two diseases of aging: hypertension and atherosclerosis. Therefore, although stroke may occur at any age, the incidence is highest among the elderly population. Noninvasive efforts to reduce the risk of stroke in the elderly include control of hypertension and diabetes, smoking cessation, low-cholesterol dietary habits, and moderate exercise. Routine low-dose aspirin also provides some protective effect. High-risk patients (with asymptomatic high-grade stenosis, TIAs, or prior stroke) should be considered candidates for carotid endarterectomy in the absence of contraindications to surgery. 
Remission of hepatitis B-associated membranous glomerulonephritis in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been associated with several renal diseases, the most common being membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN). The role of concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in affecting the course of the renal involvement is largely unknown. We report the case of a HIV-infected adult male with chronic HBV-associated MGN who had complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome associated with spontaneous seroconversion from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive to HBeAg-negative. The present case illustrates that HIV infection does not preclude improvement of chronic HBV infection or an associated membranous nephropathy. Such improvement may be dependent on the ability of the host immune system to clear HBeAg. 
Tumor proliferative fraction in solid malignant neoplasms. A comparative study of Ki-67 immunostaining and flow cytometric determinations. Tumor proliferative fraction (TPF) has been shown to correlate with prognosis in some malignancies. A method for its determination that is practical, accurate, and reproducible is still being sought. In this comparative study of techniques, TPF values were determined in mirror-image samples of 126 consecutive solid malignant neoplasms using flow cytometry and immunostaining with Ki-67, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an unknown nuclear antigen expressed during the entire cell proliferation cycle but not in resting cells. The mean TPF values for all cases were 19.5 +/- 15.6% (percentage of tumor cells stained) by Ki-67 (range, 1-86%) and 15.7 +/- 9.6% (S + G2M) by flow cytometry (range, 3-60%), which correlated significantly at r = 0.53 and P = 0.005. The correlation was less strong in tumors with low S-phase values (less than or equal to 10%, r = 0.28) than in tumors with intermediate and high S-phase values (r = 0.66). Ki-67 staining percentages did not correlate with patient age, sex, or tissue origin of the tumor. Ki-67 staining appears comparable to flow cytometry determination of TPF in solid malignancies with intermediate and high S-phase values. In tumors with low S-phase values, Ki-67 immunostaining shows higher TPF values, which perhaps reflect an increase in the proportion of G1-phase cells or dilutional effect of nonneoplastic cells in the tumors with low proliferative fraction. 
Effective thrombolysis without marked plasminemia after bolus intravenous administration of vampire bat salivary plasminogen activator in rabbits BACKGROUND. The use of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in thrombolytic therapy is frequently associated with significant fibrinogenolysis. In contrast, recombinant vampire bat salivary plasminogen activator (Bat-PA) displays strict fibrin specificity, an attribute that could be desirable in a fibrinolytic agent. METHODS AND RESULTS. The efficacy and fibrin selectivity of Bat-PA was evaluated and compared with that of t-PA using a rabbit model of femoral arterial thrombosis. Administration of 8.1, 14, and 42 nmol Bat-PA/kg by bolus intravenous injection restored flow in 50%, 75%, and 80% of the rabbits, respectively. The incidence of reperfusion after bolus intravenous injection of 14 and 42 nmol t-PA/kg was 15% and 78%, respectively. The maximal femoral artery reperfusion flows were equivalent after treatment with 42 nmol Bat-PA/kg or 42 nmol t-PA/kg, but the time to reach maximal flow for Bat-PA was approximately one half that of t-PA. Furthermore, the rapid restoration of flow by 42 nmol Bat-PA/kg, in contrast to equimolar t-PA, was accomplished without fibrinogenolysis and with only small decreases in the plasminogen and alpha 2-antiplasmin levels. Equipotent doses of Bat-PA and t-PA both resulted in approximate 2.5-fold increases in the template bleeding times of aspirin-pretreated rabbits. The clearance of Bat-PA from rabbits exhibited biexponential elimination kinetics; approximately 80% was cleared by the relatively slow beta phase (half-life of 17.1 minutes). Overall, Bat-PA was cleared approximately fourfold slower than t-PA. CONCLUSIONS. Bolus intravenous administration of Bat-PA would facilitate prompt initiation of thrombolytic therapy, and the avoidance of plasminemia could result in fewer and less severe bleeding complications. 
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinic-initiated, Canadian multicenter trial of topical edoxudine 3.0% cream in the treatment of recurrent genital herpes. Canadian Cooperative Study Group. Treatment for recurrent genital herpes using edoxudine 3% cream for 5 days was evaluated in 200 patients in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinic-initiated trial. Lesion tenderness was predictive of and more sensitive and longer-lasting than the symptom of pain. Among patients receiving placebo, times to crusting (P = .043), cessation of investigator-observed signs (P = .005), lesion-associated signs (P = .02), and groin signs (P = .05) were longer in women. Edoxudine reduced viral shedding in men (mean 2.7 vs. 3.4 days, P = .009) and women (2.0 days vs. 3.5 days, P = .0001). Loss of investigator-observed signs (4.4 vs. 6.2 days, P = .002), investigator-observed lesion tenderness (P = .01), lesion signs (P = .02), groin adenopathy (P = .01), and tenderness (P = .01) occurred earlier in women taking edoxudine. Edoxudine was well-tolerated and reduced several signs of herpes in women. Its clinical role in recurrent genital herpes remains to be fully determined. 
Pathologic fibrosis and matrix connective tissue in the subaortic myocardium of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. To evaluate scar-type and matrix connective tissue and to assess their role in the diastolic dysfunction of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, surgically resected subaortic myectomy specimens and several autopsy hearts from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were studied. Eighteen specimens were differentially stained by a newly developed method that precisely determines relative collagen content; these tissues were compared with postmortem hypertrophied and normal control subaortic specimens. Quantitation revealed a 72% higher level (36.5 vs. 22.1 micrograms collagen/mg protein) of stainable collagen in the hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than in hypertrophied control hearts. The endocardial plaque was quantitated morphometrically, and it constituted only 4.6 +/- 1.7% of the total increased collagen content in the cardiomyopathy specimens. For the matrix studies, the cardiomyopathy specimens were stained by a silver impregnation technique that identifies connective tissue elements not normally visible with routine histologic methods. There was a marked increase in content of all matrix components, both in areas of pathologic scarring and in "normal" zones. Whorls of matrix connective tissue were noted in regions of myocyte whorls, as well as independent of them. Thus, these studies revealed a striking increase of both scar-type and matrix connective tissue in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The extensive scarring and the pronounced interstitial and intercellular matrix connective tissue may contribute to the increased ventricular chamber stiffness and impaired relaxation in this disease. 
Astroviruses as a cause of gastroenteritis in children. BACKGROUND. Infection with astroviruses has been associated with gastroenteritis in children, and serologic surveys indicate that this infection may be frequent. The importance of astroviruses as agents of gastroenteritis has not been shown in a controlled study, however. METHODS. We used monoclonal antibody-based enzyme immunoassays to detect astroviruses, enteric adenoviruses, and rotaviruses in stool samples obtained from age-matched children with and children without gastroenteritis. The samples were obtained in two studies, three years apart, among patients attending an outpatient clinic in Bangkok, Thailand. RESULTS. In the first study, astroviruses were detected in 8.6 percent (96 of 1111) of the children with gastroenteritis and in 2.0 percent (19 of 947) of the children without gastroenteritis. In the second study the rates were 8.6 percent (50 of 580) and 2.1 percent (11 of 512), respectively. For both studies combined, enteric adenoviruses were detected in 2.6 percent of those with gastroenteritis and in 0.5 percent of the controls, whereas rotaviruses were detected in 19 percent of those with gastroenteritis and in 1.0 percent of the controls. The clinical findings associated with astrovirus infection were similar to those associated with rotavirus infection, except for a trend toward greater dehydration in the children infected with rotaviruses. CONCLUSIONS. These two controlled studies involving a total of 3150 Thai children provide evidence that astroviruses are a common cause of viral gastroenteritis. Astroviruses were found in association with gastroenteritis more frequently than were enteric adenoviruses, and with nearly half the frequency of rotaviruses. 
Lipolytic response to metabolic stress in critically ill patients. OBJECTIVE: To measure whole-body lipolysis and fatty acid re-esterification in critically ill patients. DESIGN: The rates of appearance of glycerol and palmitic acid in blood plasma were measured by infusing stable isotope tracers [2H5]glycerol and [1-13C]palmitic acid, respectively. Energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. SETTING: Medical ICU of The University of Texas Medical Branch Hospital, a university-based referral center. PATIENTS: Five uninjured critically ill patients. Four patients were hospitalized because of respiratory insufficiency and one because of myocardial infarction. Three patients died during their hospitalization. INTERVENTIONS: Metabolic studies were performed in each patient after an overnight (12-hr) fast. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Mean +/- SE glycerol and fatty acid rates of appearance were 4.5 +/- 1.0 and 11.5 +/- 0.8 mumol/kg.min, respectively. The ratio of fatty acid to glycerol rate of appearance was 2.9 +/- 0.5. Resting energy expenditure was 132 +/- 6% of predicted. CONCLUSIONS: An accelerated rate of lipolysis is part of the metabolic response to severe stress, regardless of its etiology. Because the rate of fatty acid release far exceeded energy requirements, fatty acids that were not oxidized as fuel were re-esterified to triglyceride, presumably in the liver. 
Definition and measurement of fatigue. Although fatigue is a key component of the chronic fatigue syndrome, its definition and measurement remain relatively undeveloped. Most research on fatigue has been oriented towards work or performance of tasks and has involved laboratory studies of healthy individuals, while the study of fatigue as encountered in clinical settings has received minimal attention from investigators. This paper recommends that the natural history of chronic fatigue in its various clinical presentations be studied and that standardized assessment tools be used in this process. An investigation of the tools available for the assessment of fatigue yielded single-item, unidimensional, and multidimensional instruments. Additionally, the apparent association between affective illness and the chronic fatigue syndrome is addressed, and the fact that this relationship depends on issues of measurement is explored. 
Five-hour balloon inflation to resolve recurrent reocclusion during coronary angioplasty [published erratum appears in Cathet Cardiovasc Diagn 1991 May;23(1):71] A 63-year-old male presented with an acute inferior myocardial infarction with initial clinical reperfusion following thrombolysis. Due to recurrent reocclusion, emergency catheterization was performed, demonstrating a 90% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery. Angioplasty was complicated by multiple reocclusions, ultimately requiring 5-h autoperfusion balloon inflation to maintain patency. 
Symptomatic treatment versus combination chemotherapy for patients with extensive non-small cell lung cancer. In a randomized clinical trial, 87 patients with inoperable, extensive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomized to receive either combination chemotherapy (cisplatin at 70 mg/m2 intravenously [i.v.] on day 1 and etoposide at 100 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 and 200 mg/m2 orally on days 2 and 3) or symptomatic treatment. No statistically significant differences in survival time were found between the two treatment techniques. A major problem in the interpretation of the results was the use of semicurative radiation therapy (3000 to 4200 cGy) to the primary tumor and mediastinum, which was given with symptomatic intent. Three long-term survivors were seen in the latter group. 
Acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy. We studied 13 patients with supranuclear lower cranial nerve ("pseudobulbar" or "suprabulbar") palsy of acute onset. While seven patients had had a prior stroke, six patients had no history of stroke. Eight patients experienced a complete bilateral supranuclear lower cranial nerve palsy, which was isolated in five patients and associated with hemiplegia and with hemiparesis in three patients. Pseudobulbar palsy was partial in five patients. Only one patient had neuropsychologic impairment. The pseudobulbar features improved or recovered within a few weeks in all patients. The common characteristic of the lesions on computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was the interruption of the corticonuclear pathways contrasting with marked sparing of the corticospinal pathways in both hemispheres. These lesions were either an opercular infarct, or a deep infarct in the corona radiata or internal capsule, or a lenticular hemorrhage. Hypertension was the most prevalent concomitant. Our findings suggest that acute pseudobulbar or suprabulbar palsy has rather stereotyped anatomic-vascular correlates and time course. 
Cell associated urokinase activity and colonic epithelial cells in health and disease. It is not known if urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is associated with normal colonic epithelial cells. The aims of this study were to determine if normal colonic epithelial cells have uPA activity and whether this is concentrated at the cell membrane. In addition, the contribution of colonic epithelial cell associated uPA activity to disease related pertubations of mucosal uPA activity were examined. A highly enriched population of colonic epithelial cells was isolated from resected colon or biopsy specimens by an enzymatic technique. uPA activity was measured in cell homogenates by a specific and sensitive colorimetric method and expressed relative to cellular DNA. In two experiments subcellular fractionation of colonic epithelial cells was performed by nitrogen cavitation followed by ultracentrifugation over a linear sucrose gradient. The fractions collected were analysed for uPA and organelle-specific enzyme activities. Normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity (mean (SEM) 5.6 (1.1) IU/mg, n = 18). This colocalised with fractions enriched for leucine-beta-naphthylamidase and 5'-nucleotidase, markers of plasma membrane. uPA activities in epithelial cells from cancerous colons (9.8 (3.1) n = 7) or from mucosa affected by inflammatory bowel disease (3.8 (0.7) n = 15) were not significantly different from normal (paired t test), while that in epithelial cells from greatly inflamed mucosa was similar to that from autologous normal or mildly inflamed areas (4.4 (1.2) v 5.9 (3.6), n = 9). Thus normal colonic epithelial cells have cell associated uPA activity which is concentrated on the plasma membranes, suggesting the presence of uPA receptors. 
Formation of the tetraploid intermediate is associated with the development of cells with more than four centrioles in the elastase-simian virus 40 tumor antigen transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer [published erratum appears in Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1991 Sep 15;88(18):8282] The development of pancreatic cancer in transgenic mice expressing the simian virus 40 tumor antigen placed under controlling regions of the elastase I gene is characterized by the sequential appearance of tetraploid and then multiple aneuploid cell populations. Pancreatic tissues from such transgenic mice were studied between 8 and 32 days of age. Virtually 100% of acinar cell nuclei had immunohistochemically detectable tumor antigen by 18 days. Tetraploid cells were demonstrated by DNA content flow cytometry by 20 days and were associated with the appearance of interphase cells that had 5-11 centrioles per cell in single thin sections of pancreatic tissue examined by electron microscopy. Mitotic cells also were observed that had 5 or more centrioles per cell that were incorporated into the poles of bipolar or at least tripolar spindle apparatuses. These observations indicate that formation of the tetraploid intermediate in the diploid----tetraploid----aneuploid sequence of pancreatic tumor formation in elastase-simian virus 40 tumor antigen transgenic mice is accompanied by the development of cells with 5 or more centrioles that can be incorporated into the poles of abnormal mitotic spindles. We speculate that cells with more than 4 centrioles are predisposed to the formation of multipolar mitoses that may yield daughter cells with chromosomal gains and losses, resulting in the subsequent development of aneuploid tumors. 
Receptor-mediated endocytosis of an extracellular steroid-binding protein (TeBG) in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Previous studies suggested that an extracellular steroid-binding protein, testosterone-estradiol-binding globulin (TeBG), can enter a variety of cells. Experiments were conducted to determine whether uptake of TeBG occurs by nonspecific fluid phase endocytosis or via a specific receptor-mediated process. In human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7) maintained on serum-free medium, exposure to radiolabeled TeBG resulted in cellular uptake, which reached a plateau by 6 h and could be inhibited 80% by competition with unlabeled TeBG. Uptake was temperature dependent with cell-associated radioactivity at 37 C being 1.6-fold higher than at 4 C. Subsequent exposure of cells to pronase resulted in release of the cell-associated TeBG by 88% and 44% at 4 C and 37 C, respectively. After transfer to media devoid of TeBG, approximately 35% of cell-associated radioactivity was release into the medium at 37 C; it was not possible to distinguish whether this was released from the cell surface or from inside the cell. Investigation of the localization of TeBG-gold complexes by electron microscopy revealed that TeBG first binds to the plasmalemma. Within 15 min label appears in receptosomes, which fuse to form multivesicular endosomes. By 1 h all label is observed in multivesicular endosomes and lysosomes, most of which are in the Golgi zone. Localization of the internalized radioactivity using classical cell fractionation techniques showed it appears in a symmetrical band exhibiting the same buoyant density as the lysosomal marker acid phosphatase. The observations reported here show that: 1) TeBG binds to MCF-7 cells; 2) some of the bound TeBG is taken up via a mechanism with all the characteristics of receptor-mediated endocytosis; and 3) within these cells TeBG is localized in endosomes and lysosomes. 
Physical overdistension converts ventricular cardiomyocytes to acquire endocrine property and regulate ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide production. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is present in adult atria but at very low concentrations in normal adult mammalian ventricles. In the atria, the production of ANP is regulated by physical distension of the atrial wall. The same phenomenon was investigated in the ventricles of rats and men. Cardiac tissues from human ventricular aneurysm (n = 5), spontaneously hypertensive rats (n = 30), and rats that had overloaded left ventricles induced by surgery (n = 84) were studied with the methods of light microscopic immunocytochemistry, electron microscopic immunogold staining, and RNA-RNA tissue in situ hybridization. It was found that the levels of ANP gene expression, ANP immunoreactivity, and ANP-containing specific granules in the overburdened ventricles were elevated and their degrees of fluctuation were directly proportional to the force of physical distension applied to the ventricular cardiomyocytes. In rats, ANP mRNA and ANP immunoreactivity returned to the control level seven days after the ventricular overload was surgically released. The changes of ANP and its mRNA in the ventricles were related more closely to the changes of intraventricular pressure than to cardiocytic hypertrophy. In addition, ANP immunoreactivity was demonstrated in Purkinje cells and periarteriolar cardiomyocytes in the ventricles of normotensive rats. In conclusion, physical overstretch of the ventricle wall is likely to be the triggering factor affecting ventricular cardiomyocytes to acquire endocrine property, and also to regulate the production of ventricular ANP, thereby contributing to the control of the blood volume and the blood pressure. 
Vitamin K therapy in severe liver disease. A middle-aged man with parenchymatous liver disease and a decrease in vitamin K-dependent factors was given large doses of intravenous phylloquinone (10 mg/d for 20 days) without improvement in the synthesis of vitamin K-dependent factors. During subsequent liver transplantation, he exsanguinated. Although the exact role of over treatment with phylloquinone in this case is unclear, plasma levels of phylloquinone 300 times normal were attained after 5 days of treatment without effect on factors II, VII, IX, and X. Further therapy with vitamin K was unnecessary. 
Dichotic listening failure in dysphoric neuropsychiatric patients who endorse multiple seizure-like symptoms. In the present investigation, the dichotic word listening performance of a sample of 25 dysphoric neuropsychiatric patients who endorsed multiple partial seizure-like symptoms was compared with that of matched samples of normal controls and patients with mood disorders who did not endorse multiple seizure-like symptoms. Eighty percent of the patients who endorsed multiple episodic phenomena failed the dichotic listening task, compared with 8% of normal controls and 28% of patients with typical mood disorders. After treatment with carbamazepine, a subsample of polysymptomatic patients manifested significantly fewer seizure-like symptoms. This clinical improvement was typically associated with markedly improved dichotic listening performance in most cases. The results are consistent with our previous hypothesis that "subclinical" electrophysiological dysfunction may severely disrupt the normal transmission and processing of auditory information. Because it is sensitive to this type of presumed cerebral dysfunction and relatively specific, impaired dichotic listening performance is likely to be a useful clinical marker for this complex neuropsychiatric syndrome. 
Sciatic nerve entrapment in a child. Case report. A child was brought for evaluation of signs of unilateral chronic progressive sciatic nerve dysfunction found to be due to nerve entrapment in the thigh by a fibrovascular band. Sectioning of the band was followed by marked improvement in the nerve function. Compression by a band is a rare but treatable cause of sciatic neuropathy. 
Memory T cells represent the predominant lymphocyte subset in acute and chronic liver inflammation. T cells can be divided into two main phenotypic subpopulations-i.e., the CD45RA-positive (2H4-positive) "naive" subset and the CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) "memory" subset. In light of this recent functional reinterpretation of T-lymphocyte subpopulations, we reinvestigated the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in liver biopsy specimens from patients with acute and chronic hepatitis. In normal liver, the few scattered mononuclear cells present in portal tracts and in the intralobular parenchyma consisted of both CD45RA-positive (2H4-positive) naive and CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells. In inflammatory liver diseases, portal tract and periportal and intralobular areas of inflammation consisted virtually only of CD45RO-positive (UCHL1-positive) memory T cells, which strongly expressed the CDw29 (4B4) antigen, and the adhesion molecules LFA-1, CD2, LFA-3, CD44 and VLA-4 and the activation marker human leukocyte antigen-DR. These results indicate that activated memory T cells represent the predominant subpopulation of lymphocytes in areas of liver inflammation. Memory T cells strongly express various homing receptors and adhesion molecules, which probably allow them to accumulate at inflammatory sites and to strengthen interaction with target cells. Furthermore, the increased number of memory T cells with enhanced interferon-gamma production in areas of liver inflammation may contribute to the maintenance and up-regulation of immune responses occurring in inflammatory liver diseases. 
Intrauterine applications of the resectoscope. The resectoscope, used for decades in the surgical treatment of the bladder, has important applications for gynecologic procedures as well. The surgeon may either resect intrauterine disease or ablate the endometrium with the use of the resectoscope. Both of these outpatient procedures offer women significant reduction in risk and cost compared with extensive surgical procedures that they replace. The resectoscope delivers surgical energy of equal effect to the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser at a fraction of the cost. Gynecologists who wish to learn this new technique must be familiar with hysteroscopy as well as fluid imbalance problems. 
Leu-22 (L60). A more sensitive marker than UCHL1 for peripheral T-cell lymphomas, particularly large-cell types. Paraffin-embedded sections of 77 peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCLs) were stained with several monoclonal antibodies, including the preferential T-cell markers Leu-22 (L60[CD43]) and UCHL1 (CD45RO). The staining characteristics of L60 and UCHL1 were compared to determine the value of each in the immunophenotypic analysis of PTCLs. Lineage specificity was evaluated among 39 B-cell lymphomas and 33 cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD). L60 and/or UCHL1 stained 95% of PTCLs, whereas L60 and UCHL1 alone stained 90% and 69% of cases, respectively. L60 demonstrated significantly greater numbers of immunopositive tumor cells than UCHL1 in 37% of the PTCL cases, principally because of enhanced marking of large, neoplastic cells. UCHL1 was a better marker in only 10% of the PTCL cases. L60 stained 33% of B-cell lymphomas, usually small lymphocytic or lymphoplasmacytic types. UCHL1 stained only 8% of B-cell lymphomas, all large-cell types. L60 and UCHL1 stained Reed-Sternberg cells and variants in three cases of nodular sclerosing HD. These results suggest that both L60 and UCHL1 are useful markers of PTCLs in routinely processed tissue. L60 is a more sensitive marker of large neoplastic T-cells than UCHL1 but is less lineage-specific. These antibodies are most effective when used as part of a panel of monoclonal antibodies. 
Herniated cervical disk presenting as ischemic chest pain. Myocardial ischemia must be the first concern of every emergency physician in evaluating chest pain in the adult patient. Any suspicion of myocardial ischemia must be promptly evaluated and admitted. The American College of Emergency Physicians has recently published a standards document on the care of chest pain in the adult patient. The emergency physician must be familiar with this document. Once myocardial ischemia and other life-threatening causes are ruled out, one can consider that cervical disk disease may be the cause of chest pain. The authors present two cases of patients who presented to the Emergency Department with signs and symptoms consistent with cardiac ischemia. Both patients were found to have herniated cervical disks. Subsequent surgical repair completely relieved their symptoms. Evaluation of the literature reveals that this entity was well described from 1950 to the 1960s. Most recent discussions do not mention disk herniation as even an infrequent cause of chest pain. If there is no life-threatening disease present, one should consider cervical disk disease. 
Hemodynamic response with passive neck flexion in brain death. Twelve brain-dead patients admitted to the Department of Traumatology, Osaka University Hospital, from July 1988 to August 1989 were studied. A hemodynamic response elicited by passive neck flexion was observed in 10 of the 12 patients. After passive neck flexion, blood pressure began to rise, and the heart rate increased slightly. Blood pressure peaked about 2 minutes after the initiation of neck flexion and then decreased gradually to the baseline level within a few minutes. These responses were suppressed completely by administration of the ganglion blocker trimethaphan camsilate, which suggests that the efferent pathway of the response is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system. 
Tissue characterization of an unusual right atrial mass by magnetic resonance imaging. In a 70-year-old man who had angina, exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia, and presyncopal symptoms, transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography disclosed a large atrial mass that resembled a myxoma. Subsequent evaluation by magnetic resonance imaging identified the mass as an intracardiac lipoma attached to the posterior wall of the right atrium, a diagnosis that was confirmed by surgical intervention. Thus, the diagnostic utility of magnetic resonance imaging as an adjunct to echocardiographic evaluation of intracardiac masses was demonstrated. 
Posttraumatic intradiploic leptomeningeal cyst in an adult: case report. We report the case of an adult with a posttraumatic intradiploic leptomeningeal cyst that caused a circumscribed osteolytic skull lesion. Local pain, the only symptom of the lesion, regressed after surgery. Intradiploic leptomeningeal cysts must be distinguished from intradiploic arachnoid cysts, which are of congenital origin. 
Evidence for a new tumor-suppressor gene involved in gastrointestinal malignancies. Inactivation or loss of tumor-suppressor genes is believed to lead to the development or progression of malignancies. To determine whether a tumor-suppressor gene is located on chromosome 8, DNA was extracted from tumor and normal tissue of colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic specimens, and allele loss was investigated by Southern hybridization techniques with the chromosome 8 probe D8S7. Twenty-five percent of pancreatic carcinomas, 50% of gastric carcinomas, and 50% of colorectal carcinomas were found to have lost an allele on chromosome 8. These findings suggest the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene on chromosome 8, which is involved in colorectal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. Definition of the frequency with which this tumor-suppressor gene is involved in gastrointestinal malignancies will await the study of many patients who are classified as informative and the use of multiple probes for chromosome 8. 
Physical activity and risk of developing colorectal cancer among college alumni. The assessment of physical activity at a single time to evaluate its association with cancer may be limited, since such a measure may not adequately reflect activity over the long term. To overcome this limitation, we studied 17,148 Harvard alumni aged 30-79 years who were followed prospectively for the occurrence of colon cancer (n = 225) and rectal cancer (n = 44) from 1965 through 1988. Physical activity, based on self-reported stair climbing, walking, and sports play, was assessed in either 1962 or 1966 (1962/1966) and again in 1977. The increased activity evaluated using either assessment (1962/1966 or 1977) taken alone was not associated with risk of colon cancer. However, alumni who were highly active (energy expenditure of greater than 2500 kilocalories/wk) at both assessments had half the risk of developing colon cancer relative to those who were inactive (less than 1000 kilocalories/wk) at both assessments (age-adjusted rate ratio = 0.50; 90% confidence interval = 0.27-0.93), whereas those who were moderately active (1000-2500 kilocalories/wk) at both assessments had an age-adjusted rate ratio of 0.52 (90% confidence interval = 0.28-0.94). We conclude that either consistently higher levels of activity are necessary to protect against colon cancer or combining two assessments increased the precision of physical activity measurement. We found no evidence that increased physical activity protected against rectal cancer. 
Clinical diagnosis for metastatic adenocarcinoma of spine of unknown origin. A comparative study. The diagnostic values of the presence of Virchow's node (VN) or rectal shelf (RS) in spinal metastasis from adenocarcinoma of unknown origin were studied prospectively in 60 patients during 1986-1988. These were compared with 14 cases with other malignancies of the spine and 37 controls with nonneoplastic spinal lesions. The diagnosis was confirmed by histologic study in all malignant cases. The results were analyzed by diagnostic test analysis and McNemar chi 2 testing. This yields 18.3-21.6%, 97.2-100%, and 92.8-100% sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value, respectively, for a positive test for VN and RS to differentiate significantly adenocarcinoma from other malignancies and control patients (P less than 0.005). These findings may thus be considered as a simple and economic guide for physicians to determine the proper approach to patients with a spinal lesion suspected to be malignant. 
Combined effect of neonatal sympathectomy and adrenal demedullation on blood pressure and vascular changes in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Neonatal sympathectomy using a combined treatment with antiserum to nerve growth factor and guanethidine during the first 4 weeks after birth was carried out in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Bilateral adrenal demedullation was performed in 4-week-old sympathectomized SHR and WKY rats. The development of hypertension in SHR was prevented by sympathectomy, but the blood pressure (BP) was still higher than in age-matched WKY rats. Demedullation reduced the BP of sympathectomized SHR to the same level as that of WKY rats. Heart rates of SHR and WKY rats were not affected by the treatments. Morphometric measurements of the mesenteric arteries showed that sympathectomy significantly reduced the medial mass in the mesenteric arteries of SHR, mainly through a reduction in the number of smooth muscle cell layers. In sympathectomized SHR, demedullation increased the lumen size of muscular arteries under maximally relaxed conditions, which might explain the further reduction in BP in these animals. Demedullation in sympathectomized SHR and WKY rats caused a decrease in smooth muscle cell layers in the superior mesenteric artery, but the same treatment resulted in a slight increase in the number of smooth muscle cell layers in the large and small mesenteric arteries of SHR and WKY rats. Adventitial area was increased in some mesenteric arteries of SHR and WKY rats by sympathectomy, and demedullation caused a further increase in the size of adventitia in WKY rats. Heart weight in SHR was normalized to the level found in WKY rats by sympathectomy and demedullation. We conclude that in sympathectomized SHR, the elevated BP was maintained by the adrenal medulla. 
Virological investigations of acute encephalopathy in India A total of 740 consecutive children aged between 6 months and 12 years who presented with acute encephalopathic illnesses during a three year period were assessed both clinically and by laboratory investigations. Cerebrospinal fluid was examined for the presence of cells or other abnormal substances, and any organisms were cultured. Blood examination included white cell count and estimations of haemoglobin, urea, glucose, and electrolyte concentrations and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. A firm diagnosis was established in 278 patients (38%). Pyogenic meningitis (n = 134), measles encephalopathy (n = 38), and electrolyte imbalance (n = 23) were important causes in this group, cerebral malaria (n = 4) was uncommon and there were no cases of Reye's syndrome. The diagnoses of the remaining 462 were combined under the heading 'acute unexplained encephalopathy'. Altogether 394 of the 462 patients underwent virological investigations for arboviruses and 92 (23%) had one or more indicators of Japanese encephalitis. No other arboviruses could be isolated. Throat swabs from 187 patients with acute unexplained encephalopathy were studied on monkey kidney tissue cell lines of which 14 were positive (8%). These were identified as adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, poliomyelitis, Coxsackie, and echovirus; in two cases the virus was untypable. Japanese encephalitis is an important cause of acute childhood encephalopathy in this region. Clinical features of the illness may be mimicked by several disorders which require specific treatment. Thirty four of the 92 died (37%). 
Endoscopic injection sclerotherapy versus conservative treatment for patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and bleeding esophageal varices. We performed endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) in the treatment of 37 patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The results were compared with those in another 33 HCC patients treated only conservatively, without EIS, during the same period. A majority of both groups died within 3 weeks after treatment. Comparing the two groups, there was no significant difference in fatal bleeding (66% vs 75%), but significantly fewer of the EIS patients died of the index hemorrhage (43% vs. 83%; p less than 0.01). Also, in the absence of portal vein thrombosis, EIS significantly reduced the risk of fatal bleeding (31% vs. 73%; p less than 0.25). The mean days of survival were 32 +/- 15 (range, 2 to 320) in the EIS group and 10 +/- 14 (range, 2 to 270) in the compared group (p less than 0.001). We conclude that EIS provides temporary control of acute esophageal variceal bleeding in patients with unresectable HCC. The major factors contributing to EIS failure are the lethal propensity of the underlying disease and portal vein thrombosis. 
An immunochemical and immunohistochemical study of aldolase isozymes in renal cell carcinoma. To assess changes in aldolase isozyme patterns (A, B, and C) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tissues and to evaluate whether serum aldolase A might be a useful marker for RCC, quantitative analysis by enzyme immunoassay and immunohistochemical localization were performed. Concentrations of aldolase A in RCC (7300 +/- 6300 ng./mg. protein n = 26) were significantly higher than those of normal cortex (720 +/- 410 ng./mg. protein, n = 14, p less than 0.01); concentrations of aldolase C in RCC (48.0 +/- 8.0 ng./mg. protein) were also significantly higher than those of normal cortex (8.7 +/- 4.7 ng./mg. protein, p less than 0.01). On the other hand, concentrations of aldolase B in normal cortex were 18,100 +/- 10,100 ng./mg. protein (n = 14), whereas the values in RCC were only 130 +/- 270 ng./mg. protein, a significant lowering (p less than 0.01). Immunohistochemically, aldolases A and C were found localized in all RCC tissues (n = 10); aldolase B was faintly stained in only a few tumor cells of two cases (20%). Levels of serum aldolase A were elevated (greater than 300 ng./ml.) in 30 (75%) of 40 patients with RCC as compared to three (6.3%) of 48 individuals with urogenital benign diseases and in seven (21%) of 34 cases with non-RCC urogenital malignancies. Since it is generally accepted that RCC are derived from renal proximal tubules, these findings indicate that aldolase B, the predominant isozyme in the normal case, changes into aldolases A and C during carcinogenesis and that serum aldolase A could be a new useful biomarker for RCC. 
Uhthoff's symptom in optic neuritis: relationship to magnetic resonance imaging and development of multiple sclerosis. Eighty-one patients with a first attack of isolated optic neuritis, 40 with Uhthoff's symptom (Group 1) and 41 without (Group 2), were studied. All had a neurovisual examination, 74 of 81 patients had the pattern visual evoked potential recorded at rest, and 43 had magnetic resonance imaging brain scans. The pattern visual evoked potential P100 latency was prolonged, Group 1 with a mean of 136 +/- 19 msec. Group 2 with a mean of 131 +/- 19 msec (control subjects, 102 +/- 5 msec; n = 84), and the P100 amplitude was reduced, without significant difference between the groups. Abnormal magnetic resonance imaging scans were present in significantly more patients in Group 1 (p less than 0.025). Treatment of optic neuritis with corticosteroids had no effect on the evolution or duration of Uhthoff's symptom. Overall, 35 of 81 (43%) patients, followed for a mean of 3.5 years, developed multiple sclerosis. The incidence was significantly greater in Group 1 (p less than 0.01). Uhthoff's symptom also correlated with a higher incidence of recurrent optic neuritis. We conclude that Uhthoff's symptom is a prognostic indicator for the early development of multiple sclerosis. 
An ectopic pregnancy in the upper retroperitoneum following in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. Thirty-seven days after successful embryo transfer, a chorionic vesicle was recovered from the upper abdominal retroperitoneal space in a patient presenting with an acute life-threatening hemorrhage. This is the first case report of a retroperitoneal ectopic pregnancy which, although uncommon, is a potentially fatal complication of in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer. 
Insulin and glucagon levels in fulminant hepatic failure in man. The behavior of insulin and glucagon and related metabolic substrates was assayed in plasma of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. All 12 subjects were provided the same nutritional support. High levels of insulin and glucagon were present at all times and no difference was observed between surviving patients (four) and those who died (8). Elevated values for branched-chain and aromatic amino acids as well as alanine were present. Statistically significant lower levels of aromatic amino acids and consequently a greater branched chain-aromatic amino acid ratio was found in surviving vs nonsurviving patients. A significantly greater level of alpha-fetoprotein was found in patients who survived as compared to those who died. 
Spinal cord stimulation for chronic, intractable pain: superiority of "multi-channel" devices. Spinal cord stimulation has evolved over the past 20 years into an easily implemented technique, with low morbidity, for the treatment of intractable, chronic pain in properly selected patients. We report our experience with a series of 62 patients implanted between 1983 and 1987, with percutaneous and laminectomy electrodes, and with single- and "multi-channel" (programmable, multi-contact) devices. Fifty had chronic, intractable low back and leg pain ("failed back surgery syndrome," lumbar arachnoid fibrosis), five had spinal cord injuries, and seven "peripheral" pathology or stump pain. Statistical analysis of these and other patient characteristics and technical factors was undertaken to identify predictors of outcome. All patients were interviewed by a disinterested third party at a mean of 2.14 years following implantation. A majority of patients reported at least 50% sustained relief of pain and indicated that they would go through the procedure again for the same result. There was corresponding improvement in ability to perform various everyday activities, and decrease in use of analgesics. Ten of 40 failed back patients who were disabled before the procedure returned to work postoperatively. Superposition of stimulation paresthesias upon a patient's topography of pain was found to be a statistically significant predictor of successful relief of pain, by linear regression methods. Univariate and multivariate analysis of patient characteristics and technical factors as predictors of outcome demonstrated significant advantages for female patients, and for patients implanted with "multi-channel" devices. With these devices, electrode geometries with central cathode(s) flanked by rostral and caudal anode(s) were favored disproportionately. Technical improvements in implanted spinal cord stimulation devices, in particular the development of multi-contact percutaneous electrode arrays and supporting programmable electronics, have significantly improved clinical results. 
Primary repair of colon injuries in a developing country. Because there are several specific disadvantages to a colostomy in a developing country, primary repair for colon injury was electively performed. Sixty-one consecutive patients with colon injury were seen between 1978 and 1989 and 57 of these (93 per cent) underwent primary repair. In four a colostomy was constructed. Emergency repair was carried out regardless of site or mode of injury, presence of hypotension or peritoneal contamination. There was one death unrelated to anastomotic complications and one anastomotic leakage. The faecal fistula closed spontaneously in 4 weeks. The wound infection rate was 10 per cent. These data support the emerging view that primary repair of colon injury is the management of choice. 
Reducing postischemic paraplegia using conjugated superoxide dismutase. Paraplegia after thoracic aortic aneurysm repair has an incidence of 2.2% to 24%. Oxygen-derived free radicals after reperfusion of an ischemic spinal cord may be partly responsible for neuronal destruction. We studied the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), a free radical scavenger, as a way of increasing spinal cord tolerance to ischemia. Thirty rabbits underwent 40 minutes of aortic occlusion (a known model of paraplegia). Ten of these animals received 25,000 U/kg of PEG-SOD 24 hours before aortic occlusion and two additional doses of 10,000 U/kg, one before and one subsequent to spinal ischemia. Ten animals received superoxide dismutase in the same dosages as those receiving PEG-SOD. Ten control animals received placebo. All animals were studied for 96 hours, at which time a final neurological examination was performed and the results were recorded. Of the 10 animals treated with PEG-SOD, 2 were completely paralyzed whereas 8 had less (7) or no (1) neurological impairment. Eight of the 10 control animals and 9 of the 10 animals receiving superoxide dismutase were completely paralyzed. None of the control animals or animals receiving superoxide dismutase had a normal neurological examination (p less than or equal to 0.05). Treatment with PEG-SOD before and during occlusion increased the rabbit spinal cord tolerance to a 40-minute ischemic insult. Scavenging free radicals may lessen experimental spinal cord injury. 
Estramustine binding protein in human brain-tumor tissue. Estramustine, an estradiol-17 beta and nornitrogen mustard complex, is used in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma. A specific estramustine binding protein (EMBP) is important for its cytotoxic action, and the presence of EMBP has previously been demonstrated in rat and human prostatic cancer tissue. Significant levels of EMBP were detected by radioimmunoassay in human brain-tumor tissue. The EMBP concentrations (expressed as ng/mg protein) in 16 astrocytomas (mean 2.6 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 6.2 ng/mg) and seven meningiomas (mean 5.1 ng/mg, range 0.3 to 9.3 ng/mg) were significantly higher than that found in four samples of epileptic brain (mean 0.7 ng/mg, range 0.5 to 1 ng/mg) and 18 samples of normal brain (mean 0.5 ng/mg, range 0.2 to 1.0 ng/mg). The uptake, metabolism, and antiproliferative effects of the prostatic anticancer agent estramustine have been previously demonstrated in cultured glioma cells. The presence of EMBP may suggest a selective binding and effectiveness in human brain-tumor tissue. 
The disappearance of the "cold patch" in recovered migraine patients: thermographic findings. In a previous paper we suggested that the vascular cold patch may be a useful prognostic index to followup migraine patients. Considerable criticism against our contention has been raised by Swerdlow and Dieter (Headache 29:562-568, 1989, ref. 1), who claim that the cold patch constitutes a "fixed geography" of the vasculature of migraine patients. In the present paper we replicate and extend our previous findings reporting the results of facial thermography in a sample of 246 consecutive migraine patients. Of these the 206 exhibiting a typical cold patch or a significant asymmetry in the forehead thermal dissipation were admitted to prophylactic treatment (beta blocker or calcium channel blocker). The thermography was performed at entry in the study and after six months of active treatment. The clinical outcome was compared to the thermographic findings. The patients were subdivided in three classes on the basis of the clinical outcome. Among the 136 patients who experienced complete or substantial relief from headache the cold patch disappeared or markedly improved in 85% of the cases. In the 46 patients with partial relief the thermogram showed an improved pattern in 48% of cases, most of the time of smaller extent than in the previous class. In 24 patients we observed no clinical improvement. Among these the thermogram remained unchanged in 85% of cases. Taken together these findings corroborate our previous suggestion that thermography is useful to monitor the clinical course of the disease. One additional suggestion from the present data is that thermography closely parallels the clinical course so as to represent a useful criterion for the decision of discontinuing the therapy. 
Biochemical and molecular analysis of cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in Leigh's syndrome. We studied three patients with Leigh's syndrome (LS) and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. Biochemical studies in brain, muscle, heart, liver, kidney, and fibroblasts disclosed a generalized COX deficiency. Kinetic studies of COX activity in brain mitochondria showed a low Vmax and a normal Km for reduced cytochrome c. Immunologic studies showed decrease of all COX subunits studied, without a specific defect of any one of them. Southern blot analysis excluded large deletions of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) but revealed a generalized increase in mtDNA quantity. Although Northern blot analysis showed no alteration in the 12 COX subunit mRNAs studied, two of three patients showed a decreased steady state rate of COX transcription in brain. COX deficiency in LS thus appears to be related to a decreased amount of otherwise normal COX holoenzyme. 
Balloon dilatation of restrictive interatrial communications in congenital heart disease. An adequate interatrial communication is necessary for survival in several forms of congenital heart disease. Three children are presented in whom blade atrial septostomy proved either technically impossible or failed to achieve adequate interatrial communication. In all three an adequate communication was obtained by a balloon dilatation technique similar to that used for pulmonary valve dilatation. In one critically ill infant with mitral atresia the procedure was life saving. 
Effect of enlarged adenoids on arterial blood gases in children. The enlarged adenoid is a common disorder in children resulting in nasopharyngeal obstruction. Many authors suggest that increased nasal resistance to respiration may cause disturbances in the pulmonary ventilation and carry the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea and/or cardiopulmonary syndrome. This study comprised 30 children complaining of long-standing nasal obstruction due to enlarged adenoids. Adenoidectomy was performed and the arterial blood gases were measured before and one month after surgery. Twelve normal children were also included as controls. Statistical evaluation of the results showed that O2 saturation and arterial O2 tension (PaO2) were significantly low before the operation, and increased significantly after surgery. Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) was insignificantly low before operation, but decreased significantly after adenoidectomy. It was concluded that enlarged adenoid may be associated with ventilatory impairment which is reversible after adenoidectomy. 
Ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of home parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. A case report. Severe cholestasis associated with long-term home parenteral nutrition is rare, and no treatment is known to be effective. This study shows a case of a patient who developed jaundice while receiving long-term home parenteral nutrition. Causes of jaundice, other than the patient's parenteral feedings, were excluded. The patient's jaundice did not respond to alterations in his parenteral feeding program or to metronidazole. Ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg/day) led to a prompt and sustained improvement in his hyperbilirubinemia. When ursodeoxycholic acid was stopped, the patient again became jaundiced, but this resolved with reinstitution of ursodeoxycholic acid. This case suggests that ursodeoxycholic acid may be an effective treatment for home parenteral nutrition--associated cholestasis and should be evaluated further in patients with cholestasis associated with parenteral feeding. 
Gastric collision tumor (carcinoid and adenocarcinoma) with gastritis cystica profunda. We report a rare case of gastric collision tumor (carcinoid and adenocarcinoma) with gastritis cystica profunda that developed in a 49-year-old Japanese man. Early gastric cancer (moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma) was present at the edge of an ulcer in the posterior wall of the upper gastric body. In addition, a carcinoid tumor was found adjacent to adenocarcinoma. This tumor displayed ribbonlike or trabecular patterns, and numerous constituent cells were positive for the argyrophil reaction with Grimelius' stain and serotonin. Electron microscopic features of this tumor confirmed typical carcinoid. There was no merged appearance between both tumors, suggesting collision-type tumor. 
Value of planar 201Tl imaging in risk stratification of patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction. Although exercise ECG testing has been shown to have important prognostic value after acute myocardial infarction, exercise 201Tl scintigraphy offers several potential advantages, including: 1) increased sensitivity for detecting residual myocardial ischemia; 2) the ability to localize ischemia to a specific area or areas subtended by a specific coronary artery; 3) the ability to identify exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction, which is manifested by increased lung uptake or transient left ventricular dilation; and 4) more reliable risk stratification of individual patients. The more optimal prognostic efficiency of 201Tl scintigraphy partially results from the fact that the error rate in falsely classifying patients as low risk is significantly smaller with 201Tl scintigraphy than with stress ECG. Because of these substantial advantages, there seems to be adequate rationale for recommending exercise perfusion imaging rather than exercise ECG alone as the preferred method for evaluating mortality and morbidity risks after acute myocardial infarction. 
A prospective evaluation of myocardial contusion: correlation of significant arrhythmias and cardiac output with CPK-MB measurements. Over a nine-month period, patients with chest trauma were prospectively evaluated for myocardial contusion. Ninety-two patients with evidence of anterior chest trauma were entered into the study and had 1) an ECG on admission and daily for three days; 2) monitoring of the myocardial band fraction of creatine phosphokinase (CPK-MB) on admission and every eight hours for 24 hours; 3) continuous electrocardiographic Holter monitoring for three to five days; and 4) noninvasive pulsed-Doppler cardiac output measurements daily for three days. Twenty-three patients developed 25 significant arrhythmias (SARRs): 1 atrial fibrillation, 1 AV dissociation, 5 supraventricular tachycardias, and 18 paroxysmal ventricular tachycardias. Cardiac outputs were significantly higher in those patients without SARRs. The CPK-MB levels correlated with the SARRs but were neither sensitive nor specific. No patients required specific therapy and none developed adverse sequelae of the SARRs. We conclude that 1) CPK-MB monitoring should not be routinely used for screening and diagnosis; 2) continuous arrhythmia monitoring deserves further clinical investigation but not routine application; 3) stable patients at risk for myocardial contusion should be monitored for 24 hours; and 4) the Abbreviated Injury Score for "minor" myocardial contusion should be deleted for purposes of ISS tabulation. 
Clipping of an aneurysm 20 years after encasement with methyl methacrylate. Case report. A variety of agents have been used to coat aneurysms as an alternative to clipping. These agents were employed more frequently prior to the routine use of the operating microscope and the presently available variety of aneurysm clips. One such coating agent is methyl methacrylate. This report describes a patient with an anterior communicating aneurysm that rebled 20 years after being encased in methyl methacrylate. At operation, the pulsating aneurysm had eroded the adjacent layer of methyl methacrylate, creating a small intervening space. This space allowed removal under the microscope (with a high-speed air drill and a diamond bit) of the methyl methacrylate from the anterior cerebral arteries and aneurysm, exposing it for definitive clip placement. The feasibility of clipping encased aneurysms is discussed. 
A tRNA(Lys) mutation in the mtDNA is the causal genetic lesion underlying myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber (MERRF) syndrome. Skeletal muscle mtDNA of three patients with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, characterized clinically by myoclonic epilepsy and ragged-red fiber (MERRF) syndrome, has been sequenced to determine the underlying molecular defect(s). An A-to-G substitution of nt 8344 in the tRNA(Lys) gene, a substitution suggested to be associated with MERRF encephalomyopathy, was detected in these patients. Abnormal patterns of mitochondrial translation products were observed in the skeletal muscle of patients, consistent with the expected consequential defect in protein synthesis. The genealogical studies of the three patients, as well as mtDNA from one published MERRF patient and from nine other normal and disease controls, revealed that the tRNA(Lys) mutations in the MERRF patients have arisen independently. These observations provided evidence that the base substitution is a causal mutation for MERRF. 
Screening for dementia and investigating its causes. OBJECTIVE: To examine, from the perspective of primary care physicians, the value of mental status findings and ancillary tests in diagnosing dementia or its causes. DATA SOURCES: Studies identified using MEDLINE and bibliographies of pertinent articles. STUDY SELECTION: Selection based on availability of information on specific findings or tests, the criterion standard used to confirm diagnoses, the disease spectrum, and the richness of the reported data. DATA EXTRACTION: Data collected on sensitivity and specificity. In many cases, the originally reported data are re-analyzed to illustrate the usefulness of alternative cut-off values or to answer specific clinical questions. Likelihood ratios estimated to summarize test results. DATA SYNTHESIS: Probability of dementia is greatly reduced (likelihood ratio, 0.06 to 0.2) when either normal serial 7s, 7-digit span, 3-item recall, or clock drawing test results are obtained; abnormal results only moderately increase the odds of disease. Low (less than or equal to 20), intermediate (21 to 25), or high (greater than or equal to 26) scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) increase (likelihood ratio greater than or equal to 8.2), have little effect (likelihood ratio, 1.3 to 2.4), or decrease (likelihood ratio, 0.06 to 0.1) the odds of disease. The usefulness of tests to investigate the cause of dementia varies depending on the pretest probability of the specific condition. CONCLUSIONS: Several useful methods exist to screen for cognitive impairment, and clinicians need to be familiar with the strengths and limitations of their preferred screening methods. In investigating the cause of dementia, routinely obtaining a VDRL test, cerebral imaging studies, serum cobalamin level, or folate level is unwarranted. 
Fluticasone propionate in Crohn's disease. Fluticasone propionate, a topically active corticosteroid of low systemic bioavailability after oral administration, has been used in a pilot study for the treatment of mild and moderately active Crohn's disease. Twelve patients received oral fluticasone propionate for three weeks, and the effects were monitored using the Crohn's disease activity index and by 111In granulocyte scanning, assessing inflammation from scan appearances, four day faecal excretion of radioactivity, and whole body excretion of radioactivity. All patients completed the trial. No serious side effects were reported. There was a significant fall in Crohn's disease activity index values over the three week treatment period (193 (84) v 122 (51), p less than 0.01). 111In leucocyte scan images were improved (seven patients) or unchanged (five patients). There was a significant fall in excretion of injected radioactivity calculated from whole body data (28 (21)% v 14 (0.7)%, p less than 0.05). There were no changes in plasma cortisol values, either basal or synacthen stimulated. Fluticasone propionate is a promising therapeutic agent for Crohn's disease that offers the possibility of controlling inflammation without inducing systemic corticosteroid side effects and which merits evaluation in a double blind trial versus conventional corticosteroids. 
Intravenous phentolamine test: diagnostic and prognostic use in reflex sympathetic dystrophy. In some patients, ongoing and evoked neurogenic pain is relieved by pharmacological or destructive block of the sympathetic innervation of the affected part. In others, sympatholysis is ineffective. The present report shows that these two groups of patients can be distinguished by a safe and simple diagnostic test. Individuals in whom the pain was transiently relieved by intravenous phentolamine (Regitine) were very likely to respond favourably to subsequent sympatholytic treatment with i.v. regional guanethidine. Individuals in whom the phentolamine test was negative did not enjoy pain relief from this type of sympatholysis. 
The moving, projected, annual total. A kinetic prognostic entity. A simple, inexpensive method of prognostically calculating and graphically recording annual case loads of the various deaths investigated by today's medicolegal offices is presented. Graphic depiction of the numerical data provides a convenient way to compare current prognostications with the records of preceding years. 
Study of brain electrolytes and organic osmolytes during correction of chronic hyponatremia. Implications for the pathogenesis of central pontine myelinolysis. Osmotic injury induced by rapid correction of severe chronic hyponatremia has been implicated in the development of central pontine myelinolysis. Organic osmolytes known previously as "idiogenic osmoles" accumulate intracellularly to protect cells from osmotic injury. We investigated the changes of these organic osmolytes as well as electrolytes in the brain during the induction and correction of chronic hyponatremia. Using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and HPLC, we found that in rats with chronic hyponatremia (3 d, serum sodium = 109 +/- 3 meq/liter), brain concentrations of myoinositol (41%), glycerophosphorylcholine (45%), phosphocreatine/creatine (60%), glutamate (53%), glutamine (45%), and taurine (37%) were all significantly decreased compared with control values (percentage control value shown, all P less than 0.01). The contribution of measured organic osmolytes and electrolytes to the total brain osmolality change was 23 and 72%, respectively. With rapid correction by 5% NaCl infusion, significant brain dehydration and elevation of brain Na and Cl levels above the normal range occurred at 24 h. These changes were not seen with slow correction by water deprivation. Reaccumulation of most organic osmolytes except glycerophosphorylcholine is delayed during the correction of hyponatremia and is independent of the correction rate of serum sodium. It is concluded that: most of the change of brain osmolality in chronic hyponatremia can be accounted by the changes in organic osmolytes and brain electrolytes; and rapid correction of hyponatremia is associated with an overshoot of brain sodium and chloride levels along with a low organic osmolyte level. The high cerebral ion concentrations in the absence of adequate concentrations of organic osmolytes may be relevant to the development of central pontine myelinolysis. 
Interleukin-2-induced lung injury is mediated by oxygen free radicals. Interleukin-2 therapy leads to respiratory dysfunction caused by increased vascular permeability. This study examines the role of oxygen-derived free radicals (OFR). Sheep (n = 6) with chronic lung lymph fistulae were given interleukin-2, 10(5) units/kg, as an intravenous bolus. The mean pulmonary artery pressure rose from 13 to 23 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) at 1 hour and remained elevated for 4 hours, although the pulmonary artery wedge pressure was unchanged at 4 mm Hg. Arterial oxygen tension fell from 88 to 77 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). Lung lymph flow rose from 2.2 to 6.4 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05) at 3 hours. This rise coincided with an increase in the lymph/plasma protein ratio from 0.67 to 0.77 (p less than 0.05) and lymph protein clearance from 1.5 to 4.4 ml/30 min (p less than 0.05), indicating increased lung microvascular permeability. Interleukin-2 led to transient increases in plasma thromboxane B2 from 168 to 388 pg/ml (p less than 0.05) and lung lymph thromboxane B2 from 235 to 694 pg/ml (p less than 0.05). The leukocyte count fell from 8156 to 4375/mm3 (p less than 0.05) primarily caused by a 78% drop in lymphocyte count. Platelet count declined from 292 to 184 X 10(3)/mm3 (p less than 0.05). Pretreatment with the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea, 1 gm/kg, intravenously, (n = 6) prevented the interleukin-2-induced increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure, lung lymph flow, lymph/plasma protein ration, lymph protein clearance, and thromboxane B2 levels in plasma and lung lymph. The arterial oxygen tension decreased from 85 to 80 mm Hg (p less than 0.05). The leukocyte count declined from 7854 to 6229/mm3 (p less than 0.05), but this was not as low nor as prolonged as the interleukin-2 group. Further, the decrease in platelet count was prevented (p less than 0.05). Interleukin-2 incubated with sheep or human leukocytes led to a dose-dependent increase in intracellular hydrogen peroxide production by neutrophils as measured by flow cytometry of dichlorofluorescein oxidation. These data indicate that interleukin-2 stimulates OFR generation and that OFR moderate the interleukin-2-induced increased lung permeability. 
Alterations in circulating lymphocyte number and function after circulation through colorectal carcinomas. Thirty-six patients undergoing curative resection for colorectal cancer were studied to determine the effect of the tumor on lymphocytes circulating through it. In the venous blood draining the tumor, there was an increased percentage of natural killer (NK) cells (p = 0.001), no difference in overall NK cell function, and decreased T-lymphocyte activation (p = 0.035) and proliferation (p = 0.002) compared with the lymphocytes in the arterial blood supplying the tumor. There were no significant differences in the control group of 16 patients. Local effects of colorectal cancer may include the ability to down-regulate T and NK cell function while increasing the number of NK cells. Means of enhancing antitumor activity therapeutically in an adjuvant setting, possibly through the portal vein during surgery, need to be considered, especially in the light of the immunosuppressive effects of surgery. 
Conventional therapy for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in children. In children, the most frequent type of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome is the minimal-change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS). Its treatment is aimed at inducing remission, preventing relapses and avoiding side-effects. Minimal-change disease is responsive to immunosuppressive therapy. The conventional treatment consists of glucocorticosteroids and the most widely used derivative is prednisone. Initial treatment should be intensive, for example, prednisone for 12 weeks, in order to reduce the risk of subsequent relapse. Treatment of relapses should be standardized in order to categorize the patient's disease for further treatment. If a frequent relapser develops signs of steroid toxicity, alkylating drugs should be prescribed: cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil for eight weeks for frequent relapsers who are not steroid-dependent; cyclophosphamide for 12 weeks for those who are. In steroid-resistant cases, a renal biopsy is indicated and treatment should be administered according to histological changes. 
Intravenous adenosine in the emergency department management of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. STUDY PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of adenosine in the treatment of emergency department patients with spontaneous paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT). DESIGN: An eight-month prospective outcome study. POPULATION: Patients 16 or more years old with PSVT by surface ECG criteria. Patients were excluded if there was clinical or hemodynamic evidence of hypoperfusion. MEASUREMENTS: Patient age, sex, PSVT rate, pretreatment blood pressure, history of cardiac disease, chronic drug therapy, and response to IV adenosine. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with 27 episodes of suspected PSVT met inclusion criteria. After IV adenosine, two patients were found to have atrial flutter, and one was found to have ventricular tachycardia. Twenty-four episodes of PSVT were diagnosed in the remaining 21 patients. There were eight male and 13 female patients with a mean age of 51 +/- 19 years (range, 16 to 80 years). Sixteen patients related a history of cardiovascular disease. The mean QRS rate during PSVT was 181 +/- 23. Twenty-three of 24 episodes (96%) were converted to sinus rhythm within 20 to 45 seconds of adenosine therapy. However, 13 of 23 of initial conversions (57%) were followed by recurrence of PSVT within five minutes. All 13 recurrences required therapy with other antiarrhythmic drugs for conversion to and maintenance of sinus rhythm. Complications of adenosine were noted in only four patients and were transient and clinically unimportant. CONCLUSION: IV adenosine effectively terminates PSVT in ED patients with spontaneous PSVT; recurrence of PSVT after adenosine is common in the ED population and should be treated with other antiarrhythmic agents, not repeated doses of adenosine; adenosine is useful in the differential diagnosis of tachyarrhythmias; and doubling the initial dose of adenosine to 12 mg would increase the likelihood of conversion with the first dose. 
Atypical hyperplasia of the breast: mammographic appearance and histologic correlation. The mammograms and histologic slides of 58 cases of atypical hyperplasia (AH) of the breast were retrospectively reviewed to determine the geographic correlation (direct, near, or remote) between mammographic abnormalities (if present) and the histologic findings. A direct mammographic-histologic correlation was found in 24 of the 58 cases (41%), near correlation in 15 (26%), and remote correlation in 19 (33%). Clustered microcalcifications were the most common mammographic abnormality that was directly correlated with AH at histologic examination. Atypical ductal hyperplasia was much more frequently associated with a direct mammographic-histologic correlation than was atypical lobular hyperplasia (48% vs 9%). The authors conclude that, although no pathognomonic appearance of AH was discovered, mammographic abnormalities similar to those of small cancers could be directly correlated with histologic findings in 41% of cases. Since AH has been shown to be associated with a five- to tenfold increased risk of subsequent invasive carcinoma, frequent clinical and at least yearly mammographic follow-up is suggested once AH is discovered. 
Effect of taurine on total parenteral nutrition-associated cholestasis. A decrease in the formation/secretion of bile has been well documented in animals on total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Either an excess or an imbalance of amino acids (AA) has been most often implicated. In view of recent work showing that taurine promotes bile flow, bile acid secretion, and protects against hepatotoxic bile acids, the effect of adding taurine (15 mg/dL) to an AA solution was examined in guinea pigs on TPN for 3 days. The TPN-taurine group had a larger bile flow than the group without taurine and had bile acid secretory rates (BASR) similar to those of controls who were on saline by central catheter and had free access to food. Bile composition showed an increase in the secondary bile acid, 7-ketolithocholate and a concomitant decrease in chenodeoxycholate (CDC) in both experimental groups. Taurine led to a reversal of the usual predominance of glycine over taurine conjugated bile acids as well as to increases in HCO3 in cholesterol secretion. In response to a challenge with a large load of CDC, the TPN-taurine animals increased their BASR beyond those observed in the two other groups. These observations suggest that the addition of taurine to TPN solutions could play a role in the prevention of altered biliary function associated with AA solutions. 
Phase I study of liposomal MTP-PE-activated autologous monocytes administered intraperitoneally to patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. We have conducted a phase I study with autologous monocytes activated ex vivo and administered intraperitoneally in nine patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Blood monocytes were collected by leukapheresis and then purified by counterflow elutriation (up to 10(9) cells, with a purity of greater than 90%). Ex vivo activation was obtained by incubating these cells with 1 micrograms liposomal MTP-PE/10(6) monocytes for 18 hours in hydrophobic culture bags at 37 degrees C in 5% carbon dioxide humidified air. The activated monocytes were then infused in the peritoneal cavity once a week for 5 consecutive weeks through an implanted peritoneal infusion system, Port-A-Cath (Pharmacia Deltec, St Paul, MN), on an intrapatient dose-escalating schedule (10(7) to 10(9) monocytes). No severe adverse reactions occurred. Toxicity was mild, the chief acute reactions being fever (27%), chills (13%), and abdominal pain (25%). None of the side effects led to dose reduction. No consistent change in hemostatic function, liver function, or renal function was observed. Significant increases in granulocyte counts, neopterine, and acute phase reactants (fibrinogen, C-reactive protein) occurred in the peripheral blood. In vitro monocyte activation was demonstrated by the relapse of procoagulant activity and monokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF alpha]) in the supernatants of cultured monocytes. Evidence for in vivo monocyte activation was provided by the increase of these monokines in the peritoneal fluids. Kinetic studies with indium-111 (111In)-labeled activated autologous monocytes in five patients suggest that these infused monocytes may remain in the peritoneal cavity for up to 7 days. This locoregional immunotherapeutic approach seems to be encouraging in view of adjuvant therapeutic modality in ovarian cancer patients with minimal residual intraabdominal disease following second-look laparotomy. 
Prognosis of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma: an evaluation based on multivariate analysis of 90 cases. A multivariate analysis of data from 90 patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma was performed using Cox's regression model to identify factors possibly affecting their prognoses. Thirty-one patients underwent arterial anticancer chemotherapy, and the remaining 59 patients received transcatheter arterial embolization with anticancer agents. Four of 27 variables tested for all the patients (i.e., encapsulation [p less than 0.05], gross appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma [p less than 0.01], clinical stage [p less than 0.01] and therapy [p less than 0.01]) were found to be prognostically significant. Five of 27 variables tested were prognostically significant for the transcatheter arterial embolization group; they were an extension rate of hepatocellular carcinoma (p less than 0.01), encapsulation (p less than 0.01), alpha-fetoprotein (p less than 0.01), prothrombin time (p less than 0.01) and serum sodium (p less than 0.01). Regression equations were used to describe a prognostic index. A prognostic index was defined as the regression equation derived from the results of a total of 90 patients; PI-1 = eY, where PI-1 = prognostic index 1 Y = 1.549 (gross appearance of hepatocellular carcinoma - 1.344) + 0.778 (encapsulation - 1.622) + 0.818 (clinical stage - 1.800) + 1.760 (therapy - 1.344) and prognostic index 2, the regression equation derived from the results of the transcatheter arterial embolization group of patients; PI-2 = eY, where PI-2 = prognostic index 2 Y = 1.210 (extension rate of hepatocellular carcinoma - 1.576) + 1.179 (encapsulation - 1.475) + 0.0001277 (alpha-fetoprotein - 1420.792) -0.039 (prothrombin time - 72.237) - 0.214 (serum sodium - 138.427). 
alpha 1-antagonists in the treatment of hypertension. A number of agents are now available to treat hypertension. One relatively new class of agents is the selective alpha 1-inhibitors, which have distinct advantages over earlier nonselective alpha-adrenergic receptor-blocking agents. Three alpha 1-inhibitors are reviewed in this article: prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin. These alpha 1-inhibitors are similar in chemical structure and pharmacological action. alpha 1-Inhibitors lower blood pressure by reducing vascular tone in resistance and capacitance vessels. alpha 1-Inhibitors are similar in effectiveness in blood pressure lowering to other commonly used antihypertensive agents like the thiazide diuretic drugs and beta-blockers, which are efficacious as monotherapy in lowering pressure, as initial agents, or in combination with other antihypertensive agents in multidrug therapeutic regimens. alpha 1-Inhibitors are associated with a reasonably low incidence of serious adverse effects and are essentially free of any adverse metabolic effects. alpha 1-Inhibitors have been shown to beneficially effect blood lipids in several studies. The favorable lipid effect makes alpha 1-inhibitors especially appropriate to use in diabetic hypertensive and other patients with elevated serum lipid levels. The beneficial lipid effects may enhance the ability of alpha 1-inhibitors to prevent coronary heart disease, an outcome that has been difficult to demonstrate in thiazide-based trials. 
Glycolytic inhibition and calcium overload as consequences of exogenously generated free radicals in rabbit hearts. Free radicals have been implicated in the pathogenesis of reperfusion injury, but it is unclear how they exert their deleterious effects on cellular metabolism. Several lines of indirect evidence suggest that free radicals elevate intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and inhibit glycolysis as part of their mechanism of injury. We tested these ideas directly in hearts subjected to hydroxyl radicals produced by the Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectra were obtained from Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts before, during, and after 4 min of perfusion with H2O2 (0.75 mM) and Fe(3+)-chelate (0.1 mM). Isovolumic left ventricular pressure exhibited progressive functional deterioration and contracture after exposure to H2O2 + Fe3+. Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra revealed partial ATP depletion and sugar phosphate accumulation indicative of glycolytic inhibition. To measure [Ca2+]i, fluorine NMR spectra were acquired in a separate group of hearts loaded with the Ca2+ indicator 5F-BAPTA [5,5'-difluoro derivative of 1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane- N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid]. Mean time-averaged [Ca2+]i increased from 347 +/- 14 nM in control to 1,026 +/- 295 nM 4 min after free radical generation (means +/- SEM, n = 7), and remained elevated thereafter. We conclude that free radicals induce clear-cut, specific derangements of cellular metabolism in the form of glycolytic inhibition and calcium overload. The observed increase in [Ca2+]i suggests that the deleterious effects of free radicals are at least partially mediated by secondary changes in cellular calcium homeostasis. 
Successful removal of massive intragastric gallstones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy and mechanical lithotripsy. We describe a case of massive gallstones discharged into the stomach through a cholecystoduodenal fistula and the successful removal of these stones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EEHL) and endoscopic mechanical lithotripsy (EML) for the prevention of gallstone ileus. A 60-yr-old woman was admitted with epigastric pain and nausea. Upper gastrointestinal tract examination demonstrated backflow of contrast medium from the duodenal bulb into the gallbladder. Endoscopic examination revealed a large fistula on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, and two brown stones (about 3 cm in diameter) were found in the stomach. To prevent gallstone ileus, removal of these stones was attempted. They were broken into pieces by EEHL, then crushed into smaller pieces by EML and removed orally. Chemical analysis showed the composition of the gallstones to be at least 98% cholesterol. The patient was discharged one month after removal of the gallstones and has remained asymptomatic. 
Expression of specific UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms in carcinogen-induced preneoplastic rat liver nodules. The expression of specific UDP-glucuronosyltransferase isoforms in 2-acetylaminofluorane-induced rat liver preneoplastic nodules was studied; livers from pair-fed littermates were used as controls. For comparison, liver and kidney from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated or untreated (control) rats were used. Steady-state UDP-glucuronosyltransferase mRNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis or in situ hybridization of tissue sections using a 30-mer oligonucleotide specific for the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (which is active toward 4-nitrophenol) or a double-stranded cDNA probe specific for androsterone-UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. For 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, the mRNA level was very low in control liver; there was a 15-fold increase after 3-methylcholanthrene treatment. This mRNA was present at relatively high concentration in the kidney and there was a threefold increase after 3-methylcholanthrene administration. In livers with preneoplastic nodules 1 mo after cessation of carcinogen administration, this mRNA concentration was approximately 15 times greater than in control liver. Similar changes in the level of the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase were also observed by in situ hybridization of tissue sections. Immunocytochemical studies using an antiserum that recognizes the 3-methylcholanthrene-inducible UDP-glucuronosyltransferase showed a marked increase in the concentration of this isoform in preneoplastic nodules compared with the adjacent nonnodular liver. 
Deleted HTLV-I provirus in blood and cutaneous lesions of patients with mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides, a rare form of cutaneous T cell leukemia/lymphoma, is suspected of having a viral etiology on the basis of certain similarities to adult T cell leukemia, which is associated with human T cell leukemia/lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) infection. Cell lines were established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of an HTLV-I-seronegative patient with mycosis fungoides. DNA hybridization analysis revealed the presence of HTLV-I-related sequences with unusual restriction endonuclease sites. Sequence analysis of subcloned fragments demonstrated the presence of a monoclonally integrated provirus with a 5.5-kilobase deletion involving large regions of gag and env and all of pol. Additional evidence for the presence of deleted proviruses was found by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA from cutaneous lesions of five other HTLV-I-seronegative patients. The findings suggest that HTLV-I infection may be involved in the etiology of at least certain cases of mycosis fungoides. 
Bilateral internal mammary artery grafts in reoperative and primary coronary bypass surgery Bilateral internal mammary artery grafting is recognized as a preferred method of myocardial revascularization. However, its efficacy in coronary bypass reoperation has not been clearly established. From January 1982 through June 1989, 88 patients underwent coronary bypass reoperation with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts. Results were compared with those for a subset of 88 patients receiving primary revascularization with bilateral internal mammary artery grafts who were computer matched for sex, age, left ventricular function, anginal classification, and left main coronary artery disease. In each group, 62.5% (55 patients) had unstable angina, 43.2% (38 patients) had reduced ejection fraction, and 21.6% (19 patients) in the reoperation group and 20.5% (18 patients) in the reference group had left main coronary artery disease. Hospital mortality for the reoperation group was 6.8% (6 patients) and for the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients). No significant difference was found in the incidence of reoperation for bleeding, sternal infection, or stroke in the two groups. The incidence of respiratory insufficiency in the reoperation group was 13.6% (12 patients) and in the reference group, 3.4% (3 patients) (p less than 0.015). Recurrent angina occurred in 13.7% (10 patients) of patients in the reoperation group and 13.3% (10 patients) in the reference group. The long-term survival at 5 years for the reoperation group was 85.3% +/- 5.6% (+/- standard error of the mean) and for the reference group, 91.6% +/- 3.1%. No significant difference was found in the equality of survival distribution for the two groups. 
Developing anxiety-reduction procedures for a ventilator-dependent pediatric patient. This study evaluated two strategies to reduce anxiety behaviors which interfered with the daily tracheostomy care and ventilator maintenance of an eight-year-old ventilator-dependent boy. A multiple-baseline design (across ventilator and tracheostomy procedures) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of an information-only procedure and combined relaxation and cognitive distraction procedures. Partial-interval recording was used to measure heart rate, disruptive mouth noises, and demands and complaints to staff members. The patient's behavior did not change during a no-intervention baseline or during the information-only condition. Cognitive distraction and relaxation procedures were introduced, first during ventilator checks and then during tracheostomy care; corresponding decreases in heart rate, mouth noises, and demands and complaints were noted. Gains were maintained at one year follow-up. Results suggest that information alone may not effectively reduce anxiety behaviors for some ventilator-dependent patients unless additional anxiety-reduction procedures are implemented. 
Hemilaryngectomy for salvage of radiation therapy failures. Radiation therapy has been the treatment most frequently used for early vocal cord cancer with surgery usually in the form of total laryngectomy held in reserve as a salvage option. We report our experience in selected patients who, having failed radiation therapy for their early vocal cord cancers, underwent frontolateral hemilaryngectomy as attempted salvage surgery. Between 1977 and 1986, fourteen patients at the University of Pittsburgh Eye and Ear Hospital underwent hemilaryngectomy for salvage of their stage I vocal cord squamous cell carcinoma after full-course radiation therapy had been unsuccessful. Over this same time period, 77 patients underwent total laryngectomy for salvage of radiation therapy failure. Three patients failed hemilaryngectomy, two of whom were ultimately salvaged with total laryngectomy. Thus a 79% salvage rate was achieved with hemilaryngectomy with an average followup of 90 months. The overall cure rate was 93% (13 of 14) with voice preservation in 86% (12 of 14). Decannulation, postoperative infection, and initiation of oral intake were not influenced by age. Such problems occurred more often in patients undergoing radiation therapy compared to those undergoing hemilaryngectomy without previous radiation therapy. These results indicate that hemilaryngectomy may be used for the salvage of radiation therapy failures of stage I vocal cord carcinoma with good success and without undue morbidity. 
Comparative effects of oral molsidomine and nifedipine on methylergometrine-induced coronary artery spasm. Twelve consecutive patients (10 men and 2 women, mean +/- standard deviation age 49 +/- 9 years) with chest pain, angiographically normal coronary arteries and coronary artery spasm documented by methylergometrine testing received a single oral dose of molsidomine (4 mg) or nifedipine (10 mg) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover fashion at a 24-hour interval. Coronary artery spasm was documented during coronary angiography in 6 patients (left anterior descending artery, 3; right coronary artery, 2; left circumflex, 1). In the remaining 6 patients, coronary artery spasm was documented by a positive methylergometrine test performed at the bedside, which provoked ST-segment elevation in the inferior (n = 3), anterior (n = 1) or lateral (n = 2) leads. Ninety minutes after administration of the study medication, methylergometrine testing was performed at the bedside, using incremental doses of up to 0.4 mg of methylergometrine. After molsidomine, 10 patients (83%) had a negative and 2 had a positive test; after nifedipine, 9 patients (75%) had a negative and 3 a positive test. Only 1 patient had a methylergometrine test that remained positive after either molsidomine or nifedipine. Therefore, molsidomine appears as effective as nifedipine in suppressing methylergometrine-induced coronary artery spasm in patients with variant angina. In addition, patients not responding to 1 of the study medications may respond to the other. 
Characterisation of inflammatory cells associated with "idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis". During ureterolysis in a patient with "idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis", fresh samples of peri-ureteric and peri-aortic tissue were obtained. An abdominal CT scan confirmed the peri-aortic distribution of the inflammation associated with advanced abdominal aortic atherosclerosis. Histology confirmed the presence of fibrosis and a variable chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate. Monoclonal antibodies were used to identify the inflammatory cells. B and T lymphocytes were present with the majority of T lymphocytes of the T helper phenotype. The majority of lymphocytes and macrophages and most vascular endothelial cells were HLA-DR positive. Ki67 and BerH2 staining was found in B cells and T helper cells, indicating that these cells were proliferating and activated. These findings compare with the characterisation of inflammatory cells associated with "inflammatory aneurysms" and with the inflammatory cells present in the spectrum of inflammation seen as a complication of advanced atherosclerosis--conditions known as "chronic peri-aortitis". It is suggested that our findings support the view that idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis represents clinical chronic peri-aortitis seen in an undilated aorta. 
Aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in persons aged 80 years and over. Seventy-one patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years (mean +/- standard deviation 82 +/- 2) with aortic stenosis or mixed stenosis and regurgitation underwent aortic valve replacement alone (n = 35, group 1) or in combination with a coronary artery bypass procedure without any other valve procedure (n = 36, group 2). Preoperatively, 91% had severe cardiac limitations (New York Heart Association class III or IV). Hospital mortality was 12.7% overall (9 of 71), 5.7% (2 of 35) for group 1 and 19.4% (7 of 36) for group 2. Perioperatively, 1 patient (1.4%) had a stroke. Survival from late cardiac death at 1 and 3 years was 98.2 and 95.5%, respectively, for all patients, 100% for patients who underwent isolated aortic valve replacement, and 96.3 and 91.2%, respectively, for patients who underwent aortic valve replacement plus coronary artery bypass. Eighty-three percent of surviving patients had marked symptomatic improvement. Freedom from all valve-related complications (thromboembolism, anticoagulant, endocarditis, reoperation or prosthetic failure) was 93.3 and 80.4% at 1 and 3 years, respectively. Thus, short- and long-term morbidity and mortality after aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis in patients aged greater than or equal to 80 years are encouragingly low, although the addition of coronary artery bypass grafting increases short- and long-term mortality. 
Internal jugular vein thrombosis after ovulation induction with gonadotropins. An unusual case of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome complicated by internal jugular vein and mediastinal thrombosis is presented. Hemoconcentration and perhaps immobilization appear to be the most probable causative factors. The patient was successfully treated with heparin anticoagulation. An uneventful twin pregnancy resulted from the stimulation cycle. 
Nutritional support in liver failure. The most important manifestations of advanced liver disease are malnutrition, encephalopathy, and hepatorenal syndrome. Appropriate and optimal nutritional and metabolic support with specially formulated solutions enriched in branched-chain amino acids, together with other advanced treatments such as plasmapheresis, hemofiltration, and continuous arteriovenous hemodialysis, can correct the most important metabolic and clinical aberrations and temporarily improve the quality of life. However, the ultimately poor prognosis of patients with severe liver failure has not been altered significantly to date by the provision of nonspecific or specifically tailored nutrient regimens. The prognosis appears to depend on the arrest, correction, or reversal of the primary pathophysiologic process. 
Twelve cases of Ki-1 positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma of skin. In seven of 12 cases of Ber-H2 (Ki-1) positive anaplastic large cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (Ki-1 ALCL) disease remained localised to skin, and in five there was extracutaneous spread. Four patients had histological evidence of pre-existing or coexisting mycosis fungoides, and three patients had a long standing history of eczema or ichthyosis. In two cases the presence of a T phenotype was shown in frozen sections, and in a further six cases a T phenotype was firmly established in paraffin wax sections. Four patients died less than one year after presentation (two with disseminated lymphoma; two from other causes); one died at five years with widespread lymphoma and the remaining seven cases were alive one to 14 1/2 years after presentation. Three of the four patients with associated mycosis fungoides had prolonged survival, contrary to the findings of previous reports which suggest secondary Ki-1 ALCL behaves aggressively. The recognition of these tumours is important because of their relatively good prognosis. The diagnosis can be readily substantiated immunohistochemically, using a simple panel of antibodies. 
Electrophysiological and binding studies on intact NCB-20 cells suggest presence of a low affinity sigma receptor. Whole cell voltage clamp studies were performed on NCB-20 cells to examine physiological responses to drugs possessing affinities for sigma receptors. Those drugs [haloperidol, alpha-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-4-(5-fluoro-2-pyrimidinyl)-1-piperazinebutano l (BMY-14802), pentazocine, N-allylnormetazocine (SKF-10047), 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine (3-PPP), phencyclidine, 1-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine (TCP), (+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo-[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate (MK-801)] caused an apparent inward current, which was due to blockade of a tonic, outward potassium current. The rank order of drug potencies in producing this effect generally resembled the rank orders of sigma-receptor affinities for the drugs, except that a reverse stereoselectivity was observed for several drugs. [3H](+)-SKF-10047 labeled two sites in intact NCB-20 cells (Kd = 49 nM, Bmax = 1.0 pmol/mg protein and Kd = 9.6 microM, Bmax = 69 pmol/mg protein). The high affinity site was similar pharmacologically to the sigma receptor assayed in membrane fragments from NCB-20 cells. However, the low affinity site showed a slightly different profile, highlighted by a reverse stereoselectivity. The rank order of drug potencies was as follows at the low affinity site: haloperidol greater than BMY-14802 greater than (-)-pentazocine greater than (+)-pentazocine greater than (-)-SKF-10047 greater than (-)-3-PPP greater than (+)-SKF-10047 greater than (+)-3-PPP greater than phencyclidine greater than TCP greater than MK-801. 
Endothelin and calcium signaling in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cells. Endothelin (ET)-mediated Ca++ signaling in NG108-15 neuroblastoma x glioma cells was studied by measuring free intracellular Ca++ (Ca++i) levels with the fluorescent Ca++ indicator, fura-2. ET-1 produced biphasic increases in Ca++i consisting of a transient peak elevation followed by a sustained plateau phase. Both peak and plateau Ca++i responses to 5 nM ET-1 were reduced by depletion of extracellular Ca++. Peak responses were also attenuated by inhibitors of inositol phosphate metabolism, whereas plateau responses were affected by dihydropyridine Ca++ channel agonists and antagonists and by differentiation. These results suggest that peak Ca++i responses to ET-1 involve mobilization of Ca++ from inositol phosphate-sensitive intracellular stores and influx of extracellular Ca++ through nonclassical Ca++ channels, whereas plateau responses are mediated by Ca++ influx through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-gated channels. 
Endoscopic biopsy technique for acquiring larger mucosal samples. Biopsies of the esophagus, stomach, and intestine are most often obtained using the traditional advance-and-close method with flexible endoscopes by extending an open forceps several millimeters beyond the endoscope tip to sample the mucosa, all under direct vision. We developed an alternative "turn-and-suction" endoscopic biopsy technique that permits the acquisition of larger mucosal samples. The biopsy forceps is advanced into the lumen, opened, and withdrawn backward until it is flush with the endoscope tip. Next, the endoscope tip is turned gently into the wall while air is suctioned from the lumen, and the biopsy forceps is very slightly advanced and then closed, usually without direct visualization. After straightening the endoscope tip, the biopsy is obtained by withdrawing the forceps and avulsing a superficial mucosal sample. By using this new method, we have safely taken over 10,000 biopsies without complications in endoscopic surveillance research protocols in patients at risk for gastrointestinal cancer. To compare the sizes of biopsies obtained with these two techniques, histologic sections of 341 mucosal samples from 12 patients with chronic ulcerative colitis were studied retrospectively. The mean greatest length of biopsy sections using the traditional technique was 4.72 mm, and using our new technique was 7.35 mm (56% longer). The turn-and-suction endoscopic biopsy method is best applied when flat mucosa is randomly sampled to seek microscopic pathologic changes that are not visible endoscopically, and may be advantageous for various non-histologic research analyses of gastrointestinal mucosa which are limited by tissue quantity. 
A multi-centre collaborative study into the treatment of menorrhagia by Nd-YAG laser ablation of the endometrium. OBJECTIVE--To determine the safety and clinical effectiveness of Nd-YAG laser ablation of the endometrium in the treatment of menorrhagia. DESIGN--A prospective 3-year observational multi-centre study. SETTING--Gynaecological units in the UK and USA with special interest in endoscopic laser surgery. SUBJECTS--859 women with menorrhagia resistant to medical therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Duration of laser ablation, intra- and post-operative complications, amenorrhoea rate, oligomenorrhoea rate, and woman's subjective assessment of treatment. RESULTS--No major complications occurred in 859 treatments. Four (0.4%) cases of transient fluid overload, 4 (0.4%) of infection, and 3 (0.3%) of uterine perforation occurred. Each of the perforations occurred during insertion of the rigid instruments and none was produced by the laser. There were no major haemorrhages, no blood transfusions were needed, and no woman required a laparotomy. The mean duration of the laser ablation was 24 min, and the average stay in hospital was less than 24 h. Of the 479 women followed up for at least 6 months after treatment 288 (60%) developed complete amenorrhoea and 152 (32%) reported continuing but satisfactorily reduced menstruation; 39 (8%) failed to improve with the first treatment, but 26 of them responded to a second laser ablation. Overall 466 (97%) had a satisfactory response to laser ablation and only 13 (3%) required subsequent hysterectomy. CONCLUSION--Endometrial laser ablation would appear to be a popular, safe, effective and economical alternative to hysterectomy for the treatment of menorrhagia. 
Angiographic assessment of the infarct-related residual coronary stenosis after spontaneous or therapeutic thrombolysis The severity of the infarct-related residual coronary stenosis after spontaneous or therapeutic thrombolysis was quantitatively assessed in 91 patients with an acute myocardial infarction who were allocated to treatment in the acute stage with either a thrombolytic agent (100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator given over 3 h, 49 patients) or a placebo (42 patients). Heparin and aspirin were given to both groups until angiography was performed. Digital subtracted images of the infarct-related coronary vessel were obtained 10 to 14 days after hospital admission and were subsequently analyzed with the use of a computer-assisted coronary stenosis measurement system. Neither treatment group differed significantly in age, gender or location of the culprit coronary lesion. Median values (90% range) in the thrombolysis and control groups were, respectively, 1.95 (0.9 to 5.3) mm versus 1.7 (0.9 to 3.4) mm for stenosis length; 1.4 (0.8 to 2.7) mm versus 1.4 (0.9 to 1.8) mm for minimal luminal diameter; 57% (36% to 75%) versus 58% (44% to 71%) for diameter obstruction; 82% (59% to 95%) versus 82% (68% to 92%) for geometric area obstruction; and 78% (58% to 91%) versus 79% (66% to 90%) for densitometric area obstruction. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant for any of these measurements. Thus, in this study no significant differences in anatomy or severity of residual coronary stenosis could be demonstrated at 10 to 14 days after an acute myocardial infarction in patients with a recanalized infarct-related vessel, whether or not thrombolytic therapy was given on admission. These results indicate that with effective antithrombotic treatment, gradual endogenous fibrinolysis or more rapid lysis induced by the infusion of a thrombolytic agent results in a similar infarct-related coronary lesion at the time of hospital discharge. 
Hypertensive renal damage. The primary focus of both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapy should be to control systemic blood pressure in a simple, affordable, and nontoxic fashion that provides an adequate quality of life. Although newer agents provide hope for greater capability of preventing renal dysfunction, their cost may prevent their broad availability in the black hypertensive population (see Chapter 5). Judicious use of traditional therapies, combined with newer approaches when possible, may offer prescribing physicians the best opportunity to control blood pressure in ways to avoid renal dysfunction. The lessons of the past 20 years have taught us that lowering blood pressure by any means helps in reducing target organ damage. More recent observations in hypertensive blacks illustrate the need for improved therapies to prevent renal dysfunction. A more physiologic approach to blood pressure control in the black patient that conserves perfusion to the kidney may delay the development of nephrosclerosis. Increased awareness, educational support, and encouragement will be necessary to insure compliance with therapy for a disease that is largely asymptomatic. 
Epstein-Barr virus and persistent graft dysfunction after liver transplantation. Epstein-Barr virus infection has been associated with a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations, depending on the immune status of the host. In this report, we describe two liver transplant patients who received hepatic allografts from donors serologically positive for Epstein-Barr virus and who experienced primary infection with Epstein-Barr virus associated with prolonged liver graft dysfunction. In both patients, Epstein-Barr serologies converted within 3 mo of liver transplantation, and hepatic histological study revealed mononuclear infiltration of the sinusoids evolving to pronounced immunoblastic features suggestive of evolving lymphoma. In both cases, in situ hybridization studies confirmed the presence of Epstein-Barr virus genome in the liver. Furthermore, polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA were present in biopsy specimens obtained during the episode of acute hepatitis that followed Epstein-Barr virus seroconversion. The degree of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated by polymerase chain reaction appeared to increase in parallel with the progression of parenchymal lymphocytic infiltrates. In one patient, a biopsy sample from a cervical node also revealed high levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA estimated using the polymerase chain reaction technique. Furthermore, in these patients, Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels appeared to decrease dramatically after discontinuing azathioprine administration and beginning treatment with acyclovir. These two cases illustrate the dynamics of Epstein-Barr virus immune regulation and confirm chronic hepatic allograft dysfunction related to Epstein-Barr viral infection. 
Chronic pain: a PET study of the central effects of percutaneous high cervical cordotomy. We have studied 5 patients with unilateral, severe chronic pain due to cancer before and after percutaneous, ventrolateral cervical cordotomy to investigate the central effects of the procedure. The aim was to identify the functional anatomical correlates of abolishing unilateral nociceptive input to the brain. Patients were investigated by positron emission tomography using C15O2 to evaluate cerebral blood flow. Comparisons were made between the patients with unilateral pain before cordotomy and normal volunteers. These demonstrated significantly less blood flow in 3 out of 4 of the individual quadrants of the hemithalamus contralateral to the side of pain (P less than 0.01-0.05). These differences were abolished by cordotomy. Comparison of the patients before and after cordotomy showed a significant decrease in blood flow in the dorsal anterior quadrant of the thalamus contralateral to the side of pain (P less than 0.05) which was normalised after cordotomy. There were no significant changes in the prefrontal or primary somatosensory cortex. We conclude that chronic pain results in a decrease of synaptic activity at thalamic level either from decreased activity in neurones projecting to that region and/or attenuated local neuronal firing. We have demonstrated no secondary remote effects in cortex, indicating the importance of subcortical mechanisms in central responses to chronic pain. 
A fatality after antipyrine administration. An 87-year-old woman died after the administration of an intravenous injection of antipyrine during the course of an investigation of the efficacy of oxerutins in venous ulceration. This is believed to be the first such fatality. 
Evaluation of neck lymph node dissection for thoracic esophageal carcinoma We studied a series of 150 patients treated for thoracic esophageal carcinoma at our institution. The patients were divided into two matched groups. Group B underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenectomy only; group A also underwent bilateral neck lymph node dissection. The rates of operative mortality and operative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. The 5-year survival rate was 38.7% overall (48.7% in group A and 33.7% in group B). Group A had a significantly better survival curve than group B. Twenty patients (26.0%) in group A had metastasis in the dissected neck lymph nodes. The 4-year survival rate of these patients was 47.9%. The significantly better survival of group A and the satisfactory prognosis in the patients with positive cervical lymph nodes demonstrates the effectiveness of neck lymph node dissection in radical operation for thoracic esophageal carcinoma. 
Danazol-induced hepatocellular adenomas. A case report and review of the literature. We report a case of hepatocellular adenomas in a 39-year-old woman who had been taking danazol for uterine fibroids. To our knowledge, this is the first case in which multiple hepatocellular adenomas were discovered after only 6 months of danazol intake. 
Extramedullary nasal plasmacytoma. The literature on this rare tumour has been reviewed and three cases of nasal plasmacytoma are described. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic IgA and Kappa determinants in all cases. Two patients are disease-free at the present time, the third developed an IgG-k multiple myeloma, previously not described in the literature. 
The nature of elder impairment and its impact on family caregivers' health and psychosocial functioning. This study assessed the nature of elder impairment and its impact on the health and psychosocial functioning of family caregivers. All caregivers were daughters or daughters-in-law living with an elderly parent. Contrary to expectations and previous research, no differences were revealed among caregivers of cognitively impaired, functionally impaired, and nonimpaired elderly relatives in terms of self-reported health or psychosocial functioning. Thus, other aspects of the caregiving context, such as familial generation, gender, and living arrangement, may affect caregiver health and psychosocial functioning more than the nature of the elder's impairment. 
Leukoaraiosis correlates with cerebral hypoperfusion in vascular dementia. Leukoaraiosis quantified by computerized densitometric measurements of reduced Hounsfield numbers was correlated with local cerebral blood flow on the same computed tomographic images of 35 patients with multi-infarct dementia and 16 age-matched elderly normal volunteers. The ratio for area of frontal leukoaraiosis to total area of parenchyma among the patients was significantly greater than that among the normal volunteers (5.8 +/- 2.3% compared with 3.1 +/- 1.3%, p less than 0.001). Severity of leukoaraiosis around the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles correlated significantly with severity of leukoaraiosis of the centrum semiovale adjacent to the bodies of the lateral ventricles. Cerebral blood flow values for all representative cerebral regions except the parietal white matter were reduced among the patients compared with the normal volunteers. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that reduced cerebral perfusion in the putamen and thalamus correlated significantly with the severity of leukoaraiosis. Cerebral hypoperfusion in territories supplied by deep penetrating arteries may contribute to the pathogenesis of leukoaraiosis. 
Ataxic hemiparesis associated with ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome caused by a paracentral gyrus lesion. The authors report a case of ataxic hemiparesis and an ipsilateral cerebellar syndrome in relation to a glioblastoma of the paracentral gyrus region. The physiopathology of this clinical presentation caused by compression of the corticopontine tract is discussed. 
Responsiveness of peripheral veins to vasodilators and the effect of nifedipine on alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in hypertension. Vasodilators have varying hemodynamic properties that may be important in determining their efficacy for different disorders. We used the dorsal hand vein technique to measure the effects of several vasodilators infused locally and to measure the action of systemically administered nifedipine. The venodilatory effects of hydralazine, verapamil, diazoxide, and nitroglycerin were determined in peripheral veins of healthy subjects. The potency (ED50, the dose producing half-maximal response) was as follows: nitroglycerin (0.0007 micrograms/min) greater than verapamil (6.5 micrograms/min) greater than diazoxide (75 micrograms/min) greater than hydralazine (660 micrograms/min). The effect of oral nifedipine on alpha-adrenergic responsiveness of hand veins was determined. Nifedipine given in therapeutic doses for the treatment of hypertension was associated with a threefold increase in the ED50 for phenylephrine (92 to 277 ng/min; p less than 0.05) and norepinephrine (2.9 to 11.5 ng/min; p less than 0.05). Therapeutic doses of nifedipine are associated with measurable shifts in the dose-response curves to these two alpha-adrenergic agonists in the hand vein. The hand vein technique can be used not only to compare the potency of locally infused drugs but also to measure venous effects of vasoactive drugs at therapeutic concentrations achieved after systemic administration. 
Cytomegalovirus esophagitis in AIDS: diagnosis by endoscopic biopsy. We have reviewed 28 esophageal biopsies from 28 patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), over a 1-yr period. Indications for esophageal biopsy were dysphagia persisting after antifungal therapy and/or radiologic evidence of esophageal ulcer. We compared the frequency of detecting cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain with immunoperoxidase staining for CMV antigens. Five biopsies were positive for CMV by H&E stain and immunoperoxidase. Infected cells could often be identified in the granulation tissue and, in one severe case, in stromal papillae of the intact mucosa. Squamous cells were never positive. Thirteen biopsies consisted only of squamous epithelium, and all of these were negative by both techniques. Among the remaining 10 cases, no CMV inclusions were identified by H&E. Three of these biopsies displayed staining for viral antigens. In all cases positive by immunoperoxidase, numerous cells positive for viral antigens did not display any of the CMV-specific morphologic diagnostic criteria. Other coexisting diagnoses included candidiasis, Kaposi's sarcoma, and malignant lymphoma. We conclude 1) CMV infection of the esophagus is common in AIDS patients with esophageal ulcer or esophagitis resistant to antifungal therapy; 2) multiple infections or neoplasms may coexist; 3) since CMV apparently does not infect squamous epithelium and only rarely endothelium in stromal papillae, deep biopsies are necessary for diagnosis; and 4) immunoperoxidase staining is required for maximum diagnostic yield. 
Cerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children. Using magnetic resonance imaging 20 language- and learning-impaired children were compared with 12 normal control subjects. Gross brain structure was remarkably normal in the language- and learning-impaired group. Semiautomated morphometry was used to measure hemispheric volumes and cerebral asymmetries in six cerebral regions. The volume of the left posterior perisylvian region was significantly reduced in language- and learning-impaired children. Asymmetries in inferoanterior and superoposterior cerebral regions were also significantly different in this group. Results of descriptive group comparisons of estimated volumes of other cerebral gray-matter structures raise the possibility that some language- and learning-impaired children may have additional volume reductions in cortical and subcortical structures. The results suggest that hemispheric specialization of function may be anomalous in this population. 
Noninfectious colitis associated with short gut syndrome in infants. We describe noninfectious bloody diarrhea in 13 of 16 infants referred for management of short bowel syndrome and parenteral nutrition during a 33-month period. The condition was characterized by bloody, watery stools associated with carbohydrate malabsorption. Colitis occurred at a mean age of 4.2 months during periods of advancing enteral feedings of a hydrolyzed protein- or amino acid-containing formula. Sigmoidoscopy performed in nine patients revealed edema, patchy erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, and mucosal friability without ulcerations or pseudomembranes. Colonic biopsy specimens demonstrated edema and mixed hypercellularity of the lamina propria, with prominent eosinophilia. Rectal bleeding ceased if formula feedings were decreased or withheld. Of multiple medications administered, sulfasalazine seemed to improve rectal bleeding most effectively in our patients and allowed for more rapid reintroduction of enteral feedings. 
Stroke and hypertension and its prevention. Systolic and diastolic hypertension in both men and women is a well-established risk factor for the development of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Antihypertensive treatment decreases the risk, but questions remain as to the precise level of hypertension to be treated, whether the effects of antihypertensive treatment are blunted with increasing age, and the best type of antihypertensive drug or combination of drugs to be used. Further questions remain concerning the incidence of pseudohypertension and the potentially harmful effects of its treatment on the brain, and the possibility that fluctuations in blood pressure may be worse than elevation alone. A pragmatic approach would be to treat hypertension with vigor in the young, with caution in the mature, and with reluctance in the old. 
Relative roles of cardiac and arterial baroreceptors in vasopressin regulation during hemorrhage in conscious dogs. To determine the relative roles of cardiac and sinoaortic baroreceptors in mediation of arginine vasopressin (AVP) release, hemorrhage was performed in five groups of conscious splenectomized dogs: 1) all nerves intact; 2) either chronic surgical or acute pharmacological (intrapericardial lidocaine) cardiac denervation (CD); 3) chronic sinoarotic denervation (SAD); 4) combined chronic sinoartic denervation plus either chronic or acute cardiac denervation (SAD + CD); and 5) all nerves intact, but with ganglionic blockade. Hemorrhage (0.5 ml/min/kg) reduced mean arterial pressure similarly in the intact and CD groups. Decreases in mean arterial pressure were augmented in SAD, SAD + CD, and ganglion-blocked groups compared with responses in intact and CD groups. There were no differences in responses of plasma AVP to hemorrhage in the intact and CD groups, but the AVP response was significantly blunted in the SAD + CD group as compared with SAD alone. When compared during the early stage of hemorrhage, at the same reduction in mean arterial pressure, the rise in AVP was greater in the ganglion-blocked group than in the SAD + CD group, but was less than in the intact group. With a protocol to reduce mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg over the same period (42 +/- 0.6 minutes) in four of the groups, the blood volume required to reduce mean arterial pressure by 20 mm Hg was similar in the intact (20 +/- 1 ml/kg) and CD (21 +/- 1 ml/kg) groups, but was less in the SAD (12 +/- 1 ml/kg) and SAD + CD (12 +/- 1 ml/kg) groups. Again, similar increases were observed in AVP between the intact (50 +/- 9 pg/ml) and CD (51 +/- 9 pg/ml) groups, whereas increases in AVP were diminished in the SAD (11 +/- 3 pg/ml) and SAD + CD (7 +/- 2 pg/ml) groups. In the presence of an AVP antagonist, decreases in mean arterial pressure and increases in total peripheral resistance with hemorrhage were affected similarly in both the intact and CD groups, whereas hemodynamic impairment by AVP blockade was less marked in the SAD and SAD + CD groups. These results indicate that cardiac receptors are not the major regulators of AVP release during progressive hemorrhage in conscious dogs. However, when the complicating influences of sinoaortic reflexes were eliminated, a modest role for cardiac receptors was uncovered. 
Excimer laser-facilitated balloon angioplasty of a nondilatable lesion. Preliminary clinical experience with excimer laser coronary angioplasty shows that it is a safe and effective means of achieving nonsurgical coronary revascularization in selected patients but specific indications for its use are as yet undefined. In the present report a specific indication is proposed for the use of the excimer laser: to facilitate balloon inflation in a rigid stenosis that fails to dilate despite high balloon inflation pressures. 
Disc degeneration in magnetic resonance imaging. A comparative biochemical, histologic, and radiologic study in cadaver spines. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of 89 autopsied intervertebral discs from 22 cadaveric lumbar spines were correlated with biochemical composition, conventional radiography, and histologic structure to study the nature of disc intensity changes seen in MRI. Discs with a low signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI were characterized by shortening of relaxation times, dehydration, and decreases in total proteoglycan content and chondroitin-keratan sulfate ratios in the nucleus pulposus. This corresponded well with previously published studies. In histologic structure, no obvious differences between MRI findings were found. In conclusion, a low signal intensity in a lumbar disc on T2-weighted MRI probably reflects a true biochemical disc degeneration, but its relation to structural degenerative changes is uncertain. Therefore, MRI seems to be a sensitive and a specific imaging modality for detecting pathologic biochemical disc changes in the spine of a young adult. 
Marijuana as antiemetic medicine: a survey of oncologists' experiences and attitudes. A random-sample, anonymous survey of the members of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) was conducted in spring 1990 measuring the attitudes and experiences of American oncologists concerning the antiemetic use of marijuana in cancer chemotherapy patients. The survey was mailed to about one third (N = 2,430) of all United States-based ASCO members and yielded a response rate of 43% (1,035). More than 44% of the respondents report recommending the (illegal) use of marijuana for the control of emesis to at least one cancer chemotherapy patient. Almost one half (48%) would prescribe marijuana to some of their patients if it were legal. As a group, respondents considered smoked marijuana to be somewhat more effective than the legally available oral synthetic dronabinol ([THC] Marinol; Unimed, Somerville, NJ) and roughly as safe. Of the respondents who expressed an opinion, a majority (54%) thought marijuana should be available by prescription. These results bear on the question of whether marijuana has a "currently accepted medical use," at issue in an ongoing administrative and legal dispute concerning whether marijuana in smoked form should be available by prescription along with synthetic THC in oral form. This survey demonstrates that oncologists' experience with the medical use of marijuana is more extensive, and their opinions of it are more favorable, than the regulatory authorities appear to have believed. 
Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients. A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events. 
Reversible renal insufficiency due to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in hypertensive nephrosclerosis. OBJECTIVE: To review the incidence of reversible renal insufficiency in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis undergoing antihypertensive therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of 73 patients in a long-term blood pressure control study that compared the effects of an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor plus conventional antihypertensive agents compared with placebo plus antihypertensive agents. SETTING: Hospital-based outpatient treatment center. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were divided into group 1, which received enalapril plus conventional antihypertensives, and group 2, which received placebo plus conventional antihypertensives. MEASUREMENTS: Blood pressure and serum creatinine levels were measured, and imaging studies of the main renal arteries were done. MAIN RESULTS: In group 1, eight of 42 patients (19%, 95% CI, 9% to 34%) developed reversible renal insufficiency, defined as an unexpected increase in serum creatinine of 88 mumol/L or higher. Six episodes of reversible renal insufficiency occurred during July and August when temperatures were 32.2 degrees C to 37.8 degrees C (90 degrees F to 100 degrees F). Renal artery stenosis was excluded by renal arteriogram or ultrasonic duplex scanning. All eight group-1 patients had a significant decrease in mean arterial pressure below their baseline level during reversible renal insufficiency (mean change, -28 +/- 10 mm Hg, P less than 0.001). The increase in the serum creatinine level was inversely correlated with the decrease in the mean arterial pressure (r = -0.68, P less than 0.01). Reversible renal insufficiency was successfully managed by withdrawing or reducing enalapril as well as other antihypertensive agents. Subsequently, enalapril was tolerated by seven of the eight patients without recurrence of renal insufficiency. In contrast, none of 31 (CI, 0% to 11%) patients in group 2 developed reversible renal insufficiency despite the fact that both the incidence of decreases in mean arterial pressure in 6 of 31 patients (19%) and the magnitude of the decreases in mean arterial pressure (mean change, -33 +/- 16 mm Hg) were similar to those observed in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Reversible renal insufficiency in hypertensive nephrosclerosis associated with ACE inhibitor therapy correlates with relative hypotension, is not dependent on renal artery stenosis, and can usually be managed by dose reduction. 
Partial lamellar sclerouvectomy for ciliary body and choroidal tumors. The authors reviewed the postoperative course, visual results, histopathologic findings, and mortality data on 95 consecutive patients with tumors of the ciliary body and/or choroid who were managed by a partial lamellar sclerouvectomy. This surgical procedure is designed to remove the uveal tumor and leave intact the outer sclera and sensory retina. In this group of 95 patients, vitreous hemorrhage occurred in 79 (83%) cases, intraretinal or subretinal hemorrhage in 33 (35%), retinal detachment in 26 (28%), and cataract in 32 (34%). Most of the vitreous and retinal hemorrhages resolved spontaneously, sometimes leaving subretinal or preretinal fibrosis. A number of the postoperative retinal detachments resolved spontaneously, but retinal detachment surgery was necessary in 16 patients (17%), mostly in the earlier years of the survey. Most of the cataracts were mild and did not require surgery. The eventual postoperative visual acuity was equal to or better than the preoperative visual acuity in 23 cases (24%) over a mean follow-up period of 5 years. Enucleation was eventually necessary in 15 cases (16%), usually because of residual or recurrent tumor. Histopathologic diagnosis was uveal melanoma in 81 cases (85%) and other tumors in 14 cases (15%). There were no orbital recurrences, but distant metastases developed in five patients (5%), all of whom had undergone enucleation for recurrence of the intraocular melanoma. Although the surgical technique is difficult, partial lamellar sclerouvectomy appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option in selected cases of posterior uveal tumors. 
Anaesthetic management of myocardial infarction in a parturient. Myocardial infarction is encountered rarely during pregnancy, but when it occurs the event is life-threatening to both mother and fetus. Data on maternal and fetal outcome are limited, but overall maternal mortality approaches 35%, and 40% of deaths occur during the third trimester. We present a case of myocardial infarction occurring at 38 weeks gestation, and discuss the anaesthetic management of the problems encountered during labour and delivery. 
National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group report on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Blood pressure measurements obtained in a physician's office may not represent a patient's blood pressure during an entire day. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) provides multiple readings over time. This review of the literature on ABPM addresses the current state of ABPM methods, normal blood pressure profiles, the clinical and research uses of ABPM, cost considerations, and recommendations for use of ABPM in selected circumstances. Current ABPM devices use either auscultatory or oscillometric methods to determine blood pressure. A rigorous comparison of these methods is needed to determine whether one method is more reliable. A nonbiased assessment of all available equipment is necessary. Normative data provided by ABPM research are needed for populations by age, race, gender, body habitus, and conditions, such as pregnancy. While ABPM is not cost-effective for all hypertensive patients, it can assist in the evaluation of such problems as target organ complications, syncopal episodes, episodic hypertension, and autonomic dysfunction. 
Reversible hypertriiodothyroninaemia due to adrenal insufficiency. It is well known that an excess of glucocorticoids affects thyroid tests. The effect of adrenal deficiency on thyroid hormones is less well defined. We here describe the case of a 33-year-old woman with Cushing's disease who was cured by trans-sphenoidal surgery. During the postoperative period, a secondary adrenal insufficiency developed. The thyroid blood tests then revealed elevated L-triiodothyronine (T3) levels and a decrease in reverse T3. These findings suggest that secondary adrenal deficiency may be associated with high T3 levels, which may be due to an increase in the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3. 
Survival and vehicular spread of human rotaviruses: possible relation to seasonality of outbreaks. In developing countries rotavirus infections account for nearly 6% of all diarrheal episodes and for 20% of diarrhea-associated deaths of young children. Even in industrialized countries rotavirus diarrhea in the young is among the leading causes of hospitalization. In temperate regions institutional outbreaks of the disease occur mainly in cold dry weather, whereas in tropical settings the seasonality is less well defined. Waterborne outbreaks of rotavirus gastroenteritis have been recorded; air, hands, fomities, and food may also act as vehicles for this infection. Rotaviruses can survive for weeks in potable and recreational waters and for at least 4 hours on human hands. In air and on nonporous inanimate surfaces, the survival of rotaviruses is favored by a relative humidity of less than or equal to 50% and viral infectivity can be retained for several days. Rotaviruses are relatively resistant to commonly used hard-surface disinfectants and hygienic hand-wash agents. 
Stress hormone and blood glucose response following acute stroke in the elderly. We studied the relation of reactive hyperglycemia, stress hormone response, and outcome in 23 consecutive elderly patients (median age 80 [range 75-92] years) following an acute first stroke. The median delay from the onset of the stroke to the first blood sample (day 0) was 9 (range 4-22) hours. Subsequent blood samples were taken, after fasting, for the determination of blood glucose, cortisol, catecholamine, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and lactate concentrations on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 30, and 90. For all 23 patients, a significant relation was found between the blood glucose concentration and survival (p = 0.03) and the blood glucose concentration decreased with time (p less than 0.001). There was also a significant relation between blood glucose concentration and outcome (p = 0.02). For the 15 patients with complete data, the major determinants of the blood glucose concentration were the cortisol, insulin, and glucagon concentrations (all p less than 0.001), which accounted for 42% of the variance. When all the indexes were analyzed together by logistic regression, only the cortisol concentration was related to outcome (p = 0.02). Hyperglycemia following a stroke probably reflects the intensity of the stress hormone response. We have confirmed that hyperglycemia is a predictor of outcome in persons with stroke. 
Diagnostic relevance of trigeminal evoked potentials following infraorbital nerve stimulation. A new tool in neurophysiological exploration of the trigeminal nerve has recently been introduced. It has been demonstrated that stimulation of the infraorbital nerve trunk gives rise to very reliable scalp responses reflecting the activity of the afferent pathway between the maximally nerve and the brain stem. The authors demonstrate that alterations of such trigeminal evoked responses fit with documented pathological processes at various locations along the trigeminal pathway (maxillary sinus, parasellar region, and within the brain-stem parenchyma). They report the findings in 68 patients suffering from "idiopathic" trigeminal neuralgia. Alterations of the response were detected in 33 cases, suggesting that some damage of the nerve had taken place either at the root entry zone into the pons (23 cases) or slightly distal to it (10 cases). Such results support the hypothesis that trigeminal neuralgia may be due to a compression of the trigeminal root at the pons entry zone. 
The 72-hour examination as a predictor of recovery in motor complete quadriplegia. Twenty-nine C4 to C7 motor-complete spinal cord injured subjects were evaluated to determine whether the manual muscle test (MMT) performed within 24 hours of injury or at 72 hours after injury better predicts short-term functional muscle recovery. A single muscle in the zone of injury that had a muscle grade between 1 and 3, inclusive, was evaluated serially in each patient from admission to three months. Increase in muscle strength to grade 4 or better was defined as success. Outcomes were evaluated by the Fisher exact test. Using the less-than-24-hour MMT, 12 of 17 subjects with grade 3 muscle strength vs four of 12 subjects with grade 1 or 2 muscle strength achieved success (p greater than .05). Using the 72-hour MMT, all 11 subjects with grade 3 muscle strength vs five of the 18 subjects with less than grade 3 muscle strength achieved success (p less than .001). Short-term functional muscle recovery in the zone of injury in cervical motor-complete quadriplegia is better predicted by the 72-hour MMT than by the less-than-24-hour MMT. 
Idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia of mesenteric veins. Nonthrombotic occlusion or stenosis of the mesenteric veins is a rare cause of intestinal ischemia that usually occurs in association with systemic vasculitis. The current report includes four male patients with segmental ischemic colitis caused by idiopathic myointimal hyperplasia in the small mesenteric veins and their intramural branches; neither vasculitis nor arterial involvement were present. Three of the four patients were less than or equal to 38 years of age; the fourth was 67. All four patients were previously healthy and had no history of drug use of any kind. Clinical findings included abdominal pain, diarrhea, bloody stools, and colonic strictures discovered by barium enema. The intima of the mesenteric and intestinal mural veins was focally thickened by a marked increase in cells and matrix between the endothelium and internal elastic lamina, whereas the vessel walls external to the thickened intima appeared normal. Histochemistry and immunoreactivity with antibodies to muscle-specific actins (HHF-35) disclosed that the intimal thickening was caused by proliferation of smooth muscle cells in a proteoglycan matrix. All patients recovered completely after segmental resection of the ischemic portion of the colon and had no recurrence of intestinal symptoms on follow-up of up to 7 years. These unusual venous lesions do not appear to have been previously described; their etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown. 
Recurrent spinal cord tethering by sacral nerve root following lipomyelomeningocele surgery. Case report. A 21-year-old woman had recurrent progressive weakness/hypesthesia and pain in both lower extremities. At the age of 5 and 19 years, she had undergone surgical resection of a lipomyelomeningocele at L5-S1. Surgical exploration revealed that the cord was tethered and pulled over to the side by an excessively short right S-1 nerve root. The contralateral L-5 and S-1 nerve roots were markedly stretched. Division of the right S-1 nerve root resulted in prompt disappearance of pain in the lower extremities and improvement in neurological function. 
Effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor on rodent gliomas and normal brain. In a study examining the possible therapeutic effects of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (rHuTNF-alpha) on malignant gliomas without expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptors, RG-2 glioma cells were tested in vitro as well as in a rat experimental glioma model. A growth inhibition assay revealed no inhibiting effect in vitro up to a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml rHuTNF-alpha. Receptor-binding studies showed that RG-2 cells did not present specific receptors for rHuTNF-alpha. The pharmacokinetics of rHuTNF-alpha after intravenous injection were studied with respect to serum, tissue, and brain tumor concentrations and showed increased glioma concentrations of (mean +/- standard error of the mean) 0.47 +/- 0.18 ng TNF/mg brain compared to 0.15 +/- 0.05 ng TNF/mg brain in the normal contralateral hemisphere. No therapeutic effect on solid RG-2 gliomas could be observed after stereotactic injection of 7.3 micrograms rHuTNF/10 microliter buffer solution into the tumor in 10 animals. Immunohistochemical studies after stereotactic injection of rHuTNF-alpha showed total disappearance of the substance after 24 hours without internalization into tumor cells. Stereotactic injection of 7.3 micrograms rHuTNF 10 microliters into normal brain resulted in marked inflammatory response around the injection track, including microvascular thrombosis. These results demonstrate that rHuTNF has neither direct nor indirect cytotoxic activity on RG-2 glioma cells. Furthermore, before clinical use of rHuTNF-alpha in malignant gliomas, the authors suggest that receptor studies be done in each patient. In receptor-positive patients undergoing treatment with rHuTNF-alpha, precautions should be taken to prevent local encephalitic reactions. 
Mid-brain pathology of Wilson's disease: MRI analysis of three cases. MRI scans were obtained from three patients with Wilson's disease, all of whom showed rigidity and dysarthria; two also showed tremor and dystonia. Two had been treated with D-penicillamine for seven and 14 years, respectively and their neurological abnormalities had improved, but the third patient had not been treated. T2-weighted MRI of the mid-brain in all three revealed the characteristic "face of the giant panda" sign, consisting of high signal intensity in the tegmentum except for red nucleus, preservation of signal intensity of the lateral portion of the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and hypo-intensity of the superior colliculus. The clinical significance of these MRI abnormalities is discussed. 
In vitro activities of acridone alkaloids against Pneumocystis carinii. Acridone alkaloids isolated from plants of the family Rutaceae have antiplasmodial activity in rodent models of malaria. Because a variety of antimalarial agents have also been shown to have activity against Pneumocystis carinii, we tested six of these alkaloids in an established culture model for P. carinii. Atalaphillinine and glycobismine A inhibited growth of cultured P. carinii at concentrations of 2.7 and 1.7 microM, respectively. This potency of effect is similar to that of chloroquine (3 microM) but somewhat less than that of primaquine (0.4 microM), which was previously evaluated in the same system. 
Survivorship analysis and confidence intervals. An assessment with reference to the Stanmore total knee replacement. Survivorship analysis is a useful way of expressing the long-term results of joint replacement: it provides a means of comparing the life span of one type of prosthesis with another. However, such studies should include a full life-table and the confidence intervals for the survival rates at given times. At least 40 surviving prostheses are required to provide reliable results. 
Proteus syndrome. Ultrastructural study of linear verrucous and depigmented nevi. Proteus syndrome is a rare hamartomatous disorder characterized by multifocal overgrowths that can involve any structure of the body. Clinical manifestations include macrodactyly, hemihypertrophy, subcutaneous masses, exostosis, cerebroid thickening of palms and soles, and linear skin lesions. About 50 cases have been described, but the ultrastructural features of the linear skin lesions have not been characterized. We describe the clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural findings for a 30-year-old patient who had a mild form of Proteus syndrome with linear lesions characterized by a mixed pattern of hyperkeratosis and depigmentation. Light microscopy of the linear nevus showed acanthosis and hyperorthokeratosis. Electron microscopy revealed extensive vacuolation at the interface between melanocytes and keratinocytes, with large aggregations of densely packed granules in the intercellular space. Melanocytes showed only slight degenerative changes. An immunohistochemical study of the expression of epidermal growth factor receptors revealed no significant abnormalities. 
An apparent cluster of congenital hypopituitarism in central Massachusetts: magnetic resonance imaging and hormonal studies. Between 1980 and 1989, five infants (four males and one female) with congenital hypopituitarism were born within a relatively sparsely populated area of central Massachusetts, an incidence 25-fold greater than expected. In all infants the pituitary stalk was undetectable on magnetic resonance imaging, and a bright spot on T-1 weighted imaging, probably representing posterior pituitary tissue, was found ectopically located inferior to the median eminence. The height of the anterior pituitary remnant on magnetic resonance imaging varied from undetectable to 4 mm, and similarly, on hormonal testing a spectrum of deficiencies of GH, TSH, ACTH, and gonadotropin was observed. The magnitude of the hypopituitarism was less in the three patients whose anterior pituitary remnant was greater than 2 mm, and in them, TRH testing resulted in exaggerated TSH and PRL responses, suggestive of hypothalamic disease. In contrast, in the other two patients in whom the anterior pituitary remnant was less than 2 mm in height, hypopituitarism was more severe, and TRH administration resulted in little if any TSH or PRL response, characteristic of pituitary disease. The size of the anterior pituitary remnant correlated significantly with that of the ectopic posterior pituitary bright spot (P less than 0.005). We conclude that patients with congenital hypopituitarism may exhibit a spectrum of hormonal responses, varying from findings typical of hypothalamic to those characteristic of primary pituitary disease. The pattern of hormonal responsiveness is dependent on the quantity of residual anterior pituitary tissue and probably results from abnormal transport of the hypothalamic hypophyseal releasing hormones rather than to any putative hypothalamic abnormality. The significant correlation between the size and function of the anterior pituitary gland and the size of the ectopic posterior pituitary remnant suggests that the fetal pituitary gland may secrete a factor necessary for the growth and descent of the neuroepithelium to form the infundibulum and posterior pituitary gland. 
Pediatric heart transplantation for congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy. Orthotopic heart transplantation has become an accepted therapy for adult patients with end-stage heart disease. In newborns and infants, this procedure is still controversial because of the unknown long-term results and the lack of donor organs. Since March 1988, we have performed orthotopic heart transplantation in 11 infants and children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n = 6), cardiomyopathy (n = 4), or congenital endocardial fibroelastosis (n = 1). The smallest infant was 3 days old and weighed 2,650 g. Four of 15 potential donors had to be refused for various medical reasons, and 4 were transferred to our hospital for organ retrieval. Seven hearts were procured remotely. We accepted weight mismatches up to 105% between donor and recipient. There were three perioperative deaths, two in patients 5 and 17 days old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and 1 in a 2-year-old patient with a dilated cardiomyopathy. All 3 patients had drug-resistant right heart failure. A 2-year-old girl with a dilated cardiomyopathy died 2 months after transplantation owing to severe pulmonary embolism originating from the superior vena cava. The remaining 7 patients are alive and well between 1 month and 31 months after transplantation. Angiographic follow-up has not revealed signs of graft atherosclerosis at 2 years. 
Metastatic basal cell carcinoma: report of twelve cases with a review of the literature. Metastatic basal cell carcinoma was found in 12 patients at the University of Wisconsin Mohs Surgery Clinic during the period 1936 to 1989. All patients were white men. The time of onset of the primary tumor ranged from childhood to 71 years. Eleven patients had previous treatment for basal cell carcinoma; two patients had received x-ray radiation to the face for teenage acne. The locations of the primary basal cell carcinomas were the face (n = 10), back (n = 1), and arm (n = 1). The primary tumors ranged from 3.6 x 3.0 to 20.0 x 7.0 cm. The interval from onset to the first sign of metastases ranged from 7 to 34 years. In all cases, the primary tumor was histologically identical to the metastatic lesion. Perineural extension of the basal cell carcinoma in the primary lesion was found in five cases. Regional lymph nodes were the most frequent site of metastasis. Treatment consisted of a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Only two patients survived more than 5 years after surgical treatment. One patient has survived 25 years and is still alive. 
Complete external iliac artery disruption after percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty in two young children: successful repair with hypogastric artery transposition. The majority of vascular injuries in young children are iatrogenic. This is a report of two complete external iliac artery disruptions occurring during percutaneous transfemoral balloon aortic valvuloplasty in a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old child. The damaged external iliac artery was bypassed by extensively mobilizing the hypogastric surgery and rotating it upward to anastomose it to the proximal common femoral artery. Normal limb pulses, function, and growth were noted in follow-up. 
Sarcomatous change in a teratoma after treatment of testicular carcinoma. Treatment can transform the metastases of nonseminomatous germ cell carcinoma into histologically mature teratoma. These lesions typically have a benign clinical course. The authors present a case of leiomyosarcoma occurring within such a lesion. It arose 18 years after therapy for metastatic embryonal carcinoma of the testis and appears to have been radiation induced. 
Embolization of cardiac myxomas masquerading as polyarteritis nodosa. Cardiac myxomas are rare tumors which can mimic other diseases. We describe a 19-year-old man who presented clinically with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Muscle biopsy showed vasculitis, but corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy was initially effective. Cardiac myxomas were found by echocardiogram when the disease relapsed and were resected surgically. Segmental arterial aneurysms and stenoses were found on angiography after leg ischemia. We suggest that echocardiography should be performed in all cases of clinically suspected PAN. 
Streptococcus salivarius meningitis and colonic carcinoma. Streptococcus salivarius caused fulminant meningitis in an elderly patient. A gastrointestinal diagnostic workup revealed an asymptomatic colonic adenocarcinoma. This first reported instance of S salivarius sepsis associated with a colonic neoplasm is not unexpected, since the organism is bacteriologically similar to S bovis, the prime bacterial indicator of occult malignancy. Exact speciation of streptococcal strains is fraught with technical difficulties, and gastrointestinal investigation may be warranted in an expanded variety of streptococcal infections. 
Acute bronchitis in children: building a clinical definition. Much about acute bronchitis in children is uncertain, even its definition. This study was undertaken to help build a clinical definition to serve as a guide for further research. Charts of 180 children 1 to 12 years old were reviewed. Each had received a diagnosis of acute bronchitis (54 patients), upper respiratory infection with a cough (128 patients), or a new diagnosis of asthma (26 patients) during the previous 12 months. A history of sputum production (odds ration 25.0, p = 0.0001), the finding of rales or rhonchi on examination (OR 11.6, p less than 0.0001), and a past history of lower respiratory illness (OR 3.0, p = 0.01) were associated with a diagnosis of acute bronchitis, but fever and duration of illness were not. In addition, the diagnosis of acute bronchitis was strongly associated with a prescription for an antibiotic. In a child with a cough, acute bronchitis is more likely to be diagnosed if there is a history of sputum production, rales or rhonchi on examination, and a past history of lower respiratory disease. 
Shock wave lithotripsy of gallstones: results and 12-month follow-up in 174 patients. At the authors' institution, as part of the on-going Dornier National Biliary Lithotripsy Study, 174 patients with gallstones were randomly assigned to receive either ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or placebo for 6 months after undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Six weeks after ESWL, 40 (23%) patients were re-treated for gallstone fragments larger than 5 mm in diameter. No significant difference in the UDCA- and placebo-treated patients was noted. The overall 6- and 12-month stone-free rates for all patients with initially noncalcified stones were as follows: UDCA patients, 31% and 36%, respectively, and placebo patients, 21% and 23%, respectively (P less than .05). In patients with a single, noncalcified gallstone that was at most 20 mm in diameter, the 12-month stone-free rates were as follows: UDCA patients, 60%, and placebo patients, 33% (P less than .01). Patients with noncalcified stones that were 11-20 mm in diameter who were treated with UDCA had a higher rate of stone clearance than placebo patients. At 6 months, the authors' previous study demonstrated no significant difference in the two groups of patients. However, the stone-free rate at 12 months was noted to be significantly higher for patients with a single, noncalcified stone that was at most 20 mm in diameter begun on UDCA than for all other groups of patients. 
In vivo thrombin inhibition enhances and sustains arterial recanalization with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator. The effects of heparin and the synthetic competitive thrombin inhibitor (2R,4R)-4-methyl-1-[N2-(3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-8-quinolinesulfon yl)-L-arginyl]-2-piperidinecarboxylic acid monohydrate (Argatroban) on thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was studied in groups of six or seven rabbits with arterial thrombosis. The model consisted of a whole-blood clot produced in a 1-cm isolated femoral arterial segment with superimposed endothelial damage and distal high-grade stenosis. rt-PA was injected as an intravenous bolus of 0.45 mg/kg body wt at 15-minute intervals until recanalization, or up to a maximum of four boluses. In seven rabbits given an intravenous injection of 17 mg/kg aspirin, rt-PA induced transient reflow in only one animal. In seven rabbits that received intravenous heparin (200 units/kg over 60 minutes), rt-PA administration produced reflow in five animals, which was persistent in two rabbits. Combined administration of aspirin and heparin in seven rabbits was associated with similar rt-PA-induced recanalization. rt-PA administration in six rabbits given intravenous Argatroban (100 micrograms/kg/min for 60 minutes) caused recanalization in five, with persistent patency in three. In six rabbits given aspirin and Argatroban, rt-PA caused recanalization in all, with persistent patency in five animals. Reflow occurred significantly more rapidly with Argatroban (14 +/- 7 minutes) than with heparin (35 +/- 11 minutes), reflow was obtained with fewer boluses of rt-PA in combination with Argatroban (median value of one bolus) than with heparin (median value, three boluses), and reocclusion after reflow was less frequent with Argatroban (0 of 11 versus 5 of 10 rabbits). Furthermore, the degree of thrombolysis determined by pathological analysis was significantly more extensive with Argatroban than with heparin, and patency persisted during a 3-hour observation period, despite elimination of Argatroban from the circulation. Thus, Argatroban, relative to heparin, enhances and sustains thrombolysis with rt-PA. It may offer promise as an adjunctive agent for thrombolytic therapy of arterial thrombosis. 
The use of color flow mapping for intraoperative assessment of valve repair. Repair procedures that preserve a patient's native valve are associated with a lower perioperative and late mortality, a lower incidence of thromboembolic events, and better preservation of left ventricular function than prosthetic replacement. Traditionally employed procedures for intraoperative assessment of the adequacy of repair, such as fluid injection into the arrested ventricle for assessment of valve leakage, measurement of atrial pressure and height of V-waves, and palpation of the atria for the presence of systolic thrills, have not proved to be reliable approaches in the intraoperative evaluation of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and in the assessment of the adequacy of repair procedures. Intraoperative color Doppler, using either the epicardial or the transesophageal approach, offers rapid and accurate information about the presence and severity of mitral regurgitation at the time of surgery. This technique provides instantaneous evaluation of the adequacy of mitral and tricuspid valvuloplasty and appears capable of predicting postoperative outcome. Intraoperative color Doppler is useful for evaluation of the adequacy of repair before chest closure and may thus help to avoid the need for reoperation. This approach may ultimately allow valve repair procedures to be performed in greater numbers of patients with better control over outcome and with lower reoperation rates. 
Histological diagnosis of intestinal microsporidiosis in patients with AIDS. Fifty nine patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and diarrhoea and 20 with weight loss were investigated for microsporidiosis using light and electron microscopical examination of duodenal and jejunal biopsy specimens. Eight cases of microsporidiosis were found, in five of whom it was the sole pathogen. In all eight cases the organism was identified at light microscopy without prior knowledge of the electron microscopical findings. All stages of the life cycle are best seen in resin sections cut at 1 micron and stained with Giemsa, but spores could easily be identified in paraffin sections cut at 5 microns and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. In all cases the parasite was identified both in duodenal pinch and jejunal "Crosby" capsule biopsy specimens. All cases of microsporidiosis occurred in patients with diarrhoea. Both electron and light microscopical examination suggested that the pathogenic mechanism involves the shedding of infected enterocytes containing large numbers of spores. It is suggested that the optimal way to diagnose microsporidiosis is by light microscopical examination of duodenal pinch biopsy specimens. 
Spontaneous haematomyelia: a necropsy study. Spontaneous haematomyelia (intramedullary spinal haematoma), is an uncommon event. Predisposing conditions have been reported including syringomyelia, pregnancy and delivery, angioma, spinal artery aneurysm, and haemophilia, but only rarely has a pathological evaluation been performed. Two such cases studied at necropsy are reported. In one case, the haematoma was restricted to the cervical spinal cord, while in the second case it extended from the medulla into the lowest thoracic cord segments. In both cases the haematomyelia was fatal. In the first case the clinical course was subacute, but in the other the course was more acute. Careful neuropathological examination showed no apparent cause for the haemorrhages. 
Fluid distribution and pulmonary dysfunction following burn shock. Respiratory function and body fluid changes were measured in 46 burned patients for up to 7 days postburn (DPB). The patients in this prospective study were divided into an HLS group [n = 17, burn size 61 +/- 0.5% BSA (mean +/- SEM), resuscitated with hypertonic lactated saline] and an iso-Na group (n = 29, burn size 60 +/- 4.5% BSA, resuscitated with lactated Ringer's solution). During DPB 3 to 5, the Respiratory Index (A-aDO2/PaO2), functional extracellular fluid volume (f-ECFV), an ratio of plasma volume to interstitial fluid volume (PV/ISFV) were increased in the iso-Na group compared with the HLS group. During the same period, the Respiratory Index and PV/ISFV correlated significantly; respiratory dysfunction was less in the HLS group. Nearly 50% of the iso-Na group required endotracheal intubation. Sodium loads were the same in both groups; the HLS group required less water. These results suggest that extracellular fluid distribution differs between the two treatments; HLS may be associated with ameliorated respiratory function not only because of less volume loading during resuscitation, but also because the PV/ISFV ratio is less than when lactated Ringer's is administered. 
Carotid baroreceptor function in dogs with chronic norepinephrine infusion. Carotid baroreceptor function, the compliance of the carotid sinus wall, and the structure of the carotid artery were examined in dogs with elevated plasma norepinephrine (2,000-4,000 pg/ml) for 28 days. The dogs with high norepinephrine were normotensive (100 +/- 4.0 versus 98 +/- 4.0 mm Hg; p greater than 0.05) with bradycardia (65 +/- 4.0 versus 87 +/- 16 beats/min; p less than 0.05) compared with normal dogs in the conscious state. However, after pentobarbital anesthesia blood pressure was significantly higher in dogs with chronic norepinephrine infusion (165 +/- 6 mm Hg) compared with normal dogs (132 +/- 6 mm Hg). To assess baroreceptor sensitivity, multiunit carotid baroreceptor activity was recorded from the right carotid sinus nerve, and the carotid sinus wall compliance (sonomicrometers) was measured during nitroglycerin and phenylephrine injections. The threshold and saturation pressures increased from 96 +/- 3.9 to 117 +/- 4.2 mm Hg and from 145 +/- 4.3 to 171 +/- 5.7 mm Hg, respectively, in the normal dogs compared with the high norepinephrine dogs. The most striking differences were the marked increases in sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors (0.47 +/- 0.05 versus 1.99 +/- 0.45 spikes.sec-1.mm Hg-1; p less than 0.01) and maximum firing frequency of the baroreceptors (24 +/- 3.1 versus 48 +/- 4.4 spikes/sec; p less than 0.01), whereas the carotid sinus wall compliance was unchanged (0.014 +/- 0.003 versus 0.012 +/- 0.002 mm/mm Hg; p greater than 0.05). Similar alterations were observed using single fiber recordings, that is, an increase in threshold and saturation pressures and slope of baroreceptor units in dogs with elevated norepinephrine. The wall thickness and area of the carotid artery were determined. Both increased significantly (0.77 +/- 0.06 versus 1.30 +/- 0.12 mm and 9.0 +/- 0.8 versus 11.9 +/- 0.9 mm2; p less than 0.05) in dogs chronically infused with norepinephrine while the dry weight-to-wet weight ratio of left carotid artery tissue also increased from 26.0 +/- 0.73% to 29.0 +/- 0.57%. These studies indicate that 1) one of the possible mechanisms responsible for bradycardia in the conscious dogs with high norepinephrine is enhanced sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors; 2) the enhanced sensitivity of carotid baroreceptors is not due to a change in compliance of the carotid sinus wall; and 3) chronic elevation of norepinephrine causes hypertrophy or hyperplasia of the wall of the common carotid artery. 
A unique mutation in the vitamin D receptor gene in three Japanese patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type II: utility of single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis for heterozygous carrier detection. Vitamin D-dependent rickets type II is a hereditary disease resulting from a defective vitamin D receptor. In three Japanese patients with vitamin D-dependent rickets type II whose fibroblasts displayed normal cytosol binding and impaired nuclear uptake of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, western, Southern, and northern analyses failed to disclose any abnormalities in vitamin D3 receptor protein and its gene. Exons 2 and 3 of the vitamin D receptor cDNA, which encode the DNA-binding domain consisting of two zinc fingers, were amplified by PCR and sequenced to identify the specific mutations in the vitamin D receptor gene. In the three patients and one normal control a T-to-C transition was found in the putative initiation codon, while this transition was not observed in another normal control. This finding suggested that an original initiation codon was located at positions 10-12 in the human vitamin D receptor cDNA sequence reported previously. In contrast, a unique G-to-A transition at position 140 in exon 3, resulting in substitution of arginine by glutamine at residue 47, was revealed only in these three patients. The arginine at 47 is located between two zinc fingers and is conserved within all steroid hormone receptors. Therefore, it is highly conceivable that this amino acid substitution is responsible for the defect of the vitamin D receptor in the patients. Single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis of amplified DNA confirmed that all patients were homozygous and that parents from one family were heterozygous carriers for this mutation. 
Patients admitted to the emergency room with symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction. All 7157 patients (55% men) admitted to the emergency room with chest pain or other symptoms indicative of acute myocardial infarction during a period of 21 months were registered consecutively. Chest pain was reported by 93% of the patients. On the basis of history, clinical examination, and electrocardiogram in the emergency room, all patients were prospectively classified in one of four categories: (i) obvious infarction (4% of all patients); (ii) strongly suspected infarction (20%); (iii) vague suspicion of infarction (35%); and (iv) no suspected infarction (41%). In patients with no suspected infarction (n = 2910), musculoskeletal (26%), obscure (21%) and psychogenic origins (16%) of the symptoms occurred most frequently. We conclude that few of the patients had an obvious infarction on admission, and that a musculoskeletal origin of the symptoms occurred most frequently in patients with no suspected infarction. 
Maintenance therapy with sucralfate in duodenal ulcer: genuine prevention or accelerated healing of ulcer recurrence? We sought to compare the efficacy of sucralfate to placebo for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence and to determine that the efficacy of sucralfate was due to a true reduction in ulcer prevalence and not due to secondary effects such as analgesic activity or accelerated healing. This was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel groups, multicenter clinical study with 254 patients. All patients had a past history of at least two duodenal ulcers with at least one ulcer diagnosed by endoscopic examination 3 months or less before the start of the study. Complete ulcer healing without erosions was required to enter the study. Sucralfate or placebo were dosed as a 1-g tablet twice a day for 4 months, or until ulcer recurrence. Endoscopic examinations once a month and when symptoms developed determined the presence or absence of duodenal ulcers. If a patient developed an ulcer between monthly scheduled visits, the patient was dosed with a 1-g sucralfate tablet twice a day until the next scheduled visit. Statistical analyses of the results determined the efficacy of sucralfate compared with placebo for preventing duodenal ulcer recurrence. Comparisons of therapeutic agents for preventing duodenal ulcers have usually been made by testing for statistical differences in the cumulative rates for all ulcers developed during a follow-up period, regardless of the time of detection. Statistical experts at the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and on the FDA Advisory Panel expressed doubts about clinical study results based on this type of analysis. They suggested three possible mechanisms for reducing the number of observed ulcers: (a) analgesic effects, (b) accelerated healing, and (c) true ulcer prevention. Traditional ulcer analysis could miss recurring ulcers due to an analgesic effect or accelerated healing. Point-prevalence analysis could miss recurring ulcers due to accelerated healing between endoscopic examinations. Maximum ulcer analyses, a novel statistical method, eliminated analgesic effects by regularly scheduled endoscopies and accelerated healing of recurring ulcers by frequent endoscopies and an open-label phase. Maximum ulcer analysis reflects true ulcer recurrence and prevention. Sucralfate was significantly superior to placebo in reducing ulcer prevalence by all analyses. Significance (p less than 0.05) was found at months 3 and 4 for all analyses. All months were significant in the traditional analysis, months 2-4 in point-prevalence analysis, and months 3-4 in the maximal ulcer prevalence analysis. Sucralfate was shown to be effective for the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence by a true reduction in new ulcer development. 
Predicting the outcomes of electrophysiologic studies of patients with unexplained syncope: preliminary validation of a derived model. PURPOSE: To develop and validate a predictive model that would allow clinicians to determine whether an electrophysiologic (EP) study is likely to result in useful diagnostic information for a patient who has unexplained syncope. PATIENTS: One hundred seventy-nine consecutive patients with unexplained syncope who underwent EP studies at two university medical centers comprised the training sample. A test sample to validate the model was made up of 138 patients from the clinical literature who had undergone EP studies for syncope. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients undergoing EP studies for syncope. The data collector was blinded to the study hypothesis; the electrophysiologist assessing outcomes was blinded to clinical and historical data. Clinical predictor variables available from the history, the physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), and Holter monitoring were analyzed via two multivariable predictive modeling strategies (ordinal logistic regression and recursive partitioning) for their abilities to predict the results of EP studies, namely tachyarrhythmic and bradyarrhythmic outcomes. These categories were further divided into full arrhythmia and borderline arrhythmia groups. RESULTS: Important outcomes were 1) sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and 2) bradyarrhythmias, including sinus node and atrioventricular (AV) conducting disease. The results of the logistic regression (in this study, the superior strategy) showed that the presence of organic heart disease [odds ratio (OR) = 3.0, p less than 0.001] and frequent premature ventricular contractions on ECG (OR = 6.7, p less than 0.004) were associated with VT, while the following abnormal ECG findings were associated with bradyarrhythmias: first-degree heart block (OR = 7.9, p less than 0.001), bundle-branch block (OR = 3.0, p less than 0.02), and sinus bradycardia (OR = 3.5, p less than 0.03). Eighty-seven percent of the 31 patients with important outcomes at EP study had at least one of these clinical risk factors, while 95% of the patients with none of these risk factors had normal or nondiagnostic EP studies. In the validation sample, the presence of one or more risk factors would have correctly identified 88% of the test VT patients and 65% of the test bradyarrhythmia patients as needing EP study. CONCLUSION: These five identified predictive factors, available from the history, the physical examination, and the initial ECG, could be useful to clinicians in selecting those patients with unexplained syncope who will have a serious arrhythmia identified by EP studies. 
Early abdominal complications following heart and heart-lung transplantation. In the first 11 years of the heart and heart-lung transplantation programme at Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, 356 patients underwent heart transplantation, and 73 patients received both heart and lungs. Out of 429 patients 41 (9.5 per cent) developed abdominal complications within the first 30 days, and 20 of the 41 required surgery. The complications included pancreatitis (10), peptic ulceration (8), and pseudo-obstruction (8), in addition to colonic perforation and small bowel obstruction. When laparotomy was performed it was well tolerated. This paper supports the view that successful management of abdominal complications following transplantation requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Where doubt exists in the presence of an acute abdomen, laparotomy is the appropriate way to establish a definitive diagnosis. 
Treatment failure of genital condylomata acuminata in women: role of the male sexual partner. The male sexual partners of women with genital condylomata acuminata are thought to be carriers of human papillomaviruses. It is therefore often recommended that both sexual partners be treated. We studied 360 women with genital warts to test the hypothesis that when the male partners of women with condylomata acuminata are treated, the treatment failure rate decreases. The male sexual partners of 180 of these women were examined and, if indicated, treated (treatment group). The 180 remaining male sexual partners were neither examined nor treated (control group). One hundred twenty-two (68%) men in the treatment group had human papillomavirus-associated lesions. The treatment failure rate of women was 16.7% in the treatment group and 18.9% in the control group. The difference is not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that the treatment failure rate of women with condylomata acuminata decreases if their male sexual partners are also treated. 
Thoracic epidural analgesia in a patient with bilateral phaeochromocytoma undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. A patient suffering from phaeochromocytoma and coronary artery stenoses needed coronary artery bypass grafting before adrenalectomy. High thoracic epidural analgesia (T1-T2) with bupivacaine and sufentanil in combination with general anaesthesia was used. Plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations decreased during the period before bypass grafting compared to the baseline value and no important haemodynamic changes were seen during this period. Thoracic epidural analgesia failed to suppress the release of catecholamine during the bypass period. After the operation, the plasma catecholamine concentrations returned to the baseline value. Excellent analgesia (visual analogue scale = 1-2) was achieved with a postoperative epidural, but the plasma catecholamine concentration increased considerably. 
Encephalo-myelo-radiculo-ganglionitis presenting as pandysautonomia. A 68-year-old man developed pandysautonomia with severe orthostatic dysfunction, fixed heart rate, low serum levels of norepinephrine and epinephrine, absent sympathetic skin responses, and pupillary abnormalities. CSF protein was 92 mg/dl. In spite of a good recovery following corticosteroid administration, a relapse occurred, with accompanying sensory symptoms confined to both arms. Fatal sudden cardiac arrest occurred after 4 months. Autopsy revealed numerous lymphocytic infiltrates, predominantly in autonomic and sensory ganglia and, to a lesser extent, in the nerve roots, spinal cord, and brainstem without evidence for an underlying tumor. This case provides histopathologic evidence for an inflammatory etiology of panautonomic neuropathy in some patients. 
Value of serum alkaline phosphatase and radionuclide bone scans in patients with renal cell carcinoma. Ninety-one patients who underwent radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were reviewed to determine the prognostic value of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) levels and radionuclide bone scan. A preoperative SAP greater than 127 IU/L was a strong indicator of eventual disease progression or death, and an elevated SAP was a better predictor of eventual outcome than bone scan. 
Poikilothermia in man: pathophysiology and clinical implications. Poikilothermia, the inability to maintain a constant core temperature independent of ambient temperature, markedly influences both the mental and physical function of affected patients; furthermore, prolonged hypothermia can induce numerous complications. To establish the pathophysiology of thermoregulation underlying poikilothermia in man, we compared 4 women with acquired poikilothermia, with 9 female control subjects. The activity of the main thermoregulatory effector mechanisms was assessed in a thermoneutral environment, and during subsequent cold stress and heat exposure. At thermoneutrality the patients had a significantly lower rectal temperature and resting metabolic rate compared with the controls; no patient showed peripheral vasoconstriction or shivering. Cooling revealed markedly reduced peripheral vasoconstriction in 3 patients and failure of the metabolic response in 2 patients; unlike controls, no patient exhibited shivering. Heat challenge revealed severely reduced capacity for heat dissipation in all patients. We conclude that in patients with poikilothermia, the mechanisms for both heat conservation and heat dissipation are seriously attenuated. Careful monitoring of the core temperature and adequate measures to maintain normothermia are of great importance in patients with poikilothermia in order to provide adequate treatment, improve the quality of life, and prevent serious complications. 
Second radical neck dissection. We report a series of 96 patients (62 men and 34 women) undergoing a second radical neck dissection for enlarged contralateral cervical nodes after primary treatment of a squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, including an ipsilateral radical neck dissection. The proportion of patients requiring a second later neck dissection varied from 0% for tumours of the nasopharynx, nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, to 5% for tumours of the hypopharynx. The incidence of second neck dissection was not determined by the original T stage of the primary tumour, but patients with enlarged nodes at presentation were 5 times more likely to need a second neck dissection than those with no palpable nodes at presentation. Also, patients with a poorly differentiated tumour were twice as likely to need a second neck dissection as those with a well differentiated tumour. The overall 5-year survival after second neck dissection was 35% and the perioperative mortality 1.92%. Significant factors predicting survival after a second neck dissection were the time to recurrence, the clinical neck node status at recurrence, the number of histologically invaded nodes in the neck and the presence of extra-nodal disease. 
Temporal arteritis: an atypical presentation. Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is a systemic granulomatous vasculitis primarily involving branches of the carotid arteries in patients aged 50 years and greater. Its classic symptoms and signs are headache and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but this is not the only presentation. This case is the first reported in a Korean, whose chief complaint was pain in the tongue and headaches and whose ESR was normal. The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. Her symptoms abated when treated with prednisone, but she developed diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and compression fracture of lumbar vertebrae while being treated. Primary physicians should become aware of the atypical features of this disease, as well as the potential complications of treatment. 
Coronary bypass surgery improves global and regional left ventricular function following thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. TAMI Study Group. Coronary bypass surgery was performed prior to hospital discharge in 303 (22%) of 1387 consecutive patients enrolled in the TAMI 1 to 3 and 5 trials of intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. Bypass surgery was of emergency nature (less than 24 hours from treatment with intravenous thrombolytic therapy) in 36 (2.6%) and was deferred (greater than 24 hours) in 267 (19.3%) patients. The indications for bypass surgery included failed angioplasty (12%); left main or equivalent coronary disease (9%); complex or multivessel coronary disease (62%); recurrent postinfarction angina (13%); and refractory pump dysfunction, mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal rupture or abnormal predischarge functional test (1% each). Although patients having bypass surgery were older (59.5 +/- 9.8 versus 56.0 +/- 10.2 years, (p less than 0.0001), had more extensive coronary artery disease (46% with three-vessel disease versus 11%, (p less than 0.0001), had more frequent diabetes mellitus (19% versus 15%, (p = 0.048), had more prior infarctions (p less than 0.0001), had more severe initial depression in global left ventricular ejection fraction (48.0 +/- 11.9% versus 51.8 +/- 11.9%, p = 0.0002), and regional infarct zone (-2.7 +/- 0.94 versus -2.5 +/- 1.1 SD/chord, p = 0.02) and noninfarct zone function (-0.36 +/- 1.8 versus 0.43 +/- 1.6 SD/chord, p less than 0.0001) than patients not having coronary bypass surgery, no difference in the incidence of death in hospital (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) or death at long-term follow-up of hospital survivors (7% surgical versus 6% nonsurgical) was noted between groups. Surgical patients demonstrated a greater degree of recovery in left ventricular ejection fraction (3.4 +/- 9.8% versus 0.16 +/- 8.5%, p = 0.036) and infarct zone regional function (0.71 +/- 1.1 versus 0.34 +/- 0.99 SD/chord, p = 0.001) when immediate (90 minutes following initiation of thrombolytic therapy) and predischarge (7 to 14 days after treatment) contrast left ventriculograms were compared than did patients who received only intravenous thrombolytic therapy with or without coronary angioplasty. These data suggest a beneficial influence of coronary bypass surgery on left ventricular function and possibly on the clinical outcome of patients initially treated with intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. 
The endocrine effects of long-term treatment with mifepristone (RU 486). Mifepristone (RU 486) is a compound with progesterone as well as cortisol-blocking activities. We investigated the endocrine effects of long-term therapy of 10 patients with meningiomas with 200 mg mifepristone daily for 1 yr. Most patients initially complained of nausea, vomiting, and/or tiredness. In four patients prednisone (7.5 mg/day) had to be given simultaneously in order to overcome these side-effects. In retrospect those patients who presented with the most severe side-effects showed the most rapidly occurring activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis, as measured by an increase of circulating cortisol levels as well as of urinary cortisol excretion. Therapy with RU 486 activated the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in a resetting of this system at a higher level at which the diurnal rhythm and the responsiveness to CRH stimulation were maintained, whereas the sensitivity to dexamethasone had diminished. Secondarily the production of androstenedione and estradiol increased considerably. These endocrine changes were caused by the induction of partial cortisol receptor resistance during therapy with RU 486. The compensatory overproduction of androgens and consequently of estrogens during long-term RU 486 therapy might limit its use as a single treatment in the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancer. 
Septic shock and multiple organ failure. OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency and mortality rates of septic shock in ICU patients and the clinical course of multiple organ failure associated with septic shock. DESIGN: Retrospective case survey. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: During a 2-yr period, 2,469 consecutive intensive care patients were studied regarding the frequency and hospital mortality rates of septic shock. A subset of 1,311 patients was further analyzed for the occurrence of organ system failures within 48 hrs of the onset of septic shock and again 4 to 7 days later. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The frequency rate of septic shock was 1.9% (n = 48), with a mortality rate of 72.9% (n = 35) in patients with septic shock. Deaths due to septic shock represented 14.6% of all deaths in the ICU during the study period. Eighteen patients died within 72 hrs of the onset of septic shock. Refractory hypotension was the cause of death in 15 of these 18 patients. Beyond 72 hrs, multiple organ failure accounted for eight of 17 deaths. The mean +/- SD number of organ systems failing at 48 hrs was 3.3 +/- 1.3 in survivors and 4.0 +/- 1.1 in nonsurvivors, and at 4 to 7 days was 2.1 +/- 1.5 in survivors and 4.0 +/- 1.5 in nonsurvivors (p less than .05). None of the specific organ system failures had prognostic value. The number of organ system failures was not related to the duration of hypotension, but had a weak correlation (r2 = .26, p less than .05) with the duration of vasoactive treatment at 4 to 7 days. The prolonged need for norepinephrine therapy was associated with an increased occurrence of renal failure. Thirty (62.5%) patients had positive blood cultures and a mortality rate similar to the mortality rate of patients with negative blood cultures. Patients with negative blood cultures died more often with hypotension (p less than .02). CONCLUSIONS: Septic shock is a major cause of death in intensive care patients. Refractory hypotension is a main cause of early deaths. Later on, multiple organ failure becomes the primary clinical problem and cause of mortality. 
Duplex ultrasound in the assessment of vascular disease in clinical hypertension. Duplex ultrasound combines B-mode imaging and pulsed Doppler flow analysis and is rapidly becoming the most useful and widely applied method for the evaluation of atherosclerotic arterial disease. Recent technical improvements including color flow Doppler allow its application to practically all vascular beds in the body. Duplex is noninvasive and in many areas its accuracy in the detection of arterial stenosis and occlusion rivals angiography. Duplex ultrasound has become the preferred method of evaluation of patients with cerebrovascular disease. It provides information about the degree of stenosis, location of disease, and plaque characterization, and in many cases replaces standard cerebral arteriography. Duplex ultrasound has been used to detect renal artery stenosis in patients suspected of having renovascular hypertension with an accuracy of 93% in the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant stenosis. It also has important applications in the assessment of mesenteric artery stenosis, peripheral vascular disease, and venous disease. Because it is accurate, reasonably inexpensive, and noninvasive, duplex ultrasound can be used to follow the progression of untreated atherosclerotic lesions throughout the body. Used in this fashion, it provides important information about the natural history of atherosclerotic lesions, their clinical prognosis, and the effect of interventions, either medical or surgical, on lesions. 
Granulocytic sarcoma of the ovary. An unusual case presentation. We report an unusual occurrence of granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an ovarian mass in a 46-year-old woman with a history of dysplastic nevus syndrome. During workup of the ovarian mass, the diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia was made. A fine-needle aspirate of the ovarian mass showed granulocytic sarcoma. The patient died of complications of the acute leukemia a short time later. A postmortem examination was performed, which confirmed the nature of the ovarian mass as a granulocytic sarcoma. Material was obtained for flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and histochemical studies, and electron microscopy. Ploidy analysis of the tumor showed it to be diploid with an S phase of 4.8% and a G2 + M ratio of 0.5%. To our knowledge, there is only one previous report of a primary ovarian presentation of granulocytic sarcoma, and only four cases in which granulocytic sarcoma was diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology. The association between dysplastic nevus syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in this case is discussed with reference to a review of the metachronous association between melanoma and leukemia as described in the literature. 
Antigen-provoked increase in histamine reactivity. Observations on mechanisms. To investigate the effect of antigen provocation on nonspecific reactivity to histamine, nine allergic individuals underwent multiple nasal challenges with histamine, or antigen. The response to challenge was assessed by counting the number of sneezes and measuring the levels of albumin and TAME-esterase (TAME; [3H]N-alpha-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester) activity in recovered nasal lavages. In the case of antigen, levels of histamine were also measured. In response to histamine, the subjects sneezed and had increased levels of albumin and TAME. The responses to antigen or histamine were unchanged 24 h after histamine provocation. The responses to histamine provocations were increased with respect to symptom scores and to the levels of TAME activity and albumin in nasal lavages compared to baseline challenge, however, 24 h after antigen provocation. Increasing antigen exposure from 1 to 3 days did not further increase the responsiveness to histamine. Histamine reactivity returned to baseline 12 days after antigen exposure. The number of eosinophils, neutrophils, and alcian blue-positive cells in the lavages after antigen challenge and before the histamine challenges correlated with the changes in response to histamine. The increase in sneezing induced by antigen stimulation correlated with the increase in the same parameter after histamine provocation 24 hr after antigen challenge (r = 0.88; p less than 0.01). Surprisingly, the other parameters assessed did not show similar correlations. 
Capnography for detection of endobronchial migration of an endotracheal tube. A patient is described in whom migration of an endotracheal tube into the right main bronchus was suspected when end-tidal carbon dioxide suddenly decreased from 28 to 22 mm Hg. Acute changes with migration of the endotracheal tube into the main bronchus were also studied in an animal experimental model. End-tidal carbon dioxide decreased and tracheal (inflation) pressure increased, with no change in tidal volume. Arterial blood gases showed time-dependent decreases in pH and oxygen tension and an increase in carbon dioxide tension. 
Treatment of migraine attacks with sumatriptan. The Subcutaneous Sumatriptan International Study Group BACKGROUND. The headache in migraine attacks may be caused by dilatation of certain cranial arteries or arteriovenous anastomoses, by neurogenic dural plasma extravasation, or by both of these mechanisms. Sumatriptan, a novel selective agonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine-like receptors, blocks these phenomena. We investigated its efficacy in migraine. METHODS. We studied 639 patients with migraine attacks in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. We assessed the effect of subcutaneous injections of 6 or 8 mg of sumatriptan or placebo on the severity of headache and associated migrane symptoms 30, 60, and 120 minutes after treatment. Patients who were not free of pain after 60 minutes subsequently received placebo if they had initially received placebo or 8 mg of sumatriptan, and 6 mg of sumatriptan or placebo if they had initially received 6 mg of sumatriptan. RESULTS. After 60 minutes, the severity of headache was decreased in 72 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 68 to 76 percent) of the 422 patients given 6 mg of sumatriptan, 79 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 71 to 87 percent) of the 109 patients given 8 mg of sumatriptan, and 25 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 17 to 33 percent) of the 105 patients given placebo (data on 3 patients could not be evaluated). As compared with the placebo group, 47 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 38 to 57 percent) more patients who had received 6 mg of sumatriptan and 54 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 43 to 65 percent) more patients who had received 8 mg of sumatriptan had a decrease in the severity of headache (P less than 0.001 for both comparisons). After 120 minutes, 86 to 92 percent of the 511 patients treated with sumatriptan (202 assigned to 6 mg plus placebo, 203 to 6 mg plus 6 mg, and 106 to 8 mg plus placebo) had improvement in the severity of headache, as compared with only 37 percent of the 104 patients who received placebo once or twice (P less than 0.001 for all comparisons). Twenty-one patients were excluded from the analysis because of missing data (19) or protocol violations (2). The response rates did not differ significantly among the sumatriptan regimens. Adverse events were minor and transient in all groups. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that a single 6-mg dose of sumatriptan given subcutaneously is a highly effective, rapid-acting, and well-tolerated treatment for migrane attacks. The administration of a second dose 60 minutes later to patients not responding well to an initial dose affords little additional benefit. 
Evaluation of neck lymph node dissection for thoracic esophageal carcinoma We studied a series of 150 patients treated for thoracic esophageal carcinoma at our institution. The patients were divided into two matched groups. Group B underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenectomy only; group A also underwent bilateral neck lymph node dissection. The rates of operative mortality and operative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. The 5-year survival rate was 38.7% overall (48.7% in group A and 33.7% in group B). Group A had a significantly better survival curve than group B. Twenty patients (26.0%) in group A had metastasis in the dissected neck lymph nodes. The 4-year survival rate of these patients was 47.9%. The significantly better survival of group A and the satisfactory prognosis in the patients with positive cervical lymph nodes demonstrates the effectiveness of neck lymph node dissection in radical operation for thoracic esophageal carcinoma. 
Helicobacter pylori infection in intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinomas [published erratum appears in J Natl Cancer Inst 1991 Jun 19;83(12):881] Gastric cancer can be divided into two histologic types: intestinal and diffuse. To determine whether Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium linked with gastritis, was associated with either cancer type, we reviewed histologic sections from stomachs of patients who had undergone gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Of 37 of the sections with evidence of intestinal-type cancer, 33 (89.2%) contained H pylori in noncancerous tissue compared with 7 (31.8%) of 22 of the sections with evidence of diffuse-type cancer (odds ratio = 17.7; P less than .001). This association remained strong when controlled for age, sex, site, and number of sections reviewed. The prevalence of H pylori in intestinal-type gastric cancer far exceeded the prevalence of H pylori in diffuse disease and that described in the normal US population. This finding suggests that H pylori may be a cofactor in development of intestinal-type gastric cancer. 
Coronary angioplasty in single-vessel complex lesions: short- and long-term outcome and factors predicting acute coronary occlusion. Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of complex coronary lesions (plaque ulceration and/or thrombus) has an increased risk of procedural complications. To assess the influence of these angiographic features on immediate and long-term results of PTCA, we prospectively compared the success rate, incidence of procedural complications, and restenosis rate in two groups of patients selected on the basis of the presence (study group = 30 patients) or absence (control group = 200 patients) of complex morphology at the time of angioplasty. The two groups were similar with regard to extent of coronary artery disease and site of coronary stenosis. Patients in the study group had a higher incidence of periprocedural acute coronary occlusion (47% vs 6%; p less than 0.01), which in 78% of the cases was successfully treated with repeat angioplasty and intracoronary thrombolysis. Univariate correlates of this complication were Canadian Cardiovascular Society class IV (57% vs 19%; p less than 0.05) and recent (less than 30 days) onset of worsening of symptoms (71% vs 31%; p less than 0.05). The incidence of acute myocardial infarction was slightly higher in the study group (6.7% vs 2%; p = NS), and the success rate with redilatation was the same (90%). Clinical and angiographic follow-up data were obtained from all patients in whom the procedure was successful; the restenosis rate was 55% in the study group compared with 36% in the control group (p less than 0.05). 
Characterization of refractory period extension by transcardiac shock. BACKGROUND. To better understand the refractory period extension (RPE) produced by transcardiac shocks and its possible role in defibrillation, we measured RPE under various experimental conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS. Using ventricular pacing in pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs, we characterized RPE in relation to the anatomic site of pacing, the local voltage gradient (LVG) produced by the shocks at the pacing site, and the pacing rate and pacing current used to make the measurements. We also determined if RPE persisted into the next refractory period after the shock and measured RPE at the end of 30-second episodes of acute ischemia to the pacing site, which were caused by occluding the left anterior descending artery. Each anatomic site tested showed RPE, which increased sharply with increasing LVG at lower levels but less sharply at higher LVG. The RPE versus LVG was approximated with an exponential curve that had an exponential constant of about 5-6 V/cm. At faster pacing rates, RPE occurred earlier in the refractory period but was unchanged when expressed as a percent increase of refractory period. RPE did not vary with the pacing current and was present only in the refractory period during which the shock was delivered. The RPE was not significantly altered by acute ischemia. These results show that transcardiac shocks selectively extend the refractory period of tissue proportional to the LVG and the timing of the shock in the refractory period. They are consistent with the concept that RPE prevents depolarization from tissue directly excited by a shock from propagating to tissue that was refractory to that same shock. CONCLUSIONS. The insensitivity of RPE to short ischemic episodes and the presence of RPE at increased activation rates suggest that RPE might exist under conditions of fibrillation and be a major determinant of the success or failure of defibrillation. 
Myocardial calcifications in neonates and infants: a unique tissue reaction. The deposit of calcium salts into myocardial cells represents the process of dystrophic calcification. Once it causes alterations in cellular calcium hemostasis, it can initiate deleterious events leading to ischemic myocardial injury and cell death. Myocardial calcifications in infants are markedly different from those in adults; calcifications are significantly more frequent in cases of myocardial necrosis in the young, and can be demonstrated microscopically without removal of necrotic fibers and scar formation, which are the adult's usual stages of response to myocardial necrosis. Important functional and clinical implications in myocardial calcification, other than serving as a marker for necrosis, relate to accelerated myocardial calcification after cardiac surgery in infants. 
Pubovaginal fascial sling for the treatment of complicated stress urinary incontinence. We reviewed retrospectively 67 consecutive women with complicated stress incontinence who underwent a pubovaginal fascial sling procedure by a single surgeon. A detailed micturition questionnaire was completed at the last followup, which ranged from 1 to 8 years, with a mean of 3.5 years. Postoperatively, 82% of the women claimed that they were never incontinent and never wore pads, while 9% were incontinent less often than once per 2 weeks and 9% 9% continued to have troublesome incontinence on a daily basis. Only 2 of these women had persistent stress incontinence; the remainder (5) had urge incontinence. In 6 patients with a neurogenic bladder postoperative urinary retention was expected and they were treated with intermittent self-catheterization. Two patients had urethral obstruction by the sling and required prolonged (probably permanent) intermittent self-catheterization. 
Cholestasis without cirrhosis alters regulatory liver gene expression and inhibits hepatic regeneration. Partial hepatectomy (PH) initiates cellular signals for regeneration. Sequential expression of nuclear and cytosolic protooncogenes accompanies the restoration of normal liver function and architecture. Although cirrhosis is known to inhibit liver regeneration, the effects of noncirrhotic cholestasis on hepatocellular proliferation, differentiation, and regulatory gene expression are unknown. To examine this, 25 male Fisher rats underwent common bile duct ligation and division. A 47% +/- 5% PH was performed 10 days after common bile duct ligation and division when histologic analysis revealed cholestasis without cirrhosis. Despite early elevations of total hepatic DNA and RNA values, cholestatic livers demonstrated a significant threefold suppression of expected hepatocyte mitotic indexes 48 and 72 hours after PH, compared with livers after PH alone. Weight restoration in cholestatic livers was 11% +/- 5.2% compared with 40% +/- 4.3% in control livers (+/- SEM; p less than 0.001) 5 days after PH. Analysis of regenerating liver messenger RNA with complementary DNA probes revealed an abnormal, sustained elevation of K-ras expression in cholestatic livers through all time points. Cholestasis blunted but did not obliterate normal sequential elevations in H-ras found in control livers. The expression of c-myc was inhibited threefold with cholestasis 72 hours after PH. These results are the first indication that cholestasis alone inhibits hepatocyte proliferation and the expression of c-myc that normally precedes the first wave of mitosis. This implies that cholestasis without cirrhosis may alter programmed liver gene expression, inhibiting normal hepatic regeneration. 
Metastatic melanoma to the heart presenting with ventricular tachycardia. Intraventricular tumors in adults are uncommon, and the association of these with ventricular tachycardia is even more rare. We report a case of an intracardiac metastatic melanoma in a woman who presented with syncope due to ventricular tachycardia. 
Cardiac biopsy in patients with "primary" atrial fibrillation. Histologic evidence of occult myocardial diseases. Fourteen patients (ten men and four women; mean age, 37 years) with lone atrial fibrillation (AF) (1 to 18 months' duration) were evaluated by thyroid function tests, two-dimensional echocardiography, hemodynamics, coronary angiography, and left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy, because of unresponsiveness to the usual antiarrhythmic therapy. The results of the T3, T4, TSH, and TRH tests were normal in all patients; cardiac valves and ventricular and atrial sizes (left atrium less than 40 mm) were within the normal limits; also normal were LVEDP (less than or equal to 10 mm Hg) and EF (greater than 0.50). Histologic findings were abnormal in all cases, with three patients showing cardiomyopathic changes, three other patients showing active myocarditis (lymphocytic in two and eosinophilic in one), and eight patients with nonspecific necrosis or fibrosis or both. Steroids (prednisone; 50 mg/m2 of body surface area daily) used in addition to antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with eosinophilic and lymphocytic active myocarditis were able to cause reversion to sinus rhythm, while the other patients continued to have AF. This study documents that occult myocardial diseases (myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, and nonspecific necrosis or fibrosis) can underlie "primary" AF. The addition of steroids to antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with refractory AF and histologic evidence of active myocarditis seems to be useful in controlling the arrhythmia. 
Results of multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in persons aged 65 years and older. Between 1981 and 1990, 1,373 patients, aged greater than or equal to 65 years (mean 71.2 +/- 4.9), underwent 1,640 multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures. Of these, 224 patients (13.6%) had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%, 412 (25.1%) had prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and 48 (2.9%) had left main artery dilatation. Of the 1,640 PTCA procedures, 697 were in patients with 2-vessel disease and 943 were in patients with 3-vessel disease. A mean 3.5 lesions were dilated per patient, with an overall angiographic success rate of 96%. Complete revascularization was achieved in 857 (52%). A total of 52 patients (3.2%) had a major in-hospital complication: 27 patients (1.6%) died, 24 (1.4%) had a Q-wave myocardial infarction, and 14 (0.8%) underwent emergent CABG. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% (p less than or equal to 0.001), 3-vessel disease (p less than or equal to 0.01), female gender (p less than or equal to 0.02), and PTCA between 1981 and 1985 (p less than or equal to 0.05) as independent predictors of mortality. Of the 1,373 patients, 1,023 have been followed for greater than or equal to 1 year (mean follow-up 32.5 +/- 21.3 months). There were 156 (15.2%) late deaths, 81 (7.9%) recurrent myocardial infarctions, and 162 (15.8%) coronary artery bypass operations. Actuarial survival, computed from the time of hospital discharge, was 92% at 1 year, 86% at 3 years and 78% at 5 years. Repeat PTCA was required in 371 patients (36.3%). 
Multiple swallow test for the quantitative and qualitative evaluation of esophageal motility disorders Esophageal motility was evaluated from the analysis of six consecutive swallows. A sum image was generated comprising the representative information of an entire study. Calculation of emptying rates and characterization of the bolus behavior was performed from the sum image and the single swallow data. In 86 patients investigated, liquid and solid-phase studies showed a remarkable variation of single swallow data in normals (relative variation coefficient for liquid: 10%, solid: 14%), which were even higher (p less than 0.001) in patients with disorders (liquid: 31%, solid: 25%). As sum images compensate for this intra-individual variation, false-positive (liquid: 16%, solid: 25%) or negative single swallow findings (liquid: 36%, solid: 27%) are reduced. Qualitative analysis of condensed sum images provided characteristic image patterns representing different pathophysiologic aspects. Since the method introduced better discriminates between normal and pathologic function, it may enhance diagnostic accuracy. 
Selective versus routine predischarge coronary arteriography after therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator, heparin and aspirin for acute myocardial infarction. TIMI II Investigators. To ascertain whether predischarge arteriography is beneficial in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA), heparin and aspirin, the outcome of 197 patients in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) IIA study assigned to conservative management and routine predischarge coronary arteriography (routine catheterization group) was compared with the outcome of 1,461 patients from the TIMI IIB study assigned to conservative management without routine coronary arteriography unless ischemia recurred spontaneously or on predischarge exercise testing (selective catheterization group). The two groups were similar with regard to important baseline variables. During the initial hospital stay, coronary arteriography was performed in 93.9% of the routine catheterization group and 34.7% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), but the frequency of coronary revascularization (angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery) was similar in the two groups (24.4% versus 20.7%, p = NS). Coronary arteriograms showed a predominance of zero or one vessel disease (stenosis greater than or equal to 60%) in both groups (routine catheterization group 73.1%, selective catheterization group 61.3%). During the 1st year after infarction, rehospitalization for cardiac reasons and the interim performance of coronary arteriography were more common in the selective catheterization group (37.9% versus 27.6%, p = 0.007 and 28.6% versus 11.6%, p less than 0.001, respectively); however, the interim rates of death, nonfatal reinfarction and performance of coronary revascularization procedures were similar. At the end of 1 year, coronary arteriography had been performed one or more times in 98.9% of the routine catheterization group and 59.4% of the selective catheterization group (p less than 0.001), whereas death and nonfatal reinfarction had occurred in 10.2% versus 7.0% (p = 0.10) and 8.6% versus 9.0% (p = 0.87), respectively. Because the selective coronary arteriography policy exposes about 40% fewer patients to the small but finite risks and inconvenience of the procedure without compromising the 1 year survival or reinfarction rates, it seems to be an appropriate management strategy. 
Results of fundoplication in a UK paediatric centre. Of 55 children (age 3 months to 16 years) who had fundoplication, major complications occurred in nine (16 per cent): paraoesophageal hernia (five cases), prolonged ileus (two cases), recurrent gastro-oesophageal reflux (one case), and accidental perforation (one case). The single most important factor resulting in complications was the omission of crural repair; of seven patients without crural repair, five developed paraoesophageal hernia/recurrence. Four patients required repeat fundoplication for severe recurrent symptoms and one of these developed the unusual complication of pericardiogastric fistula. Thirteen patients had strictures before operation from reflux oesophagitis, six (46 per cent) resolved after fundoplication alone, six responded to dilatation (mean five sessions), and one required colon interposition. Our preliminary experience with balloon dilatation was encouraging: three of three patients responded after one dilatation only. These results confirmed the efficacy of surgery in controlling reflux: 100 per cent in the short-term and 89 per cent on a 1-6 year follow-up. Major complications might well be reduced by routine crural repair. 
Magnesium prophylaxis of menstrual migraine: effects on intracellular magnesium. The effects of oral Magnesium (Mg) pyrrolidone carboxylic acid were evaluated in 20 patients affected by menstrual migraine, in a double-blind, placebo controlled study. After a two cycles run-in period, the treatment (360 mg/day of Mg or placebo) started on the 15th day of the cycle and continued till the next menses, for two months. Oral Mg was then supplemented in an open design for the next two months. At the 2nd month, the Pain Total Index was decreased by both Placebo and Mg, with patients receiving active drug showing the lowest values (P less than 0.03). The number of days with headache was reduced only in the patients on active drug. Mg treatment also improved premenstrual complaints, as demonstrated by the significant reduction of Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ) scores. The reduction of PTI and MDQ scores was observed also at the 4th month of treatment, when Mg was supplemented in all the patients. Intracellular Mg++ levels in patients with menstrual migraine were reduced compared to controls. During oral Mg treatment, the Mg++ content of Lymphocytes (LC) and Polymorphonucleated cells (PMN) significantly increased, while no changes in plasma or Red Blood Cells were found. An inverse correlation between PTI and Mg++ content in PMN was demonstrated. These data point to magnesium supplementation as a further means for menstrual migraine prophylaxis, and support the possibility that a lower migraine threshold could be related to magnesium deficiency. 
Malignant transformation of an osteoblastoma of the skull: an exceptional occurrence. Case report. What is apparently the first reported case of spontaneous malignant transformation of a benign osteoblastoma of the skull is described. The initial lesion was completely removed surgically and showed the histological features typical of a benign osteoblastoma. No radiotherapy was performed. Eleven years later the patient developed an osteosarcoma of the skull. Review of the literature showed that malignant transformation of benign osteoblastomas is extremely rare and could take place spontaneously. However, the risk of this occurring seems higher after inadequate initial treatment (curettage or partial excision). Follow-up monitoring of patients with osteoblastoma of the cranial vault is suggested. 
Effects of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure on atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopressin release during sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea. 1. Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea have increased diuresis during sleep, which decreases with nasal continuous positive airway pressure treatment. These changes have been attributed to an increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide in obstructive sleep apnoea, and its decrease with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 2. In order to clarify the change in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide level and to investigate the underlying mechanisms, blood samples were taken at 10 min intervals from nine patients with obstructive sleep apnoea during two nights when the patients were either untreated or treated with continuous positive airway pressure. Polysomnographic monitoring, including transcutaneous oximetry, and measurement of oesophageal pressure were performed simultaneously. Plasma arginine vasopressin was also measured. 3. The plasma level of arginine vasopressin did not change. The level of atrial natriuretic peptide was high and exhibited secretion bursts in six out of the nine patients; it drastically decreased with continuous positive airway pressure treatment. 4. Across the patients, the mean plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide was correlated with the degree of hypoxaemia and the degree of oesophageal pressure swings during the sleep apnoeas. 5. Within the patients, cross-correlation studies suggested that the atrial natriuretic peptide secretory bursts were related either to the oesophageal pressure swings or to the apnoea-related hypoxaemia. 6. We conclude that release of atrial natriuretic peptide decreases with continuous positive airway pressure treatment in those patients with obstructive sleep apnoea who have increased release of atrial natriuretic peptide before treatment. 
Combined therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine in murine cryptococcal meningitis. To assess the possible beneficial effects of combined therapy (fluconazole and flucytosine) in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in the immunocompromised host, we compared therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine, individually and combined, in the experimental murine model. BALB/c athymic (nu/nu) mice were infected intracerebrally with 150 to 300 CFU of Cryptococcus neoformans. In mortality studies, treatment was initiated 24 h postinfection and continued for 10 to 14 days with either fluconazole (1 to 15 mg/kg of body weight per day), flucytosine (60 to 120 mg/kg/8 h), both drugs, or 0.3% Noble agar (control). Combined therapy delayed mortality significantly when compared with controls and single-drug regimens. This was observed over a broad range of doses. Quantitative determinations of CFU in brain tissue demonstrated a significantly lower burden of C. neoformans in mice receiving combined therapy. The results indicate that combined therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine is superior to single-drug therapy. 
Effect of aldose reductase inhibition on resistance to ischemic conduction block in diabetic subjects. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of aldose reductase inhibition with ponalrestat on resistance to ischemic conduction block (RICB) in diabetic subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one healthy diabetic subjects without neuropathy were studied. Subjects were randomized to take either a double-blind trial of 600 mg ponalrestat or placebo once daily for 6 wk. The median nerve action potential (MNAP) and conduction velocity (NCV), before and after 20 min of forearm ischemia, were measured at the start and finish of the study. Results: RICB (MNAP remaining after ischemia) decreased from 39.5 to 29.4% in the ponalrestat-treated group (P less than 0.05) and increased from 48.1 +/- 10.2 to 49.5 +/- 6.5% in the placebo-treated group. MNAP and NCV were unchanged in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Aldose reductase inhibition with ponalrestat partly reverses RICB in diabetes, perhaps by improving nerve hypoxia or reducing nerve energy substrates. 
Intracisternal recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage. Fifteen patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours of aneurysm rupture were administered recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) directly into the basal subarachnoid cisterns after minimal surgical clot removal and aneurysm clipping. Preoperatively, 13 patients had diffuse or localized thick subarachnoid blood clots on computerized tomography (CT), and two had diffuse thin clots. The rt-PA was given as a single intraoperative injection of 7.5 mg (one patient), 10 mg (nine patients), or 15 mg (five patients). Postoperative cisternal drainage was employed in three patients. All patients except one demonstrated partial to complete cisternal clot clearance on CT scans within 24 hours after surgery. The patient who showed no clot reduction was the only patient in this series to develop symptomatic vasospasm and was the only fatality, dying 8 days after rupture. No vasospasm was seen on follow-up cerebral angiography in six of the 14 responding patients, and mild-to-moderate arterial narrowing was seen in at least one major cerebral artery in the remaining eight patients. Severe angiographic vasospasm was not seen, although the patient who died did not undergo repeat angiography. There was one major complication early in the series which seemed clearly related to treatment, and that was a large extradural hematoma occurring within several hours of craniotomy. Intrathecal fibrinolytic treatment appears effective in clearing subarachnoid clot and reducing vasospasm, and may be associated with acceptable risks if given to patients with large-volume subarachnoid hemorrhages at high risk for severe vasospasm. 
Exercise hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism during long-term beta-adrenergic blockade in severe heart failure Hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism at rest and during exercise were investigated in 21 patients with heart failure. The patients were evaluated before and after long-term treatment (14 +/- 7 months) with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol. Clinical improvement with increased functional capacity occurred during treatment. Maximal work load increased by 25% (104 to 130 W; p less than 0.001). Hemodynamic data showed an increased cardiac index (3.8 to 4.6 liters/min per m2; p less than 0.02) during exercise. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased at rest (20 to 13 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and during exercise (32 to 28 mm Hg; p = NS). Stroke volume index (30 to 39 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) and stroke work index (28 to 46 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) increased during exercise and long-term metoprolol treatment. The arterial norepinephrine concentration decreased at rest (3.72 to 2.19 nmol/liter; p less than 0.02) but not during exercise (13.2 to 11.1 nmol/liter; p = NS). The arterial-coronary sinus norepinephrine difference suggested a decrease in myocardial spillover during metoprolol treatment (-0.28 to -0.13 nmol/liter; p = NS at rest and -1.13 to -0.27 nmol/liter; p less than 0.05 during exercise). Coronary sinus blood flow was unchanged during treatment. Four patients produced myocardial lactate before the study, but none produced lactate after beta-blockade (p less than 0.05). There was no obvious improvement in a subgroup of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. In summary, there were signs of increased myocardial work load without higher metabolic costs after treatment with metoprolol. 
Chemotherapy compared with bone marrow transplantation for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission. OBJECTIVE: To compare efficacy of intensive postremission chemotherapy with allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first remission. DESIGN: Retrospective comparison of two cohorts of patients. SETTING: Chemotherapy recipients were treated in 44 hospitals in West Germany in two cooperative group trials; transplants were done in 98 hospitals worldwide. PATIENTS: Patients (484) receiving intensive postremission chemotherapy and 251 recipients of HLA-identical sibling bone marrow transplants for ALL in first remission. Patients ranged from 15 to 45 years of age and were treated between 1980 and 1987. MAIN RESULTS: Similar prognostic factors predicted treatment failure (non-T-cell phenotype, high leukocyte count at diagnosis, and 8 or more weeks to achieve first remission) of both therapies. After statistical adjustments were made for differences in disease characteristics and time-to-treatment, survival was similar in the chemotherapy and transplant cohorts: Five-year leukemia-free survival probability was 38% (95% CI, 33% to 43%) with chemotherapy and 44% (CI, 37% to 52%) with transplant. No specific prognostic group had a significantly better outcome with one treatment compared with the other (6% for the difference; CI, -3% to 15%). Causes of treatment failure differed: With chemotherapy, 268 (96%) failures were from relapse and 11 (4%) were treatment-related; with transplants, 43 (32%) failures were from relapse and 92 (68%) were treatment-related. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that bone marrow transplants currently offer no special advantage over chemotherapy for adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in first remission. 
Relation between malpractice claims and adverse events due to negligence. Results of the Harvard Medical Practice Study III. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. By matching the medical records of a random sample of 31,429 patients hospitalized in New York State in 1984 with statewide data on medical-malpractice claims, we identified patients who had filed claims against physicians and hospitals. These results were then compared with our findings, based on a review of the same medical records, regarding the incidence of injuries to patients caused by medical management (adverse events). RESULTS. We identified 47 malpractice claims among 30,195 patients' records located on our initial visits to the hospitals, and 4 claims among 580 additional records located during follow-up visits. The overall rate of claims per discharge (weighted) was 0.13 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 0.076 to 0.18 percent). Of the 280 patients who had adverse events caused by medical negligence as defined by the study protocol, 8 filed malpractice claims (weighted rate, 1.53 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 3.2 percent). By contrast, our estimate of the statewide ratio of adverse events caused by negligence (27,179) to malpractice claims (3570) is 7.6 to 1. This relative frequency overstates the chances that a negligent adverse event will produce a claim, however, because most of the events for which claims were made in the sample did not meet our definition of adverse events due to negligence. CONCLUSIONS. Medical-malpractice litigation infrequently compensates patients injured by medical negligence and rarely identifies, and holds providers accountable for, substandard care. 
Intermittent pneumatic compression therapy in posttraumatic lower limb edema: computed tomography and clinical measurements. The purpose of our study was to assess the amount of posttraumatic lower limb edema and its distribution between subcutaneous and subfascial compartments before and after intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) therapy in patients with fractures of the lower leg immobilized with a cast for six to 12 weeks. Computed tomography (CT) was used as an objective method of measuring the compartmental distribution of edema. Sixteen patients with a mean age of 37 years (range 19 to 64 years) were investigated by clinical measurement of the leg circumference and by CT at the ankle joint and at three equidistant (10cm) levels above it. The unaffected leg served as a control for the evaluation of the amount of edema and density of the tissues. Edema was found primarily in subcutaneous tissue. The IPC treatment decreased relative edema from 23% to 15.9% (p less than 0.01) as measured by CT, and from 23.5% to 13.2% as measured clinically. The density of muscle tissue increased 9% (p less than 0.01) and that of subcutaneous tissue decreased 5.6% (p less than 0.05). The IPC treatment influenced both the amount of edema and the density of tissue compartments. 
High-dose chemotherapy with reinfusion of purged autologous bone marrow following dose-intense induction as initial therapy for metastatic breast cancer. We assessed the toxicity and efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy consolidation with reinfusion of purged autologous bone marrow in women with metastatic breast cancer responding to a dose-intense outpatient regimen. Thirty women with hormone-unresponsive metastatic breast cancer, previously untreated with adjuvant doxorubicin or with any chemotherapy for metastatic disease, were treated with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, vincristine, and leucovorin for 16 weeks. Twenty-four patients responded to therapy; 8 showed a complete response, and 16 showed a partial response. These patients proceeded to the next phase of the protocol, ie, marrow harvest and treatment with 6000 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide and 800 mg/m2 thiotepa given over 4 days. Harvested marrow was purged with 100 micrograms/mL 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, and all patients engrafted satisfactorily. The predominant side effects were myelosuppressive and gastrointestinal, and there were no deaths from toxic effects. Three of the 16 patients who showed a partial response after the outpatient phase of treatment achieved a complete response after high-dose therapy. The partial response seen in two more patients converted to a complete response at all sites except bone. The median time to disease progression for all patients in this study was 13 months, and the median survival was 22 months. Four of the original 30 patients remained without disease progression a median of 27 months from entry into the study. This study indicates that this dose-intense regimen can be safely administered, even with the use of purged marrow, with an acceptable toxicity profile. This approach results in a high response rate in women with metastatic breast cancer and could form the basis for a regimen to be tested in the high-risk adjuvant setting. 
Warm heart surgery and results of operation for recent myocardial infarction. Revascularization procedures after recent myocardial infarction are associated with higher mortality and morbidity compared with elective coronary artery bypass grafting. Traditional methods of myocardial protection impose a further ischemic insult on already compromised myocardium. Continuous cold blood cardioplegia may eliminate ischemia but may still leave the heart anaerobic. Theoretically, warm aerobic arrest addresses both of these issues and may become an attractive alternative to standard hypothermic ischemic arrest in this setting. In 115 nonrandomized patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting within 6 hours to 7 days of an acute myocardial infarction, myocardial protection was provided with continuous cold (4 degrees C) or continuous warm (37 degrees C) blood cardioplegia. Fifty-one patients (after 1988) protected with warm blood cardioplegia were compared with a historical cohort of 64 patients (before 1988) protected with cold blood cardioplegia. Results indicate that the warm cardioplegia group had no mortality versus 10.9% for the cold group (p less than 0.05), a myocardial infarction rate of 2.0% in the warm versus 9.3% in the cold group, and use of intraaortic balloon pump of 0% versus 12.5%, respectively (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that continuous warm aerobic arrest may minimize ischemia and anaerobic metabolism during the operative procedure, and may be of benefit to patients who have a limited tolerance to ischemic insult. 
Dysrhythmias and blood pressure changes associated with thrombolysis. Recent technologic advances facilitate salvage of viable myocardium before the process of myocardial infarction is complete. The aim of thrombolytic agents is to restore antegrade flow of blood in occluded coronary arteries. The process of reperfusion may be dysrhythmogenic because of the heterogeneous return of electrical activity in myocardial cells. This study examined the incidence and type of dysrhythmia occurrence and the associated changes in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) during infusion of tissue-type plasminogen activator (TPA). A retrospective chart review of 41 subjects showed that 80% of subjects experienced dysrhythmias during TPA therapy. The most common dysrhythmia was sinus bradycardia, followed by idioventricular/accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular premature beats, and ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation. There was a significant difference between MAP changes when there were no dysrhythmias and MAP changes when dysrhythmias occurred (p less than 0.05). The largest change in MAP (-22.71 mm Hg) was observed when dysrhythmias occurred in those subjects with blockage of the left anterior descending artery, although there was no statistically significant difference in changes in MAP among the groups of different sites of blockage (p greater than 0.05). 
Effect of the degree of effort on exercise echocardiography for the detection of restenosis after coronary artery angioplasty. To determine whether the accuracy of exercise echocardiography is affected by the degree of effort during exercise, we examined 101 patients who had 6 months earlier undergone successful coronary artery angioplasty, with resting and immediate postexercise echocardiography and same-day coronary angiography. A positive exercise echocardiographic response was defined as the development of a new or worsening wall motion abnormality postexercise, compared with resting wall motion. Significant coronary disease (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) was present in 48 patients, 38 of whom had single-vessel disease and 10 of whom had two-vessel disease. Exercise echocardiography correctly identified 32 patients with significant disease (sensitivity 67%) and 44 patients without significant disease (specificity 83%). The effect of the degree of exercise effort on the sensitivity and specificity of the test was evaluated by three criteria; (1) the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate (MHR), (2) the duration of exercise (DUR), and (3) the double product (DP). To determine the influence of the degree of effort upon sensitivity and specificity, the effort criteria were compared between patients with true positive (TP) tests to those with false negative tests (FN), and in patients with true negative (TN) tests compared with those with false positive (FP) tests. No significant differences were detected in MHR, DUR, or DP between TP versus FN patients or between TN versus FP patients. These results indicate that for symptom-limited exercise echocardiography in postangioplasty patients, neither sensitivity nor specificity is significantly affected by the degree of effort during exercise. 
Normal pressure hydrocephalus in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe a patient who had concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a normal pressure hydrocephalus. She improved only after appropriate therapy for each. Although 6 patients with arthritis and normal pressure hydrocephalus have been described, this is the first report of it occurring in a patient with SLE. It has been emphasized that normal pressure hydrocephalus can easily be overlooked in elderly patients with arthritic conditions. Since neuropsychiatric symptoms are likelier to occur in patients with SLE than in other rheumatologic conditions, the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus may be delayed or overlooked. Because normal pressure hydrocephalus is a potentially reversible cause of neurologic dysfunction, it should be considered in appropriate populations. 
"Early" initiation of levodopa treatment does not promote the development of motor response fluctuations, dyskinesias, or dementia in Parkinson's disease. We reviewed the histories of patients seen in a large Parkinson's disease clinic from 1983 to 1989 to determine if there is a relationship between the timing of initiation of levodopa therapy and the development of motor response fluctuations, dyskinesias, and dementia. There were no factors predisposing to the development of response fluctuations or dementia. Younger age at disease onset predisposed to the development of dyskinesia. Dyskinesias occurred in a greater proportion of patients in whom the initiation of levodopa therapy was delayed by more than 2 years from disease diagnosis than among those in whom treatment was started earlier. We thus failed to identify any adverse consequences of early levodopa treatment in our patient population. 
A multicenter comparison of the safety and efficacy of isradipine and enalapril in the treatment of hypertension. This multicenter trial compared the efficacy and safety of isradipine and enalapril in 160 patients with essential hypertension. Patients received isradipine or enalapril for 10 weeks after a placebo wash-out period of three to five weeks. Dosage was titrated for six weeks on the basis of blood pressure (BP) response and was then maintained for the remainder of the study. Isradipine reduced systolic and diastolic BP by 12 and 9 mm Hg, respectively, and enalapril by 10 and 7 mm Hg, respectively (between-treatment difference P less than .05 for diastolic BP). Overall, isradipine resulted in a higher responder rate, particularly among patients who had higher entry BPs. Fifteen enalapril-treated patients and four isradipine-treated patients discontinued treatment (four taking enalapril and none taking isradipine withdrew because of lack of efficacy). The most frequently reported adverse reactions were headache, dizziness, and edema in the isradipine group, and cough, headache, and chest pain in the enalapril group. Both drugs produced significant reductions in BP, but, in this study isradipine was more effective. The drugs were similarly well tolerated. 
Linkage of a cardiac arrhythmia, the long QT syndrome, and the Harvey ras-1 gene Genetic factors contribute to heart disease. In this study, linkage analyses have been performed in a family that is predisposed to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias, the long QT syndrome (LQT). A DNA marker at the Harvey ras-1 locus (H-ras-1) was linked to LQT with a logarithm of the likelihood ratio for linkage (lod score) of 16.44 at theta = 0, which confirms the genetic basis of this trait and localizes this gene to the short arm of chromosome 11. As no recombination was observed between LQT and H-ras-1, and there is a physiological rationale for its involvement in this disease, ras becomes a candidate for the disease locus. 
Evidence for hypoxic depression of CO2-ventilation response in carotid body-resected humans. Steady-state CO2-ventilation response curves with hyperoxia (end-tidal PO2 greater than 200 Torr) and mild hypoxia (end-tidal PO2 approximately equal to 60 Torr) were compared in five carotid body-resected (BR) patients and five control patients. The data were analyzed by fitting a linear equation, V = S(PETCO2-B), where V is minute ventilation S is the response curve slope. PETCO2 is end-tidal PCO2, and B is the response curve threshold. S slightly increased from hyperoxia to hypoxia in both BR and control groups. On the other hand, B moderately increased with hypoxia in BR patients, whereas it slightly decreased in controls. These changes were all not significant. However, in accordance with the change in B, the response curve to hypoxia at V of 10 1/min was significantly shifted in opposite directions in the two groups, i.e., rightward and leftward shift in BR and control groups, respectively. Thus the average magnitude of V calculated at PETCO2 of 40 Torr in hypoxia was significantly lower in BR patients than in controls (P less than 0.01). We conclude that this hypoxic depression of the CO2-ventilation response found in BR patients may have resulted, at least in part, from modulation of the brain stem neural mechanisms that were elicited by loss of afferent discharges from the carotid body. 
Spinal cord stimulation in 60 cases of intractable pain. Sixty patients with spinal cord stimulators implanted for intractable pain lasting up to 50 years were followed for up to nine years. Forty seven per cent derived significant benefit, 23% modest benefit, 20% experienced no effect and 6.7% were made worse. Two were made worse after initial benefit. Complications, indications and factors relevant to the mode of action are discussed. 
cis-platinum ototoxicity in children. Cis-platinum is an ototoxic antineoplastic drug. Evaluation of auditory thresholds in 33 children receiving cis-platinum shows that a threshold shift at 6 and 8 kHz is first measurable after a cumulative dose of 201 to 300 mg/m2. A 35- to 40-dB high-frequency threshold shift is evident after a cumulative cis-platinum dose of 301 to 400 mg/m2. Increasing cumulative doses of cis-platinum are associated with a greater degree of hearing loss. Receiver-operator characteristic curves were used to find a criterion value that effectively identified threshold shifts that were due to cis-platinum ototoxicity. A 15-dB or greater shift in the 6- and 8-kHz threshold average identifies a high true-positive (50%) and low false-positive (0%) rate of cis-platinum-induced hearing loss. Using this criterion, cis-platinum ototoxicity affected 77% of children who received cis-platinum (median cumulative dose 360 mg/m2). 
Surveillance for recurrent stenosis after endovascular procedures. A prospective study. Eighty-nine endovascular procedures were performed during a 1-year period. Techniques included balloon angioplasty (n = 50), laser-assisted balloon angioplasty (n = 32), and atherectomy (n = 7). Indications were claudication (65.2%), critical ischemia (30.3%), and failing bypass (4.5%). Preoperative evaluation included a history and physical examination, segmental limb pressures, and color duplex ultrasonography. Postoperative surveillance consisted of a history and physical examination, ankle-arm indexes, and color duplex examinations at 1-week, 1-month, and then 3-month intervals. All levels of aortoiliac and infrainguinal disease were treated. Immediate technical success rate was 89.8%. Recurrence rates by life-table analysis reveal a 9-month patency rate of 45.4%. Early results of this prospective study indicate that endovascular procedures are subject to significant restenosis rates. Restraint is advised concerning general acceptance of endovascular procedures pending critical study. 
Influence of physical exercise on serum digoxin concentration and heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation. Heart rate and serum digoxin concentration in eight patients with atrial fibrillation were studied at rest and during exercise when initial serum digoxin concentrations were zero and at low and high therapeutic values. Eight patients with ischemic heart disease and in sinus rhythm were studied for comparison. Though the serum digoxin concentration decreased significantly during exercise, the absolute reduction in heart rate was the same at rest and during exercise in patients with atrial fibrillation. Compared with the control patients in sinus rhythm, the heart rate in patients with atrial fibrillation was not adequately controlled during exercise by any serum digoxin concentration tested despite a reduction in heart rate with increasing digoxin concentration. The effects of digoxin on heart rate regulation in atrial fibrillation are complex and include direct effects on the myocardium as well as indirect effects mediated by modulation of the autonomic nervous system; the present results indicate that the drug is not displaced from the target organs by decreasing serum concentrations during exercise. In atrial fibrillation, because the demands on the filter function of the atrioventricular node are highly unphysiological, the effect of digoxin on heart rate during exercise is not adequate. 
The role of immunoglobulin in bone marrow transplantation. Bone marrow transplantation has proven its value as a therapeutic approach to a variety of human diseases, primarily the hematopoietic malignancies. The major clinical problems preventing successful outcome of marrow transplant have been defined and therapeutic approaches to preventing or treating these complications have led to increased long-term disease survival. Passively administered antibody given as intravenous immunoglobulin has been studied as a therapeutic modality following bone marrow transplantation. Studies have demonstrated the efficacy of immunoglobulin in reducing bacterial infections in the posttransplant period; reducing severe CMV infections in allogeneic marrow transplant recipients who are seronegative for the virus and susceptible to primary infection; reducing mortality from CMV pneumonia in combination with ganciclovir; and reducing acute graft-versus-host disease following allogeneic BMT. In many cases alternate therapeutic strategies offer comparable or greater efficacy (eg, selective CMV-negative blood products for CMV seronegative allogeneic BMT recipients receiving bone marrow from a seronegative donor). However, it is clear that intravenous immunoglobulin has a place in the therapeutic armamentarium of bone marrow transplantation. Future controlled clinical trials are necessary to establish its exact role and to define which preparations and dose schedules provide the greatest therapeutic benefits. 
Spontaneous release of interferon gamma by intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes in Crohn's disease. Kinetics of in vitro response to interferon gamma inducers. The spontaneous induced release of interferon gamma (IFN gamma) by cultured intestinal lamina propria lymphocytes was investigated in patients with Crohn's disease. In contrast to normal lymphocytes, intestinal lymphocytes from these patients spontaneously released IFN gamma and seemed to contain IFN gamma in their cytoplasm. Autologous peripheral lymphocytes did not release IFN gamma. When stimulated with interferon inducers lamina propria lymphocytes from Crohn's disease tissue showed an increase in IFN gamma release 24 hours after induction with no appreciable further increase over the next two days of culture, while in control cells, either peripheral or intestinal, IFN gamma release progressively increased, peaking 72 hours after induction. These findings indicate that in Crohn's disease the intestinal lymphocytes are stimulated in vivo to produce IFN gamma and that the spontaneous IFN gamma production is compartmentalised to the gut lymphocytes. These data support the concept that locally released IFN gamma has a crucial role in cell interactions in the lamina propria and contribute to the locally occurring immune phenomena in Crohn's disease, including the increased epithelial expression of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens. 
EEG and topographic frequency analysis in common and classic migraine. Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes occurring in patients with migraine have received much attention. However, almost equal number of reports indicate the predominance of normal and abnormal findings. We studied the EEG in symptom-free, otherwise healthy, unmedicated 18-28 year-old patients: 22 with common migraine, 20 with classic migraine, and 20 age-matched controls. The routine EEG findings in the three groups revealed mild non-specific slowing in 2 (9%), 3 (15%) and 2 (10%), respectively. Simultaneously, topographic EEG mapping and frequency analysis were performed in 13 consecutive patients with common migraine, 10 patients with classic migraine and 11 age-matched controls. EEG mapping showed minimal regional differences with lower power in the alpha range in patients with eyes closed. The peak alpha power, as well as its reactivity, were lower among patients than controls. This difference reached statistical significance only for patients with classic migraine versus controls in the left occipital region. Patients also had slightly faster peak alpha frequency. No frank right-left asymmetry was observed in the peak alpha power, neither among the controls, nor the patients. All the findings were rather minor. They may suggest some difference in the posterior background activity in the EEG in migraine patients as compared to the controls, but are not useful in differentiating migraine from non-migraine patients. 
Severe limb abnormalities after chorion villus sampling at 56-66 days' gestation Among 289 pregnancies in which chorion villus sampling (CVS) was carried out at 56-66 days' gestation, 5 babies with severe limb abnormalities were subsequently identified. 4 had oromandibular-limb hypogenesis syndromes, and the other had a terminal transverse limb reduction defect. This high incidence raises the possibility that CVS was an aetiological factor for these developmental anomalies. 
Gold-associated lymphadenopathy in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. Histologic and scanning electron microscopic features. The histologic features of adenopathy associated with intramuscular injections of gold sodium thiomalate in a woman with rheumatoid arthritis are presented. We believe that the light microscopic features of the above process are sufficiently distinctive that a diagnosis of gold-associated lymphadenopathy could be rendered. A review of the literature revealed no descriptions of the light microscopic appearance of gold in lymph nodes. In this case, the diagnosis of gold-associated lymphadenopathy was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic studies. 
Factors influencing admission blood pressure levels in patients with acute stroke. In clinical practice, patients with acute stroke often have high blood pressure. The aim of this study was to investigate factors correlated with blood pressure elevation in 843 consecutive stroke patients on hospital admission to a nonintensive stroke unit. Using a multivariate analysis model, we analyzed the influence on admission blood pressure of sex, age, previous hypertension, cardiac failure, diabetes, type of stroke, impaired consciousness, and latency between onset of symptoms and admission. Previous hypertension was the strongest predictor (p less than 0.001) of elevated blood pressure on admission, followed by the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage (p less than 0.001). The latency between onset of symptoms and admission showed no correlation with blood pressure levels at hospitalization. Previously, high blood pressure levels on hospital admission have been shown to decline within a few days in hospital. We therefore hypothesize that mental stress on hospital admission may be a major factor in the blood pressure elevation seen in acute stroke. 
Congestive heart failure secondary to an arteriovenous fistula from cardiac catheterization and angioplasty. Arteriovenous (AV) fistulae are well known to cause high output cardiac failure. AV fistulae from cardiac catheterization are as rare as 0.01% in the transfemoral approach. We describe here what we believe is the first reported case of high output cardiac failure from an AV fistula due to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The patient had reversal of the congestive heart failure with surgical correction of the fistula. 
Reliability of peak physiological responses during wheelchair ergometry in persons with spinal cord injury. This study examined the test-retest reliability of peak physiological responses during wheelchair ergometry (WE) in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). Seven wheelchair dependent subjects, two with paraplegia (T10-11 and T11-12 lesions) and five with quadriplegia (all with C6-7 lesions), were given two incremental exercise tests to volitional fatigue on separate occasions within a one-week period. Each subject wheeled his or her personal wheelchair, which was mounted on a set of frictionless rollers with side-mounted flywheels. Metabolic and cardiorespiratory responses were continuously monitored by means of an automated metabolic measurement cart interfaced with an electrocardiograph. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences (p greater than .05) between the mean values of the two test trials for six peak values. Reliability coefficients (p less than .01) were: oxygen uptake (0.98), heart rate (0.97), ventilation volume (0.96), respiratory exchange ratio (0.91), oxygen pulse (0.96), and ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (0.88). The investigators concluded that these six physiological responses in subjects with SCI undergoing WE are highly reliable, and that these variables can be used in the objective prescription, monitoring, and evaluation of exercise rehabilitation programs for individuals with SCI. 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura treated with plasma exchange or exchange transfusions. Of 40 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 17 were treated with plasma exchange, 15 with exchange transfusions, and 6 with both types of therapy. One patient died before being treated and another patient was seen but not treated. Plasma exchange was performed daily for a mean of seven exchanges per patient. The replacement fluid during plasma exchange was fresh frozen plasma in all cases. The complete response rates for each type of treatment were as follows: 88% for plasma exchange (15 patients), 47% for exchange transfusions (7 patients), and 67% for exchange transfusions and plasma exchange (4 patients). Clinical and laboratory factors were examined for any statistically significant association with therapy response. Treatment with plasma exchange was statistically the initial factor most strongly associated with prognosis. Paresis, paresthesias, seizures, mental status change, and coma showed no association with response to treatment. Some of the laboratory factors that did not show significant association with treatment response were the initial creatinine, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase, and total bilirubin. This study supports the hypothesis that plasma exchange has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. These patients should be treated aggressively regardless of the severity of their symptoms. 
Infrared, thermistor, and glass-mercury thermometry for measurement of body temperature in children with cancer. Body temperature is often the sole determinant of whether or not the neutropenic cancer patient is admitted to the hospital for empiric antibiotic therapy. Recently developed infrared tympanic thermometers offer rapid readings, but their accuracy has not been established. We studied two infrared thermometers (FirstTemp and Thermoscan) and a thermistor (IVAC) in children with cancer. Mean infrared measurements did not differ significantly between right and left ear canals, and the mean IVAC temperature did not differ significantly from the left to the right axilla (P greater than 0.05, paired t test). IVAC predictive mode mean temperature was 0.2 degrees C lower than monitor mode mean temperature in the axilla (P less than 0.0001), but 0.1 degree C higher than monitor mode orally (P less than 0.0001). Aiming the infrared instrument at the tympanic membrane using an ear tug resulted in a 0.2 degree C higher mean temperature than casual placement in the ear canal (P less than 0.0001). After compensation for the mean difference in reference oral glass-mercury versus test instrument temperatures, the FirstTemp, Thermoscan, and oral and axillary predictive mode IVAC measurements yielded sensitivities for the detection of fever of 84%, 84%, 82%, and 86%; specificities of 100%, 99%, 100%, and 100%; positive predictive values of 100%, 93%, 100%, and 100%; and negative predictive values of 95%, 98%, 98%, and 98%, respectively. We conclude that each of these instruments detects fever with comparable reliability. Infrared instruments are especially attractive alternatives due to their time efficiency. 
Results of the pelvic-pouch procedure in patients with Crohn's disease. The pelvic-pouch procedure has become a standard operation for selected patients with ulcerative colitis, but is contraindicated in patients with Crohn's disease at our institution. However, the distinction between ulcerative colitis and Crohn's colitis can sometimes be difficult, if not impossible. Between January 1982, and March 1989, 272 patients with ulcerative colitis underwent pelvic-pouch procedures at our institution. Nine (3.5 percent) of these patients eventually were found to have Crohn's disease. The records of these patients were examined to assess their clinical outcome and complication rate. There were five females and four males with a mean age of 28.8 years. In five patients (Group I) the diagnosis of Crohn's disease was made postoperatively on histologic examination of the rectum. The ileostomy was closed in all patients. Two developed complications necessitating excision of the pouch. Three patients are well. In the other four cases (Group II) the mean time to diagnosis was 2.5 years after the pouch procedure. Three patients developed pouch-vaginal fistula, and one multiple anal fissures and stenosis. Two required excision of the pouch whereas two have a functioning pouch but with a persistent pouch-vaginal fistula (n = 1) or anal fissures (n = 1). Overall, four patients have had their pouches removed, and five patients have functioning pouches: three with no complications and two with persistent perianal disease. Thus, we would conclude that the pelvic-pouch procedure should not knowingly be performed in patients with Crohn's disease because of the high associated complication rate. 
c-erbB-2 expression in different histological types of invasive breast carcinoma. Sections of 149 breast carcinomas were examined for the over-expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein using the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique and two different specific antibodies. These included the polyclonal antibody 21N and the monoclonal antibody 4D5. The tumours were divided into two main groups. The first included 75 cases of invasive ductal and classic invasive lobular carcinomas. The second group consisted of 74 cases with histological types known to have a good prognosis, including mucinous, alveolar variant of invasive lobular, medullary, tubular, cribriform and papillary carcinomas. Fifteen (20%) tumours of the first group were positive with the two antibodies. Fourteen of these were of the ductal type and one was a mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma. Ten of the pure ductal cases had areas of comedo carcinoma. The intraductal elements in a further tumour were positively stained with 21N antibody only. None of the second group of tumours, which included histological types known to have good prognosis, stained with 4D5, although one mucinous carcinoma was positively stained with 21N. These findings suggest that in invasive breast carcinoma immunostaining for c-erbB-2 is mainly seen in a subgroup of ductal tumours, and that almost all other histological types, especially those associated with good prognosis, lack this expression. 
Risk stratification after myocardial infarction with exercise and Doppler echocardiography. Exercise testing early after myocardial infarction has been shown to be of further risk stratification value among otherwise low-risk patients on the basis of an uncomplicated clinical course. The addition of cardiac imaging modalities to exercise testing has augmented this capacity. Exercise echocardiographic imaging before and immediately after treadmill exercise can be accomplished in 85-95% of patients. New or worsening wall motion abnormalities identify 63-80% of patients who will suffer cardiac events and correctly predict 78-95% of those who will not. In addition, exercise echocardiography can detect multivessel coronary artery disease with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%. These results are superior to those obtained by analyzing global left ventricular function during exercise, exercise aortic Doppler velocity profiles, or exercise electrocardiography. How exercise echocardiography compares with 201Tl perfusion imaging after myocardial infarction awaits a systematic study. Therefore, the choice between exercise echocardiography and perfusion imaging depends on physician preference, availability, cost, and service. 
Incidence of neuropathy in 395 patients with ovarian cancer treated with or without cisplatin. In two consecutive trials, a total of 395 patients with ovarian cancer were treated with a combination of hexamethylmelamine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapeutic regimens including cisplatin or without this drug. With respect to neurotoxicity, 387 patients were fully eligible. The median follow-up for survival was 45 months. Neurotoxicity in any grade of severity developed in 47% of the patients treated with a cisplatin-containing regimen and in 25% of those treated with the non-cisplatin-containing regimen. The severity of neurotoxicity was much higher, however, in the cisplatin-treated patients. Neurotoxicity-free survival decreased below 50% at cumulative doses of cisplatin between 500 and 600 mg/m2. No additional effect of hexamethylmelamine on the incidence or severity of neurotoxicity could be demonstrated. In patients who survived for more than 5 years, the incidence of cisplatin neuropathy was 61%. Prognostic variables (age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage, performance status, and others) possibly associated with high-risk subgroups could not be identified. The only consistent factor correlated with neurotoxicity was the total dose of cisplatin received. 
Cocaine, fetal loss, and the role of the forensic pathologist. Adverse obstetrical outcomes are often associated with maternal cocaine use. These have included intrauterine growth retardation, abruptio placentae, and an increased incidence of spontaneous abortion and pre-term labor. This report details the case of an 18-week-gestation fetus recovered from a sewage treatment plant. A brain specimen was positive for cocaine. With the present epidemic of cocaine abuse, it is important for the forensic pathologist to seek toxicologic evidence of cocaine in all suspicious fetal and neonatal deaths. 
Bile duct diverticula and webs: nonspecific cholangiographic features of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Biliary tree diverticula and webs are considered by several authors to be specific cholangiographic features of primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Our experience suggested that these findings can be seen in patients without PSC. The purpose of this study was twofold: to establish whether diverticula and webs are indeed specific for PSC and to assess whether PSC can be accurately diagnosed without reference to diverticula or webs. We retrospectively reviewed 861 consecutive ERCP studies and found 32 cases of webs and/or diverticula. Using accepted cholangiographic, clinical, and histologic criteria, we diagnosed PSC in nine patients and excluded it in 21, with two instances of uncertain diagnoses. Webs and diverticula seen in PSC were cholangiographically indistinguishable from those in the group without PSC. All 21 patients without PSC had other biliary abnormalities, and were grouped by the predominant abnormality or finding believed to be associated with diverticulum or web formation: common duct stones or cholangitis (n = 11 patients), postoperative stricture (n = 4), bile duct stent and balloon dilatation (n = 3), malignant stricture (n = 2), and choledochoduodenostomy (n = 1). To assess cholangiographic diagnosis of PSC in these patients, a blinded reviewer studied the radiographs of the 30 patients with diverticula and/or webs who had confirmed diagnoses. By using established radiologic criteria alone (ignoring diverticula and webs), the correct diagnosis was made in 27, yielding a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 91%. We conclude that the presence of diverticula and/or webs on a cholangiogram is a nonspecific finding and may be due to inflammation or trauma to the bile duct wall. Further, PSC can be distinguished from other abnormalities on the basis of findings other than diverticula and webs. 
Crackles in interstitial lung disease. Comparison of sarcoidosis and fibrosing alveolitis. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Determine why crackles on chest auscultation are characteristic of most interstitial lung diseases, but may not be heard in sarcoidosis. DESIGN: All patients with sarcoidosis or cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis seen during a four-week period were studied. In a second study to relate ausculatory findings to anatomy, patients with fibrotic changes on their chest roentgenogram were studied. SETTING: Patients were recruited from outpatient clinics. PATIENTS: In the first part, all patients seen over the course of one month were studied. In the second study, patients with pulmonary fibrosis seen on chest roentgenograms were studied. INTERVENTIONS: For the first study, two independent observers performed auscultation on five sites for crackles and reviewed four roentgenogram quadrants for changes. For the second study, patients underwent VC measurements, auscultation, and high resolution computer tomography scans. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: For the first study, crackles were noted at greater than 2 sites in all 11 CFA patients, but only one of 17 SARC patients (p less than 0.001). Roentgenogram changes were seen in greater than 2 quadrants in nine of 11 CFA patients and eight of 17 SARC patients (p = ns). In the second study, the VC was similar in the two groups: SARC: 1.96 +/- .90 L (means +/- SD), 58 +/- 20.4 percent predicted; CFA: 1.81 +/- .33 L, 59 +/- 9.2 percent predicted). Only two of 14 SARC patients had crackles in greater than 1 area, while all 14 CFA patients had crackles at greater than 2 sites. The HRCT studies were read by a radiologist unaware of the diagnosis. The presence and degree (0 to 3 scale) of subpleural and peribronchial fibrosis were scored. Twelve SARC patients had peribronchial changes (mean score 1.9 +/- 1.08), while only eight had subpleural fibrosis (mean score .6 +/- .52). There was a significantly different pattern in the CFA patients, where eight had peribronchial fibrosis (mean score = .9 +/- .78, p less than 0.05) and all 14 had subpleural fibrosis (mean score = 1.6 +/- .73, p less than 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that crackles are more frequent in fibrosing alveolitis than in sarcoidosis; this difference may be due to the distribution of parenchymal fibrosis. 
The novel competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist CGP 37849 preferentially induces phencyclidine-like behavioral effects in kindled rats: attenuation by manipulation of dopamine, alpha-1 and serotonin1A receptors. The novel competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid (CGP 37849) was found to produce a phencyclidine (PCP)-like behavioral syndrome (ataxia, locomotion, stereotypies) in amygdala-kindled rats, whereas the amphetamine-like behavioral alterations of the syndrome (locomotion, stereotypies) were only infrequently seen in nonkindled rats. In dose-response experiments in kindled and nonkindled rats, behavioral effects were scored using a ranked intensity scale, and the behaviors and behavioural scores determined after CGP 37849 were compared with those determined after i.p. administration of the noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine maleate (MK-801). In kindled rats, 20 mg/kg of CGP 37849 produced about the same scores for hyperlocomotion and head weaving as 0.1 mg/kg of MK-801. Kindled rats exhibited higher behavioral scores than nonkindled rats, especially in the case of CGP 37849. The behavioral effects produced by CGP 37849 in kindled rats were almost indistinguishable from the PCP-like behavioral effects induced by MK-801, indicating that CGP 37849 indeed produces a PCP-like pattern of behavior in kindled rats. Hyperlocomotion and head weaving induced by CGP 37849 in kindled rats could be attenuated or totally prevented by pretreatment with ipsapirone, a partial agonist/antagonist at postsynaptic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors of the 5-HT1A subtype. Furthermore, these behavioural effects were attenuated or blocked by the dopamine antagonist haloperidol and the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin. The data demonstrate that kindling induces a hypersensitivity to PCP-like behavioral effects of competitive and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists, which could relate to the recent finding of increased function of NMDA receptors following kindling. 
Electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of bundle branch block. Autopsy and echocardiographic studies indicate that ECG criteria for LVH tend to maintain their sensitivity in the presence of LBBB, with the exception of left precordial lead criteria alone. With RBBB, ECG criteria for LVH using right precordial S waves and combination criteria of right precordial S waves and left precordial R waves have a marked reduction in sensitivity, whereas left precordial R wave criteria have modestly reduced sensitivity. Limb lead criteria for LVH have increased sensitivity in the presence of RBBB and, to a lesser extent, in the presence of LBBB. Acceptable sensitivity for the diagnosis of LVH in patients with bundle branch block requires a combination of limb and precordial lead voltage criteria and/or other nonvoltage ECG criteria, since the prevalence of LVH in the presence of RBBB or LBBB appears higher than the sensitivity of individual criteria. 
Peritoneal leukocyte response following placement of polyglycolic acid intestinal sling in patients with rectal carcinoma. The intestinal sling procedure has been used successfully without the observance of pelvic infections. This procedure involves the implantation of polyglycolic acid (PGA) mesh to hold the bowel out of the pelvis to prevent radiation enteritis. We previously showed that PGA mesh has no intrinsic bactericidal activity. Since phagocytic leukocytes produce reactive oxygen intermediates during respiratory burst that are associated with oxygen-dependent bactericidal activity, we examined peritoneal cell types and their respiratory burst activity isolated from patients with biopsy-confirmed rectal carcinoma who underwent the intestinal sling procedure (N = 12) compared with patients who did not (N = 13). There was no significant difference in the cell types within the peritoneal cavity over the 7-day postoperative period examined. However, there was a significant increase in the ability of leukocytes isolated from mesh patients to produce hydrogen peroxide in the absence of an exogenous stimulus (P less than 0.05), as measured by flow cytometric quantitation of oxidation of the hydroperoxide-sensitive dye, 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA). Despite the higher endogenous DCFH oxidation by leukocytes from mesh patients, the cells retained the ability to oxidize DCFH following treatment with a membrane-active stimulant for respiratory burst activity, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate. These observations suggest that PGA mesh used for the intestinal sling procedure stimulates the respiratory burst activity of peritoneal leukocytes during the postoperative period in which bacterial proliferation and colonization occur. The stimulation of reactive oxygen intermediates involved in oxygen-dependent bactericidal activity by PGA mesh may be one of the mechanisms underlying the lack of infections observed with the use of PGA mesh in contaminated settings. 
Topographic variations in the peripheral course of the greater occipital nerve. Autopsy study with clinical correlations. The description of the peripheral course of the greater occipital nerve (GON) varies in the literature. An autopsy study was done on 20 cases without known headache problems. These findings showed a marked variation in the relation between the GON and nuchal muscles. The trapezius muscle was penetrated by the GON in 45% of cases, the semispinal muscle of the head was penetrated in 90% of cases, and the inferior oblique muscle of head was penetrated in 7.5% of cases. Macroscopic findings of possible compression were made in 11 cases (27.5%), indicating that nerve compression per se may be of minor importance since it seems to exist in the absence of headache. 
Toward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. I. Medical and pathophysiological aspects. Fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is a chronic pain disorder characterized by diffuse musculoskeletal soreness, stiffness, non-restorative sleep and psychological disturbance. At present, much about the etiology, pathological mechanisms and course of FS are unknown. Indeed, standardized diagnostic criteria have only been recently agreed upon. The present paper is the first of a two-part series which reviews the extant empirical literature concerning FS, with a view to arriving at an integrated understanding of the syndrome. The present paper describes the clinical presentation of FS and historical conceptualizations of the disorder. Available research on pathophysiological mechanisms in FS is then presented. In this section we have included literature concerning histology of muscle, sleep architecture, neurotransmitter anomalies and neuropeptide involvement in FS symptomatology. 
MRI reveals multiple reversible cerebral lesions in an attack of acute intermittent porphyria. A 20-year-old woman had an attack of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) with seizures and hallucinations. MRI revealed multiple lesions in both hemispheres. Both the cerebral clinical abnormalities and the MRI lesions resolved following treatment. These findings suggest that a vascular mechanism may underlie the pathogenesis of cerebral dysfunction in AIP. 
Acute effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on plasma atrial natriuretic peptides during exercise in elderly patients with mild hypertension. In a randomized study in 26 elderly patients with mild essential hypertension, acute effects of alpha- and beta-adrenoceptor blockade on plasma ANP levels were examined at rest and during ergometric exercise. Plasma ANP level and LVEF were measured before and after administration of prazosin (an alpha 1-adrenergic blocker), atenolol (a cardioselective beta-adrenergic blocker), or carteolol (a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker). Plasma ANP level was increased by exercise. Carteolol and atenolol increased plasma ANP levels at rest and during exercise, but the effect of atenolol was not statistically significant. Prazosin significantly suppressed the ANP values at rest and during exercise. The LVEF was increased by prazosin and decreased by beta-blockers, especially by carteolol. Multivariate regression analysis showed that LVEF was the most significant predictor of the plasma ANP level at maximal exercise; the resting blood pressure and heart rate were not predictors of this value. The results showed that single administrations of an alpha-blocker and a nonselective beta-blocker had opposite effects on the plasma ANP level both at rest and during exercise in elderly patients with mild essential hypertension. The observed difference in the ANP response seems to be related to changes in left ventricular function rather than changes in blood pressure or heart rate. 
Carrying as colic "therapy": a randomized controlled trial. In healthy infants, crying behavior is reduced significantly by "supplemental" carrying; that is, increased carrying throughout the day in addition to that which occurs during feeding and in response to crying. To determine whether the recommendation to increase carrying would be effective as a therapy for colic, 66 mothers of infants 4 weeks of age or less who came to their pediatricians with complaints of crying problems ("colic") were randomized to receive standard pediatric advice (standard group) or standard advice plus the recommendation to increase supplemental carrying by 50% (supplemental group). Overall, the supplemental group carried their infants 6.1 hours/d throughout the intervention period, an increase of 2.2 hours/d (56%) more than that provided by the standard group. Despite this significant increase in carrying, there was no difference between groups in the duration or frequency of crying, fussing, or cry/fuss at any time throughout the intervention period. When the greatest treatment effect was expected at 6 weeks, the supplemental group infants cried only 3 minutes less per day (95% confidence interval: 37 minutes less to 32 minutes more per day). We conclude that, compared with standard pediatric advice to be "responsive," supplemental carrying does not reduce crying and fussing behavior further in infants who have colic. In marked contrast to healthy infants, this apparent resistance to increased carrying may indicate an important difference in state regulation and control in infants with colic. 
Angiotensin-induced growth related metabolism is activated in cultured smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats. Smooth muscle cells from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) proliferate in culture faster than those isolated from sex- and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) animals. There was no difference in the kinetics of S6 kinase activation in the two cultures, but later metabolic events associated with proliferation were stimulated earlier in SHR cells than in WKY, eg, activation of ornithine decarboxylase. Both cell types elaborated an extensive extra-cellular matrix in culture composed of a different blend of connective tissue macromolecules. Matrix material from SHR cells was more stimulatory to growth of WKY cultures than their own matrices. Angiotensin stimulated the growth and synthesis of extra-cellular matrix material in SHR more than in WKY derived vascular smooth muscle cell cultures. 
Relationship between coronary blood flow and perfusion pressure during reactive hyperemia: a case report in an awake unanesthetized woman with normal coronary arteries. The linear relationship between coronary blood flow and mean arterial pressure during reactive hyperemia is presented for the first time in an awake unanesthetized woman with normal coronary arteries during systemic hypotension induced by pharmacologic vasodilation. This case demonstrates the critical dependence of coronary flow reserve on simultaneous perfusion pressure. 
Age-dependent increase in deleted mitochondrial DNA in the human heart: possible contributory factor to presbycardia. Cardiac function deteriorates with age, and endogenous damage to mitochondrial DNA (mt DNA) is believed to be a major contributory factor to aging. Mitochondria occupy a pivotal position in energy metabolism, and mitochondria have their own DNA, which encodes 13 subunits of the mitochondrial energy transducing system. Other subunits are encoded by nuclear DNA. DNA has been shown to have a high mutation rate, and genetic mutation might primarily be ascribed to mtDNA mutation in the energy transducing system. Recent advances in gene technology, especially in polymerase chain reactions (PCR), permit us to analyze mtDNA mutations in a small quantity of tissue. We devised rapid and accurate methods to detect mitochondrial mutations--the primer shift PCR method, PCR-Southern method, the modified primer shift PCR method, and the asymmetric PCR method. With these methods, we analyzed myocardia mtDNA in human cadavers of various ages (from 3 years old to 97 years old, mean 57 years old). The 7.4 kb deletion of mtDNA was commonly detected in elderly subjects, and the proportion of deleted mtDNA to normal mtDNA increased with age. Deleted mtDNA was observed in all subjects that were over 70 years old. The mutation was based on the directly repeated sequence: 5'-CATCAA-CAACCG-3', which exists in both the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the displacement loop (D-loop) region. Replication impairment occurred at that directly repeated sequence, which caused the elimination of genomes between the adenosine triphosphatase 6 gene and the D-loop region and resulted in a 7.4 kb deletion. 
Indications for modification of coexisting dual atrioventricular node pathways in patients undergoing surgical ablation of accessory atrioventricular connections Concomitant susceptibility to atrioventricular (AV) node reentrant tachycardia has been demonstrated in certain patients having reentrant tachycardia utilizing accessory AV connections. For those patients undergoing accessory connection ablation, AV node surgical modification may be warranted during the same operative procedure. To assess indications for a combined operative procedure, this study evaluated potential predictors of subsequent spontaneous AV node reentrant tachycardia in patients undergoing ablation of accessory AV connections. Among 62 consecutive patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection, 13 (21%) manifested dual AV node pathways. The latter were identified preoperatively in five patients (four with concealed and one with bidirectional accessory connections) and postoperatively in seven (all seven with bidirectional accessory connections). In one patient with a bidirectional accessory connection, dual AV node pathways could not be demonstrated preoperatively, but AV node reentrant tachycardia was induced. Operative ablation of an accessory connection was successful in all patients. However, postoperatively, 2 of the 13 patients had inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia, 5 had AV node "echo" beats and 6 had no inducible arrhythmia. During 26 +/- 7 months of follow-up study, the two patients with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia postoperatively had symptomatic AV node reentrant tachycardia. In addition, the one patient with inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia preoperatively had recurrence of this tachycardia 4 months after attempted surgical modification of the AV node. Consequently, although dual AV node pathways appear to be common in patients undergoing surgical ablation of an accessory AV connection (21%), only a small group (3 of 13) of these patients are at risk for subsequent clinical AV node reentrant tachycardia. 
A mutant alpha subunit of Gi2 induces neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 cells. In a recently discovered class of oncogenes, GTPase-inhibiting mutations constitutively activate alpha subunits of signal-transducing guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). Somatic mutations in a subclass of endocrine tumors are found in the arginine-179 codon of the alpha subunit of Gi2 (alpha i2), creating the putative gip2 oncogene. We have tested the ability of gip2 to mediate neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in tissue culture. Expression of a mutant alpha i2 cDNA encoding cysteine in place of arginine-179 (alpha i2-R179C) caused Rat-1 cells to grow to a higher density in monolayer culture, to lose anchorage dependence, and to form tumors when injected subcutaneously into nude mice. In contrast, expression of alpha i2-R179C failed to alter growth or tumorigenicity of NIH 3T3 cells. We conclude that gip2 is an oncogene, by the criterion that it induces neoplastic transformation of Rat-1 cells. Failure of gip2 to transform NIH 3T3 cells is in keeping with clinical indications that gip2 is a tissue-selective oncogene. 
Prognostic factors in multiple myeloma. The pretreatment characteristics of 265 multiple myeloma patients treated between 1977 and 1983 were evaluated as potential prognostic factors for survival. Patients whose diagnosis was based on bone marrow plasmacytosis (greater than 30%) were noticed to have poorer survival (P less than 0.001). Although classification of patients according to stage has traditionally been used to identify prognostic groups, differences in survival were noted only between Stage III and Stage I or II patients using one of two common staging systems. Multivariate analysis using Cox's proportional hazards model identified the following prognostic factors in order of importance: plasmacytosis (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.49 to 3.27), hypercalcemia (HR = 1.68, CI = 1.22 to 2.32), hypoalbuminemia (HR = 1.51, CI = 1.15 to 1.99), alkaline phosphatase (HR = 1.62, CI = 1.18 to 2.23), hyperuricemia (HR = 1.46, CI = 1.09 to 1.96), and renal insufficiency (HR = 1.48, CI = 1.08 to 2.04). All patients were followed from 2 to 7.5 years and 130 (49%) survived over 2 years. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that hyperuricemia, hypoalbuminemia, renal insufficiency, plasmacytosis, gender, alkaline phosphatase, and hypercalcemia were significant predictors of 2-year survival. Knowledge of these factors could be of value in predicting prognosis and planning therapy in patients with multiple myeloma. 
Collagenous colitis: a prospective trial of prednisolone in six patients. In a prospective study, the clinicopathological effect of prednisolone was evaluated in six patients with collagenous colitis. Prednisolone was associated with a significant decrease in stool frequency. However, the effect was transitory, since the diarrhoea recurred when prednisolone treatment was discontinued. There was a trend toward a diminished inflammatory response in the post-treatment biopsies, but the thickness of the collagen band remained unchanged, except in one patient. Until the results of further studies are available, we recommend that treatment with prednisolone be restricted to periods of acute diarrhoeal episodes. 
Early prediction of acute myocardial infarction from clinical history, examination and electrocardiogram in the emergency room. The possibility of early prediction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was assessed in 7,157 consecutive patients coming to our emergency room during a 21-month period with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of AMI. Of these patients 921 developed an AMI during the first 3 days in the hospital. Of the 4,690 patients admitted to hospital, 1,576 (34%) had a normal admission electrocardiogram, and 90 of these (6%) developed AMI. Of 1,964 patients with an abnormal electrocardiogram without signs of acute ischemia (42% of those admitted), 268 (14%) developed AMI, and 563 (51%) of 1,109 patients with acute ischemia on the electrocardiogram (24%) developed AMI. All patients were prospectively classified in the emergency room on the basis of history, clinical examination and electrocardiogram into 1 of 4 categories, according to the initial degree of suspicion of AMI. Of 279 admitted patients judged to have an obvious AMI (6% of the 4,690), 245 (88%) actually developed AMI; of 1,426 with a strong suspicion of AMI (30%), 478 (34%) developed one; of 2,519 with a vague suspicion of AMI (54%), 192 (8%) developed one; and of 466 with no suspicion of AMI (10%), 6 (1%) developed one. Thus, only a low percentage of the patients with a normal initial electrocardiogram or a vague initial suspicion of AMI developed a confirmed AMI. 
Evaluation of the patient presenting with headache. In order to treat the patient presenting with headache successfully, one must carefully question, examine, and study the complete patient as well as his or her complaint of headache. Through direct and indirect questioning, a complete history may be obtained by exploring present illness, past medical history, family history, personal and social history, and systems review. A detailed medical and neurologic examination is also necessary to evaluate the complaint of headache. A comprehensive screening laboratory profile should be employed, but neurodiagnostic studies should only be used judiciously. A combined medical and neurologic approach will permit appropriate identification and effective treatment of the specific headache disorder rather than the isolated complaint of headache. 
Results of surgery for extratemporal partial epilepsy that began in childhood. Thirty-five consecutive patients who underwent surgery for intractable extratemporal seizures originating in childhood are described. Candidates for surgery were selected on the basis of clinical criteria, neurodiagnostic imaging, and an electroencephalographic investigation that included the use of sphenoidal electrodes and long-term monitoring. Invasive preoperative monitoring was not used. Our results, with respect to the control of seizures and behavioral improvement, are comparable with series in which data from invasive recordings were used in the selection process. Sixty-three percent of the 35 patients (76.5% of those operated on after the introduction of long-term electroencephalographic monitoring) became either seizure free or experienced a reduction in their frequency of seizures by at least 75%. The favorable outcome in this group of patients strengthens the argument for early operation in children with intractable epilepsy, even when the seizure focus is outside the temporal lobe. 
High breath pentane concentrations during acute myocardial infarction To investigate whether reperfusion after myocardial ischaemia leads to free-radical-mediated peroxidation of membrane lipids and cell damage, we measured pentane, a product of lipid peroxidation, in the breath of 10 healthy control subjects and in 20 consecutive patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction. 10 of these patients showed no myocardial damage on electrocardiography (patient control group) and 10 satisfied standard diagnostic criteria for acute myocardial infarction. The three groups were well matched for age, sex, underlying disease, and smoking habits. The time from onset of chest pain to breath collection was similar in the patient control and acute myocardial infarction groups. The breath pentane concentration was higher (p less than 0.0001) in the acute myocardial infarction group (4.96 [1.15] nmol/l) than in the patient control (1.96 [1.04] nmol/l) and healthy control groups (1.71 [0.87] nmol/l). Lipid peroxidation during acute myocardial infarction reflects action of oxygen radicals and their potential for contribution to the pathogenesis of tissue damage. 
T cells from tumor-immune mice nonspecifically expanded in vitro with anti-CD3 plus IL-2 retain specific function in vitro and can eradicate disseminated leukemia in vivo. The therapeutic efficacy of adoptive immunotherapy of cancer has been shown to positively correlate with the dose of tumor-immune T cells transferred. Therefore, the success of this therapy is critically dependent on the ability to procure large numbers of functionally active T cells. Previous studies in animal models have shown that the limited therapeutic efficacy of a small number of immune T cells can be greatly enhanced by expansion of T cells in vitro to greater numbers before transfer in vivo. Optimal regimens for T cell expansion in vitro have generally employed the use of intermittent stimulation of the TCR with specific Ag followed by exogenous IL-2. The use of IL-2 alone does not provide for requisite episodic up-regulation of IL-2R. Stimulation of the invariant CD3 portion of the TCR/CD3 complex with antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3) represents an alternative method of up-regulating IL-2R and has been used to nonspecifically induce the growth of Ag-specific T cell lines and clones long-term in vitro with maintenance of function and specificity. The current study examined whether resting T cell populations containing small numbers of memory tumor-specific T cells could be rendered more effective in tumor therapy by nonspecific expansion in vitro with anti-CD3 plus IL-2. Spleens from C57BL/6 mice previously immunized to FBL-3, a syngeneic virus-induced leukemia, were nonspecifically stimulated with anti-CD3 plus IL-2. The resultant T cells were expanded in number, were nonlytic to FBL-3 but retained the ability to become lytic upon specific stimulation by FBL-3, and were effective in specific tumor therapy. The Ag-specific anti-tumor immune function declined on a per cell basis after each cycle of anti-CD3-induced T cell expansion. However, the approach resulted in a substantial increase in total T cell number and an overall net increase in the function of the effector T cell population. Thus, stimulation of tumor-immune T cell populations with anti-CD3 plus IL-2 represents a nonspecific method for expanding the number of specific effector T cells for cancer therapy. 
Welander's distal myopathy: clinical, neurophysiological and muscle biopsy observations in young and middle aged adults with early symptoms. Nine young or middle aged patients with early symptoms of Welander's distal myopathy were subjected to a detailed neurological examination including quantitative sensory testing, determination of motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV), sensory nerve action potentials, electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy from the tibialis anterior muscle (TA). Slight weakness of the extensors of the fingers and hands was found in all nine patients, and of the dorsiflexors of the feet in seven. All patients had a distal sensory disturbance most prominent for temperature which agrees with earlier observations. EMG changes in TA and extensor digitorum communis (EDC) muscles were of myopathic type. Slight abnormalities compatible with either myopathy or early neuropathy were found in one muscle biopsy. These findings indicate that a neurogenic lesion affecting at least the peripheral sensory system is present at an early stage of Welander's distal myopathy and that the neurogenic lesion might precede the myopathic changes. 
Exercise electrocardiography versus dipyridamole echocardiography testing in coronary angioplasty. Early functional evaluation and prediction of angina recurrence. Recently, we have shown the usefulness of high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography testing (DET) as an exercise-independent method for the evaluation of patients having coronary angioplasty. The purpose of the present study was to determine the value of DET compared with exercise testing in the early functional evaluation after successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) and in the prediction of late recurrence of angina. We performed DET and exercise testing in 52 consecutive patients both before and after successful PTCA. Criteria of positivity for DET were transient dyssynergy absent or negligible in the baseline examination and exercise testing for an ST segment shift greater than 0.1 mV from baseline. All patients had an angiographically successful PTCA: the percent stenosis went from 78 +/- 7% before to 30 +/- 7% after PTCA. Exercise testing was positive in 49 and 29 patients, respectively, before and after PTCA (94% versus 44%, p less than 0.001). DET was positive in 47 patients before and in 10 after PTCA (90% versus 19%, p less than 0.001). Recurrence of angina was found in 18 patients: 14 of 23 with positive and four of 29 with negative exercise testing after PTCA. With DET, recurrence of angina was found in eight of 10 patients with positive and 10 of 42 with negative DET after PTCA. 
Cutaneous multilobated T-cell lymphoma with aggressive course. Cutaneous multilobated T-cell lymphoma is an uncommon variant of skin-based peripheral T-cell lymphoma typically characterized by cutaneous nodules in elderly patients and a chronic clinical course. We report a case of the disease that led to the patient's death within 2 years after onset. This disease may be associated with a more aggressive clinical course than generally recognized. 
Coronary angioplasty in octogenarians: comparisons to coronary bypass surgery. Coronary angioplasty was performed in 74 patients 80 years of age and older (mean 83 +/- 3). Single vessel coronary disease was present in 34% and multivessel coronary disease in 66%. Angioplasty of a single vessel was performed in 51 patients (69%), while 23 (31%) had angioplasty of multiple vessels. Angioplasty was successful in 59 of 74 patients (80%). Angioplasty was unsuccessful but uncomplicated in 12 (16%) due to (unyielding) calcified lesions or (impassable) old occlusions. Of these 12, 8 were discharged on medical therapy and 4 underwent elective uncomplicated bypass surgery prior to discharge. Three (4%) patients required emergency coronary bypass surgery due to abrupt vessel closure during the angioplasty procedure, with one hospital death (1.4%). Follow-up (mean 24 +/- 22 months) was obtained in all patients. Of the 59 successful angioplasty patients, late mortality was 10% (cardiac 7% and non-cardiac 3%). Survival and survival without myocardial infarction were both 90%; survival without either infarction or bypass surgery was 86%. Actuarial 3-year survival was 91% and 3-year freedom from death, infarction or bypass surgery was 87% by life-table analysis. Repeat angioplasty for restenosis was performed in 7 patients (12%) without complications. 
Prevention of deep vein thrombosis after elective hip surgery. A randomized trial comparing low molecular weight heparin with standard unfractionated heparin OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative efficacy and safety of low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (Enoxaparin) compared with standard calcium heparin for the prevention of postoperative deep vein thrombosis in patients undergoing elective hip surgery. DESIGN: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. PATIENTS: Six hundred sixty-five consecutive patients undergoing hip replacement at five participating hospitals. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received either fixed-dose LMW heparin, 30 mg subcutaneously twice daily, or fixed-dose standard calcium heparin, 7500 units subcutaneously twice daily; both regimens were started 12 to 24 hours after surgery and continued for 14 days or until discharge if sooner. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had postoperative I-125-fibrinogen leg scanning and impedance plethysmography. If results of one or both tests were positive, then venography was done. Otherwise, venography was done between day 10 and day 14, or sooner if the patient was ready for discharge. RESULTS: Evaluable venograms were obtained in 258 of the 333 patients randomly assigned to receive LMW heparin and in 263 of the 332 patients assigned to receive calcium heparin. For patients with evaluable venograms, thrombosis was detected in 50 patients (19.4%) who received LMW heparin compared with 61 patients (23.2%) who received standard heparin (difference, -3.8%; 95% CI, -11.1% to 3.6%) (P greater than 0.2). Proximal deep vein thrombosis was detected in 5.4% of the patients receiving LMW heparin and in 6.5% of the patients receiving standard heparin (difference, -1.1%; CI, - 5.2% to 3.3%) (P greater than 0.2). For the entire group of 665 patients, venous thrombosis occurred in 17.1% given LMW heparin and in 19.0% given standard heparin. Hemorrhagic complications occurred in 31 patients (9.3%) given standard heparin and in 17 patients (5.1%) given LMW heparin (difference, 4.2%; CI, 0.3% to 8.2%) (P = 0.035). The relative risk reduction was 45%. The rate of major bleeding in the standard heparin group was 5.7% compared with 3.3% in the LMW heparin group (difference, 2.4%; CI, -1.0% to 5.4%) (P = 0.13). The relative risk reduction was 42%. CONCLUSION: Low molecular weight heparin is significantly less hemorrhagic than standard unfractionated heparin; the difference in the rate of deep vein thrombosis, although not statistically significant (P greater than 0.2), favors the use of LMW heparin. 
Posterior semicircular canal occlusion in the normal hearing ear. This report outlines our experience with posterior semicircular canal occlusion, a new operative procedure for intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). We postulate that the resulting solid canal "plug" prevents endolymph movement within the posterior canal, which effectively fixes the cupula. This selectively abolishes the receptivity of the posterior canal to both angular acceleration and gravity without influencing the other inner ear receptors. We previously reported the success of this procedure in two patients with BPPV and a co-existing profound sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear. Since that report, a slightly modified technique has been used to occlude six more posterior canals--five in normal hearing ears. While our follow-up times range from only 3 to 18 months, all eight patients continue to be relieved of their BPPV. Temporary mixed hearing losses occurred in three of the five ears with normal preoperative hearing. Hearing in all five patients ultimately returned to the preoperative state. We believe this procedure is a simpler and safer alternative to singular neurectomy for the treatment of intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. 
Characterization of human renal fibroblasts in health and disease: I. Immunophenotyping of cultured tubular epithelial cells and fibroblasts derived from kidneys with histologically proven interstitial fibrosis. Recently, it has been shown that inflammatory and noninflammatory glomerular diseases are often complicated by changes in the tubulointerstitial system, mostly caused by renal interstitial fibrosis (IF). To analyze pathomechanisms of these tubulointerstitial lesions, growth behavior and expression of cell surface molecules of tubular epithelial cells and renal fibroblasts in culture, established using renal biopsies of IF, were studied. Furthermore, the capacity of renal fibroblasts in culture to produce extracellular matrix was investigated. Expression of MHC-class II antigens on proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTECs) has been induced by supplementing the culture medium with interferon gamma. Renal fibroblasts, the major cell types growing out from renal biopsies with interstitial fibrosis, form so-called hillocks in culture and synthesize collagen type I, III, and V. Further analysis using cocultures of tubular epithelial or renal endothelial cells on the one hand, and defined renal fibroblasts on the other, will clarify the interaction between these cell types, which probably will lead to a better understanding of the pathomechanisms causing disease progression. 
Asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria in children. The clinical features, renal biopsy findings, and subsequent course in 53 children with asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria were studied retrospectively (1) to determine the prevalence of renal pathologic abnormalities among these children, (2) to identify those clinical characteristics that may enable recognition of children with an increased likelihood of having renal pathologic abnormalities, and (3) to assess the clinical course. All biopsy specimens were examined by light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. Twenty-five patients (47%) had significant glomerular changes (15 had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 4 IgA nephropathy, 3 diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis without IgA deposition, and 3 membranous glomerulonephritis), and 28 had minimal glomerular changes. There were no differences between the patients with significant glomerular changes and those with minimal glomerular changes with regard to clinical and laboratory findings except for a predominance of boys in the former group. At the latest follow-up, seven patients with significant glomerular changes, but none with minimal glomerular changes, had chronic renal impairment. Because of the high incidence of significant glomerular changes and the high rate of progression to chronic renal impairment, we believe that a renal biopsy is indicated for a child with asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria. 
Single lung transplantation. Alternative indications and technique. Twenty-two patients have undergone 23 single lung transplants between March 1980 and April 1990 at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. The actuarial survival rate is 77.27% at 12 months and 72.73% at 24 months. There have been no instances of bronchial dehiscence or stenosis, even though 13 of the patients were on a program of preoperative prednisone, every patient had high-dose perioperative methylprednisolone, and omental wraps were not used on any bronchial anastomosis. Of particular interest is the fact that three patients had primary pulmonary hypertension, three had secondary pulmonary hypertension, and 10 patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, due in five cases to an alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency. Each of these entities was previously thought to contraindicate single lung transplantation. Donor selection was based on an oxygen tension/inspired oxygen concentration ratio greater than 300, donor/recipient chest circumference within 3 inches, clear chest x-ray film, negative sputum Gram stain, and less than 6-hour estimated ischemic time. Harvest technique included donor prostaglandin E1 500 micrograms, topical slush, and pulmonoplegia with cold Euro-Collins solution. The heart and lung were separated in situ rather than the heart lung block being removed. A telescoping bronchial anastomosis was performed with 4-0 Prolene (not absorbable) sutures. We conclude that single lung transplantation has evolved into a simple operation, necessitating meticulous preoperative and postoperative care, which can be performed on a wide spectrum of critically ill patients with an acceptable mortality rate. 
Long-term survival analysis in hereditary hemochromatosis. This study investigated the long-term survival rates of 85 patients with hereditary hemochromatosis. Eighty-five patients with documented hereditary hemochromatosis diagnosed between 1958 and 1989 and followed up at the University Hospital (University of Western Ontario) medical center were retrospectively reviewed for this analysis. The current status of the patient was assessed by interview or written questionnaire completed by the patient or the family physician. Estimates of differences in survival rates were obtained using Kaplan-Meier life-table and Cox regression analysis. Liver histology, clinical features of the disease, and number of venesections were analyzed to determine their relationship to survival. In the course of a mean follow-up interval of 8.1 +/- 6.8 years (range, 0-31 years), there were 17 deaths among the 85 hemochromatosis patients. Patients with cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis were 5.5 times more likely to die than noncirrhotic patients. Patients who were noncirrhotic at the time of diagnosis had an estimated survival that was not significantly different from age- and sex-matched members of the normal population. Diabetes did not increase the risk of death after data were controlled for the presence of cirrhosis. Early diagnosis and treatment of hemochromatosis in the precirrhotic stage can lead to long-term survival similar to that in the general population. The presence of cirrhosis significantly increases mortality and is the major clinical factor affecting survival. 
Premenstrual syndrome. Because researchers are still seeking the cause of PMS, we cannot recommend a single treatment approach that will work satisfactorily with all women who have the syndrome. Investigators have made progress, however, toward defining and diagnosing the condition. We also can help women whose lives are disrupted each month by prescribing specific approaches to symptom management. 
Ifosfamide, Fanconi's syndrome, and rickets. Three of 218 children treated with ifosfamide plus the uroprotectant mesna, in single- or combination-agent protocols, have developed Fanconi's renal syndrome, all of whom were in a subgroup of 86 children who had also received cisplatin or carboplatin therapy. Patients receiving ifosfamide who have received prior cisplatin (or carboplatin) are at significantly higher risk of developing Fanconi's syndrome than are those who have received no prior nephrotoxic therapy (P = .04). The role of prior nephrotoxic therapy, including cisplatin and its derivatives, and the total dose of ifosfamide should be considered in the assessment of this rare but serious and apparently irreversible side effect. 
Gastric antral vascular ectasia associated with gastric carcinoma. Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE), or watermelon stomach, is an uncommon cause of chronic gastrointestinal blood loss and iron deficiency anemia. Although GAVE has not previously been reported in association with gastric cancer, it is often associated with atrophic gastritis and pernicious anemia, which are known risk factors for gastric malignancy. We report a 72-yr-old woman with pernicious anemia who was found to have GAVE associated with adenosquamous carcinoma of the gastric cardia and adenocarcinoma in situ of the pylorus. In view of recent reports of the use of endoscopic modalities rather than surgical resection to treat GAVE, our case alerts endoscopists to the possibility of coexisting carcinoma. 
Adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy for superficial bladder cancer. In 1990, bladder cancer, excluding carcinoma in situ, was estimated to contribute 49,000 cases of cancer. In men 75 years old or older, it became the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths. Of patients with bladder cancer, 75%-80% initially present with superficial bladder tumors. Treatment of these tumors has three objectives: 1) to eradicate existing disease, 2) to provide prophylaxis against tumor recurrence, and 3) to avoid deep invasion into the muscle layers of the bladder. Transurethral resection is the primary treatment to eradicate superficial bladder tumors, but 40%-80% of these tumors recur. Because of these high recurrence rates, adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy with cytotoxic and immunomodulatory drugs has gained widespread use. The past two decades of clinical investigations in superficial bladder cancer have provided valuable information on the biology and treatment of the disease. Multivariate analyses have indicated that tumor grade and stage are the most important prognostic variables commonly available to the clinician to identify the patient at greatest risk of developing muscle-invasive or metastatic bladder cancer. These studies have also identified groups at low risk for tumor recurrence and invasive bladder cancer. Randomized trials have shown that recurrence rates are decreased by adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy with a number of drugs: bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine (BCG), doxorubicin, ethoglucid (Epodyl), mitomycin-C, teniposide, and thiotepa. However, few studies indicate that adjuvant intravesicular pharmacotherapy can prevent progression to invasive bladder cancer in the high-risk patient with superficial bladder cancer. Additional clinical trials are needed to determine whether such therapy can prevent invasive and metastatic bladder cancer and improve disease-free survival in this group. In addition, the identification of tests (e.g., monoclonal antibody tests, chromosomal analyses, and tumor marker assays) that can help to identify high-risk patients is needed to better develop therapeutic strategies for superficial bladder cancer. 
Primary malignant melanoma of the scrotum: case report and literature review. Malignant melanoma of the scrotum is the rarest of primary genitourinary melanomas, with only 3 cases reported previously. We present an additional case of this often aggressive malignancy. The pertinent literature is reviewed and the current management strategies are discussed. 
A controlled study of the effectiveness of spot dermabrasion ('scarabrasion') on the appearance of surgical scars. We report the results of a controlled study on the use of spot dermabrasion ("scarabrasion") on surgical scars. In a split scar model, linear scars produced by full-thickness surgical excisions on the face, trunk, and extremities were studied in 48 patients. Results of abrasion of the left (top) half of each scar were compared with the untreated right (bottom) half. Although scars were improved at 4 and 6 weeks after injury, a significantly greater number responded to abrasion at 8 weeks (p less than 0.05). All regions of the body showed comparable improvement. The diamond fraise was found to be an effective instrument for scarabrasion. 
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome associated with endodermal sinus tumor of the ovary. Both EST and Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome are uncommon disorders. This report illustrates a case of these two rare conditions occurring in the same patient. Patients with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome, although not appearing to be at increased risk for germ cell tumors, unlike testicular feminization patients, are not immune to ovarian cancer. Therefore, individuals with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome should still be followed gynecologically because they are at least at the normal risk of developing ovarian as well as other gynecological neoplasms. 
Thrombolysis in refractory unstable angina. Multiple drug therapy, including nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists, aspirin, and heparin, has been advocated as effective in the treatment of unstable angina, a syndrome with a multifactorial pathogenesis. Recently, plaque rupture and thrombosis have been demonstrated as the most important pathogenetic mechanisms. Nevertheless, clear-cut results on the effects of thrombolytic treatment in unstable angina are still lacking. Some possible explanations why the medical treatment of unstable angina has still not yet been standardized, whereas that of myocardial infarction has, are suggested. A review of randomized and nonrandomized studies published on this topic evaluating the role of different thrombolytic agents in unstable angina is presented. In addition the role of coronary angiography is discussed. In view of the disappointing results of coronary artery bypass surgery performed in the acute phase of the disease, one of the goals of clinical research is to identify subsets of patients at high and low risk and who undergo different types of therapeutic interventions. To support published data suggesting that total myocardial ischemia has a significant impact on prognosis, we present our results of a study carried out on patients with refractory unstable angina treated with thrombolytic therapy and evaluated with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in the attempt to correlate total myocardial ischemia with short-term prognosis. Data in favor of the prognostic role of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in unstable angina are also reviewed. Finally, we propose some suggestions that might be useful for future studies. 
Emergency department treatment of alcohol withdrawal seizures with phenytoin. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Prevention of recurrent alcohol withdrawal seizures is a common emergency department problem. A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of adequate size was designed to assess the efficacy of phenytoin in preventing recurrence of alcohol withdrawal seizures. METHODS: Fifty-five patients who had seized from alcohol withdrawal were randomly assigned to treatment with IV phenytoin or placebo. Patients with known seizure disorders and those receiving any anticonvulsant were excluded. The study was terminated after seizure recurrence or passage of a six-hour, high-risk seizure interval. RESULTS: Six of 28 phenytoin-treated patients (21%) had recurrent seizures compared with five of 27 placebo-treated patients (19%). The 95% confidence interval for the difference in response probabilities was +16% to -20%. There was no statistically significant difference between the response rates for the two treatments (P greater than .05). CONCLUSION: Phenytoin does not show significant benefit over placebo in preventing recurrence of alcohol withdrawal seizures. 
Natural history of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To describe the natural history and disease progression of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome and to assess the therapeutic effects of orally administered steroids on the disorder as of October 1990. DESIGN: Case-series analysis. A cohort of 45 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome was followed prospectively by periodic telephone interviews and medical examinations for an average of 14 months after onset of illness. SETTING: Washington state. PATIENTS: The cases of 47 patients were reported to the Washington State Department of Health from 1 July to 12 December 1989. Two patients were unavailable for follow-up, and the remaining 45 completed the study. MAIN RESULTS: Patients were predominantly non-Hispanic white women (87%) with an average age of 49 years. Symptoms typically progressed from early onset of myalgia and fatigue to later development of neurologic and scleroderma-like skin changes. Six (13%) patients recovered completely within 2 to 5 months of symptom onset. After 14 months of illness, over half of the patients who initially presented with myalgia, fatigue, or scleroderma-like skin changes remained symptomatic. The average severity of each major symptom was measured using interviews and patient self-reports and has improved subjectively by at least 40%. Statistical analyses showed no significant difference in long-term symptom duration or severity between patients treated and those not treated with prednisone. CONCLUSIONS: The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a long-term illness characterized by progressive improvement during the first 25 weeks after symptom onset, followed by a protracted phase of symptom resolution. We could not show a clear-cut benefit of prednisone in reducing the long-term severity or duration of the disease. 
Leptomeningeal dissemination of optic pathway gliomas in three children. We treated three children with optic pathway gliomas who had progressive disease associated with metastatic spread to the leptomeninges. One patient had radiographic resolution of leptomeningeal disease after treatment with intravenous carmustine and oral mercaptopurine but died of progressive pulmonary fibrosis. The second patient was treated with intravenous thiotepa, and the leptomeningeal disease remained stable. The third patient was treated with intravenous vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and etoposide and had a significant size reduction of the leptomeningeal lesion. Although leptomeningeal dissemination is a seemingly rare event, it is important that all children with optic pathway gliomas be considered for this possibility, particularly after the onset of new, atypical neurologic symptoms. 
Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide and gastrin in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and insulinoma. Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and gastrin were measured in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, insulinoma-bearing rats and their respective controls. Rats injected with streptozotocin exhibited hyperphagia, insulinopenia and severe hyperglycemia. Stomach weights, and the concentrations and total amounts of GRP and gastrin in the stomach, were similar to nondiabetic control rats. The concentration of somatostatin in the stomach of diabetic rats was 25% greater, but the total stomach content of somatostatin was similar to that of control rats. Insulinoma-bearing rats exhibited hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. Concentrations of GRP and gastrin in the stomach were 72% and 19% lower, respectively, than in control rats. Despite 45% greater stomach weight, the total stomach content of GRP was 61% lower. Stomach concentrations of somatostatin, and total stomach contents of somatostatin and gastrin, were similar in insulinoma-bearing and control rats. The results demonstrate abnormalities in the stomach concentrations of regulatory peptides in rats with diabetes and insulinoma. These abnormalities are not attributable to changes in food intake alone, suggesting specific effects of these metabolic diseases on gastric regulatory peptides and gastric function. 
Interpretation of the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference in patients with hypercapnia. According to conventional wisdom the difference between alveolar and arterial O2 tensions, the AaPO2, should distinguish between hypoxemia caused by alveolar hypoventilation and hypoxemia caused by alveolar hypoventilation complicated by other abnormalities of gas exchange. To test this concept we have calculated the AaPO2 from arterial blood gas measurements, breathing air, in 23 patients with hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and advanced obstructive lung disease (mean FEV1 = 0.88 L). We found that AaPO2 varied inversely with PaCO2 (r = -0.83, p less than 0.001). In five of these patients with the most severely elevated PaCO2 (range, 59 to 81 mm Hg) the AaPO2 was within normal limits. We also calculated the difference between the O2 contents of "ideal" pulmonary capillary blood and arterial blood and expressed this as the venous admixture (QVA/QT) based on an assumed arteriovenous content difference of 4.5 ml/dl. In contrast to the AaPO2, the QVA/QT, was abnormal in all patients (mean = 41 +/- 8%). We conclude that the AaPO2 may be an unreliable indicator of abnormal gas exchange in the presence of alveolar hypoventilation. This finding can be explained by substantial changes in the position of the alveolar and arterial points on the oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin in the presence of alveolar hypoxia secondary to hypoventilation.
