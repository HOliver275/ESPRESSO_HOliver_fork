Total coronary occlusion: a different animal? Provided collateralization is adequate, a chronic total coronary occlusion clinically imitates a 90% stenosis but is exempt from the risk of myocardial infarction. For angioplasty of vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion, technical difficulties and clinical risks are balanced against projected subjective benefit and amount of viable myocardium concerned. The primary success rate is approximately 65% and complications are rare because abrupt vessel reclosure may be common but is harmless. New Q wave infarction in that context has not been reported. The duration of occlusion is the most important predictor of success. The length of the occluded segment is also important. Recurrence averages 68% (21% reocclusion and 47% restenosis) and happens typically within 6 months. The high recurrence rate is due to competitive pressure exerted by collateral vessels and an often suboptimal local result. Even if the primary success rate of angioplasty in vessels with chronic total coronary occlusion can be improved by advanced technology and skill, the clinical yield will remain low compared with that of angioplasty of stenoses. Because low yield procedures must be low risk and low cost, there are definite limits to how sophisticated, risky and expensive new techniques can become. Derivatives of conventional balloon systems are likely to remain the equipment of first choice, perhaps complemented by mechanical drills. Although chronic total coronary occlusions are no clinical menace in contrast to stenoses, they frequently deserve revascularization and are the reason to select bypass surgery over angioplasty. These factors justify endeavors to improve recanalization techniques that help to refine coronary angioplasty of nontotal lesions, because total occlusion, albeit a different animal, is of the same species. 
Chronic abacterial prostatitis and hyperthermia. A possible new treatment? A group of 45 patients with chronic abacterial prostatitis or prostatodynia underwent 6 weekly, 1-hour sessions of local deep microwave hyperthermia (42.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C) to the prostate. All patients had a long history of symptoms typical of the condition. They all failed to respond to a variety of conventional treatments administered over several years by various specialists. Each patient served as his own control before and after the hyperthermic treatment. The results of this study are encouraging: 25% showed a sustained and complete loss of symptoms and 50% had a partial response; the remaining 25% reported no improvement. These results open up new possibilities in the treatment of this condition, which has so far responded poorly to conventional therapy. 
Clinical decision making of critical care nurses managing computer-simulated tachydysrhythmias. The purposes of this study were to describe the clinical decision making of critical care nurses managing computer-simulated tachydysrhythmias and to assess the major sources of error related to the management of two tachydysrhythmias: atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia. In this descriptive study, 142 critical care nurses each completed four computerized clinical simulations (two atrial flutter and two ventricular tachycardia). Simulation performance was measured by proficiency score (comparison with expert performance), patient outcome (cure or die), and amount of data collected before the first intervention. Mean proficiency scores were 51% for atrial flutter and 35% for ventricular tachycardia. Thirteen percent of the atrial flutter and 35% of the ventricular tachycardia simulations ended in patient death. Failure to recognize ventricular tachycardia and unfamiliarity with second- and third-line treatments were major sources of error. Medication errors were the cause of death in 87% of the simulations ending in patient death. These results document the need for emphasis on dysrhythmia management in the critical care curriculum. 
Quadrantic visual field defects. A hallmark of lesions in extrastriate (V2/V3) cortex. We report 2 patients with homonymous quadrantic visual field defects. The first patient experienced scintillations in the left lower quadrant, leading to the discovery of an astrocytoma in the cuneus of the right occipital lobe. Postoperatively she had a left lower quadrantanopia that precisely respected the horizontal meridian. The second patient presented with a left lower quadrantanopia, sparing the central 10 degrees of vision that also respected the horizontal meridian. An astrocytoma was resected from the right upper peristriate cortex. We must explain how a lesion in extrastriate cortex produced a homonymous field defect with a sharp horizontal edge in these 2 patients. Areas V2 and V3 are each divided along the horizontal meridian into separate halves flanking striate cortex. Consequently, the upper and lower quadrants in extrastriate cortex are physically isolated on opposite sides of striate cortex. We propose that a lesion involving V2/V3 may be sufficient to create a visual field defect. Although the lesion may have irregular margins, if it crosses the representation of the horizontal meridian in extrastriate cortex, it will produce a quadrantic visual field defect with a sharp horizontal border because of the split layout of the upper and lower quadrants in V2/V3. 
Hypoechoic lesions in fatty liver. Quantitative study by histomorphometry. Ten patients with fatty liver changes were subjected to liver biopsies. In seven, ultrasonography showed focal hypoechogenicity within a "bright" liver, generally interpreted as focal sparing. Three patients had hyperechoic areas surrounded by "normal" parenchyma usually felt to represent local fat accumulation without diffuse involvement. Morphometric analysis was used to determine the total area occupied by fat (area density) and the number of lipid droplets (numerical density) per microscopic field in lesional and perilesional specimens. Compared with respective perilesional values, hypoechoic lesional numerical densities were significantly lower in 6 of 7 patients; the three hyperechoic samples had significantly higher values. In most cases, lesional and perilesional area densities were not significantly different. These hypoechoic focal lesions are believed to be merely areas in which a similar quantity of fat is contained in fewer droplets, and focal hyperechogenicity is believed to result from a larger number of fat-filled vacuoles with respect to that of the surrounding parenchyma. Variation in the number of solid-liquid interfaces causes the ultrasonic contrast between these lesions and the similarity fatty liver parenchyma surrounding them. 
Continuous ambulatory ECG monitoring in the perioperative period: relationship of preoperative status and outcome. We have used continuous ambulatory electrocardiography in the perioperative period to monitor 108 patients with known cardiovascular disease undergoing non-cardiac surgery. There was a high incidence of ischaemic ST segment changes and ventricular arrhythmias. For the group as a whole, anaesthesia and surgery were followed by increased ventricular ectopic activity, but did not worsen myocardial ischaemia. However, the mean duration of ischaemic ST segment changes was increased significantly in those patients with treated hypertension. Of the risk factors considered, preoperative ischaemia and peroperative systolic arterial pressure were significant correlates with postoperative myocardial ischaemia. 
Diagnostic value of measurement of serum type I procollagen carboxy terminal peptides in patients with scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach. We have evaluated the radioimmunoassay for type I procollagen carboxy terminal peptide (type I C-peptide), which is liberated from type I procollagen during its conversion to collagen, in the serodiagnosis of scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach. The mean (SD) serum concentration of type I C-peptide in 39 normal subjects was 41.7 (19.7) ng/ml. The mean serum values and the positive ratio of type I C-peptide in 11 patients with stages II and III scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach were 91.2 (41.9) ng/ml and 54.5%, respectively. In 10 patients with other types of gastric carcinoma, the mean type I C-peptide values were not significantly different from the normal value. Serum type I C-peptide values reflected the clinical course of scirrhous gastric carcinoma in five patients who underwent either operation or chemotherapy. The measurement of serum type I C-peptide concentrations could provide a useful way of diagnosing and monitoring scirrhous carcinoma of the stomach. 
Effects of time required for reperfusion (thrombolysis or angioplasty, or both) and location of acute myocardial infarction on left ventricular functional reserve capacity several months later. The purpose of this study was to determine whether reperfusion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) by recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, or both, would improve left ventricular (LV) function when it is measured several months later at rest or maximal bicycle exercise, or both. Radionuclide angiography was performed in 44 patients 5 months (range 6 weeks to 9 months) after AMI to assess function, and tomographic myocardial thallium-201 imaging was performed at maximal exercise and delayed rest to determine whether there was any evidence of myocardial ischemia. As expected, no patient had chest pain or redistribution of a thallium defect during the exercise test, because patients had undergone angioplasty (n = 28) or coronary bypass graft surgery (n = 5) where clinically indicated for revascularization. The LV ejection fraction was plotted as a function of the time elapsed between the onset of chest pain and the time when coronary angiography confirmed patency of the infarct-related artery (achieved in 91% of 44 patients by rt-PA [n = 31] or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [n = 9] ). Functional responses differed markedly between patients with anterior (n = 20) versus inferior (n = 24) wall AMI. LV ejection fraction during exercise correlated with time to reperfusion in patients with an anterior wall AMI (r = -0.58; standard error of the estimate = 11.9%; p less than 0.02) but not in patients with an inferior AMI (r = 0.10; standard error of the estimate = 13.1%; difference not significant. 
Cryosurgery in 50 cases of tongue carcinoma. From March 1975 to October 1985, 50 patients with primary tongue carcinoma were treated by cryosurgery. Forty-seven had squamous cell carcinoma, and 3 had other types of malignant tumors. The TNM clinical classification showed 12 patients with T1 lesions, 35 with T2, and 3 with T3. All patients were treated by cryosurgery in the outpatient clinic under local anesthesia. Three weeks after the primary tumors were controlled cryosurgically, 48 patients underwent radical neck dissections. All patients were observed for 3 to 10 years. After cryosurgery, the primary lesion disappeared in 45 (90%) patients; 5 were not controlled. The 3- and 5-year survival rates were 71.9% (23/32) and 72.3% (13/18), respectively. The recurrence rate in this series was 10% (5/50). Cryosurgery for tongue carcinoma was shown to be effective and safe. 
Successful combined operation for Takayasu's arteritis. We report a case of Takayasu's arteritis complicated with aortic regurgitation and severe stenosis of the left coronary ostium and the innominate artery. Simultaneous surgical treatment of aortic valve replacement, coronary ostium endarterectomy, and aortosubclavian artery bypass using saphenous vein were performed. We discuss the choice of simultaneous operation and the option of surgical treatment for coronary ostium lesion due to Takayasu's arteritis. 
Morphologic features and nuclide composition of infarction-associated cardiac myocyte mineralization in humans. Low dietary Mg results in Ca loading of cardiac myocytes, which increases the likelihood of myocyte calcification in the event of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and possibly increases myocyte vulnerability to necrosis. Bloom and Peric-Golia1 previously reported an autopsy study of cases from the Washington, D.C. area (a region with low levels of Mg in the drinking water), demonstrating AMI-associated mineralization in myocytes with histologically normal nuclei and cross striations, as well as in obviously necrotic myocytes. The authors have re-examined mineralized myocytes from the same autopsy material, using electron probe microanalysis, light microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. Microprobe analysis identified Ca and P as the nuclides composing the inorganic phase of the mineral deposits. Ultrastructurally, all Ca deposits, regardless of size or intracellular location, were composed of aggregates of needlelike hydroxyapatite crystals. The mildest form of intracellular Ca deposition was observed as small Ca deposits limited to some mitochondria of myocytes, which demonstrated intact nuclei and regular sarcomere pattern. More advanced stages of intracellular calcification, in the form of Ca deposits associated with mitochondria, Z-band regions and nuclei, were observed in other myocytes that also retained intact nuclei and sarcomeres. Massive Ca deposits were associated with myocytes which showed morphologic features of advanced necrosis, including loss of nuclei, disruption of sarcomere structure and masses of cellular debris. These observations support the theory originally proposed by Bloom and Peric-Golia1 suggesting that Ca loading of myocytes, possibly related to Mg deficiency in humans, increased vulnerability of the myocytes to subsequent AMI-associated necrosis and dystrophic calcification. In addition, the light microscopic impression of calcification of otherwise normal myocytes is contradicted by the electron microscopic identification of hydroxyapatite crystals free in the sarcoplasm, a condition unlikely to be compatible with viability. Lastly, the fact that all Ca deposits were in the form of hydroxyapatite supports the view that they were formed in a Mg-poor environment, which favors conversion of the more common amorphous form of Ca phosphate into the needlelike crystals of hydroxyapatite. 
Nd:YAG laser and photodynamic therapy for esophageal and endobronchial tumors under general and local anesthesia. Effects on arterial blood gas levels. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the respiratory and acid-base metabolism response to endoscopic laser surgery for obstructive tumors, as related to the duration and different types of endoscopy, anesthesia, and laser treatment. DESIGN: The design was a case-control, cohort analytic, nonrandomized controlled survey of case series before and after endoscopic procedures. SETTING: A referral-based surgery and oncology practice at one hospital's laser center. PATIENTS: We studied a sequential sample of 82 patients in the age range from 35 to 92 years, with malignant and benign, primary and metastatic, partially and completely obstructing esophageal (15 patients) and endobronchial (67 patients) tumors. INTERVENTIONS: A total of 229 diagnostic, laser treatment, and follow-up endoscopic procedures was performed under general or local anesthesia (46 esophagoscopies and 183 bronchoscopies). The latter group consisted of 29 cases of general and 154 cases of local topical anesthesia. The last group involved 37 diagnostic and toilet bronchoscopies, 86 cases of YAG-laser tumor ablation, and 31 cases of PDT. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Direct-reading electrode measurements of arterial blood, sampled before and immediately after the endoscopic procedure, revealed statistically significant (p less than 0.001) increases in PaCO2 (200 of 229 cases) and decreases in pH (195 of 229 cases) and PaO2 (215 of 229 cases). These findings were similar after bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy, general and local anesthesia (only the decrease in pH was less pronounced in the latter case), and explorative endoscopies and different laser treatments and did not correlate with the total duration of the procedure within the wide time range of 7 to 210 minutes. The initial preoperative level of PaCO2 was considerably higher and the level of PaO2 was significantly lower in patients with endobronchial tumors, as compared to patients with esophageal cancer. A strong, inverse linear relationship was found between the perioperative changes in PaO2 and its initial level and between PaCO2 and pH changes. CONCLUSIONS: The PDT for esophageal and endobronchial malignancies is no more harmful for acid-base metabolism and respiratory functions than YAG-laser tumor ablation or any other common, nonlaser endoscopic procedure. 
Comparison of restorative proctocolectomy with and without covering ileostomy in ulcerative colitis. The experience of restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis is reported in 16 consecutive patients with no covering ileostomy (group 2) in comparison with 15 patients with a covering stoma (group 1); in each group a J pouch was constructed. All patients had pre- and postoperative clinical and manometric evaluations of the functional result up to 12 months. There were no deaths or permanent failures. The number of early complications was four in each group. Re-ileostomy was needed in one patient of group 1, and an ileostomy was constructed in three patients of group 2. At 1 year after operation the functional results did not differ between groups 1 and 2 in terms of daily frequency of defaecation (mean 5.6 and 5.4 in 24 h respectively), or in terms of anal basal or maximal squeeze pressures. There was a significant (P less than 0.01) saving in total hospital stay (median 11 days) and in operating theatre time (mean 41 min) in patients with no covering ileostomy. It is concluded that a covering ileostomy may be unnecessary in restorative proctocolectomy, at least in suitable cases with no technical difficulty at the time of operation. 
Does the retrocecal position of the vermiform appendix alter the clinical course of acute appendicitis? A prospective analysis. Ninety-four adult patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis were prospectively studied during a 2-year period. Patients were divided into retrocecal (group 1; n = 27 [29%]) and anterior (group 2; n = 67 [71%]) groups according to the position of the appendix. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in duration of symptoms, presenting signs and symptoms, and initial white blood cell count. Furthermore, retrocecal appendicitis was not associated with a higher rate of perforation or increased morbidity. We conclude that the retrocecal position of the appendix does not alter the presentation of appendicitis. 
Paired comparisons of efficacy of intravenous and oral procainamide in patients with inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Thirty-eight patients who had inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia during baseline programmed electrical stimulation underwent electrophysiologic testing after both intravenous and oral administration of procainamide. Each had presented clinically with documented sustained ventricular tachycardia or out of hospital cardiac arrest not associated with acute myocardial infarction. In 23 patients (61%) (Group I) the arrhythmia became noninducible during an intravenous infusion of procainamide. Oral procainamide was subsequently administered and retesting was carried out after dose titration to match plasma concentration at the end of the intravenous study. Among the 23 patients in Group I the mean (+/- SD) plasma procainamide level was 7.2 +/- 2.8 micrograms/ml after intravenous dosing and 7.9 +/- 2.5 micrograms/ml after oral dosing (p = 0.09). In 15 (65%) of the 23 patients, sustained ventricular arrhythmia was inducible on oral therapy with comparable plasma procainamide levels (intravenous = 6.3 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml, oral = 7.5 +/- 2.1 micrograms/ml). The other eight patients (35%) had concordant responses to repeat testing with comparable intravenous (mean 9.0 +/- 3.3 micrograms/ml) and oral (8.8 +/- 3.1 micrograms/ml) plasma procainamide levels. In the additional 15 patients (Group II) sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia remained inducible on intravenous procainamide therapy and the patients were retested on oral therapy with similar plasma concentration (p = 0.05). In seven patients (47%) sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia was noninducible on treatment with oral procainamide (mean plasma level 7.6 +/- 2.7 micrograms/ml) after failure of intravenous procainamide (mean plasma level 10.3 +/- 2.3 micrograms/ml). 
Effect of risk status on treatment criteria. Implications of hypertension trials. When deciding whether to treat a patient with hypertension, clinicians must balance the benefit of treatment against its adverse effects. In the absence of an interaction, the multiplicative model of risk implies that the absolute benefit of treatment is related to the underlying risk of an adverse outcome. Thus, each additional risk factor multiplies the absolute benefit of treating hypertension. Analyses of data from subgroups in clinical trials of hypertension treatment suggest that this model is usually valid. In contrast, the adverse effects of treatment are usually unrelated to other risk factors. Thus, the cutoff point for treatment differs in different individuals: setting a single treatment threshold and goal for the entire population is not appropriate. Patients who are at high absolute risk because of prior coronary artery disease or other risk factors have a greater potential absolute benefit, and such patients deserve a low threshold and goal, such as a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg. Conversely, persons at low risk, such as white women without other risk factors, do not require such aggressive management. 
Virological investigations of acute encephalopathy in India A total of 740 consecutive children aged between 6 months and 12 years who presented with acute encephalopathic illnesses during a three year period were assessed both clinically and by laboratory investigations. Cerebrospinal fluid was examined for the presence of cells or other abnormal substances, and any organisms were cultured. Blood examination included white cell count and estimations of haemoglobin, urea, glucose, and electrolyte concentrations and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. A firm diagnosis was established in 278 patients (38%). Pyogenic meningitis (n = 134), measles encephalopathy (n = 38), and electrolyte imbalance (n = 23) were important causes in this group, cerebral malaria (n = 4) was uncommon and there were no cases of Reye's syndrome. The diagnoses of the remaining 462 were combined under the heading 'acute unexplained encephalopathy'. Altogether 394 of the 462 patients underwent virological investigations for arboviruses and 92 (23%) had one or more indicators of Japanese encephalitis. No other arboviruses could be isolated. Throat swabs from 187 patients with acute unexplained encephalopathy were studied on monkey kidney tissue cell lines of which 14 were positive (8%). These were identified as adenovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, poliomyelitis, Coxsackie, and echovirus; in two cases the virus was untypable. Japanese encephalitis is an important cause of acute childhood encephalopathy in this region. Clinical features of the illness may be mimicked by several disorders which require specific treatment. Thirty four of the 92 died (37%). 
Cladosporium trichoides cerebral phaeohyphomycosis in a liver transplant recipient. Report of a case. Cerebral phaeohyphomycosis (also referred to as cerebral chromomycosis), one of the diseases caused by the dematiaceous (black) fungi, is most commonly caused by Cladosporium trichoides (referred to by some as Xylohypha bantiana) and is a rare disease, with 31 culture-proven cases reported to date. Although most cases have occurred in immunocompetent hosts, recent experimental evidence suggests that host immunosuppression may predispose patients to the disease. The authors report a case of fatal cerebral phaeohyphomycosis in a liver transplant patient, the first to occur in a transplant patient of any type, to the best of the authors' knowledge. This case provides support for the hypothesis that immunosuppressed patients may be at increased risk for development of this disease. 
Endoprosthetic replacement for stage IIB osteosarcoma. Over an eight-year period, 100 patients with IIB osteosarcoma have been managed. Eighty-one were treated with limb-salvage procedures, 78 of which involved reconstruction utilizing endoprostheses. Only 19 patients received amputation as the primary treatment for local control. Since 1984, all patients received preoperative and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy. Those patients who received chemotherapy had a statistically significant improvement in five-year survival over those who did not (57% and 32%, respectively, p = 0.014). The functional results were good overall, with excellent results seen in distal femoral reconstruction. Twenty-eight of the 78 patients treated with endoprosthetic reconstruction experienced 30 complications (36%). Mechanical failure was the most common complication (10%) but was generally correctable. The local recurrence rate was 5% and the infection rate was 3%. Local complications were manageable. A statistical analysis revealed that the relative risk of patient death was 2.5 times higher than prosthesis failure for the 78 patients with endoprosthetic reconstruction. The intermediate-term results, with a median follow-up period of 43 months, remains encouraging. 
Quinapril: a new second-generation ACE inhibitor. Quinapril is a new non-sulfhydryl angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. The drug undergoes hepatic hydrolysis into its major active diacid metabolite, quinaprilat, and two minor inactive metabolites. On a weight basis quinaprilat is three times as potent an ACE inhibitor as quinapril. Approximately 60 percent of an oral dose of quinapril is absorbed. In contrast with captopril, the absorption of quinapril is unaffected by food. Peak serum concentrations of quinapril and quinaprilat are achieved within one and two hours, respectively. Approximately 61 percent of an orally administered dose is excreted in the urine, principally as quinaprilat. The elimination half-life of quinaprilat is three hours, but is prolonged up to 11 hours in patients with renal dysfunction. Quinapril dose reduction is recommended in patients with a creatinine clearance of 0.50 mL/sec or less. In the elderly the elimination of quinaprilat is reduced and correlates well with renal function. In patients with cirrhosis the hydrolysis of quinapril to quinaprilat is impaired resulting in lower plasma quinaprilat concentrations and up to a two-fold increase in quinapril half-life. Quinaprilat has a strong binding capacity to tissue ACE allowing for once-daily dosing. The recommended starting dose for quinapril is 20 mg/d. The nature and incidence of adverse reactions to quinapril are similar to those of enalapril and captopril. Quinapril's antihypertensive efficacy is equal to that of captopril and enalapril. A small number of patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) have been treated with quinapril. Preliminary data indicate that quinapril is an equally effective therapeutic alternative to presently available ACE inhibitors in the treatment of CHF. 
Astroviruses as a cause of nosocomial outbreaks of infant diarrhea. During a 16-month study period at a children's hospital, 32 children developed nosocomial gastroenteritis caused by astroviruses. Twenty-five of these occurred during 2 epidemic outbreaks in medical and surgical infants' wards. From the community, 13 confirmed cases were admitted during the study period. Both community-acquired and nosocomial cases occurred during autumn, winter and early spring. The attack rates during outbreaks ranged between 7 and 62% and were highest among children with underlying gastrointestinal diseases. Diarrhea and vomiting were the most common clinical manifestations. The median duration of symptoms was 4 days and that of virus excretion was 5 days. Hospital infection with astroviruses is common and usually affects children less than 2 years of age. The probable mode of transmission is spread via contaminated hands. 
Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be ineffective for secondary prevention of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic, average-risk men. Asymptomatic men (N = 114) 50 years of age or older had screening for colorectal neoplasia with flexible sigmoidoscopy followed by colonoscopy regardless of the sigmoidoscopic result. Our study objective was to determine the prevalence of patients having isolated adenomatous polyps in a proximal colonic segment in the absence of a distal index neoplasm within reach of the sigmoidoscope. Through the combined use of sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy, adenomatous polyps were detected in 47 of 114 individuals (41%). A total of 88 adenomas was found. Seventeen patients had isolated neoplasms in proximal colonic segments in the absence of distal adenomas. These patients represented 15% of screened subjects (17 of 114) and 20% of individuals who lacked adenomas on sigmoidoscopy (17 of 84). The majority of proximal neoplasms were small (less than 1.0 cm), tubular adenomas. Flexible sigmoidoscopy may be ineffective for screening asymptomatic men for neoplasia. However, it remains to be determined if a 20% miss rate (for those with a normal sigmoidoscopic examination) is significant and whether small proximal adenomas are worth finding. 
Gonadal vein thrombosis in patients with acute gastrointestinal inflammation: diagnosis with CT. During a 31-month period, evidence of gonadal vein thrombosis (GVT) was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) in seven patients who had a broad spectrum of acute gastrointestinal inflammatory lesions, including diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, appendicitis with abscess, and perforated appendix with pseudomembranous colitis. All patients had lower abdominal pain, tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis. CT demonstrated thrombus through the length of the gonadal vein in each patient; the entire lumen of the vein was filled. No symptoms relating to GVT were present. GVT may resolve with treatment of the underlying enteric disease alone, and anticoagulant therapy may not be necessary. 
Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography for diagnosis in chronic ischemic heart disease. Rest and exercise radionuclide angiography is frequently employed for the diagnosis of chest pain syndromes. Its value and limitations in this regard have been well studied, but proper utilization of the technique requires an understanding of five critical concepts: 1) Radionuclide angiography is superior to treadmill exercise testing and probably equivalent to thallium scintigraphy, although the published series did not use current methods. 2) The true specificity of radionuclide angiography is about 80%, intermediate between the early optimistic estimates and the later pessimistic ones. 3) The peak exercise ejection fraction is the preferred test parameter for diagnosis, although exercise hemodynamics, symptoms, and electrocardiographic changes should also be considered. 4) Although radionuclide angiography is clearly helpful for noninvasive diagnosis, significant numbers of patients will continue to fall in an uncertain category. 5) The proper application of the technique requires recognition of its limitations and careful attention to technical details. When properly applied, this modality can make an important contribution to clinical decision making. 
Serum bupivacaine concentrations following wound infiltration in children undergoing inguinal herniotomy. Serum bupivacaine concentrations were measured in 12 children who underwent elective herniotomy and who received analgesia in the form of wound infiltration. Mean (SD) peak concentration was 0.36 (0.14) micrograms/ml and time to peak concentration was 14.6 (7.2) minutes after infiltration of 1.25 mg/kg of bupivacaine. These concentrations are lower than those associated with other local anaesthetic blocks and well below potentially toxic levels. Wound infiltration provides a simple, effective and safe method of providing postoperative analgesia for hernia repair in children. 
Infections with Chryseomonas luteola (CDC group Ve-1) and Flavimonas oryzihabitans (CDC group Ve-2) in neurosurgical patients. During a 20-month period at Temple University Hospital, three cases of infection with bacteria of the Ve group--Chryseomonas luteola (CDC group Ve-1) and Flavimonas oryzihabitans (CDC group Ve-2)--were seen in neurosurgical patients. Two of the patients, including one with what is thought to be the first reported case of meningitis due to C. luteola, had complications caused by prosthetic material. A review of the literature revealed 14 well-described cases of infection with C. luteola or F. oryzihabitans, the majority of which were cases of bacteremia or peritonitis in patients undergoing dialysis. The presence of foreign material and the use of corticosteroids may predispose to and influence the course of disease. As prosthetic material becomes even more widely used, the incidence of infection with bacteria of the Ve group will likely increase and the manifestations of the infections will probably become more varied. 
Postirradiation sarcoma. Analysis of a nationwide cancer registry material. Thirty-three cases of postirradiation sarcoma (PIS) from the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry were analyzed. The most frequent first primary tumors were cancers of the breast (seven cases) and female reproductive organs (13 cases). Five patients had a childhood cancer. The median total radiation dose at the site of the PIS was 3600 cGy (1600 cGy to 11200 cGy). The median interval from start of radiation therapy to detection of PIS was 13.2 years (3.4 to 22.8 years). The PIS was of soft tissue origin in 25 of 33 cases. The most frequent histologic types were osteosarcoma (ten cases, including four extraskeletal tumors), malignant fibrous histiocytoma (ten cases), and fibrosarcoma (six cases). The overall crude 5-year survival rate was 29% (calculated from the start of treatment for PIS), and for patients initially treated with either radical surgery or combined marginal surgery and postoperative irradiation it was 67%. The authors conclude that there is a chance for cure for radically treated patients with postirradiation sarcoma that emphasizes the importance of regular long-term follow-up of cancer patients. 
Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies in childhood. I. Biochemical and morphologic investigations. During a 4-year period (1984 to 1988), 50 children referred with manifestations of central nervous system or neuromuscular disease combined with hyperlactatemia were subjected to investigations that aimed to identify and characterize children with mitochondrial disorders. Biochemical and morphologic investigations of quadriceps muscle biopsy tissue were done, including oximetric and spectrophotometric analysis of the respiratory chain function, enzyme histochemistry, electron microscopy, and analysis of mitochondrial DNA. A diagnosis of mitochondrial disease was based on the presence of at least two of five criteria: (1) abnormal results of oximetry, (2) abnormal results of spectrophotometry, (3) enzyme histochemical evidence of cytochrome x oxidase deficiency, (4) deletions or point mutations of mitochondrial DNA, and (5) abundant ultrastructurally abnormal mitochondria. With the combined biochemical and morphologic investigation, 20 of the children were found to have mitochondrial disorders. In an additional 10 children a mitochondrial disorder was neither excluded nor verified. Mitochondrial disorders are thus an important cause of central nervous system and neuromuscular disease in children with hyperlactatemia. 
Granulomatous peritonitis and appendicitis of food starch origin. Two patients with food starch granulomatous reactions, one a necrotising granulomatous peritonitis after the perforation of a gastric ulcer and the other a non-necrotising granulomatous appendicitis, are described. The possibility of food starch induced inflammation must be considered in the differential diagnosis of granulomatous diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. 
Effect of digitalis glycosides on norepinephrine release in the heart. Dual mechanism of action. The effect of ouabain on exocytotic and nonexocytotic norepinephrine release was investigated in perfused rat and guinea pig hearts. The overflow of endogenous norepinephrine and its neuronal metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethyleneglycol (DOPEG) was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. DOPEG served as the indicator of free axoplasmic norepinephrine concentrations. The overflow of the norepinephrine cotransmitter neuropeptide Y (NPY) was determined by radioimmunoassay and NPY was used as marker for exocytotic release. Electrical stimulation of the left stellate ganglion resulted in exocytotic norepinephrine release in rat and guinea pig hearts. Ouabain caused an increase in stimulation-induced norepinephrine overflow from rat and guinea pig hearts by 40%. However, overflow of NPY was decreased by 40%, indicating a reduced exocytosis rate. Ouabain increased both norepinephrine and NPY overflow, suggesting enhancement of exocytosis, when neuronal catecholamine uptake (uptake1) was blocked by desipramine or when presynaptic alpha 2-adrenoceptors were inhibited by yohimbine. The results demonstrate an interaction of ouabain with both calcium-dependent exocytosis and uptake1 of norepinephrine. Under calcium-free conditions, ouabain or potassium-free perfusate resulted in norepinephrine release from hearts when the axoplasmic norepinephrine concentration was elevated by the reserpinelike agent Ro 4-1284. This release was independent from neural activity, not accompanied by NPY overflow, and suppressed by the uptake1 blocker desipramine. These findings are in keeping with carrier-mediated nonexocytotic norepinephrine release that is caused by reversal of the transport direction of the uptake1 carrier. During myocardial ischemia nonexocytotic norepinephrine release was accelerated and enhanced by inhibition of Na+,K(+)-ATPase before ischemia. This study demonstrates the potential of digitalis glycosides to interact both with transmitter exocytosis and with the neuronal catecholamine transport system by Na+,K(+)-ATPase inhibition. Interaction with the catecholamine transport system involves both inhibition of norepinephrine inward transport and induction of norepinephrine outward transport, resulting in nonexocytotic norepinephrine release. 
Effects of dynamic cardiomyoplasty on left ventricular performance and myocardial mechanics in dilated cardiomyopathy. We tested the hypothesis that dynamic cardiomyoplasty produces beneficial changes in the functional mechanics of the dilated, failing left ventricle. Chronic dilated cardiomyopathy was induced in seven mongrel dogs by rapid ventricular pacing (260 beats/min) for 3 to 4 weeks. After completion of the induction period, dynamic cardiomyoplasty was performed with the left latissimus dorsi muscle, paced synchronously with the R waves of the electrocardiogram (Medtronic SP1005). Instruments included an aortic flow probe, a left ventricular Millar pressure catheter, and piezoelectric sonomicrometric crystals on the left ventricle for measurements of wall thickness and minor and major axis dimensions. Data were obtained with the stimulator off and on. Statistical comparisons were made with Student's t test for paired data. Dynamic cardiomyoplasty increased the cardiac output of the failing heart (966 +/- 124 versus 1166 +/- 112 ml/min; p less than 0.01). Systolic shortening of both minor and major axis dimensions increased (3.1 +/- 0.3 versus 4.7 +/- 0.3 mm, p less than 0.01, and 4.6 +/- 0.3 versus 7.3 +/- 0.9 mm, p less than 0.05, respectively). Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased by 16% (18 +/- 1 versus 15 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01). Although skeletal muscle contraction increased the pressure development in the left ventricular chamber, mean systolic wall stress was diminished by concomitant changes in left ventricular dimensions (116,144 +/- 11,530 versus 101,268 +/- 7464 dynes/cm2, p less than 0.05). At end-systole, wall thickness increased (11.8 +/- 1.1 versus 12.7 +/- 1.1 mm, p less than 0.01), minor axis dimension decreased (51.3 +/- 1.4 versus 49.2 +/- 1.8 mm, p less than 0.01), and major axis dimension also decreased (85.6 +/- 3.3 versus 79.0 +/- 2.3 mm, p less than 0.05). Our detailed evaluation of left ventricular chamber mechanics suggests that dynamic cardiomyoplasty may have a role in ameliorating the functional and mechanical derangements associated with progression of dilated cardiomyopathy both by augmenting cardiac performance and by diminishing determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption. (All values are expressed as mean +/- standard error of the mean.). 
Transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract: evaluation of prognostic factors by histopathology and flow cytometric analysis. Prognostic factors in transitional cell carcinoma of the upper urinary tract were assessed with histopathological examination and flow cytometric analysis in a series of 127 patients operated upon between 1976 and 1988. In particular, we evaluated the usefulness of flow cytometry to identify patients who require adjuvant treatment among those with low grade and low stage disease (51% in this series). A multivariate analysis was done on 92 cases, considering patient age and sex, stage, grade and number of lesions (unifocal versus multifocal), site (renal pelvis versus ureter), presence of vesical tumors, recurrences along the urinary tract or in the bladder, type of operation and nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) ploidy (diploid versus tetraploid/aneuploid tumors). Only the stage (p = 0.001), grade (p = 0.001) and, to a lesser extent, the DNA pattern (p = 0.031), as well as the number of lesions (p = 0.061) were determinant for prognosis. In regard to the subgroup of 41 patients with grade 2 or less, stage P1 or less tumors, no significant difference in survival was demonstrated between diploid and nondiploid tumor patients. However, 7 of 10 patients from the latter group are still under observation. Therefore, our conclusions may have to be modified in the future. 
Comparison of 40 milliliters of 0.25% intrapleural bupivacaine with epinephrine with 20 milliliters of 0.5% intrapleural bupivacaine with epinephrine after cholecystectomy. To determine the influence of the volume of local anesthetic injected for intrapleural analgesia, 40 patients undergoing cholecystectomy were randomly allocated to two groups of 20 patients each. One group received 40 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with epinephrine injected intrapleurally postoperatively. The other group received 20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine with epinephrine. The onset time of analgesia was nearly the same in both groups and within 25 min all patients were nearly pain free. Our data demonstrate that 100 mg of bupivacaine with epinephrine elicits effective analgesia after cholecystectomy. There are only minor differences between 20 and 40 mL with regard to pain relief. The authors conclude that the volume of local anesthetic within the range of 20-40 mL in an adult has little influence on the extent or duration of intrapleural analgesia. 
Acute catastrophic complications of balloon aortic valvuloplasty. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. Among the initial 492 patients who underwent balloon aortic valvuloplasty as part of the Mansfield Investigational Device Exemption Protocol, 31 (6.3%) had acute catastrophic complications. These included ventricular perforation in nine (1.8%), seven women and two men; six cases (67%) involved serial balloon inflations and seven (78%) also involved dual balloon inflations. In six (67%) of the nine patients perforation was fatal. In four patients studied at necropsy, the perforation involved the base of the lateral left ventricular free wall. Pericardiocentesis was performed in five patients, three of whom survived with (one patient) or without (two patients) operative repair. Acute, severe aortic regurgitation developed in four patients (0.8%), all women. None had significant regurgitation before valvuloplasty; dual balloons were used in two of the four. All three patients who underwent emergency valve replacement survived. A fourth patient died 2 days after valvuloplasty without operative intervention. Fatal cardiac arrest complicated balloon aortic valvuloplasty in 13 patients (2.6%), including 7 with cardiogenic shock and 4 with refractory ventricular arrhythmias. Of the seven with shock, four had been treated with serial balloon inflations; dual balloons were used in three. In two of three patients studied at necropsy, the aortic valve was observed to be congenitally bicuspid. A fatal cerebrovascular accident occurred in two patients (0.4%); it was hemorrhagic in one, embolic in another. Both patients were treated with serial (including one dual) balloon inflations. Limb amputation was required in three patients (0.6%), two women and one man; in two patients amputation was above the knee, in the third patient it was limited to two toes. 
Early heparin therapy in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage. In 68 patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage the effect of heparin treatment beginning on the second, fourth or tenth day was investigated. Early (day 2) low-dose heparin medication significantly lowered the incidence of pulmonary embolism. An increase in the number of patients with rebleeding was not observed. The results indicate that the early use of heparin in these patients is safe and can be recommended for the prevention of thromboembolic complications. 
Maple syrup urine disease. Complete defect of the E1 beta subunit of the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex due to a deletion of an 11-bp repeat sequence which encodes a mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in a family with the disease. Branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) deficiency results in maple syrup urine disease (MSUD). We examined the molecular basis of familial cases of MSUD by analyzing the activity, subunit structure, mRNA sequence, and genome structure of the affected enzyme. The BCKDH activity in the proband with MSUD was approximately 6% of the normal control level. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH was absent and that the E1 alpha subunit of BCKDH was markedly reduced. We amplified the cDNAs of the E1 alpha subunit and the E1 beta subunit of the BCKDH complex obtained from cells of the patient, using the polymerase chain reaction method, then sequenced the amplified cDNAs. The deduced amino acid sequence for the E1 alpha subunit of the patient's cell was normal. An 11-bp deletion was identified in the region that encoded the mitochondrial targeting leader peptide in the E1 beta cDNA. This 11-bp sequence is found in the first exon of the BCKDH-E1 beta gene, as a direct tandem repeat. Amplification of genomic DNA revealed that the consanguineous parents were heterozygous for this mutant allele, and sister and brother of the patient with the disease were homozygous for this mutant allele. This 11-bp deletion mutation caused a change in the reading frame and the mature E1 beta protein was defective. These observations show the biological importance of the E1 beta subunit of BCKDH to maintain normal function of the enzyme activity. The absence of the E1 beta subunit results in instability of the E1 alpha subunit. 
Injury of the Achilles tendon: diagnosis with sonography. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of sonography for the assessment of injury to the Achilles tendon. After anatomic investigations in three human cadavers, we performed a clinical study in 24 healthy volunteers and 73 symptomatic patients referred for achillodynia or signs of heel thickening or both in whom a clinical diagnosis of acute total rupture was excluded. High-resolution real-time sonography was performed and the results were compared with final clinical diagnoses (55 patients) and surgical findings (18 patients). Fifty-two of the patients had been involved in various sporting activities (long-distance runners, jumpers, and basketball players), three patients had familial hypercholesterolemia, five patients had systemic inflammatory disease, and 13 patients had no known underlying cause. Anatomic investigation demonstrated accurate assessment of tendon structure and thickness. Sonograms were abnormal in 53 patients (sensitivity, 0.72; specificity, 0.83), and the extent of structural disorders of the tendon could be assessed properly. Abnormalities occurred in the form of tendon swelling (45%), abnormal tendon structure (42%), rupture (15%), and peritendinous lesions (47%). No changes were detected in low-grade disease of short duration, which suggests symptoms caused by functional disorders. Sonography is valuable in the diagnosis of various lesions of the Achilles tendon and its surrounding tissue. Furthermore, it can be used to estimate the degree of tendon abnormality and to differentiate between functional and morphologic conditions. 
Quantitative thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography during maximal pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with adenosine for assessing coronary artery disease. The diagnostic value of maximal pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with intravenously administered adenosine in conjunction with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of coronary artery disease was investigated in 101 consecutive patients who had concomitant coronary arteriography. Tomographic images were assessed visually and from computer-quantified polar maps of the thallium-201 distribution. Significant coronary artery disease, defined as greater than 50% luminal diameter stenosis, was present in 70 patients. The sensitivity for detecting patients with coronary artery disease using quantitative analysis was 87% in the total group, 82% in patients without myocardial infarction and 96% in those with prior myocardial infarction; the specificity was 90%. The sensitivity for diagnosing coronary artery disease in patients without infarction with single-, double-and triple-vessel disease was 76%, 86% and 90%, respectively. All individual stenoses were identified in 68% of patients with double-vessel disease and in 65% of those with triple-vessel disease. The extent of the perfusion defects, as quantified by polar maps, was directly related to the extent of coronary artery disease. In conclusion, quantitative thallium-201 SPECT during adenosine infusion has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing the presence of coronary artery disease, localizing the anatomic site of coronary stenosis and identifying the majority of affected vascular regions in patients with multivessel involvement. 
Nursing and public policy. What is the high ground? To be effective in public policy formation, nurses must establish standards of care and advocate changes in financing and healthcare organization for persons who are not well served. The author delineates four areas (out-of-hospital prenatal and postnatal care; care of chronically mentally ill adults and severely emotionally disturbed youths; care for the elderly, especially in nursing homes; and care of the disabled and the chronically and terminally ill) where nurses should be the authority for much of the care provided. The author concludes that evolving dissatisfaction with the healthcare system means that nurses have the opportunity to make major contributions to the organization of all parts of the system, as it is ultimately put together, if they do the research and advocacy that is needed. 
Selection criteria for successful immediate breast reconstruction. To evaluate the factors leading to success in immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy, 176 consecutive immediate reconstructions done with implants or expanders over a 5-year period were analyzed. None of these 176 had "complete muscle coverage." There were only five failures: four with implant loss (one involving radiation) and one removed electively. The failures were 1 in 40 regular implants, 4 in 77 temporary expanders, and 0 in 59 long-term expanders. There is no other report in the literature comparing these different types of implants. Various hypotheses for failure are reviewed. It is concluded that failure in immediate reconstruction is not related to use of drains, bilaterality, or lack of "complete muscle coverage." It is concluded that failure is related to implant type, prior radiation, and most of all to suboptimal patient selection. Specific selection criteria and operative techniques are discussed. 
Role of anteroventral third ventricle and vasopressin in renal response to stress in borderline hypertensive rats. The borderline hypertensive rat is the first filial offspring of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Wistar-Kyoto rat. In response to acute environmental stress (air jet), the borderline hypertensive rat exhibits a diuretic response, whereas the parental strains exhibit an antidiuretic response (spontaneously hypertensive rat) or no change in urine flow rate (Wistar-Kyoto rat). This study sought to investigate the role of the periventricular tissue surrounding the anteroventral third ventricle and vasopressin release in the diuretic response of the borderline hypertensive rat to acute environmental stress. Sixteen-week-old borderline hypertensive rats who had consumed a 1% NaCl diet for 10-12 weeks were given either electrolytic lesions of the anteroventral portion of the third ventricle or sham lesions. When exposed to acute environmental stress 4 weeks later, the increase in volume of dilute urine seen in the sham-lesion rats was not observed in the lesion rats. Plasma vasopressin concentration was decreased by acute environmental stress in the sham-lesion rats (15.2 +/- 4.0 to 10.9 +/- 1.7 pg/ml, p less than 0.05) but was unchanged in the lesion rats (12.3 +/- 2.0 to 13.4 +/- 4.0 pg/ml). In a separate group of intact borderline hypertensive rats, a constant intravenous infusion of vasopressin prevented the diuretic response to acute environmental stress. The results suggest that acute environmental stress produces a diuresis in the borderline hypertensive rats via a decrease in plasma vasopressin concentration that is dependent on the integrity of the periventricular tissue of the anteroventral portion of the third ventricle. 
Endocardial fibroelastosis in infants with hydrops fetalis. Endocardial fibroelastosis, defined as an endocardium in excess of 30 microns thick, was found in 10 out of 34 cases of hydrops fetalis in a review of 1589 perinatal necropsies carried out between 1976 and 1989. The infants comprised 16 cases of rhesus haemolytic disease, of whom three had endocardial fibroelastosis, and 18 cases of non-rhesus hydrops, of whom seven had endocardial fibroelastosis. Intrauterine congestive heart failure was thought to have been the probable cause of hydrops in eight of the 10 infants with endocardial fibroelastosis. None of an age matched control group without endocardial fibroelastosis had evidence of congestive cardiac failure. These observations support the hypothesis that endocardial fibroelastosis is an endocardial response to chronic prenatal myocardial stress. 
Inspiratory muscle dysfunction and chronic hypercapnia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease A prospective evaluation of the prevalence of CO2 retention and its relationship to lung mechanics and inspiratory muscle strength was carried out in 311 clinically stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Of these patients 32.8% had hypercapnia (PaCO2 greater than or equal to 43 mm Hg). PaCO2 was directly related to lung resistance (RL; r = 0.53) and inversely related to FEV1 (r = 0.53) and to an expression of the dead space/tidal volume ratio (1 - VD/VT) (r = 0.48). RL was found to be a major determinant of the mean intrathoracic pressure swing developed during inspiration (PI) at rest (r = 0.85). Maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) was found to improve the predictive value for PaCO2 of several mechanical loads, with RL/PImax the best predictor (r = 0.57). The prevalence of hypercapnia increased from virtually 0 to 100% with increases in the RL/PImax value and was higher in the obese subjects at intermediate RL/PImax values, probably because of the burden placed on the respiratory muscles by chest wall mass loading. Our results show that chronic alveolar hypoventilation is likely to develop in COPD patients who have a combination of high inspiratory loads and inspiratory muscle weakness. hypercapnia may be one strategy available to avoid overloading of the inspiratory muscles leading to fatigue and possible irreversible failure. 
Evaluation of light microscopy to localise the site of haematuria. Red cell morphology was examined by light microscopy in 122 urine specimens from 99 patients with haematuria in an attempt to define the site of origin. Altogether 84% of glomerular bleeding and 91% of non-glomerular bleeding was correctly assigned according to diagnoses determined by renal biopsy in 51 patients and clinically in 48. The test should be interpreted with caution as both false positive and false negative results were observed, some in the same individual with unchanged pathology at different times. No advantage of phase contrast over bright field microscopy was apparent even when examining uncentrifuged urines. 
Relative predispositional effects (RPEs) of marker alleles with disease: HLA-DR alleles and Graves disease. A method is described to reveal the relative predispositional effects (RPEs) (predisposing, protective, or neutral) of the HLA alleles or of any other marker system that is associated with a disease. When the disease is associated with two or more alleles of a locus, the RPE method identifies the associations sequentially according to their strength; thus the problem that a strong association with one allele can create misleading deviations in the frequencies of other alleles is alleviated. Using this method, we have examined the relative effects of HLA-DR alleles in susceptibility to Graves disease in the Caucasian population. The well-established positive association with DR3 was confirmed as the strongest effect. In addition, a negative association was found between DR5 and Graves disease. The reduced frequency of DR5 among patients is statistically significant and is not a result of the increase in DR3. Finally, when patients were divided according to the presence or absence of eye disease, the latter showed a significant increase in the frequency of DR4. With family data, linkage to HLA of Graves disease was established in both Caucasian and Chinese families by the sib-pair method. 
Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric carcinoma among Japanese Americans in Hawaii BACKGROUND. Helicobacter pylori are gram-negative spiral bacteria that are associated with chronic gastritis, a known precursor of gastric carcinoma. Persons at high risk for gastric carcinoma have been shown to have a high prevalence of H. pylori infection. METHODS. We studied the relation of H. pylori infection and gastric carcinoma in a cohort of Japanese American men living in Hawaii. The 5908 men were enrolled and examined from 1967 to 1970. By 1989, 109 cases of pathologically confirmed gastric carcinoma had been identified. The store serum of each patient with gastric carcinoma and of each matched control subject were tested for the presence of serum IgG antibody to H. pylori. RESULTS. Ninety-four percent of the men with gastric carcinoma and 76 percent of the matched control subjects had a positive test for H. pylori antibodies, for an odds ratio of 6.0 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 17.3). As the level of antibody to H. pylori increased, there was a progressive increase in the risk of gastric carcinoma (P for trend = 0.0009). The association was strong even for men in whom the diagnosis was made 10 or more years after the serum sample was obtained (odds ratio, 10.5; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.5 to 44.8). CONCLUSIONS. Infection with H. pylori is strongly associated with an increased risk of gastric carcinoma. However, most persons infected with H. pylori will never have gastric carcinoma. Therefore, other factors that increase the risk of gastric carcinoma among persons infected with H. pylori need to be identified. 
Intracranial vascular abnormalities: value of MR phase imaging to distinguish thrombus from flowing blood. The interpretation of conventional spin-echo and gradient-echo MR images of intracranial vascular lesions can be complex and ambiguous owing to variable effects on image intensity caused by flowing blood or thrombus. MR phase images, obtained simultaneously with conventional-magnitude images, are useful for evaluating proton motion (i.e., blood flow), and therefore can simplify the diagnosis of the presence or absence of thrombosis within a vascular structure or lesion. Fourteen patients with a variety of intracranial vascular abnormalities (aneurysms, superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, neoplasms adjacent to venous sinuses, and vascular malformations) were evaluated with conventional MR and phase imaging for the presence of blood flow. The phase images correlated with angiography in all cases. Phase imaging was not necessarily better than conventional spin-echo imaging in all cases, but it simplified the evaluation of thrombus vs blood flow in many. In three of five aneurysms, the phase images were diagnostic for evaluating lumen patency whereas the conventional images were ambiguous. Phase imaging was advantageous for detecting tumor invasion of the venous sinus when venous blood was enhanced by gadopentetate dimeglumine. A laminar flow phantom experiment determined the lower limits of sensitivity of phase imaging to be 0.5 cm/sec in the slice-select and 2.5 cm/sec in the read gradient directions. Phase imaging is a simple, reliable technique that can distinguish thrombosis from flowing blood within intracranial lesions. It is easily performed and adds no additional time to the MR examination. 
A behavioral taxonomy of obese female participants in a weight-loss program. To create a behavioral classification of obesity, 2-wk baseline food diaries were obtained from 236 obese women entering weight-loss programs. Subjects monitored food intake along with the social, environmental, and emotional context in which each meal occurred. Variables representing situation-specific eating behaviors were statistically extracted from greater than 11,000 eating episodes. Hierarchical cluster analysis identified five distinct groups of subjects on the basis of similarity of eating patterns. The five groups were (1) moderately healthy eating habits, (2) chronic food restrictors, (3) alternating diet-binge eaters, (4) emotional overeaters, (5) unrestricted meal overeaters. The five groups differed on questionnaire measures of emotional adjustment and eating behavior but did not differ on dropout rates, amount of weight lost, or exercise compliance. The chronic food restrictors had significantly less lean body mass, lower resting metabolic rates, and higher waist-to-hip ratios than did the unrestricted meal overeaters. 
Economic impact of diagnosis-related groups and severity of illness on reimbursement for central nervous system infections. Because the federal government's diagnosis-related group (DRG) classification system for prospective payment has not been widely applied to hospitalized pediatric patients, we analyzed the effectiveness of one DRG category (central nervous system infections) for a single year at a medium-sized children's hospital to control for patients' severity of illness and for hospital reimbursement. Several independent measures of severity of illness (length of stay, duration of fever, Physiologic Severity Index) showed that patients with bacterial meningitis and those with encephalitis (DRG 20) were more ill than those with aseptic meningitis (DRG 21) (p less than 0.001 for each measure). Cost analysis revealed that the hospital was only partially reimbursed for its charges (shortfall of $95,547) and that patients with Medicaid or no insurance accounted for 22% of discharges but 88% of losses. Reimbursement by DRG would have increased payment for DRG 21 but decreased that for DRG 20. If DRGs were applied to pediatric central nervous system infections and used in a prospective payment system, they would accurately predict disease severity between but not within groups, and significant financial losses for children's hospitals would still occur. 
Acute thrombosis of the renal transplant artery: a case report and review of the literature. Acute thrombosis of the renal transplant artery is a known but unusual complication of renal transplantation usually occurring in the first month. Reported here is a case of acute renal artery thrombosis in a well functioning long-term renal allograft in which there was clear angiographic evidence of a normal renal artery two years earlier. 
Lateral rhachotomy for thoracic spinal lesions. Capener's "Lateral Rhachotomy" was modified by additional excision of the pedicle, articular facets, part of the lamina, and a posterior half of the vertebral bodies on one side through a transpleural approach to the thoracic spine, and a retroperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine. The aim was to excise a space-occupying lesion, which exists in front of the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord, safely. This modification enable the authors to expose more than 50% of the spinal canal, and decompress it from its anterior, lateral, and posterior compressing mass. The utmost important point of this procedure is the excision of the lesion under the direct visualization of the dura. In ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), the dura is usually indented by the thick bony mass, and the lesion extends over a few segment with adhesion. Using "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy," it was possible to explore three or four vertebral levels in continuity through the same skin incision. In the present report, the authors described their "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy" procedure, and reviewed the case material. 
Peripheral mucoepidermoid tumour of the lung. Mucoepidermoid tumours of the bronchial tree are uncommon neoplasms, which are believed to arise from terminal ducts of the proximal tracheobronchial tree. The first case of a peripheral mucoepidermoid tumour of the lung is reported. 
Mitral valve repair in the extensively calcified mitral valve annulus. Mitral valve replacement in patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus is associated with an increased risk of ventricular rupture. Until now techniques of mitral valve repair have not been applied to patients with a heavily calcified mitral valve annulus. We present 12 patients who underwent extensive decalcification of the annulus with subsequent mitral valve repair between 1987 and 1990. Ages ranged from 11 to 78 years; 6 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class II, 4 were in class III, and 2 were in class IV. All patients had varying degrees of mitral insufficiency. There were no deaths, reoperations, or thromboembolic events. Postoperative echocardiography revealed minimal residual mitral insufficiency in only 2 of 12 patients. All patients are currently in New York Heart Association class I or II. We believe mitral valve repair can be done safely on patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus, thus avoiding the risks of left ventricular rupture, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhagic complications associated with mitral valve replacement. 
Efficacy of danazol in the control of hormonal migraine. Of 131 women with hormonally related migraines unresponsive to standard medication, 67 (51.1%) noted profound relief after a 12-month, phased study using danazol for migraine prevention. The first three phases consisted of two-month cycles: dietary control and acetazolamide, the addition of danazol and danazol discontinuation. Eighty-three women (63.36%) reported control of their hormonal migraines while using danazol. In phase IV, 81 women whose headaches were controlled by danazol restarted danazol for an additional six months. Sixty-seven (82.7%) reported continued success with this medication. Danazol proved highly successful in the control of women's cyclic migraine. Its effectiveness remained consistent throughout the treatment course. In the prophylactic treatment of women's hormonal migraine, 400 mg of danazol administered daily for 25 days each month can prove effective when standard medical therapy fails. Furthermore, the response to danazol supported the concept that hormonal migraine should be treated as a distinct clinical entity. 
Orientation and moment arms of some trunk muscles. The orientations and moment arms of nine trunk muscles: latissimus dorsi, iliocostalis, longissimus dorsi, obliquii, rectus and transversalis abdominis, quadratus lumborum, and iliopsoas were obtained on embalmed specimens. Each muscle was considered as one or several, linear or curvilinear, lines of action. Origins, insertions, and points along the length of main bundles were digitized for each muscle using a three-dimensional digitizer. The results obtained from seven male specimens are presented and will permit more refined biomechanical models. 
Prophylaxis of nasolacrimal duct obstruction after major sinus surgery using a silicone stent. Damage to the nasolacrimal duct during major sinus procedures results in troublesome symptoms of epiphora and acute infection. Prophylactic stenting of the lacrimal apparatus using a silicone stent is described as a means of preventing such complications. 
Renal disease, epidermal necrosis, and epithelial cell antibodies. OBJECTIVE--To describe the association between epithelial cell IgM, which has previously been associated with an increased incidence of loss of renal graft in children, with a novel cutaneous eruption and unexplained native renal disease. DESIGN--Observational study on children with epithelial cell antibody presenting with unexplained renal or skin disease. SETTING--General paediatric department and regional paediatric nephrology unit. PATIENTS--Six children (five girls, one boy), who presented to the unit in 1989-90. RESULTS--Three children, two of whom had a history of a hyperpigmented rash, presented with hypertension, proteinuria, and impaired renal function. Renal biopsy specimens from two of these children showed severe arteriolar endothelial cell swelling with arteriolar occlusion. These children fully recovered after treatment with antihypertensive drugs. The third child developed end stage renal failure and required dialysis. Three other children presented with an unusual cutaneous eruption but no evidence of renal disease. Histology of the skin lesions showed acute epidermal necrosis and features consistent with a viral infection. CONCLUSIONS--The aetiology and pathogenesis of the epithelial cell antibody are unknown. These cases indicate that it may have a role in native kidney disease and focal epidermal necrosis. Clinical and histological features suggest that the antibody may be associated with a viral infection. 
Placement of an ileal loop urinary diversion back in continuity with the intestinal tract. The use of ileum from a previously constructed urinary conduit for lengthening the small bowel has not been previously reported. We describe a patient with the short-bowel syndrome from previous small-bowel resections, radiation enteritis, and an ileal urinary diversion. The ileal conduit was revised because of recurrent hyperammonemic encephalopathy and apparent stricture of the ureteroenteric anastomosis. In an attempt to increase intestinal length, the ileal conduit was replaced by a colon conduit and the ileum was placed back in continuity with the intestinal tract. The patient had an uneventful recovery, and her chronic diarrhea, nutritional deficiencies, and metabolic derangements resolved. The ileal loop segment regained a normal intestinal appearance on radiographic studies. We suggest that when revision of an ileal urinary diversion is required restoration of the ileum into the intestinal tract may be of particular benefit to patients with the short-bowel syndrome. 
Screening for unruptured asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms in patients undergoing coronary angiography. In screening for unruptured asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms, an intracranial intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA), posteroanterior view, was obtained in 72 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography for workup of angina pectoris. In cases where an aneurysm was suspected from IA-DSA, conventional intracranial angiography was obtained. Five asymptomatic unruptured aneurysms were detected in four of these cases. The aneurysms ranged from 4 to 16 mm in diameter. There were no complications associated with the coronary angiography nor with the additional intracranial IA-DSA, which required less than 5 minutes to perform in all cases. The value of performing intracranial IA-DSA in patients undergoing coronary angiography to screen for unruptured asymptomatic aneurysm is discussed, as is the possible racial differences in the frequency of aneurysms. 
Effect of omeprazole on duodenal ulcer-associated antral gastritis and Helicobacter pylori. This study set out to investigate the effects of omeprazole or ranitidine on the progression of antral gastritis and Helicobacter pylori in patients with active duodenal ulcer. A double-blind, double-dummy trial was performed in 270 patients, 241 of whom were studied histologically for the presence of H. pylori. Patients were randomized to receive omeprazole, 10 mg every morning, omeprazole, 20 mg every morning, or ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day, for four weeks. Endoscopy was performed on entry and at weekly intervals during the study; at least two antral biopsies were taken on each occasion to assess the activity and degree of chronic inflammation, as reflected by the degree of polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration and mononuclear cell infiltration, respectively. Biopsy specimens also were assessed histologically for H. pylori. The sex, age and maximal acid output were comparable in the three treatment groups. The percentages of patients showing an improvement in the activity of gastritis in the four consecutive weeks of treatment were 9%, 40%, 51%, and 53% for omeprazole, 10 mg (N = 78); 14%, 42%, 49%, and 53% for omeprazole, 20 mg (N = 81); and 2%, 23%, 30%, and 33% for ranitidine, 150 mg twice a day (N = 82) (life table analysis gave P less than 0.01 for both omeprazole regimens compared with ranitidine). The degree of chronic inflammation showed similar changes. The density of H. pylori decreased significantly after treatment with omeprazole, 10 mg or 20 mg, (both, P less than 0.00001) but not with ranitidine. 
Amplified expression of three jun family members inhibits erythroleukemia differentiation. Several different proto-oncogenes have been shown to influence cellular differentiation. One of the most widely studied model systems has been the Friend murine erythroleukemia cell (F-MELC) line, which can be induced to undergo erythroid differentiation by a variety of chemical agents. Constitutive overexpression of either the c-myc or c-myb proto-oncogenes has been previously shown to inhibit F-MELC differentiation, whereas c-myc antisense sequences accelerate the process. To investigate the potential involvement of other proto-oncogenes and immediate early response genes in F-MELC differentiation, we studied the expression of the three known members of the jun family as well as another gene, egr-1, which, like the jun family members, is expressed as an immediate early response gene in growth factor-stimulated quiescent cells. All four genes were expressed in F-MELC, although the levels of expression and modes of regulation differed. Transfection with amplifiable c-jun, junB, or junD expression plasmids inhibited differentiation, whereas transfection with an egr-1 expression plasmid was without effect. These results indicate that jun family members play a role in mediating F-MELC differentiation. The known inhibitory effect of phorbol ester tumor promoters on F-MELC differentiation may be the result of their known stimulation of jun expression. 
Histological study of white blood cells and their association with lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulceration. The number of white blood cells per mm2 has been determined in serial histological slides taken from punch biopsies of skin from the goiter region in patients with varicose veins. In eight patients the varicose veins were complicated by lipodermatosclerosis of the skin, and in a further six there was a history of ulceration. In uncomplicated varicose veins there was a median of 6 white blood cells per mm2, in patients with lipodermatosclerosis there were 45 white blood cells per mm2, and where there was a history of ulceration, 217 white blood cells per mm2. No change in white blood cell content was observed after the venous pressure was raised for 30 min by sitting the patient with the lower limb dependent. White blood cell infiltration of the skin is associated with lipodermatosclerotic changes caused by venous insufficiency. 
Fatal varicella in an adult: case report and review of the gastrointestinal complications of chickenpox. An unusual and fatal case of primary varicella in an adult is presented. Involvement of the small intestine first manifested as abdominal pain and later progressed to gastrointestinal bleeding with subsequent dissemination of the infection. Although it has previously been speculated that gastrointestinal bleeding can result from infection with the varicella-zoster virus, the data from this case include histologic and cultural evidence that supports the clinical observations. The literature has been reviewed, and the management of this patient has been critically evaluated. 
Neurocutaneous melanosis: definition and review of the literature. Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare congenital syndrome characterized by the presence of large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi and benign or malignant pigment cell tumors of the leptomeninges. The syndrome is thought to represent an error in the morphogenesis of the embryonal neuroectoderm. We review 39 reported cases of neurocutaneous melanosis and propose revised criteria for diagnosis. Most patients with neurocutaneous melanosis presented in the first 2 years of life with neurologic manifestations of increased intracranial pressure, mass lesions, or spinal cord compression. Leptomeningeal melanoma was present in 62% of the cases, but even in the absence of melanoma, symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis had an extremely poor prognosis. Useful diagnostic procedures include cerebrospinal fluid cytology and magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast. Patients may be aided by palliative measures such as shunt placement to reduce intracranial pressure. Dermatologists in their follow-up of patients with large or multiple congenital melanocytic nevi should be aware of this condition, to aid in prompt diagnosis and because the treatment of cutaneous lesions may be altered in the presence of symptomatic neurocutaneous melanosis. 
Detection of human T-cell leukemia virus type I proviral sequences from fixed tissues of seropositive patients. Fixed lymphoma tissues from 11 patients seropositive for human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) antibodies were analyzed for proviral sequences by the polymerase chain reaction. Typical adult T-cell leukemia/lymphomas (ATLLs) from nine patients were positive for HTLV-I sequences. In contrast, one of two lymphomas with immunophenotypes atypical for ATLL was negative for HTLV-I. This HTLV-I DNA-negative lymphoma, although present in an HTLV-I-seropositive patient, was therefore reclassified. The HTLV-I tax gene was always detected in the ATLL tissues, whereas segments of the pol gene were not detected in half the cases. These studies demonstrate that fixed non-ATLL specimens can be distinguished from ATLL specimens. 
"Ex vivo" release of eicosanoid from human brain tissue: its relevance in the development of brain edema. The specific mechanism underlying the genesis of vasogenic brain edema is still debated: the role of arachidonic acid is considered extremely important, as it is a possible activator of self-maintaining reactions enhancing the release of vasoactive and cytotoxic compounds. The relationship between arachidonic acid metabolism and brain edema has been studied primarily in brain tissue samples or in the extracellular fluid, whereas the residual capacity of perilesional tissue to synthesize and release eicosanoids has not been investigated. In the present study, perilesional samples of brain tissue were available from 4 patients operated on for brain metastasis, from 8 patients who had malignant neuroepithelial tumors, from 4 with meningiomas, and from 5 with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A brain edema index was calculated from the preoperative computed tomographic scan. The "ex vivo" method allowed determination of the residual capacity of endogenous arachidonic acid metabolism. The edema index is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis (6.5 +/- 0.8) and neuroepithelial tumors (3.6 +/- 0.2) than in those with meningiomas (1.5 +/- 0.06), subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.7 +/- 0.18), and in controls. In patients with metastatic and neuroepithelial tumors there is a significant correlation between peritumoral brain edema and the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 (P less than 0.05); the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 is also significantly elevated after subarachnoid hemorrhage (13.91 +/- 2.6 ng/ml of incubation medium) when compared with control cases (5.56 +/- 0.91). The capacity to synthesize prostacyclin is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis than in those with neuroepithelial tumors and meningiomas (P less than 0.05). 
Bacterial invasion of the biliary system by way of the portal-venous system. It has been suggested that bacteria in the intestine gain access into the biliary tract by entering the portal-venous blood. We have tested the hypothesis of hematogenous infection of the biliary system in cats. The animals were treated in three different groups: group A (no biliary obstruction), group B (acute biliary obstruction) and group C (chronic biliary obstruction). A mutant strain of Escherichia coli was infused into the splenic vein of cats at three different dosages (10(7), 10(5) and 10(3) with sham controls. In the unobstructed biliary system, the mutant E. coli was isolated from the bile 30 min and 90 min after the infusion of 10(7) and 10(5) E. coli, respectively. No bacteria were found in the bile with the infusion of 10(3) E. coli and in the control animals. Bile flow was significantly reduced with the infusion of bacteria. The biliary excretion of E. coli in group B was similar to that in group A. In group C, the bile output in the first hour was very high but declined rapidly. E. coli was excreted into the bile at all three dosages of infusion after 30 min. Histological sections of the liver showed that the infused bacteria entered the sinusoidal blood and that some were phagocytosed by Kupffer cells. The portal-venous blood was considered an important route of bacterial invasion into the biliary system, and the penetration of bacteria was facilitated in biliary obstruction. 
Pediatric musculoskeletal MR imaging. In a review of the indications and uses for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the pediatric musculoskeletal system, MR evaluation of conditions unique to the pediatric musculoskeletal system were emphasized. Indications for MR imaging of the pediatric musculoskeletal system include evaluation of bone marrow, neoplastic processes, and periarticular disorders. 
Limitations of balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis. Vein graft stenosis remains an important contributing factor to the failure of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction. Repair of these lesions before graft occlusion provides sustained patency, yet the optimal method of repair has not been established. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of these vein graft lesions has been repeatedly advocated as an alternative to surgical revision. Balloon angioplasty was used in 30 patients with 54 stenotic lesions occurring in autogenous vein grafts after infrainguinal reconstruction. The primary 5-year cumulative patency rate was 18% overall, with no significant differences observed among patency rates based on initial indication, length of stenotic lesion, or requirement for preliminary thrombolytic therapy. The 3-year patency rate associated with vein graft lesions requiring only a single angioplasty proved significantly higher (59%) than those requiring repetitive dilations (6%). It is our conclusion that balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis has significant limitations in providing sustained secondary patency. 
Immunohistochemical expression of carbohydrate antigen 19-9 in gastric carcinoma. Immunohistochemical localization for carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) was studied in the gastric tissues from 115 patients with advanced gastric carcinoma. We compared two groups: 57 patients who died of recurrence or metastases within 2 yr (group I) and 58 patients who survived 5 yr or more after resection (group II). The staining patterns were classified into negative, apical, and/or cytoplasmic type and stromal type. Thirty-three cases (58%) of group I showed a stromal type, whereas only 17 cases (30%) of group II showed the same type. In undifferentiated type carcinoma, the stromal type was seen in 20 cases (65%) of group I and seven cases (23%) of group II. However, in differentiated type carcinoma, there was only a small difference in the appearance of stromal type between group I (50%) and group II (37%). The immunohistochemical localization for CA19-9 in the tumor tissues, particularly in undifferentiated carcinoma, will be useful in predicting the prognosis of the patients with advanced gastric carcinoma. 
Stomal recurrence after laryngectomy: interrelated risk factor study. This study was designed to identify pathogenic factors in recurrent carcinoma at the tracheal stoma. The charts of 444 patients with laryngeal cancer who were treated surgically between 1976 and 1988 revealed stomal recurrence in 15 (3.4%). Eighty percent of the patients with stomal recurrence had tumors in the subglottis. In comparison to patients with different sites involved this was significant (p less than 0.001). Other variables examined and analyzed included primary stage, previous treatment, neck pathologic status, neck treatment, age, sex, postoperative adjunctive therapy, and timing of tracheotomy. Tumor involvement of the subglottis is the single most important variable in stomal recurrence of carcinoma. Previous conservation laryngeal surgery and preoperative/emergency tracheotomy are not related to stomal recurrence of carcinoma. Mean length of survival for patients with stomal recurrence of carcinoma in our series was 8.9 months. Two patients were successfully treated with extensive surgical resection. The dismal prognosis of stomal recurrence of carcinoma suggests that management of this condition should focus on prevention. Treatment of patients with tumors of the subglottis should include attention to the paratracheal region and superior mediastinum, in conjunction with laryngectomy immediately after initial diagnosis. 
Lung function abnormalities at 6 months of age after neonatal intensive care. Respiratory function was studied in 46 preterm infants (median gestational age 28 weeks) at 6 months of age. Respiratory function was assessed by measurement of thoracic gas volume, airways resistance (from which specific conductance was calculated), and functional residual capacity. To determine the effect of the duration of neonatal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) on respiratory function, the infants' results were divided into three groups: group A, no IPPV; group B, IPPV for less than seven days; and group C, IPPV for more than seven days. Measurements of thoracic gas volume and functional residual capacity were similar to published reference ranges and there were no significant differences between the three groups. Measurements of airways resistance and specific conductance were higher than published reference ranges (mean airways resistance of group A, 34 cm H2O/l/sec; B, 34.1 cm H2O/l/sec, and C, 30.4 cm H2O/l/sec) but there was no significant difference between the three groups. The 95% confidence intervals of the difference of the means between groups A and B were -6.94 to 6.73 cm H2O/l/sec and between groups A and C -3.8 to 11.0 cm H2O/l/sec. Our results suggest that factors other than neonatal ventilation may be more important in the pathogenesis of chronic lung function abnormalities in preterm infants. 
Transesophageal echocardiography: a simple method for monitoring the patency of ventriculoatrial shunts. Technical note. A new method for evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt is described, and early experience with it is reported. Transesophageal echocardiography can demonstrate a cerebrospinal fluid leak in the right atrium through the atrial tip of a shunting device. This capability was an incidental discovery, and since then the accuracy of the technique in evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt has been prospectively studied in 20 observations of 16 patients. The method proved to be accurate in 90% to 100% of cases. It is concluded that transesophageal echocardiography offers a rapid and accurate assessment of ventriculoatrial shunt function, is well tolerated, and is easy to perform. 
Efficacy and safety of intravenous pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone: Lutrepulse for injection. A multicenter trial was undertaken to assess the ability of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone to restore physiologic ovulatory function in women with diminished or absent pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion. In 109 women with primary and secondary hypothalamic amenorrhea, pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (Lutrepulse [gonadorelin acetate] for Injection) was extremely effective, resulting in ovulation in 91% and 96% of patients, respectively. Overall complications of intravenous line placement ranged from 0% to 11% (mean = 7%). A 12% incidence of multiple pregnancy was noted, and a single case of ovarian hyperstimulation was reported in a woman who also received clomiphene citrate. Pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone treatment appears to be of at least comparable efficacy to human menopausal gonadotropins, with the added benefit of reduced overall risks for the patient with hypothalamic amenorrhea. 
Liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 activity in experimental infection: study of the relative effects of infectious stress and malnutrition. OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of infection and malnutrition on liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 (P450) in rats. DESIGN: Controlled experimental groups (12 groups). ANIMALS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTIONS: Experimental endocarditis, pyelonephritis, or peritonitis were caused. Controls included free-fed rats and sham-operated rats, pair-fed to infected animals. Infection was verified by tissue culture. Rats were killed 3 days (acute infection) or 10 days (chronic infection, except endocarditis) after the induction of infection. RESULTS: Sham rats had lower liver weights, liver/body weight, and liver glutathione values than controls. Infected rats had larger liver weights and liver/body weight ratios and liver glutathione content than shams, and larger liver/body weight ratios than controls (acute infection). Infected rats had lower P450 values than both shams and controls. CONCLUSION: The malnutrition associated with infection caused decreased liver weight and glutathione content. Infection increased the liver weight, and liver glutathione content, but caused severe reduction in liver P450. If the same finding is true in infected patients, it could have consequences for the management of such patients. 
Which asymptomatic patients should undergo routine screening carotid duplex scan? The benefits of obtaining a routine screening carotid duplex scan have not been established for patients with peripheral vascular disease but no signs or symptoms of carotid artery disease. We retrospectively reviewed all carotid duplex scans (4,000) performed at our institution between 1985 through 1989 and found for analysis 91 scans in 78 patients who underwent a screening duplex scan because of the presence of peripheral vascular disease. Patients with carotid bruits, abnormal carotid pulses, and focal or nonspecific neurologic symptoms were excluded. Thirty-three percent of these patients had carotid stenosis of 16% to 50%, 14% had carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50%, and 5% had stenosis greater than or equal to 75%. Individual risk factors for atherosclerosis, including elderly age, coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and a recent or past history of cardiac or vascular surgery, did not predict the detection of high-grade carotid stenosis. However, all 11 of the patients with carotid stenosis greater than or equal to 50% were 68 years of age and older, and this age range, in combination with the various risk factors, increased the incidence of significant carotid artery stenosis (greater than or equal to 50%) to as high as 45%. We conclude that routine screening carotid duplex scan is indicated in elderly patients (age greater than or equal to 68 years) with peripheral vascular disease, even in the absence of any signs or symptoms of carotid artery disease, when other atherosclerotic risk factors are present. 
The Carney complex with ocular signs suggestive of cardiac myxoma. We treated a patient who had ophthalmic findings of the Carney complex that led to a search for and the discovery of asymptomatic cardiac myxoma. Substantial morbidity and mortality are associated with the complex because of the occurrence of cardiac myxoma. Facial and eyelid lentigines, conjunctival and caruncle pigmentation and eyelid pigmentation may precede signs or symptoms of cardiac myxoma. A study of the patient's primary relatives disclosed manifestations of the complex transmitted in a manner consistent with mendelian autosomal dominant inheritance. 
Epidemiology of chronic venous ulcers. A metropolitan population of 238,000 in Perth, Western Australia, was screened for chronic ulceration of the leg. Patients with a chronic leg ulcer and a venous abnormality comprised 57 per cent of all patients with a chronic leg ulcer, giving a prevalence of 0.62 per 1000 population. There was an increasing prevalence with age; 90 per cent of patients were 60 years and older. This group comprised 16.7 per cent of the population, and had a prevalence of 3.3 per 1000. Although chronic venous ulcers were more common in women there was no difference in age related prevalence. In 36 per cent of patients with a venous abnormality, there was at least one other aetiological factor contributing to chronic ulceration of the leg; 96 per cent had either a history of deep venous thrombosis or a condition known to predispose to deep venous thrombosis. 
Loss of heterozygosity for alleles on chromosome II in cervical carcinoma. The HeLa cell (a cervical carcinoma cell line) tumor-suppressor gene has been localized to the long arm of chromosome 11 by molecular genetic studies of nontumorigenic and tumorigenic hybrids derived from normal chromosome 11 x HeLa cell fusions. In the present study, 33 primary cervical carcinoma samples were analyzed using chromosome 11-specific polymorphic DNA markers. The RFLP analysis indicated a somatic loss of chromosome 11 heterozygosity in 10 (30%) of the primary tumors. Preferential loss of the long arm of the chromosome was observed in two of the primary tumors. In addition, at least eight-fold amplification of sequences in the q13 region, including those coding for the fibroblast growth factor-related gene (int-2), was observed in one of the primary tumors. These results suggest a possible role for gene(s) localized to chromosome 11, possibly that localized to the long arm in the development and/or progression of cervical carcinomas. 
Flow cytometric deoxyribonucleic acid analysis in stage I renal cell carcinoma. Tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content was analyzed by flow cytometry in 60 consecutive patients with stage I renal cell carcinoma. Of 59 evaluable tumors 27 (46%) were homogeneously diploid, 1 (2%) was tetraploid and 31 (52%) were aneuploid. Of the 32 nondiploid tumors 25 were heterogeneous concerning ploidy. One of the 27 patients with diploid tumors had metastases compared to 5 of the 32 patients with nondiploid tumors (not significant). There was a significant difference in survival between patients with diploid and nondiploid tumors (p = 0.043). Neither nuclear grade, tumor cell type nor tumor size correlated with survival. Analysis of DNA content seems to predict survival significantly for patients with stage I renal cell carcinoma. 
Composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysm of the ascending aorta: results in 100 patients. One hundred consecutive patients with the Marfan syndrome underwent composite graft repair of an ascending aortic aneurysm between September 1976 and June 1989. Twenty-two patients had ascending aortic dissection at the time of composite graft repair; 18 patients also had a mitral valve procedure. There were no hospital deaths among 92 patients undergoing elective repair. One of 8 patients undergoing emergency repair of a ruptured aneurysm died in the operating room. The overall hospital mortality rate was 1%. There have been ten late deaths among the 99 hospital survivors (10.1%). Five deaths occurred among the first 11 patients in this series and five occurred among the last 88 patients (5.7%). Three late deaths resulted from composite graft endocarditis; 3 other patients with endocarditis are alive after aortic root replacement with cryopreserved homografts. Late coronary dehiscence caused death in 1 patient and was successfully repaired in a second. Actuarial survival for the 100 patients was 92.6% at 5 years and 75.8% at 10 years. Currently, composite graft repair of Marfan aneurysms of the ascending aorta can be performed with low hospital and late mortality. Marfan aneurysms with a diameter of 6 cm or greater should be repaired with the Bentall composite graft procedure, even if the patient is asymptomatic. 
Vascularised fibular graft for congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia. Long-term results. Five children with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia treated by free vascularised fibular grafts were followed up until skeletal maturity. The ipsilateral fibula was used in four cases, the contralateral fibula in one. All our cases achieved bone union, but leg length discrepancy, atrophy of the foot and ankle stiffness were frequent complications, due perhaps to the many previous operations. Vascularised fibular grafting might achieve better results if it were done as the primary procedure. 
Optical urethrotomy under local urethral anaesthesia. A series of 46 patients underwent 76 optical urethrotomies under local urethral anaesthesia in the out-patient clinic; in 70% of patients the strictures were controlled by local anaesthetic urethrotomy alone; 61% felt either no pain or mild pain during the procedure; 72% expressed a preference for local anaesthesia should the procedure have to be repeated and 82% were happy with the result of their treatment. Optical urethrotomy under local urethral anaesthesia produces results comparable to those reported by others using general anaesthesia. If large numbers of patients are to be treated, possibly repeatedly, then out-patient urethrotomy may result in more efficient use of resources. 
Current treatment of patients surviving out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Most out-of-hospital cardiac arrests result from the sudden onset of a sustained ventricular arrhythmia in the absence of a new myocardial infarction. Individuals who survive cardiac arrest are at high risk for recurrent arrhythmias and sudden unexpected death. To prevent recurrent cardiac arrest, effective treatment must be provided during hospitalization after the initial episode. Caring for the survivor of cardiac arrest requires a detailed clinical investigation to define the underlying cardiac anatomy and left ventricular function and to elucidate the mechanism and characteristics of the patient's arrhythmia. Appropriate antiarrhythmic therapy, such as drugs or a nonpharmacological intervention (eg, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator), is then selected based on these considerations. In addition, ischemia is treated aggressively with beta-adrenergic blocking agents and, when appropriate, with surgical coronary artery revascularization. 
Differential expression of epidermal growth factor-related proteins in human colorectal tumors. Amphiregulin (AR) and cripto are proteins that are structurally related to epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha). AR is also functionally related to this family of growth regulatory molecules and is able to bind and activate the 170-kDa EGF receptor (EGFR). Human EGFR-3 (HER3)/ERBB3 is a recently identified protein related to the EGFR that is widely expressed in breast carcinomas and is a candidate receptor for EGF-like growth factors. Differential expression of these putative ligands and receptors in transformed cells suggests that they may function in an autocrine manner to regulate tumor cell growth. Specific mRNA transcripts for TGF-alpha [4.8 kilobases (kb)], AR (1.4 kb), cripto (2.2 kb), and HER3 (6.2 kb) were expressed in a majority of human colon cancer cell lines. HER3 mRNA was detected in 55% of primary or metastatic human colorectal carcinomas but in only 22% of normal colon mucosa and 32% of normal liver samples. In contrast, cripto and AR mRNA were expressed in 60-70% of primary or metastatic human colorectal cancers but in only 2-7% of normal human colonic mucosa. Immunostaining also detected AR protein in primary and metastatic colorectal tumors but not in normal colon or uninvolved liver. These findings suggest that cripto and AR may be useful markers to discriminate between normal and malignant colonic epithelium and may provide a selective growth advantage for colorectal carcinomas. 
Helicobacter pylori infection in healthy people: a dynamic process? Epidemiological studies using serological tests have shown that a large proportion of healthy people have antibodies against Helicobacter pylori (anti-Hp). It is uncertain whether the presence of anti-Hp indicates active infection or only past exposure to the micro-organism. In this study we determined anti-Hp with a specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay in 100 healthy volunteers who were at the same time investigated for active H pylori infection by means of the 13C-urea breath test. Forty nine per cent had a high anti-Hp titre, but only 24% had active H pylori infection. Our study suggests that a considerable number of healthy people previously infected with H pylori have spontaneously eliminated this microorganism. We suggest that the inability of ulcer patients to eliminate H pylori may be important in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease. 
The state of the p53 and retinoblastoma genes in human cervical carcinoma cell lines. Human cervical carcinoma cell lines that were either positive or negative for human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA sequences were analyzed for evidence of mutation of the p53 and retinoblastoma genes. Each of five HPV-positive cervical cancer cell lines expressed normal pRB and low levels of wild-type p53 proteins, which are presumed to be altered in function as a consequence of association with HPV E7 and E6 oncoproteins, respectively. In contrast, mutations were identified in the p53 and RB genes expressed in the C-33A and HT-3 cervical cancer cell lines, which lack HPV DNA sequences. Mutations in the p53 genes mapped to codon 273 and codon 245 in the C33-A and HT-3 cell lines, respectively, located in the highly conserved regions of p53, where mutations appear in a variety of human cancers. Mutations in RB occurred at splice junctions, resulting in in-frame deletions, affecting exons 13 and 20 in the HT-3 and C-33A cell lines, respectively. These mutations resulted in aberrant proteins that were not phosphorylated and were unable to complex with the adenovirus E1A oncoprotein. These results support the hypothesis that the inactivation of the normal functions of the tumor-suppressor proteins pRB and p53 are important steps in human cervical carcinogenesis, either by mutation or from complex formation with the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins. 
Renal cell carcinoma in children. Six cases of renal cell carcinoma in children between seven and nineteen years of age are reported. These patients differ from those with Wilms tumor chiefly in the age of presentation and response to chemotherapy. Radiographically, renal cell carcinoma cannot be distinguished from Wilms tumor. While the natural history of renal cell carcinoma appears to be similar in children and adults, it may have a more favorable prognosis below the age of ten years. 
Delayed excitatory reaction following interaction of cocaine and monoamine oxidase inhibitor (phenelzine). A case report is presented in which a patient receiving the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, phenelzine, developed a delayed excitatory reaction following administration of topical cocaine spray during anaesthesia for vocal cord surgery. The pharmacological basis of the drug interaction is discussed. 
Comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct, depressive, anxiety, and other disorders. OBJECTIVE: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a heterogeneous disorder of unknown etiology. Little is known about the comorbidity of this disorder with disorders other than conduct. Therefore, the authors made a systematic search of the psychiatric and psychological literature for empirical studies dealing with the comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with other disorders. DATA COLLECTION: The search terms included hyperactivity, hyperkinesis, attention deficit disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cross-referenced with antisocial disorder (aggression, conduct disorder, antisocial disorder), depression (depression, mania, depressive disorder, bipolar), anxiety (anxiety disorder, anxiety), learning problems (learning, learning disability, academic achievement), substance abuse (alcoholism, drug abuse), mental retardation, and Tourette's disorder. FINDINGS: The literature supports considerable comorbidity of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, learning disabilities, and other disorders, such as mental retardation, Tourette's syndrome, and borderline personality disorder. CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder might be delineated on the basis of the disorder's comorbidity with other disorders. These subgroups may have differing risk factors, clinical courses, and pharmacological responses. Thus, their proper identification may lead to refinements in preventive and treatment strategies. Investigation of these issues should help to clarify the etiology, course, and outcome of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 
Alterations in myocyte shape and basement membrane attachment with tachycardia-induced heart failure. Chronic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) results in left ventricular (LV) dilatation and dysfunction. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for LV failure in this setting are not known. LV force production is dependent on the coupling of myocytes to the extracellular matrix, which is mediated through the basement membrane. This study was designed to determine whether alterations in myocyte geometry and basement membrane attachment are associated with LV failure in a pacing-induced model of cardiomyopathy. Echocardiographic measurement of LV function was performed in six pigs after 3 weeks of pacing-induced SVT (240 beats/min) and in eight sham-operated controls. Myocytes from these hearts were isolated, and attachment studies to specific components of the basement membrane were performed using laminin, fibronectin, and collagen IV. The SVT group when compared with the control group showed a significant reduction of LV fractional shortening (14 +/- 2% versus 31 +/- 2%, respectively; p less than 0.05), increased end-diastolic dimension (50 +/- 1 versus 35 +/- 1 mm, respectively; p less than 0.05), and lengthening of isolated myocytes (196 +/- 18 versus 142 +/- 9 microns, respectively; p less than 0.05). Myocyte attachment to laminin (50 micrograms/ml) was significantly decreased at 60 minutes in the SVT group compared with the control group (18.2 +/- 4.5 versus 60.9 +/- 4.5 cells/mm2, respectively; p less than 0.05). Similar reductions in myocyte attachment to fibronectin and collagen IV were observed. Ultrastructural examination of LV sections revealed focal disruptions of the basement membrane-sarcolemmal interface and a reduced number of sarcolemmal festoons in SVT hearts compared with control hearts (0.8 +/- 0.6 versus 2.8 +/- 0.8/4 microns, respectively; p less than 0.05). These alterations in myocyte morphology and basement membrane attachment may contribute to the LV failure associated with chronic SVT. Further, these structural changes may play a significant role in the progression of ventricular dysfunction as well as recovery from chronic SVT. 
Selective cytotoxicity of low-density lipoprotein to helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after photoperoxidation with 8-methoxypsoralen. Lymphocyte-containing plasma subjected to photolysis in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen (methoxsalen, 8-MOP) has previously been shown to be effective against cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and the AIDS-related complex. The mechanism of this effect was thought to involve photoreaction of 8-MOP with DNA, based on certain in vitro experiments. The results of this study suggest a different mechanism. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from fresh human plasma was photosensitized by addition of 8-MOP and exposure to UV light (mp-LDL), and the reactions of the LDL lipids and the chemical actions induced by these reactions were monitored. In a separate procedure, LDL was peroxidized with hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase (p-LDL). mp-LDL and p-LDL were then tested in cytotoxicity assays on HuT-78 helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. These results indicate that (a) LDL in plasma in the presence of very low concentrations of 8-MOP (200 ng/mL) can be peroxidized by UV light; (b) this photoperoxidized LDL is cytotoxic to helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in a dose-dependent manner; but (c) it does not kill normal lymphocytes under similar conditions. The findings also suggest alternative therapeutic strategies for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as direct utilization of peroxidized LDL. 
Monosialoganglioside in subarachnoid hemorrhage [published erratum appears in Stroke 1991 Jul;22(7):957] We studied 119 patients with disturbance of consciousness following subarachnoid hemorrhage, due mostly to verified aneurysm rupture, admitted to five Italian neurosurgical departments over 18 months. Level of consciousness as assessed by score on the Glasgow coma Scale ranged from 8 to 14 before the beginning of treatment; level of consciousness was assessed again 7, 14, and 21 days later. Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with monosialoganglioside or placebo according to a double-blind experimental design. The two treatment groups were homogeneous at entry with regard to the main clinical parameters. Both groups improved, but the rate and degree of improvement were greater in the monosialoganglioside-treated group. The difference was significant on days 14 (p = 0.04) and 21 (p = 0.02). Our results seem to confirm the hypothesis that monosialoganglioside reduces brain edema and provides nonspecific neuronal membrane protection. 
Antenatal therapy to minimize neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage. Periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage is an important problem, resulting in significant mortality and morbidity. Attempts to reduce this complication require an understanding of its pathogenesis. In this chapter a model was proposed, consisting of a series of events resulting in rapid changes of cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure and leading to rupture of the unique fragile vessels of the germinal matrix and intraventricular regions. Understanding the beneficial physiologic changes induced by such agents such as phenobarbital and vitamin K and that such pharmacologic therapy must be started during the antenatal period has resulted in significant reductions of severe grades of IVH. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these results using these two drugs alone and in combination. Other potentially beneficial drugs such as indomethacin should be investigated. Although the benefits of such therapy may improve perinatal outcome, the emphasis in our discipline should be the continued attempt to prevent the delivery of these VLBW infants. 
Clinical and CT correlates in the diagnosis of intracranial tumours. The correlation between clinical and CT findings in cerebral tumours was prospectively studied in 1191 consecutive referrals for cerebral CT. CT revealed a mass lesion in 51 cases (4.3%): 32 neoplasms, five haematomas and one abscess. The diagnostic specificity of CT for neoplasmic tumours was 86% (32 of 37). The clinical suspicion of a cerebral neoplasm was correct in 25 cases (78%) and the clinical localisatory hypothesis was correct in 20 cases (63%) of the neoplasms. A cerebral tumour was found in 5% (11 out of 226) of patients investigated for their first seizure and in 1% (two of 207) investigated for headache without clinical signs. 
Anorectal physiology testing. A survey of availability and use. Survey forms were sent to all members of the Coloproctology Section of the Royal Society of Medicine and the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons to obtain their opinions of the availability, actual use, and perceived helpfulness of different methods for the evaluation of the physiology of the colon and rectum. Responses revealed a similarity in age and practice patterns in both groups. Of the 19 methods surveyed, greater than 90 percent of respondents in both groups rely on three traditional methods of patient evaluation: patient history, digital examination, and sigmoidoscopy. Four other methods have gained acceptance by the majority of respondents in both groups: colon transit studies, defecography, perfused-catheter manometry, and rectal compliance. The three methods ranked lowest in availability, actual use, and helpfulness by both groups were single-fiber electromyography, use of a perineometer, and evoked potential studies. Our study provides a baseline for future surveys on the investigative efforts of physicians studying the physiology of the colon, rectum, and anus. 
Familial multicentric paragangliomas in a child. A 12-year-old girl presented with bilateral carotid-body paragangliomas and a unilateral jugular paraganglioma. The tumours were surgically removed. This is a rare combination of tumours in any patient and previously unreported in a child of this age. Her father died of a cerebellar astrocytoma and her mother underwent surgical removal of a large mediastinal paraganglioma. The association of astrocytoma with familial paragangliomas has never been documented. The literature on the epidemiology and inheritance pattern of familial paragangliomas is reviewed. The need for thorough pre-operative evaluation of the patient and close follow-up of family members is stressed. 
Role of hepatitis delta virus infection in hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA integrates into the host DNA and shows a series of potentially oncogenetic properties, but HBV is not an acutely transforming virus, because HCC develops decades after infection. Other factors, namely cirrhosis, inflammation, alcohol intake, and viral superinfections, could promote the oncogenetic process induced by HBV-DNA integration. We studied the impact of HDV infection in the pathogenesis of HCC in 62 consecutive patients. Their mean age was 59 years (range 25-75 years), 54 were male and eight female; 58 had cirrhosis. The findings suggest that HBsAg-positive patients with HDV superinfection developed cirrhosis and HCC at an earlier age than HBsAg carriers without HDV infection. HDV appears to represent a "promotion" factor for HCC in subjects with an oncogenic risk induced by HBV. A long-lasting necroinflammatory lesion of the liver substained by productive HBV and HDV infections may be a major pathogenetic mechanism. 
A pilot study of the efficacy and safety of bolus administration of alteplase in acute myocardial infarction. OBJECTIVE--To examine the efficacy, safety, and the pharmacokinetic profile of a bolus dose administration regimen of alteplase in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN--An open pilot study. SETTING--District general hospital. PATIENTS--33 suitable consecutive patients presenting within six hours of the onset of symptoms who satisfied the electrocardiographic criteria for acute myocardial infarction. INTERVENTIONS--Two intravenous boluses of 35 mg alteplase, 30 minutes apart. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Angiographic coronary patency at 90 minutes and 24 hours. Plasma alteplase concentration-time profile and pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS--Coronary patency at 90 minutes: 26 of 30 arteries (87%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 74-99%). Coronary patency at 24 hours: 24 of 29 arteries (83%, CI 69-97%). Mean (SD) plasma tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentration reached 4434.8 (2117.8) and 4233.3 (2217.5) ng/ml within 10 minutes of each bolus and fell to 425.8 (288.3) ng/ml between boluses. The estimated peak concentrations at two minutes after boluses were 12,389 (8580) ng/ml and 10,811 (6802) ng/ml. The derived pharmacokinetic variables were volume of distribution 3.11 (1.89) 1, clearance 21.3 (9.3) 1/h, half life 5.9 (1.7) minutes. CONCLUSIONS--This simple administration regimen achieved brief, high concentrations of plasma t-PA that were well tolerated. The regimen was associated with a high coronary patency rate at 90 minutes that was well maintained at 24 hours. 
Altered myocardial high-energy phosphate metabolites in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Myocardial high-energy phosphate metabolism in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) of ischemic or idiopathic etiology was assessed at rest by one-dimensional phase-encoded 31P-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy studies performed in conjunction with 1H imaging in 20 patients with DCM and in 12 normal volunteers. The measured values of anterior myocardial phosphocreatine/beta-adenosine triphosphate (PCr/beta-ATP), corrected for partial saturation and contamination of the spectra by blood metabolites, averaged 1.80 +/- 0.06 (mean +/- SE) in normal volunteers and 1.46 +/- 0.07 in the patients overall, a highly significant (p less than 0.001) decrease. In patients with DCM accompanied by coronary artery disease (n = 9), the PCr/beta-ATP ratio averaged 1.53 +/- 0.07, while in those with DCM alone it was 1.41 +/- 0.12 (n = 11), a value that was not significantly different. There was no significant correlation (r = 0.34) between myocardial PCr/ATP ratio and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients. These studies demonstrate that myocardial PCr/ATP ratios are reduced at rest in human ischemic and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. 
Angelchik prosthesis complicates treatment of adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus. Indications for use of the Angelchik prosthesis remain controversial, and many surgeons actively involved in the treatment of reflux disease have not used the device. We describe a case that illustrates difficulties associated with resection of a tumor in the presence of this prothesis. Such experience suggests that patients known to have Barrett's esophagus might be better treated with standard antireflux procedures. 
Effect of graded reductions of coronary pressure and flow on myocardial metabolism and performance: a model of "hibernating" myocardium. The term "hibernating" myocardium has been applied to chronic left ventricular dysfunction without angina or ischemic electrocardiographic changes in patients with coronary artery disease that is reversed by therapy that increases myocardial blood flow. To investigate the relation between coronary blood flow and ventricular function experimentally, graded reductions in coronary artery pressure were produced in isolated perfused rat hearts as contractile performance (peak systolic pressure and its first derivative [dP/dt]) and metabolic variables were measured using phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. As coronary pressure and flow were reduced, significant reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption and contractile performance were observed, which returned to control levels when coronary artery pressure and flow were restored to baseline values. Two phases of metabolic abnormality were observed. With modest reductions in coronary perfusion, proportionate reductions in myocardial oxygen consumption and contractile behavior were accompanied by a slight reduction in creatine phosphate but no significant lactate production. With greater reductions in coronary artery pressure and flow, creatine phosphate decreased more, adenosine triphosphate levels and myocardial pH decreased significantly and myocardial lactate production increased. The balanced reductions in myocardial contractility and oxygen consumption without metabolic abnormalities traditionally associated with "ischemia" observed in the first phase provides evidence in normal hearts for resetting of the myocardial contractile behavior and oxygen consumption in the presence of reduced coronary flow (that is, hibernating myocardium). The data suggest that reductions in adenosine diphosphate and the index of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (lactate formation) do not explain the coupling between coronary artery pressure and flow and myocardial oxygen consumption as contractile performance decreases. 
Pulmonary and urinary clearance of atrial natriuretic factor in acute congestive heart failure in dogs. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) is a peptide hormone of cardiac origin elevated in acute congestive heart failure (CHF), which is degraded by the enzyme neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP). This study was designed to investigate the pulmonary and urinary clearance of ANF before and after the initiation of acute experimental CHF in dogs, and to assess the contribution of enzymatic degradation to these clearances in CHF. This study demonstrated a significant clearance of plasma ANF across the pulmonary circulation at baseline, and a tendency for pulmonary clearance to decrease in CHF (1115 +/- 268 to 498 +/- 173 ml/min, NS). The pulmonary extraction of ANF present at baseline was not altered with acute CHF (36.0 +/- 7.8 to 34.9 +/- 12.1%, NS). NEP inhibition (NEPI) abolished both the clearance and extraction of plasma ANF across the lung in CHF. Similarly, significant urinary clearance of ANF was present at baseline, and in acute CHF the urinary clearance of ANF decreased (0.14 +/- 0.02 to 0.02 +/- 0.01 ml/min, P less than 0.05). NEPI prevented the decrease in the urinary clearance of ANF, and enhanced the renal response to endogenous ANF, independent of further increases in plasma ANF during CHF. This study supports an important role for NEP in the pulmonary and urinary metabolism of endogenous ANF during acute CHF. 
Non-trauma mortality in elderly women with low bone mineral density. Study of Osteoporotic Fractures Research Group. 9704 ambulatory women aged 65 years or older were prospectively studied to determine whether low bone mineral density (osteopenia) was associated with mortality. Bone mineral density was measured at entry to the study by single-photon absorptiometry. 299 women died during a mean of 2.8 years' follow-up. Osteopenia was associated with increased non-trauma mortality, probably because it is a marker for several other adverse factors. Each standard deviation decrease in proximal radius bone mineral density (0.104 g/cm2) was associated with a 1.19-fold increase in mortality (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.36), adjusted for age and duration of follow-up. Diminished bone mineral density at the proximal radius was strongly associated with deaths from stroke (relative risk = 1.74; 95% CI 1.12-2.70), an association that was not confounded by history of previous stroke, hypertension, postmenopausal use of oestrogen, thiazide diuretic treatment, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Most deaths in women with low bone mineral density are unrelated to the occurrence of fractures-an observation that should be taken into account when estimating the need for and cost-effectiveness of bone-density screening and fracture prevention programmes. 
Reversible inactivation of the insular cortex by tetrodotoxin produces retrograde and anterograde amnesia for inhibitory avoidance and spatial learning. Tetrodotoxin (TTX; a voltage-sensitive sodium channel blocker) was microinjected bilaterally into the insular (IC), frontal (FC), or parietal (PC) cortex or the ventral caudate nucleus of rats either before or after they were trained in an inhibitory avoidance task. When administered either before or after training, injections of TTX into the IC impaired performance on a 48-hr retention test. Injections of TTX into the PC also impaired retention when administered before training. One week later, rats with cannulae in the IC, FC, and PC received microinjections of TTX either before or after training in a water maze (Morris) spatial learning task and retention was tested 24 hr later. TTX impaired retention when administered to the IC either before or after training. These findings indicate that a functionally intact IC during and after training in these tasks appears to be essential for the storage of long-term memory. 
The effect of elemental diet on intestinal permeability and inflammation in Crohn's disease. This study examines whether treatment of acute Crohn's disease with an elemental diet improves intestinal integrity and inflammation as assessed by a 51Cr-labeled ethylenediaminetetraacetatic acid (EDTA) permeability test and the fecal excretion of 111In-labeled autologous leukocytes, respectively. Thirty-four patients with active Crohn's disease completed a 4-week treatment course with an elemental diet. Active disease was characterized by increased intestinal permeability [24-hour urine excretion of orally administered 51Cr-EDTA, 6.4% +/- 0.6% (mean +/- SE); normal, less than 3.0%] and by high fecal excretion of 111In-labeled leukocytes (14.2% +/- 1.1%; normal, less than 1.0%). Twenty-seven (80%) went into clinical remission, usually within a week of starting treatment. After 4 weeks of treatment, there was a significant decrease in both the urine excretion of 51Cr-EDTA (to 3.4% +/- 0.5%; P less than 0.01) and the fecal excretion of 111In (to 5.7% +/- 1.0%; P less than 0.001), indicating that such treatment is not just symptomatic. A framework for the mechanism by which elemental diet works, centering around the importance of the integrity of the intestinal barrier function, is proposed, and also appears to provide a logical explanation for some relapses of the disease. 
The effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on renal growth, function and arterial blood pressure in an animal model. The long-term effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) on children treated for renal calculi are unclear. To study the long-term bio-effects of this mode of treatment on the immature animal we evaluated 30 New Zealand white rabbits at 7 weeks of age for weight, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and arterial blood pressure after which they underwent left nephrectomy. Each group of 5 rabbits received ESWL of varying levels (500 to 3,000 shock waves) to the remaining right kidney using the Northgate SD3 lithotriptor (spark gap mediated). One control group received no shock waves. At maturity (16 weeks) the aforementioned parameters were measured again, and the kidneys and any grossly abnormal adjacent organs were examined. We found no significant change in total animal growth, renal growth, renal function or perirenal organs in the post-ESWL groups versus the control group. All post-ESWL groups had an increase in mean arterial blood pressure versus the control group with 3 of 6 groups showing significant increases (p less than 0.05). Histological renal changes, seen at all energy levels of ESWL delivered, included interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, glomeruli destruction, capsular thickening, perivascular fibrosis and mild arteriole wall thickening. Changes were proportional to the number of shocks received. We conclude that ESWL delivered to immature animals does not significantly affect renal growth and function but it can cause significant permanent histological renal changes even at low doses and may result in an increase in adult mean arterial blood pressure. 
Secretory diarrhea following a dog bite. Overwhelming sepsis is rarely complicated by secretory diarrhea. We present a case of fulminant sepsis associated with dermatologic manifestations, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and a severe secretory diarrhea that has not previously been described. This followed a dog bite, and the patient was otherwise healthy. The combination of septic shock, skin lesions, and DIC occurring after a dog bite has been attributed to dysgonic fermentor 2 organisms, now called Capnocytophaga canimorsus, but none were cultured in this case (7). Dysgonic fermentor-2 may be a new cause of secretory diarrhea and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of overwhelming sepsis associated with diarrhea. 
Long-term efficacy of oral cisapride in symptomatic upper gut dysmotility. We conducted a 12-month trial of cisapride (10 mg three times a day) in 21 patients with gastric stasis due to clinically and manometrically diagnosed gastroparesis (N = 9; seven due to diabetes) or chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (N = 12). Radionuclide solid-liquid gastric emptying tests were performed at baseline and at the end of the 12-month period. Symptoms were assessed monthly by diary and every three months by the investigators; frequency and severity of symptoms were scored in a standardized manner. For the whole group of 21 patients, gastric emptying of both solids and liquids improved significantly after one year of cisapride (P less than 0.05). Among chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients, there was predominantly an improvement in gastric emptying of solids; in contrast, patients with gastroparesis had a greater improvement in liquid emptying. Total symptom score improved significantly in the gastroparesis group (median score: 8 at baseline vs 6 at one year, P less than 0.05) but not in the chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction patients (median score at baseline 10 vs 9 at one year). Similarly, body weight showed a trend towards improvement in the gastroparesis group. No significant side effects were noted. We conclude that during a 12-month open trial, cisapride was effective in improving gastric emptying in patients with gastric stasis and consistently improved symptoms in those with gastroparesis. 
Growth patterns and prognosis of submucosal carcinoma of the esophagus. A pathologic study. Sixteen cases of esophageal carcinoma invading the submucosa were analyzed in terms of growth patterns. Seven were classified into the massively penetrating (down growth) type, four into the superficially spreading (spreading growth) type, and five into the unclassified type. In the down growth type, the ratio of the submucosal area to the total (mucosa and submucosa) area was more than 0.2 (one fifth), and in the others that ratio was less than 0.2. The down growth type is characterized by a tendency toward elevated lesions, a high incidence of vessel invasions and lymph node metastasis, and a poor prognosis after surgery. Lymphatic and/or vascular invasions were recognized in six of seven cases, and the 5-year survival rate was 0%. In contrast, the spreading growth and unclassified types was characterized by superficial lesions, a low incidence of vessel invasions and lymph node metastasis, and a favorable prognosis. In only one with the spreading growth type was there lymphatic invasion. Three of the four with the spreading growth type survived over 5 years, and the other one with the spreading growth type and all of five with the unclassified type are alive without recurrences 15 to 52 months after surgery. Thus, growth patterns reflect well the prognosis of the submucosal carcinoma of the esophagus. 
Cerebral balloon angioplasty for treatment of vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty can offer marked improvement to selected patients with ischemic deficits caused by cerebral vasospasm. Vasospasm resulting from subarachnoid hemorrhage related to aneurysmal rupture or occurring during detachable balloon embolization therapy for treatment of an aneurysm has responded to angioplasty when conventional methods have failed. Indications, appropriate timing, patient selection, and nursing implications for cerebral angioplasty are discussed in this article. 
Home blood pressure monitoring for mild hypertensives. A clinical trial of 204 untreated patients with mild hypertension was conducted to assess the effect of home blood pressure monitoring on blood pressure level, pharmacologic treatment, reduction of risk factors, and use of health services. After 1 year, no statistically significant differences were found between the treatment and control groups. The findings indicate that, while home blood pressure monitoring may be useful, it has no measurable short-term impact on these aspects of blood pressure management for patients with mild hypertension. 
Cecal rupture after continent ileocecal urinary diversion during total pelvic exenteration. Continent ureteral diversion at the time of pelvic exenteration avoids an external appliance and allows patients to retain "bladder" reservoir function. The technical difficulty of this procedure requires meticulous attention to operative and perioperative care, particularly after pelvic irradiation. A patient with recurrent stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix underwent total pelvic exenteration with reconstructive procedures including low rectal anastomosis, neovagina formation, and ileocecal (Indiana) continent diversion. Early catheterization of the reservoir began 2 weeks postoperatively. One week later cecal rupture occurred, not related to suture line (technical) failure. Because of the high wall tension and reduced compliance in the irradiated cecum, we do not recommend catheterization of the urinary reservoir before 4-6 weeks. In order for continent diversion to become the standard diversion in exenteration patients, the major complication rate must remain comparable to that of noncontinent diversion. 
Isoflurane partially preserves energy balance in isolated hepatocytes during in vitro anoxia. We investigated whether a volatile anesthetic (1.5% isoflurane or 1.0% halothane) or an added anaerobic energy source (10 mM glucose or fructose) could act directly on liver cells to protect energy status during 20-30 min of anoxia. We used hepatocytes freshly isolated from fed rats or rats that had fasted, suspended them in Krebs' buffer, and incubated them in sealed flasks under O2/CO2 or N2/CO2 (95%:5%). The adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ratio (ATP/ADP) measured cellular energy balance--the balance between overall ATP supply and demand. Lactate levels measured the extent to which ATP was supplied by the nonmitochondrial pathway, (anaerobic) glycolysis. Maximum values of energy balance were seen in cells from fed rats incubated in the presence of glucose and O2. When glucose was replaced by fructose, ATP/ADP decreased and lactate increased. During anoxia (O2 replaced by N2), increases in lactate were also seen with glucose; and ATP/ADP decreased to similarly low values with both substrates. In cells from fasted rats, ATP/ADP decreased significantly below the value for cells from fed rats only in the presence of glucose and O2. Compared with cells from fed rats, cells from fasted rats showed decreased lactate in the face of decreased ATP/ADP, suggesting that glycolysis was impaired. Isoflurane partially prevented anoxia-induced decreases in ATP/ADP. This protective effect on energy balance occurred equally with glucose and fructose, but was not seen in cells from fasted rats or with halothane. Thus, 1 MAC isoflurane and some factor(s) related to the fed state combined to protect partially the energy balance in anoxic liver cells through action(s) at the cellular level. 
CAncer Rehabilitation Evaluation System--short form (CARES-SF). A cancer specific rehabilitation and quality of life instrument. The CAncer Rehabilitation Evaluation System (CARES) (CARES Consultants, Santa Monica, CA) a rehabilitation and quality of life instrument with well-documented reliability and validity, has been shortened. This report describes the development and psychometric properties of the new instrument, the CAncer Rehabilitation Evaluation System--Short Form (CARES-SF). The data from four existing samples of cancer patients demonstrate that the CARES-SF is highly related to the CARES (r = 0.98), has excellent test-retest reliability (86% agreement), concurrent validity with related measures, and acceptable internal consistency of summary scales (alpha = 0.85 to 0.61). In a new sample of breast cancer patients evaluated at three points in time (1 month, 7 months, and 13 months after diagnosis) the instrument appears to be sensitive to change and is highly related to the Functional Living Index--Cancer (FLIC), an existing quality of life instrument. The authors conclude that the CARES-SF has excellent potential as a quality of life instrument for use in clinical trials. 
A prospective evaluation of hepatic resection for colorectal carcinoma metastases to the liver: Gastrointestinal Tumor Study Group Protocol 6584. We report here the results of the first multiinstitutional prospective evaluation of patients considered to have potentially resectable hepatic metastases from colorectal carcinoma. One hundred fifty-six patients were enrolled from 15 institutions. Six patients were subsequently excluded. One hundred fifty patients underwent surgery and are evaluable for analysis (median follow-up time, 3.1 years; range, 4 months to 5.1 years). Curative resection could be performed on 46% of patients (69 of 150), noncurative resection on 12% (18 of 150), while 42% were found to be unresectable (63 of 150). Thirty-day surgical mortality and morbidity rates in patients with attempted resection were 2.7% and 13%, respectively. The curative resection group was observed to have an improved median survival (37.1 months) compared with the noncurative resection group (21.2 months) and the unresectable group (16.5 months) (P less than .01). Computed tomographic (CT) scan was a poor predictor for resectability, and age was not a contraindication to curative resection. Preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) values were also a poor predictor for resectability. However, the median CEA value 61 to 180 days postsurgery was significantly higher in unresectable patients compared with median CEA levels in noncuratively and curatively resected groups (P less than .01). Our results imply that curative resection leads to an increase in median survival. Noncurative resection provides no benefit to asymptomatic patients, since unresectable and noncurative resection groups have similar life expectancies. Longer follow-up will be needed to demonstrate the ultimate impact of curative resection on survival. 
Cytofluorometric analysis of metastases from lung adenocarcinoma with special reference to the difference between hematogenous and lymphatic metastases. Metastatic tumors in the brain, liver, and regional lymph nodes (20 cases each) from patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung were examined by cytofluorometric analysis, and compared with the respective primary lung tumors. The nuclear DNA content of tumor cells was significantly increased in metastatic tumors in the brain and liver compared with the primary (P less than 0.01). However, the DNA content of metastatic tumors in regional lymph nodes was almost identical to that of the primary tumor in many instances. From the viewpoint of the nuclear DNA content of lung adenocarcinoma, blood-borne tumor cells in the brain and liver were considered likely to constitute a discrete tumor cell subpopulation, i.e., probably a more malignant one, different from the major subpopulation in the primary tumor, whereas lymphatic metastases in regional lymph nodes were similar to the primary. The subpopulation with an increased DNA content in hematogenous metastases were thought to have originated from a minor subpopulation in the primary tumor or to have developed at the metastatic site. 
Ovulation induction with gonadotropins in women with polycystic ovary disease. Seventy-two infertile women with polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) and clomiphene citrate treatment failure underwent 220 human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment cycles for ovulation induction over a period of 19 months. Forty-two patients ovulated but failed to conceive on clomiphene, and the remaining 30 failed to ovulate on clomiphene. Monitoring of treatment consisted of serum 17 beta-estradiol (E2) levels and ultrasonic assessment of follicular growth. Treatment was withheld whenever the E2 levels exceeded 1,500 pg/mL and/or when more than two follicles greater than or equal to 17 mm in diameter each were encountered on ultrasonography. Twenty-nine patients conceived (40.2%), and 23 delivered viable infants. Twenty-three of the 29 pregnancies were achieved in the 42 patients who ovulated on clomiphene, while only 6 pregnancies resulted in the 32 anovulatory patients on clomiphene. Six patients (20.6%) aborted in the first trimester. Multiple pregnancies consisted of only two sets of twins (6.9%). There were only two cases of mild hyperstimulation (2.7%) and no severe hyperstimulation. Because of the low occurrence of multiple pregnancies and hyperstimulation and the reasonable success rate, all PCOD patients should be started on this protocol. 
A randomized study of cisplatin versus cisplatin plus vindesine for non-small cell lung carcinoma. Between August 1983 and March 1985, a randomized study was conducted that compared cisplatin (CDDP) (80 mg/m2 on day 1) alone with CDDP plus vindesine (VDS) (3 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15) in 160 consecutive patients with inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). There were no complete responses. The response rate for CDDP plus VDS (22 of 77 patients, 29%) was significantly higher than that for CDDP alone (9 of 78 patients, 12%) (P less than 0.05). However, no difference existed in the median duration of response (20 weeks for CDDP plus VDS versus 20 weeks for CDDP alone) or the median survival time (45 weeks for CDDP plus VDS versus 39 weeks for CDDP alone). No significant differences in toxicity were detected between the two arms; myelosuppression, alopecia, and peripheral neuropathy occurred more frequently with CDDP plus VDS and there was one lethal episode of hepatorenal syndrome in the CDDP plus VDS arm. Among the variables Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS), age, sex, stage, weight loss, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, albumin level, histologic cell type, and chemotherapy arm, only chemotherapy arm was a significant factor leading to a major response (P = 0.019, multiple logistic regression analysis). The significant predictors of survival were PS (P = 0.000), sex (P = 0.000), and stage (P = 0.002) (Cox's proportional hazards model), with a PS of 0 or 1, female sex, and lower stage yielding the best survival. Although a significantly higher response rate was obtained in the combination arm than in the single agent arm, the survival benefit to patients receiving such combination chemotherapy was not determined and more effective chemotherapy regimens are required. 
Hyperreactivity of tubuloglomerular feedback in chronically salt-loaded spontaneous hypertensive rats. In order to investigate the mechanisms of the hyperreactivity of the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) mechanism in spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) the resetting of TGF by chronic dietary NaCl loading was studied in SHR and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKY). This treatment is known to reset the TGF by an inhibitory factor in tubular fluid and not by alterations of the intrinsic characteristics of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA). TGF reactivity, and its resetting, were determined by loop of Henle perfusion with artificial late proximal tubular fluid and with harvested endogenous tubular fluid respectively. Dietary effects of the high sodium intake were measured by means of the systolic blood pressure (SBP), plasma volume (PV), and renal sodium excretion. The 4-week dietary treatment had no significant influence on SBP in WKY, whereas it accelerated the rise of SBP in SHR significantly. After 1 week of treatment, PV was increased in both WKY and SHR as compared with the control groups kept on the normal diet. Whereas PV in WKY declined to control values over the next 3 weeks, SHR remained expanded. GFR was similar in all groups, whereas urinary sodium excretion was significantly increased in salt-loaded SHR and WKY. Dietary salt loading was paralleled by the appearance of a TGF-inhibiting substance in the tubular fluid in SHR and WKY. However, when assayed with artificial late proximal tubular fluid, hyperreactivity was similar in normal and salt-loaded SHR as compared with WKY. Thus, in SHR TGF hyperreactivity is maintained in spite of volume expansion and TGF resetting by a humoral factor in tubular fluid. 
Supraventricular tachycardia. Changes in management. The various forms of supraventricular tachycardia can be differentiated by careful review of a patient's electrocardiogram. If reentrant tachycardia involves the atrioventricular node, intravenous adenosine (Adenocard) provides a rapid means of converting the tachycardia to sinus rhythm. Adverse effects of adenosine, though common, are mild and of brief duration. Wide QRS complex tachycardia of ventricular origin is usually not affected by the drug. 
Three-port perineal sparing technique. The records were reviewed of 103 patients with low-lying pelvic malignancies irradiated with a skin-sparing technique involving use of a pair of anteroposterior-posteroanterior opposed ports and a direct perineal port. Patients had rectal, anal, cervical, vaginal, urethral, or vulvar cancer. Use of a special lead compensator allowed the three beams to be applied perpendicularly to the surface, while delivery of a homogeneous dose to the pelvis and perineum was maintained. Skin dose with this method was greatly reduced compared with that delivered with simple opposing or four-port techniques, in which irradiation is tangential to the surface at the perineum. Acute perineal skin irritation was assigned a grade between 0 and 3, with grade 0 representing the least amount of irritation. All patients were in the grade 0 or grade 1 category. Patients treated for low-lying rectal carcinoma showed no increase in perineal recurrences when compared with historic control subjects. Use of this approach allowed delivery of adequate doses to the pelvis and perineum and a definite decrease in local toxic effects, and local control was not compromised. 
Pancreatic lesions in the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome. Common manifestations of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, an autosomally dominant inherited cancer-prone disorder, include retinal angiomatosis, hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system, renal cysts, renal cancer, pheochromocytoma, and epididymal cystadenoma. Multiple cysts and microcystic (serous) cystadenomas of the pancreas have also been reported occasionally in patients afflicted with this syndrome. In the large Freiburg study of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome composed of 66 affected individuals, pancreatic lesions were systematically studied. Fifty-five living individuals were examined by abdominal ultrasound imaging. Abnormal findings were confirmed by computed tomographic scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging. For an additional 11 decreased patients autopsy data were available. Cystic lesions of the pancreas were found in 10 patients (15%). One of these patients presented with multiple pancreatic cysts as the only manifestation of the syndrome. In one patient, a malignant islet-cell tumor was found at autopsy. Because multiple pancreatic cysts did not cause major clinical symptoms and because follow-up examinations over an average period of 5 years did not show significant progression of the lesions, it is concluded that these patients usually do not require surgical treatment. Abdominal ultrasound screening is recommended for patients at risk as a tool to identify potential von Hippel-Lindau syndrome gene carriers with pancreatic manifestations. In all patients with multiple pancreatic cysts, the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis. 
Cost-effectiveness of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. To determine the cost-effectiveness of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (such as lovastatin) for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, we used the Coronary Heart Disease Policy Model, a computer-stimulated model that estimates the risk factor-specific annual incidence of coronary heart disease and the risk of recurrent coronary events in persons with prevalent coronary heart disease. When used for secondary prevention, 20 mg/d of lovastatin was estimated to save lives and save costs in younger men with cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L) and to have a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio regardless of the cholesterol level except in young women with cholesterol levels below 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L). Doses of 40 mg/d of lovastatin had favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios in men with cholesterol levels above 250 mg/dL (6.47 mmol/L). By comparison, primary prevention had favorable cost-effectiveness ratios only in selected subgroups based on cholesterol levels and other established risk factors. We conclude that current national recommendations regarding medication for secondary prevention are not as aggressive as our projections would suggest, while recommendations regarding the use of medications for primary prevention should consider the cost of medication as well as the risk factor profile of the individual patient. 
Investigation of colonic prostaglandins in carcinogenesis in the rat colon. Large bowel carcinoma was induced in rats by injecting MNNG intrarectally, and changes in the large bowel mucosa prostaglandin (PG) with time were determined. The PGE2 levels of the colonic mucosa in a control group were 20.9 +/- 9.7 (pg/mg total protein) at 5 weeks, 25.5 +/- 9.7 at 10 weeks, 26.5 +/- 18.1 at 20 weeks, and 34.8 +/- 12.7 at 40 weeks. The PGE2 levels in the MNNG-treated group were 44.7 +/- 6.2 at 5 weeks, 43.1 +/- 14.9 at 10 weeks, 70.1 +/- 23.4 at 20 weeks, and 79.7 +/- 54.1 at 40 weeks. The intrinsic PGE2 levels of the noncancerous mucosa were thus significantly higher for the MNNG group than for the control group at all weeks. At 40 weeks, the PGE2 levels of cancer lesions were significantly high compared with those of the noncancerous area. In the cancerous lesions, 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and PGF2 alpha decreased and TXB2 increased significantly at 40 weeks. The observations demonstrated that PGE2 was implicated as a promoter in the development and proliferation of carcinoma in MNNG-induced large bowel carcinogenesis in rats. 
Inverted papilloma of the urinary bladder with granular eosinophilic cells. An unusual neuroendocrine variant. We report the morphologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic characteristics observed in a case of an inverted papilloma that contained neuroendocrine cells resected from the urinary bladder of a 77-year-old woman. Additionally, we evaluated the incidence of neuroendocrine cells in eight cases of inverted papillomas of the urinary bladder obtained from the files of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Washington, DC. To our knowledge, an in-depth study of neuroendocrine cells in this neoplasm and a comparison of the same with neuroendocrine cells observed in other conditions in the lower genitourinary tract have not been previously published, prompting this report. 
Streptococcus salivarius meningitis and colonic carcinoma. Streptococcus salivarius caused fulminant meningitis in an elderly patient. A gastrointestinal diagnostic workup revealed an asymptomatic colonic adenocarcinoma. This first reported instance of S salivarius sepsis associated with a colonic neoplasm is not unexpected, since the organism is bacteriologically similar to S bovis, the prime bacterial indicator of occult malignancy. Exact speciation of streptococcal strains is fraught with technical difficulties, and gastrointestinal investigation may be warranted in an expanded variety of streptococcal infections. 
Spinal cord protection during aortic occlusion: efficacy of intrathecal tetracaine. Spinal cord ischemia and resultant paraplegia are devastating sequelae in up to 40% of patients undergoing repair of thoracoabdominal aneurysms. We investigated the effect of intrathecal tetracaine on the neurological sequelae of spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion with aortic occlusion. Cocaine-derived anesthetics (lidocaine and its analogues) have been shown to decrease neuronal cell metabolism and also have specific neuronal membrane stabilizing effects. New Zealand white rabbits were anesthetized and spinal cord ischemia was then induced by infrarenal aortic occlusion. Animals were divided into six treatment groups. Tetracaine (groups 2 and 4) or normal saline solution (group 5) was administered intrathecally before aortic cross-clamping. Groups 1 and 3 functioned as controls. Group 6 animals received intravenous thiopental. Rabbits were classified as either neurologically normal or injured (paralyzed or paretic). Among controls, 25 minutes of aortic occlusion produced varied neurological sequelae (group 1, 3/6 injured, 50%) whereas 30 minutes resulted in more consistent injury (group 3, 5/6 injured, 83%). All rabbits that received intrathecal saline solution were paralyzed (group 5, 4/4 injured, 100%). Animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion of 30 minutes (group 4) showed significantly better preservation of neurological function (6/7 normal, 86%) than controls and saline-treated animals (groups 3 and 5). All animals treated with intrathecal tetracaine and aortic occlusion for 25 minutes (group 2) showed no signs of injury (5/5 normal, 100%), but this was not significant versus controls (group 1). Intravenous thiopental (group 6, 5/5 injured, 100%) had no beneficial effect. Intrathecal tetracaine significantly and dramatically abrogated the neurological injury secondary to spinal cord ischemia and reperfusion after aortic occlusion at 30 minutes in the rabbit model. 
Could recurrent cholangitis after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy be explained by motor intestinal anomalies? A manometric study. The aim of this study was to describe the motor patterns found in two patients with recurrent cholangitis episodes after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. In one patient, cholangitis was due to a stenosis of the anastomosis between the limb and the left intrahepatic bile duct, while motility of the limb, duodenum, and distal jejunum was normal. In the second patient, no anatomical explanation was found for cholangitis attacks. However, although the duodenal motor activity was normal, the motility of the limb and of the jejunum below the jejunojejunal anastomosis was grossly abnormal: permanent minute rhythm, phase IIIs absent or rare and slowly propagated, all motor abnormalities that could promote bacterial overgrowth in the limb. This stresses the interest in performing motor studies of the Roux-limb when cholangitis remains unexplained after Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. 
Human galanin: molecular cloning reveals a unique structure. Galanin, a novel neuropeptide/hypothalamic hormone originally identified and isolated by virtue of its carboxy-terminal amide group, has recently been shown to have a diverse range of biological activities, including potent effects on the secretion of insulin and growth hormone. The physiological role of galanin remains unclear, with different effects being observed when porcine and rat galanin have been used in various animal model systems and in human studies. Molecular cloning of cDNA encoding human galanin and galanin mRNA associated peptide (GMAP) from both pituitary and neuroblastoma sources has revealed a unique and unexpected structure. In contrast to porcine, bovine and rodent galanin, human galanin lacks a carboxy-terminal amide. By analogy to other neurohormones, the absence of carboxy-terminal amidation would be expected to have significant effects on functional properties such as affinity for different receptor subtypes and physiological half life, and may be responsible for the species specificity observed in the action of galanin. 
Tissue responses to degenerative changes in the temporomandibular joint: a review. The articular cartilage covering of the mandibular condyle and the articular eminence, as well as the tissue of the articular disc, may be affected by degenerative changes associated with osteoarthrosis. Degenerative changes of cartilage alter its physical properties and, as a result, affect its ability to withstand compressive and shearing stresses. Increased friction between the articular surfaces may impair joint movement and may elicit compensatory or pathologic responses of the cartilage and the adjacent tissues, such as capsule and ligaments, synovial membrane, subchondral bone, and associated musculature. In this review, these structural changes are described and related to common signs and symptoms of craniomandibular dysfunction, such as clicking, locking and instability, pain and tenderness, restricted ranges of mandibular motion, crepitation, deformity, muscle wasting, and changes of occlusion. 
Diagnosis and monitoring of subarachnoid hemorrhage by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Thirty-six patients with acute spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (26 caused by rupture of an aneurysm) were examined by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography by using a 2.25-MHz ultrasound transducer. In 20 of these 26 patients (76%), the aneurysm could be identified by a characteristic abnormal blood flow pattern within the aneurysm in coronal and axial scanning planes by transcranial color-coded real-time sonography. Blood within the basal cisterns, on top of the tentorium, and within the ventricles and parenchyma was sonographically detected by increased echodensity in 75%. In addition, cerebrospinal fluid circulation disturbances and cerebral vasospasm were detected in two-dimensional B-mode images in 85% and 100%, respectively. In Doppler mode, intravascular blood flow velocity could be quantified. We conclude that transcranial color-coded real-time sonography, a new, noninvasive method for diagnosis and follow-up of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, allows detection of the primary vascular lesion and monitoring of complications. 
The natural history of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Highly uncommon or highly unrecognized? Among 2000 descendants of an English immigrant to Tasmania, Australia, the diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 was found to be very highly probable or highly probable in 130 and moderately probable in 22. Another 242 children and siblings were 50% likely to have inherited this dominant gene. In all age groups, especially the elderly, the majority of affected members had symptoms of only one endocrine disorder or were asymptomatic. In teenagers, the most common presentation was pituitary lesions and the second most common presentation was insulinomas. Frequently, pituitary lesions or insulinomas developed before any parathyroid lesions could be detected. Elevation of gastrin levels, usually associated with hypercalcemia, was rarely seen in patients younger than 25 years. The classic presentation with symptoms of multiple endocrinopathy may represent only a small fraction of these patients in the community. 
Exacerbation of psoriasis after megavoltage irradiation. The Koebner phenomenon. This is a case report of a patient with a known history of psoriasis who experienced an exacerbation after palliative treatment with high-energy irradiation. A discussion of the radiobiology is presented. 
Right ventricular pacing and left ventricular filling pattern. An echo-Doppler study. The influence of right ventricular pacing on left ventricular filling has not been completely clarified. The aim of the study was to analyze the possible alteration in and effects on left ventricular filling resulting from right ventricular pacing. The study population consisted of two groups; group A was comprised of 12 patients with a spontaneous left bundle branch block, and group B had 12 patients without left bundle branch block. All the patients underwent an interrogation of the mitral valve inflow by Doppler echocardiography, in order to measure isovolumic relaxation time, early and late peak velocity (E and A wave), E/A ratio and deceleration time. The study was performed at spontaneous rhythm and after, inhibition of the pacemaker. In group A, there were no changes in the Doppler parameters when passing from a spontaneous to an 80/min electrically induced rhythm. Analysis of group B revealed a statistically significant lengthening of IVR and Dec t with electrical stimulation. No statistically significant differences were found when we compared the Doppler parameters of the two populations at the same pacing frequency. Right ventricular pacing causes interventricular asynchrony and abnormalities in diastolic filling times, which resulted in a lengthening of either IVR and Dec t, simulating a pattern of abnormal relaxation. 
Malignant colorectal strictures in Crohn's disease. One hundred thirty-two of 980 patients (13.5%) with Crohn's disease (CD) involving the colon, admitted to The Mount Sinai Hospital between 1959 and 1985, developed 175 colonic strictures. Thirty-three patients developed more than one stricture. The frequency was twice as great in colitis (19%) as in ileocolitis (11%). Ten malignant strictures were identified in nine patients (three ileocolitis, six colitis). One of these patients had three strictures (two malignant, and one benign), and two had two strictures (one malignant and one benign). The frequency of cancer in patients with stricture (6.8%) was higher than in those without stricture (0.7%, six of 848, p less than 0.001). There were no differences in clinical symptoms between patients with benign and malignant stricture. Seventeen of 165 benign strictures (10.3%) were long, extending over more than one anatomical segment of colon, but all 10 malignant strictures were short (p less than 0.0001). The age at the diagnosis of stricture was higher in the nine patients with malignant stricture than in the 123 patients with benign stricture (mean age 57.2 vs. 41.4 yr, respectively, p less than 0.01). The proportion of strictures that were malignant increased with duration of disease from 3.3% with less than 20 yr of CD, to 11% with CD of 20 yr or more. All nine patients with malignant stricture were treated surgically, and four of the nine died of colon cancer during a mean follow-up of 4.3 yr. Prognosis was worse in six other nonstricture cancers in this series, with five colon cancer deaths during mean follow-up of 1.6 yr. In view of the high rate of malignancy, 6.8% in this series, colonoscopy with biopsy is essential in Crohn's disease patients with colonic strictures, and surgery must be considered when a stricture cannot be fully assessed during colonoscopy. 
Drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst: an unusual complication. A 34-year-old white woman had external drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst. During sinography, contrast medium filled perigastric varices, causing septic shock. From this experience, we believe that although sinograms are helpful, they should be preceded by prophylactic administration of antibiotics and that contrast material should be sterile. The drainage catheter should be removed as soon as possible. 
Kistrin, a polypeptide platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist, enhances and sustains coronary arterial thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator in a canine preparation BACKGROUND. Kistrin is a 68-amino acid polypeptide from the venom of the Malayan pit viper Agkistrodon rhodostoma, which inhibits the platelet GPIIb/IIIa receptor. Its effect on thrombolysis, reocclusion, and bleeding associated with administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was studied in a canine model of coronary artery thrombosis. METHODS AND RESULTS. Coronary patency was monitored for 2 hours by ultrasonic flow probe and repeated coronary angiography. The rt-PA was given as 0.45-mg/kg bolus injections at 15-minute intervals until recanalization or to a maximum of four boluses. Four groups of four or five dogs were studied: a control group that received intravenous heparin (4,000-unit bolus and 1,000 units each hour) and three groups that received heparin and 0.48, 0.24, or 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, administered as a 10% bolus injection and an infusion during a 60-minute period. In the control group, reflow occurred in four of five dogs within 37 +/- 47 minutes but was followed by cyclic reflow and reocclusion. Kistrin at a dose of 0.48 and 0.24 mg/kg reduced the time to reflow to 6 +/- 5 and 10 +/- 3 minutes, respectively, and abolished reocclusion. With 0.12 mg/kg kistrin, reflow occurred in all four animals, within 27 +/- 23 minutes, and reocclusion occurred in two animals. Kistrin induced a dose-related prolongation of the template bleeding time: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, the bleeding time was prolonged from 3.8 +/- 1.3 minutes before infusion to 29 +/- 2 minutes during infusion, but it was shortened to 8.3 +/- 2.6 minutes at 90 minutes after the end of infusion. Kistrin also caused a dose-related inhibition of platelet aggregation with ADP and collagen: with 0.48 mg/kg kistrin, platelet aggregation was abolished during the infusion but had partially recovered toward the end of the observation period. Pathological examination of recanalized coronary arterial segments of dogs given 0.48 or 0.24 mg/kg kistrin revealed widely patent arteries with some platelets layered on the damaged intimal surface. CONCLUSIONS. Kistrin increases the rate and extent of thrombolysis with a reduced dose of rt-PA, and it prevents reocclusion. At an effective dose, it is associated with a transient prolongation of the bleeding time and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Kistrin may offer promise as adjunctive treatment to thrombolytic agents in patients with acute myocardial infarction. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of Ewing's sarcoma cell surface antigen p30/32MIC2. Monoclonal antibody (MAb) HBA71, which was raised against Ewing's sarcoma cells, recognizes a cell-surface glycoprotein, p30/32MIC2, that is encoded by the MIC2 gene in the pseudoautosomal region of human chromosomes X and Y. This immunohistochemical study evaluates the specificity and sensitivity of MAb HBA71 for tumor diagnosis. Frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues of more than 300 tumors of diverse histologic type, including more than 100 small round cell tumors of childhood and adolescence, were tested with this MAb by the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase procedure. The authors found HBA71 immunoreactivity in 61 of 63 Ewing's sarcomas studied and 9 of 11 primitive neuroectodermal tumors and peripheral neuroepitheliomas. HBA71-negative tumors included neuroblastomas (0 of 24), melanomas (0 of 13), an esthesioneuroblastoma, small cell osteosarcomas (0 of 2), a malignant ectomesenchymoma, desmoplastic SRCT (0 of 5), and medulloblastomas (0 of 5). Heterogeneous expression of HBA71 immunostaining was found in some embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas (3 of 14) and astrocytomas (4 of 7), and in a few neuroendocrine tumors (4 of 26), carcinomas (3 of 94), and lymphomas (6 of 30). Because Ewing's sarcomas are consistently HBA71 positive, the authors searched for antigen-positive normal cells that may represent precursors for these tumors; however, no obvious candidate for the elusive cell of origin for Ewing's sarcoma was identified in the normal fetal tissues tested. Their findings indicate that HBA71 is a highly restricted cell-surface antigen of Ewing's sarcomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and immunohistochemistry employing this antibody may be of value in the differential diagnosis of selected small round cell tumors in childhood and adolescence. 
The significance of critical care errors in causing preventable death in trauma patients in a trauma system. The regionalization of trauma care has led to a decrease in preventable death after injury. This decrease has been attributed to earlier resuscitation and surgical intervention. Little emphasis, however, has focused on the critical care phase of trauma patient management. This study was undertaken to determine the significance of critical care errors (CCEs) on preventable mortality and morbidity in a regionalized system of trauma care. The records of 12,910 trauma patients admitted to six trauma centers over a three-year period were reviewed. The cause and preventability of death was determined by a panel of trauma experts. Critical care errors occurred in 151 (23%) of all patients with errors occurring during any phase of care. The CCEs were identified in 38 of 125 (30%) deaths of patients with errors in some phase of care. The CCEs were implicated as the cause of death in 30 (48%) of the 62 preventable deaths. The proportion of preventable deaths attributable to CCEs was higher than the proportion of preventable death attributable to errors in the resuscitative and operative phases of care (p less than 0.001, chi-square). These data indicate that CCEs significantly contribute to preventable mortality and morbidity in trauma patients. It is imperative that physicians caring for trauma patients possess expertise in the critical care management of injured patients. 
Stump pressure, the contralateral carotid artery, and electroencephalographic changes. Electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring and measurement of stump pressure are the most widely employed methods of assessing the risk of cerebral ischemia during carotid endarterectomy. The status of the contralateral carotid artery has also been thought to influence the need for placing a shunt. The relationship of EEG monitoring, stump pressure, and the contralateral carotid artery has not been completely delineated. We retrospectively reviewed these three variables in 113 patients undergoing 124 carotid endarterectomies. The contralateral artery was classified as occluded, stenotic (greater than 50% decrease in diameter), or nonstenotic. There was a 48% incidence of EEG changes with contralateral occlusion, 18% with stenosis, and 21% with nonstenotic arteries (p = 0.014). There was a 73% incidence of EEG changes when the stump pressure was less than 25 mm Hg, 32% when the stump pressure was 25 to 50 mm Hg, and 2% when the stump pressure was greater than 50 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). There was no significant difference in the mean stump pressure for patients with occlusion (43.8 mm Hg), stenosis (44.7 mm Hg), or nonstenotic contralateral arteries (51.3 mm Hg). All patients with contralateral occlusion and a stump pressure less than 25 mm Hg had EEG changes. No patient with a stump pressure greater than 50 mm Hg and a patent contralateral artery had EEG changes. Although the incidence of EEG changes in the majority of patients was not accurately predicted by the stump pressure and the status of the contralateral carotid artery, stump pressure less than or equal to 50 mm Hg was sensitive, identifying 97% of patients with EEG changes. 
Left atrial ball thrombus: review of clinical and echocardiographic manifestations with suggestions for management. Left atrial ball thrombus is an infrequent clinical syndrome, which can have a catastrophic outcome but can be readily treated when recognized. It is usually a complication of long-standing rheumatic mitral stenosis. Symptomatic presentation is variable: fragmentation of the thrombus followed by peripheral embolization will produce ischemia or infarction of myocardium, brain, viscera, or extremities; random, intermittent, partial, or total occlusion of the mitral valve orifice may cause syncope, pulmonary congestion, and occasionally sudden death in other patients. Embolic and obstructive phenomena may also occur together. Cardiac physical findings usually suggest mitral stenosis; variability in the intensity of the diastolic rumble is common. Two-dimensional echocardiography is the gold standard for identifying ball thrombus. Cardiac catheterization provides assessment of coronary artery status when needed. The outcome of untreated ball thrombus is unlikely to be favorable. The results of anticoagulation and thrombolysis are unpredictable and potentially as harmful as no treatment at all. Current evidence although scant suggests that prompt surgical removal of the free thrombus, often in conjunction with mitral valve repair or replacement, is the appropriate therapeutic course in most patients. 
Sudden asphyxial death due to a prolapsed esophageal fibrolipoma. Fibrolipomas of the esophagus are extremely uncommon benign tumors. Accurate diagnosis and resection are essential, due to their tendency to become impacted and obstruct the airway. The case is presented of a 56-year-old man who died suddenly of asphyxia because of upper airway obstruction by a prolapsed fibrolipoma of the esophagus. 
Left and right ventricular systolic function and exercise capacity with coronary artery disease. This prospective study of symptom-limited supine ergometry was conducted to determine the contributions of right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) systolic function to the exercise capacity of a cohort of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients with unstable angina, angiographically proven CAD (n = 53) and stable symptoms after medical therapy or angioplasty were included. Documented myocardial infarction (greater than or equal to 2 weeks before exercise) was present in 43 of 53 patients. Angina was the limiting symptom in 11 of 53; the other 42 stopped exercise with dyspnea or fatigue, or both. Oxygen consumption was measured on-line during exercise with a metabolic cart. RV ejection fraction and LV ejection fraction were measured by validated methods from gated blood pool radionuclide ventriculography. There were weak but statistically significant correlations between exercise oxygen consumption and exercise RV ejection fraction (r = 0.30, p less than 0.05) and between exercise oxygen consumption and exercise LV ejection fraction (r = 0.38, p less than 0.01). Multivariate regression analysis, including exercise RV ejection fraction, exercise LV ejection fraction and exercise heart rate versus exercise oxygen consumption revealed a better relation (r = 0.48, p less than 0.005) than any variable in univariate regression. The values of RV and LV ejection fraction at rest did not correlate significantly (r = 0.2, difference not significant), but the exercise values did correlate weakly (r = 0.41, p less than 0.01). The reserve of LV ejection fraction, defined as exercise minus rest value, correlated weakly with exercise oxygen consumption (r = 0.32, p less than 0.05). 
Resection of the inferior vena cava or intraluminal vena caval tumor thrombectomy during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for metastatic germ cell cancer: indications and results. A total of 42 patients underwent inferior vena caval resection (40) or intraluminal tumor thrombectomy (2) during retroperitoneal lymph node dissection for bulky abdominal metastatic nonseminomatous germ cell cancer (7% of all post-chemotherapy retroperitoneal lymph node dissection cases). The 3 indications for vena caval resection included tumor clearance (38%), vena caval scar occlusion (14%) and vena caval tumor thrombus (48%). En bloc vena caval resection to achieve tumor clearance was justified by subsequent nodal pathology (cancer in 63% of the specimens and teratoma in 31%). Vena caval resection in the presence of scar occlusion was de facto required by virtue of its incorporation in the specimen. Vena caval resection or thrombectomy is indicated for intraluminal tumor thrombus because thrombus pathology (cancer 35%, teratoma 45% and fibrosis 20%) reflected nodal pathology in 71% of the patients with cancer, 78% with teratoma and 100% with fibrosis. The complications of vena caval resection were generally transitory. The 71% survival rate justifies this intensive surgical approach because these patients had exhausted all chemotherapy options. 
Transplant aspiration cytology: applications to kidney and liver transplantations. In summary, cytologic monitoring of renal and liver transplants is a well established diagnostic procedure. The prime value of the FNAB relates to the posttransplantation perioperative period: the acute alterations in the transplant, such as acute rejection and the differential diagnoses, can be established in most cases. However, evaluation of vascular patterns of rejection, in particular chronic rejection, is impossible to obtain from the FNAB. A needle core biopsy is needed. 
Influence of the site of tumor growth on the capacity of a low tumorigenic line of Friend erythroleukemia cells to differentiate. Friend erythroleukemia cells (FLC) passaged in mice are highly tumorigenic and multiply extensively in the livers of suckling DBA/2 mice without differentiating. In contrast, in vitro passaged FLCs injected intravenously were of low tumorigenicity, multiplied to a limited extent in the livers of suckling mice, and underwent marked differentiation from the proerythroblast to the orthochromatic erythroblast stage in the liver. The presence of characteristic C-type virions budding from the cell surface in various stages of erythroid differentiation served as a marker of the injected FLCs. When the same in vitro passaged FLCs that differentiated in the liver were injected subcutaneously in suckling mice, they formed large subcutaneous tumors consisting of sheets of undifferentiated tumor cells. It is concluded that the tumorigenicity of FLCs depended on the site of tumor growth and that there is an inverse correlation between the tumorigenic capacity and the capacity to differentiate. 
Airway pressure release ventilation in severe acute respiratory failure Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV), a new ventilatory support technique, was compared with conventional intermittent positive-pressure ventilation plus PEEP (CPPV) in 18 patients with severe acute respiratory failure. Patients were initially stabilized on CPPV and then switched to APRV. The APRV provided effective ventilatory support in 17 of 18 patients; APRV achieved similar levels of alveolar ventilation as CPPV (for APRV, mean PaCO2 = 45.0 +/- 6.2 mm Hg; vs for CPPV, mean PaCO2 = 43.3 +/- 5.7 mm Hg), with significantly lower mean maximum airway pressures (38.9 +/- 10.1 cm H2O vs 64.6 +/- 15.4 cm H2O; p = 0.0001) and mean VT (0.79 +/- 0.11 L vs 1.05 +/- 0.15 L; p = 0.0002). No significant differences in mean airway pressure, end-expiratory pressure, FIO2, ventilator rate, arterial blood gas levels, and hemodynamic function were noted between APRV and CPPV. 
Left-sided pleural effusion secondary to splenic vein thrombosis. A previously unrecognized relationship. The association of left-sided pleural effusion and subcapsular splenic hematoma was reported in 1980. We describe a patient in whom a left-sided pleural effusion resulted from splenic vein thrombosis, a relationship not previously reported. Splenectomy was performed, demonstrating the spleen to be enlarged and hemorrhagic. The pleural effusion did not recur after splenectomy. The three effusions due to splenic hematomas reported previously cleared only after splenectomy, suggesting splenectomy may be necessary to prevent reaccumulation. We propose possible pathophysiologic mechanisms and recommend that splenic vein thrombosis be considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained left-sided pleural effusions. 
Hypocalciuria of preeclampsia is independent of parathyroid hormone level. Hypocalciuria is a feature of preeclampsia. The roles of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D 1,25(OH)2D3 (calcitriol) in its pathogenesis have not yet been determined. Fourteen preeclamptic women were compared with 12 women with chronic hypertension and 11 normotensives, all in the third trimester. Preeclamptics had the lowest urinary calcium excretion rate (62.1 +/- 32.8 mg/24 hours) compared with chronic hypertensive women (162.6 +/- 97.8 mg/24 hours) and normotensive controls (225.6 = 146.9 mg/24 hours) (P less than .05). Serum PTH was lowest in preeclamptics (9.8 +/- 5.5 pg/mL), in contrast to the chronic hypertensives (18.5 +/- 2.7 pg/mL) and normotensives (16.4 +/- 3.2 pg/mL) (P less than .005). Similarly, urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) excretion was 2.9 +/- 1.4 mumol/24 hours in the preeclamptics, 5.1 +/- 1.7 mumol/24 hours in the chronic hypertensives, and 4.6 +/- 1.3 mumol/24 hours in the normotensive group (P less than .05). These data suggest that the mechanism of hypocalciuria in preeclampsia is independent of the PTH-calcitriol axis. Therefore, it is suggested that the hypocalciuria of preeclampsia is due to intrinsic renal tubular dysfunction. 
Development of sustained achlorhydria in a patient with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated with omeprazole. Spontaneous remission of gastric acid hypersecretion in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome occurs rarely. This study shows the development of gastric secretory mucosal atrophy resulting in achlorhydria and loss of pepsin secretion in a 63-year-old woman with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Reduced secretion began soon after starting treatment with omeprazole, and achlorhydria became complete 6 months later. The patient remains well with normal endoscopy results and is achlorhydric 4 years after the start of treatment and 34 months after stopping omeprazole. She was not colonized with Helicobacter pylori until 36 months after developing achlorhydria. Serum gastrin has increased from 1000 to between 5000 and 12,500 ng/L (pg/mL), was not suppressible by gastric acidification, and was not associated with G-cell hyperplasia. She also has a normal Schilling test and normal immunoglobulins, and lacks antibodies to parietal cells or H+, K(+)-ATPase. Moderate enterochromaffinlike cell hyperplasia is apparent for the first time on the latest biopsy sample. 
Acetylcholine receptor-reactive T lymphocytes from healthy subjects and myasthenia gravis patients. Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 23 of 114 (20%) myasthenia gravis (MG) patients showed positive T-cell proliferative responses to native acetylcholine receptor (AChR) purified from the electric fish Torpedo, compared with two of 25 (8%) healthy or other neurologic disease controls. Responsiveness appeared to fluctuate seasonally. Long-term T-cell lines and clones could be selected as readily from the two healthy responders as from the MG cases and showed similar culture behavior, CD4+ phenotype, and HLA class II restrictions. One clone from a control cross-reacted with recombinant human AChR alpha chain (r37-429A) and with the synthetic peptide 125-143(S-S) from its sequence. Both these human antigens stimulated primary proliferative responses at substantially higher frequencies (26 to 59%) than native xeno-AChR--in both patients and controls--demonstrating that truly autoreactive T cells are not inevitably deleted during normal T-cell development. 
Evaluation of pulmonary venous flow by transesophageal echocardiography in subjects with a normal heart: comparison with transthoracic echocardiography Nineteen normal subjects and five patients with atrial fibrillation underwent transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiographic studies to evaluate the normal pulmonary venous flow pattern, compare right and left pulmonary venous flow and assess the effect of sample volume location on pulmonary venous flow velocities. Best quality tracings were obtained by transesophageal echocardiography. Anterograde flow during systole and diastole was observed in all patients by both techniques. Reversed flow during atrial contraction was observed with transesophageal echocardiography in 18 of the 19 subjects in normal sinus rhythm, but in only 7 subjects with transthoracic echocardiography. Two forward peaks during ventricular systole were clearly identified in 14 subjects (73%) with transesophageal echocardiography, but in none with the transthoracic technique. The early systolic wave immediately followed the reversed flow during atrial contraction and was strongly related to the timing of atrial contraction (r = 0.78; p less than 0.001), but not to the timing of ventricular contraction, and appeared to be secondary to atrial relaxation. Conversely, the late systolic wave was temporally related to ventricular ejection (r = 0.66; p less than 0.001), peaking 100 ms before the end of the aortic valve closure and was unrelated to atrial contraction time. Quantitatively, significantly higher peak systolic flow velocities were obtained in the left upper pulmonary vein compared with the right upper pulmonary vein (60 +/- 17 vs. 52 +/- 15 cm/s; p less than 0.05) and by transesophageal echocardiography compared with transthoracic studies (60 +/- 17 vs. 50 +/- 14 cm/s; p less than 0.05). Increasing depth of interrogation beyond 1 cm from the vein orifice resulted in a significant decrease in the number of interpretable tracings. 
Delayed presentation and treatment of popliteal artery embolism. In the course of reviewing a 10-year experience with popliteal artery embolism (PAE), two distinct patterns of clinical presentation were identified. In addition to those patients presenting with typical acute (symptom duration less than 7 days) arterial ischemia, a second group was identified who presented with more chronic symptoms. The present study was conducted to contrast the clinical factors and treatment of these two temporal patterns of presentation with PAE. Sixty PAEs in 58 patients were documented by the combination of angiography and/or exploration of the popliteal artery. Acute presentation (AP) was seen in 41 (68%) of these and delayed presentation (DP) was noted in 19 (32%) patients. Delayed presentation patients typically presented with a history of sudden onset of claudication or rest pain and a median symptom duration of 30 days. Eighty per cent of AP patients presented with immediately threatened limbs. Angiography was generally diagnostic of chronic popliteal embolism. In the acute group, 90% were treated with embolectomy alone, while 20% of the DP group required bypass grafting. However in two thirds of the DP group, embolectomy alone performed through a direct popliteal approach was possible. Current results with overall limb salvage (92%) and mortality (7%) represents a substantial improvement compared to the authors' previous experience with PAE. The current study suggests that as many as one third of patients with popliteal artery embolism may present in delayed fashion with chronic symptoms. Furthermore most of these patients can be treated with direct popliteal embolectomy alone with favorable results. 
Local cardiac responses--alternative methods of control. Much attention has been paid to the influence of the beta-adrenoceptor system on cardiac function in heart failure. Full agonists and partial agonists acting on cardiac beta 1 receptors have been widely investigated, as has the density of these receptors in the failing heart. However, other cardiac control mechanisms may play important roles in the normal heart as well as in heart failure. The Frank-Starling mechanism of enhanced cardiac contraction produced by mechanical stretching of the ventricular myofibrils is well known. When treating patients with heart failure with diuretics, vasodilators and other drugs that influence preload, it is important to consider their overall effects in relation to the Starling curves. Atrial stretching also produces compensatory responses which are currently being intensively studied. Reflex release of atrial natriuretic factor after stimulation of atrial receptors has important physiologic effects in heart failure. The atria, but not the ventricles, are innervated by the vagus; the influence of the parasympathetic nervous system on the heart and circulation is often overlooked. The initial increase in heart rate during exercise is primarily due to withdrawal of vagal influence. Besides acetylcholine, the parasympathetic transmitter, many other local hormones may affect cardiac function; these include prostaglandins, 5-hydroxytryptamine and histamine. Although the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is mediated primarily through beta 1 adrenoceptors, both beta 2 and alpha receptors are also found in the heart. Myocardial alpha 1 receptors, which mediate a positive inotropic effect, have been identified, and prejunctional alpha 2 receptors may mediate inhibition of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerves. 
Quantitative bone and 67Ga scintigraphy in the differentiation of necrotizing external otitis from severe external otitis. Qualitative technetium Tc 99m bone scintigraphy using phosphate compounds and gallium 67 scintigraphy were described as a helpful means in diagnosing necrotizing external otitis (NEO). They were, however, claimed to be nonspecific. Quantitative Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy and gallium 67 scintigraphy were performed in eight patients with NEO and in 20 patients with severe external otitis, in order to prove usefulness of scintigraphy in the diagnosis of NEO. Ratios of lesion to nonlesion for bone scintigraphy were 1.67 +/- 0.16 in patients with NEO and 1.08 +/- 0.09 in patients with severe external otitis, and for gallium 67 scintigraphy they were 1.35 +/- 0.24 in NEO patients and 1.05 +/- 0.03 in patients with severe external otitis. There was no difference in uptake between diabetic patients with severe external otitis and nondiabetic patients. The scintigraphic studies were also evaluated using a qualitative scoring method (scores 0 to +4), according to the intensity of the radiopharmaceutical uptake. This method was found to be inferior in the diagnosis of NEO compared with the quantitative method. We conclude that lesion-to-nonlesion ratios greater than 1.5 and 1.3 on bone and gallium 67 scintigraphy, respectively, are indicative of NEO. Quantitative bone scintigraphy, which is quicker to perform, may be used as a single imaging modality for the diagnosis of NEO. 
Primary angiosarcoma of the seminal vesicle. We report on an unusual case of primary angiosarcoma of the seminal vesicle. Diagnosis was confirmed by light and electron microscopy, as well as specific immunohistochemical staining. This rare tumor is highly aggressive, and refractory to traditional surgical and adjuvant therapeutic modalities. Sarcomatous lesions of the seminal vesicle are reviewed. 
Human T-lymphotropic virus type I screening in volunteer blood donors--United States, 1989. On November 29, 19898, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued recommendations to screen all whole blood donations in the United States for human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1). This report summarizes results of the first 13 months of screening (December 1988 through December 1989) by the American Red Cross (ARC) and the Council of Community Blood Centers (CCBC). 
Duodenal ulcer and Sjogren's syndrome in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis: a casual association? Peptic ulcer has been reported in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), but its frequency and pathogenesis are still poorly defined. We have analyzed the occurrence of duodenal ulcer in 37 female patients affected by PBC and in 35 with chronic liver disease of various etiologies. An active ulcer was found in seven patients with PBC and in one with chronic autoimmune hepatitis. The presence of an exocrine gland defect, as indicated by clinical signs of Sjogren's syndrome (SS), was found in six patients with PBC and duodenal ulcer (85%), but in only eight (26.6%) of those without ulcer (p less than 0.02). Therefore, in our patients, duodenal ulcer occurs more often in PBC than in other types of chronic liver disease. The association of SS with PBC, significantly higher in patients with than without ulcer, supports the hypothesis that the underlying exocrine gland defect is involved in the development of duodenal ulcer. 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. As clinical experience with patients with ZES has grown, increasing recognition has been made of the broad spectrum of symptoms associated with gastrinomas. Diarrhea and acid-induced esophageal injury have taken their place alongside chronic peptic ulcer disease as indications for screening for gastrinoma. Diagnostic testing should begin with fasting serum gastrin levels and should include intravenous secretin infusion if fasting serum levels of gastrin are nondiagnostic and the patient is not found to be hypochlorhydric. Tumor localization is critical to aid in the identification of patients with potentially curable localized disease. Preoperative evaluation utilizing CT scanning with intravenous contrast should be done early and should be supplemented by other imaging modalities as necessary. Exploratory laparotomy, including a thorough examination of the duodenum and perhaps intraoperative ultrasound, should be performed in all patients with sporadic gastrinoma who lack evidence of extensive metastatic disease on preoperative evaluation. By utilizing this approach, it is likely that at least 20% of patients with ZES can be cured. With the availability of the highly effective H(+)-K(+)-ATPase inhibitor omeprazole, excellent control of symptoms related to gastric acid hypersecretion can be expected. Patients with unresectable gastrinoma may thus avoid potentially morbid antisecretory surgery and be managed with a fairly simple medical regimen. Further developments in the chemotherapeutic management of these patients with unresectable disease should be forthcoming in the future. 
Left anterior fascicular block: an ischaemic response during treadmill testing. A patient in whom exercise induced reversible ischaemic left anterior fascicular block is reported. Glyceryl trinitrate relieved the fascicular block. Coronary angiography showed a 90% obstruction of the left anterior descending artery. The left anterior fascicular block induced by exercise disappeared after a successful coronary angioplasty. 
Cytomegalovirus appendicitis in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. We report a homosexual patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and histopathologic evidence for cytomegalovirus (CMV) appendicitis in a patient with no prior history of CMV infection. The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain and intermittent fevers. The diagnosis of appendicitis was difficult to make in this patient because of the presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis ileitis and the frequent presentation of abdominal pain with fever in AIDS patients. Although CMV colitis is frequently seen in AIDS patients, the prevalence of CMV appendicitis is exceedingly rare. The problems related to making a diagnosis of CMV appendicitis and the therapeutic management of CMV infections are reviewed. 
Ten years after cryosurgical treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. From 1974 to 1977 we treated 96 patients for grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with cryotherapy. They were monitored for 10 to 14 years with an attendance rate of 98%. Treatment resulted in cure in 92%. Nine patients had persisting lesions, and three patients had a recurrent lesion. The last recurrence was diagnosed 6.7 years after cryotherapy. 
Use of fluorescent in situ hybridization for marker chromosome identification in congenital and neoplastic disorders. Identifying marker chromosomes of unknown origin in the clinical cytogenetics laboratory has been a problem historically, despite advances in specialized staining techniques. Determination of the origin of these marker chromosomes in patients with congenital or malignant neoplastic disorders is essential for more complete diagnosis, counseling, and treatment. The authors describe the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific alpha-satellite DNA probes to identify the origin of marker chromosomes in two patients with congenital disorders and three patients with malignant neoplastic disorders. The impact of firm identification of the marker chromosome for the diagnosis of these patients is discussed. The authors also discuss the feasibility of using this technique routinely in the clinical cytogenetics laboratory. 
Milrinone, a bridge to heart transplantation. We describe the use of a milrinone infusion as a bridge to heart transplantation in the treatment of severe congestive cardiac failure secondary to viral cardiomyopathy. The clinical improvement that occurred when milrinone was commenced made it possible to wean the patient from conventional cardiovascular support with an intra-aortic balloon pump and dobutamine. There was an improvement in organ perfusion. 
In situ evidence for HPV 16, 18, 33 integration in cervical squamous cell cancer in Britain and South Africa. In a previous study three types of HPV signal were described in CIN. It was suggested that a type 1 signal represented episomal HPV while a type 2 signal represented integrated HPV; and a type 3 signal was indicative of both episomal and integrated HPV. To test this hypothesis 91 squamous cell cancers (SCC) of the cervix from Britain and South Africa were examined for HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35. Of the South African group (n = 69) 64% contained HPV types 16 (n = 29) and 18 (n = 15). The SCC in the British group (n = 22) contained HPV 16 and HPV 33 in 12 and three cases, respectively. Of the HPV positive biopsy specimens, 86% showed a type 2 signal in keratinising and non-keratinising tumours and the remainder a type 3 signal. Type 3 signal was present only in keratinising tumours. The presence of punctate signal in 100% of HPV containing SCC, together with localisation of HPV signal to sister chromatids in tumour cell mitotic figures in vivo, provides further evidence for type 2, and the punctate component of type 3 signal representing viral integration. 
Changes in the serum levels of CK-MB, LDH, LDH1, SGOT and myoglobin due to cardiac surgery. Elevation of serum levels of enzymes due to myocardial necrosis is considered to be a specific finding for myocardial infarction. This study was designed to determine the changes in the levels of LDH, SGOT enzymes, LDH1, CK-MB isoenzymes and myoglobin in patients who have had coronary bypass grafting and who have had atriotomy for surgical correction without any evidence of myocardial infarction diagnosed by clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic findings. It was found that CK-MB, LDH, LDH1 and myoglobin showed significant elevations which mimicked a perioperative myocardial infarction. SGOT also increased, but remained within the normal range. CK-MB, LDH and LDH1 increased more in the coronary bypass grafted patients whereas myoglobin increased in the patients who had atriotomies. It was concluded that in order to demonstrate a perioperative myocardial infarction it is necessary to determine at least two of these enzymes for a long period and to correlate these results with the clinical, hemodynamic and electrocardiographic findings. 
Unusual presentations of duodenal tuberculosis. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is still rampant in underdeveloped countries and can mimic other gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. Herein we report four cases of isolated proximal duodenal tuberculosis, without involvement of other parts of the GI tract. The clinical presentation in three of them resembled that of peptic ulcer disease, and one had features of gastric outlet obstruction. On investigation, one of these patients had a pyeloduodenal fistula. The limitations of clinical evaluation, radiology, and endoscopy are stressed, and the value of surgical biopsy is highlighted. 
Antegrade approach to radical retropubic prostatectomy in patients with difficult apical dissection. Among 335 radical retropubic prostatectomies an antegrade dissection was used in 30 because of difficulty in developing the usual planes of dissection during apical dissection. The adequacy of tumor resection, preservation of sexual potency and urinary continence were compared in patients who underwent the antegrade dissection and those who underwent the standard retrograde nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy. Histopathological evaluation revealed no significant difference in the over-all completeness of tumor excision between the group having an antegrade dissection (16 of 30, 53% completely excised) and those having a retrograde dissection (177 of 305, 58% completely excised) (p = 0.62). Patients with clinically localized but pathological stage C disease undergoing an antegrade dissection and a nerve-sparing procedure had a significantly higher incidence of positive lateral margins (9 of 12, 75%) than the comparable group undergoing a retrograde dissection (40 of 99, 40%) (p = 0.02). The incidence of positive apical margins was similar in both groups, with 5 of 14 (36%) of the antegrade stage C cases (36%) having positive apical margins compared to 37 of 117 of the retrograde stage C cases (32%) (p = 0.65). Sexual potency was preserved in 5 of 6 patients (83%) treated with an antegrade dissection who had both neurovascular bundles preserved and were followed for at least 6 months, compared to 86 of 142 (61%) who underwent retrograde dissection (difference not significant, p = 0.26). Potency was preserved in 6 of 13 evaluable patients (46%) undergoing unilateral antegrade nerve-sparing procedure compared to 21 of 48 evaluable patients (44%) undergoing unilateral retrograde nerve-sparing procedure (p = 0.88). Of 22 patients followed for 1 year 21 (95%) have regained urinary continence. We conclude that the antegrade approach to radical retropubic prostatectomy provides results that are comparable to those achieved with the standard retrograde approach but that when an antegrade approach is chosen because of periprostatic fibrosis, bilateral preservation of the neurovascular bundles may result in a higher incidence of positive surgical margins. 
Asthma in the emergency department: impact of a protocol on optimizing therapy. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of a simple educational intervention on the prescribing habits of internal medicine residents in the treatment of acute asthma in a busy emergency department (ED). Prescribing habits for 16 residents were documented for 4 months. The first 2 months served as a control period during which eight residents managed asthma patients without the benefit of any specific educational intervention beyond standard department protocols. A total of 129 patients treated by the residents during this initial phase were assessed. During the second 2-month period, a 10-minute verbal presentation and explicit written treatment protocol were provided to another eight residents, and their treatment of 83 patients was covertly evaluated. Increased prescribing of desired therapy was significantly improved in every area except that of prescribing an inhaled steroid metered dose inhaler for use as a discharge medication. The 10-minute verbal presentation given in conjunction with a three-page handout was found to be highly effective for eliciting improvement in treatment practices during short clinical rotations. The duration of this effect beyond each rotation is unknown. This educational intervention should be presented by the ED medical director, clinical pharmacist, or other appropriate clinician in virtually any ED as quality of patient care can be dramatically improved. 
Low peptic ulcer and high gastric cancer prevalence in a developing country with a high prevalence of infection by Helicobacter pylori. We compared the prevalence rates of peptic ulcer (duodenal and gastric) and gastric cancer in 1,796 dyspeptic Peruvian patients with those reported in 2,883 similar patients from developed countries. The prevalence of total peptic ulcer was significantly lower, and that of gastric cancer significantly higher, in the Peruvian patients. The prevalence of gastric ulcer was lower but not significantly so. We deduced that the significantly lower prevalence of total peptic ulcer was directly related to the low prevalence rate of duodenal ulcer. We hypothesize that the reason for these differences was probably a higher prevalence of Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic atrophic gastritis with hypochlorhydria in the Peruvian patients. Hypochlorhydria decreases the predisposition to peptic ulcer (especially duodenal ulcer), and chronic atrophic gastritis may predispose an individual to gastric cancer. 
Psychosis following temporal lobe surgery: a report of six cases. Six consecutive patients who had had temporal lobe surgery for epilepsy, and been referred for psychiatric assessment of psychotic symptoms, are reported. Their symptoms (a delusional depression, four schizophrenia-like illnesses, and a case of Capgras' syndrome) are discussed in relation to the possible role of their operations, all of which were on the right hemisphere. 
Quality of life after proctocolectomy. A comparison of Brooke ileostomy, Kock pouch, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. Recent work has shown that patients undergoing proctocolectomy and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis experience a better quality of life than those undergoing proctocolectomy and Brooke ileostomy. To assess whether the improvement with the pouch is due to the absence of a stoma or the preservation of fecal continence, functional and performance activities were assessed in 406 patients with Brooke ileostomies (stoma present, incontinent), 313 with Kock pouches (stoma present, continent), and 298 with ileal pouch-anal anastomoses (stoma absent, continent). All patients underwent proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis. After adjusting for age, sex, diagnosis, attitude towards the operation, dietary satisfaction, and ability to work, the likelihood of an impact on performance was estimated for the three types of operation using logistic regression analysis. Patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomoses had fewer restrictions in sports and sexual activities than those with Kock pouches (P less than 0.05), whereas those with Kock pouches in turn had fewer restrictions in these activities but more restrictions in travel than those with Brooke ileostomies (P less than 0.05). In contrast, performance in the categories of social life, recreation, work, and family was similar between groups. It is concluded that both the presence of a stoma and fecal incontinence impair the quality of life after proctocolectomy. Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, which avoids both stoma and incontinence, offers the best quality of life between the three operations studied. 
Normal P300 following extensive damage to the left medial temporal lobe. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during auditory and visual "oddball" tasks from a patient with a severe verbal memory deficit due to a low grade infiltrating glioma which involved the full extent of the left medial temporal lobe. In both sensory modalities, the patient's oddball-evoked P300s were symmetrical and of normal amplitude. These findings are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the hippocampus, or any other medial temporal structure, makes a substantial contribution to the scalp P300. 
Optimum dosage of 5-aminosalicylic acid as rectal enemas in patients with active ulcerative colitis. 5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), the active moiety of sulphasalazine (SASP), was given as a rectal enema to patients with mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis to determine the minimum effective dosage. A double blind study was carried out using enemas containing 1, 2, or 4 g or 5-ASA or placebo for a one month treatment period. One hundred and thirteen patients with ulcerative colitis attending our outpatient clinic volunteered to participate. Clinical, sigmoidoscopic, and histological assessments were carried out at the beginning of the study and after 15 and 30 days of treatment. All patients who received 5-ASA enemas showed significantly better results than those who received a placebo enema (p less than 0.001) but no difference was detected among the patients receiving differing concentrations of 5-ASA. This study suggests that 1 g 5-ASA (in a 100 ml enema) is a sufficient dosage for patients with a mild to moderate attack of ulcerative colitis. 
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of transthyretin devised for semimicro plasma diagnosis of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. A highly sensitive and reproducible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for human transthyretin was developed. The method is most suitable to serial monitoring of transthyretin peaks in reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for the diagnosis of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy based on isolation of variant transthyretin. This method semimicronized the original diagnostic method, requiring plasma samples of only 0.2 ml. The present enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method is also applicable to determine transthyretin in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. It correlated well when compared with a commercially available single radial immunodiffusion (r = 0.951, p less than 0.001). 
Detection of hepatitis B virus pre-S1 and pre-S2 determinants in paraffin wax embedded liver tissue: importance of reagents used. The presence of pre-S polypeptides in paraffin wax embedded liver sections from the biopsy specimens of 15 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositive patients (five with chronic persistent hepatitis (CPH), four with chronic active hepatitis (CAH), four with cirrhosis and two "healthy" HBsAg carriers) was investigated using monoclonal antibodies directed to distinct epitopes on pre-S1 (18/7 and TO 606) and pre-S2 (5535 and Q 19/10). Pre-S1 was found in 13 cases when MA 18/7 was used but in only one specimen when TO 606 was used. Pre-S2 was detected in all the biopsy specimens with 5535 and in eight samples with Q 19/10. Mild enzymatic digestion annulled the staining of all monoclonal antibodies but Q 19/10. No association was observed between pre-S polypeptide expression and hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication or disease severity. Pre-S polypeptides can be detected readily in paraffin wax embedded material but the results obtained largely depend on the monoclonal antibodies used. 
A randomized trial of ofloxacin versus cefoxitin and doxycycline in the outpatient treatment of acute salpingitis. The object of this randomized study was to compare the safety and efficacy of oral ofloxacin, 400 mg twice daily for 10 days, versus intramuscular cefoxitin, 2 gm, plus oral probenecid, 1 gm, followed by oral doxycycline, 100 mg twice daily for 10 days, in the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute salpingitis. Thirty-eight women (53%) had Neisseria gonorrhoeae from their pretreatment endocervical or endometrial cultures, and 18 had Chlamydia trachomatis (25%). Thirty-five of 37 women (95%) treated with the ofloxacin regimen were clinically cured, and 34 of 35 (97%) were cured with the cefoxitin-doxycycline regimen (p = 0.52). One clinical failure occurred in each group with N. gonorrhoeae infection, and one failure occurred in the ofloxacin group because of side effects. The bacteriologic response for N. gonorrhoeae in both groups was 100%. The eradication of C. trachomatis was 100% (10/10) for the cefoxitin/doxycycline group and 86% (6/7) for ofloxacin. The side effects were similar in both groups of subjects. In this study both regimens were effective for the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute salpingitis. 
Value of dual-energy CT in differentiating focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density masses. Focal (irregular, partial) fatty infiltration of the liver may simulate neoplastic or other hypodense masses on CT. On the basis of previous observations of the phenomenon that differences in X-ray attenuation diminish with increasing energy of X-rays used, we performed a preliminary study to determine if dual-energy CT could be used to discriminate between fatty infiltration and hypodense liver masses. Dual-energy CT at 140 and 80 kVp was performed in 14 patients undergoing liver biopsy and in seven control subjects with presumedly normal liver. Attenuation measurements were taken, and the changes in attenuation between 140 and 80 kVp were calculated. The mean changes in attenuation were 3.5 H for normal liver (n = 7), 2.5 H for hypodense liver masses (n = 6), 13 H for fatty liver (n = 5), 0.3 H for fatty liver combined with hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis (n = 3), and 2 H for the spleen (n = 18). The change in attenuation increased as the fat content in the liver increased. Analysis of variance showed a statistically significant difference (p less than .001) between fatty liver and the other groups. A difference greater than 10 H was unique to fatty infiltration. These results suggest that dual-energy CT may help to differentiate focal fatty infiltration of the liver from low-density neoplastic or other lesions, but only if the iron content of the liver is not increased. 
Nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension in diabetes mellitus. Hypertension may be partially or completely controlled by appropriate use of nondrug therapies. Because diabetic patients are so often hypertensive and because the same nondrug therapies effective for treatment of hypertension may also benefit the diabetes, the use of nondrug therapies is particularly important in these patients. Evidence about the effectiveness of various nondrug therapies is provided along with practical suggestions to improve patient adherence to them. 
Problems faced by the urban emergency department in providing rapid triage and intervention for the patient with suspected acute myocardial infarction. Widespread application of thrombolytic therapy has increased the importance of rapid triage and intervention for the patient who seeks treatment in the emergency department (ED) for suspected acute myocardial infarction. It has been suggested that all patients with acute myocardial infarction who might benefit from thrombolytic therapy should receive treatment within the first "golden hour" of arrival at the hospital ED. Busy urban medical centers, particularly public hospitals serving a large proportion of indigent patients, face special challenges in attempting to meet this goal. ED overcrowding, in part caused by patient "dumping," and diminishing governmental financial support have created an environment in which rapid triage and treatment are difficult. Because only 4% to 5% of all patients who are seen in the ED with chest pain actually require thrombolytic therapy, there is negative reinforcement for the triage nursing staff. The busy urban ED environment also creates greater litigation potential for the physician and nurse. Problems created by the busy ED environment can be minimized by providing adequate nursing staff, standing orders and protocols for evaluation of the patient with chest pain, equipment for an immediate electrocardiogram, and a thrombolytic drug stock in the ED. Hospital administrators must recognize the unique problems created in the ED when inpatient beds are unavailable. The hospital must also have efficient bed turnover and a community-wide plan for dealing with patients when the ED "closes" to incoming ambulance traffic. Governmental entities must recognize the consequences of their actions in curtailing health care benefits for those who cannot afford care in private hospitals. 
Reactivity of proximal and distal angiographically normal and stenotic coronary segments in chronic stable angina pectoris. To assess whether vasoreactivity of significant coronary stenosis (greater than 50% intraluminal diameter reduction) and that of angiographically normal coronary segments differs in proximal and distal locations, 53 patients (40 men, 13 women, mean +/- standard deviation age 55 +/- 11 years) with chronic stable angina and angiographically documented coronary artery disease were studied. While abstaining from antianginal therapy, all 53 patients underwent coronary arteriography before and after 1 mg of intracoronary isosorbide dinitrate and 21 of the 53 also before and after 20 to 30 micrograms intracoronary ergonovine. Computerized quantitative angiography was used to assess changes in the intraluminal diameter of 126 normal coronary segments (63 proximal, 63 distal) and 43 significant coronary stenoses. Nitrates dilated proximal normal coronary segments by 7.4 +/- 1.2% and distal normal coronary segments by 15 +/- 1.7% (p less than 0.01). Significant proximal coronary stenoses dilated by 11 +/- 2.5% and distal stenoses by 23 +/- 2.8% (p less than 0.01) after nitrates. Ergonovine reduced the diameter of proximal normal coronary segments by 9.3 +/- 1.7% and that of normal distal segments by 15.5 +/- 1.4% (p less than 0.01). Proximal stenoses constricted by 11 +/- 2.2% and distal stenoses by 18.4 +/- 2.8% (p = 0.06). Analysis of segments showed that nitrates dilated 19 of 63 (30%) proximal normal segments by (greater than or equal to 10%), 31 of 63 (49%) distal (p less than 0.05) and 21 of 43 (49%) stenoses. 
Subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil and herpes simplex keratitis. We present a case of herpes simplex keratitis that appeared during a period following filtering surgery in which subconjunctival 5-FU was being administered. Although the 5-FU treatment was not halted, 4 days later the keratitis healed. The typical practice of discontinuing 5-FU treatment when these kinds of inflammation occur following filtering surgery may be unwarranted. 
Murine typhus identified as a major cause of febrile illness in a camp for displaced Khmers in Thailand. Scrub and murine typhus have been identified as causes of illness among the 238,000 displaced Khmer people residing in temporary settlements on the Thai side of the Thai-Cambodian border. Still, the true extent of the problem and the relative frequency of infection with scrub typhus as compared to murine typhus are unknown. We evaluated consecutive patients with unexplained pyrexia (documented fever, no exclusionary diagnosis, and constitutional symptoms) in 1 temporary settlement over 1 month. Laboratory studies included culture of blood and assay of paired sera for rickettsial IgM and IgG antibody, for dengue IgM and IgG antibody, and for leptospiral IgM and IgG antibody. Among 37 patients (27 adults and 10 children), 28 (75%) had a rickettsiosis (26 cases of murine typhus and 2 cases of scrub typhus). No case of enteric fever, dengue, or leptospirosis was diagnosed. The illnesses of 9 patients were not identified. Signs and symptoms did not distinguish confirmed rickettsial infections from undiagnosed illnesses. The 1 month attack rate of rickettsial infection was 29/100,000 for children and 185/100,000 for adults. Murine typhus was a major cause of febrile illness in this settlement. 
The Washington University-Barnes Hospital experience with lung transplantation. Washington University Lung Transplantation Group OBJECTIVE.--To review our experience with lung transplantation, emphasizing recipient selection, choice of procedure, functional results, and outcome. DESIGN.--Retrospective review of patients who received lung transplants at Barnes Hospital, St Louis, Mo, between July 1, 1988, and January 31, 1991. SETTING.--Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Mo, and Barnes Hospital, a medical school and its affiliated referral hospital, respectively. PATIENTS.--Sixty-nine lung transplant procedures were performed in 66 recipients. Patients with clinically and physiologically severe lung disease were selected according to predetermined guidelines. Underlying diseases in the recipients included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency emphysema, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, Eisenmenger's syndrome associated with an atrial septal defect, bronchiectasis, eosinophilic granuloma, and lymphangiomyomatosis. INTERVENTION.--Double-lung, bilateral sequential, and single-lung transplantations were performed. Eight patients underwent en bloc double-lung transplantations or a modification of this procedure with separate bronchial anastomoses. Thereafter, the bilateral sequential approach to replacement of both lungs was performed in 26 patients. Thirty-two patients underwent single-lung transplantations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES.--Pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas levels, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, and actuarial survival. RESULTS.--Actuarial survival at 1 year for the 66 lung transplant recipients was 79%. Actuarial survival at 1 year was 82% for the bilateral lung transplant recipients and was 90% for the single-lung transplant recipients. In patients with either restrictive or obstructive lung disease, pulmonary function tests and arterial blood gas levels improved markedly after lung transplantation. In patients with primary pulmonary hypertension or Eisenmenger's syndrome, the pulmonary artery pressure decreased and the cardiac index increased into the normal range after single-lung transplantation. CONCLUSIONS.--In carefully selected patients with end-stage lung disease, single-lung and bilateral lung transplantations can significantly improve functional capacity, with promising early actuarial survival statistics after 1 year. 
Migraine pain associated with middle cerebral artery dilatation: reversal by sumatriptan. The combination of measurements of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and blood velocity in the middle cerebral arteries (MCA) by transcranial doppler sonography was used to investigate cerebrovascular involvement in migraine. Ten migraine patients with unilateral headache were studied during an attack and when they had been free of attacks for 5 days (non-attack). On both occasions they were given as intravenous infusion of sumatriptan (2 mg), a 5-HT1-like receptor agonist, which relieved the symptoms within 30 min without affecting rCBF. The MCA velocity was normal on both sides on the non-attack day and on the unaffected side during the attack. However, during the attack the MCA velocity on the headache side was significantly lower than that on the non-headache side (45 vs 61 cm/s:mean difference 16.3 [95% confidence interval 10.3-22.3]; p = 0.02). The MCA velocity on the headache side returned to normal after treatment with sumatriptan and recovery. Since rCBF in the MCA supply territory was unaffected, the lower velocity can be explained only by dilatation of the MCA. The mean MCA diameter increase was estimated to be 20%. Thus, headache was associated with intracranial large arterial dilatation on the headache side. Sumatriptan predominantly had effects on the distended artery, which suggests that the 5-HT receptor system has a role in the pathogenesis of migraine. 
Beta-adrenergic blocker therapy does not worsen intermittent claudication in subjects with peripheral arterial disease. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials Beta-Adrenergic blockers have been considered relatively contraindicated in peripheral arterial disease because of the perceived risk that these drugs could worsen intermittent claudication. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials from the English-language literature to determine whether or not beta-blockers exacerbate intermittent claudication. The primary focus of this analysis was the effect of beta-blockers on exercise duration, measured as walking capacity or endurance time. Outcomes were pooled where appropriate. Of 11 eligible reports, six included 11 individual controlled treatment comparisons that provided data for an analysis of pain-free exercise capacity; no effect size was statistically significant. The pooled effect size for pain-free walking distance was -0.24 (95% confidence interval, -0.62 to 0.14), indicating no significant impairment of walking capacity compared with placebo. Only one study reported that certain beta-blockers were associated with worsening of intermittent claudication. These results strongly suggest that beta-blockers do not adversely affect walking capacity or symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with mild to moderate peripheral arterial disease. In the absence of other contraindications, beta-blockers can probably be used safely in such patients. 
Exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease with and without angina. Left ventricular dysfunction during exercise is considered a relatively sensitive marker of ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction was more severe in patients with angina than in patients with ischemia without angina. Seventy-seven patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and an abnormal left ventricular response to exercise were studied by means of gated blood pool imaging. The arteriographic and functional parameters of 24 patients with angina during exercise testing imaging. The arteriographic and functional parameters of 24 patients with angina during exercise testing were compared with those of 53 patients who were pain free at the time of the test. Both groups were similar with regard to rate of multivessel disease (50% vs 51%, p = NS) and prior myocardial infarction (46% vs 51%, p = NS), as well as age, sex, and history of angina. Mean global ejection fraction remained unchanged (but abnormal) in both groups of patients during exercise. Furthermore, evidence of new regional asynergy during exercise assessed by a five-point scoring system was found to be equally abnormal in the two groups. Results of this study suggest that the severity of exercise-induced global and regional left ventricular dysfunction is independent of the presence of absence of angina during exercise testing. 
Laser balloon angioplasty: potential for reduction of the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall and for local application of bioprotective materials. Mitigation of adverse biologic reactivity after balloon angioplasty is necessary before the incidence of restenosis can be appreciably reduced. A brief review of experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall can be reduced by a suitable level of thermal denaturation or cross-linking of thrombogenic proteins. In addition, the concept of local pharmacologic therapy, which can be provided with laser balloon angioplasty at the site of arterial injury, is introduced. Preliminary in vitro and in vivo data suggest that guide catheter-injected albumin-heparin conjugates fabricated as water-insoluble microspheres remain adherent to the injured luminal surface and deeper arterial layers after physical trapping by the inflated balloon and subsequent laser/thermal exposure. The combination of initially adequate luminal morphology, reduction of the thrombogenicity of the injured arterial wall and application of local pharmacologic therapy with laser balloon angioplasty may eventually prove helpful in reducing the incidence of restenosis. 
Leber congenital amaurosis in siblings with diffuse dysmyelination. Two brothers are described with the previously unrecognized combination of Leber amaurosis and abnormal myelin detected by magnetic resonance imaging. Both have evidence of delayed psychomotor development and one has autistic features. A possible relationship with infantile autism or a peroxisomal dysfunction syndrome is explored. No peroxisomal defect was found in these patients. 
The effect of carbon dioxide laser surgery on the recurrence of keloids. The efficacy of carbon dioxide laser excision as a primary modality for the treatment of keloids was evaluated. This retrospective study focuses on 31 patients with one or more keloids, 23 of whom were available for follow-up after carbon dioxide laser excision. The patients' ages ranged from 5 to 72 years. There were 16 females and 7 males. One patient was Caucasian, 22 patients were non-Caucasian, and there were no Asians. The keloids that were excised ranged in size from 1 to 30 cm in greatest diameter. One patient had no recurrence of her keloid after carbon dioxide laser excision, 9 patients required steroids to suppress recurrences, and 13 patients were considered failures. Reasons for the failure of this modality, as well as speculation regarding the future of this procedure, are discussed. 
The comparison of 2-18F-2-deoxyglucose and 15-(ortho-123I-phenyl)-pentadecanoic acid uptake in persisting defects on thallium-201 tomography in myocardial infarction. The myocardial uptake of glucose and fatty acids into 201Tl redistribution defects were studied in 32 patients with myocardial infarction by tomography using 2-18F-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) and 15-(ortho-123I-phenyl)-pentadecanoic acid (oPPA). A total of 1153 segments were analyzed, 408 (35%) of which showed a persistent thallium-defect in stress-redistribution images. Of the segments with a decreased 201Tl uptake in these redistribution tomograms, 50.5% had a decreased uptake of both FDG and oPPA; in 21.8% FDG as well as oPPA uptake was within normal range. Normal FDG uptake but decreased oPPA uptake was detected in 17.4%, whereas 10.3% of the segments had normal oPPA uptake but decreased FDG uptake (chi-square test, p less than 0.001). A significant correlation of FDG and oPPA uptake (r = 0.51) was found in the segments with persistent 201Tl defect. Thus, a substantial fraction of persistent thallium-defects after healed myocardial infarction exhibit FDG as well as oPPA uptake, probably due to residual fatty acid metabolism in partially ischemic regions. 
Carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex in dogs with experimental heart failure. We have previously demonstrated a decrease in baroreceptor discharge sensitivity in dogs with experimental heart failure. In the present study, we determined the sensitivity of the carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex in dogs with pacing-induced heart failure. The carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex sensitivity was determined by pressurizing one carotid sinus with all other baroreceptor and cardiopulmonary receptor inputs removed. The data were analyzed by plotting carotid sinus pressure-mean arterial pressure curves and carotid sinus pressure-renal sympathetic nerve activity curves in the two groups of dogs. The peak arterial pressure during carotid hypotension was significantly depressed in dogs with heart failure compared with normal dogs (107.1 +/- 5.7 versus 139.8 +/- 7.0 mm Hg, p less than 0.001). Mean arterial pressure range, renal sympathetic nerve activity range, and peak slope were significantly decreased in the heart-failure group. To determine if this depression was completely due to depression of baroreceptor discharge per se, or to alterations in central or end-organ responsiveness, similar experiments were performed by stimulating the carotid sinus nerve and evaluating frequency, voltage, and duration of stimulation on the resultant mean arterial pressure and renal sympathetic nerve activity. As was the case with carotid sinus pressurization, electrical stimulation caused a significantly smaller change in mean arterial pressure in heart-failure dogs compared with the normal dogs. However, there was no significant difference between normal and heart-failure dogs for the renal sympathetic nerve activity-electrical stimulation curves. These data strongly suggest that the depressed carotid sinus baroreceptor reflex in heart failure is not solely the result of depressed baroreceptor responsiveness but may be related to poor end-organ responses and normal central control of renal sympathetic outflow. 
Therapeutic approach to sinusitis: antiinfectious therapy as the baseline of management. Although acute sinusitis is an infectious disease in which several bacterial species play a major etiologic role, there is an important interaction between the respiratory viruses (common cold viruses) and the bacteria in the pathogenesis of acute community-acquired sinusitis. The relative inaccessibility of the sinus cavities makes special techniques of sampling necessary to acquire specimens that accurately reflect disease conditions in the sinuses. Bacterial etiology of sinus infection has therefore been determined by sinus puncture studies, chiefly of the maxillary sinus, several of which are reviewed here. Because the bacteria causing acute sinusitis have not changed in many years, puncture is not often necessary for clinical diagnosis. Patients with acute, community-acquired sinusitis can usually be treated empirically, on the basis of previous studies, unless complications are suspected. In that case, and in other patients with hospital-acquired sinusitis, puncture of the involved sinus and aspiration of sinus fluid for Gram's staining and quantitative microbial cultures and sensitivities are required for appropriate antimicrobial management. 
Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation (CAFA) Study. The Canadian Atrial Fibrillation Anticoagulation Study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to assess the potential of warfarin to reduce systemic thromboembolism and its inherent risk of hemorrhage. As a result of the publication of two other "positive" studies of similar design and objective, this study was stopped early before completion of its planned recruitment of 630 patients. There were 187 patients randomized to warfarin and 191 to placebo. Permanent discontinuation of study medication occurred in 26% of warfarin-treated and 23% of placebo-treated patients. The target range of the international normalized ratio was 2 to 3. For the warfarin-treated patients, the international normalized ratio was in the target range 43.7% of the study days, above it 16.6% of the study days and below it 39.6% of the study days. Fatal or major bleeding occurred at annual rates of 2.5% in warfarin-treated and 0.5% in placebo-treated patients. Minor bleeding occurred in 16% of patients receiving warfarin and 9% receiving placebo. The primary outcome event cluster was nonlacunar stroke, noncentral nervous systemic embolism and fatal or intracranial hemorrhage. Events were included in the primary analysis of efficacy if they occurred within 28 days of permanent discontinuation of the study medication. The annual rates of the primary outcome event cluster were 3.5% in warfarin-treated and 5.2% in placebo-treated patients, with a relative risk reduction of 37% (95% confidence limits, -63.5%, 75.5%, p = 0.17). 
Comparative reflex response times of vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis in normal subjects and subjects with extensor mechanism dysfunction. An electromyographic study. Reflex response times of the vastus medialis obliquus and vastus lateralis were evaluated in 41 normal subjects and 16 patients with extensor mechanism dysfunction. The reflex response times for both muscles to a patellar tendon tap were evaluated by electromyography. The latencies of the muscles were statistically analyzed in both groups. In normal subjects, one-tailed paired-sample t-tests determined that the vastus medialis obliquus fired significantly faster than the vastus lateralis (P less than 0.001). In the patients, the vastus lateralis fired significantly faster than the vastus medialis obliquus (P less than 0.001). A chi square goodness of fit test demonstrated a dependency between the order of muscle firing and the type of subject (P less than 0.001). Two-tailed independent-sample t-tests revealed that the patients demonstrated a significantly faster vastus lateralis response time than the normal subjects (P less than 0.001), whereas the vastus medialis obliquus times were not significantly different. This increase in vastus lateralis reflex response time may indicate a motor control problem in the patient with extensor mechanism dysfunction. Results indicate that there is a reversal of the normal muscular firing order between the two muscles in these patients. Patients with extensor mechanism dysfunction may be demonstrating a neurophysiologic motor control imbalance that may account for or contribute to their anterior knee pain. 
Unsuspected quinine intoxication presenting as acute deafness and mutism. A case of unsuspected quinine overdose is reported in a 14-year-old girl. Presenting symptoms included deafness and mutism. Diagnosis was delayed for approximately 4 hours because of the absence of an accurate history. Case details, laboratory values, and hospital course are discussed. Signs of cinchonism and common ototoxins are discussed. Strategies for the management of quinine overdose are reviewed. 
Unilateral pulmonary oedema of the contralateral lung following transaxillary sympathectomy. A previously healthy young male developed unilateral pulmonary oedema immediately after re-expansion of an intentionally collapsed lung after transaxillary sympathectomy. The pulmonary oedema was localised to the contralateral, uncollapsed lung. 
Primary surgical treatment for carcinoma of the larynx: influence of the local invasion. In the period from 1976 to 1988, 417 patients with supraglottic carcinoma of the larynx were treated by primary surgery. Infiltration of the pre-epiglottic space was found in 11.99 per cent (50/417) of the patients. Carcinomas of the infrahyoid epiglottis spread to this space more frequently--14.24 per cent (44/309), than those of suprahyoid localization--5.55 per cent (6/108). Tumour invasion of the pre-epiglottic space is a relative contra-indication for reconstructive surgery. Partial conservation operations were performed on 32 per cent (16/50) of patients with invasion of the pre-epiglottic space. The remaining patients had a total laryngectomy. Infiltration of the paraglottic space intra-operatively was found in 2.4 per cent (10/417) of patients and all of these tumours were from the infrahyoid localization. Spread of tumours to this site is an indication for radical surgery and laryngectomy was performed on 80 per cent (8/10) of patients. 
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A new look at regression of gastrinomas. Of 44 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated at our institution, nine appeared to have undergone "regression" of their gastrinomas. Six of the nine patients had sporadic gastrinomas and became permanently eugastrinemic following excision of nodal metastases and total gastrectomy (n = 4), antrectomy (n = 1), or pancreatoduodenectomy (n = 1) (mean survival, 13 years). The other three patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome as part of the multiple endocrine adenopathy type 1 syndrome and became temporarily eugastrinemic after total gastrectomy (mean survival, 11 years). Occult submucosal duodenal-wall microgastrinomas (mean size, 3.0 mm) were found to have been serendipitously excised in four patients. Long-term follow-up of these nine patients, as well as of six other patients described in the literature, demonstrates that excision of occult duodenal-wall gastrinomas provides a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of apparent regression of primary gastrinomas and the eugastrinemia that may follow total gastrectomy. 
Spontaneous dissecting aneurysms of the basilar artery presenting with a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Report of two cases. A spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the basilar artery is a rare disorder, usually presenting with ischemia rather than a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Two cases are described of a dissecting aneurysm of the basilar artery presenting with an SAH. Vertebral angiography revealed a double lumen to the basilar artery. Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging detected the intramural hematoma. One patient was treated conservatively, and the other underwent operative intervention with wrapping of the aneurysm. The usefulness of MR imaging in the diagnosis and the treatment options are discussed. 
Reversible sustained increase of gastrin and gastric acid secretion in a subgroup of duodenal ulcer patients on long-term treatment with H2 antagonists We assessed the effect of long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion on basal and meal-stimulated serum gastrin and gastric acid secretion in 37 patients on long-term maintenance treatment with H2 antagonists for severe relapsing and/or complicated duodenal ulcer disease. After a mean of 142 weeks (range, 28-324 weeks) of continuous treatment, gastric acid secretion, basal plasma gastrin, and gastrin response to a test meal were evaluated. All tests were performed a week after drug discontinuation to exclude rapidly reversible hypergastrinemia. Gastrin levels were above the normal range in seven patients (18.9%). After H2 antagonist were stopped for 6 weeks, basal gastrin returned to normal levels in all cases [from a median of 180 (range, 130-350) pg/ml to 58 (25-90) pg/ml] and peak meal-stimulated gastrin significantly decreased from a median of 500 pg/ml to 245 pg/ml (p = 0.02). In patients with hypergastrinemia, the discontinuation of H2 antagonists for 6 weeks led to a significant decrease of gastric acid secretion. Patients who developed hypergastrinemia spent more weeks on full-dose treatment and had more recurrences during therapy. The results of the present investigation demonstrate that a long-lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion can induce, in a small percentage of patients, a reversible sustained hypergastrinemia and a consequent increase of acid secretion, which conceivably could lead to more frequent relapses of duodenal ulcer disease. 
Molecular differences between human and experimental pancreaticobiliary diversion-induced rat pancreatic neoplasia. A series of molecular changes are now known to be seen in human pancreatic neoplasia, including the very frequent mutational activation of Kirsten ras oncogene at codon 12, overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor, and abnormalities of c-erbB-2 expression. In order to determine whether similar changes can be seen in animal models of pancreatic cancer a molecular analysis of tumours induced in rats by pancreaticobiliary diversion was performed. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify portions of the rat Kirsten ras gene and sequence specific oligonucleotide hybridisation was used to define whether sequences were wild type or mutant. No evidence of mutation was found in the Kirsten ras gene at codons 12 or 61, where activating mutations are known to occur. In addition immunohistochemical methods were used to investigate expression of c-erB-2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor but no evidence of abnormal expression was found. We conclude that there are major molecular differences between human and experimental rat pancreatic cancer. 
Nd:YAG iliac and femoropopliteal laser angioplasty: results with large probes as "sole therapy". Laser assisted balloon angioplasty with a laser heated metallic capped fiberoptic catheter may be effective in the treatment of femoral and iliac artery occlusive disease. In order to avoid the inherent trauma of balloon angioplasty, yet at the same time "debulk" atheroma, 75 patients underwent laser angioplasty of the superficial femoral and iliac arteries as "sole therapy". Laser angioplasty was performed using an Nd:YAG laser coupled to a 600 micron fiber and a 3.5 mm probe (22-28 watts), 4.2 mm or 5.0 probe (32-40 watts). Fifty-nine patients had laser angioplasty for claudication and 16 for limb salvage. The initial angiographic success rate was 84% (41/49) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the superficial femoral and 69% (18/26) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the iliac arteries. In follow-up extending to 21 months (mean 14.4 months) 73% (30/41) of the superficial femoral artery and 76% (14/18) of the initially recanalized iliac arteries remain patent. When initial failures are included, this represents an overall intermediate-term patency rate of 52% (32/49) for superficial femoral and 49% (14/26) for iliac arteries respectively. By avoiding the disruptive effect on the arterial wall architecture caused by balloon angioplasty, while at the same time ablating and vaporizing more atheromatous material with larger laser probes, the long-term patency rates of laser angioplasty as "sole therapy" may prove to be superior to those of laser assisted balloon angioplasty. 
Pulmonary phaeohyphomycosis due to Xylohypha bantiana. We encountered a rare case of pulmonary phaeohyphomycosis due to Xylohypha bantiana documented by culture. This dematiaceous (darkly pigmented) fungus is primarily neurotropic. It usually produces phaeohyphomycosis of the central nervous system but may also involve the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The patient, a 49-year-old woman with a history of steroid-treated inflammatory bowel disease, was found to have a lung nodule consisting of granulomas that contained dark hyphal fragments that stained positively with the argentaffin reaction. Surgical excision was curative and appears to be the treatment of choice. 
Angiographic evolution of coronary atherosclerosis in patients receiving propranolol. A two-year follow-up STUDY OBJECTIVE: To test whether propranolol may influence the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. DESIGN: Repeat coronary angiography after two year treatment and evaluation of changes in coronary narrowings. SETTING: Subjects with effort angina of recent onset requiring coronary angiography and medical treatment. PATIENTS: 80 untreated patients, with a greater than or equal to 50 percent focal narrowing on a major coronary branch associated or not with a less than 50 percent stenosis of other major branches. They were randomized to isosorbide dinitrate (40 mg bid) (group 1, control group) or to propranolol (80 mg qid) (group 2, treatment group). RESULTS: At restudy, there were more diseased vessels and These narrowings per patient in both groups. Multivessel involvement and greater than or equal to 50 percent obstructions were also augmented. These changes were not statistically significant. Patients with progression of the stenotic tracts (both greater than or equal to 50 percent and less than 50 percent were 19 (48 percent) in group 1 and 28 (70 percent) in group 2 (p less than 0.05). Narrowings with progression were 25 in group 1 and 48 in group 2. Thirteen narrowings in group 1 and 15 in group 2 were newly detected at restudy. Eighteen patients (45 percent) in group 1 and nine (23 percent) in group 2 had a steady disease. Smoking, high blood pressure, family history of coronary disease, blood glucose values and lipid levels were considered; the only significant group differences were 31 percent rise of total triglyceride and 23 percent decrease of HDL cholesterol in patients who were treated with propranolol. CONCLUSIONS: Propranolol showed an adverse influence on coronary atherosclerosis, regarding the evolution of both greater than or equal to 50 percent and less than 50 percent narrowings and not the formation of new stenoses. Changes in serum lipid values might have a role. 
Comparison of duplex ultrasonography and venography in the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. Sixty-five patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis (DVT) in 68 limbs were entered consecutively into a study to compare venography with duplex ultrasonography scanning. Both tests were performed on 64 limbs, venography being contraindicated in four. Overall, duplex scanning correctly identified 86 per cent of DVTs diagnosed on venography and correctly excluded 80 per cent with negative venograms. Nearly all errors arose in the diagnosis of calf DVT. In the femoral vein duplex scanning had a specificity of 100 per cent and a sensitivity of 95 per cent. In addition, duplex scanning provided data on the limb not undergoing venography. Of 55 limbs that underwent bilateral duplex scanning, five had thrombus in the femoropopliteal segment and a negative contralateral venogram. In addition, three Baker's cysts were diagnosed. Duplex scanning can be used in patients in whom venography is contraindicated and may also provide information about the contralateral limb. We regard femoropopliteal duplex scanning as sufficiently accurate that treatment can be initiated on the basis of the scan. Duplex scanning should replace venography as the standard method of diagnosing femoropopliteal DVT; radiographic studies should now be required only when the scan result is in doubt. 
Use of amiodarone for short-term and adjuvant therapy in young patients. Limited data are available defining the safety of amiodarone for short-term use or as part of combination antiarrhythmic therapy in pediatric patients. Results of amiodarone in 47 young patients for an average treatment duration of 12 months were examined. There were 21 male and 26 female patients (age range of 23 weeks gestation to 29 years). Patients were divided into 4 groups: group 1--electrocardiographic documented ventricular tachycardia (n = 7); group 2--syncope of unknown cause (n = 16); group 3--primary atrial tachycardia (n = 11); and group 4--supraventricular tachycardia (n = 13). Amiodarone was clinically useful in 32 (68%) patients. Amiodarone was considered effective as a sole antiarrhythmic agent in 21 (45%) patients. Treatment was ineffective but was continued in 11 (23%) patients; in 10 of these 11 patients amiodarone was adjuvant to other antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone was considered ineffective and was withdrawn in 15 (32%) patients. No patient required cardiac pacemaker implant during therapy. Torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest occurred in 1 patient each after 9 and 14 days of therapy, respectively. Two patients underwent successful cardiac transplant after 2 and 14 months of amiodarone administration, respectively. Amiodarone was used as short-term treatment (less than 18 months) in 7 infants (age less than 18 months), and after cessation of treatment there was no recurrence of tachycardia for 4 to 24 months. Results of this study confirm reports of successful amiodarone use in pediatric patients with a variety of rhythm disturbances. 
Gastrointestinal malignancy in patients with AIDS. To clarify the prevalence and characteristics of gastrointestinal malignancy in patients with AIDS, we reviewed the demographics and clinical features of patients with AIDS and gastrointestinal neoplasms seen at North Central Bronx Hospital and Montefiore Medical Center during the past 8 yr. Malignant neoplasia complicated AIDS in 108/869 (12%) of the cases in our study. Most common was Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) (60%), followed by lymphoma (35%) and miscellaneous tumors (6.5%). The gastrointestinal tract was involved in 35/108 (32%) of patients with AIDS and neoplasia. Gastrointestinal tract involvement with KS usually was silent, although present, in every patient with KS who underwent autopsy. Lymphoma was most commonly non-Hodgkin's, and often produced symptoms. Uncommonly, the gastrointestinal tract was the primary site of neoplasms other than KS or lymphoma. 
Frontal lobe degeneration: clinical, neuropsychological, and SPECT characteristics. The clinical, neuropsychological, and cerebral blood flow characteristics of eight patients with frontal lobe degeneration (FLD) were studied. Social withdrawal and behavioral disinhibition were the earliest and most common clinical presentations, and psychiatric symptoms typically preceded the onset of dementia by several years. Neuropsychological testing showed selective impairment of frontal and memory tasks with relative sparing of attention, language, and visuospatial skills. Single-photon emission computerized tomography demonstrated frontal and temporal hypoperfusion with relative sparing of parietal and occipital blood flow. Previous studies suggest that the neuropathologic findings in patients with FLD are varied; some demonstrate frontal gliosis, neuronal loss, and Pick bodies while others show only gliosis and neuronal loss. 
Physician practices in the prevention of venous thromboembolism. OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of use of prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism in high-risk hospital patients. DESIGN: A retrospective medical record review. SETTING: A community-wide study in 16 short-stay hospitals in central Massachusetts. PATIENTS: A total of 2017 patients with multiple risk factors for venous thromboembolism. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: On the basis of age, length of hospitalization, and the presence of at least one additional major risk factor, 17% of 151,349 discharges (25,410 patients) were identified as being at high risk for venous thromboembolism. Eight percent of these discharges were randomly selected for medical record review. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism was received by 32% of these high-risk patients. Prophylaxis use among the 16 study hospitals varied widely, ranging from 9% to 56%, and was higher in teaching hospitals than in nonteaching hospitals (44% compared with 19%; P less than 0.001). One or more of the following methods of prophylaxis was used: low-dose heparin (78%), intermittent calf compression (13%), warfarin (12%), and inferior vena caval filter (3%). Use of prophylaxis increased with the number of risk factors identified (P less than 0.001). CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis for venous thromboemobolism is underused, particularly in nonteaching hospitals. 
Epidemiology of inflammatory bowel disease among U.S. military veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs maintains a computerized patient treatment file that contains all records from veterans treated as inpatients in VA hospitals distributed throughout the United States. Using the patient treatment files from 1986 to 1989, the present study takes advantage of this large national data set to examine demographic and geographic associations of inflammatory bowel disease. Inflammatory bowel disease tended to affect predominantly female, white, and younger veterans, these trends being more marked in cases of Crohn's disease than ulcerative colitis. Hospital discharges secondary to both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis appeared to be more frequent in veterans from northern than southern parts of the United States, but did not show a seasonal variation different from the general pattern of all other diagnoses. The results in veterans confirm observations made in other studies and suggest that inflammatory bowel disease among different populations is modulated by similar pathophysiologic mechanisms and environmental risk factors. 
Barrett's esophagus. A continuing conundrum. Barrett's esophagus, a condition in which the distal esophagus is lined by columnar epithelium, is almost always caused by gastroesophageal reflux and often occurs in conjunction with a sliding hiatal hernia. Patients are typically white men in their 50s who smoke and drink, and they present with complaints of regurgitation, heartburn, and/or dysphagia. Endoscopic biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Complications, such as stricture, ulcer, dysplasia, and malignant degeneration, occur in many cases. Adenocarcinoma is the most serious complication. Medical treatment, including life-style changes as well as pharmacologic therapy, usually relieves symptoms and heals esophagitis, but when it fails, antireflux surgery is indicated. Patients without evidence of dysplasia should undergo endoscopy yearly; those with mild dysplasia require more frequent surveillance. If biopsies disclose severe dysplasia, esophagogastrectomy should be performed. 
Reading problems in adult chronic headache sufferers. In a questionnaire survey we determined the prevalence of problems with reading, at present as well as in the past, in adult chronic headache sufferers as compared with age- and sex-matched controls. The reading problems inquired about were those with reading in general, reading quickly, prolonged reading and reading comprehension. The subjects were also asked about present and past problems with writing, concentrating, performing mathematics and overall learning. Significant differences in the prevalences of the problems studied between the headache sufferers and controls were observed on just two items and only for the female groups. These items were present problems with reading comprehension (39.3% versus 7.5%; p = 0.002) and concentrating (46.4% versus 17.5%; p = 0.015). We concluded that adult female headache sufferers have impaired reading comprehension and concentration abilities which do not seem to originate from the past. 
Structure-function relationships of the mouse inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. The homotetrameric complex of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) receptors displays a Ca2+ release activity in response to InsP3 molecules. Structure-function relationships of the mouse cerebellar InsP3 receptor have been studied by analyses of a series of internal deletion or C-terminal truncation mutant proteins expressed in NG108-15 cells. Within the large cytoplasmic portion of the InsP3 receptor, approximately 650 N-terminal amino acids are highly conserved between mouse and Drosophila, and this region has the critical sequences for InsP3 binding that probably form the three-dimensionally restricted binding site. The N-terminal region of each InsP3 receptor subunit also binds one InsP3 molecule. Cross-linking experiments have revealed that InsP3 receptors are intermolecularly associated at the transmembrane domains and/or the successive C termini. The interaction between the receptor subunit and InsP3 may cause a conformational change in the tetrameric complex, resulting in the opening of Ca2+ channels. 
Treatment of pathologic fracture of the humerus. Twenty-one patients with 22 pathologic humeral fractures were seen between January 1977 and November 1988. All fractures were secondary to myeloma or metastatic disease. Primary bone tumors were not included. Nineteen of 22 fractures were treated with intramedullary fixation: 12 of these fractures were also treated with methylmethacrylate. Two patients had compression plating, and the remaining patient had no surgery. Twenty-eight percent had a previously undiagnosed malignancy. Postoperatively, 78% of the patients had only mild or moderate pain. Five patients had progression of local disease postoperatively, two resulting in failure of fixation. Both plates failed. Three patients required additional humeral procedures, one of which was a shoulder disarticulation for pain. Intramedullary fixation of pathologic fractures improves the quality of life by controlling pain for most patients. Complications, treatment failures, and pain are related to a 29% rate of tumor progression and a 23% rate of fixation failure. 
Preeclampsia, trisomy 13, and the placental bed. Genetic predisposition and abnormal trophoblastic function are thought to contribute to the development of preeclampsia. A multipara developed severe preeclampsia and subsequently delivered a live growth-retarded infant with trisomy 13. Biopsy of the placental bed taken immediately after delivery demonstrated inadequate trophoblastic remodeling of the maternal uterine vasculature, with an absence of normal physiologic changes in the spiral arteries. This case suggests that fetal trisomy 13 can be associated with preeclampsia in multiparous women and that abnormal trophoblastic invasion may contribute to the pathophysiology. 
A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to assess the side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate in hormone replacement therapy. Cyclic progestin therapy has been widely advocated as an adjunct to postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy to reduce the risk of endometrial carcinoma. Acceptance of this approach, however, appears to have preceded detailed evaluation of possible adverse side effects of progestins that could result in patient noncompliance. We evaluated the nonmenstrual physical and psychological side effects of oral medroxyprogesterone acetate given in conjunction with transdermal estrogen in two groups of women with previous hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Twenty-four women with prospectively documented severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) before surgery and 24 women with no such history of adverse premenstrual changes received transdermal estrogen 100 micrograms on days 1-25 and either oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily or an identical placebo (days 12-25) in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Mood and physical symptoms were monitored prospectively, using daily self-ratings on the Daily Symptoms Checklist. The Beck Depression Inventory and Premenstrual Tension Self-Rating Scale were completed on day 24. At the study's completion, the patients were asked which treatment period they preferred. Paired comparisons did not reveal any significant differences, and preference for treatment was equally divided between medroxyprogesterone acetate and placebo. We conclude that addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 14 days to cyclic transdermal estrogen therapy (days 1-25) produces no consistent adverse physical or psychological effects on women for one cycle of treatment, regardless of their PMS history. 
A randomized trial comparing radiation therapy versus concomitant radiation therapy and chemotherapy in carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus. From September 1982 to December 1985, 59 previously untreated patients with Stage II squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus were randomly assigned to receive radiation therapy (RT) alone versus the concomitant use of RT and chemotherapy (CT) with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), mitomycin C, and bleomycin (RT + CT). Thirty-one patients were randomized to the RT regimen and 28 to the RT + CT regimen. The complete local response rate was 58% for the RT group and 75% for the RT + CT group (P = 0.77). The median duration of response was 8 months for both groups. The overall 5-year survival rates were 6% and 16% (P = 0.16) for the RT and RT + CT groups, respectively. Acute toxicities were more pronounced in the RT + CT group. This clinical trial did not detect a difference in outcome with combined-technique therapy. This result must be interpreted with caution because of the small number of patients entered in this trial. Confirmation of the value or lack of value for combined therapy will require additional larger clinical trials. 
Characterization of in vitro chemosensitivity of perioperative human ovarian malignancies by adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay. We report the in vitro chemosensitivity of primary and recurrent human ovarian tumor samples analyzed by adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay. We defined sensitivity as a greater than or equal to 70% decrease in intracellular adenosine triphosphate versus control at 20% of the reported peak plasma concentration per agent tested. Twenty of 21 assays (95.24%) were completed successfully. Single-agent and combined dose-response patterns consisting of decreasing viability with increasing drug concentration were observed consistently. Thirteen primary tumors were assayed, with 15.4% sensitive to cisplatin, 7.7% sensitive to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and 53.8% sensitive to their combination. Seven recurrent tumors were assayed, with 14.3% sensitive to cisplatin, 28.6% sensitive to 5-fluorouracil, and 42.9% sensitive to their combination. Dose-response characteristics and in vitro sensitivity rates reported in this article are consistent with reports of patient response in the literature. We conclude that adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay is an efficient and reliable instrument for the in vitro chemosensitivity assessment of human tumors and warrants further clinical investigation. 
The abdomen, thigh, and arm as sites for subcutaneous sodium heparin injections. The purpose of this study was to evaluate three subcutaneous injection sites for low-dose heparin therapy (5,000 units). One hundred and one subjects were randomly placed in one of three groups. Group A received injections in the abdomen, Group B, in the thigh, and Group C in the arm. Each subject received three injections at the one site. Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was measured prior to initiation of heparin and again four hours after the first injection. Bruising was measured at 48, 60, and 72 hours postinjection. There were no statistically significant differences among groups for either changes in APTT or bruising at 60 and 72 hours postinjection. Thus the clinical practice of utilizing the abdomen as the only or preferred site for subcutaneous heparin injections was not supported. 
Open surgery assisted by the neuronavigator, a stereotactic, articulated, sensitive arm. A new computed tomographic-stereotactic device that translates the operating point onto preoperative computed tomographic (CT) images, the Neuronavigator, has been developed. We have applied this system to various neurosurgical procedures to examine its usefulness. The system consists of a 6-joint sensing arm and a 16-bit personal computer. It projects the location of the arm tip onto a corresponding CT slice with a cursor that guides the surgeon toward the intracranial target during open surgery. The system also projects the location of the tip onto angiograms, and when used in conjunction with echography or a transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow meter, the surgeon's ability to navigate is enhanced. Sixty-eight patients underwent operation with the Neuronavigator. The navigation system worked as the core of a multimodal three-dimensional data base that proved to be useful during surgery. The maximum detection error was 2.5 mm, which was considered sufficient for open microsurgery. It also proved useful in designing the position of a craniotomy, in targeting deep-seated mass lesions, and in tracing the tumor edge, which had been identified on a CT scan. When the angiogram was combined with the navigator, it became easy to identify key vessels within a small operating field. The system was also combined with a TCD flow meter. This combination makes it possible to translate the measuring point of the TCD directly into CT coordinates, improving the precision of location of the TCD probe. The Neuronavigator combines various diagnostic images into one database and effectively guides the surgeon during surgery. 
Can anxiety help us tolerate pain? It was hypothesized that anxiety which is relevant to the source of pain exacerbates pain, whereas anxiety which is irrelevant to the source of pain reduces the experience of pain. Female subjects were given either high or low anxiety provoking information about a cold pressor task (relevant anxiety) or high or low anxiety provoking information about a potential shock (irrelevant anxiety). Subjects were then exposed to the cold pressor. The results demonstrated that subjects who were highly anxious about the cold pressor reported experiencing the most pain. Subjects who were highly anxious about the shock reported the least pain and reported significantly less pain than subjects who were highly anxious about the cold pressor. These findings clearly demonstrate that the relationship between anxiety and pain is not always positive or unidirectional. 
Von Hippel-Lindau disease and erythrocytosis: radioimmunoassay of erythropoietin in cyst fluid from a brainstem hemangioblastoma. A 59-year-old woman with von Hippel-Lindau disease developed erythrocytosis and a recurrent intracranial hemangioblastoma. Radioimmunoassay showed an elevated level of erythropoietin in her serum. Cyst fluid from the tumor also contained erythropoietin, concentrated a thousandfold relative to the serum level. Production of erythropoietin by hemangioblastomas may explain the erythrocytosis present in some patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. 
One hundred ten consecutive primary orthotopic liver transplants under FK 506 in adults. An account is given of the 6- to 12-month survival, and causes of failure in 110 consecutive patients who underwent primary liver transplantation under treatment from the outset with FK 506 and steroids. The patient survival is 92.7%, and the first graft survival is 87.3%. At a very high frequency, the patients achieved good graft function, and they had a relatively low morbidity that was partially ascribable to minimal use and early discontinuance (in 60% of cases) of steroids. Renal dysfunction and other adverse findings were largely confined to patients with poor initial graft function and consequent apparent alteration of the kinetics of FK 506 elimination, causing functional overdosage. Results compare very favorably with our past record using conventional immunosuppression, and support the belief that FK 506 is a superior immunosuppressive agent which is suitable for chronic administration. 
Alcohol consumption of patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias other than atrial fibrillation. We studied the recent alcohol consumption and other possible precipitating factors in 99 consecutive patients (53 men and 46 women) all under 65 years of age with sustained re-entry and automatic supraventricular tachyarrhythmias and compared them with those of two groups of controls. One control group was derived from the Emergency Room patients and matched for age and sex; the other group (44 men, 22 women, mean age 48.7 years) was randomly selected from the general out-of-hospital population. There were 50 patients with supraventricular tachycardia, 30 with atrial flutter, and 19 with paroxysmal atrial tachycardia. Coronary heart disease (14% of patients), hypertension (10%), and dilated cardiomyopathy (6%) were the most prevalent cardiovascular diseases associated with the arrhythmias. The self-reported alcohol consumption of patients with arrhythmias during the week preceding the arrhythmia did not differ significantly from that of hospital or population controls, although significantly more patients than controls had liver enzyme levels above normal; neither were there any significant differences between the groups regarding prevalence for alcoholism as judged by the CAGE questionnaire. The results were essentially similar when patients with supraventricular tachycardia and those with intra-atrial tachyarrhythmias (flutter and paroxysmal tachycardia) were separately compared with the controls. We conclude that alcohol consumption, although a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, is not associated with the induction of other supraventricular tachyarrhythmias in patients of working age. 
Intensive combination chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation leads to the reappearance of Philadelphia chromosome-negative cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Fifteen patients with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) who were ineligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or alpha-interferon therapy were included in this study. Eight patients were in the first late chronic phase, five were in the second chronic phase, one was in the accelerated phase, and one was in the blastic phase. Autologous bone marrow cells (median, 2.5 x 10(8) nucleated cells/kg) were stored at a median of 30 months after diagnosis. Patients were treated with cyclophosphamide (1.5 g/m2 daily for 4 days), carmustine (BCNU) (300 mg/m2), and etoposide (VP-16) (250 mg/m2 daily for 3 days) (CBV), followed by reinfusion of autologous bone marrow. Hematopoietic recovery was rapid, and toxicity was mild to moderate in 14 patients. One patient died of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis. Eight of 15 patients showed Ph suppression to less than 90% Ph-positive metaphases after autologous BMT. Major cytogenetic responses (Ph suppression to less than 35% Ph-positive metaphases) developed in four patients. Cytogenetic responses were observed in 4 of 11 patients infused with 100% Ph-positive marrows, and in all 4 patients infused with Ph-mosaic marrows (mixture of diploid and Ph-positive cells). Better results were observed when autologous BMT was performed in the chronic phase compared with the advanced phases. The major cytogenetic responses have lasted for 3, 4, 12, and 15+ months, whereas minor cytogenetic responses lasted for only a short time (less than 2 months). Three of seven patients (43%) in the chronic phase with previous resistance to alpha-interferon therapy became sensitive to alpha-interferon therapy after autologous BMT. The authors concluded that intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT produced cytogenetic remissions in patients with Ph-positive CML and reinduced disease sensitivity to alpha-interferon therapy in patients previously resistant to it. This is particularly useful when treatment is given during the chronic phase and stem cells are collected at a time of previous cytogenetic remission. 
Progressive myoclonic ataxia (the Ramsay Hunt syndrome). It has been suggested from studies of patients with progressive myoclonus epilepsy that the term Ramsay Hunt syndrome should be abandoned, as its use has led to nosologic confusion, and because, in the light of modern diagnostic techniques, the majority of cases can be allocated to specific disease categories, chiefly, Unverricht-Lundborg disease (Baltic myoclonus) and mitochondrial encephalomyopathy. Review of 30 cases of this syndrome, defined as progressive ataxia and myoclonus and infrequent seizures in the absence of dementia, showed that a clinical or biochemically supported diagnosis could not be made in 43%. This low diagnostic yield probably reflects differences in ascertainment of patients; those described here were referred with a syndrome of progressive myoclonic ataxia (the Ramsay Hunt syndrome) rather than progressive myoclonus epilepsy. These two syndromes share common causes, but a smaller proportion of patients with progressive myoclonic ataxia can currently be diagnosed precisely during life. 
Tetanic response of the cricothyroid muscle. Tetanic response of canine cricothyroid muscle tissue was investigated through a series of experiments conducted in vitro. Two separate portions of the cricothyroid muscle, namely the pars recta and pars oblique, were studied. Samples of the muscle were dissected from dog larynges excised a few minutes before death and kept in Krebs-Ringer solution at a temperature of 37 degrees +/- 1 degrees C and a pH of 7.4 +/- 0.05. Tetanic contraction of the muscle samples was obtained by field stimulation to the muscle through a pair of parallel-plate platinum electrodes and with a train of square pulses of 0.1-millisecond duration and 85-V amplitude. Isometric force responses of the pars recta and pars oblique muscles were obtained electronically with a dual servo system (ergometer). The effect of tissue elongation on the active and passive responses was quantified by stimulation of the sample during cyclic elongation. Both active and passive responses as a function of elongation were obtained on the same sample. 
Clinical symptoms in young adults with atypical chest pain attending the emergency department. Clinical symptoms were studied in 69 consecutive patients below the age of 40 years who were attending the emergency unit because of unexplained chest pain. In a structured interview a few weeks after the emergency visit, only one-third of the patients reported that they believed in the doctor's diagnosis; they believed in a psychological or cardiac origin of the pain more often than the doctors. The chest pain was most often described as oppressive and/or stabbing. In 95% of cases it was central or left-sided. Associated symptoms were commonly reported, breathlessness being most commonly reported by two-thirds of the patients, followed by dizziness, palpitation and numbness/tingling. Mental symptoms such as tiredness, anxiety and tension were frequently reported. On the basis of the background literature the aetiology is discussed. We conclude that immediate symptom analysis, including psychosomatic symptoms, particularly breathing problems, is of central importance. 
Failure of infection control in intensive care units: can sucralfate improve the situation? Conventional infection control measures in intensive care units (ICUs) are aimed primarily at stemming cross-infections. The role of patients' endogenous flora in the pathogenesis of nosocomial infection and occasional lapses in aseptic technique in ICUs help to explain the frequent failure of the conventional approaches. Newer control strategies include avoiding gastric and oropharyngeal overgrowth of gram-negative bacilli by using sucralfate to avoid gastric alkalinization and/or suppressing nosocomial flora by use of topical antimicrobials. 
Shower versus sink bath: evaluation of heart rate, blood pressure, and subjective response of the patient with myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of a sitting shower versus a sitting sink bath in low-risk patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Heart rate, blood pressure (mean blood pressure and rate-pressure-product), ratings of perceived exertion, and occurrence of symptoms during the baths and between resting, bathing, and recovery periods were evaluated. Thirty patients with MI were tested during their first and second self-bath on 2 consecutive days between 2 and 9 days after MI. The bathing methods produced significant increases from the resting values in all the variables (p less than or equal to 0.05). No significant differences between the resting and recovery values existed (p greater than 0.05). Ten subjects experienced atypical responses to bathing as indicated by heart rate and blood pressures. Fatigue was the most frequently encountered symptom at rest and during the bathing activities. The findings suggest that low-risk patients with MI can choose between a sitting sink bath or a sitting shower as their first self-bath after MI, based on preferences. However, because the bathing activity (and not the bathing method) did produce some atypical responses in one third of the subjects, readiness to engage in bathing activities should be individually assessed by objective and subjective criteria. 
Functional myocardial impairment in children treated with anthracyclines for cancer. A non-invasive exercise method was used to look for myocardial damage in apparently normal children who had received moderate doses of anthracyclines for treatment of cancer. 19 children (mean [SD] age 10.6 [4.3] years) who had received anthracyclines (mean total dose 230 [119] mg/m2) and 10 who had received other cytotoxic drugs (mean age 13.3 [4.9] years) were selected from 263 children attending routine follow-up examinations. They underwent measurement of heart rate, blood pressure, and left ventricular dimensions by echocardiography before and after exercise on a bicycle for a maximum of 10 min. All 29 were in remission. All the subjects showed normal fractional shortening (FS = left ventricular end-diastolic minus end-systolic diameter as a percentage of the end-diastolic diameter) at rest, but the increase in FS on exercise was significantly lower in the children who had received anthracyclines than in those who had not (3 [16]% vs 23 [17]%; p less than 0.05). This difference remained significant after adjustment for age and drug exposure. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the adjusted mean percentage changes on exercise in heart rate or systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Disease type had no effect on the cardiological indices. Thus, many children who have received anthracyclines may have suffered subclinical myocardial damage. Post-exercise echocardiography seems a useful non-invasive method for detecting such damage. Long-term cardiological follow-up of these patients is needed. 
Intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm presenting as recurrent epistaxis. Massive epistaxis from a leaking intracavernous carotid artery aneurysm is a rare occurrence. Such an unusual case is presented with appropriate imaging and a successful treatment program. 
Pharmacology of the nitrovasodilators. Antianginal, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet actions. The nitrovasodilators, nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside, cause both arterial and venous smooth muscle dilation by the intracellular release of nitric oxide. Nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an accumulation of cyclic GMP. The endogenous formation of nitric oxide results in vasodilatory activity similar to the nitrovasodilators. Nitroglycerin is commonly used in the treatment of angina pectoris because of its ability to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption. Most likely, this response occurs as a result of a reduction in preload, which can decrease arterial wall tension and improve coronary blood flow. This pharmacologic effect warrants the use of nitroglycerin in the treatment of myocardial ischemia or infarction, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. Sodium nitroprusside is effective in reducing arterial blood pressure in hypertensive crisis as a result of systemic vasodilation leading to a reduction in preload and afterload. Sodium nitroprusside is not as effective in the treatment of angina pectoris or in diminishing of myocardial ischemia because it does not preferentially improve blood flow to ischemic myocardium over nonischemic myocardium. Inhibition of platelet aggregation has been demonstrated with these drugs, but the clinical applications need further investigation. Nursing interventions for the patient on nitrovasodilator therapy include careful hemodynamic monitoring and drug infusion, along with elimination of physical and emotional stimuli that can aggravate the patient's underlying pathology. 
Sudden death due to disease flare with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for carcinoma of the prostate. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for prostate cancer is a new method of management for metastatic disease. During the initial 1 to 2-week period of administration an increase in serum testosterone concentration can lead to an exacerbation of clinical symptoms (flare phenomenon). Two patients are summarized who received luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy without flare blockade and died suddenly during month 1 of therapy. A review of 765 patients in 9 series found 10.9% who suffered disease flare and 15 who died during disease flare. Of these 17 patients 12 were similar to our 2. These data suggest that any patient placed on luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist therapy for prostate cancer merits some form of flare blockade during the initial 1 or 2 months of therapy. 
Acute central nervous system complications after pulse steroid therapy in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. We describe 2 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who developed an acute psychosis and a cerebrovascular accident after pulse methylprednisolone therapy. A literature review revealed 8 additional patients with SLE with acute central nervous system complications after pulse therapy. 
Vascular complications of cardiac catheterization. Femoral artery injury after diagnostic and therapeutic cardiac catheterization is a frequently encountered clinical problem. This study reviews 150 femoral artery injuries that occurred in 16,350 patients over a 5-year period. A prospective computerized cardiac catheterization data bank was used to determine significant risk factors associated with the occurrence of vascular injury. Logistic regression analysis revealed that congestive heart failure, female gender, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or valvuloplasty procedure were significantly associated with occurrence of vascular injury. Greater age, smaller body surface area, and smaller weight were also associated with injury. Recommendations for management include an aggressive approach to obstruction even if local vascular reconstruction is required. False aneurysms are studied by ultrasonography, and small ones may be observed expectantly. Larger aneurysms and aneurysms that persist beyond a few days are managed by use of general or regional anesthesia and by gaining proximal control of the iliac artery. Arteriovenous fistulas resulting from catheterization are rarely hemodynamically significant and often close spontaneously. Thus repair should be delayed. 
Malignant astrocytomas: focal tumor recurrence after focal external beam radiation therapy. Hochberg and Pruitt have reported glioblastomas recurring within 2 cm of the primary site in 90% of patients after whole-brain radiation therapy. They suggested that computerized tomography (CT) scan accuracy would permit smaller radiation fields. A treatment protocol with smaller-field focal brain irradiation following surgical resection is reported. The first 4500 cGy of radiation is focused to within a 3-cm margin around the tumor, with a 1500-cGy boost within a 1.5-cm margin. Forty-two patients with grade III or IV astrocytoma, treated with focal brain radiation therapy were reviewed retrospectively to assess patterns of tumor recurrence. Thirty patients received intra-arterial bromodeoxyuridine (BUdR) radiosensitization with focal brain radiation therapy, and 12 patients underwent conventional focal brain radiation therapy. Tumor margin was defined on preoperative and recurrence CT scans as the contrast-enhanced area; these were traced on acetate templates and compared with each other and with the actual scans. In all 42 patients, the lesion recurred within a 2-cm margin of the original tumor. Four patients had two recurrent areas: the second area was within the 2-cm margin in two, and outside this margin in two. These results are similar to those of Hochberg and Pruitt. It is suggested that focal irradiation is now the optimal treatment for malignant astrocytoma. Since recurrences continue to be within the irradiated volumes, it appears that higher focal doses of radiation are appropriate for clinical treatment trials of malignant astrocytomas. 
Abnormal vitamin B12 metabolism in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Association with neurological dysfunction. An increased prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency has been reported in patients infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We report an unexpectedly high prevalence (20%) of such abnormal vitamin B12 metabolism in a population of HIV-infected patients referred for neurological evaluation. This abnormality was associated with both peripheral neuropathy and myelopathy. A majority of those treated with cyanocobalamin had a therapeutic response. Selected neuropathological results suggest a relationship between vitamin B12 deficiency and vacuolar myelopathy. Vitamin B12 deficiency may be a frequent and treatable cause of neurological dysfunction in patients with HIV infection. 
Photodynamic killing of human squamous cell carcinoma cells using a monoclonal antibody-photosensitizer conjugate. We have developed procedures in which the photosensitizer benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPD) can be covalently linked to carrier molecules of modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to produce water-soluble PVA-BPD conjugates with a molecular mass in the range of 30 kd. These carriers can subsequently be covalently linked to monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) using heterobifunctional linking agents. We describe here such a conjugate in which the MoAb (5E8) has specificity for a glycoprotein detected on human squamous cell carcinomas of the lung. We provide evidence that the conjugates produced were covalently linked and retained both their photosensitizing and antigen-binding activities. We show further that the MoAb-PVA-BPD conjugate, in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, exhibited highly enhanced phototoxic killing of the target cell line (A549) over that exhibited by free BPD or a control MoAb-PVA-BPD conjugate. These results demonstrate, therefore, both the selectivity and specificity of this MoAb conjugate. 
An in vivo model of experimental arterial stenosis, intimal damage, and periodic thrombosis. Coronary artery bypass grafts, angioplasty, and thrombolysis are beneficial procedures for patients with coronary artery disease. However, these procedures can fail by mechanisms related to interactions between platelets and the damaged arterial wall. An experimental model for studying some of the mechanisms of platelet interaction with endothelial- and medial-damaged stenosed arteries is described. Dogs or pigs are anesthetized, and the chest opened. The heart is exposed, the circumflex or left anterior descending coronary artery is dissected out, and an EMF or Doppler flow probe is placed on it. Distal to the flow probe, the artery is clamped with a vascular clamp to produce endothelial and/or medial injury. Then, an encircling plastic cylinder is placed around the outside of the injured artery, producing a "critical stenosis." Acute platelet thrombus formation begins to occur in the stenosed lumen, gradually increasing the amount of stenosis. This causes the coronary flow to decline and reach zero flow when the artery is completely occluded. Then, the thrombus is embolized into the distal circulation, and flow is restored to normal levels. This occurs repeatedly causing cyclic flow reductions (CFRs). These CFRs can be made larger and to occur more frequently by increasing in vivo platelet activity, by raising the plasma catecholamine levels, or by increasing the collagen exposed in the stenosed lumen by increased medial damage. If an effective dose of an antiplatelet agent is given, the CFRs will be decreased in size and frequency or abolished entirely. Aspirin and other agents abolish the CFRs in this model; however, CFRs can be renewed by infusions of catecholamines or platelet activating factor. Thus, the model may be useful for studying mechanisms that enhance or inhibit arterial thrombosis in stenosed arteries with endothelial and medial injury. 
Growth hormone treatment of growth failure secondary to total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation. Growth hormone was given to 13 children (nine boys, four girls) with acute leukaemia who had undergone treatment with cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation before bone marrow transplantation. Mean age at total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation was 9.0 years (range 3.7-15.8). Endocrinological investigation was carried out at a mean of 2.0 years (range 0.4-4.0) after bone marrow transplantation. Peak serum growth hormone responses to hypoglycaemia were less than 10.0 micrograms/l (less than 20.0 mU/l) in 10, 10.5 micrograms/l (21.0 mU/l) in one, greater than 16.0 micrograms/l (greater than 32.0 mU/l) in two patients. Mean age of the patients at the start of growth hormone treatment was 12.2 years (range 5.8-18.2). The mean time between total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation and the start of growth hormone treatment was 3.2 years (range, 1.1-5.0). Height velocity SD score (SD) increased from a mean pretreatment value of -1.27 (0.65) to + 0.22 (0.81) in the first year, +0.16 (1.11) in the second year, and +0.42 (0.71) in the third year of treatment. Height SD score (SD) changed only slightly from -1.52 (0.42) to -1.50 (0.47) in the first year, to -1.50 (0.46) in the second year, and -1.74 (0.92) in the third year. Measurement of segmental proportions showed no significant increase in subischial leg length from -0.87 (0.67) to -0.63 (0.65) in the first year, to -0.58 (0.70) in the second year, and -0.80 (1.14) in the third year of treatment. 
Disseminated leiomyosarcoma in a child with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A child with disseminated leiomyosarcoma and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is reported. She was originally believed to have peptic ulcer disease by radiographic and endoscopic evaluation but was found subsequently to have hypergastrinemia, hypochlorhydria, and a smooth muscle tumor. Leiomyosarcoma in children and its evolution in AIDS are discussed. 
Improvement of cyclosporin absorption in children after liver transplantation by means of water-soluble vitamin E. Many childhood recipients of liver transplantation require massive doses of cyclosporin to achieve therapeutic blood concentrations of the drug. The impaired absorption of this strongly lipophilic drug may be due to reduced intestinal absorptive area, suboptimal mixing of the drug with hepatobiliary secretions, or residual cholestasis. Improvement of cyclosporin absorption was sought by means of oral coadministration of d-alpha-tocopheryl-polyethylene-glycol-1000 succinate (TPGS), a water-soluble form of vitamin E which can form micelles. 25 mg/kg daily of TPGS was given to six paediatric liver transplant recipients and one young adult with severe hepatobiliary graft-vs-host disease after bone-marrow transplantation, who required 29-136 mg/kg cyclosporin daily to achieve therapeutic cyclosporin blood concentrations. Five responded; the oral cyclosporin dose could be reduced by 40-72% within 2 months. In addition, intravenous cyclosporin was stopped in two of the responders. In the two non-responders the cyclosporin doses at entry were similar to those in the responders after TPGS treatment. Oral cyclosporin absorption tests correctly predicted the outcome of treatment in three responders and one non-responder tested. Treatment with TPGS to enhance cyclosporin absorption might be a useful way of reducing the high cost of immunosuppression in paediatric liver transplant recipients. 
Effect of coronary reocclusion after initial reperfusion on ventricular function and infarct size. Reocclusion of a coronary artery after thrombolytic therapy occurs in approximately 12% to 33% of patients; however, there are few experimental data concerning reocclusion. Accordingly, to compare the effects of reocclusion versus sustained occlusion on the myocardium, a canine model (n = 12) of 2 h of left circumflex artery occlusion, 1 h of reperfusion and 1 h of reocclusion was studied. In a control group (n = 11), 3 h of circumflex artery occlusion was followed by 1 h of reperfusion. As a result, both groups had the same total duration of ischemia (3 h) and reperfusion (1 h). Hemodynamic measurements, radioactive microsphere injections and two-dimensional echocardiography were performed at baseline, occlusion and reperfusion for both groups and at the end of reocclusion for the experimental group. In vivo risk area was determined with Evans blue dye and infarct size with triphenyltetrazolium staining methods. Similar decreases in myocardial blood flow after coronary occlusion and similar reperfusion blood flows occurred in both groups. Despite intervening reperfusion in the reocclusion group, no significant difference was found in the infarct size/risk area ratio between the reocclusion and control groups (54.5 +/- 6.9% vs. 48.4 +/- 5.1%, respectively, p = NS). Two-dimensional echocardiography demonstrated a similar degree and extent (159 +/- 9 degrees vs. 153 +/- 12 degrees, p = NS) of left ventricular dysfunction with both the occlusion and reocclusion. In addition, there were no significant differences in global or regional left ventricular function between the two groups. However, reocclusion after reperfusion did produce a further deterioration in ischemic zone wall thickening (9.5 +/- 2.0% to 0.7 +/- 1.8%, p less than 0.001). 
Hepatocellular carcinoma: treatment with a combination therapy of transcatheter arterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection. In an attempt to obtain complete tumor necrosis in large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions, the authors studied the clinical and histologic findings of a new combination therapy, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) (pretreatment with TAE and subsequent PEI) in 15 patients with a single, large (3.0-9.0 cm in diameter), encapsulated lesion of HCC. Two weeks after TAE, PEI was performed under ultrasound guidance. A total of four to 11 injections were administered at a rate of one injection twice a week. During the follow-up period (range, 7-23 months), all lesions were reduced in size and no evidence of HCC was present at contrast material-enhanced computed tomography or angiography in nine of 11 patients who did not subsequently undergo surgery. Six patients had a follow-up of 1 year or more, for a 1-year survival rate of 100%. Four patients subsequently underwent surgical resection; complete necrosis of the tumor was observed in all four. The authors conclude that a combination of PEI and TAE is an appropriate treatment for patients with large, encapsulated HCC lesions who are poor surgical risks. 
Simultaneous in situ genotyping and phenotyping of human papillomavirus cervical lesions: comparative sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of immunocytochemistry were compared with those of non-isotopic in situ hybridisation (NISH) for the direct detection of human papillomaviruses in biopsy specimens. Four monoclonal antibodies raised to the capsid protein of HPV16 were less specific than NISH: all four reacted with lesions containing HPV33, and HPV18. Absolute discrimination of HPV types, therefore, was not possible with the monoclonal antibodies used in this study. The relative sensitivities of these antibodies were also lower than NISH. Sequential immunocytochemistry and NISH on the same section showed that 2.9-13.0 times as many cells were positive by NISH than by immunocytochemistry using the most sensitive monoclonal antibody. These data indicate that NISH has higher diagnostic specificity and sensitivity than immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibodies to the HPV16 capsid protein. 
Intestinal mucosal permeability in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. II. Role of disease. Gut permeability as measured by the 51Cr-EDTA resorption test was determined in 56 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 73 patients with spondyloarthropathies (SpA), 18 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 97 controls (42 patients with no inflammatory rheumatic diseases and 55 healthy controls). Gut permeability was found to be increased in the 3 patient groups, partially due to the intake of antiinflammatory drugs. When only patients not taking these drugs were considered, an increased gut permeability was found in patients with SpA and IBD. In patients with RA gut permeability could not be evaluated as they were all taking antiinflammatory medication. Ileocolonoscopy with biopsies of the gut was performed in 62 of the 73 patients with SpA and disclosed subclinical gut inflammation in 21. No difference in gut permeability was found between patients with or without gut inflammation. However, when the type of gut inflammation was considered, a significant increase of gut permeability was found in patients with chronic gut inflammation compared with patients presenting acute lesions. Our findings again suggest that the chronic gut inflammation seen in SpA is fundamentally different from acute gut inflammation and possibly related to the gut inflammation of IBD. 
Positron emission tomography of pituitary macroadenomas: hormone production and effects of therapies. Positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was carried out in 24 patients with pituitary macroadenomas (32 studies) to assess the glucose utilization of these tumors in vivo. The adenoma metabolic index, which is the ratio of FDG uptake of tumor to a whole brain slice, was calculated. Comparisons were made between tumor uptake of FDG and hormone secretion and response to therapies. In each positron emission tomography study, the macroadenoma could be easily identified visually as an area of increased FDG uptake near the region of the sella. FDG uptakes were highest for nonfunctional adenomas, and the prolactin, growth hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone-producing groups displayed similar levels of glucose metabolism. The adenoma metabolic index for all tumors averaged 1.3, ranging from 0.3 for a thyroid-stimulating hormone adenoma to 3.5 for a nonfunctional tumor. Tumors did not exhibit metabolic rates that could characterize the type of hormone produced. Recurrent macroadenomas displayed metabolism similar to tumors not operated on, whereas irradiated adenomas showed lower glucose uptake than nonirradiated tumors. Drug therapy with bromocriptine or the long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide also decreased the glucose utilization of the tumor. There was no correlation between the amount of hormone produced and the adenoma metabolic index when a group of tumors was analyzed. Patients scanned more than once, however, demonstrated changes in hormone levels that changed or did not change in parallel with tumor metabolism. Thus, positron emission tomography offers the potential capability for predicting and defining the growth of pituitary adenomas. This may be of particular value when plasma hormone assays and conventional imaging techniques prove inadequate for monitoring patient response to therapy. 
Hypertonic saline dextran resuscitation during the initial phase of acute endotoxemia: effect on regional blood flow. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Small-volume resuscitation by means of bolus application of hypertonic saline solutions has been demonstrated to restore central hemodynamics and regional blood flow in severe hemorrhagic and traumatic shock. The aim of this study was to elucidate the potential of this new concept for treatment of profound hypovolemia and microcirculatory deterioration associated with sepsis and endotoxic shock. In a porcine model of acute hyperdynamic endotoxemia (elicited by continuous iv infusion of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin for 3.5 hrs), small-volume resuscitation applying hypertonic-hyperoncotic solutions was analyzed for its effect on central hemodynamics, oxygen delivery (Do2), and regional blood flow. Fluid therapy was initiated when the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP) tended to decrease (at 43 to 52 mins of endotoxemia), and consisted of 4 mL/kg bolus infusion of either 7.2% sodium chloride, 10% dextran, or 10% dextran in 7.2% sodium chloride; thereafter, PAOP was maintained by controlled infusion of 6% dextran-60. In a control group, 6% dextran-60 was given without preinjection of hypertonic-hyperoncotic solutions. RESULTS: On small-volume resuscitation, cardiac index significantly increased within 5 mins in all groups, while mean arterial pressure remained unchanged. Fluid requirements were significantly reduced after small-volume resuscitation and the hyperdynamic circulatory state was maintained until the end of the observation period; Do2 as well as blood flow to heart, kidneys, and splanchnic organs remained high. CONCLUSION: Small-volume resuscitation by means of hypertonic saline-dextran proved the most effective, and seems to be an attractive supportive therapy to prevent microcirculatory failure in sepsis and endotoxemia. 
The importance of preoperative evaluation of the subclavian vein in dialysis access planning. Adequate venous outflow is critical to the proper function of a vascular-access graft (arteriovenous fistula) used for chronic hemodialysis. Stenosis of the subclavian vein can significantly compromise this venous outflow. The development of such subclavian vein stenoses has been associated with the prior placement of temporary subclavian vein dialysis catheters. We evaluated the importance of preoperative detection of these stenoses before placement of a permanent vascular-access graft in the upper extremity. Upper extremity venography was performed before placement of a permanent vascular-access graft in 43 patients. A total of 62 extremities were evaluated. A 40% prevalence of moderate or severe subclavian vein stenosis was found in patients with prior or existing temporary dialysis catheters in the subclavian vein. No stenoses were found in patients without a history of dialysis catheters in the subclavian vein. This difference in the prevalence of subclavian vein stenosis is statistically significant (p less than .001). In no case was the stenosis suspected clinically. Before placement of a permanent vascular-access graft, the subclavian vein should be evaluated in all patients with a history of a temporary dialysis catheter in the subclavian vein. The use of sites other than the subclavian vein for temporary dialysis is strongly encouraged. 
Sarcoidosis presenting as an isolated intramedullary tumor. We report a case of isolated intramedullary sarcoidosis. The patient developed progressive signs that indicated a spinal tumor, which were investigated with contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging scans. Magnetic resonance imaging clearly revealed an intramedullary lesion, but the diagnosis of sarcoidosis was made on the pathological analysis of the surgical specimen. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast enhancement is reported in a histologically proven case of intramedullary sarcoidosis. Only 12 other cases of isolated intramedullary sarcoidosis have been reported. We review and discuss these cases according to their clinical presentation, the segmental location of the granulomas in the spinal cord, preoperative and operative diagnoses, and signs for systemic sarcoidosis. In none of the cases was the diagnosis of intramedullary sarcoidosis made before surgery. We think that surgical therapy for intramedullary lesions is the best way to diagnose rare instances of benign lesions like sarcoidosis and to treat them in an appropriate manner. 
Plasma gastrin and cholecystokinin response after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with Billroth-I type of reconstruction. Plasma gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) responses were measured after a pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) using the Billroth-I type reconstruction combined with distal partial gastrectomy (standard PD) and combined with preservation of the pylorus and the duodenal bulb (PPPD). Six unoperated patients, 4 men and 2 women, were studied as control subjects. Basal plasma levels of gastrin were significantly higher in controls than in patients who had a standard PD (p less than 0.05) and gastrin responses to a meal were also blunted in these patients. In contrast basal and postprandial levels of gastrin after PPPD were significantly higher than these found in patients with standard PD (p less than 0.05). Postprandial gastrin response after PPPD were similar in pattern to these found in controls. Integrated gastrin release after PPPD was less than that of the control but was significantly greater than that in patients with standard PD. Basal plasma levels of CCK in the patients after the standard PD were significantly lower than in controls and significantly higher postprandial levels of CCK were found after PPPD compared to standard PD (p less than 0.05). However integrated CCK from 0 to 120 minutes were not significantly different between PPPD and standard PD groups. Based on these observations concerning hormonal release of gastrin and CCK, preservation of the stomach and the duodenal bulb appears to be a more physiologic reconstructive procedure than the standard PD. In addition the operation probably has more beneficial effect on the injured pancreas in time. 
Preoperative and postoperative "aneurysm" associated with coarctation of the aorta. The reported incidence of aortic aneurysm after surgical repair or balloon angioplasty for aortic coarctation varies widely. To determine the incidence of aneurysm formation after surgery, preoperative and postoperative cineangiograms from 65 patients who underwent operation at age 1.5 +/- 3.4 years were examined. Repair included a prosthetic patch in 14 patients, end to end anastomosis in 28 and subclavian flap in 23. Aneurysm was documented by change in contour or irregularities in contour at the repair site or by abnormal dimensions at the repair site, defined by the ratio of the widest measurement at the repair site to the measurement of the aorta at the diaphragm. An aneurysmal bulge above the ductus diverticulum was identified in 14 (23%) of 60 patients preoperatively; the area showed no change 4.72 +/- 4.07 years after surgery. Significant changes at the repair site were seen in only three patients, all of whom had Dacron patch repair. One patient had a change in contour at the repair site, one had an abnormally high repair site to diaphragmatic aorta ratio and one had a progressive increase in this ratio. Thus, during childhood years, 3 (5%) of 65 patients were diagnosed as having aneurysm at the surgical repair site. In conclusion, 1) comparison with preoperative cineangiograms, especially for aneurysmal bulges above the ductus arteriosus, is essential before an aneurysm can be attributed to coarctation repair by any technique, and 2) aneurysm developed only in patients subjected to Dacron patch repair. 
Prognostic value of serum creatinine and effect of treatment of hypertension on renal function. Results from the hypertension detection and follow-up program. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program Cooperative Group. The Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program followed up 10,940 persons for 5 years in a community-based, randomized, controlled trial of treatment for hypertension. Participants were randomized to one of two treatment groups, stepped care and referred care. The primary end point of the study was all-cause mortality, with morbid events involving the heart, brain, and kidney as secondary end points. Loss of renal function, ascertained by a change in serum creatinine, was among these secondary events. Baseline serum creatinine concentration had a significant prognostic value for 8-year mortality. For persons with a serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl, 8-year mortality was more than three times that of all other participants. The estimated 5-year incidence of substantial decline in renal function was 21.7/1,000 in the stepped-care group and 24.6/1,000 in the referred-care group. Among persons with a baseline serum creatinine level between 1.5 and 1.7 mg/dl, the 5-year incidence of decline was 113.3/1,000 (stepped care) and 226.6/1,000 (referred care) (p less than 0.01). The incidence of decline in renal function was greater in men, blacks, and older adults, as well as in those with higher entry diastolic blood pressure. Among persons with a baseline serum creatinine level greater than or equal to 1.7 mg/dl, serum creatinine concentration declined by 25% or more in 28.6% of stepped-care and 25.2% of referred-care participants. Although the incidence of clinically significant hypercreatininemia in a hypertensive population is low, an elevated serum creatinine concentration is a very potent independent risk factor for mortality. The slightly lower rate of development of hypercreatininemia and the higher rate of improvement in stepped-care compared with referred-care participants is consistent with the belief that aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce renal damage and the associated increased risk of death. 
Integration of anticoagulation, thrombolysis and coronary angioplasty for unstable angina pectoris. Unstable angina pectoris remains a challenging acute ischemic syndrome to treat despite recent randomized trials that confirm the benefit of intravenous heparin. Coronary angioplasty, which is often required to treat the underlying arterial lesion, is adversely affected by the presence of thrombus with at least a 2-fold increase in abrupt closure. Four studies with heparin treatment prior to angioplasty indicate a reduction of abrupt vessel closure from 8-33% to 0-6% with apparent reduction of morbidity; no controlled trials are thus far available for heparin pretreatment. Another therapeutic alternative, thrombolytic therapy, has had quite equivocal results with several negative small studies. When angioplasty has been performed with thrombolytic therapy, a nonfibrin-specific plasminogen activator appears to be preferable. Newer studies that focus on thrombin inhibitors that bind to clot-bound thrombin and potent antiplatelet agents are in the early phase of clinical investigation. This review offers current recommendations for the integration of heparin, thrombolysis, and coronary angioplasty for unstable angina pectoris. 
DNA flow cytometric evaluation of serous and mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas. There have been few reports of flow cytometric studies of pancreatic neoplasms, whether endocrine or exocrine. In this report, the DNA content of three mucinous and seven serous cystic tumors of the pancreas was evaluated by flow cytometry on formaldehyde solution-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Two serous cystadenomas were aneuploid, with the remaining five serous and all three mucinous being diploid. All cases had a low S phase (ranging from 0.1% to 3.1%), indicating neoplasms with a low turnover. From these results, it appeared that DNA flow cytometry as an independent factor did not discriminate between the benign pancreatic serous cystadenomas and the more aggressive mucinous cystic neoplasms. 
Phase I-II trial of pentoxifylline for the prevention of transplant-related toxicities following bone marrow transplantation. Disease relapse and transplant related toxicities have limited the application of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in the treatment for hematologic malignancies. Because elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) have been correlated with the development of transplant related complications, we conducted a phase I-II trial of pentoxifylline (PTX), a xanthine derivative capable of down-regulating TNF-alpha production, in patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing BMT. Thirty consecutive adult patients (median age, 34) were entered and received either an allogeneic (n = 26) or autologous (n = 4) BMT. Patients were enrolled at increasing dose levels (1,200, 1,600, and 2,000 mg/d) from day -10 through day +100 posttransplant. PTX was well tolerated with no significant adverse side effects noted at any of the dose levels administered. The actuarial day 100 survival for these 30 patients was 90% (95% confidence interval 79% to 100%). When compared with a good risk control group, PTX recipients experienced less mucositis (3.7 +/- 1.1 v 18.7 +/- 1.1 days, P = .004), less hepatic venocclusive disease (10% v 65%, P = .001), a lower incidence of renal insufficiency (3% v 65%, P = .0003), required less days of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (24.0 +/- 1.3 v 35.0 +/- 2.4, P = .001) and were discharged from the hospital earlier than controls (day 26.0 +/- 1.8 v 37.0 +/- 3.8, P = .01). In addition the incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) greater than or equal to grade II was also reduced among the PTX recipients (35% v 68%, P = .03). PTX at doses in excess of 1,200 mg/d further reduced the severity of mucositis, and TPN requirements resulting in earlier hospital discharge than patients receiving 1,200 mg/d of PTX. In this study oral administration of PTX in doses up to 2,000 mg/d was well tolerated and associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing BMT. Prospective randomized trials are currently in progress to test these preliminary observations. 
Tumor vascularization: assessment with duplex sonography. In this prospective study, the authors examined 123 patients with benign or malignant neoplasms (breast cancer, n = 44; liver neoplasms, n = 43; and tumors affecting other organs, n = 36) to establish general criteria for evaluation of neoplastic lesions by means of duplex sonography. The frequency shifts determined by means of different Doppler frequencies (2.31 or 3.75 MHz) were converted into flow velocities. Only the highest systolic peak flow velocity obtained from a lesion was used for statistical evaluation. Receiver operating characteristic curves showed that a flow velocity of 0.4 m/sec is the optimal threshold value with which to differentiate benign from malignant tumors. The data obtained in all lesions indicated that only positive findings are potentially reliable. It is concluded that negative results of sonography should not be used to diagnose the presence of a benign lesion. The resistive index of the tumors was of negligible importance. 
Deforming arthropathy complicating primary biliary cirrhosis. A 53-year-old woman with concurrent systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) developed a deforming but minimally symptomatic arthropathy. The simultaneous occurrence of SLE and PBC is believed to be rare. Moreover, destructive arthritis, in the absence of serum rheumatoid factor, has not been previously reported with either disease. We review the association of liver disease with arthritis and propose a possible mechanism to account for the severe joint destruction seen in our patient. 
Evidence for alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in hypotensive cirrhotic patients with ascites. Cirrhosis with ascites is often characterized by arterial hypotension associated with increased plasma norepinephrine levels. Clinical evidence suggests a decreased sensitivity to norepinephrine in this clinical setting, indicating a potential derangement of alpha 1 adrenoreceptors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the reactivity of the alpha 1-adrenoreceptor, using phenylephrine, a selective alpha 1 receptor agonist. First, we evaluated the pupillar response to the intraconjunctival administration of the agonist. Hypotensive cirrhotic patients showed a trend to a more marked and prolonged response, compared with age-matched healthy controls. Second, we studied the response of alpha 1-adrenoreceptors in the peripheral vasculature by administering iv phenylephrine to a similar group of patients. A significantly greater and longer lasting pressor response was observed in hypotensive cirrhotic patients (p less than 0.0001 vs. healthy controls). Our results indicate that in this group of patients, there is a rather peculiar situation, characterized by alpha 1-adrenoreceptor hyperresponsiveness in the presence of high levels of circulating norepinephrine. This finding could be related to biochemical abnormalities within the peripheral sympathetic nervous system endings. 
Compound heterozygosity in nonphenylketonuria hyperphenylalanemia: the contribution of mutations for classical phenylketonuria. Hyperphenylalaninemia (HPA) results from defective hydroxylation of phenylalanine in the liver, in most cases because of defective phenylalanine hydroxylase. HPA is highly variable, ranging from moderate elevation of plasma phenylalanine with no clinical consequences to a severe disease, classical phenylketonuria (PKU). Non-PKU HPA was found in excess of PKU in Israel, while the opposite is true in Europe. To study the genetic basis of non-PKU HPA, we performed haplotype analysis at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in 27 families with non-PKU HPA. All individuals with this condition were compound heterozygotes. In six of these families, in which both PKU and non-PKU HPA were segregating, haplotype analysis showed that non-PKU HPA resulted from compound heterozygosity for a PKU mutation and a second mutation, with milder effect, which is probably expressed only when it interacts with the severe mutation. The involvement of PKU mutations in non-PKU HPA was further demonstrated in Jewish Yemenite families with non-PKU HPA, in which the individuals with this condition were carriers of the single PKU allele which exists in this community. In addition, two previously known PKU point mutations (R261Q and R408W) were found in individuals with non-PKU HPA. These mutations are associated, in our population, with the same haplotypes as those with which it is associated in Europe. Based on the above-mentioned genetic model for non-PKU HPA, successful prenatal diagnosis of this condition was performed in one family. 
In vivo pharmacology of DuP 753. A review of the in vivo pharmacology of DuP 753 (2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphen yl-4- yl)methyl]imidazole, potassium salt) is presented. In the pithed rat, DuP 753 exerted a selective and competitive inhibition of the pressor response to angiotensin II (AII). In conscious normotensive rats, DuP 753 inhibited the AII-induced aldosterone secretion and drinking response. DuP 753 lowered blood pressure in conscious normotensive rats pretreated with furosemide but not in untreated normotensive rats. Unlike saralasin, DuP 753 given intravenously did not cause pressor response. In conscious renal hypertensive rats (RHRs), a high renin model, DuP 753 decreased blood pressure with an intravenous ED30 of 0.78 mg/kg and an oral ED30 of 0.59 mg/kg. The antihypertensive efficacy of DuP 753 in RHRs was similar to that of captopril. In DOCA hypertensive rats, a low renin model, DuP 753 did not lower blood pressure. In conscious 18- to 21-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), DuP 753 given orally or intravenously reduced blood pressure dose-dependently and did not alter heart rate at these doses. The acute antihypertensive efficacy of DuP 753 was greater than that of captopril in SHRs. In contrast, DuP 753 and captopril given orally at 10 mg/kg/day for 15 days in SHRs caused a similar decrease in blood pressure. Bilateral nephrectomy but not inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis abolished the antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 in SHRs. Our study, therefore, indicates that DuP 753 is an orally active, nonpeptide, selective, and competitive AII receptor antagonist lacking agonism. It appears that there is a relationship between basal renin level and the acute antihypertensive effect of DuP 753 in rats. Further, our results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays a significant role in the control of blood pressure in conscious SHRs. 
Intermediate term results of infant orthotopic cardiac transplantation from two centers. Orthotopic cardiac transplantation has become established for selected infants with severe forms of congenital heart disease. This study reviews the combined experience and intermediate term results of infants undergoing orthotopic cardiac transplantation from Children's Memorial Hospital, Chicago, and Kosair Children's Hospital, Louisville. From June 1986 through December 1989, 20 orthotopic cardiac transplantations were performed in 19 patients. Sixteen patients had variants of hypoplastic left heart syndrome. One infant had anomalous origin of the left coronary artery with severe ischemic cardiomyopathy. Two infants had aortic stenosis with endocardial fibroelastosis, and one had extracorporeal membrane oxygenation as a bridge to transplantation. Immunosuppression included cyclosporine, azathioprine (Imuran), and corticosteroids with an effort to wean the patients from steroids by 6 months to 2 years. Three early deaths resulted--from technical errors in two patients and from hyperacute rejection in one patient at 3 days. Four late deaths have occurred. Two patients died at 2 and 13 months of acute rejection. One patient died at 15 months of acute rejection after retransplantation. One patient died at 7 months of respiratory syncytial viral pneumonia. The remaining 12 patients are surviving 5 to 47 months (means 20 months) after orthotopic cardiac transplantation. Rejection surveillance in the first 6 months is by clinical signs supplemented by echocardiography, electrocardiography, and cell cycle analysis; endomyocardial biopsy is used after 6 months of age. For the cumulative series, 24 episodes of suspected rejection have been treated during 277 at-risk patient months with intravenous methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol) (n = 18) and monoclonal antibody (OKT3) (n = 6), for an incidence of 1.04 episodes of rejection per patient per year. Serious posttransplantation infections including endocarditis, catheter sepsis, meningitis, and colonic perforation were successfully treated in four patients. Subjectively, their quality of life is excellent as shown by normal growth and developmental milestones and a low hospital readmission rate (1.4 episodes per patient per year). These encouraging intermediate term results warrant continued application of infant orthotopic cardiac transplantation for severe forms of congenital heart disease. 
Urinary tract calculi that form on surgical staples: a characteristic radiologic appearance. An autostapler is frequently used when bowel is interposed in the urinary tract during reconstructive urologic surgery in children. Usually the metallic staples are buried beneath the intestinal mucosa. However, if a portion of a staple is unintentionally left exposed or becomes exposed through migration and is then bathed by urine, it can become the nidus for formation of a calculus. The radiologic studies of 30 patients having surgery of this type in our hospital from 1980 to 1990 were reviewed prospectively, and stones were found to have developed on staples in eight patients. None of the patients had metabolic abnormalities. The stones were easily visible on plain radiographs because they were calcified. They formed in the lumen of the bladder or the bowel segment on the exposed portion of the staple. Thus, the staple was eccentric in the calculus and not central, as is usually the case with a stone forming on a foreign body. This experience suggests that stones forming on surgical staples during reconstructive urologic surgery have a characteristic radiologic appearance that may aid in their identification. 
Sleep-induced periodic breathing and apnea: a theoretical study. To elucidate the mechanisms that lead to sleep-disordered breathing, we have developed a mathematical model that allows for dynamic interactions among the chemical control of respiration, changes in sleep-waking state, and changes in upper airway patency. The increase in steady-state arterial PCO2 accompanying sleep is shown to be inversely related to the ventilatory response to CO2. Chemical control of respiration becomes less stable during the light stage of sleep, despite a reduction in chemoresponsiveness, due to a concomitant increase in "plant gain" (i.e., responsiveness of blood gases to ventilatory changes). The withdrawal of the "wakefulness drive" during sleep onset represents a strong perturbation to respiratory control: higher magnitudes and rates of withdrawal of this drive favor instability. These results may account for the higher incidence of periodic breathing observed during light sleep and sleep onset. Periodic ventilation can also result from repetitive alternations between sleep onset and arousal. The potential for instability is further compounded if the possibility of upper airway occlusion is also included. In systems with high controller gains, instability is mediated primarily through chemoreflex overcompensation. However, in systems with depressed chemoresponsiveness, rapid sleep onset and large blood gas fluctuations trigger repetitive episodes of arousal and hyperpnea alternating with apneas that may or may not be obstructive. Between these extremes, more complex patterns can arise from the interaction between chemoreflex-mediated oscillations of shorter-cycle-duration (approximately 36 s) and longer-wavelength (approximately 60-80 s) state-driven oscillations. 
Neuroeffector functions of sensory fibres: implications for headache mechanisms and drug actions. The results of recent investigations designed to elucidate the neuroeffector functions of sensory fibres, the cause of migraine headache and the mechanism of action of antimigraine drugs are reviewed and discussed. Neurogenic inflammation (vasodilatation and neurogenic plasma extravasation) is one explanation for the development of headaches and the blood flow changes which occur during migraine headache. Numerous studies have recently been carried out on rats and guinea-pigs into the effects of antimigraine agents, including ergot alkaloids, sumatriptan and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), on neurogenic plasma protein extravasation in the dura mater induced by electrical stimulation of trigeminal ganglia or systemic administration of capsaicin. It is known that the dura mater is able to produce headaches in man. Ergot alkaloids have been shown to block neurogenic inflammation via a C-fibre dependent neuronal mechanism. Sumatriptan appears to act fairly similarly although, whereas the ergot alkaloids are non-selective for either 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) receptors or 5-HT1, sumatriptan is selective for 5-HT1 receptors. The antimigraine action of NSAIDs may be via either an effect on blood vessels or an effect on the nerve fibre. The antimigraine effects of ergot alkaloids, sumatriptan and NSAIDs are discussed in the light of the common vasoconstrictor actions of these agents and knowledge that vasodilatation is apparently not responsible for migraine headache pain in most cases. 
Degree of coronary artery disease predicted by exercise testing. The ability of exercise testing to predict the extent of coronary artery disease was examined in 268 male patients undergoing both coronary angiography and bicycle testing with electrocardiography before coronary artery bypass surgery. When maximal ST-depressions limited by symptoms increased from 0 to 4 mm or more, the percentage of patients with 'serious' coronary disease, defined as either triple vessel disease or left main stem stenosis, increased from 50% to 80% (P = 0.0001). The patients in the lowest third of physical work capacity showed only a slightly increased risk of serious disease. This tendency was abolished in patients who were using beta-blockers, whereas the relationship between ST-depression and disease was not affected by this medication. The probability of finding left main stem stenosis in a patient increased from 5 to 30% with increasing ST-depression: beta-blockers did not affect this relationship, but there was no additional predictive effect of implicating the level of physical work capacity. It is concluded that traditional electrocardiography during exercise is of value when selecting patients for angiography, but that the physical work level obtained during the test does not predict the degree of coronary pathology. 
Anticonvulsant activity of two orally active competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists, CGP 37849 and CGP 39551, against sound-induced seizures in DBA/2 mice and photically induced myoclonus in Papio papio. Two novel N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists, DL-(E)-2-amino-4-methyl-5-phosphono-3-pentenoic acid CPG 37849 and the corresponding 1-ethyl ester CGP 39551, were tested as anticonvulsants in DBA/2 mice and photosensitive Senegalese baboons, Papio papio. In DBA/2 mice, CGP 37849 is more potent than CGP 39551 when administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) (ED50 for suppression of clonic seizures at 60 min: i.c.v. 0.038 and 0.21 nmol; i.p. 3.40 and 19.1 mumol/kg, respectively). When administered orally in mice, the two compounds are approximately equipotent (ED50 CGP 37849, 35.2 mumol/kg; ED50 CGP 39551, 28.1 mumol/kg). The time course of action of CGP 39551 is exceptionally prolonged: 42 mumol/kg i.p. protects against clonic seizures for 48 h. Protection provided by other NMDA antagonists in mice is of much shorter duration: 2-amino-5-phosphono-pentanoic acid (AP5) 1 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid (AP7) 4 h, 2-amino-7-phosphono-heptanoic acid 1-ethyl ester 3 h, 4-(3-phosphonopropyl)-2-piperazine carboxylic acid (CPP) 2 h, cis-4-(phosphonomethyl)-2-piperidine-carboxylic acid (CGS 19755) 4 h, and CGP 37849 4 h. After oral administration of the drugs, the therapeutic index (TI = ratio of the ED50 values for rotorod performance and anticonvulsant protection) remains relatively constant at 5.9-7.2 for 3 h (CGP 37849) and 4.0-6.1 for 24 h (CGP 39551). After i.p. administration, the TI values are CGP 37849 at 1 h 2.4, and at 3 h 20.0, CGP 39551 at 1 h 2.3, at 3 h 7.1, and at 24 h 3.6. In baboons, acute administration of CGP 37849 at doses of 48-191 mumol/kg intravenously (i.v.) suppresses photically induced myoclonus for at least 285 min, with severe side effects at the highest dose tested. CGP 39551 at doses of 169-675 mumol/kg i.v. shows weak anticonvulsant activity only at the highest dose tested (accompanied by severe side effects). CGP 37849 at 48-96 mumol/kg orally (p.o.) fails to protect against photically induced myoclonus up to 4 h after administration, but 191 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces complete suppression of seizures after 24 h. On the other hand, CGP 39551 at 169 mumol/kg (40 mg/kg) p.o. produces total suppression of seizure activity at 4 h with a longer duration of anticonvulsant action (2-3 days).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Mechanism of shock associated with right ventricular infarction. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the shock sometimes associated with right ventricular infarction, but only small numbers of patients with clinical shock have been studied. The haemodynamic profiles of seven patients with clinical cardiogenic shock after right ventricular myocardial infarction were studied prospectively. They were selected because all had a stable cardiac rhythm and none had absolute hypovolaemia during the study period. In all of them the mean right atrial pressure exceeded the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. After treatment with varying combinations of dopamine, dobutamine, and glyceryl trinitrate (titrated to achieve the optimum haemodynamic response) the mean systemic arterial pressure increased, as did the cardiac index. There was an associated increase in the left ventricular stroke work index but the right ventricular stroke work index was unchanged. There was no significant change in heart rate, mean right atrial pressure, or pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. This suggests that the probable mechanism of the shock associated with right ventricular infarction is concomitant severe left ventricular dysfunction. 
Cost-effectiveness analysis of paramedic emergency medical services in the treatment of prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest. STUDY OBJECTIVES: 1) Identification of marginal costs associated with prehospital resuscitation of cardiopulmonary arrest; 2) Determination of cost effectiveness for such resuscitation; and 3) Comparison of cost effectiveness of paramedic care with selected other medical interventions. DESIGN: Retrospective review of 190 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. SETTING: City limits of a midsized southwestern city. The events studied took place outside of medical facilities. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Victims of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest for whom the EMS system was activated by a 911 telephone request for emergency medical assistance. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cost, including training, personnel, equipment, and response time maintenance, per year of life saved was found to be $8,886.00 for paramedic care. This result was compared with published cost-effectiveness figures for heart transplantation, liver transplantation, bone marrow transplantation, and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. Paramedic care was more cost effective, as measured by cost per year of life saved, than organ transplantation and chemotherapy for acute leukemia. CONCLUSION: Out-of-hospital treatment by paramedics of cardiopulmonary arrest is more cost effective than heart, liver, bone marrow transplantation, or curative chemotherapy for acute leukemia. 
Prospects for the use of antagonists to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor to prevent post-angioplasty restenosis and thrombosis. Despite many advances since its inception in humans in 1977, coronary angioplasty continues to be limited by the problems of abrupt arterial closure and late restenosis. Excessive platelet deposition at the site of angioplasty undoubtedly plays an important role in the pathophysiology of both of these problems. Monoclonal antibodies and snake venom-derived or synthetic peptides directed against a common protein recognition sequence on the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor are currently in the early stages of preclinical and clinical testing and hold promise of preventing abrupt closure and restenosis by inhibiting platelet function. Whether any of these agents will eventually be commonly used in clinical practice will depend on their effects on the complex pathophysiology of these problems and on their safety profile when administered to patients who are likely to receive other antithrombotic medications and who are instrumented for coronary angioplasty. 
Effective treatment of small-noncleaved-cell lymphoma with high-intensity, brief-duration chemotherapy. Small-noncleaved-cell (SNC) lymphoma is a high-grade, biologically aggressive neoplasm notable for poor response to therapy, high relapse rate, and less than a 20% long-term survival. We treated 20 patients with SNC lymphoma with a novel chemotherapeutic regimen using intensive doses of chemotherapy at frequent intervals in the inpatient setting. All patients were previously untreated. Sixteen patients (80%) had stage IV disease. Most patients (95%) had at least one other characteristic associated with poor prognosis (bulky [greater than 10 cm] disease, multiple extranodal sites, poor performance status), and 85% had two or more characteristics associated with poor prognosis. Seventeen patients (85%) achieved a complete response (CR) to therapy, including all three patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated disease. There have been three relapses, all occurring less than 18 months after treatment, and two of three relapses occurred in patients who were unable to complete therapy. At a median follow-up of 29 months, 13 patients (65%) remain disease-free; the calculated 5-year actuarial disease-free survival is 60%. Toxicity, chiefly myelosuppression, was severe but manageable. There were two treatment-related deaths, both in elderly patients with poor performance status and advanced-stage disease. These data suggest that such a dose-intensive approach improves the response and survival of patients with SNC lymphoma. 
The transient appearance of small blastoid cells in the marrow after bone marrow transplantation. Of 14 patients who underwent allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, 6 had a transient appearance of small blastoid cells in the bone marrow after transplantation. Most of these patients (11) had leukemia, although 3 had severe aplastic anemia. The cells were 8-18 micron in diameter and had scant cytoplasm and dense nuclei with smooth, homogeneous chromatin. They often had distinct nuclear clefts. These cells constituted 4.0-21.3% of the total number of bone marrow cells. They were not reactive with peroxidase, alpha-naphtyl butylate esterase, naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase, or periodic acid-Schiff stains. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the small blastoid cells expressed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, Ia-like, CD19, and CD10 antigens and cytoplasmic mu heavy chains, indicating a precursor B-cell phenotype. CD20 antigen was not expressed on these cells. The data suggest that cytoplasmic mu may be expressed earlier than CD20 antigen in the differentiation of B-cell lineage. The morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic characteristics did not distinguish these nonneoplastic cells distinctly from leukemic lymphoblastic cells. The increase of small blastoid cells was a transient and self-limited phenomenon, in contrast to that of neoplastic blasts. These cells should be recognized as a common component of the bone marrow of marrow transplant recipients. The significance and role of these cells in immune recovery and hematopoiesis remain uncertain. 
Mitral valve replacement in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is an eosinophil-mediated tissue injury causing multiple organ failure. Cardiac manifestations include subendocardial fibrosis, thrombus leading to peripheral emboli, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and valvar dysfunction. This article describes a patient with the syndrome and reviews surgical experience with valve replacement and long-term prognosis. 
Transrectal US in the diagnosis of localized colitis cystica profunda. Colitis cystica profunda (CCP) mimicks rectal carcinoma, which makes distinguishing this benign lesion from the more common rectal neoplasm clinically and pathologically difficult. When transrectal ultrasound (US) was used in this case, three features of CCP were seen. There were multiple lesions, which did not penetrate beyond the submucosa. A large cystic component was seen, with a layer of uniform thickness in two of the three lesions. Non-solid contents and a lack of infiltration can be visualized at transrectal US, which helps diagnose CCP. 
Headache syndromes as detected by configural frequency analysis. Data on headache symptoms obtained in two samples (N = 422 and 304) by means of questionnaires were subjected to configural frequency analysis (CFA). This not widely-known method tests whether certain symptom combinations appear more often or less often than expected by chance. In both samples symptom combinations corresponding to the syndromes of migraine with aura, migraine without aura and tension headache did indeed occur with significant frequency. The same clear-cut symptom patterns appeared when patients with preceding visual disturbances were excluded from analysis. These results seem to lend strong support to a categorical model of headache, rather than to the concept of headache as a spectrum. 
Recurrence after radiotherapy for glottic carcinoma. A series of 478 patients with T1-3N0 glottic carcinoma treated by irradiation is presented. Of these patients, 320 were previously untreated, whereas 158 patients were referred for treatment of a recurrence after receiving radiotherapy elsewhere. The primary recurrence rate in the previously untreated patients was 10%. The rate was higher in T2 and T3 tumors, poorly differentiated tumors, and in patients who were in poor general condition. Over 80% of the recurrent tumors were Stage pT3 or pT4, whereas 12% of total laryngectomy specimens showed necrosis only with no evidence of tumor. The necrosis rate in previously untreated patients was 1% for T1 tumors, 4% for T2 tumors, and 3% for T3 tumors. Of all tumors, 60% were transglottic when they recurred, whereas only 29% were confined to the glottis at recurrence. Histologic diagnosis had a high sensitivity but a low specificity, indicating that a negative histologic report is unreliable. Of patients with a recurrent primary tumor, 13% were untreatable. The 5-year survival after a primary recurrence was 39%, and the main prognostic factors were sex, T stage at recurrence, and time to recurrence. Of patients available for follow-up at 5 years 49% were alive with a larynx, 5% were alive without a larynx, 13% were dead of the original cancer, and 33% had died of other causes. In those suffering a primary recurrence, the commonest cause of death was a subsequent lymph node metastasis, followed in order of frequency by stomal recurrence and recurrence in the pharyngeal remnant. The hospital mortality rate after laryngectomy was 3%, and 30% of patients undergoing laryngectomy developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula. The recurrence rate in lymph nodes was 14% at 5 years, general condition and T stage being the only significant predictors of recurrence. Only 17% of patients had small (N1) nodes by the time the diagnosis of cervical lymph node recurrence was made, and 27% of all patients were unsuitable for treatment. Host, tumor factors, and time to recurrence were not significant predictors of survival after node recurrence. The survival rate 5 years after node recurrence was 16%, and the main cause of death in those who died was uncontrolled disease in the neck. The hospital mortality after salvage neck dissection was 4.7%. 
Pulse oximetry monitoring outside the intensive care unit: progress or problem? OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of continuous pulse oximetry monitoring in general care units. DESIGN: Hemoglobin oxygen saturation data collected prospectively by use of pulse oximetry with concurrent review of the medical record. SETTING: General medical-surgical nursing units in a large, tertiary care university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty patients on two nursing units monitored with continuous, bedside pulse oximetry at the request of their primary physicians. MEASUREMENTS: All patients had continuous pulse oximetry monitoring. A research associate visited the bedside two or three times daily and recorded saturation compared with time data from the previous 8.75 hours. Patients were studied for 36 hours or until pulse oximetry monitoring was discontinued. Episodes of desaturation were counted. Patient charts were reviewed for documentation of desaturation in either nursing or physician notes. Orders adjusting oxygen therapy or other respiratory therapy within 12 hours of any desaturation episode were also recorded. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty of the 40 patients (75%) had at least one episode of desaturation to less than 90%; 23 (58%) had at least one episode to less than 85%. Desaturation episodes were documented in nursing notes for only 33% of those patients who desaturated to less than 90% and in physician notes in only 7% of cases. Changes in respiratory therapy were ordered in 20% of patients who desaturated to less than 90% and in only 26% who desaturated to less than 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Despite their repeated occurrence, episodes of hypoxemia were rarely documented in either nursing or physician notes. Further, even in patients who had episodic desaturation, pulse oximetry monitoring had little effect on changes in physician-directed respiratory care. 
Fatty infiltration in the liver in medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Fatty infiltration of the liver at postmortem examination has been recommended as a criterion for selection of infants who have died suddenly and unexpectedly for further biochemical investigation for disorders of fatty acid oxidation. We describe a boy with medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency who died four months after diagnosis and in whom only minimal hepatic fatty infiltration was found. 
Peripheral neuropathy after chronic endoneurial ischemia. We have developed a method for producing chronic regional nerve ischemia in rats by creating proximal limb arteriovenous shunts. This procedure results in a 50 to 75% reduction in endoneurial blood flow within the distal sciatic nerve as measured by the iodoantipyrine method. Nerve conduction velocities in sciatic nerves ipsilateral to the shunt fell by 25 to 30% within 2 weeks after creation of the shunt and did not recover for up to 10 months after the procedure. Morphological studies of the ischemic nerves showed structural abnormalities at nodes of Ranvier and mild axonal atrophy. Neither segmental demyelination nor axonal degeneration were evident. These results indicate that reduced endoneurial blood flow, insufficient to cause infarction, may result in measurable functional and morphological abnormalities in peripheral nerves. 
Clinical comparison of polyglactic acid (Vicryl) and polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon) suture material. Over a 1-year period, 584 repairs of surgical defects were completed using two different synthetic absorbable sutures, polyglactic acid (Vicryl) and polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon). No difference in scar width or postoperative complications were found between the two sutures, but polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon) demonstrated preferable handling and tying characteristics. 
Low energy catheter ablation of right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia. A 38 year old woman with a structurally normal heart presented with near syncope and had right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia. She was intolerant of antiarrhythmic medication and underwent low energy catheter ablation. Six non-arcing shocks of 25 J were delivered to the right ventricular outflow tract. No further ventricular tachycardia occurred during a follow up of seven months without antiarrhythmic treatment. 
Fixed subaortic stenosis: anatomical spectrum and nature of progression. Retrospective echocardiographic review identified 58 consecutive infants and children with fixed subaortic stenosis. Mean (SD) age at diagnosis was 4.8 (3.6) years (range two days to 14.7 years), and diagnosis occurred in infancy in eight. Associated cardiac abnormalities were present in 41 (71%) whereas fixed subaortic stenosis was an isolated lesion in 17 (29%). Four types of fixed subaortic stenosis were identified: short segment (47 (81%)), long segment (7 (12%)), posterior displacement of the infundibular septum with additional discrete narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract (3 (5%)), and redundant tissue arising from the membranous septum (1 (2%)). Echocardiographic studies had been performed before the diagnosis of fixed subaortic stenosis in nine patients, all with associated abnormalities. These were performed in infancy in each and showed a "normal" left ventricular outflow tract in six and posterior deviation of the infundibular septum in three. In 16 patients serial echocardiographic studies had been performed after the diagnosis of fixed subaortic stenosis but before surgery of the left ventricular outflow tract. Rapid evolution of short segment to long segment narrowing was seen in one patient, and tethering of the aortic valve or mitral valve developed in a further four patients. Aortic valve or mitral valve involvement was not seen before the age of three years but was common thereafter (10/40 patients, 25%). Fixed subaortic stenosis may be an "acquired" lesion with the potential for changes in form as well as progression in severity of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. 
Limited hepatic resection for selected cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular or cholangiocellular carcinoma: a prospective study. From 1 January 1983 to 1 January 1989 123 cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular cancer (n = 122) or cholangiocarcinoma (n = 1) were screened using liver function tests, alpha-fetoprotein determination, ultrasonography with biopsy (and in selected cases computed tomography or nuclear magnetic resonance), laparoscopy and angiography, Child-Pugh classification and urea-nitrogen synthesis rate. Twenty-three patients were selected for surgical resection because the tumour was smaller than 5 cm, not centrally located and at least 1 cm away from main structures; there was no evidence of multicentricity or metastatic disease; and the Child-Pugh classification was A or B and the urea-nitrogen synthesis rate at least 6 g/day. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was used routinely to identify oesophageal varices which were present in 17 cases; ten patients with a history of variceal haemorrhage (43 per cent) had preoperative endoscopic sclerotherapy. In cases with recurrent haemorrhage, surgery was used to prevent intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. Tumour resection was carried out using controlled hypotension and hepatoduodenal ligament clamping. Twelve bisegmentectomies, ten segmentectomies and one atypical resection were performed. The operative mortality rate was 13 per cent with liver failure and sepsis as the causes of death. The 'recurrence rate' was 26 per cent and the late mortality rate for the whole group up to 1 January 1990 was 30 per cent; 13 patients were still alive. The 12-month survival rate was 77 per cent and after 5 years it was 49 per cent. Thus, surgical resection of small liver tumours is the treatment of choice in this selected group of patients. 
The malignant nature of papillary and cystic neoplasm of the pancreas. Two new cases of papillary and cystic neoplasm of the pancreas are reported. One patient was a 20-year-old woman with massive unresectable liver metastases, and the other was a 15-year-old boy. To study the natural history and malignant potential of this tumor, the English literature was reviewed to obtain an additional 56 cases. Clinical characteristics include pain and a mass in most patients, although many are found incidentally. Jaundice, hemoperitoneum, nausea, and vomiting are unusual findings. Most patients are treated by wide resection with good results. These tumors appear to be indolent. However, 16% of patients had major organ or blood vessel invasion, and 7% had liver metastases at some time during the course of their disease, illustrating the malignant nature of this tumor. Long-term follow-up is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of treatment, especially in the case of locally advanced and metastatic disease. 
Hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis after chronic administration of alcohol and "low-dose" carbon tetrachloride vapor in the rat Rats were exposed to carbon tetrachloride vapor, 5 days/wk, 6 hr/day, for periods of 5 or 10 wk at a concentration that by itself caused only fatty change with minimal liver cell necrosis and no fibrosis. The same carbon tetrachloride exposure when given in association with chronic alcohol feeding resulted in extensive hepatic fibrosis at 5 wk and established micronodular cirrhosis at 10 wk. The periodicity of the exposure profile was chosen to simulate that of human exposure to environmental toxins, albeit at a higher dose than would be permitted in the workplace. The development of significant liver injury in this animal model raises the possibility that some chronic liver injury in humans may be due to alcohol potentiation of other hepatotoxins present in the environment at subtoxic levels.
