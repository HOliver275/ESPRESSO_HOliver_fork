4	Streptococcal antibody cross-reactivity with HLA-DR4+VE B-lymphocytes. Basis of the DR4 associated genetic predisposition to rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease? [published erratum appears in Br J Rheumatol 1991 Jun;30(3):222] B-lymphocytes obtained from patients with either rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease and from normal subjects were reacted with serum obtained from rabbits immunized with streptococcal cell wall antigen. The presence of cytotoxicity was sought using an inverted phase microscope after differential uptake of eosin dye. The serum was found to be significantly more cytotoxic to HLA-DR4 containing cells of both patients and normals compared with DR4 negative cells (P less than 0.0001). 
1	Deep femoral lymphadenectomy with preservation of the fascia lata. Preliminary report on 42 invasive vulvar carcinomas. Forty-two patients with primary invasive vulvar carcinoma were treated with radical vulvectomy and deep femoral lymphadenectomy with preservation of the fascia lata and cribriform fascia. The rationale for using this technique was based on anatomic knowledge of the topographic distribution of groin lymph nodes, which was confirmed by the study of 50 cadavers. The preliminary data show that the number of superficial and deep femoral lymph nodes removed from the 42 patients (mean number of nodes, 20; range, 8-32) was similar to the number reported in anatomy books. In addition, the five-year actuarial survival rate, 70%, was comparable to that in the literature. These preliminary results suggest that the surgical technique used in this study is as radical an oncologic procedure as Way's classic groin lymphadenectomy, which consists of removing the fascia lata and cribriform fascia. 
5	Monosomy 22 in rhabdoid or atypical tumors of the brain. Cytogenetic studies of three rare childhood brain tumors were performed. Two children presented with pure rhabdoid tumors. The third child had a tumor composed of a mixture of rhabdoid elements with neuroepithelial, epithelial, and mesenchymal tissue - an atypical teratoid tumor. All three tumors demonstrated monosomy 22 as the only cytogenetic abnormality. The cytogenetic findings suggest that loss of a gene or genes on chromosome 22 may be involved in the initiation or progression of these malignant tumors. Further studies on additional fresh tumor specimens are warranted; however, it is possible that cytogenetic studies may be used as an additional means of diagnosing rhabdoid or atypical teratoid tumors of the brain. 
3	Profiles of opioid analgesia in humans after intravenous bolus administration: alfentanil, fentanyl and morphine compared on experimental pain. This report examines the relationship of plasma drug concentration to analgesic effect following bolus doses of alfentanil, fentanyl and morphine and assesses individual differences in analgesic response among volunteers. We predicted that the 3 opioids would yield disparate analgesic profiles because their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics differ. Ten healthy volunteers received intravenous bolus doses of either alfentanil, fentanyl, morphine or normal saline on different days. We stimulated their teeth electrically and measured brain evoked potential (EP) and pain report (PR) repeatedly over 2 h to assess analgesic effect. Concurrently, we drew 18 blood samples to assess opioid plasma concentrations during the test period. The relationship between opioid plasma concentration and analgesic effect was well defined for alfentanil but ambiguous for morphine. Fentanyl exhibited a marked hysteresis. We observed noteworthy individual differences in analgesic response with all 3 drugs but these differences were greatest for morphine and least for alfentanil. Inter- and intrasubject variability in analgesic response across drugs is related to the physicochemical properties of the drugs tested. 
5	High hemoglobin A2 beta 0-thalassemia due to a 532-basepair deletion of the 5' beta-globin gene region. We identify and characterize a novel beta 0-thalassemia mutation that is associated with an unusually high level of hemoglobin (Hb) A2 in the heterozygote. This newly discovered mutation is caused by a 532-basepair deletion that extends from positions -454 to + 78 relative to the mRNA cap site of the beta-globin gene. The propositi are 9-month-old fraternal twins. One of the twins is a compound heterozygote for the deletion and Hb S, the other is a compound heterozygote for the deletion and Hb C. 
4	Characterization of LY233569 on 5-lipoxygenase and reperfusion injury of ischemic myocardium. LY233569 produced concentration-dependent inhibition of isolated guinea pig 5-lipoxygenase (5-LPO) and 5-LPO activity of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in vitro; IC50 values were 0.4 and 0.1 microM, respectively. LY233569 also inhibited (IC50 approximately 1.8 microM) zymosan-stimulated production of leukotriene B4 in canine whole blood but had little or no concomitant effect on the production of thromboxane B2. Concentrations of LY233569 as high as 10 microM did not inhibit production or scavenge superoxide from activated human neutrophils. In normal anesthetized dogs, infusion of LY233569 (0.11 mg/kg/min, i.v.) for 6 hr produced persistent inhibition (approximately 80%) of leukotriene B4 production in blood challenged ex vivo with zymosan; the plasma concentration (approximately 4 microM) of LY233569 was consistent with in vitro data illustrating selective and maximal inhibition of 5-LPO. In subsequent experiments, myocardial infarct size was measured after 1 hr of occlusion of the circumflex coronary artery and 5 hr of reperfusion. Continuous infusion of LY233569 (0.11 mg/kg/min, i.v.) had little or no effect on base-line systolic arterial pressure, cardiac rate and the pressure rate product when compared with time-related changes observed in control dogs. LY233569 infusion also did not alter the degree of ST-segment deviation or the intensity and duration of cardiac arrhythmias associated with coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion. Resultant myocardial infarct sizes were 45 +/- 5% of the left ventricle placed at risk in control dogs and 43 +/- 4% in dogs given LY233569. Myeloperoxidase activity of infarcted myocardium did not differ between groups. 
5	Characterization of an interleukin-6-mediated autocrine growth loop in the human multiple myeloma cell line, U266. It has been reported recently that freshly isolated human myeloma cell cultures proliferate in response to added interleukin-6 (IL-6). Endogenous levels of IL-6 found in the same cultures suggested that an autocrine growth loop may contribute to cell growth. However, the lack of homogenous cell populations in primary myeloma cultures has made it difficult to distinguish between paracrine and autocrine growth mechanisms. To precisely address the autocrine growth issue we have evaluated the growth of the human myeloma cell line, U266. We have found that a neutralizing anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody can inhibit U266 proliferation. Furthermore, the addition of IL-6 antisense oligonucleotides also inhibits U266 proliferation. These effects are reversed by adding IL-6, suggesting the presence of an autocrine loop. Using bioassays with two different IL-6-dependent cell lines, we were able to detect IL-6 in concentrated U266 supernatants. IL-6 mRNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of cDNA. Cell cycle parameter analysis shows that IL-6 acts to release a block in G1. Taken together these results present conclusive evidence for IL-6-mediated autocrine growth in the U266 human myeloma cell line. 
4	The effects of indomethacin and a beta-sympathomimetic agent on the fetal ductus arteriosus during treatment of premature labor: a randomized double-blind study. To study the effect of maternal indomethacin or nylidrine hydrochloride treatment on the fetus ductus arteriosus and the pulmonary artery, 27 women with threatened preterm labor between 24 and 34 weeks' gestation were studied by echocardiography. Fourteen women were treated with indomethacin and 13 with nylidrin. Both systolic and diastolic velocities in the ductus increased after administration of indomethacin indicating constriction in nine fetuses, and exceeded the corresponding velocities in the fetuses of the nylidrin group (p = 0.001). However, there were no changes in pulmonary artery flow velocities (p greater than 0.5). In the indomethacin group, there was a significant linear positive relationship between the gestational age and the change in ductal flow velocity. Three of the nine patients with ductal constriction also had tricuspid regurgitation. These findings indicate that indomethacin, not nylidrin, causes transient constriction of the ductus arteriosus and the constrictive response increases with the gestational age. We recommend echocardiographic surveillance of fetal hemodynamics when prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors are used in the treatment of spontaneous preterm labor. 
1	Psychosocial adjustment in women with breast cancer. There is a plethora of studies investigating psychosocial adjustment in women with breast cancer, its correlates, clinical course, and prognosis. These studies have been conducted with varying degrees of methodologic rigor. An assessment has been made of the quality of this existing evidence to identify from the best evidence the factors which predict the adjustment status of women with breast cancer. Studies have been reviewed, using methodologic standards for the critical appraisal of studies on prognosis, developed by Sackett and colleagues in the Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada). Few of the studies investigating psychosocial adjustment of women with breast cancer meet all of the criteria for reviewing studies of clinical course and prognosis. This review focuses the direction and methodologic rigor required in future investigations. In particular, studies are needed that employ prospective designs and that deliberately measure or control for the extraneous prognostic variables that may affect adjustment. Future investigations need to incorporate adequate precision in measurement so that measures of the psychosocial variables are objective, reliable, and valid. 
1	Impact of anatomical radical prostatectomy on urinary continence. Urinary continence following an anatomical approach to radical prostatectomy was evaluated in 593 consecutive patients, 547 (92%) of whom achieved complete urinary control. Stress incontinence was present in 46 patients (8%), of whom 34 (6%) wore 1 or fewer pads per day and 2 (0.3%) required placement of an artificial sphincter. No patient was totally incontinent. Age, weight of the prostate, prior transurethral resection of the prostate, pathological stage and preservation or wide excision of the neurovascular bundles had no significant influence on preservation of urinary control. These data suggest that anatomical factors rather than preservation of autonomic innervation may be responsible for the improved urinary control associated with an anatomical approach to radical prostatectomy. 
5	Surgical correction of the snapping iliopsoas tendon. Eighteen patients with 20 symptomatic hips underwent lengthening of the iliopsoas tendon for persistent painful snapping of this "internal" variety of snapping hip. We referred to the pathologic, painful snapping of the iliopsoas in the deep anterior groin as the "internal" snapping hip. This is in contrast to the more common and better-known "external" snapping that involves the greater trochanter and its overlying soft tissues. The results of our iliopsoas lengthening procedure are presented here. Lengthening of the iliopsoas tendon was accomplished by step cutting of the tendinous portion of the iliopsoas. The pathoanatomy of this poorly understood symptom complex was described in 1984 paper from this institution and is reviewed here. Iliopsoas bursography demonstrated a sudden jerking movement of the iliopsoas tendon between the anterior inferior iliac spine and iliopectineal eminence, synchronous with the patient's pain and often accompanied by an audible snap. The average preoperative duration of symptoms was 2.9 years, and the average length of postoperative followup was 25 months. All patients, except one, had a marked reduction in the frequency of snapping after tendon lengthening, and 14 of 20 hips had no snapping postoperatively. Of the six patients who had recurrence of snapping, all but one stated that this occurred much less frequently and was much less painful compared to the preoperative state. Two hips required reoperation. Postoperatively, only three patients complained of subjective weakness, and most patients were unlimited in physical activity with return to activities such as competitive football, pole vaulting, and long-distance running. 
1	Vasculitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Report of 11 cases and review of the literature. In a study of 222 patients with vasculitis, we identified 11 who had an associated neoplasia. Seven had hematological neoplasia and 4 had solid malignant tumors. In 4 patients vasculitis gave the first evidence of the neoplasia or of its recurrence. Nine of our patients had cutaneous vasculitis. The other 2 had vasculitis involving the intestine and resulted in acute abdomens. These 2 patients needed prednisone treatment for the vasculitis. Neoplasia should be considered in patients with vasculitis without an apparent cause. 
1	Multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas: treatment and follow-up. A second primary bronchogenic carcinoma subsequently developed 8 to 156 months later in 19 patients who underwent curative resection of primary bronchogenic carcinomas. The second primary tumor was treated by surgical resection in 9 patients, 3 patients' tumors were considered unresectable, and the remaining 7 patients, despite having potentially resectable tumors, did not undergo resection because of insufficient pulmonary reserve or unwillingness to undergo resection. Actuarial life-table analysis of survival for the 9 patients who underwent resection showed a median survival time of 110.3 months compared with 19 months for the group with unresected but resectable tumors and 10.5 months for the group with unresectable tumors. There was no operative mortality in the group with resected tumors. We conclude that in patients in whom a second primary carcinoma of the lung develops, surgical resection prolongs survival and can be performed with a low operative mortality. 
5	Reappraisal of surgical treatment of traumatic transection of the thoracic aorta. Since Crawford's report in 1973, repair of traumatic transection of the thoracic aorta without shunt or bypass has emerged as a popular technique which simplifies the operation and avoids use of heparin. Growing evidence, however, indicates that the incidence of paraplegia is higher with this method and may outweigh its advantages. With this in mind, we have examined our experience with 40 patients who underwent repair of aortic transection from 1975-1988. The operated patients in our series all survived. Fourteen were repaired using some type of bypass or shunt, none of whom developed paraplegia. The remaining 26 patients were repaired without a shunt and 9 (34.6%) developed paraplegia or paraparesis (p less than 0.02). Paraplegia was related to aortic occlusion time (p less than 0.002). It did not occur in 11 patients with times less than 27 minutes, but happened in 2 of 8 patients with times between 28 and 35 minutes and in all 7 patients with clamp times over 35 minutes. These data suggest that shunt or bypass should be used in most cases of aortic transection. 
2	Multipolar electrocoagulation versus injection therapy in the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers. A prospective, randomized trial. This study prospectively compares multipolar electrocoagulation and injection therapy in high-risk patients with bleeding ulcers. Patients were considered for entry if they had a bloody nasogastric aspirate, melena, or hematochezia and unstable vital signs, transfusion of greater than or equal to 2 U of blood in 12 hours, or a decrease in hematocrit of greater than or equal to 6% in 12 hours. Sixty patients with endoscopic evidence of an ulcer with active bleeding (n = 26) or a nonbleeding visible vessel (n = 34) were randomly assigned to receive multipolar electrocoagulation or injection with absolute ethanol. Hemostasis was achieved in 14 of 14 actively bleeding patients with multipolar electrocoagulation vs. 10 of 12 (83%) treated with injection. No significant differences were observed between electrocoagulation and injection therapy in any parameter assessed during the hospitalization: incidence of further bleeding (6% vs. 10%), units of blood transfused after treatment (1.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.4), incidence of surgery for bleeding (6% vs. 7%), length of hospital stay in days (5.8 +/- 0.9 vs. 7.2 +/- 2.5), cost of hospitalization (+7160 +/- +1630 vs. +8520 +/- +2960), or mortality rate (3% vs. 3%). Treatment induced bleeding in nonbleeding visible vessels in 35% of subjects in each group, but this was controlled with continued treatment in all patients. One delayed perforation occurred 9 days after multipolar electrocoagulation. Multipolar electrocoagulation and injection therapy are of comparable efficacy in the treatment of patients with clinical evidence of a major upper gastrointestinal bleed and endoscopic evidence of an ulcer with active bleeding or a nonbleeding visible vessel. 
5	Rebleeding from intracranial dissecting aneurysm in the vertebral artery. We describe two patients with rebleeding from intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms during the acute stage. One patient had excellent results after emergency surgery. A review of recent reports including 60 patients with this disorder revealed a rebleeding rate of 30%, mostly during the acute stage. This suggests that a ruptured dissecting aneurysm in the vertebral artery is at risk for rebleeding during the acute stage, similar to a saccular aneurysm in the same location. 
4	Failure of long-term digitalization to prevent rapid ventricular response in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Digitalis is frequently prescribed to patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation to reduce the ventricular rate during subsequent paroxysms. To verify the validity of this assumption, we determined the ventricular rate during paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in 13 patients receiving long-term digoxin therapy (mean plasma digoxin level + 1.28 +/- 0.4 ng/ml) and compared it with that of a group of 14 patients who had not taken digoxin or beta-adrenergic and calcium-blocking agents before the attack. The treated and the untreated groups were similar statistically. The mean ventricular rate of the digitalized patients was 121 +/- 15 beats per minute, while that of the patients in the control group was 118 +/- 16 beats per minute. It is concluded that long-term digoxin therapy is not effective in reducing the ventricular response in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation despite adequate therapeutic levels. 
5	A controlled clinical comparison of 6 and 8 months of antituberculosis chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with silicotuberculosis in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Chest Service/tuberculosis Research Centre, Madras/British Medical Research Council. Patients with silicotuberculosis have been reported to respond poorly to antituberculosis chemotherapy. Therefore, in a study in Hong Kong, 240 Chinese male patients with both silicosis and pulmonary tuberculosis were all prescribed treatment three times weekly with streptomycin, isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide, allocated at random to be given for a total duration of either 6 (M6 regimen) or 8 months (M8 regimen) in a concurrent comparison. Those with a history of previous antituberculosis chemotherapy received ethambutol as well for the first 3 months. The intake in the M6 regimen was terminated when preliminary results showed that it was inadequate, and a further 53 patients were assigned to the M8 series. Of 91 assessable patients in the concurrent comparison with susceptible strains pretreatment, 44% were culture negative at 1 month, 80% at 2 months, and 98% at 3 months, and 1 had an unfavorable bacteriologic response during chemotherapy. During 3 yr of assessment, bacteriologic relapse after chemotherapy occurred in 22% of the M6 compared with 7% of the M8 patients (p less than 0.025, log-rank test). Inadequate chemotherapy was received by 12% of the 240 patients in the concurrent comparison because of default and by 22% because of adverse effects, but by 3 yr 92% of patients with susceptible strains pretreatment in each series had a favorable status following retreatment for relapse or for initially inadequate chemotherapy when required. The results show that patients with silicosis require at least 8 months of treatment. 
5	Posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in eyes with inactive and active proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We reviewed the records of 2,100 consecutive eyes that had undergone extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation between January 1981 and December 1989. Of these eyes, 21 had inactive and four had active proliferative diabetic retinopathy at the time of cataract extraction. Twenty-one eyes with inactive proliferative diabetic retinopathy received extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, and four eyes with active proliferative diabetic retinopathy had both extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and pars plana vitrectomy with endophotocoagulation. The mean follow-up period was 27 months. Final visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 12 of 25 eyes (48%). Of 25 eyes, five (20%) showed progression of the retinopathy after the operation, and two (8%) developed macular edema. Extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was well tolerated in most eyes. 
5	A case-control study of risk factors for intraoperative suprachoroidal expulsive hemorrhage. The authors performed a case-control study of risk factors for suprachoroidal expulsive hemorrhage (SEH); the study involved 68 SEH cases at their institution from 1981 to 1986. The authors examined 113 variables in the study group and a procedure-matched control group of 217 patients randomly selected from the 35,459 patients who underwent intraocular surgery during this period, and subjected them to bivariate and conditional logistic regression analysis. The incidence of SEH was 0.19% overall, 0.16% for lens-related procedures, 0.15% for glaucoma surgery, 0.41% for retinal and vitreous procedures, and 0.56% for keratoplasty. Statistically significant risk factors for SEH in age-adjusted bivariate analyses included: glaucoma (P less than 0.0001), increased axial length (P less than 0.0001), elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) (P less than 0.0001), generalized atherosclerosis (P = 0.007), and elevated intraoperative pulse (P = 0.0001). Conditional logistic regression analysis with frequency matching on age identified significant independent risks associated with a history of glaucoma, elevated IOP, increased axial length, and intraoperative tachycardia. One of the models predicts a 752-fold increased theoretical relative risk of SEH for a patient with axial length greater than or equal to 25.8 mm, a history of glaucoma, preoperative IOP greater than 18 mmHg, and intraoperative pulse greater than or equal to 85 beats per minute. The visual outcome after SEH was best in cases of extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), compared with other procedures. Results suggest that attention to multiple preoperative and intraoperative ocular and systemic variables may allow identification and prophylaxis of patients at risk for SEH. 
4	Compensation and overcompensation in congestive heart failure. The compensatory mechanisms that develop in response to heart failure have been well defined. In this review, it is argued that each compensatory mechanism leads to overcompensation and that there is no way to distinguish between the beneficial aspects of the former and the harmful effects of the latter. Therapeutic agents that maintain rather than decrease blood pressure might perhaps be more beneficial because of the crucial role of hypotension in initiating both compensation and overcompensation. 
1	Effect of suramin on human prostate cancer cells in vitro. Suramin, a polyanionic compound with known antiparasitic activity, has been shown to be adrenocorticolytic in primates and to have clinical efficacy in the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer refractory to conventional hormonal manipulation. To better characterize the activity of suramin on prostate cancer biology, we studied the effect of the drug on plasma adrenal androgens of patients and on the human prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines PC-3, DU 145 and LNCaP-FGC. Five cancer patients treated with suramin had an approximate 40% decline in circulating androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels. The drug inhibited the colony formation in two of the three cell lines at concentrations clinically achievable in humans without excessive drug-related toxicity. The presence of suramin 300 micrograms./ml. partially inhibited the growth stimulatory effect of testosterone and basic fibroblast growth factor, but not that of epidermal growth factor. The cellular concentration of suramin following exposure to a single dose increases linearly over time in each of the cell lines with LNCaP-FGC accumulating the highest levels of the drug; cellular levels of suramin, not androgen or growth factor sensitivity, correlated with the sensitivity to the drug. The concentrations of prostatic acid phosphatase and prostatic specific antigen released by LNCaP-FGC cells in cell culture medium declined in the presence of increasing levels of suramin in a manner which exceeded the decrease in cell number. We conclude that suramin, aside from decreasing circulating androgens through its adrenocorticolytic effect, is also capable exerting a direct inhibitory effect on cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells, and interfere at a cellular level with the growth stimulatory effects of exogenous testosterone and basic fibroblast growth factor. 
2	Clinical significance of cholelithiasis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. There is general agreement that the prevalence of gallstones in cirrhotics is high (at least twice that in the general population), but the pathogenetic link between cirrhosis and cholelithiasis is still uncertain. The influence of cholelithiasis on survival in cirrhotics is also unknown. During an 8-year period, we observed 90 patients affected by decompensated cirrhosis: 36 of them (40%) turned out by cholecystographic/cholangiographic or ultrasonographic examination to have cholelithiasis. We were not able to demonstrate any correlation between cholelithiasis and sex, age of patients, etiology of cirrhosis, severity of the illness, degree of portal hypertension, previous gastrointestinal bleeding, number of pregnancies, or levels of serum cholesterol, bilirubin, and triglycerides. During the follow-up observation, (range, 1-91 months), 30 patients died. Survival curves analyzed by the log-rank test did not show any difference between patients with or without gallstones. We therefore confirm that cirrhosis is a lithogenic condition, but we were not able to explain the reasons for the close relationship between cholelithiasis and cirrhosis. Gallstones, however, did not affect the survival of these patients. 
5	Health perceptions and survival: do global evaluations of health status really predict mortality? Self-evaluations of health status have been shown to predict mortality, above and beyond the contribution to prediction made by indices based on the presence of health problems, physical disability, and biological or life-style risk factors. Several possible reasons for this association are discussed: (a) methodological shortcomings of previous studies render the association spurious; (b) other psychosocial influences on mortality are involved and explain the association; and (c) self-evaluations of health status have a direct and independent effect of their own. Four-year follow-up mortality data from the Yale Health and Aging Project (N = 2812) are used to explore these possibilities. The analysis controls for the contribution of numerous indicators of health problems, disability and risk factors, and also makes adjustments of standard errors for the complex sample design. The findings favor the third possibility, an independent effect, to the extent that the particular set of psychosocial factors examined did not explain the basic association, and to the extent that the control variables were an adequately comprehensive set. 
5	Susceptibility to thyroid autoimmune disease: molecular analysis of HLA-D region genes identifies new markers for goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hashimoto's thyroiditis has been shown to be associated with the HLA-specificities DR4 and DR5. Since former association studies yielded variable results, we used novel molecular typing methods to assess predisposing immunogenetic factors. Gene analysis of the HLA-DR-DQ and tumor necrosis factor region was performed in a group of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients and randomly chosen controls using standards and nomenclature of the 10th International Histocompatibility Workshop. Genomic DNA of patients and controls was analyzed using a cDNA probe of the DQB1 gene. The resulting restriction fragment patterns allowed the determination of newly defined DQw-types 1-9. We find the strongest relative risk conferred by DQw7 (RR = 4.7), that is observed in 36 of 64 patients (56%) and only 21 of 98 controls (21%) (P corr less than 0.002). Comparison of DNA sequence variation in the DQB1 gene, that is found predominantly in Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients, indicates that codons 45 and 57 are critical features in DQw7 which distinguish it from other DQw specificities. The adjacent DQA1 genes also display a significant association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (DQA1*0201/*0301 heterozygotes were found in 37% of patients and 15% controls, P less than 0.03). No significant association could be found with polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis factor gene. These results provide a new basis for the concept of genetic susceptibility in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and will help to elucidate the underlying autoimmune mechanisms that lead to disease at the functional level. 
4	Reoperation for persistent outflow obstruction in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This study compares results of a second left ventricular myotomy and myectomy (M + M) with those of mitral valve replacement (MVR) as reoperative procedures for persistent left ventricular outflow obstruction after M + M in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Comparison of the second M + M group (n = 12) with the MVR group (n = 11) disclosed significant difference (p less than 0.05) in mean age at the initial operation (29 +/- 11 years versus 40 +/- 8 years), interval between operations (46 +/- 57 months versus 18 +/- 13 months), and age at reoperation (33 +/- 10 years versus 42 +/- 8 years); and insignificant differences in mean preoperative functional class, cardiac index, left ventricular outflow gradients at rest or with provocation, and hospital mortality at reoperation (2/12 versus 1/11). At 6 months after reoperation, comparison of results of a second M + M with MVR showed that mean functional class, cardiac index, and left ventricular outflow gradient at rest were similarly improved, but the outflow gradient with provocation was significantly higher in the second M + M group (57 +/- 44 mm Hg versus 14 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.05). Total follow-up was 108 patient-years (100% complete) with an average of 5.9 years per patient in the second M + M group and 3.4 years per patient in the MVR group. Actuarial survival, including hospital mortality, at 3 and 5 years was 83% and 76%, respectively, after the second M + M, which was similar to 92% and 77% after MVR. 
3	Shunt nephritis. Case report. The incidence of shunt nephritis has decreased over the past several years due to the increased use of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts rather than the ventriculovascular systems for which this complication was originally reported in 1965. Despite this trend, the syndrome has been reported in cases of VP shunting and, for this reason, merit a renewed look. Shunt nephritis is thought to be secondary to immune complex formation and deposition in the kidney in response to Staphylococcus epidermidis. The diagnostic workup and management of this disease is discussed. 
1	Juvenile (embryonal and alveolar) rhabdomyosarcoma of the head and neck in adults. A clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical study of 12 cases. Sites in the head and neck region (orbit, nasopharynx, nasal cavity, etc.) are among the most frequent locations for juvenile (embryonal and alveolar) rhabdomyosarcomas in patients younger than 15 years; however, comparable neoplasms in adults are very uncommon. A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 12 juvenile rhabdomyosarcomas in patients between the ages of 18 and 36 years is presented. There was a female:male ratio of 2:1. The orbit with or without contiguous paranasal sinus involvement, nasal cavity, sphenoid sinus, middle ear, and soft tissues of the neck and preauricular region were the primary sites. Seven tumors involved a parameningeal site and eight cases were alveolar rhabdomyosarcomas which together contributed to the adverse outcome. Only two patients were long-term, disease-free survivors. Six patients have died of tumor and two others are alive with persistent disease. Immunohistochemical study in 11 cases demonstrated reactivity for vimentin and muscle-specific actin (HHF-35) and desmin in ten cases. Juvenile rhabdomyosarcoma rarely presents in the head and neck of adults but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a small cell neoplasm in patients during the third and fourth decades of life. 
3	Deformities of the hip in adults who have sickle-cell disease and had avascular necrosis in childhood. A natural history of fifty-two patients. We report the natural course of the hip in fifty-two patients (ninety-five hips) who had sickle-cell disease and had had avascular necrosis in childhood. There were twenty-one African, twenty-one West Indian, and ten Mediterranean patients. At the most recent follow-up examination (at an average duration of nineteen years after the onset of the disease), 80 per cent of the hips that had been affected by avascular necrosis during childhood were painful and had permanent damage with regard to decreased mobility, limb-length discrepancy, and an abnormal gait. When the patients were evaluated, at an average age of thirty-one years, fifteen hips (16 per cent) had had an operation for progressive disability and sixty (63 per cent) had major problems because of pain. Of the twenty hips (21 per cent) that were not painful, five were in patients who had an abnormal gait, with decreased agility. The mean Iowa hip-rating score at the most recent follow-up examination was 73 points (range, 30 to 100 points). Correlations were found between the hip score and the patient's age at the onset of the disease and at the latest follow-up, between the hip score and degenerative changes in the hip, and between degenerative changes and radiographic evidence of deformity of the hip. 
5	Buffered versus plain lidocaine as a local anesthetic for simple laceration repair. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Buffered lidocaine was compared with plain lidocaine as a local anesthetic for simple lacerations. DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind, prospective clinical trial. SETTING: Urban emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-one adult patients with simple linear lacerations were enrolled. Patients with allergy to lidocaine and patients with an abnormal mental status were excluded. INTERVENTIONS: Each wound edge was anesthetized with either plain or buffered lidocaine using a randomized, double-blind protocol. The pain of infiltration was measured with a previously validated visual analog pain scale. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Analysis of pooled data and paired data (using patients as their own controls) revealed that infiltrating buffered lidocaine was significantly less painful than plain lidocaine (P = .03 and P = .02, respectively). There was no significant difference in the anesthetic effectiveness of the two agents during suturing. CONCLUSION: Buffered lidocaine is preferable to plain lidocaine as a local anesthetic agent for the repair of simple lacerations. 
4	A manifesting carrier of Duchenne muscular dystrophy with severe myocardial symptoms. A 42-year-old so-called manifesting carrier of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), whose first complaints were severe myocardial symptoms, is described. Immunohistochemical study using anti-dystrophin anti-serum and analysis of cloned segments of X chromosome DNA were performed. Her two sons and one of her brothers appear to have had the same disease. She was admitted to the hospital complaining of dyspnoea, back pain and palpitations and was first diagnosed as having myocardial infarction. However, this diagnosis was excluded. The echocardiogram showed diffuse abnormalities of myocardial function. Serum enzymes were increased. Minimal weakness and decreased deep tendon reflexes were detected in her left lower extremity. Muscle biopsy revealed a small number of necrotic fibres. Immunohistochemical study using anti-dystrophin antiserum showed a mosaic pattern of the surface membrane. Analysis of cloned segments of X chromosome DNA from the patient and her son showed the XmnI(Asp) alleles of pERT 87-15 and the TaqI alleles of pERT 87-8 in both patients. 
4	Arterial switch procedure in an adult. The arterial switch procedure has been shown to offer both anatomic and physiologic correction in infants and children with transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect. We believe that adults may also benefit in some circumstances, as evidenced by the case of a 22-year-old man who underwent successful operation after having initially undergone pulmonary artery banding for transposition with ventricular septal defect in 1967 when he was 5 months of age. 
2	Redevelopment of hepatitis B surface antigen after renal transplantation. A patient with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic renal failure received a renal transplantation. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) disappeared, and antibodies to HBsAg appeared 10 months before transplantation. Liver tests showed no abnormality at transplantation. Six months later, chronic hepatitis reactivated, antibodies to HBsAg disappeared, and HBsAg reappeared. Hepatitis B virus DNA was demonstrated with polymerase chain reaction in the serum collected before transplantation. This observation suggests that low level HBV replication was present before transplantation despite the absence of detectable HBsAg and was reactivated under immunosuppressive therapy after transplantation. 
1	The value of radioimmunoguided surgery in first and second look laparotomy for colorectal cancer. Radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) using an anti-CEA (A5B7) monoclonal antibody has been assessed in 52 patients (43 primary excisions and nine second look procedures) undergoing surgery for colorectal carcinoma. The antibody localized in 97.8 percent of primary tumours and in 88.8 percent of the principal tumor in second look procedures. Additional information concerning the extent of primary tumor was obtained in 11 of 43 patients (25.5 percent) undergoing excision of primary carcinoma and five of nine patients (55 percent) in the second look series. Incorrect information was obtained about the extent of the primary tumour in six patients (11.3 percent), whereas no incorrect information was obtained during second look procedures. RIGS correctly predicted the subsequent Dukes' staging in 77 percent of first look cases (sensitivity 65 percent, specificity 90 percent), although accurate identification of individual nodes was impossible. The technique influenced the surgical procedure performed in 2 of 43 cases (4.6 percent) in primary surgery and in three of nine patients undergoing second look laparotomy (33 percent). RIGS in primary colorectal carcinoma may provide additional information concerning extent of locally advanced tumors in particular and the principle that the subsequent surgery may be influenced has been established. The technique appears to have a greater role in second look procedures where it may help determine the extent of recurrent tumour. Larger follow-up series are required to define how the additional information provided by this technique may best be exploited. 
5	Multiple gunshot wounds of the head: an anthropological view. A decomposed body was judged at the scene to have two gunshot wounds of the thorax and three of the head. Confirmed at autopsy, the condition of the remains precluded conclusions about the precise nature of the defects. Preparation and reconstruction of the skull disclosed seven large cranial defects and a series of fractures. This preparation allowed the application of well-known principles of gunshot wound analysis. Although the analysis of specific gunshot wound defects is well covered in the literature, there are few examples of the application of gunshot wound principles to complex wound cases. Three entrances and three exits were identified. A seventh defect resulted from bullet passage. Finally, the wounds were sequenced. 
1	Preventing colorectal cancer. Knowledgeable patients should not die of colorectal cancer. Increasing the intake of dietary fiber, decreasing fat consumption, and increasing the use of modern technology to detect adenomatous polyps and early cancer can greatly decrease the mortality associated with colorectal cancer. 
2	Management of dysphagia in suspected esophageal motor disorders Fifty-three patients suffering from dysphagia because of suspected esophageal motor disorders were treated by pneumatic dilatation using the Rider-Moeller technique. Fifteen had achalasia demonstrated by manometric studies. Forty-nine of them had remarkable clinical improvement after the procedure. During the mean period of follow-up (average 5 years, range 1-11), 75% of the patients needed a new dilatation, with a delay of two years. The results of the dilatation were excellent or good in 80% of the cases. Early complications consisted in two esophageal perforations surgically treated. There was no mortality. We did not observe late complications of the procedure. We conclude that pneumatic dilatation should be the initial procedure in the treatment of dysphagia in suspected esophageal motor disorders. 
4	Coronary atherosclerosis is associated with left ventricular dysfunction and dilatation in aortic stenosis. Patients with aortic stenosis develop widely variable patterns of left ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction. We postulated that coronary atherosclerosis (CAD) may be associated with impaired left ventricular function and chamber dilatation in patients with aortic stenosis. Left ventricular mass and volumes were quantified from two-dimensional echocardiography and correlated with coronary angiography in 78 patients with severe aortic stenosis and no previous myocardial infarction or regional wall motion abnormalities. Eighteen patients (group 1) had smooth coronary arteries, 25 patients had irregular coronary arteries with 50% or less stenosis (group 2), and 35 patients had obstructive CAD (group 3). Even though the calculated valve area was similar in all three study groups, group 1 patients had higher values for ejection fraction (65 +/- 9%, 51 +/- 17%, and 48 +/- 13%; p = 0.0002), systolic mass-to-volume ratio (9.2 +/- 3.9, 5.6 +/- 2.8, and 5.2 +/- 2.2; p = 0.0001), and cardiac index (2.9 +/- 0.7, 2.5 +/- 0.7, and 2.3 +/- 0.6 l/min.min2; p = 0.015) than patients in groups 2 and 3, respectively (mean +/- SD). Mean circumferential wall stress was inversely related to severity of CAD. Multivariate analysis showed that CAD is an independent predictor of ejection fraction and mass-to-volume ratio in this group of patients. Thus, in an elderly population with severe aortic stenosis, patients with both obstructive and nonobstructive CAD have an increased incidence of left ventricular enlargement and systolic dysfunction. 
1	A standard dose of radiation for "microscopic disease" is not appropriate. Elective irradiation of sites of potential occult tumor spread is often part of a patient's radiation therapy program. The required radiation dose (D) depends on the probability that occult disease exists (P(occ)), the number of sites at risk (A), the number of tumor clonogens present (Ni), their radiation sensitivity, and the desired control rate. An exponential model of cell survival is used to quantify the importance of these factors. Control Probability = [1 - Pocc x (1 - e-Ni x (SF2)D/2)]A; SF2 = surviving fraction after 2 Gy. Implications for clinical radiation therapy include: 1. Since the number of clonogens in an occult site may vary from 10 degrees to 10(8), Ni is the major determinant of the required dose. The intrinsic radiation sensitivity of the clonogens (SF2) is also extremely important in determining the dose. Other factors are less influential since they vary less. 2. The variability of Ni (8 logs) is larger than the variation in cell number seen with gross disease (1 cm3 versus 1000 cm3, 3 logs). When Ni approximately 10(8), the required dose approaches that needed for small volume gross disease (10(9) cells, 1 cm3). 3. The dose prescribed to elective sites should reflect the risk of occult disease based on the primary tumor site, stage, and grade. 4. Regions where clinicoradiologic evaluation is difficult (e.g., pelvis and obese neck) require higher doses because macroscopic tumor deposits may exist. 5. Relatively low doses (10 to 30 Gy) are often thought to be inadequate for microscopic tumor. However, similar doses have been reported to sterilize microscopic tumor in ovarian, rectal, bladder, breast, and head and neck carcinomas. Relatively low doses should not be discounted since they may be useful in select cases when normal tissue tolerances and/or previous irradiation treatment limit the radiation dose. 
5	Monitoring platelet interactions with prosthetic graft implants in a canine model. This study shows that prosthetic arterial grafts stimulate platelets for as long as 1 year after implantation in a canine model. Carotid-to-distal aorta Dacron (DuPont, Wilmington, DE) grafts (0.8 x 50.0 cm) were tunneled subcutaneously over the right dorsal side, allowing for percutaneous arterial sampling. Thromboxane B2 (TxB2) levels were evaluated at the proximal anastomosis (w), 5.0 (x), 25.0 (y), and 50.0 (z) cm distal from w, and platelet counts and mean platelet volumes were monitored at sites w and z. TxB2 levels increased after blood entered the graft and progressively increased until the blood exited at the distal anastomosis. Platelet counts did not significantly change across the graft. Over time, systemic platelet counts decreased to approximately 50% of each dog's pregraft baseline levels and remained depressed over a 1 year period. Mean platelet volumes peaked 1-3 weeks after implant and remained greater than pregraft levels. Examination of the graft luminal surface showed a developed pseudointima characteristically similar to that which develops in mature human vascular grafts. These results suggest that healed vascular grafts in canines continue to stimulate platelet release of TxB2, reduce systemic platelet counts, and increase mean platelet volumes over 1 year. These data further suggest that platelets are stimulated by the graft and consumed. 
5	Corticotropin-releasing factor modulates the immune response to stress in the rat. We examined the role of CRF, a key mediator of the endocrine response to stress, in modulating immunosuppression during the subacute stress of intermittent electrical shock over 1 h. Administration of shock to intact rats resulted in a 74% decrement in T-lymphocyte proliferation and a 59% decrease in natural killer cytotoxicity. Similar suppression of these two parameters of immune function in response to shock was noted in adrenalectomized rats as well. The immunosuppressive effects of this shock were significantly and comparably blunted when both intact and adrenalectomized animals were pretreated 1) iv with either a highly potent polyclonal CRF antibody or a specific CRF antagonist or 2) intracerebroventricularly with either a high affinity monoclonal antibody to CRF or a specific CRF antagonist. An immunomodulatory role for CRF is further supported by the findings that administration of exogenous CRF, either iv (10 micrograms/animal) or intracerebroventricularly (1 microgram/animal), resulted in significant decrements in lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cytotoxicity, similar to those seen with the stress paradigm. Our observations indicate that CRF plays a significant role in modulating the immune response to subacute stress, largely by adrenal-independent mechanisms. 
1	Cutaneous melanoma and bilateral retinoblastoma. We report the case of an otherwise healthy 37-year-old man who had had bilateral enucleation during early childhood for bilateral retinoblastomas, in addition to two cutaneous melanomas (the first appearing at age 27 years). He also had dysplastic melanocytic nevi and a history of cutaneous melanoma in his mother. Retinoblastoma may aggregate in families and is associated with DNA abnormalities of chromosome 13. Recent reports have emphasized the appearance of second malignancies in retinoblastoma survivors. The second malignancies include osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, and cutaneous melanoma. Cutaneous melanoma also may aggregate in families, usually in the setting of dysplastic melanocytic nevi. The features of this case and of similar reported cases suggest that there may be a greater than expected association between retinoblastoma and cutaneous melanoma. 
4	Multivariate analysis in the prediction of death in hospital after acute myocardial infarction. Prognostic factors in patients with acute myocardial infarction based on clinical and investigative data on admission were evaluated prospectively in 111 consecutive patients. Seventeen patients (15.3%) died during hospital stay. Age, a previous infarct, high Killip class, cardiomegaly, high serum concentrations of cardiac enzymes, a low ejection fraction, and a high wall motion score index correlated significantly with in-hospital mortality; whereas sex, risk factors, and pericardial effusion did not. Multivariate analysis showed that age and the wall motion score index were the best predictors of death in hospital. Wall motion detected by cross sectional echocardiography may reflect the extent of myocardial involvement. Age and wall motion score index predicted in-hospital mortality with a sensitivity of 76.5%, a specificity of 91.5%, and a predictive accuracy of 89.2%. Age and the wall motion score index can be determined on admission and are useful for identifying patients at high risk of cardiac death who might benefit from early intervention. 
5	Increased ischemic injury but decreased hypoxic injury in hypertrophied rat hearts. The purpose of this study was to compare the degree of ischemic and hypoxic injury in normal versus hypertrophied rat hearts to investigate basic mechanisms responsible for irreversible myocardial ischemic injury. Hearts from rats with bands placed on the aortic arch at 23 days of age (BAND) and sham-operated rats (SHAM, 8 weeks postoperative) were isolated, perfused with Krebs buffer, and had a left ventricular balloon to measure developed pressure. Hearts were made globally ischemic until they developed peak ischemic contracture and were reperfused for 30 minutes. Additional hearts were perfused for 15 minutes with glucose-free hypoxic buffer followed by 20 minutes of oxygenated perfusion. There was an 87% increase in heart weight of BAND compared with SHAM (p less than 0.01). During ischemia, lactate levels increased faster in BAND compared with SHAM, ischemic contracture occurred earlier in BAND than in SHAM despite no difference in ATP levels, and postischemic recovery of left ventricular pressure was less in BAND (26.8 +/- 5.6% of control left ventricular pressure, mean +/- SEM) compared with SHAM (40 +/- 4.6%, p less than 0.05). During hypoxic perfusion, lactate release was greater in BAND than in SHAM (48.8 +/- 1.2 versus 26.6 +/- 0.97 mumols/g, p less than 0.01), and with reoxygenation, lactate dehydrogenase release was less in BAND than in SHAM (13.2 +/- 0.7 versus 19.5 +/- 0.2 IU/g, p less than 0.01). After hypoxia and reoxygenation, left ventricular pressure recovery was greater in BAND than in SHAM (93 +/- 8.4% versus 66 +/- 5.3%, p less than 0.01). Thus, this study suggests that hypertrophied hearts have a greater potential for glycolytic metabolism, resulting in an increased rate of by-product accumulation during ischemia, which may be responsible for the increased susceptibility of hypertrophied hearts to ischemic injury. 
5	Management of arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the forearm. We initially observed our patient, who had subcutaneous arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the volar forearm, until his wound demarcation was complete. After wound demarcation, we proceeded with debridement and partial-thickness skin grafting. Upper extremity function was totally normal 3 months after this therapy. This is the first case report in the literature that describes a child with an arginine monohydrochloride-induced extravasation necrosis. 
3	The painful shoulder: Part II. Intrinsic disorders and impingement syndrome. Intrinsic disorders that can cause shoulder pain include arthritis, gout, pseudogout and osteonecrosis. In its mildest form, impingement syndrome may cause only minimal discomfort. At its worst, impingement syndrome may lead to rotator cuff tear. Bicipital tendinitis and rupture of the biceps tendon may also be associated with impingement. Early rehabilitative intervention is important. Physical therapy is directed toward restoring range of motion and muscle strength. 
5	Abdominal wall considerations and complications in reoperative surgery. The abdominal wall is the source of significant problems for patients undergoing multiple abdominal operations. The orientation of sequential incisions must be carefully considered to avoid compromise of the abdominal wall blood supply, which may result in either acute (dehiscence) or delayed (ventral hernia) complications. Infections are the most serious problems of the multiply operated on abdominal wall. These complications may range from simple wound infection to necrotizing fasciitis. Management may require only simple drainage of the infection or may entail extensive debridement for the necrotizing processes. Regardless of the cause, the multiply operated on abdominal wall may require reconstruction because of lost fascia. Polypropylene mesh can be employed safely and effectively for this purpose. 
1	Proliferation and DNA ploidy in malignant breast tumors in relation to early oral contraceptive use and early abortions. In 175 premenopausal breast cancer patients, a history of oral contraceptive (OC) use before 20 years of age was significantly associated with higher tumor cell proliferative activity, as indicated by a higher S-phase fraction (SPF), and a higher fraction of DNA aneuploid tumors, compared with later or never users (P = 0.05 and p = 0.01, respectively). The higher SPF among early OC users was apparent in patients with aneuploid tumors but not in patients with euploid tumors. Abortions (spontaneous or induced) before the first full-term pregnancy also were associated with a higher SPF compared with other young patients with breast cancer (P = 0.03). Adjusting for parity and abortions or OC use, respectively, an early OC use was associated with a 43% higher SPF and early abortions were associated with 49% higher SPF. Younger patients had a higher SPF and a higher frequency of aneuploid tumors, but this was found to be because the users of OC had a lower median age at diagnosis. Among never users, no significant age relationship was seen for SPF or the frequency of aneuploidy. For the DNA analyses there is a selection of patients with breast cancer with larger tumors, and therefore the conclusions drawn in this article may not be generalizable to patients with smaller primary tumors, e.g., cases diagnosed at breast cancer screening. The higher tumor proliferative activity and frequency of aneuploidy in early OC users are in line with previously reported findings of worse prognostic indicators and a worse survival in early users of OC compared with other young women with breast cancer. 
1	Surgical wound infection and cancer among the elderly: a case control study. Surgical wound infection occurs in fewer than 5% of operations. Nevertheless, it represents the second most common type of hospital-acquired infection and results in increased morbidity and mortality. As with all nosocomial infections, the rate of surgical wound infection increases with age. Patients over 65 years of age run an approximately 15% risk of surgical wound infection. Two-thirds of patients with invasive cancer other than non-melanotic skin cancer are aged 65 years and over. Over half of them are treated surgically for their cancer. Cancer and other chronic diseases have been cited as possible causes of the increased risk of nosocomial infection among the elderly. Using the Foothills Hospital Wound Study Data Base as the sampling frame, we conducted a case-control study of surgical wound infection and cancer among the elderly. Cancer was found not to be a risk factor for surgical wound infection. The results are discussed in relation to the role of immunity in both disorders. 
4	Coronary artery bypass grafting in elderly patients. Comparative results in a consecutive series of 469 patients older than 75 years. A consecutive series of 7104 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting during an 18-year period (1971 to 1988) included 469 patients older than 75 years. Results were analyzed to determine comparative risk factors for morbidity, early and late survival, and functional outcome. Patients younger than 75 years (group I) and patients older than 75 years (group II) were identical for ejection fraction and standard hemodynamic indices. Mean number of grafts and crossclamp time were greater for group II patients (p less than 0.01). Mean age of group I was 58.6 years and group II, 77.6 years (p less than 0.01). Women composed 19.7% (1308/6635) of group I and 36.2% (170/469) of group II patients (p less than 0.05). Mammary grafts were placed in 57.7% (3830/6635) of group I and 41.6% (195/469) of group II patients (p less than 0.05). Overall perioperative mortality rate was 2.1% for group I and 6.8% for group II (p less than 0.05). Perioperative myocardial infarction rate was similar for the two groups. Ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias, renal insufficiency, neurologic complications, prolonged ventilatory support, increased hospital cost, and prolonged hospitalization were significantly more prevalent (all p less than 0.05) in patients older than 75 years. Five and 10 years postoperatively, there were no significant differences between groups I and II with regard to event-free status including angina, myocardial infarction, and reoperation. The 5-year survival rate was 92% for group I and 80% for group II (p less than 0.05), similar to that of age-matched control subjects. The significantly increased potential for complications and expense of coronary bypass in patients over 75 years of age mandates judicious patient selection and preoperative counseling. Despite a significantly increased early mortality and an anticipated decreased long-term survival paralleling normal life table survival curves, good intermediate functional improvement can be realized in patients older than 75 years, comparable with that expected in a much younger age group. 
2	Witzel pneumatic dilation for achalasia: safety and long-term efficacy Forceful dilation of the lower esophageal sphincter is considered primary therapy for achalasia. The Witzel pneumatic balloon dilator, unlike fluoroscopically placed dilators, is placed over a standard gastroscope allowing positioning and dilation under direct vision. We report our experience with the Witzel dilator in 45 patients with achalasia over a 5-year period. All patients had at least one major symptom score of 8 out of 10 for dysphagia and/or regurgitation before dilation. After Witzel dilation, symptomatic response was graded as excellent (score 0 to 2), good (score 3 to 5), fair (score 6 to 8), and poor (no improvement). Symptom response was assessed after 1 week, 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, and present. The mean period of follow-up was 25 months (range, 3 to 85 months). Passage of the balloon across the gastroesophageal junction was technically unsuccessful in three patients. Esophageal perforation occurred in two patients (4%) and transient chest pain greater than 2 days in three patients (7%). There was no bleeding or death. Symptomatic long-term improvement was excellent in 25 patients (63%), good in 6 patients (15%), fair in 4 patients (10%), and poor in 5 patients (12%). A repeat Witzel dilation was performed in five patients but resulted in good/excellent improvement in only one patient. We conclude that pneumatic dilation with the Witzel balloon is a safe, effective procedure for achalasia. 
5	Effects of altering the eicosanoid precursor pool on neovascularization and inflammation in the alkali-burned rabbit cornea. The effects of altering the eicosanoid precursor pool on several aspects of the nonimmunologically mediated inflammatory and angiogenic processes that follow 1N and 4N NaOH alkali burning of the rabbit cornea were compared with controls. Diets were supplemented with several dosages of oils containing either gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) (borage oil), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) (sardine oil), or a combination of the two in a dose-response protocol. Significant changes in serum fatty acid composition were demonstrated. Gamma-linolenic acid proved consistently superior to EPA in modulating the neovascular response judged by three neovascular indices. At 14 days, GLA significantly reduced the polymorphonuclear leukocyte and macrophage inflammatory infiltrate and EPA reduced the macrophage component, both with high dose; EPA also reduced keratocyte proliferation. Wound-healing parameters were unaffected. Evidence for GLA-EPA synergism was modest. Prolonged neovascular responses and chronic inflammation occurring in the clinically relevant context of severe structural damage can be modulated by nutritional alteration of the eicosanoid precursor pool. 
1	HLA class II antigens and DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism in myasthenia gravis in Japan. Human leukocyte phenotypes and genes in the HLA class II regions were studied in 46 Japanese patients with myasthenia gravis. When the HLA phenotypes of the patients with myasthenia gravis were compared with the controls, an increased frequency of HLA-DRw53 was observed in females less than 30 years of age. The genomic DNAs of the HLA-DRw53-positive patients and DRw53-positive controls were analyzed by using four complementary DNA probes for HLA class II genes. With DQB complementary DNA as the probe, a higher incidence of the 6.5-kb or 8.2-kb BamHI fragment was observed in the patients (76.0%) compared with the controls (19.0%). In contrast, no significant difference was observed between patients and controls when complementary DNAs for DRB, DQA, and DPB were used as probes. These results indicate that the genetic background of Japanese females with early-onset myasthenia gravis is different from other patients with myasthenia gravis, and that DQB genes can greatly influence the onset of myasthenia gravis. 
5	Rationalisation of follow-up in patients with non-invasive bladder tumours. A preliminary report. The risk of recurrence and progression in 170 patients presenting with pTa urothelial tumours of the bladder has been estimated so that follow-up can be rationalised. Patients were followed up for between 1 and 15 years, the original pathology reviewed and those with carcinoma in situ (CIS) or dysplasia of the background urothelium excluded. Only 5 patients progressed over the whole follow-up period, giving an overall progression rate of 3%. Solitary tumours had an annual initial recurrence risk (AIR) of 0.23 in the first year; after the first year the AIR fell to approximately 0.1 but did not fall significantly in subsequent years up to 8 years. Of the 45 patients with multiple tumours, 32 suffered recurrences within the first year (AIR 0.71). Tumour grade did not influence either recurrence or progression. The results indicate that for solitary pTa tumours, less frequent endoscopic follow-up is justified but some continued surveillance after 5 disease-free years is necessary. The estimated risk of recurrence is a useful factor to consider when planning follow-up. 
3	Neonatal facial and cry responses to invasive and non-invasive procedures. Evaluation of pain in neonates is difficult due to their limited means of communication. The aim was to determine whether behavioural reactions of cry and facial activity provoked by an invasive procedure could be discriminated from responses to non-invasive tactile events. Thirty-six healthy full-term infants (mean age 2.2 h) received 3 procedures in counterbalanced order: intramuscular injection, application of triple dye to the umbilical stub, and rubbing thigh with alcohol. Significant effects of procedure were found for total face activity and latency to face movement. A cluster of facial actions comprised of brow bulging, eyes squeezed shut, deepening of the naso-labial furrow and open mouth was associated most frequently with the invasive procedure. Comparisons between the 2 non-invasive procedures showed more facial activity to thigh swabbing and least to application of triple dye to the umbilical cord. Acoustic analysis of cry showed statistically significant differences across procedures only for latency to cry and cry duration for the group as a whole. However, babies who cried to two procedures showed higher pitch and greater intensity to the injection. There were no significant differences in melody, dysphonation, or jitter. Methodological difficulties for investigators in this area were examined, including criteria for the selection of cries for analysis, and the logical and statistical challenges of contrasting cries induced by different conditions when some babies do not always cry. It was concluded that facial expression, in combination with short latency to onset of cry and long duration of first cry cycle typifies reaction to acute invasive procedures. 
1	Obesity and colorectal adenomatous polyps. Obesity has been investigated as a risk factor for various malignancies, including colon cancer. A case-control study was conducted on patients in three colonoscopy practices in New York City to determine possible risk factors for colorectal adenomatous polyps, a known precursor lesion for most cases of colorectal cancer. Among 301 case subjects with incidence adenomatous polyps (174 men and 127 women) and 506 control subjects (223 men and 283 women), an increased risk was observed with increasing body mass index in women (odds ratio 2.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.0; for highest versus lowest quartile, linear trend P = .02). A nonsignificant trend was observed for men. The increased risk seen in women is consistent with prior observations regarding reproductive hormonal and dietary risk factors for colorectal cancer. 
1	Intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. An unusual complication of a Hickman catheter. Venous access devices (VAD) have become an important tool in the management of patients with cancer. Multiple complications can occur as a consequence of insertion of a VAD. The authors report a case of a Hickman catheter perforating the wall of the superior vena cava into the pericardium, resulting in accidental intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias developed, but the patient did not have cardiac tamponade. She recovered from the event without apparent chronic cardiac dysfunction. 
4	Heart rate adjustment of exercise-induced ST segment depression. Improved risk stratification in the Framingham Offspring Study BACKGROUND. Simple heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression during exercise (delta ST/HR index) and the pattern of ST depression as a function of heart rate during exercise and recovery (the rate-recovery loop) have been shown to improve the ability of the exercise electrocardiogram to detect the presence of coronary heart disease (CHD), but the performance of these methods for the prediction of future coronary events remains to be examined. METHODS AND RESULTS. We compared the delta ST/HR index and the rate-recovery loop with standard electrocardiographic criteria for prediction of CHD events in 3,168 asymptomatic men and women in the Framingham Offspring Study who underwent treadmill exercise electrocardiography and who, at entry, were free of clinical and electrocardiographic evidence of CHD. After a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, there were 65 new CHD events: four sudden deaths, 24 new myocardial infarctions, and 37 incident cases of angina pectoris. When a Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment for age and sex was used, a positive exercise electrocardiogram by standard criteria (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression) was not predictive of new CHD events (chi 2 = 0.40, p = 0.52). In contrast, stratification according to the presence or absence of a positive delta ST/HR index (greater than or equal to 1.6 microV/beat/min) and a positive (counterclockwise) rate-recovery loop was associated with CHD event risk (chi 2 = 9.45, p less than 0.01) and separated subjects into three groups with varying risks of coronary events: high risk, when both tests were positive (relative risk 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-5.4); intermediate risk, when either the delta ST/HR index or the rate-recovery loop was positive (relative risk, 1.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.8); and low risk, when both tests were negative. After multivariate adjustment for age, sex, smoking, total cholesterol level, fasting glucose level, diastolic blood pressure, and electrocardiographic evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, the combined delta ST/HR index and rate-recovery loop criteria remained predictive of coronary events (chi 2 = 5.45, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS. Heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression by the delta ST/HR index and the rate-recovery loop during exercise electrocardiography can improve prediction of future coronary events in asymptomatic men and women. 
1	DNA analysis of neoplasia: an introduction for the family physician. Pathologic evaluation of a neoplastic process has traditionally consisted of microscopic examination of a stained section of tissue. Although this method is generally reliable when performed by an experienced pathologist, the morphologic features of a lesion may not consistently predict biologic behavior. The DNA content of tumors can be studied with a flow cytometer to help determine the prognosis and risk of tumor recurrence. DNA analysis of a neoplasm may provide the clinician with important prognostic information and, at some future date, may help direct chemotherapy or other treatment protocols. 
4	Increased whole blood viscosity combined with decreased erythrocyte fluidity in untreated patients with essential hypertension. Erythrocyte fluidity and other haemorheological variables were studied in 22 patients with essential hypertension and compared with age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Hypertensive patients displayed a significantly lower erythrocyte fluidity (P less than 0.001). Similarly, significantly elevated values for haematocrit, plasma and whole blood viscosity, as well as aggregation tendency were observed compared to controls. Although differing in these respects from controls, there were no obvious relationships between these rheological variables and either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The significantly lower erythrocyte fluidity and other changes in haemorheological variables of red blood cells found in hypertensive patients may be explained by an enlarged metabolic pool of free calcium ions in these red blood cells. It is suggested that the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of essential hypertension are multifactorial rather than being based on a single molecular derangement. Primary events resulting in altered physicochemical properties of the red blood cells may work in concert in the development of essential hypertension, in addition to the increased availability of calcium ions and their potential role in smooth muscle contraction. 
5	Double-blind randomized trial of perioperative fibrinolytic enhancement for femoropopliteal bypass. Patients with rest pain or acute peripheral arterial thrombosis are known to have impaired endogenous fibrinolysis, which is associated with an increased risk of early vascular graft thrombosis. This risk is exacerbated by the fibrinolytic shutdown which is known to occur after major surgery. Stanozolol, which has been demonstrated to enhance endogenous fibrinolysis, was therefore used in an attempt to prevent this perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown and so enhance graft patency. Twenty-seven patients were randomized to receive either 50 mg stanozolol or placebo intramuscularly 24 h before operation, followed by a 6 week course of either 5 mg stanozolol or placebo orally, twice daily. On the second day after operation, 10-11 MBq of autologous 111indium-labelled platelets were injected, with scanning over the graft on the 3 following days. Despite using a large depot of stanozolol, significant effects, such as raised plasminogen (P less than 0.001), reduced fibrinogen (P less than 0.001) and reduced euglobulin lysis time (P less than 0.001), were not seen until the seventh day after operation, with maximum benefit at 6 weeks. This was reflected in the 111indium-labelled platelet deposition studies. The placebo group had a progressive increase in platelet deposition on all 3 days. In contrast, those receiving stanozolol showed a lower, static picture of deposition. However, these changes did not attain statistical significance. Three patients experienced early graft thrombosis, two in the placebo group and one in the stanozolol group. Only an incomplete inhibition of the perioperative fibrinolytic shutdown was achieved. Much longer preoperative courses are thus required to allow the maximum effect to be present at the most crucial time. At present, perioperative fibrinolytic enhancement does not appear to be a practical proposition, and we must await the development of new safer and more potent agents. 
1	Prostate specific antigen for assessing response to ketoconazole and prednisone in patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer. Serial prostate specific antigen levels were assessed in 15 patients with hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer treated with ketoconazole and prednisone. Of the men 12 (80%) with continually increasing prostate specific antigen levels before treatment had a decrease in prostate specific antigen with a median duration of response of 3 months. Three patients (20%) had a prolonged response (greater than or equal to 8 months) as seen by a persistently decreasing prostate specific antigen and improvement in bone pain. There appears to be a small subgroup of patients with progressive prostate cancer despite androgen ablation who will benefit from ketoconazole and glucocorticoid treatment. The use of serial prostate specific antigen levels appears to help define this subgroup and avoid the need for multiple radiological procedures to assess response. 
5	Significance of U wave polarity in patients with a prior inferior myocardial infarction. Sixty consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography and left ventriculography from six to eight weeks after the onset of definite inferior myocardial infarction were divided into three groups according to the polarity of U waves in (1) leads II, III, a VF and (2) in leads V4 to V6 (positive = Group P, flat or isoelectric = Group F, and negative = Group N). The following parameters were analyzed: (1) ECG score; (2) global ejection fraction: (3) regional area change: (4) number of asynergic, and akinetic segmental radii; (5) number of asynergic and akinetic areas: and (6) number of diseased coronary arteries and the incidence of left anterior descending artery (LAD) disease. There were no significant differences among the three groups according to the polarity of U waves in two subgroups by the site of U waves in age, gender, systemic blood pressure, and ECG scores. The polarity of U waves in leads II.III.a VF (subgroup 1) correlated with the size of myocardial infarction; regional area changes in inferior segment (Area 2) were 64.1 +/- 8.2 in group P1, 31.8 +/- 14.7 in group F1, and 21.0 +/- 15.8 in group N1 (p less than 0.01, F = 32.8). The polarity of U waves in leads V4-6 (subgroup2) correlated with anterolateral wall motion; regional area changes in anterolateral segments (Area 5) were 76.8 +/- 11.6 in group P, 66.5 +/- 18.5 in group F, and 48.9 +/- 17.1 in group N (p less than 0.01, F = 18.6). The incidence of multivessel disease increased from group P2 (36.4%), to group F2 (54.5%), to group N2 (75.0%), and the incidence of LAD disease increased from 27.3%, to 45.5%, to 68.8%, respectively. A negative U wave in either location suggested severely decreased apical wall motion, and there was a tendency for global ejection fractions to decrease in the following order: group P, group F, and group N. From these results, the authors conclude that the polarity of U waves may be one of the parameters correlating with the wall motion and left ventricular function in prior inferior myocardial infarction. 
2	Malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction managed by subtotal/total colectomy. Of 60 patients presenting with acute obstructing carcinoma of the left colon, 49 underwent immediate resection either by radical subtotal/total colectomy (31 patients, group I) or by radical segmental resection (18 patients, group II) of whom three had immediate anastomosis after on-table bowel irrigation and 15 had a planned staged procedure. The operative mortality rate was 3 per cent in group I and 11 per cent in group II (not a statistically significant difference). However, substantial differences were found for major morbidity (6 versus 44 per cent in groups I and II respectively; P less than 0.01) and mean length of hospital stay (17 days in group I versus 35 days in group II; P less than 0.05). All three patients who had on-table lavage developed anastomotic leaks which necessitated a second operation to form a stoma. Six patients (19 per cent) in group I required antidiarrhoeal medication in the immediate postoperative period. However, subsequent improvement in stool frequency was noted in all patients. It is concluded that subtotal/total colectomy is an acceptable means of managing patients with obstructing carcinoma of the left colon in that it is associated with a low morbidity and mortality rate and good functional results. 
5	Congenital chyloperitoneum as a cause of isolated fetal ascites. Isolated fetal ascites is an unusual prenatal finding and must be differentiated from immune and nonimmune hydrops. This entity is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal and genitourinary anomalies. Fetal chyloperitoneum, however, should be considered as a possible cause. Pulmonary hypoplasia and abdominal dystocia during attempted vaginal delivery are potential complications. We present a case of isolated fetal ascites due to congenital chyloperitoneum. 
4	Changes in diastolic cardiac function in developing and stable perinephritic hypertension in conscious dogs. The effects of developing perinephritic hypertension (2-3 weeks) and a more stable period of perinephritic hypertension (approximately 14 weeks) were examined on indexes of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in conscious, chronically instrumented dogs. The complete period of diastole was studied using indexes of isovolumic relaxation (tau), early filling (LV +dD/dt), and stiffness (myocardial stiffness and chamber stress/diameter ratio). During developing hypertension, increased LV end-diastolic pressure, LV end-diastolic stress, peak filling rate, myocardial stiffness, and the stress/diameter ratio increased (p less than 0.05); the time constant tau was not changed. These changes were associated with preserved baseline levels of coronary blood flow (radioactive microspheres) but an impaired coronary vasodilator response to adenosine. Acute administration of phenylephrine in the normotensive dogs caused increases in systolic and diastolic stress and resulted in increases in myocardial stiffness and in the stress/diameter ratio similar to values observed in developing hypertension. During stable hypertension, LV end-diastolic stress, peak filling rate, and both parameters of late-diastolic function (myocardial stiffness and stress/diameter ratio) returned toward control values, but the isovolumic relaxation time constant was increased. Quantitative histological evaluation revealed no increase in stainable connective tissue in dogs with stable hypertension compared with control dogs, and hydroxyproline concentration was not increased in the subendomyocardium, midmyocardium, or subepimyocardium of the dogs with chronic perinephritic hypertension. Thus, in developing hypertension, major alterations in diastolic function were observed that were not structurally related, since these changes 1) could be induced in normal dogs by increasing preload and afterload acutely with phenylephrine and 2) were improved during the ensuing stable period of hypertension. 
5	Primary abscess of the omentum. A 65-yr-old man presented with upper abdominal pain and fever due to a primary abscess of the omentum. The finding of microscopic-size foreign particles within the abscess raised the possibility of antecedent clinically silent perforation of the bowel or appendix. Surgical resection and antibiotic therapy were curative. 
3	Long-term follow-up of the use of nonporous hydroxyapatite for augmentation of the alveolar ridge. Particulate hydroxyapatite (HA) was used in the augmentation of 18 mandibular and four maxillary ridges in 21 patients whose cases were followed postoperatively for 5 to 7 years. Patients were evaluated clinically, radiographically, and through questionnaires. Prosthodontic assessment of retention and stability of dentures showed improvement 5 years postoperatively. Patients receiving HA rated their dentures favorably using parameters of the Cornell Medical Index. The results of this study show that particulate HA alone can be used as a satisfactory material for augmentation of the alveolar ridge. 
4	Characteristics of black patients admitted to coronary care units in metropolitan Seattle: results from the Myocardial Infarction Triage and Intervention Registry (MITI). Since 1988, 641 black and 11,892 white patients with chest pain of presumed cardiac origin have been admitted to coronary care units in 19 hospitals in metropolitan Seattle. Black men and women were younger (58 vs 66, p less than 0.0001), more often admitted to central city hospitals (p less than 0.0001), and developed evidence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) less often (19 vs 23%, p = 0.01). In the subset of 2,870 AMI patients, blacks (n = 121) were younger (59 vs 67, p less than 0.0001) and had less prior coronary artery bypass graft surgery (2 vs 10%, p = 0.005) and more prior hypertension (67 vs 46%, p less than 0.0001). During hospitalization, whites (n = 2,749) had higher rates of coronary angioplasty (18 vs 10%, p = 0.03) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (10 vs 4%, p = 0.04), although thrombolytic therapy and cardiac catheterization were used equally in the 2 groups. Hospital mortality was 7.4% for black and 13.1% for white patients (p = 0.07). However, after adjustment for key demographic and clinical variables by logistic regression, this difference was not as apparent (p = 0.38). Questions about the premature onset of coronary artery disease, excess systemic hypertension, and the differential use of interventions in black persons have been raised by other investigators. Despite differences in age, referral patterns and the use of coronary angioplasty and bypass surgery, black and white patients with AMI in metropolitan Seattle had similar outcomes. 
2	A rat model of esophageal varices. We have developed a new method for inducing portal hypertension and esophageal varices in rats--partial ligation of the portal vein after devascularization of the circumference of the left renal vein and complete ligation of the portal vein on the fifth day thereafter. Thirty rats were separated into groups of 10, control (sham operation), complete portal ligation only and complete portal ligation plus devascularization. Two weeks after the surgery, the presence of esophageal varices in rats with complete portal ligation plus devascularization was confirmed by portography and by the histological findings. The diameter (mean +/- SD) of the submucosal veins of the lower esophagus in the complete portal ligation plus devascularization group (219.4 +/- 86.6 microns) was significantly larger than that in the complete portal ligation group (99.8 +/- 53.4 microns) or in the control group (30.5 +/- 16.6 microns) (p less than 0.01). Vascular structures of the lower esophagus closely resembled those in humans with esophageal varices. This new technique is simple, rapid and reliable, and application can be made to various experimental studies on portal hypertension. 
4	Thoracic spinal fractures and aortic rupture: a significant and fatal association. We analyzed the frequency of occurrence of traumatic aortic rupture (TAR) in patients with and without thoracic spinal fractures. Among 4,676 blunt chest trauma victims admitted to the hospital between 1972 and 1988, 148 (3.2%) suffered one or more thoracic vertebral fractures. There were 73 patients with one or more fractures of the first eight thoracic vertebrae (T1 to T8); of these 73, 4 also suffered TAR (5.5%). There were 4,603 patients without fractures of T1 to T8, and 64 of these patients also suffered TAR (1.4%). This difference was significant by the chi2 and Fisher exact tests, p = 0.00378 and p = 0.021003, respectively. Additionally, all 5 patients with TAR and thoracic vertebral fractures died. We conclude that patients with one or more fractures of T1 to T8 have a statistically significant increase in the incidence of TAR. 
3	Life events and difficulties preceding stroke. Life events and difficulties were recorded for the year before stroke, using a standardised semi-structured interview, in 113 surviving patients seen after their first ever in a lifetime stroke. An age and sex-matched control group (n = 109) was also interviewed about the preceding year. The stroke patients reported fewer non-threatening events and events with only a short-term threat, while difficulties were reported with equal frequency by the two groups. However, events which were severely threatening in the long-term were significantly more common in the stroke patients (in the 52 weeks before stroke 26% versus 13%, odds ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.9). The increased rate was apparent throughout the year and not just in the weeks immediately before stroke onset. The number of stroke patients experiencing severe events in the follow up year fell to the level found in the control group. Recognised risk factors for stroke were found equally in those patients with and without severe events before onset, except that hypertension was rather less common in the patients who had experienced a severe event. It therefore appears that severe life events may be one of the determinants of stroke onset. 
4	Mortality and treated blood pressure in patients of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly. Elderly hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to treatment with diuretics and methyldopa (n = 352) or placebo (n = 339), and divided into three groups, each according to their blood pressures, after nine months of treatment. Subsequently, 65 placebo patients and 56 treated patients died. A U-shaped relation was seen in treated patients between mortality and systolic blood pressure, and in placebo patients between mortality and diastolic blood pressure. Whereas in treated patients, the highest mortality was seen in patients with the lowest diastolic pressure, the lowest mortality was seen in the group with the highest diastolic pressure. The increased mortality in treated patients with the lowest blood pressure may not be drug-induced, but an expression of deterioration in general health, as indicated by the decreases in body weight and hemoglobin levels found in patients with the lowest blood pressures in previous analyses of these data. 
4	Area-at-risk determination by technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile in experimental reperfused myocardial infarction In a canine model of reperfused myocardial infarction, we tested the hypothesis that after reperfusion, technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) tomographic imaging still reflects occlusion blood flow when the tracer is injected before reperfusion. Nine anesthetized dogs underwent 2 hours of coronary occlusion followed by 3 hours of reperfusion ending by being killed. Reference coronary blood flow was determined by radioactive microspheres injected during occlusion and after reperfusion. Biopsies in normal and ischemic myocardium and single photon emission computed tomography were obtained during occlusion and after reperfusion. Circumferential profiles were applied to axial slices divided into 5-degree sectors. The sectors were divided into 3 groups selected on the occlusion acquisition (normal, mildly reduced, and severely reduced) and compared with the postreperfusion acquisition. Tissular Tc-MIBI kinetics was assessed both by Tc-MIBI time-activity curves of normal and ischemic tissue obtained by biopsy and by the relative gradient between normal, ischemic, and necrotic postmortem tissue samples. In biopsy samples, Tc-MIBI content remained unchanged during occlusion and after reperfusion in normal as well as in ischemic tissue (4,662 +/- 2,237 counts/min/mg vs. 4,599 +/- 1,577 counts/min/mg in normal tissue, NS; 941 +/- 903 counts/min/mg vs. 1,087 +/- 721 counts/min/mg in ischemic tissue, NS). In postmortem tissue samples, there was a good correlation between occlusion microsphere blood flow and Tc-MIBI activity (r = 0.91). In the necrotic samples, mean normalized Tc-MIBI activity (10 +/- 17%) was slightly higher than the normalized microsphere blood flow (3 +/- 3%, p less than 0.001) but markedly lower than the normalized microsphere reperfusion blood flow (63 +/- 31%, p less than 0.001). Comparing the single photon emission computed tomographic acquisitions before and after reperfusion, Tc-MIBI activity remained unchanged in normal as well as in mildly reduced or severely reduced segments. Thus, our data are consistent with the hypothesis that Tc-MIBI traces blood flow, does not redistribute significantly despite reperfusion, and can be used for imaging the area at risk. 
4	Secondary prevention with verapamil after myocardial infarction. The Danish Study Group on Verapamil in Myocardial Infarction. The effect of verapamil on death and major events (i.e., death or reinfarction) after an acute myocardial infarction was studied in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial, the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trial II (DAVIT II). Eight hundred seventy-eight patients started treatment with verapamil 360 mg/day and 897 patients with placebo. Treatment continued for up to 18 months (mean 16 months). Ninety-five deaths and 146 major events occurred in the verapamil group and 119 deaths and 180 major events in the placebo group. Eighteen-month mortality rates were 11.1 and 13.8% (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% confidence limits 0.63 to 1.05, p = 0.108), and major event rates 18.0 and 21.6% (0.80, 0.64 to 0.99, p = 0.027) in the verapamil and placebo groups respectively. When combining the results of this trial with the results of the first Danish study on verapamil in myocardial infarction, the meta-analysis demonstrated that treatment with verapamil from the second week after an acute myocardial infarction resulted in a reduction of pooled odds ratios of 0.22 (95% confidence interval 0.01 to 0.37, p = 0.04) for death, 0.21 (0.05 to 0.35, p = 0.02) for major events, and 0.27 (0.06 to 0.43, p = 0.02) for first reinfarctions. It is concluded that long-term treatment with verapamil after an acute myocardial infarction is associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality as well as major event and reinfarction rates. 
1	Acquired childhood aphasia. Outcome 1 year after onset. The effects of the variables age at onset, cause, severity and bilaterality of lesion, and type of aphasia on course and outcome were investigated in a group of 28 aphasic children. Analysis of spontaneous speech and tests of auditory verbal comprehension were used to determine the presence of aphasia. The severity of the cerebral lesion was assessed using a rating scale for computed tomographic scans. Most of the children had not recovered completely 1 year after onset. Recovery was significantly different according to etiological categories. Complete recovery was seen in the majority of traumatic cases. 
5	Immunohistochemical demonstration of keratin in ameloblastoma as an indication of tumor differentiation. Keratin expression was studied immunohistochemically in 27 ameloblastomas using polyclonal antibody against wide-spectrum keratins (TTL) and monoclonal antibodies against lower- and higher-molecular-weight keratins (PKK1 and KL1), respectively, to clarify the tumor differentiation. Reactions with TTL and KL1 antibodies were generally positive in the stellate cells of the follicular or acanthomatous ameloblastomas. Cell nests of the basal cell type were positive for PKK1. On the other hand, the reactions with TTL or KL1 in the plexiform type were generally weak or absent. From these facts, it was concluded that the follicular, as well as acanthomatous, ameloblastoma is liable to undergo squamous differentiation, whereas the plexiform ameloblastoma remains in primitive stage of tumor differentiation. 
5	Bretylium tosylate versus lidocaine in experimental cardiac arrest Bretylium tosylate has been shown effective in the treatment of ventricular fibrillation and in the prevention of its recurrence. However, lidocaine is generally preferred because bretylium could have adverse hemodynamic effects related to its antiadrenergic action. To explore further the differences between these two antiarrhythmic agents, the authors compared the effects of bretylium, lidocaine, and saline on a standardized dog model of ventricular fibrillation followed by electromechanical dissociation (EMD). The protocol included three successive episodes of cardiac arrest in each animal. Three minutes before each episode of ventricular fibrillation, 5 mg/kg of bretylium tosylate (n = 11), 1 mg/kg of lidocaine (n = 9) or saline (n = 12) were administered blindly. There was no difference in the duration of cardiac arrest (bretylium, 8 min 18 sec; lidocaine, 7 min 54 sec; saline, 8 min 20 sec) or the total doses of epinephrine required to resuscitate the animals. Both bretylium and lidocaine appeared to preserve cardiac function 5 minutes after recovery, as stroke volume increased from 17.8 +/- 6.7 to 18.7 +/- 6.7 mL (NS) after bretylium and from 17.7 +/- 7.7 to 19.0 +/- 7.0 mL (NS) after lidocaine, but decreased from 19.0 +/- 5.3 to 14.6 +/- 6.0 mL (P less than .05) after saline. During the first 10 minutes of EMD, ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia recurred in 4 dogs treated with lidocaine, 3 dogs treated with saline, but no dog treated with bretylium (P less than .05 between bretylium and saline). 
4	Right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale caused by pulmonary hypertension associated with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome: a case report. This case report presents a fifty-four-year-old woman with right-to-left shunt in the atrium. It seemed clinically at first that the shunt was due to atrial septal defect. However, she also had pulmonary disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome. At autopsy atrial septal defect was not evident, but a patent foramen ovale and pulmonary artery disease were observed. This case suggests that pulmonary hypertension secondary to rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome could lead to right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale. 
4	Tricuspid atresia or severe stenosis with partial common atrioventricular canal: anatomic data, clinical profile and surgical considerations. The anatomic findings in 11 cases of tricuspid atresia and in two cases of severe tricuspid stenosis, both combined with partial common atrioventricular (AV) canal, are presented in detail. Twelve cases were documented by postmortem examination and the diagnosis was confirmed by echocardiography and surgical observation in the one living patient. Clinical data available in nine cases and cardiac catheterization data obtained in eight are included in this report. In three cases (23%)--two with tricuspid atresia and one with extreme tricuspid stenosis--the tricuspid valve and right ventricle exhibited characteristics seen in Ebstein's anomaly. In all 13 cases, the great arteries were normally related. The ventricular septal defect(s) in 10 (83%) of the 12 postmortem cases rapidly became smaller and this resulted in marked diminution of the pulmonary blood flow and severe hypoxia. Only three of the eight patients with available cardiac catheterization and angiocardiographic data showed the scooped-out appearance of the left ventricular septal surface characteristic of AV canal defects. By contrast, two-dimensional echocardiography, available in the three most recent cases, accurately demonstrated all the defects present and represents the diagnostic method of choice. Early surgical intervention to establish a systemic to pulmonary artery anastomosis is essential for survival. More definitive surgical treatment can be achieved later by an atriopulmonary or cavopulmonary anastomosis with or without replacement of the cleft and often regurgitant mitral valve. The one living patient exemplifies this approach. This is the largest series of this unusual type of tricuspid atresia reported to date. 
2	Loop ileostomy after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis--is it necessary? Construction of a loop ileostomy is usually advised in patients having an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis to minimize the complication of chronic pelvic sepsis. Formation and closure of a loop ileostomy was associated with a 41 percent and 30 percent complication rate, respectively, in a prospective series of 34 patients. This morbidity must now be assessed in relation to the benefits of avoiding temporary fecal diversion in restorative proctocolectomy. 
4	Spinal cord hemangioblastoma with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A case of subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a cervical hemangioblastoma is presented. The clinical picture was indistinguishable from that of a subarachnoid hemorrhage from an intracranial lesion. The diagnosis was established by angiography and water-soluble contrast myelography followed by cervical computed tomographic scan. At surgery, the tumor was completely removed, and no neurological deficit was observed after the operation. 
3	A comparison of regulatory cells in spinal fluid and blood in patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurologic diseases. Multiple sclerosis is a disease in which immune abnormalities are present both in the CNS and peripheral blood. Whether these changes are primary or secondary to the disease process is not known. We tested T-cell clones derived from activated lymphocytes in the blood and CSF of MS patients and controls for their capacity to regulate T-cell responses to alloantigens. A wide spectrum of regulatory functions were observed, ranging from marked enhancement to almost complete suppression. Clones from different patient populations and anatomic sites were equivalent in their regulatory functions with the net effect of clones in each compartment being suppression. However, certain clones from CSF and peripheral blood had the capacity to stimulate autologous T cells. Percentages of such clones in the peripheral blood of MS patients were significantly higher than in controls, while percentages in MS and other neurologic diseases (OND) CSF were equivalent. Our data suggest that (1) functional suppressor cells are not lost from the blood or CSF or MS and OND patients, (2) lymphocytes that have entered the CNS in patients with MS and other CNS diseases have equivalent regulatory functions, (3) MS may be an illness in which peripheral immunologic events are important in perpetuating the disease process, and (4) responses to autologous antigens may also play a role in this perpetuation. 
3	Rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure. The pathogenesis and therapy of respiratory failure in the rigid spine syndrome are discussed in two cases who improved with respiratory assistance. In both cases, the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide were reversed in arterial blood gas analysis and %VC was less than 30%. Remission from respiratory failure has been obtained by the use of a ventilator during the night. The cause of the respiratory failure in both cases was severe restrictive respiratory dysfunction due to extreme flattening of the chest and fixation of the thorax during respiration as a result of contracture of costovertebral joints. All the previously reported cases of the rigid spine syndrome with respiratory failure died. Appropriate use of the ventilator can improve the prognosis. 
5	Effect of marked peripheral leukocytosis on the leukocyte count in ascites. Patients with high peripheral leukocyte counts are sometimes found to have high leukocyte counts in ascitic fluid in the presence of negative cultures. To determine if peripheral leukocytosis (greater than or equal to 20 x 10(9)/L) by itself can result in high leukocyte or neutrophil counts in ascites, 29 patients were studied. A total of 31 paracenteses were performed in these patients as soon as the high peripheral leukocyte count was determined. Culture of ascitic fluid was performed using blood-culture bottles. The mean peripheral leukocyte count was 29.3 +/- 9.3 x 10(9)/L, with a mean neutrophil count of 19.9 +/- 6.5 x 10(9)/L. The mean ascitic fluid neutrophil count was 0.064 +/- 0.054 x 10(9)/L (range, 0.007 to 0.197 x 10(9)/L). No significant correlation was found between peripheral neutrophil (or leukocyte) count and neutrophil (or leukocyte) count in ascitic fluid. Marked peripheral leukocytosis (or neutrophilia) does not seem to have an effect on the leukocyte or neutrophil count in ascitic fluid. 
5	Prolonged continuous acyclovir treatment of normal adults with frequently recurring genital herpes simplex virus infection. The Acyclovir Study Group. In this 3-year study of suppressive acyclovir for recurrent genital herpes, patients with more than six recurrences per year were randomized initially to 400 mg of acyclovir or placebo orally two times per day, with recurrences treated with 200 mg of acyclovir five times per day for 5 days. In the second year of the study, all patients received acyclovir as a daily suppressive or intermittent acute therapy; in the third year, all received daily acyclovir. Among 525 patients completing 3 study years, 289 received 3 years of suppressive therapy and 236 received 1 year of acute therapy followed by 2 years of suppressive therapy. Of those who completed the third year, 61% were recurrence free that year; 25% of the suppressive therapy-only group were recurrence free for all 3 years. The annual recurrence rate dropped from more than 12 recurrences per year at baseline to 1.0 (suppressive therapy) and 1.4 (acute and suppressive therapy) recurrences during the third year. No significant toxic effects were detected. Daily suppressive acyclovir therapy was effective and well tolerated. 
5	Infection in the myelodysplastic syndromes. PURPOSE: To determine the incidence, characteristics, and outcome of infection in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and risk factors that may lead to infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed infections that occurred in 86 consecutive patients with MDS who received care from 1968 to 1986 at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Time lines charting the course of each patient with MDS were created and included infections, MDS subgroup at the time of presentation and at the time of each infection, peripheral neutrophil counts, and therapies for MDS. RESULTS: Infections occurred at a rate of nearly one per patient year of observation. Infection rates were associated with MDS subgroup as follows: refractory anemia with or without ringed sideroblasts (RA +/- RS) less than refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB) less than RAEB in transformation (RAEB-T). The group of RA +/- RS patients who had erythroid abnormalities but minimal or no dyspoiesis of other cell lines had the lowest rate of infections. Infection rates were higher in patients with less than or equal to 1,000 neutrophils/microL blood than in patients with greater than 1,000 neutrophils/microL blood for each classifiable MDS subgroup. Neutrophil concentration and MDS subgroup were independent risk factors for infection in patients with MDS. Bacterial pneumonias and skin abscesses were the most common infections. Infection was the most common cause of death during MDS, accounting for 64% of deaths, and was more common than transformation to acute leukemia as a cause of death. CONCLUSION: Infection is a common, life-threatening problem in patients with MDS. Neutropenia and MDS subgroup are each risk factors for infection. Clinicians should aggressively evaluate patients with fever and MDS for infection, especially pneumonia and skin infections. 
5	Patient-controlled analgesic administration. A comparison of steady-state morphine infusions with bolus doses. The authors have shown previously that bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients who self-administered bolus doses of morphine gained equal oral mucositis pain relief while using less drug compared with similar patients receiving morphine by staff-controlled continuous infusion. In a follow-up study they compared the efficacy and side effects of morphine in two groups of marrow transplant patients who controlled their own analgesic administration either by conventional bolus-dose, patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) or by adjusting the rate of continuous morphine infusion to increase or decrease their plasma morphine concentration. Patients controlling their morphine infusion rates (pharmacokinetically based patient-controlled analgesia [PKPCA] group) obtained more relief from oral mucositis pain than did patients using conventional PCA. Patients in the PKPCA group used more morphine than PCA patients and achieved superior pain relief without significant increases in side effects (e.g., nausea, mood changes, sedation). The authors conclude that PKPCA improves the management of prolonged, severe pain in marrow transplant patients and that this approach to patient-controlled analgesia may be useful in other types of persistent pain. 
1	Mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap after resection of carcinoma of the esophagus involving the proximal part of the trachea. An operative procedure of mediastinal tracheostomy using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is presented. In this procedure, the terminal portion of the trachea penetrates through the center of a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap and the tracheal wall is completely wrapped with the muscular portion of the flap. Between 1981 and 1988, eight patients with carcinoma in the cervicothoracic segment of the esophagus underwent mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy and extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea through sternal manubrectomy, because of invasion into the trachea. In five of eight patients, a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap was used to construct a tracheal stoma. A skin flap only, or both a skin flap and a muscle flap, was used in the other three. In four of eight patients, tracheal necrosis occurred, and rupture of the brachiocephalic artery occurred in one patient when the tracheal stoma had been constructed using both a skin flap and a muscle flap. However, neither skin breakdown nor bleeding from the major vessels occurred when using the myocutaneous flap. Therefore, it is concluded that the construction of the tracheal stoma using a pectoralis major myocutaneous flap is recommended for mediastinal tracheostomy after laryngoesophagectomy with extended resection of the proximal part of the trachea. 
3	Polyneuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, leukoencephalopathy, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction: POLIP syndrome. We describe 5 individuals (from three separate families) with a progressive neurological disorder characterized by sensorimotor peripheral polyneuropathy, cranial neuropathies (external ophthalmoplegia, deafness), and the syndrome of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. Magnetic resonance imaging showed widespread abnormality of the cerebral and cerebellar white matter in the 2 patients studied. Autopsy examination in 3 revealed widespread endoneurial fibrosis and demyelination in the peripheral nervous system, possibly secondary to axonal atrophy, and poorly defined changes in cerebral white matter (leukoencephalopathy). The cranial nerves and spinal roots were less severely involved and the neurons in the brainstem and spinal cord were intact. The fatal gastrointestinal dysmotility was due to a severe visceral neuropathy. We suggest that these patients manifested a hereditary disorder with distinctive clinical, radiological, and neuropathological features, and propose the acronym POLIP to emphasize the distinctive tetrad of polyneuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, leukoencephalopathy, and intestinal pseudo-obstruction. 
4	Impaired left ventricular filling and regional diastolic asynchrony at rest in coronary artery disease and relation to exercise-induced myocardial ischemia. Impaired left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling at rest is frequently observed in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who have normal LV systolic function and no previous infarction. To test the hypothesis that abnormal diastolic function at rest might reflect the functional severity of CAD, as estimated by exercise-induced ischemia, the relation between regional and global LV diastolic function at rest and during exercise-induced ischemia was evaluated in 49 patients with radionuclide angiography. All patients had normal systolic function at rest. Group 1 (n = 26) patients manifested a normal ejection fraction response to exercise and group 2 (n = 23) patients an abnormal response. Data obtained from 22 age-comparable normal volunteers were used for comparison. Although regional and global diastolic function were not different between normal subjects and group 1 patients, peak filling rate was lower in group 2 patients than in normal subjects (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs 3.2 +/- 0.6 end-diastolic counts/s; p less than 0.01). Moreover, regional diastolic asynchrony, as assessed from the radionuclide data by using a regional sector analysis of the LV region of interest, was greater in group 2 patients (46 +/- 44 ms) than in both normal subjects (25 +/- 16 ms; p less than 0.05) and group 1 patients (23 +/- 16 ms; p less than 0.05). Thus, among patients with CAD and with normal LV systolic function at rest, impaired LV filling and regional asynchrony predict a greater degree of exercise-induced ischemia, suggesting a greater extent of jeopardized myocardium. 
5	The Gore-Tex anterior cruciate ligament prosthesis. Two versus three year results. A prospective clinical study of the results of prosthetic ligament replacement of the ACL with the Gore-Tex polytetrafluoroethylene prosthesis was undertaken. Thirty-three (80%) of 41 patients were available at a minimum 36 month followup (mean, 48 months; range, 36 to 62). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed an 82% probability of survival of the polytetrafluoroethylene ligament at the 48 month followup. When compared to the same data at a minimum 24 month followup, the results appeared to have deteriorated somewhat over time. Three possible "predictors" of failure at later followup were identified: preoperative subjective symptoms of swelling, subjective symptoms of giving way at 2 years, and an increased anterior drawer sign at 2 years. 
3	Effect of systemic medetomidine, an alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist, on experimental pain in humans. The effect of systemic (intravenous) medetomidine, an alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist, on pain thresholds was studied in healthy human subjects (n = 6). Medetomidine produced a dose-dependent (cumulative doses: 25 and 50 micrograms) sedative effect evaluated by visual analog scale. Also, a dose-dependent decrease of blood pressure but not of heart rate was seen after administration of medetomidine. Pain threshold to electric stimulation of the tooth pulp and cutaneous heat pain threshold were uninfluenced by medetomidine. An index of cutaneous thermal sensitivity to innocuous stimuli, the width of the thermoneutral zone, also was uninfluenced by medetomidine. Medetomidine produced a significant attenuation of the affective-motivational component (unpleasantness) of tourniquet-induced ischemic pain, whereas the sensory-discriminative component (pain magnitude estimate) of the ischemic pain was not attenuated. The results suggest that systemic medetomidine alone at subanesthetic but sedative and hypotensive doses does not significantly influence the intensity and thresholds of experimental pain, whereas the affective-motivational component of pain can be attenuated. 
4	An unusual complication of cardiac transplantation--infected aortic pseudoaneurysm. Infections after cardiac transplantation are a frequent cause of early morbidity and mortality. An unusual site for such a complication is at the aortic anastomotic suture line. We report a case of an infected aortic pseudoaneurysm, seen as recurrent septicemia, during the first 6 months after cardiac transplantation. 
5	Recurrent thoracic outlet syndrome after first rib resection. Seventy-seven patients with 84 operated limbs participated in a follow-up examination on an average of about six years after the resection of the first rib for thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS). Forty-two limbs (50%) were totally asymptomatic one month after the operation and remained so for at least half a year postoperatively. In the follow-up examination, 31 limbs were still asymptomatic, whereas 11 limbs had the same symptoms as before the operation. Of the nine patients with recurrent TOS (two with bilateral resection), seven were women and two were men. These nine patients were on average 38 years old (range = 19 to 51 years) and their jobs consisted of monotonous desk work. Seven of 11 stumps of the first rib were subluxated disclosed by the cervical rotation-lateral-flexion test. The occurrence of a subluxated stump of the first rib in the group of asymptomatic patients was far lower, only 3% (p less than .001). Of the 42 patients with persistent problems, a subluxated stump was encountered in seven (17%). Results of this follow-up examination suggest that monotonous desk work is an important factor causing kinesiologic abnormalities in the thoracic aperture. This abnormal kinesiology contributes to the recurrence of TOS symptoms even after the resection of the first rib. 
1	Tumors of the shoulder girdle. Technique of resection and description of a surgical classification. Limb-sparing surgery is safe and reliable for most bone and soft-tissue tumors of the shoulder girdle. Eighty to ninety percent of patients with high-grade sarcomas of the shoulder can be safely treated by the various surgical techniques described. Attention must be paid to appropriate patient selection, preoperative staging, and planning. In addition, careful skeletal and muscular reconstruction of the surgical defect is necessary for a successful outcome. A new, universal, classification schemata (types I-VI) of shoulder girdle resections has been developed. This classification system is based on the bones resected, the status of the abductor mechanism, and the relationship to the glenohumeral joint. This system permits easy description and comparison of the various limb-sparing procedures performed. 
4	The effect of dopexamine HCl upon collateral perfusion of the acutely ischemic myocardium in anesthetized dogs. The effects of low-dose (10(-9) and 3 x 10(-9) mole/kg/min) infusions of dopexamine HCl, a new synthetic catecholamine with beta 2-adrenergic and DA1-dopaminergic agonostic actions, was tested in anesthetized dogs, with and without acute ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The infusions caused diastolic arterial blood pressure to fall by 12 +/- 4 and 23 +/- 5 mmHg, respectively. Microsphere-estimated collateral blood flow to the ischemic myocardium did not change significantly during the drug infusions. The findings suggest that low doses of dopexamine HCl do not cause coronary "steal" from acutely ischemic myocardium. 
5	Effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on neutropenia due to chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The authors administered recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) to 16 patients with advanced non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with combination chemotherapy. Groups of three to five patients were treated with 50, 100, 200, and 400 micrograms/m2 per day of rhG-CSF by intravenous infusion for 14 days, beginning 3 days after chemotherapy. There was a strong linear relationship between the dose and the area under the curve over this dose range. The rhG-CSF was rapidly cleared from serum, with a mean half-life of 5.97 hours for the second phase (t1/2). In patients treated with a dose of more than 100 micrograms/m2 per day, the duration of neutropenia (P less than 0.01) and the duration of fever (P less than 0.05) were significantly decreased. The rhG-CSF was well tolerated and the only clinical observation that appeared relating to rhG-CSF administration was slight bone pain. This study strongly suggests that an optimum dose of rhG-CSF in patients after chemotherapy is 100 to 200 micrograms/m2. Our study shows that rhG-CSF is a clinically useful drug for patients treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy. 
4	Sotalol versus quinidine for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after direct current conversion of atrial fibrillation This open, parallel-group study compares quinidine and sotalol treatment for maintenance of sinus rhythm after direct current conversion of patients with chronic atrial fibrillation. The patients from 15 centers in Sweden were randomized to sotalol (98 patients) or quinidine (85 patients) after 2 hours of sinus rhythm after direct current conversion. According to primary efficacy assessment, 52% of the patients in the sotalol group and 48% of the patients in the quinidine group remained in sinus rhythm during the following 6-month treatment period (NS). Furthermore, 34% of the patients treated with sotalol and 22% of the patients treated with quinidine relapsed into atrial fibrillation (NS). Heart rate after relapsing into atrial fibrillation was higher in the patients treated with quinidine (109 beats/min) than in the patients treated with sotalol (78 beats/min, p less than 0.001). Patients treated with sotalol were found to be less symptomatic at the time of relapse compared with relapsing patients in the quinidine group. In terms of safety, more patients were withdrawn from quinidine than from sotalol treatment (26% vs. 11%, p less than 0.05), and sotalol was generally better tolerated than quinidine. Twenty-eight percent of the patients treated with sotalol and 50% of the patients treated with quinidine reported side effects (p less than 0.01). The difference was primarily a result of early (within the first month of treatment) gastrointestinal and skin side effects in the group of patients treated with quinidine. 
1	Comparison of methods for checking surgical margins. Surgical margins of a cutaneous neoplasm can be evaluated by various combinations of three major types of sections: vertical (perpendicular), horizontal (parallel), and oblique (Mohs method). Vertical sections may run transversely through tumor (breadloaf method), longitudinally through tumor (breadloaf-cross method), or peripheral to the tumor. The peripheral (perimeter) sectioning methods are the only methods that can evaluate almost 100% of the margin, but they have the disadvantage of not showing the relationship of the tumor to its margin, which can be seen clearly with the vertical transverse sections. Seven methods of checking surgical margins are compared and contrasted. None of these is judged to be perfect or best. 
2	Economic barriers to the use of oral rehydration therapy. A case report Diarrheal dehydration is a highly prevalent condition among young children and is readily prevented and treated with oral rehydration therapy. We report a death due to hypernatremic dehydration caused by rotavirus diarrhea of a 9-month-old infant whose mother attempted to purchase oral glucose-electrolyte solution in a pharmacy but was unable to afford it. While efforts such as the National ORT Project should help to promote the proper at-home treatment of this condition, we conclude that oral rehydration therapy will not be used optimally by the parents of children living in poverty until the economic barriers to its use are removed. 
5	Vitamin E supplementation and periventricular hemorrhage in the newborn. In a randomized controlled trial preterm babies received 20 mg vitamin E/kg im soon after birth (day 0) and at 24 and 48 h. The mean +/- SD plasma vitamin E level on day 0 was identical in supplemented and control groups (9.98 +/- 4.88 mumol/L) and rose progressively only in supplemented babies reaching a peak of 69.2 +/- 21.36 mumol/L at 72 h. Supplemented babies had a lower incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) diagnosed by ultrasound (9/102, 8.8%) than the control group (37/108, 34.3%; 95% CI for difference in incidence, 15-36%). In a subsequent uncontrolled study using the same vitamin E preparation, a single dose of 20 mg/kg was given soon after birth to preterm babies. The peak mean +/- SD plasma level was 32.97 +/- 13.47 mumol/L at 48 h. The incidence of IVH (16/121, 13.2%) was lower than in historical control from the randomized trial (95% CI for difference; 10.2-31.8%) in spite of the single-dose group having more clinical risk factors for IVH. We conclude that vitamin E protects against IVH in preterm babies. 
4	Substance P, acetylcholinesterase, and beta-endorphin levels in the plasma and pericardial fluid of patients with and without angina pectoris. We measured substance P-like immunoreactivity (SPLI), beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (BELI), acetylcholinesterase activity, and total protein content in pericardial fluid and plasma of patients with angina pectoris and patients with no angina pectoris. SPLI and BELI levels, acetylcholinesterase activity, and total protein content were determined by radioimmunoassay, a colorimetric method, and by the method of Lowry et al. (J Biol Chem 1951; 193:265-75), respectively. In the pericardial fluid, patients with angina had SPLI, BELI, acetylcholinesterase, and total protein values of 1.69 +/- 0.23 fmol/mg protein, 0.16 +/- 0.13 fmol/mg protein, 0.06 +/- 0.02 units, and 25.7 +/- 3.2 mg/ml, respectively. Patients with no angina had SPLI, BELI, acetylcholinesterase, and total protein values of 0.93 +/- 0.17 fmol/mg protein, 0.19 +/- 0.10 fmol/mg protein, 0.16 +/- 0.02 units, and 44.6 +/- 5.3 mg/ml, respectively. SPLI levels were significantly higher (p less than 0.03), and acetylcholinesterase (less than 0.002) and total protein content (less than 0.004) were significantly lower in the pericardial fluid of patients with angina when compared with those of patients with no angina. BELI levels were not significantly different between the two groups. In the plasma, no significant differences were found in SPLI, BELI, acetylcholinesterase, and total protein values between the two groups of patients. Patients with angina had SPLI, BELI, acetylcholinesterase, and total protein values of 0.47 +/- 0.26 fmol/mg protein, 0.06 +/- 0.06 fmol/mg protein, 0.29 +/- 0.15 units, and 68.2 +/- 8.7 mg/ml, respectively. 
4	Hypoglycemia, hypotonia, and cardiomyopathy: the evolving clinical picture of long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Inherited defects in fatty acid oxidation, which have been described and diagnosed with increasing frequency in the last decade, are most commonly attributed to a deficiency in the activity of medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Few cases of the related enzyme defect of long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity have been reported. An infant with documented long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency is described with a detailed metabolic profile, long-term clinical follow-up, and response to treatment. This patient is compared with the seven previously published cases of this disorder in order to stress the unique features of the initial presentation, more subtle late manifestations of the disease, and clinical and biochemical differentiation from the more common medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This report stresses the enlarging spectrum of the clinical presentation and natural history of this defect in fatty acid oxidation. 
5	Long-term follow-up of patients after transcatheter direct current ablation of the atrioventricular junction. The long-term follow-up study (41 +/- 23 months) of 47 patients undergoing direct current ablation because of drug-resistant supraventricular arrhythmias is reported. Significant early complications occurred in four patients and included hypotension, pericarditis, nonsustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and one sudden death. In 42 patients (86%), complete atrioventricular (AV) block was initially achieved. During the follow-up period, AV conduction resumed in 2 of these 42 patients. Of the seven patients in whom ablation was unsuccessful, two developed late complete AV block and three had symptomatic improvement. An improved activity level was reported among 83% of the patients with successful ablation. Health care utilization manifest as the number of hospital admissions per year before and after ablation decreased significantly after ablation (2.4 +/- 2.0 versus 0.3 +/- 0.5, p less than 0.001). Echocardiographic evaluation in five patients with a depressed left ventricular ejection fraction (27 +/- 7%) before ablation showed a significant increase (45 +/- 14%, p less than 0.05) after an average follow-up period of 31 months. New onset of congestive heart failure occurred after ablation in four patients, of whom two had no structural heart disease. The total mortality rate, including the one patient with sudden death, was 17% and was significantly higher among patients with underlying structural heart disease. Transcatheter direct current ablation is an effective treatment in patients with drug-resistant supraventricular tachycardia, providing a beneficial long-term outcome including an improved quality of life and a decrease in health care utilization. 
1	Adenomatous polyp of the fallopian tube. A case report. Benign epithelial lesions of the fallopian tube are rare. An adenomatous polyp of the fallopian tube was discovered incidentally at laparotomy. 
1	Autograft versus allograft for benign lesions in children. Benign bone lesions in children are often so large in size that there is not an adequate amount of bone available for an autograft to fill the resultant cavity after surgical curettage. This study compared autografts and allografts with respect to the time required and the success of graft incorporation. Fifty-four patients with 61 lesions were studied. Lesions were classified as small volume (less than 60 cc) or large volume (more than 60 cc) and were separated into four groups: small-volume autograft, large-volume autograft, small-volume allograft, and large-volume allograft. Allografts appeared comparable to autografts when small-volume lesions were treated. The healing time was slightly longer for allografts with an average period of 21 months versus 27 months for autografts. Autografts were superior to allografts in rate and completeness of healing for solitary large lesions. This increased efficacy presumes a somewhat older child in which an adequate amount of bone is available for an autograft. A young child with multicentric or polyostotic lesions can still achieve successful incorporation with allografts. In this study, 38% healed completely and 29% healed partially. Allografts have a distinct place in the treatment of benign bone lesions in children. 
1	Treatment of manifest and impending pathologic fractures of the femoral neck by cemented hemiarthroplasty. Thirty-four patients with manifest or impending pathologic fractures of the femoral neck were treated between 1971 and 1987. Breast carcinoma was the primary tumor in the majority of patients. All patients were treated with cemented hemiarthroplasty. Twenty-seven patients (79%) could walk at an average of nine days postoperatively. All patients experienced relief of pain. Two superficial wound dehiscences, one loosening of the prosthesis, and two prosthetic dislocations were encountered. Mean survival was 17.6 months overall (12 months for manifest fractures and 40 months for impending fractures). These results indicate that cemented hemiarthroplasty for pathologic fractures is a safe procedure resulting in long-lasting palliation without necessitating postoperative irradiation. The importance of tumor excochleation and the advantages of bone cement are emphasized. 
2	Conservation surgery for glomus jugulare tumors: the value of early diagnosis. The results of lateral cranial base surgery for glomus jugulare tumors are gratifying when normal anatomy and function can be preserved. The goal of conservation surgery is to preserve normal ear anatomy and cranial nerve function. In general, conservation surgery is tumor-size dependent. Thus, excellent states of functional recovery depend upon accurate early diagnosis. This paper reviews the technical aspects of transtemporal conservation skull base tumor surgery while also reviewing our experience with nearly 100 glomus jugulare patients. Adjuvants to early diagnosis will be highlighted from a review of presenting symptoms, clinical signs, and related diagnosis. Our objective is to provoke a high index of suspicion in physicians charged with the responsibility of diagnosing these tumors. Diagnostic guidelines are proposed. 
4	Atenolol in essential hypertension during pregnancy OBJECTIVE--To determine the effect of atenolol on the outcome of pregnancy in women with essential hypertension. DESIGN--Prospective, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study. SETTING--Hospital clinic. PATIENTS--33 Women with mild essential hypertension (systolic blood pressure 140-170 mm Hg or diastolic pressure 90-110 mm Hg on two occasions at least 24 hours apart) consecutively referred to two obstetric medical clinics. Four patients in the placebo group were withdrawn from the study: control of blood pressure was inadequate in two, one developed breathlessness, and one changed her mind about participating. The mean gestation in the 29 remaining women on entry to the study was 15.9 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Blood pressure and birth weight. INTERVENTION--14 Women received placebo. 15 Women received atenolol 50 mg daily initially, increasing until either the blood pressure was less than 140/90 mm Hg or a dose of 200 micrograms daily was reached. RESULTS--The mean blood pressure on entry was 148/86 mm Hg in the group given atenolol and 144/86 mm Hg in the group given placebo. During treatment the mean diastolic pressure was significantly reduced by atenolol compared with placebo (to 74 v 81 mm Hg; difference in means (95% confidence interval) 7.0 (2.9 to 10.0) mm Hg) but the effect on systolic pressure was marginal (132 v 136 mm Hg; 4.0 (-1.4 to 8.6) mm Hg). Babies in the atenolol group had a significantly lower birth weight than those in the placebo group (2620 g v 3530 g; 910 (440 to 1380)g). CONCLUSION--Atenolol given from the end of the first trimester in patients with mild hypertension is associated with intrauterine growth retardation. When taken in conjunction with the results of a previous study in which methyldopa was given these findings indicate that benefit is unlikely to result from treating mild essential hypertension in pregnancy. 
1	Initial results with slightly modified Kock pouch. My initial experience with 20 patients undergoing Kock pouch continent urinary diversion is reviewed. The procedure has been slightly modified from that described by Kock and Skinner. All patients have been followed for at least four months (median, 33 months). There have been no early complications related to the pouch. The most significant problem, incontinence, has occurred in 2 patients (10%) at three and four months, respectively, after surgery. Only 1 of these patients required temporary use of an external appliance. Leakage was due, in both cases, to a patulous efferent nipple valve. Both were repaired by plication of the nipple, and no new efferent limbs were constructed. In 1 patient (5%) prolapse of the afferent limb associated with reflux and pyelonephritis developed one year post-surgery. Stones have developed in 3 patients (15%). All patients are currently continent and stone-free, and all are pleased with the result. 
1	A chance to cut is a chance to cure? Fifty-seven patients underwent local excision of an invasive distal rectal cancer as an initial operative procedure with curative intent. Five-year survival was 82.5%, and the rectal cancer specific mortality rate was only 10.5%. The level of wall invasion, vascular permeation, tumor ulceration, mobility, and differentiation were the criteria studied for prognosis. Poor prognostic factors included mucinous cell differentiation and full thickness invasion, and in these cases, abdominoperineal resection was recommended. None of the 27 patients without these adverse prognostic factors died from rectal cancer. The other factors did not appear to influence the outcome, and local excision of distal rectal cancer would be the treatment of choice in such selected patients. 
3	Effects of local reduction in pressure on distensibility and composition of cerebral arterioles. This study examined effects of local reductions in mean and pulse pressures on cerebral arterioles in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) and stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). WKY and SHRSP underwent clipping of one carotid artery at 1 month of age. At 10-12 months of age, mechanics of pial arterioles were examined in vivo in anesthetized rats. Bilateral craniotomies were performed to expose pial arterioles in the sham and clipped cerebral hemispheres. Stress-strain relations were calculated from measurements of pial arteriolar pressure (servo null), diameter, and cross-sectional area of the arteriolar wall. Point counting stereology was used to quantitate individual components in the arteriolar wall. Before deactivation of smooth muscle with EDTA, mean (Pm) and pulse (Pp) pressures were significantly less (p less than 0.05) in clipped than in sham arterioles in WKY (Pm, 63 +/- 2 versus 73 +/- 2 mm Hg; Pp, 23 +/- 3 versus 30 +/- 3 mm Hg) and SHRSP (Pm, 94 +/- 4 versus 110 +/- 4 mm Hg; Pp, 27 +/- 2 versus 38 +/- 3 mm Hg). Cross-sectional area of the arteriolar wall was less (p less than 0.05) in clipped than in sham arterioles in both groups of rats (1,403 +/- 125 versus 1,683 +/- 125 microns2 in WKY; 1,436 +/- 72 versus 1,926 +/- 134 microns2 in SHRSP). There was a correlation between cross-sectional area of the vessel wall and pulse pressure (r2 = 0.66), but not mean pressure (r2 = 0.09). During maximal dilatation with EDTA, the stress-strain curve was shifted to the left in clipped arterioles of SHRSP, but not of WKY, which indicates that carotid clipping in SHRSP reduces passive distensibility of cerebral arterioles. The proportion of distensible components in the vessel wall (smooth muscle, elastin, and endothelium) was reduced in clipped arterioles in SHRSP, but not in WKY. These findings suggest that 1) vascular hypertrophy of cerebral arterioles is related more closely to pulse pressure than to mean pressure, and 2) reduction of pial arteriolar pressure completely prevents cerebral vascular hypertrophy and attenuates increases in passive distensibility of cerebral arterioles in SHRSP. 
4	Infusion of a stable prostacyclin analogue, iloprost, to patients with peripheral vascular disease: lack of antiplatelet effect but risk of thromboembolism. PURPOSE: Prostacyclin, a potent inhibitor of platelet function and vasodilator, has been used to treat peripheral vascular disease. The aim of this study was to monitor the thrombotic status of patients treated by infusion of a stable prostacyclin analogue, iloprost. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients with peripheral vascular disease underwent iloprost infusion for 3 days (8 hours each day) in a dose ranging from 0.5 to 2 ng/kg/minute. Variable parameters of thrombosis such as platelet reactivity (shear-induced hemostatic plug formation and thrombus formation on a collagen fiber), coagulation, and spontaneous thrombolysis (dislodgment of hemostatic plugs) were measured from non-anticoagulated blood samples by hemostatometry immediately before and 1 hour after the infusion and on the last day, 4 hours after initiation of the infusion. RESULTS: Analysis of data from all patients 1 hour after the infusion showed no changes in platelet reactivity and spontaneous thrombolysis, but coagulation was significantly enhanced. In four patients, significant platelet hyperreactivity was observed after the infusion. Four of the five patients tested while undergoing iloprost infusion showed an enhanced thrombotic reaction and markedly enhanced coagulation. Iloprost employed in vitro in a concentration that corresponds to the therapeutic peak blood level caused no inhibition of platelet function but significantly enhanced coagulation. The threshold in vitro iloprost concentration at which anti-platelet effect and increased spontaneous thrombolysis were observed was twice that of the therapeutic blood level. CONCLUSIONS: These findings challenge the view that antagonism of platelet function is an important factor of iloprost therapy. Furthermore, platelet hyperreactivity in some patients and markedly enhanced coagulation during and after infusion of iloprost in general, represent a risk of thromboembolism, especially as patients are already in a prethrombotic condition. 
5	Streamlined approach to creating yeast artificial chromosome libraries from specialized cell sources. The study of tumor-specific chromosomal abnormalities has been severely impeded by an inability to link cytogenetic to molecular data. Restriction fragment length polymorphism mapping of any particular chromosomal rearrangement to the resolution limit of genetic methodology generates sets of probes that frequently are still too widely spaced to render the rearrangement breakpoints accessible to molecular isolation. The stable propagation of genomic fragments of up to one million base pairs in size as yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) represents an important development in this regard. However, existing YAC libraries have been made from karyotypically normal sources making the localization and cloning of specific rearrangement breakpoints much more difficult. As a solution to this problem, we present an improved method for creating YAC libraries that can utilize specialized tumor-derived materials and that can be executed effectively in a small laboratory setting. Procedures that enabled more consistent DNA insert size selection and enhanced yeast transformation frequency were employed to generate a human YAC library from a neuroepithelioma cell line containing a characteristic t(11;22) chromosomal translocation. Approximately 40,000 colonies with an average insert size of 330 kilobase pairs were created. This library was screened with two single-copy probes that bracket the translocation breakpoint. YAC clones ranging from 370 to 550 kilobase pairs that were specific for each single-copy probe were identified. Specialized YAC libraries will make many more tumor-specific chromosomal abnormalities accessible to molecular isolation. 
2	Gastric adaptive relaxation and symptoms after vagotomy. Gastric adaptive relaxation is reported to be impaired after vagotomy. This abnormality has been implicated in the pathogenesis of postvagotomy symptoms, but no association has previously been demonstrated between the two. Gastric adaptive relaxation was measured in 15 healthy volunteers and 33 patients more than 1 year after highly selective vagotomy or truncal vagotomy and drainage. Seventeen patients were asymptomatic. The remainder were symptomatic including seven patients with persistent diarrhoea. Fasted subjects were intubated with a Ryle's tube containing a pressure microtransducer within a flaccid (800 ml) plastic bag. Gastric corpus-fundus pressure was recorded during distension of the bag with air (15 ml/s) over 30 s. Pressure indices were derived from the areas under the pressure curves. Median (range) pressure indices were: healthy volunteers 12.7 (7.5-17.1) cmH2O, highly selective vagotomy 14.0 (9.8-15.9) cmH2O (n.s.), truncal vagotomy and drainage 14.5 (8.6-26.8) cmH2O (P = 0.04). All patients with diarrhoea had abnormally high pressure indices (P less than 0.001). Pressure indices in all other patient groups were within the normal range. We conclude that gastric adaptive relaxation remains abnormal in patients with postvagotomy diarrhoea but not in those who are asymptomatic or who have other symptoms. 
5	Characterization of cytokines present in middle ear effusions. Retention of inflammatory mediators and cells in the middle ear cleft during chronic otitis media with effusion (COME), results in ongoing inflammation with the potential for pathologic changes and hearing loss. Cytokines are glycoproteins produced by macrophages and other cells. Activities of cytokines include fever production, osteoclast, fibroblast, phagocyte and cytotoxic cell activation, regulation of antibody formation, and inhibition of cartilage, bone and endothelial cell growth. Using enzyme-linked immunospecific assays we measured levels of six cytokines in middle ear effusions (MEE) from children with COME. Significant levels of four cytokines: interleukin-1-beta (greater than 50 pg/ml), interleukin-2 (greater than 300 pg/ml), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (greater than 40 pg/ml), and gamma-interferon (greater than 6.25 pg/ml) were found in 51%, 54%, 63%, and 19% of MEE, respectively. In contrast, levels of a fifth cytokine, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and a sixth cytokine, interleukin-4, were undetectable. Age was observed to have a significant effect on the levels of specific cytokines. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) correlated inversely (P less than .02) with age such that the younger the child, the higher the level of IL-1 in MEE. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) correlated directly (P less than .005) with age such that the older the child, the higher the level of TNF in MEE. Children undergoing tympanostomy on multiple occasions had average MEE TNF levels (234.2 +/- 109.1 pg/mg total protein) that were nearly 14 times higher (P less than .005) than those from children undergoing their first tympanostomy (16.9 +/- 3.0 pg/mg total protein). Thus IL-1 correlated with the early stages of COME, while TNF correlated with persistence of disease. The presence of these cytokines in MEE may be responsible for the mucosal damage, bone erosion, fibrosis, and resulting hearing loss seen in some cases of COME. 
2	Duodenal-caval fistula. Duodenal-caval fistula is a rare, often lethal disease that requires prompt diagnosis and surgical correction. A case of duodenal-caval fistula due to duodenal ulceration is presented and discussed. 
2	Should urologists wear spectacles for transurethral resection of the prostate? Contamination of the eyes by irrigation fluid during transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate was assessed by measuring droplet splashes on to spectacles worn by 2 surgeons. During 30 consecutive operations, droplet splash contamination occurred during every procedure. The number of splashes increased with time. The use of spectacles during TUR will reduce the risks of eye contamination from droplet splashes and therefore the possibility of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus from infected patients. 
5	Complications of percutaneous abdominal fine-needle biopsy. Review. To determine whether the increasing use of percutaneous fine-needle biopsy of abdominal lesions is associated with an increase in serious complications, the author updated a literature search and evaluated a questionnaire (distributed among selected hospitals in the United States in 1986 and 1987) that followed up a questionnaire distributed in 1983. The updated literature review revealed a total of 24 deaths and 20 needle tract seedings. The updated questionnaire revealed five deaths after 16,381 biopsies (0.031%), whereas the previous questionnaire had shown four deaths after 63,108 biopsies (0.006%). Two similar European questionnaires revealed mortality rates of 0.008% and 0.018%, respectively. Of the total of 33 deaths, 21 involved biopsies of liver lesions; six involved pancreatic biopsies. Seventeen of the 21 deaths after liver biopsies were secondary to hemorrhage; five of the six deaths after pancreatic biopsies were due to pancreatitis. Of the 23 instances of needle tract seeding, 10 occurred after biopsies of pancreatic malignancies. The frequencies of needle tract seeding in the four questionnaires were 0.005%, 0.006%, 0.003%, and 0.009%, respectively. Although infrequent, serious complications may be associated with this procedure. The author makes suggestions that may help minimize them. 
4	Natural death as viewed by the medical examiner: a review of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease. A study of 1000 consecutive autopsies of individuals dying of natural disease was conducted. Cardiovascular disease was responsible for 60.9% of all deaths with coronary artery disease--not only the main cause of cardiovascular death but also the main cause of all natural deaths--accounting for 45.1% of such cases. Diseases of the central nervous and respiratory systems accounted for 8.7 and 8.6%, respectively, of the natural deaths. Seizure disorders and pneumonia were the main causes of death in these organ systems. There were 124 deaths of children less than one year in age, 91 of which were due to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). All of the SIDS deaths were in children less than 10 months old. 
1	Incidence and survival rates of children and young adults with osteogenic sarcoma. Gender-specific and race-specific incidence and survival rates of osteogenic sarcoma over a 14-year period are presented for persons aged 0 to 24 years from eight Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries. They were no significant gender or racial differences in age at diagnosis. There was no significant gender difference in overall incidence. Although incidence rates were slightly higher in blacks compared with whites, the difference was not significant after controlling for multiple comparisons. Females (median, 74 months) survived longer than males (median, 29 months), although this difference weakened after controlling for stage. No racial differences in survival were observed. White females survived the longest (median, 94 months), followed by black females (median, 41 months), black males (median, 34 months), and white males (median, 29 months). This striking difference in survival should be explored more fully. 
5	Laparoscopic ventrosuspensions. A review of 72 cases. Laparoscopic ventrosuspension is simple to perform after diagnostic laparoscopy. Serious postoperative complication is unlikely. However, patient follow-up over 6 months has not confirmed the usefulness of laparoscopic ventrosuspension in the management of deep dyspareunia or pelvic pain in association with a retroverted uterus. The success rate of laparoscopic ventrosuspension at 6 months varies from 18.6% to 46.5%. The prior use of a Hodge pessary does not predict the success of laparoscopic ventrosuspension. 
1	Deletion of Alu sequences in the fifth c-sis intron in individuals with meningiomas. An abnormality in the c-sis protooncogene was identified in leukocyte DNA from members of a family predisposed to the development of meningioma, and was found to be associated with the development of the tumor in those individuals. Molecular analysis of this abnormality demonstrated a deletion within the fifth intron of the c-sis gene. The normal c-sis gene has an Alu sequence in this region which includes two perfect 130 nucleotide repeated sequences separated by 5 bp. The deleted c-sis allele is missing precisely one copy of the 130 bp repeat and the intervening 5 bp. An identical deletion was also found in DNA from 1 of 13 sporadic meningiomas. 
1	Detection of duodenal gastrinomas by operative endoscopic transillumination. A prospective study. The ability of operative endoscopic transillumination of the bowel wall to detect duodenal gastrinoma was evaluated prospectively in 26 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The results were assessed by exploratory laparotomy and compared with the results of other localization techniques. Twelve duodenal gastrinomas were resected from 10 patients. Operative endoscopic transillumination detected 10 of the 12 gastrinomas, a sensitivity of 83%, which was significantly greater (P less than 0.05) than that for either preoperative imaging (25%) or intraoperative ultrasonography and palpation (42%). The sensitivity of operative endoscopic transillumination was a result of the ability to detect focal areas that did not transilluminate on the serosal side of the duodenum, and not the mucosal appearances seen through the endoscope, which were not helpful. Operative endoscopic transillumination detected gastrinomas less than 1 cm in diameter throughout the duodenum. Of the patients in this study, 39% had duodenal gastrinomas, a greater frequency than previously reported. These results indicate that operative endoscopic transillumination is the most sensitive technique yet described for detecting duodenal gastrinomas and should be performed routinely in all patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome who undergo exploratory laparotomy for cure. 
5	Does age affect outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation? We examined the relation between age and outcomes in patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Seattle, Wash. Considering all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests treated by paramedics over a recent 5-year period, 386 (27%) of 1405 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older were resuscitated and admitted to a hospital vs 474 (29%) of 1624 younger patients; 140 elderly patients (10%) were discharged alive vs 223 younger patients (14%). Of the 140 elderly patients, 112 went home and 28 went to a nursing home. Considering only patients whose initial rhythms were ventricular fibrillation, the percent of patients discharged alive was substantially higher: 120 (24%) of 493 for elderly patients and 194 (30%) of 639 for younger patients. Elderly patients can benefit from attempted resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 
5	The surgical management of children with ulcerative colitis. The old vs. the new. The authors' experience with children who have chronic ulcerative colitis was reviewed to compare their current surgical approach (ileoanal anastomosis) with earlier methods of management. Between 1960 and 1984, 137 children with chronic ulcerative colitis underwent surgery (mean duration of follow-up, 7.1 years). In 91 patients, the procedures were a total proctocolectomy with ileostomy or Kock pouch (66) or a lesser colectomy with either an ileostomy (16) or an ileorectal anastomosis (9) (group I). Forty-six patients underwent an ileoanal anastomosis procedure (group II). Children in group I were more likely to have significant preoperative loss of weight, a debilitated condition, and malnutrition. Urgent or emergency surgical intervention was required in 25 percent of patients in group I but in only 4 percent of patients in group II. Trends included 1) a younger age at operation in group II, 2) a higher mortality in group I (7.7 percent) than group II (0 percent), and 3) a higher perioperative mortality with emergency operations (23 percent) than elective procedures (1.6 percent). In group I, 98 percent of patients had an abdominal ostomy, but no patients in group II had an abdominal ostomy. The children with an ileoanal anastomosis had an average of 4.8 stools during waking hours and 1.3 stools each night. On the basis of this experience, the authors recommend use of the ileoanal anastomosis procedure in the surgical treatment of chronic ulcerative colitis in children. 
3	Borderzone hemodynamics in cerebrovascular disease. To investigate the possible existence of chronic selective hemodynamic impairment in the arterial borderzone regions of the brain, we used positron emission tomography (PET) to measure regional mean vascular transit time (rt, equal to the ratio of regional cerebral blood volume to cerebral blood flow) and regional oxygen extraction fraction (rOEF) in 32 patients with either severe internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion and 11 normal controls. Twenty-four of the patients had had TIAs or amaurosis fugax from 1 to 60 days before PET; all had normal brain CT. We used a stereotactic localization method to locate the anterior and posterior borderzone regions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory. We then calculated ratios of each borderzone to the ipsilateral MCA territory for both rt and rOEF. There was no significant difference from control ratios in any patient subgroup including those with greater than or equal to 75% stenosis or occlusion, those with or without contralateral greater than or equal to 50% stenosis, or those with abnormal hemodynamics in the MCA territory. We therefore found no evidence for selective borderzone hemodynamic impairment in this group of patients with severe carotid artery disease. 
5	Significance of magnetic resonance imaging in acute head injury. One hundred seventy-seven patients who had incurred head trauma were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients varied from those with mild injury without any focal neurological deficit to those with severe injury with post-traumatic coma. Altogether, 177 lesions were demonstrated by MRI in 123 of 177 patients within 3 days of injury using T2-weighted (SE2000/40,2000/111) and T1-weighted (IR1500/500/40) multislice sequences. In contrast, computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated 103 lesions in 90 patients. MRI was superior to CT in the diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic contusions demonstrated as a high-intensity area on T2-weighted imaging. MRI provided some information to evaluate the severity of diffuse axonal injury or to predict delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma (DTICH). 
2	Hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children. A serious hazard of undercooked beef. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is the leading cause of acute renal failure in childhood. Its incidence in North America is increasing. Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the most common infectious trigger and is spread by contaminated beef products as well as from person to person. Antibiotics or antidiarrheal medications should not be used in the treatment of E coli hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Mortality in children with the syndrome has fallen to less than 10% in North America, largely because of careful attention to nutrition, maintenance of a normal fluid and electrolyte balance, and careful monitoring. Education and emotional support of the family are important aspects of the treatment program. 
4	Patients' observations of bioprosthetic valve failure: "my heart is honking, doctor". Audible cardiac murmurs are uncommon and may indicate severe native valve dysfunction. In six patients with bioprosthetic mitral valves audible honking systolic murmurs suddenly developed. Doppler echocardiography showed characteristic striated regurgitant signals. At operation each prosthesis had torn cusps. New audible murmurs and striated Doppler signals originating from mitral bioprosthetic valves are indicators of cusp tears. Recognition of this is important because early detection of prosthetic valve dysfunction may improve subsequent surgical outcome. 
3	Inconsistent response to divalproex sodium in hemichorea/hemiballism. We report 6 patients with hemichorea/hemiballism of vascular origin who were treated with divalproex sodium (Depakote). Four of 6 responded initially. Marked improvement was seen in 2 patients only and in 1 of these hemiballism recurred despite continuing therapy. Divalproex sodium is not uniformly effective in the treatment of hemichorea/hemiballism. 
4	Does age affect outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation? We examined the relation between age and outcomes in patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Seattle, Wash. Considering all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests treated by paramedics over a recent 5-year period, 386 (27%) of 1405 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older were resuscitated and admitted to a hospital vs 474 (29%) of 1624 younger patients; 140 elderly patients (10%) were discharged alive vs 223 younger patients (14%). Of the 140 elderly patients, 112 went home and 28 went to a nursing home. Considering only patients whose initial rhythms were ventricular fibrillation, the percent of patients discharged alive was substantially higher: 120 (24%) of 493 for elderly patients and 194 (30%) of 639 for younger patients. Elderly patients can benefit from attempted resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. 
5	Value of electrophysiologic studies in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy treated with amiodarone. The relation of electrophysiologic effects of amiodarone to long-term outcome was studied in 35 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC). Indications for electrophysiologic studies were: cardiac arrest (n = 3), syncope/presyncope (n = 27) and asymptomatic ventricular tachycardia (VT) (n = 5). Twenty-eight patients (80%) had VT, 3 (9%) atrial tachycardia and 3 (9%) paroxysmal atrial fibrillation during 24-hour Holter monitoring. The studies were repeated after a total amiodarone dose of 58 +/- 122 g and during a maintenance median daily dose of 400 mg. Amiodarone abolished paroxysmal atrial arrhythmias in all 6 patients. However, it caused marked atrioventricular nodal conduction abnormality in 3 patients and heart block or marked HV interval prolongation (to greater than or equal to 100 ms) in 4 patients. Sustained VT was induced in 26 patients (74%) at baseline study and in 23 patients (66%) taking amiodarone therapy. With amiodarone, VT was no longer inducible or was more difficult to induce in 11 patients (31%), and the drug abolished VT during Holter monitoring in all patients. However, VT was easier to induce with amiodarone or was induced only with amiodarone in 18 (51%) patients. Amiodarone significantly slowed the rate of induced VT (from 248 +/- 29 to 214 +/- 37 beats/min, p less than 0.001). This was associated with a change in its morphology from polymorphic to monomorphic VT in 7 patients. During a follow up of 18 +/- 14 months (range 2 to 56), amiodarone was discontinued because of adverse effects in 8 patients (23%). 
2	Bleeding gastroesophageal varices: gastric vein embolization after partial portal decompression. Shunts that decompress the portal vein are effective in the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices. Use of large-caliber portacaval shunts, however, results in the complete decompression of the portal system and the risk of subsequent development of hepatic encephalopathy. Use of small-caliber portacaval shunts results in mild portal hypertension and less frequent hepatic encephalopathy but may increase the risk of recurrent bleeding. Thirty-three patients underwent angiography after partial decompression portacaval shunting (median trans-shunt pressures, 8 mm Hg). Embolization of residual varices, noted in 13 patients, was performed. Results included one complication with no sequelae and no bleeding a mean of 13 months after the procedure was performed. Trans-shunt embolization of esophageal varices effectively prevents bleeding varices after partial portal decompression. 
4	Antihypertensive drugs and glucose metabolism: comparison between a diuretic, a beta-blocker and felodipine, a new calcium antagonist in subjects with arterial hypertension and diabetes. Felodipine, a new antihypertensive calcium antagonist, was compared with metoprolol, a beta-blocker, and hydrochlorothiazide, a diuretic, with respect to glucose tolerance in a randomized double-blind cross-over study consisting of 11 patients, of age range 50-70 years, who had developed diabetes during antihypertensive treatment. Each treatment period lasted for 10 weeks. The blood pressure was similar irrespective of treatment. Serum glucose levels during the oral glucose tolerance test were significantly lower when the patients were treated with felodipine than when they were taking hydrochlorothiazide. Serum insulin levels appeared to decrease at an earlier stage of the test when the patients were treated with felodipine, the calcium antagonist, than with the other two antihypertensive substances, which suggests that glucose tolerance is impaired to a lesser extent during treatment with the calcium antagonist. Glucose tolerance was never completely normalized with any of the drugs tested. 
5	Endocrine function in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection. We sought to determine if failure to thrive in pediatric patients with the human immunodeficiency virus could be explained based on endocrine dysfunction. Fourteen human immunodeficiency virus-infected pediatric patients, all of whom had adequate nutritional status, underwent endocrine evaluation. Growth hormone and cortisol responses to glucagon stimulation were adequate. Despite this, eight of the 12 subjects had low somatomedin C levels. Although all patients were clinically and biochemically euthyroid, 36% (5/14) demonstrated elevated baseline and peak thyrotropin levels in response to thyroid releasing hormone, suggesting a state of compensated hypothyroidism. Although the importance of these findings is unclear, it is possible that subtle alterations of thyroid regulation may contribute to failure to thrive in some pediatric patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus and may represent a potentially correctable defect. 
5	Video display terminals and the risk of spontaneous abortion. BACKGROUND. The relation between spontaneous abortion and the use of video display terminals (VDTs) is of great public health concern. Previous investigators of this issue have reported inconsistent findings. METHODS. To determine whether electromagnetic fields emitted by VDTs are associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion, a cohort of female telephone operators who used VDTs at work was compared with a cohort of operators who did not use VDTs. To obtain reliable estimates of exposure, we determined the number of hours of VDT use per week from company records and measured electromagnetic fields at VDT workstations and, for purposes of comparison, at workstations without VDTs. Operators who used VDTs had higher abdominal exposure to very-low-frequency (15 kHz) electromagnetic fields (workstations without VDTs did not emit very-low-frequency energy). Abdominal exposure to extremely-low-frequency fields (45 to 60 Hz) was similar for both operators who used VDTs and those who did not. Among 2430 women interviewed, there were 882 pregnancies that met our criteria for inclusion in the study. RESULTS. We found no excess risk of spontaneous abortion among women who used VDTs during the first trimester of pregnancy (odds ratio = 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.63 to 1.38), and no dose-response relation was apparent when we examined the women's hours of VDT use per week (odds ratio for 1 to 25 hours per week = 1.04; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.79; odds ratio for greater than 25 hours per week = 1.00; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 1.64). There continued to be no risk associated with the use of VDTs when we accounted for multiple pregnancies, conducted separate analyses of early abortion, late abortion, and all fetal losses, or limited our analyses to spontaneous abortions for which a physician was consulted. CONCLUSIONS. The use of VDTs and exposure to the accompanying electromagnetic fields were not associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion in this study. 
4	Evaluation of the perforating veins of the lower extremity using high resolution duplex imaging. The purpose of this study was to evaluate duplex imaging as a means of assessing perforating veins in patients with longstanding venous stasis ulceration. Thirty patients with nonhealing venous stasis ulcers and twenty normal volunteers serving as controls were evaluated with a standard 8-MHz imaging probe and integrated pulsed Doppler. The internal diameter of perforating veins was measured and perforators were grouped into one of four categories based on functional criteria: competent perforator with venous flow (C); incompetent perforator with venous flow (IC); competent perforator with arteriovenous flow (C-AVC); incompetent perforator with arteriovenous flow (IC-AVC). Sixteen of the patients with ulcers were subsequently studied by ascending venography and in 11 patients, intraoperative identification of perforating veins was made during the Rob procedure. In this subset of patients the vessel was categorized as competent or incompetent regardless of flow signal. There were significant differences in mean perforator diameter between ulcer patients and normal volunteers. Duplex imaging identified 93 perforators and venography a total of 70. In all 16 extremities, duplex imaging made the diagnosis of significant perforating vein incompetence, verified by venography. Intraoperative findings demonstrated an excellent correlation with duplex imaging. We believe duplex imaging to be a promising new modality for evaluation of the perforating veins of the lower extremity. 
1	Unusual presentation of squamous cell carcinoma of the middle ear and mastoid. An unusual case of squamous cell carcinoma of the middle ear and mastoid in which syncope was a major presenting feature is reported. No such case has been reported in the literature. A possible explanation is offered. 
2	Intestinal obstruction by distension of a Foley jejunostomy catheter. Jejunostomies can be effective in permitting postoperative nutritional support, particularly in the patient with complicated gastrointestinal disease. In the case presented, however, distension of the Foley balloon catheter, used as the jejunostomy tube, led to intestinal obstruction which was not initially detected. Following radiographic identification of the problem, removal of the air from the Foley balloon allowed the patient to complete his convalescence from surgery. The possibility of obstruction from the Foley jejunostomy catheter should be recognized as a potential problem in the postoperative period. 
4	Combined alpha/beta-blockade versus beta 1-selective blockade in essential hypertension in black and white patients. The purpose of this multicenter investigation was to determine the efficacy and safety of the alpha/beta-blocker labetalol versus the beta 1-selective beta-blocker atenolol in white and black patients with essential hypertension. Equal numbers of black and white patients were enlisted to form four treatment groups (white patients taking either labetalol or atenolol and black patients taking either labetalol or atenolol). Two hundred ninety-two patients (152 white and 140 black patients) with essential hypertension characterized by a standing diastolic blood pressure of 105 to 119 mm Hg (inclusive) were recruited for this trial. Patients were randomized to either labetalol (dosage titrated from 200 to 1600 mg/day) or atenolol (dosage titrated from 50 to 100 mg/day). The therapeutic goal was achievement of a standing diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or less or a fall of 15 mm Hg in diastolic pressure from baseline value at the end of the placebo run in period. At the end of the study there were no significant differences in blood pressure or heart rate changes in the supine position between the labetalol and atenolol groups. In contrast, labetalol produced greater reduction in both the standing systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-12/-13 mm Hg, respectively) compared with atenolol (-7/-9 mm Hg; p less than 0.05; p less than 0.005, respectively). The greatest decrease in blood pressure was observed in white patients receiving labetalol. In black patients the decrease in blood pressure was greater in those treated with labetalol compared with atenolol, particularly with respect to the systolic blood pressure. We conclude that the alpha 1-blocking property of labetalol provides an additional lowering of the blood pressure over that seen with beta 1-blockade alone, especially in the standing position, and this enhanced efficacy is not confined to one radical group. 
1	Small nodular lesions in the lung periphery: new approach to diagnosis with CT. To evaluate relationships between lesions in the lung periphery and surrounding structures, particularly vessels and bronchi, axial multiplanar reconstruction (AMPR) computed tomography (CT) was used to study 26 patients who underwent surgical resection of pulmonary nodules less than 3 cm in diameter. Findings at AMPR CT, conventional CT, and digital radiographic tomography were compared with findings obtained at evaluation of the resected specimen with regard to the ability to display the relationships between vessels, bronchi, and lesions. AMPR CT was significantly superior to conventional CT and digital radiographic tomography in detecting involvement of pulmonary vessels (P less than .001). Involvement of pulmonary veins was seen in all lung cancers, whereas such involvement was seen in only one of eight nonneoplastic lesions. Thus, involvement of pulmonary veins is strongly suggestive of malignancy. AMPR CT permits three-dimensional visualization and morphologic assessment of pulmonary nodules. 
2	Plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations are correlated to bile cholesterol saturation index in the African green monkey. In an attempt to determine if plasma lipoprotein concentrations correlate with the bile cholesterol saturation index in the African green monkey, we have studied a group of adult male animals available from a long-term study investigating the effects of dietary fat and cholesterol on cholesterol metabolism and atherosclerosis. The animals were fed diets containing 0.8 mg cholesterol/kcal or 0.03 mg cholesterol/kcal for five years. Within each dietary cholesterol group, animals received 42% of dietary calories as fat, enriched with either saturated or polyunsaturated fat. Using stepwise multiple linear regression, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration was found to be the best plasma lipid predictor of the bile cholesterol saturation index. When the cholesterol saturation index of a fasting gallbladder bile specimen was compared to the plasma HDL cholesterol level for individual animals, a significant positive correlation was noted for animals fed polyunsaturated fat, (r = 0.68) and for animals fed saturated fat (r = 0.72). For any value of HDL cholesterol, however, the cholesterol saturation index was higher in animals fed polyunsaturated fat compared to saturated fat. Since plasma HDL cholesterol levels were positively correlated with the bile cholesterol saturation index in adult male African green monkeys, we conclude that a metabolic link exists between plasma HDL cholesterol concentrations and bile cholesterol saturation, perhaps due to enhanced delivery of cholesterol to the liver by HDL. 
4	Long-term follow-up of the first 56 patients treated with intracoronary self-expanding stents (the Lausanne experience). Fifty-six patients treated with the self-expanding intracoronary stent for acute occlusion during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or restenosis were followed for 24 to 43 months (mean 34). Successful deployment and positioning were achieved in 55 of 56 patients. Occlusion of the stent was documented in 8 patients, the earliest occurring 30 minutes and the latest 8 months after implantation. Three of the occluded stents were recanalized by PTCA. Coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG) were required in 4 patients: 1 for symptomatic restenosis, 1 for left main stenosis adjacent to the stent and 2 for acute ischemia during the in-hospital stay (less than 7 days). Myocardial infarction occurred in the territory of the stented vessel in 8 patients. Seven patients died between 1 day and 19 months after implantation. Local bleeding complications occurred in 10 patients, with 5 requiring blood transfusion. Restenosis within the stent was angiographically documented in 5 patients (9%). A new lesion in the treated vessel was found in 10 patients, followed by implantation of a second stent in 5 and a third stent in 1 patient. Medical treatment was instituted in the remaining 4 patients. Forty-nine patients (88%) are alive. Twenty-nine patients (51%) remained asymptomatic, and 44 (78%) are in a better functional class than before the implantation. Eleven of 15 (79%) major complications (acute occlusions or deaths) occurred in patients who received a stent in the left anterior descending coronary artery. In conclusion, implantation of the self-expanding intracoronary stent appears to be a new therapeutic option for treating acute occlusion or restenosis after PTCA. 
3	Heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease may present with severe acute hepatocellular failure. The only effective treatment for fulminant Wilson's disease is liver transplantation, which may lead to reversal of the underlying disease. Some patients with cirrhosis who are too ill to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation have been treated with heterotopic liver transplantation. However, use of heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant hepatocellular failure has not been successful. This case study involves a patient in whom a heterotopic liver transplant was successfully used for treatment of Wilson's disease presenting with fulminant hepatocellular failure. 
1	Endoscopic biopsy has limited accuracy in diagnosis of ampullary tumors. Endoscopic biopsy specimens and surgically resected specimens in a collective series of 78 Japanese patients with ampullary tumor were retrospectively reviewed to investigate the clinical implications of endoscopic biopsy. Endoscopic biopsy specimens were classified into five groups based on the degree of epithelial atypia: group 1 (no atypia), group 2 (mild atypia), group 3 (moderate atypia or adenoma), group 4 (severe atypia or carcinoma in situ), and group 5 (invasive carcinoma). Final diagnosis of the 78 resected ampullary tumors was adenoma in five cases, carcinoma in 27 cases, and both adenoma and carcinoma in 46 cases. Biopsy accuracy of carcinoma (group 4 or 5) was 70% (51 of 73) overall in 73 carcinoma cases. Biopsy accuracy was 50% (7 of 14) in the intramural protruding type, 64% (21 of 33) in the exposed protruding type, and 88% (23 of 26) in the ulcerating type. The diagnostic accuracy of adenoma (group 3) was 80% (4 of 5) in five cases of ampullary adenoma. In 18 (25%) of the 73 carcinoma cases, biopsy diagnosis was adenoma (group 3), whereas carcinoma was found in the deeper layers of surgically resected specimens. Biopsy diagnosis of adenoma does not rule out the possibility of deeper carcinoma in ampullary tumors. 
5	Eosinophilic fasciitis associated with tryptophan ingestion. A manifestation of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Recently, the ingestion of tryptophan has been associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is characterized by eosinophilia, myalgias, and several less consistently reported findings. We treated 13 patients who exhibited clinical features of eosinophilic fasciitis who were taking high-dose tryptophan before the onset of clinical symptoms. Twelve patients exhibited eosinophilia, with eosinophil counts ranging from 0.13 to 0.88. The remaining patient was taking oral corticosteroids when her eosinophil count was determined. Eight patients complained of myalgias. Other symptoms included arthralgias, pruritus, cutaneous burning, weakness, fever, rashes, malaise, edema, muscle spasms, and alopecia. 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels were elevated in four of the eight urine specimens that were tested. Our findings suggest that previously diagnosed cases of eosinophilic fasciitis may represent variants of tryptophan-associated eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Derangements in the metabolism of tryptophan may play a role in sclerotic diseases. 
1	Ultrasound in the investigation of the right iliac fossa mass. Patients presenting with a right iliac fossa (RIF) mass are a diagnostic problem. The objective of this study was to assess the role of ultrasound (US) in their investigation. A prospective series of 50 patients presenting with a clinically suspected RIF mass was examined by US and the finding correlated with the final diagnosis. There was a positive finding in 34 patients (68%). Ultrasound correctly identified the organ of origin in 33 (97%) and was able to guide the patients' further management. In 12 cases no abnormality was found in the RIF, of which 11 had no positive findings at follow-up and one was shown to have an unrelated abnormality at laparotomy. In four cases the findings were due to normal variants. Ultrasound is the imaging modality of first choice in patients presenting with a RIF mass. 
1	Fine-needle aspiration in hepatocellular carcinoma. Combined cytologic and histologic approach. Cytologic features of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have not been well documented. Most previous reports described only the the morphologic features of the tumor cells without considering the sinusoidal stroma. Cytohistologic correlation on tissue from the same aspirate has rarely been done. This report describes the cytologic patterns of 50 cases of HCC in terms of histologic pattern observed in cell blocks prepared from the same aspiration specimen and classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Tumors were classified according to the predominant pattern. Thirty-two cases gave the trabecular pattern. Smears could be subdivided into a central-sinusoidal pattern (23 cases) and a peripheral-sinusoidal pattern (nine cases). One case gave the pseudoglandular pattern. Seventeen cases gave the compact pattern with inconspicuous sinusoids. In all cases sinusoids were easily recognized in cell block sections. Other cytologic features such as intranuclear cytoplasmic inclusions, eosinophilic globules, and bile secretion could be seen in both smears and cell blocks. Mallory's hyalin and ground glass inclusions were only recognized in cell blocks. More attention should be paid to the sinusoidal stroma for diagnosis of HCC in FNA; cell blocks should be more widely utilized to this effect; cytologic patterns could be classified according to the WHO histologic classification. 
2	Gastrointestinal dysfunction and disaccharide intolerance in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Because gastrointestinal dysfunction is a major problem in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we utilized breath hydrogen measurements to determine the relationship between disaccharide malabsorption and gastrointestinal dysfunction in HIV-infected children. We found a strong association between lactose intolerance and persistent diarrheal disease in this population (p less than 0.007, Mann-Whitney U test). We also found evidence of sucrose malabsorption and persistent diarrheal disease in three of the children. Extensive microbiologic evaluations failed to reveal an etiologic agent related to the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Our findings indicate that disaccharide intolerance is a common occurrence in HIV-infected children with persistent diarrheal disease. Careful attention to dietary intake may be required to ameliorate clinical symptoms and to maintain adequate nutrition. 
1	Etoposide in acute leukemia. Past experience and future perspectives. Etoposide as a single agent is active in relapsed and refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), with complete responses (CR) rates of 10% to 25%. The drug has been safely combined with cytarabine, azacytidine, vinca alkaloids, and anthracyclines, inducing remission rates of 20% to 60% in patients with previously treated AML. The experience with etoposide in acute lymphoblastic leukemia is less extensive, but the drug seems to be active in combination with cytarabine or aclacinomycin. In addition, etoposide is combined with cytarabine and anthracyclines for the primary treatment of AML. The response rates thus achieved are comparable with those obtained with standard regimens. A Phase I/II trial was initiated to study the efficacy of the NOVE combination (mitoxantrone [10 mg/m2/d, days 1 to 5] plus etoposide [100 mg/m2/d for 3, 4, or 5 days] in patients with refractory AML. The results showed that extended duration of etoposide administration is associated with higher CR rates. Overall, a CR rate of 43% was achieved in 61 patients. A sequential regimen with IDAC (idarubicin/cytarabine) and NOVE was designed for primary treatment of adult patients with AML. Cycles of IDAC or NOVE are applied depending on response. The results of the pilot study with this strategy were encouraging with 18 of 20 patients achieving CR. Further studies are under way to verify the efficacy of this strategy. 
1	Conservative surgery and radiation therapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the wrist, hand, ankle, and foot. Seventy-eight patients with soft tissue sarcoma (STS) arising in the distal extremities--wrist, hand, finger, ankle, foot, and toe--who were treated with conservation surgery and radiation therapy were studied retrospectively with respect to survival, local recurrence, functional limb preservation, complications, and distant metastasis. After a median follow-up of 7.9 years, actuarial 5-year and 10-year survival rates were 80% and 69%, respectively, and disease-free rates were 61% and 51% at the same times. Actuarial local control rates were 80% and 74% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Fifteen patients (19%) had local recurrence, but 12 of these were salvaged. Ultimately, 53 patients (68%) retained a normal or fairly normal extremity, six (8%) needed amputation for complications, and 13 (17%) needed amputation to control recurrent disease. The functional outcome was significantly better for patients with upper extremity lesions than for those with lower extremity tumors; even for the latter, this treatment strategy was preferable to amputation. The incidence of hematogenous metastases from distal extremity sarcomas depends on the size of the primary tumor. It was concluded that conservation surgery and radiation therapy (XRT) is an acceptable treatment strategy for STS arising in distal extremities; it yielded a high rate of disease control and functional limb preservation. 
3	Propofol infusion for control of status epilepticus. Two patients with status epilepticus who were resistant to conventional treatment but responded to propofol infusions are reported. An electroencephalogram confirmed the seizures and their successful treatment. 
1	MHC-restricted recognition of autologous melanoma by tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells. Evidence for restriction by a dominant HLA-A allele. Autologous melanoma-specific CTL recognize a common tumor-associated Ag (TAA) in the context of HLA class I antigens. We have demonstrated that HLA-A2 can be a restricting Ag and, in T cell lines homozygous for HLA-A2, that CTL can be generated by stimulation with HLA-A2 allogeneic melanomas. In the current study, we have investigated T cell lines from patients who are heterozygous at HLA-A region locus, to determine the relative importance of each A-region allele in this MHC-restricted recognition of tumor. We have shown that HLA-A1 can be a restricting Ag, and that allogeneic melanomas expressing HLA-A1 can substitute for the autologous tumor in the generation of HLA-A1-restricted CTL. However, when T cell lines express both HLA-A1 and HLA-A2, the HLA-A2 allele governed restriction of the melanoma TAA. Three autologous-stimulated HLA-A1, A2 CTL lines all demonstrated restriction by the HLA-A2 allele, when examined in cytotoxicity assays, cold-competition assays, and proliferation assays. There was no evidence of restriction by the second HLA-allele, HLA-A1. Although the autologous-stimulated CTL use a single A-region allele for tumor recognition, the autologous HLA-A1, A2 tumors are lysed by both HLA-A1-restricted and HLA-A2-restricted CTL. The dominance of restricting alleles was further demonstrated when HLA-matched allogeneic melanomas were used as the stimulating tumor to generate tumor-specific CTL. Stimulation of the heterozygous (HLA-A1, A2) lymphocytes with HLA-A2-matched allogeneic melanomas resulted in CTL specific for the autologous tumor, and restricted by the HLA-A2 Ag. However, stimulation with an HLA-A1-matched allogeneic melanoma failed to induce tumor-specific CTL restricted by the HLA-A1 Ag. The data suggest there is a dominance of HLA-A region Ag at the level of the T cell, such that only one is restricting in the recognition of the autologous melanoma. At the level of the tumor, however, the TAA is expressed in the context of both HLA-A region alleles. We can generate specific CTL from lymph node cells or PBL and HLA-A region matched allogeneic melanomas; however, because most patients are heterozygous at the HLA-A region locus, an understanding of the dominant restricting alleles must be obtained so that an appropriately matched allogeneic melanoma can be selected. 
5	Successful treatment of metastatic thymic carcinoma with cisplatin, vinblastine, bleomycin, and etoposide chemotherapy. Thymic carcinomas are rare malignant neoplasms of the thymic epithelium that are distinguished from the malignant thymomas by the presence of cytologic atypia. Thymic carcinomas may metastasize outside of the thorax and are associated with a very poor prognosis. Complete responses of thymic carcinoma to chemotherapy alone have not been reported. A 21-year-old man with metastatic undifferentiated carcinoma of probable thymic origin is presented who achieved a pathologic complete response with cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin chemotherapy. Additional consolidative chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide was administered. The patient remains disease-free 5 years after diagnosis. Cisplatin, vinblastine, and bleomycin chemotherapy appears to have significant activity against thymic carcinoma. 
2	Adverse mortality experience of a southwestern American Indian community: overall death rates and underlying causes of death in Pima Indians. As part of an ongoing epidemiologic study, the death rate and causes of death during 1975 through 1984 were determined in Pima Indians who resided in the Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) in 1965 and later. Death certificates were available for 677 of the 681 deaths. In 78% of the deaths, the underlying cause recorded on the death certificate agreed with the cause determined after review of all available relevant records. The age- and sex-adjusted average annual death rate for the GRIC population (1639/100,000) was 1.9 times (95% CI 1.7-2.0) the 1980 rate for the U.S. all races (878/100,000). In Pima males, whose death rate was substantially higher than that of Pima females, the age-adjusted death rate was 2.3 times that in U.S. males, all races. Moreover among males 25-34 years of age, the Pima death rate was 6.6 times that for the U.S. all races. Diseases of the heart and malignant neoplasms caused 59% of U.S. deaths in 1980, but only 19% of GRIC deaths. By contrast, the age- and sex-adjusted mortality rate in the GRIC Pima was 5.9 times the rate of the U.S. all races for accidents, 6.5 times for cirrhosis, 7.4 times for homicide, 4.3 times for suicide, and 11.9 times for diabetes. Tuberculosis and coccidioidomycosis were important causes of death in the Pima, for whom infectious diseases was the tenth leading cause of death. The findings indicate that programs to improve the adverse mortality experience of the GRIC population should emphasize factors related to fatal accidents, alcoholic cirrhosis, homicide, suicide, diabetes mellitus, and infectious diseases. Young Pimas, especially the males, should be the primary focus of such preventive efforts. These findings and recommendations probably apply to many Native American populations. 
4	Myocardial uptake of carbon-11-acetate as an indirect estimate of regional myocardial blood flow. The rate of clearance of myocardial carbon-11 (11C) activity (after the administration of 11C-acetate) has been shown to correlate closely with myocardial oxygen consumption. In the present study, we hypothesized that regional net myocardial uptake of 11C-acetate, which reflects primarily delivery and extraction of tracer, would be markedly flow-dependent and potentially useful as an indirect index of regional myocardial blood flow. In 22 patients with stable coronary artery disease, the regional distribution of early net uptake of 11C-acetate was correlated with estimates of regional myocardial blood flow assessed with oxygen-15-water. The myocardial images of 11C-acetate uptake were of high quality. The correlation between the two approaches was close (r = 0.88) and not affected by the metabolic state of the tissue. Thus, in patients with stable coronary artery disease, under resting conditions, direct estimates of myocardial oxygen consumption in relation to the level of delivery of tracer to the tissue can now be obtained by PET with use of a single radiopharmaceutical, 11C-acetate. This approach may prove particularly useful in streamlining clinical protocols designed to assess myocardial oxygen consumption. 
3	Neurologic complications of cocaine abuse. The neurologic complications of cocaine toxicity are responsible for a major portion of the morbidity and mortality associated with cocaine. Most of the complications appear to be related to the hyperadrenergic state induced by cocaine and may be treated symptomatically. Diazepam is the most effective drug for cocaine-induced seizures. 
1	Interphase cytogenetics using biotin and digoxigenin labelled probes: III. Increased sensitivity and flexibility for detecting HPV in cervical biopsy specimens and cell lines. A monoclonal antibody to digoxin enabled sandwich techniques to be used for the detection of hybridised digoxigenin labelled probes in cultured cells and paraffin wax sections. This system has greater flexibility than alkaline phosphatase conjugated polyclonal antidigoxigenin antibody and permits the use of alternative detector enzymes, such as horseradish peroxidase and fluorescence labels. The APAAP detection system that does not require the use of biotin can also be used in situations where endogenous biotin is a problem. The low level of background staining combined with precise substrate deposition of the amplified peroxidase system gives higher sensitivity and resolution. This permits localisation of closely adjacent chromosomal loci in interphase nuclei. The most sensitive peroxidase based digoxigenin detection system visualises two and a half to 12 copies of human papillomavirus (HPV) per nucleus. This system is also suitable for the analysis of low copy number HPV infection of cervical tissues. 
2	Endometriosis. An important condition in clinical gastroenterology. Endometriosis, a condition defined by the presence of ectopic endometrium, is a disorder of increasing incidence and a significant cause of gastroenterologic distress in young women. Although clinical manifestations vary considerably depending upon the anatomic extent of disease, characteristic abdominal complaints and typical physical findings continue to be associated with misdiagnosis and delayed recognition of gastrointestinal involvement. The authors of this paper review the medical literature concerning endometriosis of the digestive tract--emphasizing modes of presentation, risk factors, diagnostic testing, complications, and therapy. Greater familiarity with the disease and heightened awareness of its sequellae are needed and prerequisite to improved medical management. 
5	Pregnancy complicated by preeclampsia-eclampsia with the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count: how rapid is postpartum recovery? The rapidity of postpartum disease recovery for severe preeclampsia associated with hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP syndrome) has not been well studied. Between January 1980 and March 1989, 158 pregnancies with preeclampsia-eclampsia complicated by HELLP syndrome were managed at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. The 70 patients with platelet nadir below 50,000/microL (class 1 HELLP syndrome) required as long as 11 days for all members to achieve a platelet recovery concentration of more than 100,000/microL, whereas all 88 gravidas with platelet nadir between 50,000-100,000/microL (class 2 HELLP syndrome) exceeded this platelet concentration by the sixth postpartum day, a statistically significant difference (P less than .0001). The interval between delivery and the onset of diuresis (mean +/- SD) was significantly longer in class 1 than in class 2 patients with milder disease (22.7 +/- 18.9 compared with 15.9 +/- 11.1 hours). Significantly more postpartum days were required in class 1 than in class 2 HELLP parturients for the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration to decrease below 500 IU/L (4.2 +/- 4.9 compared with 3.2 +/- 2.7 days). No women in the class 2 group required plasma exchange therapy to effect disease arrest and reversal, but 11 of 58 severely ill women in class 1 were treated with this modality. We conclude that the platelet count and LDH serum concentration, as indicators of HELLP severity and recovery, are clinically useful tools and that a more protracted postpartum recovery period should be expected for progressively severe expressions of HELLP syndrome. 
5	Refractory parastomal ulcers: a multidisciplinary approach. Chronic parastomal ulcers in patients with ileostomy or colostomy stomas are unusual. Previous reports have implicated infections, fistulas, recurrent inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), pyoderma gangrenosum, and trauma. Over the past 8 years we have evaluated 10 cases of such refractory parastomal ulcers that occurred at a mean of 11 years after stomal surgery. Eight patients had had an ileostomy for IBD while two had undergone colostomy for colon cancer. Five patients with IBD were diagnosed as having pyoderma gangrenosum ulcerations. They required systemic treatment for a mean of 25 weeks to effect ulcer healing. The other five patients had either parastomal ulcers on the basis of dermatoses (contact dermatitis, eczema, or bullous pemphigoid) or contact ulcers due to face-plate pressure and parastomal dermatitis. These patients received topical treatment with healing of ulcers in a mean of 4 weeks. We conclude that parastomal ulcers occurring in patients without IBD or IBD patients without classic pyoderma gangrenosum require early dermatologic evaluation as they respond relatively quickly to appropriate local therapy. 
1	Evidence that tumor necrosis factor plays a pathogenetic role in the paraneoplastic syndromes of cachexia, hypercalcemia, and leukocytosis in a human tumor in nude mice. Recently, we have established a human squamous cell carcinoma of the maxilla (called MH-85) associated with hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, and cachexia in culture. MH-85 tumor cells caused the same paraneoplastic syndromes in tumor-bearing nude mice. We found that there was a sixfold increase in splenic size in MH-85 tumor-bearing mice. This increase paralleled tumor growth and was reversed by surgical removal of the tumor. Splenectomy in nude mice 1 wk before or 6 wk after tumor inoculation resulted in a decrease in tumor growth, and impairment of hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, and cachexia. In MH-85 tumor-bearing animals that had been pretreated by splenectomy, intravenous injection of fresh normal spleen cells caused an immediate reversal of leukocytosis, hypercalcemia, and cachexia. Since the presence of cachexia in both the patient and the mice carrying the tumor suggested tumor necrosis factor (TNF) may be overproduced, we injected polyclonal neutralizing antibodies raised against murine TNF into tumor-bearing mice. There was a rapid and reproducible decrease in blood ionized calcium, accompanied by suppression of osteoclast activity. No changes in blood ionized calcium were seen in mice injected with normal immune sera. In addition, there was an increase in body weight and decrease in white cell count. Plasma immunoreactive TNF was increased almost fourfold in tumor-bearing nude mice compared with control nude mice. Although TNF activity was undetectable in MH-85 culture supernatants, cells of the macrophage lineage, including spleen cells, released increased amounts of TNF when cultured with MH-85 tumor-conditioned media. These results suggest that splenic cytokines such as TNF may influence the development of the paraneoplastic syndromes of hypercalcemia, leukocytosis, and cachexia in these animals, as well as tumor growth. They also show that paraneoplastic syndromes may be due to factors produced by normal host cells stimulated by the presence of the tumor. 
5	Host response to mycobacterial infection in the alcoholic rat. Animals, chronically treated with alcohol, were inoculated with mycobacteria (bacillus Calmette-Guerin, 10.2 x 10(6) organisms) into the spleen to produce a granulomatous hepatitis. Before infection, chronic alcohol ingestion was associated with a depressed skin test response to phytohemagglutinin, 71.7% of baseline (P = 0.009). Mycobacterial (bacillus Calmette-Guerin) infection stimulated phytohemagglutinin skin test response to 417% of baseline in controls and 299% in alcoholics (P less than 0.001). The hepatic granuloma response was altered with smaller but more numerous granulomas (mean +/- SEM, 81.2 +/- 1.5 microns2 of area with a frequency of 1.8 granulomas per field in alcoholics vs. 129.8 +/- 5.71 microns2 and 1.2 granulomas per field in controls; P less than 0.001). These changes were associated with a 10-fold increase in colony-forming units per gram of liver (54.5 +/- 18.2 in alcoholics vs. 5.6 +/- 1.83 in controls; P = 0.0006). This model offers precise parameters for host response to infection and indicates that alcohol significantly impairs the clearing capacity for mycobacteria from the liver. 
5	A hepatocellular carcinoma of massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain treated with CDDP two-route chemotherapy--a case report. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor vessels or tumor stain are sometimes encountered in advanced cases of liver cirrhosis. Massive arterioportal shunts without tumor stain that responded well to intensive chemotherapy with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II are reported. 
2	Sexually transmitted diseases of the colon, rectum, and anus. The challenge of the nineties. During the past two decades, an explosive growth in both the prevalence and types of sexually transmitted diseases has occurred. Up to 55 percent of homosexual men with anorectal complaints have gonorrhea; 80 percent of the patients with syphilis are homosexuals. Chlamydia is found in 15 percent of asymptomatic homosexual men, and up to one third of homosexuals have active anorectal herpes simplex virus. In addition, a host of parasites, bacterial, viral, and protozoan are all rampant in the homosexual population. Furthermore, the global epidemic of AIDS has produced a plethora of colorectal manifestations. Acute cytomegalovirus ileocolitis is the most common indication for emergency abdominal surgery in the homosexual AIDS population. Along with cryptosporidia and isospora, the patient may present to the colorectal surgeon with bloody diarrhea and weight loss before the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. Other patients may present with colorectal Kaposi's sarcoma or anorectal lymphoma, and consequently will be found to have seropositivity for HIV. However, in addition to these protean manifestations, one third of patients with AIDS consult the colorectal surgeon with either condylomata acuminata, anorectal sepsis, or proctitis before the diagnosis of HIV disease. Although aggressive anorectal surgery is associated with reasonable surgical results in some asymptomatic HIV positive patients, the same procedures in AIDS (symptomatic HIV positive) patients will often be met with disastrous results. It is incumbent upon the surgeon, therefore, to recognize the manifestations of HIV disease and diagnose these conditions accordingly. 
3	Tourette syndrome: recent advances. Clinical and genetic studies have allowed the limits of Tourette syndrome to be broadened. There is now strong evidence that chronic motor tics and Tourette syndrome are different manifestations of an autosomal dominant gene with high penetrance. A genetic link with obsessive-compulsive disorder also appears to have been established. Up to 10% of cases of Tourette syndrome may be nongenetic phenocopies, however. There is also an association between Tourette syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This complicates therapy, as psychostimulant drugs may precipitate or exacerbate tics in some individuals. A high proportion of patients with Tourette syndrome also has neuropsychological deficits and learning disabilities. The pathophysiology is incompletely understood. The best supported hypothesis is that there is dopamine receptor supersensitivity, although there are strong suggestions of abnormalities in serotonin metabolism. The possibility of abnormalities in neuropeptide systems is being explored. Treatment of tics relies primarily on neuroleptics with dopamine receptor blocking activity. Clonidine may be useful in some patients, especially those with behavior problems. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms can be treated using appropriate pharmacologic agents. The treatment of attention deficit disorder in patients with tics should begin with behavioral strategies. Clonidine can be tried as the first-line drug, and psychostimulants should be used only if necessary and with great caution. In rare instances it may be necessary to combine a psychostimulant and a neuroleptic. 
5	Antibody coated bacteria in urine of patients with recent spinal injury. Twenty patients with an acute spinal injury were prospectively studied to assess the clinical importance of antibody coated bacteria (ACB) in the urine and the association among the different bacterial species with a positive antibody coated bacteria test. Clinical urinary tract infection was associated with a positive ACB test on 45% of occasions. Three hundred and ninety nine urine samples containing 541 bacterial isolates were assessed for the presence of ACB; 13% were found to be positive and 87% negative for ACB; 67% of urines contained a single bacterial isolate. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most commonly associated with clinical urinary tract infection, found in 25% of episodes, followed by Proteus mirabilis (17.5%), Klebsiella sp (12.5%), and Proteus morganii (10%). Providencia stuartii, however, was most commonly associated with a positive ACB test (found in 17%). Other bacteria associated with a positive ACB test included Klebsiella sp (14%), Acinetobacter sp (12.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Citrobacter sp (11.5%). A positive ACB test is not to be expected from a patient with spinal injury who has a catheter in place, and the test may provide a useful guide to identify those patients with an invasive infection. It is doubtful that a decision to treat or not treat bacteriuria could rest on the identification of the bacterial species alone. 
2	The role of continued drinking in loss of portal perfusion after distal splenorenal shunt. Fifty percent of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who undergo distal splenorenal shunting for variceal bleeding lose portal perfusion within 1 year. Although it was previously considered that this loss of portal flow was irrevocable, the present study shows that with resolution of alcoholic hepatitis, portal perfusion can be restored. A 34-year-old patient with alcoholic liver disease and a distal splenorenal shunt lost portal perfusion 1 year after the operation. He had continued to drink alcohol and had high sinusoidal pressure. Following forced abstinence over the next 2 years, his sinusoidal pressure fell, liver volume decreased, results of liver biopsy improved, and portal perfusion was restored. Shunt patency was documented, and the same collaterals from the portal vein to the shunt could still be visualized as had been seen when portal flow was absent. Restoration of portal perfusion was attributed to decreased intrahepatic resistance secondary to abstinence from alcohol. A return to drinking in the next 9 months led to alcoholic hepatitis and once again loss of portal perfusion. This study places emphasis on increased intrahepatic resistance rather than the development of portal-to-shunt collaterals as important in the loss of portal flow in such patients. 
1	Pregnancy after in vitro fertilization in a patient with stage I endometrial carcinoma treated with progestins. A 35-year-old woman with chronic anovulation and bilateral tubal disease was found during infertility evaluation to have grade I endometrial carcinoma confined to an endometrial polyp. She was treated with polypectomy and endometrial curettage followed by high-dose progestagens for 6 months. Endometrial curettage at 3 and 6 months of therapy indicated regression of the lesion and the patient subsequently achieved successful pregnancy with IVF. 
3	Radial tunnel syndrome. An investigation of compression neuropathy as a possible cause. Conventional electromyographic and nerve-conduction studies usually do not show abnormalities in patients who have a clinical diagnosis of radial tunnel syndrome. Therefore, posterior interosseous nerve-conduction measurements were performed during forced supination in patients who had this syndrome. Only one of sixteen patients had a major increase in latency. Our data do not support the hypothesis that the signs and symptoms in most patients who have a diagnosis of radial tunnel syndrome are caused by compression of the posterior interosseous nerve. 
1	Establishment and characterization of unique cell lines (KCC-1a and KCC-1b) from endometrial adenocarcinoma with clear cell carcinoma presenting unusual karyotypes and estrogen secretion. Human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell lines (KCC-1a and KCC-1b) were established from a resected endometrial carcinoma of a 67-year-old woman. The original tumor showed the bimorphic patterns of tubular adenocarcinoma and clear cell carcinoma. The cell lines have been maintained for 50 months through 100 passages. The doubling time of KCC-1a was 87 hours, whereas that of KCC-1b was 144 hours. The number of chromosomes of KCC-1a distributed in a range from 33 to 79, whereas that of KCC-1b distributed in a range from 64 to 82 (mode, 76). Functionally, both KCC-1a and KCC-1b cells showed the productions of estrone (E1) and estradiol (E2) but not estriol (E3) or progesterone (P). These cells grown in a serum-free medium secreted E1 (KCC-1a, 13.6 pg/ml; KCC-1b, 9.5 pg/ml) and E2 (10.5 pg/ml, 9.5 pg/ml) at passage 40. Neither KCC-1a nor KCC-1b cells contained estrogen or progesterone receptors. Tumor markers--alpha-fetoprotein, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 125, and CA 19-9--were not detected. Both KCC-1a and KCC-1b cells produced tumors in nude mice xenografts. Histologically, the tumors of KCC-1a cells were clear cell carcinoma, whereas those of KCC-1b cells were tubular adenocarcinoma. These findings suggest that KCC-1a and KCC-1b cells will provide useful information to clarify the histogenesis of endometrial carcinoma combined with clear cell carcinoma. 
4	Pathophysiological insights into the cardiomyopathy of Chagas' disease. The evidence gained from both human and animal studies of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy suggests that the disease occurs as a consequence of several discrete and progressive pathophysiological processes occurring after infection, the ultimate expression of which depends on a host of unidentified factors. Collectively, the infection-associated events compromise microvasculature function and result in hypoperfusion, with consequences indistinguishable from those observed in other, nonparasitological cardiomyopathic diseases secondary to hypoperfusion. Therefore, chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy may share similar pathophysiological abnormalities with other chronic congestive cardiomyopathic states. 
1	Lymphokine-activated killer cell suppressor factor in malignant effusions. We examined the possibility that tumor-released products inhibit lymphokine-activated killer cell activation. Lymphokine-activated killer cells from human peripheral blood lymphocytes were activated with recombinant interleukin 2 for 4 days in the presence of malignant effusions or conditioned media from cultured cell lines (10% vol/vol). Eight of 10 malignant effusions/media suppressed the induction of lymphokine-activated killer cell cytotoxicity, as measured in a 4-hour sodium chromate release assay. Seven of 10 effusions/media inhibited lymphokine-activated killer cell proliferation. Suppression was both dose and time dependent. A representative suppressive effusion was fractionated by agarose gel chromatography, treated with detergents disruptive of ionic bonds and lipids, and refractionated using polyacrylamide gel chromatography. Seven suppressive fractions ranging in molecular weight from 1 x 10(5) to 3 x 10(5) d were isolated. It is speculated that this suppressor factor may represent a large multimeric structure with ionic-bonded individual suppressive components. 
1	Fine-needle aspiration for diagnosis of intranodal squamous-cell carcinoma metastatic from the skin. Fine-needle aspiration is a useful way to determine the presence of squamous-cell carcinoma in enlarged lymph nodes of patients at high risk for metastases. Advantages include a high degree of accuracy, outpatient as well as inpatient availability, and negligible potential for seeding of malignant cells. Cutaneous oncologists should consider using this technique in patients with lymphadenopathy and a previous history of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. 
3	Loss of chromosome 22 alleles in human sporadic spinal schwannomas. Acoustic neuromas occur either as sporadic solitary tumors in the general population or as inherited bilateral tumors typically in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2. Loss of heterozygosity for markers on the long arm of chromosome 22 has been reported in both instances, and neurofibromatosis type 2 has been genetically linked to a marker on the long arm of this autosome, suggesting that a unique locus on chromosome 22 is implicated in tumorigenesis of both sporadic and inherited acoustic neuromas. To determine whether the locus for neurofibromatosis type 2 might also be responsible for tumorigenesis of those schwannomas distinct from acoustic neuromas in people without neurofibromatosis type 2, we studied the DNA content of three sporadic spinal schwannomas. In all three, we found loss of heterozygosity for at least three markers on the long arm of chromosome 22, indicating a partial or total monosomy 22 in the tumor. Our results suggest that a locus on chromosome 22 is responsible for tumorigenesis in schwann cells regardless of their location in the central nervous system, and that some other mechanism (genetic or nongenetic) might account for the relative high proportion of schwannomas developing from the eighth cranial nerve. 
2	Piezoelectric lithotripsy and soft tissue injury. Safety limits in the experimental and clinical setting. Controversy surrounds the capacity of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy to cause soft tissue injury. This study examines the influence of different dosages of shock waves on the gall bladder in both humans and an animal model. Sixty one guinea pigs were divided into groups and subjected to different numbers of shock waves (6,000, 24,000, and 48,000) at different frequencies (2.5, 5.0, 10, 20 shock waves per second) and sacrificed at different intervals. Soft tissue damage after lithotripsy seemed to be related to the number of shock waves administered. In addition, repeated administration of low dose lithotripsy (at weekly intervals for six weeks) did not seem to produce a cumulative injury. Finally, in the animals sacrificed one month after receiving high dose lithotripsy, no soft tissue damage was evident, indicating satisfactory healing. Thirty patients were subjected to either high dose (36,000 shock waves) or low dose (6,000 shock waves) lithotripsy 24 hours before elective cholecystectomy. Both macroscopic and microscopic evidence of soft tissue injury were detected in a significantly higher percentage of patients who received a high dose in a single treatment (p less than 0.05). The group who received repeated low dose lithotripsy showed no evidence of cumulative injury. We conclude that low dose lithotripsy produces minimal soft tissue injury and is safe when repeated up to six times at weekly intervals. 
4	Disseminated histoplasmosis with embolic endovascular complications: a case report. A 57-year-old man had subacute embolic ischemia of his right foot and subsequent acute embolic ischemia of his left foot after angiography. Thrombus removed at the time of the left femoral thromboembolectomy grew Histoplasma capsulatum confirming the diagnosis of disseminated histoplasmosis. Surgical revascularization of the right leg and parenteral amphotericin B was followed by chronic ketoconazole therapy for 16 months. The patient has remained asymptomatic at 30 months after operation. Effective treatment of endovascular infection with ischemic complications of Histoplasmosis requires surgical revascularization and intensive chemotherapeutic intervention. Histoplasmosis is a ubiquitous infection in endemic areas that often has an asymptomatic subclinical course. Involvement of the cardiovascular system is rarely reported. Previous case reports have described infected cardiac valves and aortic aneurysms. This report describes the uncommon presentation of disseminated Histoplasma capsulatum infection as a peripheral embolic event and the successful management with revascularization combined with systemic amphotericin B followed by ketoconazole therapy. 
5	Anomalies of intestinal rotation in childhood: analysis of 447 cases. This report concerns 447 infants and children with anomalies of rotation and fixation. Patients were placed in four groups based on initial symptoms. Group A involved 18 patients with acute midgut volvulus. At laparotomy, midgut volvulus was noted and reduction of midgut volvulus and a Ladd procedure were performed in 10 cases and resection was required in 8. There were five deaths (28%). Group B included 54 children with chronic symptoms of intermittent volvulus or duodenal obstruction. Group C involved 44 cases of malrotation observed during exploration for other disorders. Patients in groups B and C underwent a Ladd procedure and appendectomy. There were five unrelated deaths. Group D included 331 neonates with malrotation caused by either diaphragmatic hernia (n = 111) or abdominal wall defects (n = 220). A Ladd procedure was performed on 48 patients with abdominal wall defects and 29 surviving children with diaphragmatic hernia. Only 2 of 172 (1.2%) patients with abdominal wall defects and 1 of 34 (2.9%) patients with diaphragmatic hernia not treated for malrotation had midgut volvulus. Midgut volvulus is more common in infants and is associated with a high mortality rate (28%). Patients with malrotation and chronic obstructive symptoms or those observed during other elective procedures should undergo a Ladd procedure because of the risk of midgut volvulus. The risk of midgut volvulus is low in patients with abdominal wall defects and, probably as a result of adhesions from previous neonatal operations. 
3	Clonidine treatment of Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. The safety and effectiveness of clonidine hydrochloride (3 to 5 micrograms/kg per day) were evaluated in 47 subjects with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome, aged 7 to 48 years. Twenty-four subjects were randomly assigned to clonidine treatment and 23 to placebo. Forty subjects (21 given clonidine and 19 placebo) successfully completed the 12-week, double-blind clinical trial. Clinical ratings of tic severity improved for both groups. The magnitude of response was greater in the group receiving clonidine. Clinician-rated measures of motor tic severity, the degree to which the tics are "noticeable to others," motor tic counts from videotaped interviews, and parent-rated measures of impulsivity and hyperactivity were the most responsive to clonidine treatment. These results indicate that clonidine is more effective than placebo in reducing some of the tic and other behavioral symptoms associated with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. 
3	Treatment of flexor tenosynovitis of the hand ('trigger finger') with corticosteroids. A prospective study of the response to local injection. We developed a protocol to maximize medical therapy for "trigger finger." Fifty-eight patients with 77 episodes of flexor tenosynovitis of the hand that was resistant to rest, therapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and/or splinting were treated with single or multiple injections of depo-methylprednisolone acetate or triamcinolone acetonide. Patients were prospectively followed up for an average of 4.6 years. Results showed that symptoms and signs resolved in 61% after a single injection. Recurrent episodes, after prolonged pain-free intervals, occurred in 27% and were effectively re-treated with injection. In 12% of cases, either injection failed or early recurrence required surgical release. Local adverse reactions to injection, including pain at the injection site, stiffness, ecchymosis, or atrophy of subcutaneous fat, were self-limited. No episodes of postinjection infection or tendon rupture occurred. The medical management of flexor tenosynovitis with local corticosteroid injection(s) is effective in nearly 90% of cases and is free from serious adverse reactions. 
4	Fistulas between the aorta and tracheobronchial tree. Aortobronchial fistula is a rare condition that is invariably fatal if not diagnosed and surgically treated. With appropriate surgical intervention, survival rates greater than 70% can be achieved. A review of the literature and an illustrative case report are presented. A total of 63 fistulas in 62 patients have been described. The case we present is unusual in the use of serratus anterior muscle for repair of the fistula. Eighty-seven percent of the cases documented in the literature were associated with an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta. Eighty-six percent of the fistulas were between the descending aorta and left bronchopulmonary tree. More than 95% of patients experienced at least a single episode of hemoptysis, and massive hemoptysis occurred in more than half of the reported cases. A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only 54% of cases. Plain chest radiographs definitively demonstrated an aneurysm in only 16%. The computed tomographic scan was the most rewarding test, identifying an aneurysm in 11 of 12 patients and the fistula in 50% of them. Surgical repair resulted in a 76% survival rate. 
3	Antinociceptive interaction between opioids and medetomidine: systemic additivity and spinal synergy. The antinociceptive interaction on the tail flick (TF) and hot plate (HP) tests between opioid analgesics and medetomidine after intravenous (iv) or intrathecal administration were examined by isobolographic analysis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats received fixed ratios of medetomidine to morphine, fentanyl, and meperidine of 1:10 and 1:30, 10:1, and 1:3, respectively, by iv administration or 10:1, 3:1 and 10:1, and 1:3 by intrathecal administration, respectively. Data were expressed as the percentage maximal possible effect (%MPE). The A50 (dose producing 50% MPE) for each drug or drug combination was determined from the dose-response curve. Isobolographic analysis revealed that the effect of medetomidine combined with fentanyl, morphine, or meperidine was additive after iv administration. The intrathecal administration of combinations of medetomidine with the opioids produced a synergistic antinociceptive effect in the TF but not HP test. These data confirmed that the interaction between medetomidine and opioids in producing antinociception may be additive or synergistic, depending on the route of administration, drug ratio administered, and level of processing of the nociceptive input (i.e., spinal vs. supraspinal). Moreover, these results were consistent with a spinal role for alpha-2 adrenoceptors in mediating antinociception. The authors suggest that the interaction between the opioid and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors occurs within the spinal cord. 
3	Transcranial Doppler in reversible migrainous vasospasm causing cerebellar infarction: report of a case. A young woman with a history of classic migraine suffered a large cerebellar infarction. Comprehensive evaluation did not disclose any potential causes for the stroke and she had no other risk factors. Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was useful in identifying vasospasm of the vertebral arteries. Following treatment with propranolol, angiography and repeat TCD revealed resolution of the vasospastic disorder. TCD is a useful noninvasive tool in detecting vasospasm associated with ischemic lesions in certain patients with migraine. 
5	Radiotherapy. The mainstay in the treatment of early glottic carcinoma. Early squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis may be effectively treated with surgery or radiation therapy. Controversy exists as to whether radiation therapy effects survival at the expense of vocal function by ultimately requiring more total laryngectomies for salvage of local tumor recurrence. This study reviewed the medical records of 185 patients with T1 or T2, NO invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis treated with primary radiation therapy between 1969 and 1984. All patients were followed up for a minimum of 5 years after completion of therapy. One hundred sixty-one patients met the criteria for local control analysis. Radiation therapy controlled disease in 93% (105 of 113) of patients with T1 lesions and 73% (38 of 48) of those with T2 tumors. Ultimate control of disease for T1 and T2 lesions, including surgical salvage, was 111 (98%) of 113 and 44 (92%) of 48 patients, respectively. The rate of successful surgical salvage was 75% (T1) and 70% (T2). The T2 lesions with impaired vocal cord mobility or anterior commissure disease were identified as being at increased risk for recurrence after primary radiation therapy. Overall voice preservation was 90%. Our data demonstrate that radiation therapy effects disease-free survival rates that are comparable to those produced by surgery, without sacrificing voice. Although a small percentage of patients with selected early glottic lesions may be more effectively treated with primary conservation surgery, these data do not support a change in philosophy concerning primary treatment of early glottic cancer with radiation therapy. 
5	The early diagnosis and treatment of developmental patella infera syndrome. Developmental patella infera and associated arthrofibrosis after knee surgery require prompt recognition and treatment. The condition develops because of contracture of peripatellar tissues, fatpad tissues, and quadriceps weakness, and may rapidly progress to permanent patella infera and disabling patellofemoral arthrosis. Case studies for five patients with acute developmental patella infera are described. All patients required an early arthroscopic release of contracted tissues. To establish normal right to left patellar, vertical-height ratios, lateral roentgenograms were obtained in 202 normal knees (101 pairs). The data showed that although essentially no difference existed between right and left sides, large variations existed in the ratios from one individual to another (range, 0.75-1.46). Thus, the diagnosis of developmental patella infera requires comparison of patellar height ratios in the same knee or between knees in the same individual. A decrease in the vertical-height ratio of 11%-15%, depending on the method used, indicates developmental patella infera. 
1	Computed tomographic density of metastatic lymph nodes as a treatment-related prognostic factor in advanced head and neck cancer. Pretherapeutic identification of patients likely to benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy for head and neck epidermoid cancer is of interest. We retrospectively analyzed the pretherapeutic computed tomographic (CT) scans of lymph nodes of 70 patients with head and neck cancer. All 70 patients were clinically classified as having stage IV disease. The purpose of our analysis was to compare the prognostic value of CT node density with that of the following factors: age, T and N categories, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, tumor site, histopathologic type of disease [squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) or undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UNCT)], and type of local-regional treatment. A simple two-grade nodal density grading system was devised. The density of normal adjacent muscle was chosen as the density standard. A node was classified grade 1 if less than 33% of the node consisted of hypodense zones. A node was classified grade 2 if more than 33% of the node consisted of hypodense zones. Patients with grade 1 nodes had a complete response rate of 68% (21/31) compared with 8% (3/39) for those with grade 2 nodes (P less than .0001). The only other factor associated with complete node response was UCNT (P less than .03). However, node density remained the significant prognostic factor after adjustment for histopathologic type. Follow-up ranged from 16 to 44 months, with a median of 29 months. Patients with grade 1 nodes had a median survival time of 32 months versus 13 months for those with grade 2 nodes (P less than .01). A prospective study should validate the prognostic value of CT node density and its possible use in determining optimal multimodal therapy for advanced head and neck cancers. 
1	Detection of bcr-abl fusion in chronic myelogeneous leukemia by in situ hybridization. Chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) is genetically characterized by fusion of the bcr and abl genes on chromosomes 22 and 9, respectively. In most cases, the fusion involves a reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11), which produces the cytogenetically distinctive Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1). Fusion can be detected by Southern (DNA) analysis or by in vitro amplification of the messenger RNA from the fusion gene with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques are sensitive but cannot be applied to single cells. Two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used with probes from portions of the bcr and abl genes to detect the bcr-abl fusion in individual blood and bone marrow cells from six patients. The fusion event was detected in all samples analyzed, of which three were cytogenetically Ph1-negative. One of the Ph1-negative samples was also PCR-negative. This approach is fast and sensitive, and provides potential for determining the frequency of the abnormality in different cell lineages. 
3	Differences in the membrane interaction of scrapie amyloid precursor proteins in normal and scrapie- or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease-infected brains. The membrane interaction and hydrophobicity of the normal (PrPC) and infectious isoform (PrPSc/CJD) of scrapie and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease amyloid precursor proteins was studied. The normal isoform of hamster and human scrapie amyloid precursor protein was found on the microsomal/synaptosomal membranes anchored solely by the C-terminal glycolipid. Glycolipid cleavage resulted in dissociation from the membranes and change of behavior from a highly hydrophobic to a hydrophilic protein, susceptible to proteases. In contrast, the PrPSc/CJD isoform was resistant to release by glycolipid-cleaving enzymes. A part of PrPSc/CJD was released from the membranes after prolonged trypsin treatment, yielding a further protease-resistant product of 27-30 kDa. The results demonstrate the proteolytic resistance of the membrane-bound PrPSc/CJD isoform and also indicate the presence of a different, apparently disease-induced mechanism of membrane interaction in the scrapie- and CJD-infected microsomal and synaptosomal membranes. 
4	Hypertensive heart disease: relationship of silent ischemia to coronary artery disease and left ventricular hypertrophy. ECG evidence of silent ischemia occurs commonly in patients with systemic hypertension, but its relationship to left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), large-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), and neurohumoral factors remains unclear. Accordingly we validated the results of the echocardiographic method used to measure left ventricular (LV) mass in the Soviet Union by comparison with necropsy measurements in 30 patients, and we examined the relationships in 46 men with essential hypertension among ST segment depression during ambulatory monitoring, exercise stress and transesophageal pacing (n = 38), and LV mass, catheterization evidence of CAD (n = 25), and neurohumoral factors (plasma catecholamines and platelet aggregability). Echocardiographic measurements of LV mass by both the Soviet and Penn methods were closely correlated with necropsy values (r = 0.78 and 90, respectively; both p less than 0.001). During ambulatory monitoring from 1 to 17 episodes of greater than or equal to 1 mm ST depression occurred in 26 of 46 (65%) patients with hypertension; ischemia was also provoked by exercise or pacing stress in most but not all of these patients (65% and 80%, respectively). Neither ST depression nor the occurrence of additional episodes of symptomatic angina was related to the presence of coronary obstruction at catheterization; patients with and without ST depression did not differ in age, blood pressure, or LV mass. 
2	Are cystgastrostomy and cystjejunostomy equivalent operations for pancreatic pseudocysts? To compare the effectiveness of cystgastrostomy and cystjejunostomy for treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts, 39 patients with cystgastrostomy were compared to 59 patients with cystjejunostomy. The groups were comparable in age, sex, cause of pancreatitis, pseudocyst location, symptoms, and preoperative serum amylase level. Cysts treated with cystgastrostomy were larger (mean diameter, 11.1 +/- 0.9 cm) than cysts treated by cystjejunostomy (mean diameter, 6.7 +/- 0.7 cm) (p less than 0.05). Mean duration of surgery was 148 +/- 11 minutes for cystgastrostomy versus 265 +/- 15 minutes for cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05). Mean blood loss was 397 +/- 82 ml for cystgastrostomy versus 703 +/- 80 ml for cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05) Mean intraoperative fluid requirements were 2640 +/- 313 ml for cystgastrostomy and 4403 +/- 362 ml for cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05). Cyst recurrence was 10% for cystgastrostomy versus 7% for cystgastrostomy. Postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in 8% of patients with cystgastrostomy and in 2% of patients with cystjejunostomy. Infection problems with cystjejunostomy included two wound infections and one case of septicemia; infection problems with cystjejunostomy included five intraabdominal abscesses, two wound infections, and one case of pneumonia. Two patients died with cystgastrostomy (both from gastrointestinal bleeding); two patients died with cystjejunostomy (one from intraabdominal sepsis and one from pulmonary embolus). Cystgastrostomy was used for significantly larger pseudocysts and was associated with significantly less blood loss and operating time than cystjejunostomy (p less than 0.05). Morbidity and mortality from cystgastrostomy and cystjejunostomy were comparable, although gastrointestinal bleeding was more common with cystgastrostomy and intraabdominal abscess was more common with cystjejunostomy. Since cystgastrostomy can usually be performed more quickly and with less blood loss, it should be considered whenever anatomically feasible. 
2	Twelve hour overnight oesophageal pH monitoring in patients with reflux symptoms. Results of continuous 12 hour overnight pH monitoring (duration of pH less than 4) were reviewed in 112 patients with heartburn or regurgitation, or both, and in 56 normal subjects. Patients had more reflux than normal subjects. Medically controlled patients (n = 51) had less acid reflux than patients who subsequently underwent reflux surgery (n = 61), but there was a considerable overlap between those two groups. Surgery was followed by a reduction in acid reflux to a value similar to that in normal subjects. Patients in whom surgery was deemed to have failed had more reflux after the operation than those in whom it was successful, but no difference could be found in the preoperative reflux values of these two subgroups. Monitoring pH is not of value in selecting candidates for surgery since the results are not a good predictor of outcome, but it is useful in the objective evaluation of surgical results. 
1	Pediatric spinal epidural metastases. A total of 2259 children with solid malignant tumors were treated at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital between the years 1962 and 1987. Of these, 112 (5%) developed spinal epidural metastasis with spinal cord compression during the course of their disease process. Metastatic epidural spinal cord compression was caused most commonly by Ewing's sarcoma and neuroblastoma, followed by osteogenic sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, Hodgkin's disease, soft-tissue sarcoma, germ-cell tumor, Wilm's tumor, and (rarely) hepatoma. There was no significant difference in outcome between patients with small-cell tumors (neuroblastoma, Hodgkin's disease, and germ-cell tumors) who received only chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy and the patients with similar lesions who received a decompressive laminectomy alone or prior to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Patients with spinal cord compression from metastatic sarcoma (Ewing's sarcoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma) showed a significant improvement with decompressive laminectomy alone or before medical therapy, compared to those who received radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy without posterior decompression. Pediatric tumors invade the spinal canal via the neural foramen, compressing the spinal cord in a circumferential manner, allowing decompressive laminectomy (posterior approach) to be an effective surgical approach. Sixty-six percent of children who had no evidence of motor or sensory function below the level of the compression became ambulatory after surgical decompression and medical treatment, regardless of tumor type. 
3	Pregnancy in a patient with treated Wilson's disease: a case report. Pregnancy should have a successful outcome in a patient with treated Wilson's disease if complications are excluded before conception. Chelating treatment must be maintained, although there is some concern about its teratogenicity. We describe the course of pregnancy in a patient followed up in our department. 
5	Massive histamine release in a patient with systemic mastocytosis. We have measured plasma histamine concentrations, systemic vascular resistance, cardiac output and arterial pressure during laparotomy in a patient with systemic mastocytosis. The patient developed vasodilation and hypotension during surgery, associated with a massive increase in plasma histamine concentration. 
5	Effect of bleomycin on hematoporphyrin derivative phototherapy of solid tumors. Hematoporphyrin derivative phototherapy (HpD-PT) has been successfully used to localize and treat superficial squamous cell cancers. Bleomycin sulfate is a glycopeptide antibiotic that has antineoplastic properties against squamous cell cancers. Because both HpD-PT and bleomycin chemotherapy are accepted forms of treatment for squamous cell cancer and their cytotoxicity is mediated by singlet oxygen and oxygen radicals, we studied the possibility of enhancing the response of solid tumors to HpD-PT by combining this modality with systemic bleomycin chemotherapy in a murine tumor model. Bleomycin did not enhance HpD-PT significantly. Also, we are not confident that HpD-PT alone or in combination with other agents can eradicate solid tumors; it certainly did not in this syngeneic murine tumor model. 
5	Angiodysplasia: characterization, diagnosis, and advances in treatment. Gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for 2% of all adult hospital admissions each year. Angiodysplasia is one of the most frequently reported causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. In 80% of patients with bleeding angiodysplasia, the bleeding will stop spontaneously, but will often recur. Although angiography may detect bleeding in 86% of actively bleeding patients, the bleeding rate must be at least 0.5 mL/min. The treatment of choice for control of bleeding has been resection of the suspected segment of bowel, but this procedure is associated with a 10% rebleeding rate and 7% to 8% mortality. Superselective catheterization with infusion of vasoconstrictors has been used to control bleeding, but effects are short-lived. Superselective embolization occludes an offending vessel, but is difficult to perform accurately and is associated with risk of infarction. Laser photocoagulation controls bleeding in 84% of patients, with a 6% complication rate. This method of controlling bleeding offers distinct advantages, especially for the hemodynamically unstable patient. Except for cases in which surgical resection is indicated, Nd:YAG laser photocoagulation is the safest, least invasive, and probably most effective means of treating angiodysplasia. 
3	Confusion. The term confusion describes a plethora of possible cognitive deficits and behavioral manifestations. A subjective assessment of confusion must be followed by an objective systematic evaluation to develop the cognitive-behavior profile. Because of age-associated physiologic and pathologic changes, elderly patients are at high risk for developing acute confusion. The management of confusion presents a challenge to nursing. Nursing can play a significant role in the prevention and the early detection of acute confusion. Preventing or identifying confusion early will decrease the physical and psychological stress of the patient as well as decrease the cost of hospitalization by shortening length of stay. Additional research is needed to determine the efficacy of present nursing activities and to identify new approaches for management. 
5	Nitrous oxide and epinephrine-induced arrhythmias. We asked whether the sympathomimetic effect of nitrous oxide (N2O) predisposed patients receiving N2O to arrhythmias in response to epinephrine administration. We also asked whether aging contributed to the development of arrhythmias, with or without N2O. One hundred patients having transsphenoidal hypophysectomy were randomly assigned to receive anesthesia including (n = 49) or excluding (n = 51) N2O. All patients were given an injection of epinephrine 1:200,000, with 0.5% lidocaine to produce hemostasis. Using intermittent 12-lead and continuous lead II electrocardiography, we determined the incidence of premature ventricular contraction, isorhythmic atrioventricular (AV) dissociation, and changes in T-wave morphology. Patients given N2O had a significantly higher incidence of isorhythmic AV dissociation (61.2% vs 41.2%). A trend toward a higher incidence of multiple premature ventricular contractions (16.3% vs 7.8%) was not statistically significant. Both anesthetic groups had a high incidence of postoperative changes in T-wave morphology (46.9% in the N2O group vs 50.9% in the group not given N2O). Aging alone did not affect the incidence of ventricular ectopic beats, isorhythmic AV dissociation, or changes in electrocardiographic morphology, but correlated with the development of ventricular ectopy during N2O anesthesia. We conclude that the use of N2O correlated with a higher incidence of isorhythmic AV dissociation in response to injection of epinephrine with lidocaine. 
4	Coronary artery bypass operation in dialysis patients. To analyze the short- and long-term morbidity and mortality among maintenance dialysis patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass operations, we identified 25 such patients at the Mayo Clinic and three recently published large single-center studies that provided sufficient detail for meaningful comparison. Two independent observers reviewed the new information with regard to pertinent historical, clinical, and laboratory data. The perioperative mortality was 20%. Among the perioperative survivors, 1- and 2-year survival rates were 95% and 77%, respectively. The 3-year actuarial survival was 70%. Uniformly, the symptoms diminished, and the need for antianginal medication was decreased. In the three other large published series, the perioperative mortality ranged from 3 to 20%, and coronary artery bypass performed earlier after the onset of the symptoms seemed to result in a lower perioperative mortality. We conclude that elective coronary artery bypass in dialysis patients is associated with acceptable short-term morbidity and mortality and effective relief of symptoms. Surgically treated patients may have a survival advantage. Thus, we advocate aggressive early investigation and surgical treatment of these patients. 
5	The effect of adjunctive arteriovenous fistula on prosthetic graft patency: a controlled study in a canine model. Bilateral 6 mm PTFE grafts were placed from the external iliac artery to the femoral artery with ligation of the intervening segment of the iliofemoral artery in 14 dogs. An arteriovenous fistula was constructed at the distal anastomosis on one randomly selected side in each animal while the contralateral graft served as a control. Graft follow-up ranged between 8 and 12 months in all animals. Serial arteriography was performed to confirm graft and fistula patency and demonstrated persistence of antegrade flow into the arterial tree distal to all patent bypasses. Femoral intraarterial pressures distal to patent grafts were identical on both sides in each animal throughout the study. Cumulative life-table patency rates showed higher patency for the arteriovenous fistula bypasses than the control grafts at all time intervals: 71% vs. 57% at 3 months, 48% vs. 25% at 6 months, and 40% vs. 22% at 12 months, respectively. This is the first controlled study that provides experimental evidence suggesting that these bypasses may produce increased patency of prosthetic arterial grafts and lends support to their use in a clinical, prospective, randomized study. 
3	Tables for estimation of individual risks of fetal neural tube and ventral wall defects, incorporating prior probability, maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, and ultrasonographic examination results. Tables are provided for estimation of the risk of open spina bifida in patients who have elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels but normal results on detailed anatomy ultrasonographic scan. Risks are provided for various prior population risks, for various levels of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein, and for various assumptions about the sensitivity of ultrasonographic examination. The formula used is based on sequential multiplication of odds with the use of Bayes' theorem, but an arbitrary reduction (to the power of 0.5) in the degree to which ultrasonographic information modifies the odds has been made to allow for the nonindependence of ultrasonography and maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein tests. The wide range of resulting risks shows that the decision to offer amniocentesis after a negative scan should be individualized. 
4	Coronary perfusion catheter: its effectiveness in an experimental model of acute coronary occlusion. The effectiveness of a coronary perfusion catheter was studied in an animal model of acute coronary occlusion. Systemic hemodynamic variables, regional myocardial blood flow (RMBF) in the subepicardium and subendocardium, and regional systolic function (systolic segmental shortening) of the area perfused by the circumflex coronary artery (CX) were measured in eight anesthetized dogs. After baseline measurements, the CX coronary artery was occluded with a silk snare and measurements were repeated after 5 minutes of ischemia (occlusion No. 1). The snare was released and 1 hour later the snare occlusion was repeated after placement of a perfusion catheter in the CX coronary artery. After 5 minutes, measurements were repeated (occlusion No. 2). To determine the long-term effectiveness of the catheter, hemodynamic variables and regional function measurements were then obtained every 15 minutes for a total of 60 minutes. During occlusion No. 1, RMBF decreased from 1.30 +/- 0.20 to 0.41 +/- 0.13 ml.min-1.gm-1 (p less than 0.01), and subendocardial RMBF decreased from 1.44 +/- .24 to 0.34 +/- 0.15 ml.min-1.gm-1 (p less than 0.01). After insertion of the perfusion catheter (occlusion No. 2), subepicardial RMBF was maintained at 0.97 +/- 0.16 and subendocardial RMBF was maintained at 0.78 +/- 0.13 ml.min-1.gm-1; during occlusion No. 2 subepicardial RMBF was greater (p less than 0.05) than occlusion No. 1 and was not different from baseline. 
5	Bilateral emphysematous pyelonephritis. Emphysematous pyelonephritis is an uncommon and serious infection associated with gas-forming coliform bacteria. Bilateral involvement is rare with only 10 reported cases in the English literature. Prompt and aggressive management is required to salvage these patients. Preservation of renal function using broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical drainage provide the greatest benefit to these patients. Three new cases are presented with a brief review of the results of management in the reported cases. 
5	Effect of exposure of miners to aluminium powder. 'McIntyre Powder' (finely ground aluminium and aluminium oxide) was used as a prophylactic agent against silicotic lung disease between 1944 and 1979 in mines in northern Ontario. To find out whether the practice produced neurotoxic effects a morbidity prevalence study was conducted between 1988 and 1989. There were no significant differences between exposed and non-exposed miners in reported diagnoses of neurological disorder; however, exposed miners performed less well than did unexposed workers on cognitive state examinations; also, the proportion of men with scores in the impaired range was greater in the exposed than non-exposed group. Likelihood of scores in the impaired range increased with duration of exposure. The findings are consistent with putative neurotoxicity of chronic aluminium exposure. 
5	Omeprazole in H2 receptor antagonist-resistant reflux esophagitis. We conducted a retrospective review of 25 patients with severe reflux esophagitis treated with omeprazole because of failure of H2 receptor antagonists to heal their esophagitis. Prior to beginning omeprazole (40 mg/day), all patients were on H2 antagonists for at least 9 months and still had endoscopic evidence of longitudinal (grade II) or circumferential (grade III) distal esophageal ulceration. Omeprazole therapy brought about complete endoscopic healing in 24 of 25 patients (96%). Twenty-three of 24 healed patients were then restarted on H2 antagonists as maintenance therapy. Repeat endoscopy was performed if symptoms recurred. Fourteen of 24 patients (58%) had recurrence of endoscopic esophagitis documented between 26 and 300 days from the time of starting maintenance therapy. Two of these 14 patients opted for antireflux surgery, whereas the remaining 12 were once again given omeprazole, which again resulted in symptom resolution in all patients. These data suggest that most patients with H2 receptor antagonist-resistant ulcerative esophagitis cannot be successfully maintained on H2 antagonists even after the ulcers have been healed with omeprazole. Further studies are required to determine the role of omeprazole compared to other treatments in the long-term maintenance therapy of these patients. 
1	Primary leiomyoma of the liver. A 30-yr-old woman with right upper quadrant abdominal pain was found to have a hepatic leiomyoma. This is the youngest patient in whom this rare tumor has been found. The diagnostic approach toward gastrointestinal leiomyomata is emphasized, including the role of immunohistochemistry. 
1	Primary lymphoma of the liver: clinical and pathological features of 10 patients. Nine out of 10 patients with primary lymphoma of the liver presented in a manner that did not suggest a tumour. The initial diagnoses were chronic active hepatitis in three cases and "granulomatous cholangitis", inflammatory pseudotumour, and anaplastic carcinoma in one case each. Moreover, extensive haemorrhagic necrosis in three cases initially suggested the Budd-Chiari syndrome. All the tumours were diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphomas like the 50 cases reported previously, but they differed from most of these in that nine were of T cell phenotype. Five were pleomorphic small T cell, two T zone, and two T lymphoblastic lymphomas: only one was centrocytic and of B cell lineage. This report extends the range of clinical manifestations (diffuse hepatomegaly without a tumour), histological appearances (resemblance to chronic inflammatory or vascular liver diseases) and phenotype (of T cell lineage) of primary lymphoma of the liver: these features seemed to be related in this series. Recognition is important as prognosis remains favourable in appropriately treated cases. Although the appearances of the liver biopsy specimens may be difficult to interpret, the destructiveness of the infiltrate is an important clue to the diagnosis. 
5	Hemifacial spasm in Rochester and Olmsted County, Minnesota, 1960 to 1984. The incidence of hemifacial spasm in residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, was studied by reviewing the medical records of patients residing in the community between 1960 and 1984. The average annual incidence rate was 0.74 per 100,000 in men and 0.81 per 100,000 in women, age-adjusted to the 1970 US white population. The average prevalence rate was 7.4 per 100,000 population in men and 14.5 per 100,000 in women. The incidence and prevalence rates were highest in those from 40 to 79 years of age. 
3	Meningitis due to protozoa and helminths. This article reviews the microbiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic tests, and recent advances in the therapy of protozoan and helminthic infections of the central nervous system, with more emphasis given to protozoan than to helminthic infections. 
1	Immunodetection of the metastasis-associated laminin receptor in human breast cancer cells obtained by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the breast is a very useful technique for the evaluation of a suspect lesion before surgical removal. Increased expression of the 67-kd laminin receptor has been associated with the metastatic phenotype of cancer cells, particularly in colon and breast cancers. In this study, the expression of laminin receptor was evaluated using the immunoperoxidase technique in 81 breast aspirates (26 benign and 55 neoplastic lesions). Cells obtained from benign samples exhibited a low level of laminin receptor antigen detected by affinity-purified antibody raised against a cDNA-derived laminin receptor peptide. In contrast, 71% of smears obtained from malignant breast lesions contained cells that were strongly stained by the antibody. Heterogeneous expression of the laminin receptor was noted in both breast aspirates and fixed tissue specimens. These data suggest that the immunodetection of laminin receptor in cells obtained by fine-needle aspiration of breast lesions could be a valuable adjunct in the prognostic evaluation of breast lesions. 
5	The systemic septic response: concepts of pathogenesis. Following resuscitation from shock, the clinical phase of persistent hypermetabolism is entered from which a substantial number of patients transcend into progressive organ failure and expire. The available epidemiologic, physiologic, and metabolic data are consistent with the position that a persistent degree of microcirculatory hypoxia, although it may be present in amounts that are below the sensitivity of current detection systems, becomes an increasingly less important etiologic factor as the organ failure disease progresses. Rather, aerobic metabolism appears to be the dominant mechanism of meeting the increased work loads and energy demands. There is an increasing body of evidence that cytokine release systemically, and increased cell-cell interaction through cytokines and prostanoids locally, may alter not only parenchymal function in the proximity of these mononuclear cells, but organ function at distant sites. If this latter hypothesis continues to be substantiated, it implies that the underlying cell and organ dysfunction may indeed be reversible if appropriate counter-regulatory mechanisms could be developed and the appropriate timing of their application understood. 
4	Renal artery stenosis: evaluation with color Doppler flow imaging. Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is the most common correctable cause of hypertension. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the usefulness of color Doppler flow imaging as a screening examination in the detection of significant RAS. Fifty-five kidneys in 30 patients were examined with aortography and color Doppler flow imaging in a double-blind fashion. The peak systolic velocity (PSV) in the renal artery, the renal-aortic ratio (RAR) (ie, the ratio of the PSV in the renal artery to the PSV in the aorta), and the renal artery resistive index were determined and compared with the percentage of stenosis as determined with angiography. Ultrasound (US) criteria used to diagnose RAS were (a) an RAR of 3.5 or greater and/or (b) a renal artery PSV of greater than 100 cm/sec. Doppler tracings were obtained in 25 (69%) of 36 kidneys with a patent single renal artery. RAR and PSV each yielded a sensitivity of 0% in the diagnosis of RAS. Doppler tracings were obtained in three (50%) of six occluded renal arteries. Accessory arteries were present in 13 (24%) of 55 kidneys, but none were visualized with color Doppler flow imaging. The authors conclude that with current technical capability, color duplex US is not an adequate screening method for the detection of RAS. 
2	Metastatic carcinoma of the gallbladder from renal cancer presenting as intraluminal polypoid mass. We report a rare case of secondary involvement of the gallbladder by metastatic renal cell carcinoma. A 71-year-old man was diagnosed as having a polypoid mass within the gallbladder when he underwent right nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma. A preoperative diagnosis of simultaneous carcinoma of the gallbladder was made, and extended cholecystectomy with regional lymphadenectomy was performed five months after the initial operation. Postoperative histological examination of the polypoid mass within the gallbladder and a pancreatic mass excised during the second surgery revealed these resected tumors to be identical to the clear cell type of renal cell carcinoma. We feel that this case presents synchronous involvement of the gallbladder and pancreas by metastatic renal cell carcinoma of the right kidney. 
5	Clinical characteristics and coronary angiographic findings of patients with unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, and survivors of sudden ischemic death occurring during and after sport. The clinical characteristics and coronary angiographic findings of 42 well-conditioned subjects with an acute ischemic event related to sport are reported. Five patients had unstable angina, 25 had acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and 12 were resuscitated victims of sudden ischemic death. Twenty-two events occurred during sport (group A) and 20 after sport (group B). There were two women and 40 men. The mean age was 46 years (range 25 to 65). Twelve out of 30 patients who smoked cigarettes had an adjunctive risk factor for coronary artery disease. Twelve others (28%) had no identifiable risk factor. Prodromal cardiac symptoms were detected in three patients (group A). Two patients had previous myocardial infarction (group B). Coronary angiography was performed acutely in 39 patients. The distribution of the ischemia-related coronary artery was comparable in both groups. The lesion morphology of 35 culprit coronary arteries was described as concentric in six patients and eccentric with regular borders (type I lesion) in 11 and irregular borders (type II lesion) in 18. Eccentric lesions consistent with ruptured plaques prevailed in both groups. Associated coronary artery disease was present in 10 patients. There was no relationship between the number of risk factors and the extent of diseased coronary arteries. Clinical characteristics and coronary angiographic findings of patients with unstable angina, AMI, and sudden death either during or after sport are similar and indicate a common pathogenesis. The probable mechanism of a coronary event related to sport is exercise-induced plaque rupture. In most instances such an event is unexpected and unpredictable. Identification of some subjects at risk is possible. 
4	Oral contraception in disease states. Oral contraceptives are clearly contraindicated in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease, ischemic heart attack, or cerebral stroke. Patients requiring long-term anticoagulant treatment can be treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to prevent ovulation, because ruptured follicles can cause massive intraperitoneal bleeding. Patients with essential hypertension and severe liver diseases should also discontinue treatment 4 weeks before major elective surgery. Migraine and diabetes mellitus are regarded as relative contraindications, depending on the individual situation. Long-term diseases, such as Crohn's disease, epilepsy, and sickle cell anemia, also require individualized consultation. 
1	Lymphoma of the gastric stump: report of a case. We report a case of primary lymphoma on a previously resected stomach in a 62-year-old man. The patient was treated 22 years earlier with a partial gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction for a benign gastric ulcer. The rarity of this entity and its possible relationship with pseudolymphoma or lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is discussed, and the literature is reviewed. 
5	Expression of P-glycoprotein in adult T-cell leukemia cells. We have examined the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) samples from 25 patients. Based on immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody against P-gp, C219, 8 of 20 ATL patients were P-gp positive at the initial presentation. All 6 patients at the relapsed stage were P-gp positive, and refractory to chemotherapy. The expression of MDR1 mRNA in P-gp-positive ATL cells was increased at the relapsed stage of one patient. P-gp of this patient was photolabeled with [3H]azidopine and the labeling was inhibited with nimodipine, vinblastine and progesterone. These results suggest that P-gp expressed in ATL cells from patients at relapsed stage has the same binding site(s) for the drugs as that in multidrug resistant cells, and is correlated with the refractory nature of the cells to chemotherapy. 
4	Clinical evaluation of delapril in Japan. Report from the Japan Study Group on Delapril. Delapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor discovered in the laboratory of Takeda Chemical Industries, Ltd., is the result of drug design based on the structure-activity relationships of ACE inhibitors. Delapril is an antihypertensive agent with a relatively long duration of action and no SH moiety in its structure. Following administration, it is converted into two active metabolites. Delapril effectively lowered blood pressure in 73% of 1,008 patients with hypertension during clinical trials in Japan. Efficacy rates were 73% for essential hypertension, 85% for renal hypertension, and 80% for renovascular hypertension. Excellent hypotensive response was observed in all age groups, from young to elderly patients. Side effects during administration of delapril, based on subjective evidence, were reported in 80 out of the 1,008 cases (7.9%). The main symptoms included orthostatic dizziness (1.7%), dizziness (1.3%), and nausea (1.1%). Dry cough, which has attracted attention in recent years as a side effect of ACE inhibitors, was reported at a low incidence of 1.1%. In a double-blind, controlled study in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension in which captopril served as a positive control, delapril showed superior hypotensive effect and greater safety. Data derived from the Japan Study Group on Delapril indicate that this ACE inhibitor has excellent hypotensive effects and a high level of safety. It is suitable as a first-line drug in both monotherapy and combined therapy. 
5	The effects of an iron chelator on cellular injury induced by vascular stasis caused by hypothermia. Rewarming of a cooled rabbit leg was associated with the generation of oxygen-derived free radicals, shown to be instrumental for tissue injury occurring during rewarming. The present study used a compound that, by its ability to bind with free iron, can remove hydroxyl radical (OH.) from tissue. Deferoxamine reduced tissue injury during cooling and rewarming, as evidenced by its ability to decrease tissue release of lactic acid dehydrogenase and creatine kinase. Deferoxamine also reduced the formation of OH. and lipid peroxidation during the rewarming phase. This compound did not have any effect on the arterial blood flow pattern, which uniformly decreased during cooling and was restored during rewarming. The results of this study indicate the efficacy of deferoxamine in reducing cellular injury associated with cold and rewarming and further suggest a role for oxygen-derived free radicals in the pathophysiology of cold-rewarming injury. 
2	Delayed subcapsular hematoma after percutaneous liver biopsy as a manifestation of warfarin toxicity. Guidelines for the management of patients receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy who require liver biopsy are not clearly defined. In patients with normal coagulation, liver biopsy is a relatively safe procedure with a morbidity of less than 0.1% and a mortality of less than 0.01%. We report a patient with a prosthetic aortic valve who developed a large subcapsular hematoma 12 days after a percutaneous liver biopsy as a consequence of warfarin toxicity. Based on the experience with this patient, reinstitution of anticoagulant therapy should be avoided for at least 72 h after a percutaneous liver biopsy. Intravenous heparin should be resumed first, and warfarin added if no bleeding has occurred after an additional 48-72 h. The prothrombin time should be maintained at 1.5 times the baseline. 
5	t(3;21)(q26;q22): a recurring chromosomal abnormality in therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia. We have identified an identical reciprocal translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 3 and 21 with breakpoints at bands 3q26 and 21q22, [t(3;21)(q26;q22)], in the malignant cells from five adult patients with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML). Primary diagnoses were Hodgkin's disease in two patients and ovarian carcinoma, breast cancer, and polycythemia vera in one patient each. Patients had been treated with chemotherapy including an alkylating agent for their primary disease 1 to 18 years before the development of t-MDS or t-AML. We have not observed the t(3;21) in over 1,500 patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia arising de novo or in over 1,000 patients with lymphoid malignancies. We have previously reported that the t(3;21) occurs in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Thus, the t(3;21) appears to be limited to t-MDS/t-AML and CML, both of which represent malignant disorders of an early hematopoietic precursor cell. These results provide a new focus for the study of therapy-related leukemia at the molecular level. 
4	Design mediated thrombus reduction in the Utah-100 total artificial heart. The Utah-100 total artificial heart was initially designed and tested in 1983. General design goals, including improved fit for human application, improved reliability, and elimination of thrombus formation, were identified as improvements over the clinically used Jarvik-7 artificial heart, previously developed at the Institute for Biomedical Engineering, University of Utah. Specific design goals included 1) elimination of connector and valve-associated thrombus formation and 2) elimination of gross mineralization, thrombus formation, and creases on the blood-pumping diaphragm of the device. Explant retrieval results from 29 calves and sheep implanted with the Jarvik-7 artificial heart were compared with results from 25 calves and sheep implanted with the Utah-100 artificial heart. Macroscopic thrombus formation was found in 44% of the connectors of the Jarvik-7 artificial-hearts, compared with 2% (p less than or equal to 0.01) in animals with the Utah-100 artificial heart. Subvalvular and supravalvular thrombi were observed in 33% of the valves in the Jarvik-7 artificial heart and 10% (p less than or equal to 0.01) of the valves in the Utah-100 artificial heart. Mineralization of the pumping diaphragm was observed in 12% of the animals implanted with the Jarvik-7 artificial heart and in 4% of the animals with the Utah-100 diaphragms. Thrombus formation in the diaphragm-housing interface occurred in 2% of Jarvik-7 ventricles and in 6% of the Utah-100 ventricles. There were no identifiable diaphragm creases in the Utah-100 diaphragms, but a 10% incidence was found in Jarvik-7 devices. These results validate substantial progress toward improved design and fabrication methods in the Utah-100 total artificial heart. 
4	Reduction of myocardial reperfusion injury by intravenous adenosine administered during the early reperfusion period. Adenosine influences the function of several cell types thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial reperfusion injury. We have previously demonstrated that intracoronary administration of adenosine enhances myocardial salvage 24 hours after reperfusion. To determine if these beneficial effects could be obtained during a prolonged period of reperfusion using an intravenous route of administration, 22 closed-chest dogs were subjected to 90 minutes of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion and 72 hours of reperfusion. Animals randomly received either intravenous adenosine (0.15 mg/kg/min) or an equal volume of Ringer's lactate during the first 150 minutes of reperfusion. The area at risk was defined in vivo with Monastral blue, and infarct size was measured histologically with Mallory's trichrome stain. Serial global and regional ventricular function were determined with contrast ventriculography and analyzed using a computerized radial shortening method. Biopsies were obtained from the central ischemic zone to assess endothelial ultrastructure and capillary obstruction. No significant effects in heart rate or blood pressure were noted during adenosine infusion. Transmural collateral blood flow during ischemia was similar in the groups. Infarct size expressed as a percentage of the anatomical area at risk was significantly less in the adenosine-treated group (35.3 +/- 4.3% in controls versus 17.1 +/- 4.3% in treated animals, p less than 0.01). A progressive decrease in transmural blood flow was noted in control animals during reperfusion, resulting in a significant reduction at 3 hours compared with the preocclusion value (0.69 +/- 0.11 ml/min/g [at baseline versus 0.45 +/- 0.10 ml/min/g at 3 hours, p less than 0.05]). In contrast, flow in adenosine animals at 3 hours was similar to baseline values (0.91 +/- 0.15 ml/min/g at baseline versus 0.98 +/- 0.14 ml/min/g at 3 hours, p = NS) and was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than the control group. Radial shortening in the ischemic zone was significantly improved at 3 (-2.6 +/- 2.8% in controls versus 11.6 +/- 3.3% in treated animals, p less than 0.01) and 72 hours (5.5 +/- 2.0% in controls versus 17.3 +/- 3.5% in treated animals, p less than 0.01) after reperfusion in treated animals. Electron microscopy showed reduced neutrophil and erythrocyte plugging of capillaries with relative preservation of endothelial cell structure in the adenosine group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
2	Assessment of the risk of bleeding from esophageal varices by continuous monitoring of portal pressure. Portal pressure was monitored by means of an indwelling hepatic vein balloon catheter in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and bleeding varices to determine the safety and feasibility of the technique and its value in predicting recurrence of bleeding. Forty patients were enrolled. Central venous access could not be achieved in 4 patients (10%). Hepatic vein catheterization was accomplished in the remaining 36 patients. Fourteen patients were either later found to have nonalcoholic liver disease or had already received treatment that excluded them from the protocol. The remaining 22 patients, who were treated with blood and fluid replacement, were monitored for up to 72 hours. Portal pressure was greater than 11 mm Hg in all patients (normal, less than 5 mm Hg) and did not change significantly over the 3 days of study. Portal pressure was significantly higher in the 9 patients who continued to bleed or rebled compared with the 13 patients who remained stable. The lowest pressure associated with continued bleeding or rebleeding was 16 mm Hg. Continuous monitoring of portal pressure in patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to alcoholic cirrhosis is safe and feasible and permits rapid stratification of the risk of continued bleeding or early rebleeding. 
5	Congenital dermoid fistula of the lower lip. A case of congenital dermoid fistula of the lower lip is presented. The lesion consisted of a major cystic portion, a proximal tubelike extension that opened in the lower lip as a small sinus (pit) near the left commissure, and a distal cordlike extension that entered into the left mental foramen. The cystic cavity was lined with keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, and many sebaceous glands, sweat glands, and hair follicles were seen subcutaneously. The differential diagnosis and the pathogenesis of the lesion are also discussed. 
4	Through-knee amputation in high-risk patients with vascular disease: indications, complications and rehabilitation. During a 10-year period 104 patients (mean age 72 years) had 106 through-knee amputations. Indications for surgery were: limb gangrene, 67 (64 per cent); ischaemic ulceration, 22 (21 per cent); rest pain, 9; knee contractures, 6. Thirty patients had had previous unsuccessful vascular reconstructive surgery and five had had a failed femoral embolectomy. The through-knee disarticulation used lateral skin flaps. The mortality was 21 (20 per cent). Of the 83 survivors, 59 (71 per cent) underwent uncomplicated primary wound healing; 36 (43 per cent) of the survivors were unsuitable for rehabilitation on a prosthesis. The remaining 47 (57 per cent) were walking before discharge 30-130 days (mean 68 days) after amputation. Through-knee amputation is a rapid, relatively bloodless, amputation and is a useful debridement procedure. The many surgical and functional advantages, in conjunction with the recent reports of better rehabilitation compared with the above-knee or Gritti-Stokes amputation, suggests that the through-knee amputation deserves greater consideration. 
4	Adverse treatment effects in the trial of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly. Adverse treatment effects were assessed in 840 elderly hypertensive patients randomly assigned to active treatment (a combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide) or placebo; methyldopa was added to the regimen in one third of the treated patients. Symptoms of dry mouth, nasal stuffiness, and diarrhea were reported by significantly more treated patients than placebo control subjects. More patients receiving diuretics plus methyldopa than diuretics alone reported dry mouth and diarrhea. Significantly more treated patients than control subjects showed evidence of a high serum creatinine level, mild hypokalemia, and gout. More treated patients tended to have diabetes. The benefits of treatment outweighed these adverse treatment effects. 
4	Technetium-99m sestamibi in chronic coronary artery disease: the European experience. Since the introduction of technetium-99m methoxy-isobutyl isonitrile (Tc-99m sestamibi) in Europe, there has been a growing interest in its use. Several European multicenter trials have been conducted to evaluate this new agent in relation to the traditional perfusion marker thallium-201, and other studies are in progress to understand the use of this perfusion marker for the diagnosis of coronary disease, for use in conjunction with pharmacologic vasodilation, for use in the assessment of ventricular function and wall motion and for the assessment of interventions. 
5	Small bowel enteroscopy: an early experience in gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin. Peroral small intestinal enteroscopy was performed in 35 consecutive patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin by using a prototypic Sonde-type enteroscope. The median value for patient age was 69 years; duration of bleeding, 2 years (range, 2 months to 9 years); and transfusion requirements, 9 units. Bleeding was occult in 54% of these patients. Placement and passage of the enteroscope was performed by a gastrointestinal endoscopy assistant. Mean passage time was 4.3 hours. Complete passage was obtained in 14% of the patients, passage into the mid-distal ileum in 69%, and passage only into the jejunum in 17%. The diagnostic yield was 26%, with the majority of lesions encountered being mucosal vascular malformations. Small intestinal enteroscopy is a reasonable diagnostic procedure before embarking on visceral angiography and surgical exploration when standard endoscopic and radiologic methods fail to disclose a diagnosis. 
1	The axilla: not a no-go zone Many surgeons, particularly in the UK, give inadequate primary treatment to patients with operable breast cancer. For spurious reasons they regard axillary clearance as unnecessarily extensive surgery and rely instead upon total mastectomy or tumour excision and node sampling, with or without postoperative radiotherapy. But it is now clear that relapse-free and overall survival can be improved by appropriate adjuvant therapy. Thus inadequate exploration of the axilla is doubly unjustified. Not only is there the obvious risk of failure to remove nodes that contain metastases--so that some patients are deprived of cure by primary treatment--but the extent of tumour spread will be inadequately assessed in many more patients, with the risk that they may not receive appropriate adjuvant treatment. 
1	Immunohistochemical demonstration of keratin in ameloblastoma as an indication of tumor differentiation. Keratin expression was studied immunohistochemically in 27 ameloblastomas using polyclonal antibody against wide-spectrum keratins (TTL) and monoclonal antibodies against lower- and higher-molecular-weight keratins (PKK1 and KL1), respectively, to clarify the tumor differentiation. Reactions with TTL and KL1 antibodies were generally positive in the stellate cells of the follicular or acanthomatous ameloblastomas. Cell nests of the basal cell type were positive for PKK1. On the other hand, the reactions with TTL or KL1 in the plexiform type were generally weak or absent. From these facts, it was concluded that the follicular, as well as acanthomatous, ameloblastoma is liable to undergo squamous differentiation, whereas the plexiform ameloblastoma remains in primitive stage of tumor differentiation. 
1	Tumor suppressor genes: new prospects for cancer research. Cancer is thought to arise from the accumulation of several genetic mutations in a single cell. Until recently, the only tumorigenic mutations that have been studied in detail are those that activate oncogenes. The discovery of tumor suppressor genes, for which inactivating mutations elicit tumorigenesis, has added a new dimension to our understanding of neoplasia. The retinoblastoma susceptibility gene RB is the prototype tumor suppressor gene and has been shown to suppress the transformed phenotype for several different cancers. Additional studies have revealed other tumor suppressor genes that may operate in a variety of tissues through a variety of mechanisms. These mechanisms may regulate the choice between cellular proliferation and differentiation and appear to involve such processes as the initiation of DNA replication, regulation of expression of certain genes, intercellular communication and adhesion, and the transduction of external signals to intracellular effectors. The elucidation of these mechanisms will enhance our understanding of both oncogenesis and the fundamental operations of the cell. 
1	Therapy of renal cell carcinoma with interleukin-2 and lymphokine-activated killer cells: phase II experience with a hybrid bolus and continuous infusion interleukin-2 regimen. Forty-seven patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell carcinoma were treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK)-cell therapy, using a hybrid IL-2 regimen. IL-2 was administered initially by intravenous bolus (10(5) U/kg [Cetus Corp, Emeryville, CA] every 8 hours for 3 days) during the priming phase, and subsequently by continuous infusion (3 x 10(6) U/m2 for 6 days); during this second treatment period, in vitro-generated LAK cells were administered. Despite selection of patients for good performance status (PS) (29, PS 0; 18, PS 1) prior nephrectomy (43 of the 47 patients), and low tumor burden, the response rate was low (two complete [CRs] and two partial responses [PRs], for an overall objective response rate of 9%). Toxicity was comparable to that experienced with the high-dose bolus regimen. These results suggest that the dose and schedule of IL-2 administration may influence the likelihood of response to IL-2 in renal cell carcinoma. 
4	Coronary morphology after percutaneous directional coronary atherectomy in humans: autopsy analysis of three patients. The morphologic basis of angiographically successful percutaneous directional atherectomy and subsequent restenosis in human coronary arteries is unknown. The clinical and pathologic features of three patients who died after coronary atherectomy are described. Tissue fragments obtained with atherectomy demonstrated atheromatous and fibroproliferative intima, media and adventitia. At autopsy, treated vascular segments (from the left anterior descending artery in two patients and a vein graft in one patient) demonstrated discrete defects in the vascular wall. Defects extending into atheroma, media or adventitia corresponded with the presence of these tissues in the atherectomy specimens. Tissues were otherwise not disrupted in the manner associated with balloon angioplasty. Acute mural thrombus deposition was evident in the resection zone in one patient. Late findings included fibroproliferative intimal tissue extending from the resected areas into the vascular lumen. In one patient intimal hyperplasia was sufficient to narrow the vascular lumen by 82% and was implicated in subsequent myocardial ischemia and infarction. The study indicates that 1) the vascular injury associated with atherectomy is distinct from that associated with balloon angioplasty, 2) acute mural thrombus deposition may occur even with resection limited to the intima, and 3) intimal hyperplasia may develop in regions treated with atherectomy and may be associated with late myocardial ischemia and infarction. 
3	Tourette syndrome and other tic disorders. Diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment. In this report, we discuss the definition, characteristics, pathophysiology, and treatment of tic disorders with a major emphasis on Tourette syndrome. Although the diagnosis of a tic disorder depends on the presence of motor and/or phonic tic(s), patients with these problems also have a variety of co-morbid features including obsessive-compulsive symptoms, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, behavioral difficulties, and learning disabilities. Conservative estimates for Tourette syndrome suggest a prevalence rate of 0.1-1.0 per 1000. This syndrome is inherited in a sex-influenced autosomal dominant pattern with either chronic multiple tic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder as alternative phenotypes of the putative gene. Current evidence continues to support a pathophysiologic mechanism involving synaptic neurotransmission, with the dopaminergic system as a primary candidate. Therapeutically, it is essential to clarify whether a patient's problems are related to tics or associated behavioral difficulties. Pharmacotherapy for motor and phonic tics is strictly symptomatic and should be reserved for those with functionally disabling symptoms. A comprehensive individualized treatment program is often required in the care of individuals with tic disorders. 
1	Two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis due to hypercalcemia. We report two cases of adult T-cell leukemia associated with acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia. After sudden onset of epigastralgia, acute pancreatitis and hypercalcemia were found in both patients. There were no diseases that could explain the acute pancreatitis except for hypercalcemia probably due to adult T-cell leukemia. Thus we considered that hypercalcemia due to adult T-cell leukemia had led to acute pancreatitis. This is the first report of such a complication in adult T-cell leukemia. 
1	A phase II clinical trial of carboplatin infusion in high-risk acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia. Carboplatin (CBDCA) is a second-generation platinum drug that has been shown to be useful when used as a continuous infusion in treatment of refractory adult leukemia. We report on the effectiveness of continuous infusion CBDCA, 300 mg/m2/d x 5 days, as evaluated in nine patients with secondary acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) (seven previous myelodysplastic syndrome and two treatment-associated ANLL), three ANLL patients in first relapse, six refractory ANLL, and nine patients with blastic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia (BP-CML). All patients were considered assessable. The response rate was 44% (eight complete remissions [CRs], four partial remissions [PRs]). Median duration of postchemotherapy neutropenia was 36 days (range, 18 to 45). Therapy was well tolerated, and toxicity was mainly hematologic and nondose-limiting. Despite prolonged neutropenia, severe infections were rarely seen, and most patients were managed as outpatients. Twelve patients had nausea and vomiting, two had symptomatic hypomagnesemia, and one patient showed reversible ototoxicity. Because of substantial antileukemic activity and unusual extrahematologic toxicity, CBDCA appears to be an effective second-line agent in the treatment of ANLL and should be considered for upgrading to first-line treatment regimens. 
5	Oxygen debt and metabolic acidemia as quantitative predictors of mortality and the severity of the ischemic insult in hemorrhagic shock. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: An experimental canine model of hemorrhagic, hypovolemic shock is described that uses oxygen debt and its metabolic consequences of lactic acidemia and metabolic base deficit as independent variables for the prediction of probability of death. RESULTS: Lactic acidemia and metabolic base deficit are compared with the conventional hemodynamic variables of BP and cardiac output (Qt) as predictors of outcome and are shown to be superior using a modified Kaplan-Meier probability statistic. The LD50 for oxygen debt is shown to be 113.5 mL/kg, 12.9 mmol/L for lactate, and -18.8 mmol/L for base excess (BE). Comparison is made between the ability of Qt, BP, shed blood, BE, and lactate to predict oxygen debt. CONCLUSIONS: Of the single-variable predictors, BE shows the highest explained variability. However, a combined prediction from both lactate and BE appears superior to the use of either alone. Using this regression to compute the oxygen debt, it is possible to estimate accurately the actual level of oxygen debt from the BE and lactate values obtained during hemorrhagic hypovolemia. From serial determinations over time of the increase in these biochemical variables above the oxygen debt baseline, it is possible to estimate the rate of oxygen debt accumulation and the time remaining until the LD50 will be reached as indicators of the severity of the total body ischemia resulting from hemorrhagic shock. 
3	Untying the gordian knot: the genetics of Tourette syndrome. A review of the current status of the genetics of Tourette syndrome is presented. Over the course of the 104 years since Gilles de la Tourette described the syndrome that bears his name, a body of carefully collected, described, and analyzed data has produced a model of the genetics that implicates a single dominant gene that is variably penetrant in males and females. Moreover, the locus of action of this gene is most likely in the dopaminergic system of the midbrain. A systematic search for this gene using recombinant DNA techniques is under way. 
5	The diagnostic impact of prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography. STUDY HYPOTHESIS: It is feasible to apply prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography to most stable prehospital chest pain patients. Prehospital diagnostic accuracy is improved compared with single-lead telemetry. POPULATION: One-hundred sixty-six stable adult patients who sought paramedic evaluation for a chief complaint of nontraumatic chest pain. METHODS: One-hundred fifty-one prehospital 12-lead ECGs of diagnostic quality were obtained by paramedics on 166 adult patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain. Paramedics and base station physicians were blinded to the information on acquired prehospital 12-lead ECGs and treated patients according to current standard of care-clinical diagnosis and single-lead telemetry. Final hospital diagnoses were classified into three groups: acute myocardial infarction (24); suspected angina or ischemia (61); and nonischemic chest pain (66). Paramedics and base station physicians' clinical diagnoses and prehospital and emergency department ECGs were similarly classified and compared. Prehospital and ED 12-lead ECGs were read retrospectively by two cardiologists. RESULTS: Paramedics achieved a high success rate (98.7%) in obtaining diagnostic quality prehospital 12-lead ECGs in 94.6% of eligible prehospital patients. For patients with acute myocardial infarction, prehospital ECG alone had significantly higher specificity than did the paramedic clinical diagnosis (99.2% vs 70.9%; P less than .001), and significantly higher positive predictive value (92.9% vs 32.7%; P less than .001). For patients with angina, combining the paramedic clinical diagnosis and the prehospital ECG significantly improved sensitivity (90.2% vs 62.3%; P less than .001) and increased negative predictive value (88.9% vs 71.3%; P less than .02) compared with paramedic clinical diagnosis alone. There was a high concordance between prehospital and ED ECG diagnosis (99.3% for acute myocardial infarction and 92.8% for angina). Furthermore, ten patients whose prehospital ECGs demonstrated ischemia and who had final hospital diagnoses of angina or acute myocardial infarction were mistriaged by paramedics and/or received no base station physician-directed therapy. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to apply prehospital 12-lead electrocardiography to most stable prehospital chest pain patients. Prehospital 12-lead ECGs have the potential to significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy in chest pain patients, approach congruity with ED 12-lead ECG diagnoses, and may allow for consideration of altering and improving prehospital and hospital-based management in this patient population. 
4	The renally compromised older hypertensive: therapeutic considerations. Although the slow progression of renal insufficiency caused by aging does not usually reach the clinical disease level, nephron loss may be accelerated by the concomitant presence of hypertension and renal artery atherosclerosis. Treatment of hypertension and correction of other risk factors promoting atherosclerosis is appropriate in the elderly. Consideration should be given to a search for reversible causes of renal functional deterioration in elderly patients, particularly in those with increasingly refractory hypertension. In the uncomplicated elderly hypertensive, renal function appears to be adequately preserved if blood pressure is well controlled, although there may be a subset in whom factors other than blood pressure itself, such as glomerular hemodynamic disturbances, promote progressive renal dysfunction. 
1	Interaction between trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and methotrexate in children with leukemia. Because trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) causes neutropenia in children with leukemia, we investigated the possibility that pharmacokinetic interaction between methotrexate (MTX) and TMP-SMX causes accumulation of the antileukemia agent. We studied the pharmacokinetics of MTX given intravenously or orally to nine children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, once with and once without TMP-SMX. There was an increase in free MTX fraction during TMP-SMX therapy in all patients, from (mean +/- SD) 37.4 +/- 11% without TMP-SMX to 52.2 +/- 6.4% with TMP-SMX (p less than 0.01). Plasma clearance of total MTX did not change significantly, whereas clearance of free MTX decreased significantly (from 12.5 +/- 4 to 7.6 +/- 1.5 ml/kg/min; p less than 0.05). There was a consistent decrease in the renal clearance of free MTX (from 12.1 +/- 6.8 to 5.6 +/- 2.4 ml/kg/min; p less than 0.05). Elimination half-life of MTX was not affected significantly by TMP-SMX. There was a significant correlation between serum concentrations of TMP-SMX and the percentage of decrease in the renal clearance of free MTX (r = 0.91; p less than 0.05). These changes in protein binding and tubular clearance of MTX, caused by competition with TMP-SMX, result in a mean 66% increase in systemic exposure to MTX and may explain the myelotoxicity often observed with the coadministration of the two drugs. 
5	DNA aneuploidy in follicular thyroid neoplasia. The potential value of DNA aneuploidy, in distinguishing benign from malignant follicular thyroid neoplasms, was studied. The nuclear DNA content of 65 follicular thyroid neoplasms (52 adenomas and 13 carcinomas) was determined by flow cytometric analysis of paraffin embedded material; in 58 cases preparations were technically satisfactory. In 22 follicular neoplasms DNA analysis was also performed on fresh material obtained by fine needle aspiration of surgical specimens. Cell cycle analysis was performed on both fresh and fixed specimens. An aneuploid DNA profile was found on analysis of fixed tissue in eight of 45 (18 per cent) follicular adenomas and four of 13 (31 per cent) follicular carcinomas. DNA aneuploidy was also found in six of the 22 (27 per cent) fresh preparations from follicular adenomas. The frequency of DNA aneuploidy in apparently benign and malignant follicular neoplasms was similar. Follicular thyroid neoplasia are best regarded as a single entity with a low incidence of local and distant spread. All follicular neoplasia are therefore best excised. 
2	A small animal model of human Helicobacter pylori active chronic gastritis. Isolation of a spiral-shaped bacterium closely related to Helicobacter pylori from the cat stomach made it possible to investigate new small animal models of gastric infection. Pure cultures of this bacterium, provisionally named "Helicobacter felis," were fed to germ-free mice. The organism colonized the stomach in large numbers in mucus and deep in the gastric pits and showed the same gastric trophism found with H. pylori. Significant histopathology was seen in all H. felis-infected mice. At 2 weeks postinfection, an acute inflammatory response was seen composed primarily of eosinophils and neutrophils. At 3 weeks, the polymorphonuclear response was more pronounced with large numbers of neutrophils in some areas forming small microabscesses. Lymphocytes also increased in number. By 8 weeks, several relatively large lymphoid nodules were present in the submucosa. Multiple small microabscesses were still present in the pyloric mucosa. This is the first animal model of bacterial gastritis to be described that shows progression from acute inflammation to persistent acute on chronic inflammation (active chronic) as is seen in human infection with H. pylori. 
4	A multicenter study of doxazosin in the treatment of patients with mild or moderate essential hypertension and concomitant intermittent claudication. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of once-daily doxazosin in the treatment of patients (n = 19) with mild or moderate essential hypertension (sitting diastolic blood pressure [DBP] 95 to 114 mm Hg) and concomitant intermittent claudication (Doppler ankle/arm ratio of less than 0.80 and walking tolerance of less than 700 m on the treadmill). After 14 weeks of treatment with doxazosin, a significant (p less than 0.05) reduction in systolic blood pressure and DBP was observed. Mean blood pressures were reduced from 170/100 mm Hg at baseline to 161/93 mm Hg at the end of treatment. Minor changes in heart rate occurred, which with continued treatment were not statistically significant from baseline. In 12 of 16 (75.0%) efficacy-evaluable patients blood pressure was normalized (DBP to less than or equal to 90 mm Hg with an greater than or equal to 5 mm Hg reduction from baseline) with a mean daily dose of 7.6 mg/day. Doxazosin improved the hypertension severity category in 13 of 16 (81.3%) patients. The blood pressure ratios between both the thighs and arms and ankles and arms showed no statistically significant changes after treatment with doxazosin. Thigh blood flow at rest and the reactive hyperemia after 3 minutes of arterial occlusion did not change statistically. There was a tendency for pain-free distance to improve. Laboratory data were not significantly changed after treatment with doxazosin. Of the 19 patients studied, 5 reported mild or moderate side effects that were either tolerated or disappeared with continued treatment. No patient had therapy withdrawn and no patient required a dose reduction. 
2	Pyloric deformation from peptic disease. Radiographic evidence for incompetence rather than obstruction. We have used double-contrast radiographic techniques to clarify what changes in the configuration and movements of the gastroduodenal junction result when peptic lesions involve the distal gastric segment between the proximal (PPL) and the distal pyloric muscle loop (DPL). Among 50 cases of pyloric ulceration diagnosed during a four-year study period, 18 cases fulfilled all study criteria. Ulcers maintained a consistent location with regard to the muscular structures of the pylorus, and by affecting these structures, led to many strange deformations of the gastric outlet including permanent pseudodiverticula and reversal of pyloric angulation. The most common site for peptic lesions in the pyloric segment was the protuberance of the lesser curvature called the pyloric torus; many torus lesions extended into and destroyed the DPL. This led to widening of the gastric outlet and radiographic evidence of increased duodenogastric reflux. Pyloric closure was further impaired in this setting because the mucosa no longer prolapsed into the gastric outlet and did not occlude the pyloric lumen as it normally does. Less common lesions involved the greater curvature and the PPL. In one patient, scarring of the PPL led to an antral web and gastric hyperperistalsis. This was the only patient who required operation for chronic gastric outlet obstruction. One-third of the 18 patients had reflux esophagitis in addition to peptic pyloric disease. In most patients without additional ulcerogenic risk factors, treatment with antisecretory agents led to the healing of ulcer craters. We conclude that the morphologic and functional changes of the gastric outlet caused by peptic lesions depend, in part, on the effect the ulcer has on the underlying pyloric musculature. 
1	Mutational activation of the c-Ha-ras gene in liver tumors of different rodent strains: correlation with susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis. The frequency and pattern of mutations at codon 61 of the c-Ha-ras gene have been analyzed in 195 liver tumors and 132 precancerous liver lesions from various rodent strains with differing susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis. By using the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, C----A transversions at the first base and A----T transversions or A----G transitions at the second base of c-Ha-ras codon 61 were detected in 20-60% of spontaneous or carcinogen-induced liver tumors of the C3H/He, CBA, CF1, and B6C3F1 mouse strains, which are highly susceptible to hepatocarcinogenesis. No such mutations, however, could be found in any of the 31 liver tumors of the insensitive C57BL/6J and BALB/c mouse strains or in any of the 35 liver tumors of the comparatively resistant Wistar rat. Further analyses of c-Ha-ras codon 12 mutations in liver tumors from the three insensitive rodent strains also failed to give any positive results. In early precancerous liver lesions, c-Ha-ras codon 61 mutations were found in 13-14% of lesions of the sensitive C3H/He and B6C3F1 mouse strains but not in any of the 34 lesions of the insensitive C57BL/6J mouse. Taken together, our results indicate a close correlation between the mutational activation of the c-Ha-ras gene in liver tumors of the different rodent strains and their susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis, whereby the mutations appear to provide a selective growth advantage, leading to a clonal expansion of the mutated liver cell population, only in livers of sensitive but not of insensitive strains. 
1	The association of selected cancers with service in the US military in Vietnam. II. Soft-tissue and other sarcomas. The Selected Cancers Cooperative Study Group As part of a series of investigations into the health of Vietnam veterans, we conducted a population-based, case-control study of soft-tissue and other sarcomas between 1984 and 1988. All men born between 1929 and 1953 and diagnosed in an area covered by eight cancer registries were considered eligible. Controls were selected by random-digit dialing. Analyses of 342 men with pathologically confirmed sarcoma and 1776 controls showed that Vietnam veterans had a relative risk of 1.0 for sarcoma in comparison with men who did not serve in Vietnam (95% confidence interval, 0.6 to 1.6). Restriction of the analysis to the 254 men with soft-tissue sarcoma yielded a relative risk of 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5 to 1.6). Several attributes of military service in Vietnam (eg, branch, duration of service, military region, and other characteristics that may have been associated with the use of Agent Orange) were examined, and none was associated with an increased risk for the development of sarcoma. Furthermore, no morphologic type of sarcoma was overrepresented among Vietnam veterans. Results were unchanged if Vietnam veterans were compared with (1) other veterans or (2) men who never served in the military. This study, which had 97% power to detect a relative risk of 2.0 for all sarcomas, provides no evidence that the risk for the development of soft-tissue or other sarcomas is increased among veterans 15 to 25 years following service in Vietnam. 
3	Diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine and serious neurologic illness: an updated review of the epidemiologic evidence. A widespread impression that DTP vaccine does cause brain damage has been based first on historical precedent--smallpox and rabies vaccines were recognized as sometimes causing devastating neurologic illness; analogy to pertussis--the disease can cause encephalopathy; and more recently on anecdotal evidence, particularly case series. A noncausal relationship--coincidence--could explain the temporal relation between DTP vaccine and neurologic illness, inasmuch as DTP vaccine is given at the age of emergence of idiopathic neurologic disease. The relationship between DTP vaccine and neurologic illness lacks specificity. Case series have had an impact on both physicians' and the lay public's impression of the safety of pertussis vaccine greatly out of proportion to their scientific importance. Case series can be useful for generating hypotheses but cannot provide evidence that pertussis vaccine is causally related to acute neurologic illness or brain damage. Observational studies using cohort and ecologic designs did not find an association between DTP vaccine and serious neurologic illness, but they were not powerful enough to detect an association as rare as that observed by the NCES investigators. The case-control design offers the best chance of providing causal evidence regarding DTP vaccine and serious neurologic illness. The NCES is the only published case-control study of this issue. This study found a rare association between DTP vaccine and some types of acute neurologic illness. Bias and chance are unlikely to account entirely for the association demonstrated by the NCES. However, the association has not yet been replicated by other case-control studies. The NCES does not demonstrate that DTP vaccine causes permanent brain damage. 
4	Ultrasonic debridement during mitral valve reconstruction for calcified mitral stenosis. An ultrasonic device in conjunction with open mitral commissurotomy was applied in 8 patients with heavily calcified, stenosed mitral valves. In 6 patients, reconstruction of the mitral valve by debridement of the leaflet calcification with the device was successful. Two patients required valve replacement because of an increase in preexistent mitral regurgitation caused by excessive decalcification. The ultrasonic device proved to be a useful and effective adjunct for salvaging the heavily calcified mitral valve, which would otherwise have to be replaced. 
5	Acute compartment syndrome. Effect of dermotomy on fascial decompression in the leg. Prompt surgical decompression is the only means of preventing the late sequelae of ischaemic contracture in post-traumatic compartment syndromes. However, controversy exists regarding the length of dermotomy required for adequate decompression in the lower extremity. This study investigated the skin envelope as a potential contributing factor. Wide fascial releases were performed through limited 8 cm incisions in eight cases of post-traumatic lower extremity compartment syndrome. In nine of 29 compartments the pressure remained greater than 30 mmHg. Lengthening the skin incisions to an average of 16 cm decreased intracompartmental pressures significantly. This study documents the skin envelope as a contributing factor in acute compartment syndromes of the leg. The use of generous skin incisions is supported and the need for intra-operative compartment pressure measurements in the treatment of this condition is emphasised. 
4	Renal effects of cyclosporine. Renal dysfunction is a frequent consequence of cyclosporine administration, even when cyclosporine blood concentrations are maintained within proper therapeutic levels. As dermatologic indications for this compound expand, it is important for clinicians to understand the relevant pharmacology and physiology that underlie cyclosporine-induced renal dysfunction. This article reviews the clinical pharmacology of cyclosporine, the principles of renal function testing, and the clinical manifestations of this drug's effects on the kidney. Sudden declines in kidney function, long-term cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and hypertension are discussed from a clinical and experimental standpoint. Finally, practical suggestions are provided to aid the dermatologist in managing cyclosporine-treated patients. 
5	Hormonal-metabolic stress responses in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery. Hormonal and metabolic responses were measured in 15 neonates who underwent repair of complex congenital heart defects during a standardized anesthetic protocol. Four of the 15 neonates died postoperatively in the intensive care unit. Analysis of arterial plasma samples obtained before, during, and 24 h after surgery showed that plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, glucagon, and beta endorphin increased in all patients (P less than 0.05). Insulin levels increased only at the end of surgery but remained elevated for 24 h postoperatively (P less than 0.02). Intraoperative metabolic changes were characterized by hyperglycemia and lactic acidemia that persisted postoperatively. This pattern of neonatal stress responses is distinct from and more extreme than that seen in adult cardiac surgical patients. The four neonates who died postoperatively tended to have higher stress responses intra- and postoperatively despite having been indistinguishable from survivors by the usual clinical and hemodynamic criteria. These preliminary results suggest that neonatal hormonal and metabolic responses to cardiac surgical operations in neonates are extreme and are associated with a high hospital mortality rate. 
5	Computerized tomography as an indicator of isolated mesenteric injury. A comparison with peritoneal lavage. This study evaluated 18 patients with blunt abdominal trauma who suffered isolated mesenteric injuries, diagnosed at exploratory laparotomy. Thirteen had diagnostic peritoneal lavage (PL) as their initial diagnostic study, and five had computed tomography (CT). All patients who had positive PL were explored emergently, undergoing repair of mesenteric injuries. Three of the five patients with CT as initial studies had delayed recognition of their injuries due to incorrect initial interpretation of the scan in two, and a false negative scan in one. Two of these patients developed intestinal infarction and required bowel resection. There were no complications in the PL group related to surgery; morbidity was greater in those undergoing CT. We conclude that early laparotomy and repair of significant mesenteric injuries is necessary to reduce morbidity, and that PL is a more sensitive indicator of this injury than CT. 
4	Comparison of the effects of guanadrel sulfate and propranolol on blood pressure, functional capacity, serum lipoproteins and glucose in systemic hypertension. In a controlled, double-blind, crossover study, the effects of guanadrel sulfate and propranolol on blood pressure (BP) and selected cardiopulmonary and metabolic variables were compared in 15 physically active and moderately hypertensive subjects. Guanadrel sulfate reduced systolic and diastolic BP at rest by -16 and -15 mm Hg, and at maximal exercise by -33 and -13 mm Hg, respectively (p less than 0.005), without affecting submaximal oxygen consumption (VO2), maximal VO2, ventilatory threshold, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or fatigue, as assessed by perceived exertion. In contrast, propranolol significantly decreased diastolic BP at rest (-16 mm Hg) and systolic BP at maximal exercise (-44 mm Hg); however, it significantly decreased submaximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), maximal VO2 (-3.9 ml.kg-1.min-1), ventilatory threshold (-0.3 liters.min-1), minute ventilation at submaximal exercise (-7.3 liters.min-1), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (-0.27 liters), and concomitantly increased the rating of perceived exertion at maximal exercise (1.9 U). Guanadrel sulfate was also associated with significant decreases in mean fasting plasma glucose and total serum cholesterol, whereas propranolol resulted in an increase in serum triglycerides (p less than 0.05). In contrast to propranolol, guanadrel sulfate appears to decrease BP without evoking negative metabolic consequences or impairing exercise tolerance. 
4	Relationship between duration of spinal cord ischemia and postoperative neurologic deficits in animals. Stagnara wake-up tests, blood flow measures, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), and neurogenic-motor evoked potentials (NMEPs) were elicited from 20 hogs before and after spinal cord overdistraction at L3-L4. Overdistraction was maintained from 5 to 30 minutes after loss of NMEPs. Results suggest that the longer the duration of overdistraction the greater the likelihood of paraplegia. Blood flow measures indicated that reduced perfusion was greatest at the distraction site but extended proximally and distally. Finally, NMEPs were more sensitive to onset of overdistraction and a more valid indicator of paraplegia than SEPs. NMEPs should provide the surgeon with more time for initiation of intervention techniques than SEPs. Because NMEPs and SEPs provide information regarding different spinal cord tracts, the authors continue to use both methods for monitoring the functional integrity of the human spinal cord during corrective spine surgery. 
1	Immunotherapy. Neuroblastoma as a model. Combinations of aggressive therapy and radiotherapy directed at the primary tumor site as well as dose intensive chemotherapy against metastases can effectively induce complete remissions in patients with stage IV neuroblastomas. By virtue of its tumor specificity, the use of immunotherapy at the time when microscopic residual disease is present holds great promise in eradicating the tumors permanently. Monoclonal antibodies can accumulate selectively and at high concentrations in neuroblastomas. They have the potential of initiating complement activation and inflammation at the tumor site. Hematopoietic factors and cytokines can reinforce the body with tumoricidal leukocytes. Ex vivo activation of autologous white cells as well as arming by genetic manipulation can also produce tumor-seeking vehicles that may be therapeutically useful. As the knowledge of tumor and host immunobiology accumulates, the optimal combination of these approaches will become apparent. 
2	Distribution of cholesterol between vesicles and micelles in human gallbladder bile: influence of treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. The present study aimed at determining the relative distribution of cholesterol between the vesicular and micellar phases in gallbladder bile of gallstone patients (n = 23) and gallstone-free subjects (n = 7). Nine of the gallstone patients were treated with chenodeoxycholic acid and seven were treated with ursodeoxycholic acid, 15 mg/kg/day, for 3 wk before cholecystectomy. The vesicular and micellar fractions in bile were separated by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation, and a clear separation between the two phases was obtained. The vesicles were further identified by quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy and appeared to be of a uniform size with a mean hydrodynamic radius of 760 A. The proportion of cholesterol in the vesicular fraction was significantly higher in the untreated gallstone group (40% +/- 4%) compared with the gallstone-free (28% +/- 3%), ursodeoxycholic acid (28% +/- 3%) and chenodeoxycholic acid (18% +/- 4%) groups. Despite a low cholesterol saturation of bile in the latter three groups (88% +/- 12%, 51% +/- 9% and 65% +/- 5%, respectively), a considerable part of the biliary cholesterol was carried in the vesicular fraction. The cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in the vesicular fraction averaged between 0.49 and 0.58 in the gallstone, gallstone-free and chenodeoxycholic acid groups, whereas the ursodeoxycholic acid group had a significantly lower ratio of 0.24. The nucleation time of bile from the gallstone group was short (2 +/- 1 days) compared with the gallstone-free, chenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid groups (23 +/- 3, 24 +/- 6 and 14 +/- 3 days, respectively. 
4	Probability of rupture of an abdominal aortic aneurysm after an unrelated operative procedure: a prospective study. It has been assumed by some authors that patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms may be at increased risk of rupture after unrelated operations. From July 1986 to December 1989, 33 patients (29 men, 4 women) with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent 45 operations. Twenty-eight patients had an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm, and five patients had a thoracoabdominal aneurysm. The abdominal aortic aneurysm ranged in transverse diameter from 3.0 to 8.5 cm (average 5.6 cm). Twenty-seven patients underwent a single operation, and six patients had two or more (range of 1 to 6). Operations performed were abdominal (13); cardiothoracic (9); head/neck (2); other vascular (11); urologic (7); amputation (2); breast (1). General anesthesia was used in 29 procedures, spinal/epidural in 6, and regional/local in 10. One postoperative death occurred from cardiopulmonary failure. One patient died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm at 20 days after coronary artery bypass (1/33 patients [3%]; 1/45 operations [2%]). Fourteen patients had repair of their abdominal aortic aneurysm at a later date, an average of 18 weeks after operation. Four patients had abdominal aortic aneurysm considered too small to warrant resection (average 3.6 cm). Four patients were considered at excessive risk for elective repair. The five thoracoabdominal aneurysm were not repaired. Four patients are awaiting repair. During this same 40-month period, two other patients, not known to have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, died of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm after another operative procedure, at 21 days and 77 days. All three ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms were 5.0 cm or greater in transverse diameter. 
4	Effect of lesion characteristics on outcome of directional coronary atherectomy. Directional coronary atherectomy, a new transluminal procedure for treatment of obstructive lesions in coronary arteries by excision and removal of tissue, was performed on 447 lesions in 382 procedures. Successful outcome, defined as a reduction of stenosis by greater than or equal to 20% with a less than 50% residual stenosis, was achieved in 89.5% of lesions and mean stenosis was reduced from 75.9 +/- 13.3% to 14.5 +/- 22.1% (p less than 0.001). Complications included vessel occlusion during the procedure, 2.4%; vessel occlusion after the procedure, 1.3%; new lesion, 0.5%; nonobstructive guiding catheter-induced dissection, 0.3%; perforation, 0.8%; distal embolization, 2.1%; Q wave myocardial infarction, 0.8% and non-Q wave myocardial infarction, 4.2%. Twelve patients (3.1%) required coronary artery bypass surgery for these complications. The atherectomy success rate was greater than 80% and the combined atherectomy and angioplasty success rate was greater than 90% for complex morphologic features such as eccentric lesions, lengthy lesions, lesions with abnormal contour, angulated lesions, ostial lesions and lesions with branch involvement. In the presence of calcific deposition, atherectomy success rate was 52% for primary lesions and 83% for restenosed lesions. Among angiographically complex lesions, calcium was the predictor for failed atherectomy (p less than 0.0001). In summary, directional coronary atherectomy is safe and effective for treatment of obstructive lesions in coronary arteries in selected cases. In particular, it achieves a high success rate in lesions with complex morphologic characteristics, such as eccentricity, abnormal contour and ostial involvement. 
4	Does cholesterol screening result in negative labeling effects? Results of the Massachusetts Model Systems for Blood Cholesterol Screening Project. Several previous studies that looked at the effects of labeling individuals as hypertensive found increases in psychosocial distress, diminished feelings of well-being, or absenteeism. Other studies found no such effects. Thus far, similar studies relating to labeling for high blood cholesterol levels have not been published. The Massachusetts Model Systems for Blood Cholesterol Screening Project investigated whether labeling effects occurred as a result of the community-based screening, education, and referral programs it conducted in Worcester and Lowell. Nine questions concerning perceptions of physical and psychological well-being were asked on a questionnaire given to screening participants. The same questions were asked as part of a follow-up questionnaire given to all individuals identified as having high blood cholesterol levels at one of the screenings. Comparison of the baseline and follow-up results did not demonstrate significant overall negative effects among any age, sex, racial, income, or educational groups. On the contrary, responses to many of the questions revealed small but statistically significant improvements in perceptions of physical and psychological well-being. The absence of negative labeling effects may be attributable to the positive, supportive approach to participant counseling taken by the project. 
5	Indications of the carbon dioxide laser in tracheobronchial pathology of the infant and young child: 14 cases. Fourteen children aged between 6 months and 7 years (mean age = 3.5 years) were treated by CO2 broncholaser in the ENT Department of Trousseau Hospital. Three groups of diagnostic indication were identified: 1. Granulomas treated after mucosal trauma (tracheotomy, foreign body). 2. Granulomas due to pulmonary and/or lymph node tuberculosis. 3. Adhesions and stenosis secondary to neonatal ventilation. The operative and anesthetic technique is described in detail, together with any possible adverse events. The CO2 broncholaser appears to be a technique of choice in this age group, in which the narrowness of the airways makes any endoscopic procedure difficult. The broncholaser allows the early treatment of obstructive tracheobronchial pathology with its risks of severe ventilatory sequelae. 
4	Transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis of left atrial appendage aneurysm. Intrapericardial left atrial appendage aneurysm is rare. We describe the transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiographic findings in a 42-year-old man with atrial arrhythmia and an abnormal left atrial appendage on chest roentgenogram. Presence of an intrapericardial left atrial appendage aneurysm was confirmed at surgery. 
5	Continuing care for cancer pain relief with oral morphine solution. One-year experience in a regional cancer center. This report is a prospective study of 223 patients with intractable cancer pain who were offered continuing care during the year 1988 at the Pain Relief Unit, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India, with a minimum follow-up of 4 months and a maximum follow-up of 16 months. A high percentage of pain relief was attained within a mean duration of 4 days, which on follow-up was maintained at a steady level in most patients (91.1%). Oral morphine could not be continued in three patients because of vomiting. The main side effects noticed were nausea and vomiting, itching, and constipation. At any time during the first 140 days, only 30% of patients had side effects and appropriate medication successfully managed these side effects. During the rest of the study period, the side effects were minimal. Oral morphine used with proper adjuncts offers the best pain palliation in most patients, with minimal side effects. 
5	Abscess of the iliopsoas muscle diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography. We have reported a case of abscess of the iliopsoas muscle, in which a limp and hip pain pointed toward pathology of the hip. The diagnosis in such cases may be difficult unless there is close attention to the clinical history and a good physical examination is obtained. One ultrasonographic examination of the hip in such a patient, subtle differences between the iliopsoas muscles should alert the radiologist to examine the psoas muscle. Ultrasonography is instrumental in demonstrating the solid or cystic nature of the iliopsoas mass, while MRI depicts the extent and proximity of adjacent organs. Once an iliopsoas abscess is diagnosed, treatment includes parenteral antibiotics and drainage. 
5	Assessment of the risk of bleeding from esophageal varices by continuous monitoring of portal pressure. Portal pressure was monitored by means of an indwelling hepatic vein balloon catheter in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and bleeding varices to determine the safety and feasibility of the technique and its value in predicting recurrence of bleeding. Forty patients were enrolled. Central venous access could not be achieved in 4 patients (10%). Hepatic vein catheterization was accomplished in the remaining 36 patients. Fourteen patients were either later found to have nonalcoholic liver disease or had already received treatment that excluded them from the protocol. The remaining 22 patients, who were treated with blood and fluid replacement, were monitored for up to 72 hours. Portal pressure was greater than 11 mm Hg in all patients (normal, less than 5 mm Hg) and did not change significantly over the 3 days of study. Portal pressure was significantly higher in the 9 patients who continued to bleed or rebled compared with the 13 patients who remained stable. The lowest pressure associated with continued bleeding or rebleeding was 16 mm Hg. Continuous monitoring of portal pressure in patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to alcoholic cirrhosis is safe and feasible and permits rapid stratification of the risk of continued bleeding or early rebleeding. 
3	Spontaneous neurodegeneration in transgenic mice with mutant prion protein Transgenic mice were created to assess genetic linkage between Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and a leucine substitution at codon 102 of the human prion protein gene. Spontaneous neurologic disease with spongiform degeneration and gliosis similar to that in mouse scrapie developed at a mean age of 166 days in 35 mice expressing mouse prion protein with the leucine substitution. Thus, many of the clinical and pathological features of Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome are reproduced in transgenic mice containing a prion protein with a single amino acid substitution, illustrating that a neurodegenerative process similar to a human disease can be genetically modeled in animals. 
4	Exposure of the intracavernous carotid artery in aneurysm surgery. The pterional intradural approach was used in five cases of large and giant carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms and in two cases of intracavernous aneurysms that arose from the anterior siphon knee in the cavernous sinus (CS) and extended into the carotid cistern. In four cases of large carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms removal of the anterior clinoid process and the roof of the optic canal gave easy access to the pericarotid ring. The anteromedial part of the pericarotid ring was dissected to expose the extradural portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) proximal to the neck and to make enough room between the wall of the CS and the extradural portion of the ICA, thus allowing easy clipping of the neck. In one case of a giant carotid-ophthalmic aneurysm extending into the CS with an extradural origin of the ophthalmic artery and in two cases of an intracavernous aneurysm arising from the siphon knee, neck clipping was performed by opening the lateral wall and roof of the CS after removal of the optic strut. The opening of the lateral wall anterior to the 3rd nerve facilitated wide exposure of the anterior siphon knee. The horizontal portion of the intracavernous ICA as well as the whole aspect of the aneurysm could be exposed as a result of the extended opening of the cavernous roof anterior to the posterior clinoid process. Successful operative results were obtained in all seven patients. A visual field detect as an operative complication was noted in one patient. No disturbance of ocular movements was noted. 
1	TGF-alpha is widely expressed in differentiated as well as hyperproliferative skin epithelium. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is a potent mitogen for epithelial cells that is expressed at low levels in normal epidermis and overexpressed in psoriasis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to inhibit hair growth but stimulate the growth of sebaceous and sweat glands, suggesting a potential role for a member of the EGF/TGF-alpha family in the normal development and function of skin appendages as well as epidermis. The present work demonstrates TGF-alpha protein in eccrine ducts, and eccrine, sebaceous, and apocrine glands. The proliferative dermal hair bulb does not express TGF-alpha in contrast to the differentiated outer root sheath hair follicle epithelia. In addition, hyperproliferative skin diseases including bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, squamous cell carcinoma, and psoriasis show increased TGF-alpha expression. Thus, TGF-alpha may play a role in the morphogenesis and function of normal skin appendages and its overexpression is common in benign and malignant hyperproliferative skin diseases. 
2	Combined radiologic and retrograde endoscopic and biliary interventions. Methods of treating complex biliary duct problems by a team composed of an endoscopist and interventional radiologist are described. These procedures are of two types: Those in which all manipulations are performed through the endoscope and those in which an antegrade transhepatic and a retrograde endoscopic approach are combined. 
5	Frontal sinus carcinoma presenting as acute sinusitis. Primary carcinoma of the frontal sinus is extremely rare. The aetiology of the tumour remains obscure, and even with rapid diagnosis and radical surgery the prognosis remains very poor. 
5	Flow cytometric DNA content of adenoid cystic carcinoma of submandibular gland. Correlation of histologic features and prognosis. Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content was performed in 26 adenoid cystic carcinomas of the submandibular gland using archived, paraffin-embedded tissues. The DNA content was compared with multiple histologic parameters and clinical course. Ten carcinomas (38%) were aneuploid and 16 (62%) diploid. Aneuploid carcinomas demonstrated a higher frequency of solid cytoarchitecture, lymph node metastases, and advanced clinical stage, as compared with diploid carcinomas. Other histologic features predicting aggressive clinical behavior also correlated with abnormal DNA content and included invasion of nerves larger than 0.25 mm and intravascular extension. Our data suggest that DNA content analysis can be an effective objective parameter in the clinicopathologic assessment of adenoid cystic carcinoma. 
3	Oral contraception in disease states. Oral contraceptives are clearly contraindicated in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease, ischemic heart attack, or cerebral stroke. Patients requiring long-term anticoagulant treatment can be treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to prevent ovulation, because ruptured follicles can cause massive intraperitoneal bleeding. Patients with essential hypertension and severe liver diseases should also discontinue treatment 4 weeks before major elective surgery. Migraine and diabetes mellitus are regarded as relative contraindications, depending on the individual situation. Long-term diseases, such as Crohn's disease, epilepsy, and sickle cell anemia, also require individualized consultation. 
3	Nitrous oxide does not alter infarct volume in rats undergoing reversible middle cerebral artery occlusion. This experiment was designed to determine if nitrous oxide alters neurologic and pathologic outcome from temporary focal cerebral ischemia in spontaneously hypertensive rats deeply anesthetized with a barbiturate. Two groups of rats were given intravenous methohexital such that a stable EEG pattern of burst suppression was achieved. In one group of rats (n = 11), the lungs were mechanically ventilated with 70% N2O/30% O2, and in the other group (n = 10), ventilation was done with 70% nitrogen/30% O2. The middle cerebral artery was then occluded for 2 h, during which time mean arterial pressure, blood gases, hematocrit, plasma glucose, and head temperature were held constant between groups. The total doses of methohexital administered were similar in both groups as were the plasma methohexital concentrations immediately prior to onset of ischemia. After reperfusion of the middle cerebral artery, the animals were allowed to awaken. Neurologic evaluations were performed prior to ischemia and at 24 and 96 h postischemia. Cerebral infarct volume was measured at 96 h postischemia using triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining and computer imaging techniques. There were no neurologic differences between the N2O and nitrogen groups at any experimental interval although both groups exhibited deficits at both 24 and 96 h postischemia relative to preischemic values. The two groups also had nearly identical cerebral infarct volumes (N2O = 231 +/- 97 mm3; nitrogen = 226 +/- 75 mm3; mean +/- SD). 
2	Pancreatic involvement in human immunodeficiency virus infection. Involvement of the pancreas by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has not been adequately addressed and is the object of this review. I analyzed the English language literature, including single case reports of pancreatic involvement and larger series reporting detailed pathological findings of patients with HIV infection. Nonspecific pathological changes in the pancreas are frequently seen at autopsy of HIV-infected patients, but are not more common than in controls. Several types of infections (mainly cytomegalovirus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Mycobacteria) and neoplasms (lymphoma and Kaposi's sarcoma) can involve the pancreas because they are usually disseminated. Although the serum amylase may be elevated, the patient remains asymptomatic. Occasional instances of severe and even fatal pancreatitis have been reported with HIV infections and attendant drug toxicity. Pentamidine has a predictable incidence of hypoglycemic episodes and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine provokes pancreatitis in a minority of treated patients. Such drug toxicity seems to deserve greater clinical concern than opportunistic infections or neoplasms. 
4	Anti-atherosclerotic and vasculoprotective actions of calcium antagonists. Treatment of hypertension may prevent many of the complications attributable to blood pressure elevation, particularly those that are "pressure-related," such as stroke. However, the atherosclerotic complications of hypertension, e.g., coronary artery disease manifested as coronary morbidity and mortality, have not been reduced significantly with antihypertensive therapy. This disappointing outcome may reflect the adverse metabolic effects of the traditional therapies, diuretics and beta blockers, and their lack of specific vasoprotective properties. Increasing attention is thus being paid to the newer antihypertensive agents, which typically have fewer adverse effects and perhaps more physiologic mechanisms of antihypertensive action. Since calcium plays a key role in the genesis of atherosclerosis, calcium antagonists may positively affect the course of vascular disease. Investigators have observed that calcium antagonists display clear antiatherosclerotic properties in experimental as well as clinical studies. In one recently published clinical study, coronary artery disease was shown to develop more slowly, with a slower progression of individual stenoses, higher regression rate and less frequent occurrence of new lesions in patients treated chronically with verapamil compared to those receiving conventional therapies. Other similar investigations are currently under way to evaluate the antiatherogenic properties of calcium antagonists, including the Frankfurt Isoptin Progression Study (FIPS), the Multicenter Isradipine Diuretic Atherosclerosis Study (MIDAS), the International Nifedipine Trial on Atherosclerosis Coronary Therapy (INTACT), and the large-scale Montreal Heart Institute Study. Results of these studies, which use precise end points such as myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction and peripheral vascular disease, may revolutionize the treatment of hypertension by identifying therapeutic approaches that control both the pressure-related and atherosclerotic complications of the disease. 
5	Chiari pelvic osteotomy for osteoarthritis secondary to hip dysplasia. Indications and long-term results. Of 142 Chiari pelvic osteotomies for osteoarthritis in dysplastic hips, most performed by Chiari himself, we were able to review 82 and obtain information about 18 by questionnaire. All patients were over 30 years of age at operation; follow-up averaged 15.5 years. Twenty hips had undergone secondary total hip replacement. The outcome was good in 75%, fair in 9% and poor in 16%. High osteotomies all gave good results, and the result also depended on adequate medialisation. Statistics were worse for patients over 44 years of age at the time of operation. For osteoarthritis secondary to hip dysplasia, the Chiari pelvic osteotomy is an alternative procedure to early hip replacement. In contrast to intertrochanteric osteotomy, it has the advantage of facilitating the implantation of an acetabular prosthesis should arthroplasty become necessary at a later stage. 
3	Lymphoma, motor neuron diseases, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We studied 9 patients with motor neuron disease and lymphoma. The following several observations have not been recognized in the past: (1) Motor neuron syndromes are associated with either Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. (2) The syndromes are not restricted to lower motor neuron disorders; 8 of 9 patients had definite or probable upper motor neuron signs as well, qualifying for the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Corticospinal tracts were affected in both postmortem examinations. (3) The combination of motor neuron disease and lymphoma is often accompanied by paraproteinemia (3 of 7 patients studied), increased cerebrospinal fluid protein content (6 of 9 patients), and cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal bands (3 of 9 patients). (4) In 2 patients, asymptomatic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was found only because the discovery of paraproteinemia gave impetus to examine the bone marrow. (5) Patients with both upper and lower motor neuron signs (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) may show physiological evidence of conduction block in peripheral nerves or autopsy abnormalities in peripheral nerves. The cause of this syndrome is not known. Both lymphoma and motor neuron disease could have a common cause, possibly a retroviral infection. The frequency of paraproteinemia suggests that an immunological disorder may play a role in the pathogenesis of the neurological disorder. 
5	Controlled discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment for patients with panic disorder. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of discontinuing treatment with intermediate- and long-acting benzodiazepines. METHOD: Fifty patients with panic disorder who had taken part in a double-blind treatment study and had responded to alprazolam, diazepam, or placebo for 8 months were asked to stop taking these medications gradually. RESULTS: After a relatively rapid dose reduction, the majority of patients relapsed. Rebound anxiety and withdrawal symptoms were identified in a substantial minority of patients. Those who were taking alprazolam showed earlier and more intense rebound anxiety and withdrawal symptoms than did the patients who received diazepam. Both the level of pretreatment anxiety and the drug the patient was taking predicted the level of anxiety when drug treatment was discontinued. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that withdrawal phenomena commonly occur after patients stop taking benzodiazepines and that they are more frequent after discontinuation of treatment with shorter-acting drugs. 
3	Specificity of affective and autonomic symptoms of depression in Parkinson's disease. Previous investigators have suggested that numerous symptoms used to diagnose depression, such as sleep or appetite disturbance, are non-specific in medically ill patients, and alternative diagnostic criteria should be developed. In the study this hypothesis was tested in Parkinson's disease (PD) by comparing patients with PD who reported a depressive mood with patients having PD but without a depressive mood. Depressed patients showed a significantly higher frequency of both autonomic and affective symptoms of depression. Depressed patients with PD reported a significantly higher frequency of worrying, brooding, loss of interest, hopelessness, suicidal tendencies, social withdrawal, self-depreciation, ideas of reference, anxiety symptoms, loss of appetite, initial and middle insomnia, and loss of libido when compared with non-depressed patients. No significant between-group differences, however, were observed in the frequency of anergia, motor retardation, and early morning awakening. 
4	Splenic artery aneurysm rupture [published erratum appears in Am J Emerg Med 1991 Mar;9(2):205] Splenic artery aneurysms are rare and usually asymptomatic. However, rupture can produce severe abdominal pain and prove lethal. Two cases of ruptured splenic artery aneurysm are presented. In one, cocaine injection occurred immediately prior to the onset of symptoms and may have precipitated the event. 
5	A severe multisystem reaction to sulindac. We present a case of a severe reaction to sulindac. A 30-year-old woman with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus received sulindac for nonspecific migrating chest pain. An initial course of therapy produced an unrecognized sensitization to the drug with a febrile illness and rash. Readministration of the drug caused an anaphylactoid reaction as well as evidence of cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, and hematologic dysfunction. The patient's illness had evidence of types I, II, and III hypersensitivity reactions. 
5	Prognostic implications of DNA histogram, DNA content, and histologic changes of regional lymph nodes in patients with lung cancer. Forty-six cases of resected lung cancer, including 20 cases at Stages I and II and 26 cases at Stage III (N2), were subdivided into two groups: a good prognosis group with a longer survival period and a poor prognosis group in which the patients died earlier of the cancer. From paraffin-embedded lymph node tissues of these patients, the authors examined DNA histogram pattern and DNA content, using flow cytometry, and histologic hyperplasia of germinal center and paracortical area; they also evaluated their correlation with the prognosis. In the good prognosis group at Stages I and II, paracortical hyperplasia (PH) of the lymph nodes was observed significantly more frequently. In the good prognosis group at Stage III, the incidence of PH, G2M phase in the DNA histograms, and DNA content were all significantly higher. DNA content was positively correlated with the grade of PH. 
3	Ataxia and peripheral neuropathy: a benign variant of peroxisome dysgenesis. A 5-year-old boy with panperoxisomal dysfunction is described. Clinical features included hypotonia, areflexia, and ataxia. Cognition, vision, hearing, and hepatic function were normal. A panel of peroxisomal markers, including very-long-chain fatty acids, phytanic acid, pipecolic acid, and catalase compartmentalization, were abnormal. This is a uniquely benign syndrome of disordered peroxisome biogenesis. 
5	Amphotericin B vs high-dose ketoconazole for empirical antifungal therapy among febrile, granulocytopenic cancer patients. A prospective, randomized study. We compared high-dose ketoconazole (800 mg/kg per day, orally) with amphotericin B (0.5 mg/kg per day, intravenously) for empirical antifungal therapy in a prospective, randomized study of persistently or recurrently febrile granulocytopenic cancer patients. Among 97 patients eligible for empirical antifungal therapy, 20 (21%) of these patients were ineligible for randomization to ketoconazole treatment because of their inability to tolerate oral medications. Among 72 patients eligible for randomization, 64 were assessable (32 in each arm of the study). Five of six patients with proved fungal infections who were randomized to receive ketoconazole treatment required crossover to amphotericin B treatment because of progressive infection. The conditions of three of these five patients improved after receiving amphotericin B. The frequency of transaminase elevation was higher in those receiving ketoconazole, while the frequency of azotemia was higher in those receiving amphotericin B. Bioavailability of ketoconazole was unpredictable. Amphotericin B remains the drug of choice for empirical antifungal therapy in granulocytopenic patients; whereas, lack of a parenteral formulation, ineffectiveness against proved mycoses, and unreliable bioavailability preclude high-dose ketoconazole from being an appropriate compound for this purpose. 
1	Normal pituitary gland: coronal MR imaging of infundibular tilt. To determine the prevalence of pituitary infundibular deviation or tilt as a normal variant, coronal magnetic resonance (MR) images of 50 patients who had been examined for reasons other than pituitary disease were evaluated retrospectively. Forty-six percent of the patients had a more or less pronounced tilt of the pituitary stalk. This tilt was due to developmental lateral eccentricity of the pituitary gland in relationship to the midline of the brain in 34% and to ontogenic eccentric insertion of the pituitary infundibulum off the midline of the gland in the other 12%. This high frequency of stalk deviation in patients without pituitary disease suggests that such displacement by itself should not be used to support the presence of pituitary microadenoma on MR images or computed tomograms.
