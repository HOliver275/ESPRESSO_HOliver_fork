Fetal choroid plexus cysts in the second trimester of pregnancy: a cause for concern. Controversy surrounds the issue of recommending cytogenetic studies in second-trimester fetuses with fetal choroid plexus cysts. To assist in clarifying this issue, a prospective study was designed to describe the association between fetal choroid plexus cysts and aneuploidy in a large population. During a 3-year period 7350 women at 15 to 22 weeks' gestation underwent an ultrasonographic evaluation. Fetal choroid plexus cysts were diagnosed in 71 (0.96%) of these pregnancies. Sixty-two of the 71 patients elected to undergo amniocentesis. An abnormal karyotype was identified in four (6.4%) of these fetuses. One fetus had trisomy 21, and three fetuses were diagnosed with trisomy 18. These data indicate that it is reasonable to offer genetic counseling and cytogenetic studies in those patients identified as having a fetal choroid plexus cyst. 
Nutritional management of acute and chronic pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis often results in a catabolic state characterized by profound hemodynamic, metabolic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic, and renal aberrations. Parenteral nutrition and metabolic support are essential if morbidity and mortality are to be minimized. In chronic pancreatitis, nutritional management ranges from fundamental dietary manipulation with or without administration of appropriate digestive enzymes to enteral supplementation with modular chemically defined diets to total parenteral nutrition, depending on the stage, severity, and manifestations of the disease. In prescribing nutrient substrates in both acute and chronic pancreatitis, consideration must be given to their effects on pancreatic enzyme secretion if optimal results are to be achieved. 
Resting energy expenditure in patients with pancreatitis. OBJECTIVE: To assess the resting energy expenditure of hospitalized patients with pancreatitis. DESIGN: Prospective, case-referent study. SETTING: Nutrition support service in a university tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients referred to the Nutrition Support Service with the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Excluded from study entry included those with cancer, obesity (greater than 150% ideal body weight), those measured within 3 postoperative days, or patients requiring ventilator support with an FIO2 of greater than 0.5. Forty-eight patients with either acute pancreatitis (n = 13), chronic pancreatitis (n = 24), acute pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7), or chronic pancreatitis with sepsis (n = 7) were studied. The two septic groups were combined into a single pancreatitis-with-sepsis group, since no significant differences among measured variables were observed between individual septic groups. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry and compared with the predicted energy expenditure, as determined by the Harris-Benedict equations. Resting energy expenditure (percent of predicted energy expenditure) was significantly (p less than .02) greater for patients with pancreatitis complicated by sepsis (120 +/- 11%) compared with the nonseptic chronic pancreatitis group (105 +/- 14%). Resting energy expenditure for the nonseptic acute pancreatitis patients (112 +/- 17%) was not significantly different from the other groups. The septic pancreatitis group had the largest percentage (82%) of hypermetabolic (resting energy expenditure greater than 110% of predicted energy expenditure) patients, whereas 61% and 33% of the acute and chronic pancreatitis groups were hypermetabolic, respectively (p less than .02). CONCLUSIONS: Resting energy expenditure is variable in patients with pancreatitis (77% to 139% of predicted energy expenditure). The Harris-Benedict equations are an unreliable estimate of caloric expenditure. Septic complications are associated with hypermetabolism and may be the most important factor influencing resting energy expenditure in pancreatitis patients. 
Plasma catecholamines in patients with presinusoidal portal hypertension: comparison with cirrhotic patients and nonportal hypertensive subjects. During a hemodynamic study, plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured in the pulmonary artery and in the hepatic vein in 18 presinusoidal portal hypertensive patients. Results were compared with those in 15 nonportal hypertensive subjects and in 24 cirrhotic patients in good condition (grade A, according to Pugh's classification). Plasma norepinephrine concentrations in the pulmonary artery or in the hepatic vein were not significantly different between nonportal hypertensive subjects (mean +/- S.E.M.: 271 +/- 36 and 83 +/- 11 pg/ml, respectively) and presinusoidal portal hypertensive patients (273 +/- 33 and 84 +/- 11 pg/ml, respectively). These concentrations were, however, elevated in cirrhotic patients (408 +/- 47 and 256 +/- 45 pg/ml, p less than 0.05 in comparison with the two other groups). These differences suggest that increased sympathetic nervous activity in cirrhosis is associated with the presence of liver disease or increase in sinusoidal pressure. Differences in plasma epinephrine concentrations were not significant among the three groups of patients. However, the existence of a significant correlation between pulmonary artery plasma epinephrine concentration and cardiac index (r2 = 0.46, p less than 0.01) in patients with presinusoidal portal hypertension suggests that the adrenal medulla could play a role in the pathophysiology of the hyperkinetic syndrome of these patients. 
Efficacy of fixed minidose warfarin prophylaxis in total hip replacement. OBJECTIVE--To determine whether a small fixed perioperative dose of warfarin would prevent deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. DESIGN--Prospective, randomised, double blind placebo controlled trial. SETTING--Winford Orthopaedic Hospital, Bristol. SUBJECTS--148 patients having primary total hip replacement. INTERVENTION--Warfarin 1 mg given daily for one week before and three weeks after surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Deep vein thrombosis diagnosed by the iodine-125 labelled fibrinogen uptake method. RESULTS--Deep vein thrombosis occurred in 25 (34%) of the patients given warfarin and 19 (26%) of the controls (difference 8%; 95% confidence interval -6.8% to 22.8%). CONCLUSION--Fixed minidose warfarin does not prevent deep vein thrombosis after total hip replacement. 
Cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide salvage therapy for refractory or relapsing germ cell carcinoma. Thirty patients with metastatic progressive germ cell carcinoma who failed to be cured with first-line cisplatin chemotherapy were treated with a salvage regimen consisting of cisplatin 20 mg/m2, etoposide 100 mg/m2, and ifosfamide 1.2 g/m2 (PEI) intravenously (IV), days 1 to 5 every 3 weeks. Ten patients (33%) were tumor-free at the end of therapy. Complete response (CR) was achieved with chemotherapy alone in four patients and with additional surgery in six patients (two necroses, two mature teratomas, two carcinomas). Six patients (20%) had normalization of tumor markers but unresectable residual disease (Rm-), and the remaining 14 patients (46%) failed to respond. Of 10 patients with CR, nine (90%) relapsed again (eight carcinomas, one mature teratoma). The median duration of CR was 3.5 months. The median survival of the whole group was 311 days (range, 110 to 996+). Currently, seven of 30 patients are alive, and five of them are without signs of progressive tumor. The response to prior cisplatin therapy predicted for response and survival after PEI salvage therapy. Of 14 patients with prior CR, eight (57%) achieved a second CR compared with one of 11 (9%) with prior unfavorable response (P = .039). The median survival for patients with prior favorable response was 400 days, compared with 251 days for patients with prior unfavorable response (P less than .001). Myelosuppression was dose-limiting, with leukopenia greater than grade 2 in 84% and thrombocytopenia greater than grade 2 in 51% of all cycles. This three-drug regimen can induce a second CR in one third of patients with relapsed or refractory germ cell carcinoma. Only those patients with prior favorable responses can expect to be cured by this salvage regimen, while patients with prior unfavorable response should be considered for alternative salvage approaches. 
Scrub and murine typhus in children with obscure fever in the tropics. Between October, 1985, and February, 1987, 28 (8.7%) cases of scrub and murine typhus were diagnosed among 320 children with greater than or equal to 1 week history of obscure fever. Scrub typhus is a rural disease and characterized by fever, tachypnea and hepatosplenomegaly. Skin rash was rare and eschar was absent. Four patients had pneumonia and two had meningitis. Murine typhus, more an urban disease, was milder and half the patients presented exclusively because of night fever. Slightly enlarged liver and skin rash were the only significant physical signs. Lacking the classical textbook presentations, both rickettsioses often were missed or diagnosed as enteric fever. Recognition is important because patients with either disease respond well to treatment with chloramphenicol or doxycycline. 
Spectrum of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in immunocompetent patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a well-recognized complication in immunocompromised patients, especially those with neutropenia. We report four cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in patients whose main underlying disease was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Two patients had an acute fatal course, one had chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis ending in an acute fatal course, and the other had a semiacute disease that responded to amphotericin B. Autopsy on three patients showed invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in both lungs, and tissue invasion was documented by transbronchial biopsy in the patient who survived. Retrospective review of all cultures that grew Aspergillus species from bronchoscopic specimens showed no false-positive results, and this procedure proved to be the most useful maneuver in making the diagnosis. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis should be in the differential diagnosis in patients with COPD and unexplained pulmonary infiltrates. 
The possibility of diagnosing small pancreatic cancer (less than 4.0 cm) by measuring various serum tumor markers. A retrospective study. Comparative studies measuring various tumor markers such as SPan-1, CA 19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), DUPAN-2, and elastase I were done in 74 patients with small pancreatic cancer including 23 cases of T1 pancreatic cancer (tumor size less than 2.0 cm) and 51 cases of T2 pancreatic cancer (tumor size between 2.1 to 4.0 cm), retrospectively. Although the mean value of these tumor markers in T1 and T2 pancreatic cancer were higher than those of the control cutoff levels, their sensitivities were different. In T1 pancreatic cancer, 13 of 23 cases (56.5%) of SPan-1 and 14 of 23 cases of (60.7%) of CA 19-9 had levels above normal. Although the numbers of patients were small, sensitivities of CEA, DUPAN-2, and elastase I were 30.8%, 22.2%, and 28.6%, respectively. In T2 pancreatic cancer, 41 of 51 cases (80.4%) of SPan-1 and 40 of 51 cases (78.4%) of CA 19-9 showed higher levels than normal, but only 46.9% of CEA, 40.0% of DUPAN-2, and 52.6% of elastase I were positive. The overall sensitivities in small pancreatic cancer (less than 4.0 cm) were 73% for SPan-1 and CA 19-9 but were less for CEA, DUPAN-2, and elastase I. These results indicate that even small pancreatic cancers release detectable pancreatic cancer-associated antigens in serum in more than 70% of cases, especially SPan-1 and CA 19-9. The measurement of these two tumor markers makes it possible to detect small pancreatic cancers after using imaging diagnostic procedures. 
Paracentesis with intravenous infusion of albumin as compared with peritoneovenous shunting in cirrhosis with refractory ascites. BACKGROUND. There is no satisfactory treatment for refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis. Both peritoneovenous shunts and paracentesis have been used, but there is uncertainty about their relative merits. METHODS. We studied 89 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who were randomly assigned to receive either repeated large-volume paracentesis plus intravenous albumin or a LeVeen peritoneovenous shunt. Patients in the paracentesis group in whom recurrent tense ascites developed during follow-up were treated with paracentesis, and those in the peritoneovenous-shunt group with diuretic agents or by the insertion of a new shunt if there was shunt obstruction. RESULTS. During the first hospitalization, ascites was removed in all 41 patients in the paracentesis group and in 44 of the 48 patients in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The mean (+/- SD) duration of hospitalization in the two groups was 11 +/- 5 and 19 +/- 9 days, respectively (P less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in the number of patients who had complications or died. During follow-up, 37 patients in each group were hospitalized again. In the paracentesis group, the number of rehospitalizations for any reason (174 vs. 97 in the peritoneovenous-shunt group) or for ascites (125 vs. 38) was significantly higher, and the median time to a first readmission for any reason (1 +/- 1 vs. 2 +/- 2 months) or for ascites (2 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 17 months) was significantly shorter than in the peritoneovenous-shunt group. The total times in the hospital during follow-up, however, were similar in the two groups (48 +/- 49 and 44 +/- 39 days, respectively). Three patients had obstructions of their peritoneovenous shunts during their first hospitalizations, and 15 patients had a total of 20 obstructions during follow-up. Survival was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS. The LeVeen shunt and paracentesis are equally effective in relieving refractory ascites. The former may provide better long-term control of ascites, but shunt occlusion is common and survival is not improved. 
Percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters: comparison of sonographically guided and blind techniques. We studied the value of sonographically guided puncture of the subclavian vein for placement of indwelling right atrial and permanent subcutaneously tunneled catheters (Hickman) for long-term venous access. The commonly used blind puncture is associated with complications such as pneumothorax, arterial puncture, and hemothorax. The results and complications of 40 sonographically guided punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations of the subclavian vein (group 1, 31 patients) performed in the radiology department were compared with those of 40 blind percutaneous punctures and fluoroscopically controlled catheterizations (group 2, 29 patients) performed in the operating room. The patients were selected consecutively. The groups were comparable in age, sex, and indication for catheter placement; administration of chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies was the major indication (group 1, 84%; group 2, 83%). All punctures in group 1 were successful; group 2 had two failures (5%). Puncture-related complications occurred significantly more in group 2 (10%) than in group 1 (0%) (p less than .05). These complications were pneumothorax in three cases and hemothorax in one. Complications not related to the puncture technique were prolonged bleeding at the entrance site (groups 1 and 2, two cases each), local infection (group 1, one case), thrombosis (group 1, three cases; group 2, two), catheter sepsis (group 1, 10 cases; group 2, 14), catheter occlusion (group 2, three cases), and catheter migration (groups 1 and 2, two cases each). We conclude that sonographically guided puncture increases the success rate and significantly decreases the puncture-related complications of percutaneous placement of Hickman catheters. 
Effect of incisional biopsy on subsequent histology of melanocytic naevi. We examined the effect of incisional biopsy on the subsequent histology of 15 benign melanocytic naevi. In all cases the histology of the residual lesion within the second specimen was unchanged apart from the presence of a surgical scar, and in general the definitive excision specimen showed a reduction in melanocytes at the dermo-epidermal junction overlying the scar. In no case were there any features suggestive of melanoma. 
A double-blind crossover study of the effect of concomitant diuretic therapy in hypertensive patients treated with amlodipine. Twelve patients with essential hypertension who were already on treatment with the long-acting calcium antagonist amlodipine (5 mg once daily) were entered into a double-blind, randomized crossover study of the addition of one month's treatment with either bendrofluazide (5 mg once daily) or matching placebo. The addition of bendrofluazide did not cause any statistically significant fall in the supine blood pressure compared to treatment with placebo (147.6/90.1 +/- 4.8/2.8 v 150.8/92.6 +/- 4.3/2.3 mm Hg, respectively). Plasma potassium was significantly lower on bendrofluazide as compared to placebo (3.11 +/- 0.14 v 3.62v +/- 0.13 mmol/L, P less than .001) and 10 of 12 patients had a fall in plasma potassium while on diuretic. The results of this study suggest that a thiazide diuretic has little additive effect on blood pressure in patients already on the long-acting dihydropyridine amlodipine, and may cause hypokalemia. 
Acute otitis media in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children. To evaluate the occurrence and outcome of acute otitis media (AOM) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected children, a prospective comparative cohort study was performed. Twenty-seven HIV-infected children were individually matched with paired control subjects and followed up for 543 months (mean 19.4 +/- 11). Data collected were evaluated considering HIV-infected children both as a whole and as P1 and P2 patients according to Centers for Disease Control classification. During the observation period, 46 episodes of AOM were diagnosed in 15 HIV patients and 22 in 16 control children: 11 P1 had 27 AOM episodes vs 17 in 13 control children; 6 P2 had 19 AOM episodes vs 5 in 4 control children. Human immunodeficiency virus infection does not seem to modify the occurrence of AOM. Recurrent AOM (3 or more episodes in 6 months) was, however, significantly more common in P2 children. Amoxicillin, to which the bacteria isolated in P2 children were sensitive in vitro, cured 33 of 46 episodes in HIV-infected children compared with 20 of 22 in control children. Cure rate was similar in P1 children compared with control children but was significantly lower in P2 versus control children (47.3% vs 100%). Reasons for higher occurrence of failures in P2 children remain to be investigated. 
Angioscopic coronary macromorphology in patients with acute coronary disorders. To investigate the pathogenesis of acute coronary disorders and to clarify what type of plaque precedes these disorders, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioscopy, by means of a new angioscope, was carried out during catheterisation in 100 consecutive patients anatomically suitable for such investigations. The quality of the angioscopic image was good enough for analysis in 84 patients (14 with acute myocardial infarction [within 8 h of onset], 16 with recent myocardial infarction [3 days-2 months since onset], 24 with old myocardial infarctions, 10 with unstable angina, and 20 with stable angina). Thrombi were observed in most patients with acute coronary disorders (all 14 with acute myocardial infarction, 9 of 10 with unstable angina). Occlusive thrombi were more common in patients with acute myocardial infarction than in those with unstable angina (11 [79%] vs 1 [10%]; p less than 0.001), whereas mural (non-occlusive) thrombi were more common in the unstable angina than in the acute myocardial infarction group (8 [80%] vs 3 [21%]; p less than 0.001). Xanthomatous ulcerated plaques or ragged irregular surfaces were seen in patients with acute coronary disorders and in those with recent myocardial infarction. Xanthomatous plaques were more common in patients with acute coronary disorders (50%) than in those with stable angina (15%) or old myocardial infarction (8%). By contrast white and smooth plaques were seen in cases of stable angina and old myocardial infarction. Angioscopy could display the intracoronary lumen more precisely than could coronary arteriography. This angioscopic study suggested that, although a thrombus overlying a rupture in the lining of the plaque was common in both unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction, the character of the thrombus may differ between these disorders, and lipid-rich xanthomatous plaque may precede rupture. 
Cholecystectomy as a risk factor for colorectal adenomatous polyps and carcinoma. Multiple studies have suggested a possible relationship between prior cholecystectomy and the occurrence of subsequent colorectal carcinoma. This relationship has been particularly noticed among female patients and for right-sided lesions of the colon. In the current study, the authors undertook a case-control study among patients who underwent colonoscopy in three private practices in New York City between April 1986 and March 1988. Over this period, 302 adenomatous polyp cases, 106 colon cancer cases, and 507 controls were interviewed regarding their prior history of cholecystectomy. Overall, no significant association was observed between cholecystectomy and either colorectal adenomatous polyps or cancer. Cholecystectomy does not appear to be a significant risk factor for colorectal neoplasia. 
In vitro selection of a cell line for resistance to lysis by tumor necrosis factor-alpha selects for reduced tumorigenicity. Experimentally, TNF-alpha can mediate the hemorrhagic necrosis of certain tumors. Furthermore, evidence indicates that natural cytotoxic (NC) activity, a cell-mediated cytolytic activity that utilizes TNF-alpha in the lysis of target cells, is involved in preventing the outgrowth of certain NC/TNF-alpha-sensitive tumor cells. These observations raise the issue of whether soluble TNF-alpha normally serves as a tumor surveillance mechanism preventing the outgrowth of some tumors. To address this issue, we have used TNF-alpha to select TNF-alpha-resistant variants from the NC/TNF-alpha-sensitive mouse fibroblast cell line 10ME. Previously, we have demonstrated that 10ME is tumorigenic in immune-deficient mice but fails to form tumors in normal mice. Moreover, selection of NC-resistant variants from 10ME selects for both TNF-alpha resistance and tumorigenicity in normal mice. As cells that have been selected for NC resistance form tumors in normal mice, whereas the NC-sensitive parental cell line does not, it seems that escape from NC activity is sufficient to significantly increase the tumorigenic potential of the cell line. We show that the selection with TNF-alpha, although associated with NC resistance, does not increase the tumorigenic potential of 10ME cells but reduces it. Thus, NC activity appears to function as a mechanism to prevent tumor formation, and escape from NC activity allows for tumor formation; TNF-alpha does not have similar activity. Moreover, this suggests that NC activity is not equivalent to soluble TNF-alpha activity, but utilizes TNF-alpha more efficiently than soluble TNF-alpha, or NC activity involves both TNF-alpha and other effector mechanisms. 
Autoimmune enteropathy and nephropathy with circulating anti-epithelial cell antibodies. We describe a child with circulating anti-epithelial cell antibodies, autoimmune enteropathy with intestinal villous atrophy, and membranous glomerulonephritis. The patient had persistent diarrhea at 6 months of age, and a small bowel biopsy showed active enteritis, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia. When the patient was, 10 months of age, nephrotic syndrome developed because of membranous glomerulonephritis. Results of tests for circulating immune complexes were negative. Indirect immunofluorescence studies revealed a circulating antibody directed against renal epithelial cells. Circulating antibodies directed against normal small intestine epithelial cells were also detected by the immunoperoxidase technique. Western blot and immunoprecipitation identified a 55-kd antigen, in both small bowel and kidney, that reacted with an antibody in the patient's serum. High-dose prednisone therapy induced a clinical remission, resolution of the small bowel injury, and diminished serum anti-epithelial cell antibodies; after dose reduction, clinical relapse occurred with villous atrophy and reappearance of anti-epithelial cell antibodies. When the patient was 45 months of age, persistent diarrhea recurred despite intravenous administration of corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and total parenteral nutrition. Autoantibodies to a 55-kd epithelial cell protein are temporally related to the development of enteropathy and nephropathy. Study of similar patients is needed to determine the role of such antibodies in this disorder. 
A significant association of Ha-ras p21 in neuroblastoma cells with patient prognosis. A retrospective study of 103 cases. To evaluate biologic characteristics of neuroblastoma, the authors examined the expression of Ha-ras gene (Ha-ras p21) in 103 primary tumors obtained at the time of diagnosis. Higher expression of the Ha-ras p21 in tumor cells showed a significant association with lower clinical stage of the tumor at diagnosis (chi-square = 35.418, degrees of freedom [df] = 9, P less than 0.001) and survival of the patients (chi-square = 37.111, df = 3, P less than 0.001). Thirty-six (84%) of 43 patients with decreased Ha-ras p21 expression died of aggressive disease. The Ha-ras DNA was examined in the 32 tumors by Southern blot analysis. Neither augmentation nor deletion of the Ha-ras DNA was observed. Amplification of the N-myc DNA was also examined in 43 cases in comparison with Ha-ras p21 expression. N-myc amplification was detected in 12 (55%) of 22 patients who died, and 19 (86%) of the 22 patients showed a low expression of the Ha-ras p21 in tumor cells. Eighteen (86%) of 21 survivors showed a high expression of the Ha-ras p21. The expression of Ha-ras p21 was thought to be a clinically important marker for prognosis in children with neuroblastoma. 
The efficacy and tolerability of CV 205-502 (a nonergot dopaminergic drug) in macroprolactinoma patients and in prolactinoma patients intolerant to bromocriptine. We studied the effect of CV 205-502 in 12 patients with macroprolactinomas and 8 patients with PRL-secreting tumors, who were selected because of previous repeatedly shown intolerance to bromocriptine in even small doses. We also investigated serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels before and during CV 205-502 therapy. In 12 macroprolactinoma patients followed for 1 yr, 0.075-0.450 mg CV 205-502 lowered PRL levels by 91.2 +/- 5.4%. Only 3 of the patients had transient side-effects of nausea, dizziness, or fatigue. In eight patients with PRL-secreting tumors who were bromocriptine intolerant, CV 205-502 (0.075-0.300 mg daily) lowered PRL levels by 80.2 +/- 6.3%. Four of these patients showed transient side-effects (nausea, fatigue, and/or tachycardia). None of the patients discontinued therapy. There was a close correlation between pretreatment circulating PRL levels and tumor size, expressed in cubic millimeters. The decrease in pituitary tumor size after 52 weeks of CV 205-502 therapy (-74 +/- 6%) was also correlated with the decrease in PRL levels (P less than 0.01). In four patients with hypopituitarism, lowered IGF-I levels did not change during CV 205-502 therapy. However, in seven previously untreated patients with macroprolactinoma and normal CV 205-502 is a potent dopaminergic drug, which effectively controls PRL secretion and induces tumor shrinkage. At the doses used in our study, it causes only mild and transient side-effects in a minority of patients and can also be used to treat hyperprolactinemic patients who have shown intolerance to bromocriptine therapy. 
Chronic diffuse infiltrative lung disease: comparison of diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution and conventional CT. We compared the accuracies of high-resolution CT (HRCT) and conventional CT in determining the specific diagnoses in 75 consecutive patients with chronic diffuse infiltrative lung disease. Without knowledge of clinical or pathologic data, two reviewers independently assessed three separate sets of CT scans in random order: three HRCT scans, three 10-mm collimation CT scans obtained at the same levels as the HRCT scans, and a complete conventional CT scan. The HRCT scans were obtained at the level of the aortic arch, tracheal carina, and 1 cm above the right hemidiaphragm by using 1.5-mm collimation and a high spatial resolution algorithm. Observers gave the most likely diagnosis along with their degree of diagnostic confidence. The correct diagnosis, irrespective of confidence level, was reached with 71% of the HRCT scans and with 72% of both the corresponding 10-mm and complete conventional CT scans. Confidence level 1 (definite) was reached with 49% of HRCT scans, 31% of corresponding 10-mm scans, and 43% of complete conventional CT examinations; the correct diagnosis was made in 92%, 96%, and 94% of those examinations, respectively. In none of the patients were findings on the limited HRCT scan normal when findings on the conventional CT scan were abnormal. We conclude that in most patients with chronic infiltrative lung disease a specific diagnosis can be made by obtaining a limited number of HRCT scans. 
Stereotactic craniotomy in the resection of small arteriovenous malformations. Surgical resection of 10 obscure arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) was accomplished with craniotomy guided by computerized tomography (CT) or angiography and the use of the Brown-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame. Stereotactic craniotomy was invaluable for resection of the following types of AVM's: 1) AVM's with a nidus less than 2 cm in diameter, 2) AVM's located in an eloquent area of the brain, and 3) AVM's located deep in the brain. Stereotactic localization of these AVM's on preoperative radiological studies provides a precise route to the nidus, often avoiding important areas of the brain. This series included six male and four female patients with a mean age of 32 years. All patients presented with an intracerebral hemorrhage, from which eight made a complete neurological recovery prior to surgery. Two AVM's were located on the cortex, three were found subcortically, and five were situated near the ventricles or in the deep white matter. As a guide, angiography was used in six cases and CT in four cases. In each instance, the study providing the best image of the AVM nidus was employed. Postoperatively, no neurological deficits were found in eight patients and, in the two patients with preoperative deficits, neurological improvement was observed after recovery from surgery. Postoperative studies revealed complete removal of the AVM in all patients, and all lesions were confirmed histologically. The authors conclude that stereotactic craniotomy provides the optimum operative approach for the localization and microsurgical resection of AVM's that are either obscure or located deep in the brain. 
Abnormal esophageal motility. An analysis of concurrent radiographic and manometric findings. The findings of concurrent esophageal videofluoroscopy and manometry in 15 patients with major disturbances of esophageal motor function were evaluated and the data were analyzed from a fluid mechanical perspective. Each of 153 fluoroscopic barium swallow sequences was analyzed on a swallow-by-swallow basis. Two distinct pressure domains were identified: intrabolus pressure and pressure within a bolus-free contracting esophageal segment. Analyses in terms of these pressure domains showed specific and consistent correlations between the radiographic and manometric findings. Radiography was insensitive to contractions occurring in esophageal segments devoid of bolus fluid, whereas manometry was insensitive to contractions that did not occlude the lumen. It is concluded that using fluid mechanical principles of bolus transport allows meaningful comparison of esophageal motility as recorded by radiography and intraluminal manometry. However, the inherent limitations in the range of physical phenomena recorded by each modality make these techniques complementary for evaluating esophageal motor function. 
Doppler estimation of changes in pulmonary artery pressure during hypoxic breathing. To assess the use of Doppler echocardiographic screening for abnormal pulmonary vasoreactivity, we measured pulmonary artery pressure in 10 adult patients and 11 normal subjects while recording Doppler right ventricular outflow acceleration time, pre-ejection period, and ejection time. In the normal subjects we also measured the changes in each parameter after 10 minutes of hypoxic breathing (FIO2 = 0.12). Mean pulmonary artery pressure increased by 39% during hypoxia (13 +/- 4.3 to 18 +/- 5.4 mm Hg). In the patients and normal subjects at rest, mean pulmonary artery-pressure correlated well with acceleration time (r = -0.84; standard error of the estimate, 6.6 mm Hg; p = 0.0001). Over the narrow range of mean pulmonary artery pressure in normal subjects at rest, mean pulmonary artery pressure did not correlate well with acceleration time, acceleration time/pre-ejection period, or acceleration time/right ventricular ejection time. However, changes in mean pulmonary artery pressure induced by hypoxic breathing did correlate with changes in acceleration time/right ventricular ejection time (r = 0.73; standard error of the estimate, 2.3 mm Hg; p = 0.01). Doppler ultrasound may offer a noninvasive means for detecting abnormal pulmonary vasoreactivity in asymptomatic individuals at risk for developing pulmonary hypertension. 
Laparoscopic trancystic choledocholithotomy as an adjunct to laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is rapidly becoming the standard operation for symptomatic cholelithiasis. Initially, common duct stones presented a barrier to this treatment modality and are said to be unsuspected in 5-9 per cent of patients. A technique is described that removes common bile duct stones through the cystic duct with a flexible nephroureteroscope, thereby extending the range of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma. A worldwide problem and the major risk factors. Male sex, age, cirrhosis, and HBsAg are the major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The geographic distribution of HCC is highly uneven, such that three distinct incidence areas are recognized. To clarify the reason(s) for this geographic variability of HCC, the risk factors in each incidence area were assessed. In parallel with the geographic distribution of HCC, HBsAg prevalence was highest in both HCC patients and in general population in Africa and Asia, where mothers of HCC patients are frequently HBsAg-positive, suggesting that hepatitis B virus hyperendemicity and perinatal infection account for the high HCC incidence in these areas. Cirrhosis, which is found on autopsy in 80% of the cases of HCC patients worldwide, is the most prevalent risk factor for HCC in areas where hepatitis B virus infection is less common. However, HBsAg carriage adds to the HCC risk carried by cirrhosis and explains the higher incidence of HCC in cirrhotics from Africa and Asia as well as elsewhere. Available data suggest that chronic HCV infection is a risk factor for cirrhosis and HCC. HBV vaccination should decrease HCC incidence rates worldwide; however, HCC prevention in regions where HBsAg carriage is infrequent may also require prevention of the other causes of cirrhosis in order for HCC rates to decline. 
Linkage analysis of juvenile parkinsonism to tyrosine hydroxylase gene locus on chromosome 11. We performed linkage analyses of juvenile parkinsonism with autosomal recessive inheritance (AR-JP) to chromosome 11p15.5 locus including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), Harvey-ras-1 (HRAS), and insulin (INS) genes by analyzing genomic DNA from 28 members of seven Japanese AR-JP families containing 10 affected individuals. We used the methods of pairwise linkage analysis (LIPED) and multipoint linkage analysis (LINKAGE) for genetic linkage to the chromosome 11p15.5 markers and detected recombination events between AR-JP locus and TH gene. Multipoint linkage analysis excluded the linkage in the interval between TH and HRAS, as well as 11 cMo distal to TH and 8.5 cMo distal to HRAS, a total of approximately 23 cMo on chromosome 11p. 
Usefulness of leg-crossing for maintaining blood pressure in a sitting position in patients with orthostatic hypotension--case reports. The authors report a case with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension in which the patient prevents his blood pressure from falling to a symptomatic level by leg-crossing in a sitting position. Including 4 other patients with orthostatic hypotension and 5 normal subjects, their study found that the changes in blood pressure with leg-crossing inversely correlated with those induced by assuming seated posture from a supine position. Leg-crossing may, therefore, be one of the useful nonpharmacologic measures for maintaining blood pressure in a sitting position in patients with orthostatic hypotension. 
Intratumoral T lymphocytes from small cleaved follicular center cell lymphomas show unrestricted T-cell receptor alpha-chain variable region gene usage. The relationship between the reactive T cells and neoplastic B cells of follicular center cell lymphomas is unclear. It is not known whether the T cells are recruited nonspecifically by the neoplastic B cells or are responding through the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), to tumor-related antigen(s). This question was addressed by polymerase chain reaction analysis of TCR alpha chain variable (V) region gene expression in intratumoral T lymphocytes from three cases of small cleaved follicular center cell lymphoma. In all three cases studied, the tumor-associated T cells showed unrestricted expression of all 18 alpha-chain V region genes. These findings imply that the T cells admixed with the neoplastic B cells of small cleaved follicular center cell lymphomas are not recruited based on TCR recognition of a single or limited number of tumor-related antigens. 
Mechanisms and management of stroke in the elderly. OBJECTIVE: To highlight the mechanisms, common causes and management of stroke in the elderly. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE was searched for articles published from 1967 to 1990. The following key words were used: "stroke," "cerebrovascular disease," "elderly," "aging," "hypertension," "drug interactions," "etiology," "evaluation," "management" and "recovery of function." Original articles with large series of patients were reviewed in detail. STUDY SELECTION: Of about 750 original articles reviewed 116 were finally selected for detailed analysis. Those that dealt with cause, pathophysiologic features and management of stroke with emphasis on the elderly were chosen. DATA SYNTHESIS: With increasing age the incidence of stroke increases, cardiovascular reserve decreases, catecholamine responsiveness diminishes and cardiac arrhythmias become more common. Blood pressure, especially systolic, rises, and the benefits of its treatment become both more difficult to assess and less certain. In the elderly population embolic stroke, particularly that due to nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, is seen with increasing frequency. Because of postural hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias and overmedication, watershed infarction occurs more frequently with increasing age. Amyloid angiopathy now represents the most common cause of spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Because of the altered drug metabolism and pharmacodynamics in the elderly the therapeutic armamentarium is growing, and so are the risks of such treatments. Stroke in the elderly poses unique problems that deserve distinctive solutions. Further research is needed to study the effect of cerebral ischemia to understand better how the older brain handles the stress of the ischemic insult. 
Gastro-oesophageal reflux in mechanically ventilated preterm infants. Long duration oesophageal pH recordings were performed on 42 mechanically ventilated and parenterally fed preterm infants for a mean (SD) of 94 (28) hours. Their mean (SD) gestational age was 31.5 (2.6) weeks and birth weight 1514 (448) g. Their mean postnatal age was 19 (10) hours at the onset of pH recording, which was performed with the babies supine. The mean hourly values for the total number of episodes of gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) was 2.3 (2.7), for acid GOR 1.2 (1.4), and for acid GOR longer than 5 minutes 0.08 (0.09). The time the pH was greater than 4 (the reflux index) was 3.5 (3.3)% and the mean airway pressure was 6.6 (5.1) cm H2O. Fifteen infants had a reflux index above 5%. GOR patterns were not significantly correlated to birth weight, gestational age, postconceptional age, ventilatory patterns, and duration of mechanical ventilation. We concluded that the reproducibility of the reflux index was low because the median of the absolute differences was 1% when two consecutive 12 hour periods were compared and reached 2.5% when the two periods were separated by 96 hours. A second 24 hour pH recording was performed in 30 of the 42 patients after weaning from the ventilator and at a time when patients were asymptomatic and enterally fed. Compared with the late postprandial period of the second pH recording, the first recording showed an increase in the number of episodes of GOR and a decrease in reflux index, without any difference in the number of episodes of acid GOR. 
A critical threshold of exercise capacity in the ventilatory response to exercise in heart failure. During exercise patients with chronic left heart failure ventilate more than normal individuals at the same workload; the ratio of minute ventilation to minute production of carbon dioxide (VE/VCO2) is increased. The relation between increased VE/VCO2, severity of heart failure, and exercise capacity has not been defined. VE/VCO2 was measured in 47 patients with chronic left heart failure (New York Heart Association grades II and III) and in 1009 healthy controls. Exercise capacity was assessed by peak oxygen consumption (VO2max) during progressive exercise. In the controls VO2max ranged from 25 to 93 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 17-36 and did not correlate with VO2max. In chronic left heart failure the VO2max ranged from 9 to 29 ml/kg/min; VE/VCO2 was 22-42 and correlated strongly with VO2max. End tidal carbon dioxide and respiratory rate at peak exercise were similar in the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure. The increase in VE/VCO2 on exercise in chronic left heart failure indicates increased physiological dead space, presumably caused by a ventilation-perfusion mismatch. In the controls and patients with chronic left heart failure the relation of VE/VCO2 to VO2max was curvilinear with a threshold of VO2max below which VE/VCO2 started to rise above the normal range. This point of inflection may be explained by the existence of a critical level of cardiac function necessary to perfuse adequately all lung zones on exercise. 
Transsphenoidal management of Rathke's cleft cysts. A clinicopathological review of 10 cases. We report detailed data on 10 patients who underwent transsphenoidal microsurgical management of histopathologically confirmed Rathke's cleft cysts. Preoperatively, pituitary dysfunction was present in 90%, headaches in 80%, hyperprolactinemia in 70%, and visual interference in 40%. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging had 90% and 100% sensitivity, respectively, in disclosing the lesion. The mean follow-up duration was 22 months. There was no mortality. The only morbidity was sustained diabetes insipidus in one case. Resolution or improvement in preoperative dysfunction occurred in the majority of patients: headaches in 100%, visual deficits in 75%, normalization of hyperprolactinemia in 83%, and reversal of panhypopituitarism in 33%. We conclude that Rathke's cleft cysts can be managed safely and effectively with transsphenoidal drainage and partial excision of the wall. 
Correlation of technetium-99m-DISIDA hepatobiliary studies with biopsies in liver transplant patients. We compared 76 99mTc-DISIDA hepatobiliary studies with corresponding liver biopsies in 36 liver transplant patients to determine the histopathologic abnormalities that corresponded to scintigraphic abnormalities in uptake and excretion. Uptake was judged normal if the cardiac blood pool was barely visible or invisible on the ten minute image. Excretion was judged normal if images subsequent to the 15-min image showed a subjectively normal rate of decreasing parenchymal intensity. Biopsies were graded subjectively for hepatocyte damage and for findings of cholestasis. Uptake criteria were successful in differentiating high from low hepatocyte damage scores (p less than 0.0001), and excretion criteria were successful in differentiating high from low cholestasis scores (p = 0.002), while uptake criteria were not capable of differentiating high from low cholestasis scores, nor were excretion criteria capable of differentiating high from low hepatocyte damage scores (p's greater than 0.05). These results suggest that scintigraphy can distinguish intrahepatic cholestasis from pure hepatocyte damage. 
Psychologic factors associated with peptic ulcer disease. Peptic ulcer disease provides an excellent model for the study of mind-body interactions in the pathogenesis and course of an illness. Early psychodynamic explanations of the role of personality factors in the evolution of peptic ulcer disease have been supplemented in recent years by more scientifically based studies on the role of stress and coping ability. Multiple psychosocial variables have confounded the outcome of many of these studies. Yet, a clear need and guidelines exist for the comprehensive medical and psychosocial evaluation and treatment of patients with peptic ulcer disease. Concomitant psychiatric assessment and management, including psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic approaches, for those patients with refractory symptoms or ongoing psychiatric symptoms carried out in close collaboration with primary caregivers will significantly decrease overall morbidity and mortality. 
The preferential antagonism of pentylenetetrazole proconflict responses differentiates a class of anxiolytic benzodiazepines with potential antipanic action. With the use of the shock-induced suppression of water drinking in thirsty rats (Vogel's conflict paradigm) and the pentylenetetrazole-enhanced shock-induced suppression of drinking (proconflict paradigm) as animal models to test anxiolytic and antipanic agents, it was possible to distinguish two major classes of benzodiazepines (BZDs) and congeners on the basis of their antiproconflict index (ratio of anticonflict/antiproconflict potencies). Thus, typical low potency BZDs and congeners (diazepam, midazolam, zolpidem, alpidem) with anxiolytic/hypnotic properties have a low antiproconflict index (close to 1), whereas typical high potency BZDs (clonazepam, alprazolam, bretazenil) with reported antipanic properties have an antiproconflict index approximately 10-fold higher. The anticonflict and antiproconflict actions of BZDs with low or high antiproconflict indices are blocked by flumazenil but are potentiated differentially by the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) reuptake blocker 1-2-[bis(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]-methoxyethyl-1,2,5,6-tetrahydro-3- pyridine-carboxylic acid. Protracted administration of antianxiety and antipanic antidepressant drugs that do not act on GABAA receptors, directly, resulted in anticonflict and antiproconflict effects. However, the efficacy of these drugs is clearly inferior (20-30%) to that of BZDs. These data suggest that specific GABAA receptor subtypes mediate the pharmacological action of BZDs possessing low and high antiproconflict indices. 
Early loss of astrocytes in herpes simplex virus-induced central nervous system demyelination. Immunohistochemistry was used to study herpes simplex virus type 1-induced central nervous system demyelination in the trigeminal root entry zone of mice inoculated with herpes simplex virus type 1 by the corneal route. There was no change in peripheral nervous system myelin as shown by immunostaining for Po glycoprotein. Double immunoperoxidase staining for herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens and glial fibrillary acidic protein showed that most of the infected cells were astrocytes. Glial fibrillary acidic protein immunostaining was completely lost in the inferior medial portion of the trigeminal root entry zone at 6 days after herpes simplex virus type 1 inoculation, a time when central nervous system myelin was preserved as indicated by immunostaining for myelin basic protein. The pattern of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining did not change and herpes simplex virus type 1 antigens were no longer detected after day 8. There was a progressive loss of myelin basic protein staining within the area unstained by glial fibrillary acidic protein antisera on days 8 to 14. This pattern of astrocyte loss before central nervous system demyelination is strikingly different from the reactive astrocytosis seen in other demyelinating lesions, such as acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or acute multiple sclerosis. Herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in mice provides an unusual model of acute central nervous system demyelination preceded by a loss of astrocytes. 
Cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity during delayed vasospasm in a canine model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. While the in vitro reactivity of cerebral conducting vessels following subarachnoid hemorrhage has been extensively studied, in vivo cerebrovascular CO2 reactivity has not been systematically investigated. We tested the hypothesis that, in the canine model of subarachnoid hemorrhage, the rise in cerebral blood flow normally seen with hypercapnia is blunted during delayed vasospasm. Four groups of animals were studied: one received two 4-ml subarachnoid injections of nonheparinized arterial blood into the cisterna magna (n = 8), one received three subarachnoid injections of 5 ml blood (n = 5), one received two subarachnoid injections of 4 ml saline (n = 5), and a control group (n = 5) had no subarachnoid injections or angiography. Basilar artery diameter was measured from baseline and follow-up angiography. We determined CO2 reactivity by randomly varying the concentration of inspired CO2 and measuring regional cerebral blood flow with radiolabeled microspheres. Basilar artery diameter was not affected by saline injection and was reduced by 26 +/- 2.9% in the two-hemorrhage group and 55 +/- 1.9% in the three-hemorrhage group. Baseline cerebral blood flow and CO2 reactivity were similar in all four groups. We conclude that, in this model of delayed vasospasm, regional cerebral vascular CO2 reactivity is intact and extrapolation of in vitro data regarding basilar artery diameter and reactivity to cerebral blood flow must be done cautiously. 
ABO blood groups and the risk of diarrhea due to enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli. To determine whether blood group O persons are at higher risk for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) diarrhea, a case-control study was done for 17 months among rural Bangladeshis who were under systematic surveillance for diarrhea. Cases were children less than 3 years old who presented between 1 January 1985 and 1 June 1986 for care of heat labile (LT) or heat stabile toxin-producing ETEC diarrhea. Controls were of similar ages and were randomly selected from three community-based serosurveys between July 1985 and May 1986. No association between blood group O and ETEC diarrhea was found for the 510 cases and 641 controls, nor was an association evident for cases of each toxin phenotype. Further refinement of the case definition to include only patients with LT-ETEC diarrhea, without enteric copathogens, also failed to reveal a substantial association with blood group O. These data suggest that a strong association with ABO groups, analogous to that for cholera, does not exist for ETEC diarrhea. 
Alleged brain damage, diminished capacity, mens rea, and misuse of medical concepts. As focus on the insanity defense diminishes, defendants may place emphasis on a lack of knowing or purposeful behavior in order to negate a criminal charge. This use of a mens rea defense in accord with Model Penal Code principles is exemplified by the current New Jersey statute. Such a defense may result in a lesser charge or a finding of not guilty. In addition to reviewing applicable law, this report presents a sex offense case in which remote brain damage was invoked as a purported basis for incapacity to formulate the required intent; the study also raises the issue of the inappropriate or questionable use of medical principles, a practice that diminishes professional credibility in the courts and in the community. 
Regulation of Ras-GAP and the neurofibromatosis-1 gene product by eicosanoids. Ras-GAP (GTPase activating protein) is a regulatory protein that stimulates the intrinsic guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activity of the proto-oncogene product p21ras. A domain of the neurofibromatosis gene product (NF1) that has sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of Ras-GAP and to yeast IRA gene products also has a specific stimulatory activity toward p21ras GTPase. Arachidonic acid and phosphatidic acid inactivate GAP, but no agents have been identified that stimulate GAP and thereby switch p21ras off. With the use of recombinant Ha-c-Ras and Ras-GAP, NF1, and GAP catalytic domains, it was found that prostaglandins PGF2 alpha and PGA2 stimulated Ras-GAP and that prostacyclin PGI2 inhibited Ras-GAP. The stimulatory effect of PGF2 alpha was saturable and structure-specific and competed with the inhibitory effect of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid also inhibited the catalytic activity of NF1, but prostaglandins were not stimulatory. These results suggest a mechanism for the allosteric control of Ras function through the modulation of arachidonate metabolism. 
Treatment of male genital condylomatous lesions by carbon dioxide laser after failure of previous nonlaser methods. Carbon dioxide laser was used to treat 119 male patients with condylomata acuminata after other treatments had failed. In 82.3% of the patients, the treatment resulted in complete disappearance of the lesions, whereas in the others two to three treatments were required. Advantages of the laser treatment are discussed. 
Effects of quinapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on left ventricular failure and survival in the cardiomyopathic hamster. Hemodynamic, morphological, and biochemical correlates. The effect of chronic therapy with quinapril on the temporal progression of left ventricular failure and survival was assessed in the CHF 146 cardiomyopathic (CM) hamster, which is an idiopathic model of congestive heart failure. Age-matched Golden Syrian (GS) hamsters served as normal controls. Quinapril was administered in the drinking water at average daily doses of 10.2, 112.4, and 222.4 mg/kg/day. In untreated CM hamsters, in vitro left ventricular performance progressively deteriorated with increasing age beginning at roughly 180 days. This decline in left ventricular performance was accompanied by a decrease in coronary flow and an increase in left ventricular volume. Administration of quinapril from 180 to 300 days of age prevented the decline of in vitro left ventricular contractile performance and coronary flow and also reduced the age-dependent increases in left ventricular volume. The cardioprotective effects of quinapril were observed at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day. Lung angiotensin converting enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by quinapril in GS and CM hamsters at 240 and 300 days of age at all dose levels. In contrast, significant inhibition of ventricular angiotensin converting enzyme activity was observed consistently at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day quinapril but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day. In the survival protocol, CM and GS hamsters were treated with vehicle or quinapril (100 mg/kg/day) from 180 to 522 days of age. During the initial 210 days of treatment (from 180 to 390 days of age) 78.3% of the vehicle-treated CM hamsters died compared with 27.7% of quinapril-treated CM hamsters. Quinapril increased the median survival time of CM hamsters by 32.9% (112 days). It is concluded that chronic quinapril therapy exerts a significant cardioprotective effect and also increases survival. 
Two-point fixation of the lumbar spine. Differential stability in rotation. Single vertebral motion segments were tested in torsion. The adjacent vertebrae were transfixed by two 3-mm Steinman pins placed vertically. These were applied in five different positions: between the anterior vertebral bodies, posterior vertebral bodies, pedicles, transverse processes, and lamina. Rotational displacement was limited the most by transfixation between the vertebral bodies (position one or two). Disrupting the anulus fibrosus significantly increased rotation in all positions except those in the vertebral body. These findings may imply that spinal fixation devices that engage the vertebral bodies may offer inherent advantages over purely posterior devices in stabilizing a vertebral motion segment. In addition, an interbody arthrodesis may prevent intervertebral motion better than a posterior or posterolateral fusion. 
The nutcracker syndrome: new aspects of pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to study vascular anatomy in 3 patients with the nutcracker syndrome and in 10 healthy volunteers. From these studies an abnormal branching of the superior mesenteric artery from the aorta was identified as being the cause of the nutcracker syndrome. Consequently, surgical transposition of the left renal vein to achieve an unobstructed renal venous backflow was performed successfully in 2 patients, while 1 underwent nephrectomy. In 1 patient adjuvant ureteral instrumentation became necessary to aid occlusion of persisting shunts between peripelvic venous varicosities and the urinary tract. Awareness of the pathophysiology of the nutcracker syndrome ensures an early diagnosis, which should be confirmed by a combination of diagnostic procedures, including MRI. 
Course of brittle diabetes: 12 year follow up. OBJECTIVE--To determine the course of brittle diabetes. DESIGN--12 year follow up of patients identified in 1977-9 as having brittle diabetes; retrospective review of the case notes. SETTING--Nottingham health district. SUBJECTS--25 brittle diabetic patients were identified in 1979-9; 11 (five men) had three or more admissions with ketoacidosis between June 1977 and 1979 and 14 (eight men) had three or more attendances at the accident and emergency department with hypoglycaemia in 1978. Two controls from our diabetic register were matched to each patient for age, sex, and duration of diabetes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Frequency of ketoacidosis and severe hypoglycaemia in the 12 years after ascertainment; diabetic control and complications in 1988-90; retrospective attribution of the cause of brittleness. RESULTS--Patients with recurrent ketoacidosis had had a median (range) of 28 (8-67) episodes. One man died of a cerebral tumour but five of the surviving nine patients had not been admitted in the past two years, although diabetic control remained poor (median haemoglobin A1 concentration 14%). Seven patients had pure hypoglycaemic brittleness, and five had also had eight or more admissions with ketoacidosis (mixed brittleness). Two died of uraemia within a year after ascertainment and two others in hypoglycaemic coma seven and 12 years later. Brittle diabetes was in most cases related to a specific situation, usually unhappiness at home or school. CONCLUSIONS--Brittle diabetes is often episodic and almost always related to stressful life circumstances. Once the underlying cause is removed it tends to improve. Recurrent hypoglycaemic brittleness of psychological origin has a poor prognosis. 
Whole-abdominal irradiation for the management of gastrointestinal and abdominal manifestations of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia. A patient with a long-standing history of agnogenic myeloid metaplasia developed weight loss and ascites secondary to gastric/small bowel infiltration and peritoneal implants of myeloid tissue. Moderate doses of radiation were very effective in controlling her gastrointestinal symptoms. In contrast to previous reports, clinical improvement after irradiation was a slow, gradual process, requiring 5 months for complete resolution of the patient's ascites. Hematologic suppression may be profound and careful attention to the rate of change in leukocyte and platelet counts is necessary to avoid severe toxicity. 
Twenty five years of case finding and audit in a socially deprived community. OBJECTIVE--To evaluate audit and case finding (whole population care) in a community over 25 years. DESIGN--Contemporary screening for and audits of care of chronic disease and risk factors; retrospective review of computerised practice records; and comparisons of mortality and social indices with neighbouring communities. SETTING--One general practice in Glyncorrwg, West Glamorgan. SUBJECTS--1800 people registered with the practice in 1987 and 558 people who died from 1964 to 1987, whose records had been retained. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Detection of high blood pressure, smoking, airways obstruction, obesity, diabetes, and alcohol problems in adults aged 20-79; prevalence of smoking in this population and in hypertensive and diabetic groups; age standardised mortality ratios in relation to indices of social deprivation. RESULTS--In the population aged 20-79 (1207 patients) 249 (21%) had peak expiratory flow rate less than 50% of expected value or which improved by 15% or more with an inhaled beta agonist, 207 (17%) had body mass index at or over 30 kg/m2, 118 (10%) had untreated mean arterial pressures greater than 159/104 mm Hg (three readings), 80 (7%) (65 (16%) men, 15 (4%) women) had recognised alcohol problems, and 35 (3%) had diabetes. The proportion of men aged 20-64 who said they smoked fell from 61% (290/476) in 1968-70 to 36% (162/456) in 1985 whereas that of women who smoked was unchanged (43%, 187/436 v 42%, 190/448 respectively). In 116 screened hypertensive patients group mean blood pressure fell from 186/110 mm Hg before treatment to 146/84 mm Hg at 1987 audit, as did the proportion of smokers (56% v 20%), but body mass index and total cholesterol concentration showed no significant change. In 34 diabetic patients mean blood pressure and the proportion of smokers fell (171/93 mm Hg v 155/81 mm Hg; 44% v 12%). The age standardised mortality ratio in 1981-6 was lower than in a neighbouring village without a developed case finding programme (actual to expected deaths less than 65 = 21 to 22 in Glyncorrwg, 48 to 30 in control village). CONCLUSIONS--Whole population care through organised case finding and audit is feasible but only with a labour intensive approach combining accessibility, flexibility, and continuity, as well as a planned and structured approach, which requires substantial expansion of staff numbers and assiduous recording. It may reduce risks for at least some high risk groups. Despite their shortcomings the available data are consistent with the hypothesis that whole population care helps reduce mortality. Incentives in the new contract, which encourage the uncritical development of structured process, may diminish health outputs. 
Sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia. Nonulcer dyspepsia is a common clinical syndrome whose etiology is unknown. The sensitivity of the gastric mucosa to acid and duodenal contents in 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia was studied. The patients had a normal upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and biopsy specimens were obtained for determination of Helicobacter pylori status. Fifteen of the 18 patients were infected with H. pylori. All patients underwent intubation with double-lumen tube and collection of cholecystokinin-stimulated pancretico-biliary secretions. Subsequently, normal saline, 0.1N hydrochloric acid, and autologous duodenal secretions were infused into the stomach in a randomized blinded fashion. A positive response was defined as the production of epigastric pain by acid and/or bile but not by saline. By this definition, only 6 patients (33%) had a positive response and none had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In patients with a negative response, only 4 remained asymptomatic during all infusions. The remaining 8 had symptoms during infusion of saline, 7 of whom also had symptoms during infusion of acid and/or duodenal secretions. Two of these patients had reproduction of their usual symptoms. In conclusion, the gastric mucosa in patients with nonulcer dyspepsia is not abnormally sensitive to acid or duodenal contents. 
Cell-cycle-related staining patterns of anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen monoclonal antibodies. Comparison with BrdUrd labeling and Ki-67 staining. Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to nuclear antigens are increasingly used as tools to obtain valuable information concerning the proliferative characteristics of various types of cancer. Prerequisite for the application of these MAbs in surgical pathology is establishment of the level of expression and/or cellular distribution of the antigens in relation to distinct cell-cycle compartments. In this study the topologic distribution of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an auxiliary protein of DNA polymerase delta, as recognized by human autoantiserum (AK) and two recently developed MAbs (19A2 and 19F4), was evaluated. Using cultured human cancer cells as a model system, and providing optimal fixation/permeation procedures are applied, these antibodies display a high affinity for PCNA bound to nuclear replicon clusters, resulting in distinct granular staining patterns. A more diffuse nucleoplasmic PCNA staining was mainly restricted to non-S-phase cells; in methanol-fixed cells, staining intensity of this form relative to the replicon-bound form appeared higher after staining with 19A2 than with 19F4 or AK. Comparing PCNA expression (detected with 19A2) with the expression of the Ki-67 antigen, PCNA-negative cells are also Ki-67 negative. In MCF-7 human breast cancer cells treated with 10(-6) mol/l (molar) tamoxifen, the fraction of nuclei showing replication patterns decreased from 42% to 8% within 8 days, but PCNA and Ki-67 antigens remained detectable in most cells during this interval, indicating a relatively slow decrease of antigen expression in cells that have entered a quiescent state. Treatment of MCF-7 cells with 10(-6) mol/l methotrexate resulted in a rapid accumulation of cells with an early S-phase DNA content; PCNA replication patterns showing a frequency distribution reflecting this DNA content were observed up to 48 hours after treatment. This indicates that the presence of replication patterns as visualized with anti-PCNAs is not a measure of replicative activity per se. It is concluded that, providing nuclear non-S-phase PCNA staining is faint relative to staining of replicon clusters, anti-PCNA antibodies may be excellent markers to detect in situ cells with S-phase DNA contents. 
Acute myocardial infarction associated with prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 is rarely associated with serious maternal side effects when used for second-trimester pregnancy termination. Acute myocardial infarction complicating therapeutic pregnancy termination with prostaglandin E2 in a patient with chronic glomerulosclerosis and severe hypertension is reported. 
Continuous spinal anaesthesia for abdominal surgery in a patient receiving amiodarone. The perioperative management of a 57-yr-old patient receiving chronic amiodarone therapy with a continuous spinal anaesthetic for a low anterior resection of the colon is discussed. The most appropriate anaesthetic technique for patients receiving chronic amiodarone therapy remains controversial, but the avoidance of general anaesthesia may be beneficial because of the risk of postoperative pulmonary failure. In this patient continuous spinal anaesthesia was slowly titrated to the desired level, coincident haemodynamic alterations were easily treated as they developed, and high serum local anaesthetic concentrations which occur with other regional anaesthetic techniques were avoided. 
Submaximal endurance exercise performance during enalapril treatment in patients with essential hypertension. In a double-blind randomized crossover study of 10 patients with mild essential hypertension, the influence of antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (a single dose of 10 mg.day-1) on submaximal endurance exercise performance at a work rate eliciting a heart rate of 150 beats/min was studied. Resting and exercise blood pressure were significantly reduced during enalapril therapy. Heart rate was unaffected. Submaximal endurance exercise performance was reduced by 12% (p = 0.06). Plasma lactate concentrations were significantly increased and serum nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were decreased during exercise in patients receiving enalapril treatment. Plasma glucose and potassium levels and serum glycerol concentrations were not influenced by enalapril treatment. Because the impairment of endurance performance during enalapril treatment is relatively small compared with the reductions caused by other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents or diuretics, it is of minor clinical importance for most physically active patients with hypertension. 
Stage distribution of breast cancer: a basis for the evaluation of breast screening programmes. Stage at presentation can be predictive of future mortality rates. A change in stage distribution will be indicative of the effect of a programme. All registrations for 1985 aged over 50 years were staged from case notes and, to assess whether a stage drift is already occurring, cases that presented in 1975 were also staged. The accuracy and completeness of the Wessex Cancer Register for this particular cancer was assessed and further sources of registration identified. There was a significant difference between 1975 and 1985 stage distributions. If the Southampton and Salisbury service achieves the same success as the Gavleborg County trials, 4.61 deaths will be prevented at 5 years for each annual cohort of cases. For individual breast screening programmes, effectiveness is better monitored by analysis of stage distribution than of mortality rates. 
Transfalcine approach to a callosomarginal artery aneurysm. We describe a transfalcine approach to clipping and subsequently excising an expanding mycotic callosomarginal aneurysm. The patient had a devastating dominant (left) hemispheric spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage and was neurologically improving at the time of surgery nearly 2 months later. To avoid retracting the left hemisphere, we approached this left callosomarginal aneurysm from the nondominant side through the falx. The approach was straight-forward, and the result was satisfactory. 
Preherpetic neuralgia. We have encountered six zoster patients whose pain preceded rash by 7 to more than 100 days. Pain was severe, burning, and radicular, and located both in dermatomes different from, as well as in, the area of eventual rash. Two patients ultimately developed disseminated zoster with neurologic complications, one of zoster paresis, and the other, a fatal zoster encephalitis; both had been taking long-term, low-dose steroids. A third case of preherpetic neuralgia developed in a patient with prior metastatic carcinoma, and another case in a patient with an earlier episode of brachial neuritis. The final two cases of preherpetic neuralgia developed in individuals with no underlying disease. An extended period of pain before the onset of zoster rash has gone largely unrecognized. 
Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with myocardial dysfunction and acute leukemia. The role of amsacrine in inducing remission in patients with cardiac disease and acute leukemia was evaluated. There were 17 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and one with biphenotypic leukemia. In this series of 24 patients whose disease had relapsed and who had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, nine had a complete remission, seven with AML and two with ALL. In addition, four of six with newly diagnosed acute leukemia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction also responded. Among nine patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy, none had morphologic changes of sufficient degree to account for drug-induced heart failure. Patients with preexisting arrhythmias received amsacrine without incident if their serum potassium level was higher than 4.0 mEq/l at the time of drug administration. Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with acute leukemia and cardiac disease. 
Pagetoid carcinomatous involvement of the penile urethra in association with high-grade transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. We present a case of pagetoid carcinomatous involvement of the penile urethra and periurethral glands following cystoprostatectomy for high-grade transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Previously reported cases with involvement of the urethra are reviewed. This condition is believed to be a rare variant of transitional cell carcinoma in situ. 
Mechanisms of failure of mitral valve repair: an echocardiographic study. Surgical valve repair for mitral regurgitation has significant advantages over valve replacement, but little is known about the mechanisms of its failure. This echocardiographic study examined abnormalities leading to failed mitral valve repair in two populations: "immediate failure" of the valve repair in the operating room requiring a second run of cardiopulmonary bypass and "late failure" of valve repair necessitating reoperation on another occasion. Intraoperative echocardiography (IOE) after cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in 309 patients undergoing valve repair for mitral regurgitation over a 3-year period. Twenty-six (8%) of these patients had immediate failure of the repair demonstrated by IOE, requiring further repair or replacement during the same thoracotomy. The causes of immediate failure were left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (10 patients), incomplete correction (10 patients), and suture dehiscence (six patients). Echocardiography was performed on 17 patients requiring reoperation for recurrent mitral regurgitation who had undergone previous primary valve repair. These late failures resulted from progressive degenerative leaflet or chordal disease (n = 9) or suture dehiscence of the annular ring or the leaflet resection site (n = 6). In only two patients early in the series did the problem originate from inadequate initial surgery. IOE is an effective marker for unsuccessful mitral valve repair, and affords an understanding of the mechanism of the persistent dysfunction. Immediate failure of mitral repair may be reduced by greater attention to the mechanism of valve dysfunction and by changes in valvuloplasty technique to avoid outflow tract obstruction. Late failure after mitral repair occurs predominantly due to progression of disease, particularly in patients with severe myxomatous or annular abnormalities that are prone to progress. 
Localized Aspergillus infestation in primary lung carcinoma. Clinical and pathological contrasts with post-tuberculous intracavitary aspergilloma. Saprophytic infestation with Aspergillus was observed in pathologic specimens of primary squamous cell lung carcinoma. In one case, the fungus grew in cystic scarred parenchyma and bronchi distal to an obstructing carcinoma of a segment bronchus. In the other, fungi colonized the inner surface of a peripheral cavitary carcinoma. Neither patient had roentgenographic evidence of aspergilloma and neither experienced severe pulmonary hemorrhage or other complications attributable to the presence of fungus. Although both specimens showed colonizing growth within the abnormal air spaces, in neither had the colonies detached to form a separate intracavitary fungus ball. These patients, and eight patients with similar lesions reported in the literature, demonstrate that Aspergillus colonization of a lung neoplasm frequently lacks one or both of the features characteristic of post-inflammatory intracavitary aspergilloma, a loose fungus ball and antifungal serum antibodies. No patient, to date, has developed massive hemorrhage as a complication of this lesion. 
Scopolamine patch reduces postoperative emesis in paediatric patients following strabismus surgery. Scopolamine patch was evaluated for the prevention of postoperative emesis in 50 children undergoing strabismus surgery. All subjects were premedicated, with none receiving narcotic premedicants. Anaesthesia included controlled ventilation with the use of muscle relaxants, atropine, and halothane. Before operation, the subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a treatment group received a scopolamine patch at a dose of either 0.75 mg or 0.375 mg, and a control group received no patch. Both the incidence and frequency of vomiting in the scopolamine-treated group were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than in the control group. 
Recurrence risk of a new dominant mutation in children of unaffected parents. Extensions to models originally described by Hartl for predicting the recurrence risk of new dominant mutations are developed in this paper. Additions to the models are (1) possible somatic mosaicism in a parent in some families, (2) the possibility that the parental origin of the mutation may or may not be known, and (3) mutation rates which change as a function of sex and/or time. The models indicate that recurrence risks are most critically affected by (a) the amount of somatic mosaicism which can be tolerated in the parent without manifesting disease and (b) knowledge of the parental origin of the mutation. In addition, there is a moderate effect on recurrence risks if mutation rates increase in the father as a function of time. Recurrence risks are at least as large as the risk of trisomy 21 in a child of a mother of age 35 years or older, probably much higher (5%-10%) when the mutation is known to be of maternal origin or if substantial somatic mosaicism in the parent is compatible with a normal phenotype. The recurrence risk of a new mutation is high because of a very high ascertainment bias of families with substantial germ-line mosaicism. 
Smoking-attributable cancer mortality in 1991: is lung cancer now the leading cause of death among smokers in the United States? Findings from the new American Cancer Society prospective study of 1.2 million men and women indicate that mortality risks among smokers have increased substantially for most of the eight major cancer sites causally associated with cigarette smoking. Lung cancer risk for male smokers doubled, while the risk for females increased more than fourfold. On the basis of the new American Cancer Society relative risks, we project that cigarette smoking alone will contribute to slightly more than 157,000 of the 514,000 total cancer deaths expected to occur in the United States in 1991. Overall, smoking directly contributes to 21.5% of all cancer deaths in women but 45% of all cancer deaths in men. It would also appear that lung cancer has now displaced coronary heart disease as the single leading cause of excess mortality among smokers in the United States. 
Extracorporeal lithotripsy. An important adjunct in the nonoperative management of retained or recurrent bile duct stones. Retained or recurrent bile duct stones can be successfully removed in up to 80% to 85% of patients with the use of percutaneous or endoscopic techniques. However, problems related to difficult biliary access, large stones, and biliary strictures may decrease the success rate of this approach. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in 16 patients with complicated biliary stones treated prospectively over a 24-month period. Successful stone fragmentation was achieved in 15 patients (94%) using a Dornier HM3 lithotripter (average of 2290 shocks at 22 kV). Three patients (19%) required a second ESWL treatment. Biliary clearance of stone fragments was spontaneous in seven (43%) of the patients and required additional treatment in eight (57%) of the patients. Complications from ESWL were minor and included transient hematuria and ecchymoses at the skin entry site. Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy failed in one patient (6%) with a biliary stricture and surgery was required. At hospital discharge, all patients were asymptomatic and stone free. Treatment with ESWL appears to be a safe and effective adjunct for selected patients with complex biliary stone disease. 
Purtscher's-like retinopathy after childbirth. Severe bilateral visual loss attributable to multiple retinal arteriolar occlusions occurred in four young women within 24 hours after childbirth. In two patients, labor was complicated by preeclampsia requiring cesarean section. One patient was suffering from pancreatitis. None had connective tissue disease or antecedent trauma. Ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography revealed evidence of multiple superficial peripapillary and macular patches of ischemic retinal whitening simulating Purtscher's retinopathy. By 8 weeks, the white patches were resolving in all eyes and visual acuity had significantly improved in three of the four patients. The pathogenesis of this disorder is unknown but may involve arteriolar obstruction by complement-induced leukoemboli formed during parturition. 
Seronegative symmetric polyarthritis in Sezary syndrome. We describe a patient with Sezary syndrome and seronegative symmetric polyarthritis. Detailed analysis of the synovial membrane, including T lymphocyte subset delineation, demonstrated that malignant synovial infiltration was the direct cause of arthritis in this patient. 
Cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity in bone marrow transplantation: a prospective evaluation of new dosing regimens. Cyclophosphamide (CY) cardiotoxicity may be a lethal complication of bone marrow transplantation. Previous echocardiographic studies have reported that left ventricular dysfunction due to CY occurs in over 50% of patients undergoing transplantation. To evaluate the cardiotoxicity of new dosing protocols that included twice-daily rather than once-daily CY, 44 bone marrow transplantation patients were prospectively evaluated with serial ECGs and echocardiograms. Twenty-six patients received a once-daily lower-dose protocol (mean total 87 +/- 11 mg/kg), and 18 patients received a twice-daily higher-dose (mean total 174 +/- 34 mg/kg) CY regimen. In the higher-dose CY group, significant reductions in summed ECG voltage (-20%) (P less than .01) and increases in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) (+10%) (P less than .05) were detected in the first week following therapy. These changes resolved by the third week following CY and were significantly greater than the changes noted in the lower-dose group. However, left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) did not change significantly in either group. Five patients developed clinical cardiotoxicity (four, pericarditis; one, congestive heart failure); four of the five patients were in the higher-dose group (P = .14). Only a prior history of congestive heart failure or a baseline EF less than 50% was an independent correlate of clinical cardiotoxicity (P less than .05). Thus, dose-dependent cardiotoxicity following the use of CY for bone marrow transplantation is evident as reversible decreases in ECG voltage and increases in left ventricular mass, possibly reflecting myocardial edema or hemorrhage. However, systolic dysfunction is much less common with these new twice-daily dosing regimens when compared with earlier studies of high-dose once-daily CY. 
Engraftment after infusion of CD34+ marrow cells in patients with breast cancer or neuroblastoma. The CD34 antigen is expressed by 1% to 4% of human and baboon marrow cells, including virtually all hematopoietic progenitors detectable by in vitro assays. Previous work from our laboratory has shown that CD34+ marrow cells can engraft lethally irradiated baboons. Because the CD34 antigen has not been detected on most solid tumors, positive selection of CD34+ cells may be used to provide marrow cells capable of engraftment, but depleted of tumor cells. In seven patients with stage IV breast cancer and two patients with stage IV neuroblastoma, 2.5 to 17.5 x 10(9) marrow cells were separated by immunoadsorption with the anti-CD34 antibody 12-8 and 50 to 260 x 10(6) positively selected cells were recovered that were 64 +/- 16% (range 35% to 92%) CD34+. The patients received 1.0 to 5.2 x 10(6) CD34-enriched cells/kg after marrow ablative therapy. Six patients engrafted, achieving granulocyte counts of greater than 500/mm3 at 34 +/- 10 (range 21 to 47) days and platelets counts of greater than 20,000/mm3 at 46 +/- 14 (range 28 to 66) days posttransplant. Five of these patients showed durable engraftment until the time of death 82 to 386 days posttransplant. One patient failed to sustain engraftment associated with metastatic marrow disease. Three patients died at days 14, 14, and 17 posttransplant, two of whom had evidence of early engraftment. These studies suggest that CD34+ marrow cells are capable of reconstituting hematopoiesis in humans. 
Vasopressin levels in infants during the course of aseptic and bacterial meningitis. We measured urine vasopressin (VP) once daily on days 1 through 3 in 18 patients hospitalized with meningitis. Urine VP values were 215 +/- 100, 116 +/- 44, and 69 +/- 23 pg/mL on days 1 through 3, respectively, for children with bacterial meningitis and 34 +/- 14, 20 +/- 4, and 15 +/- 4 pg/mL for those with aseptic meningitis. Urinary VP levels of infants with bacterial meningitis were significantly greater than those of healthy ambulatory subjects (n = 18) on all three study days; VP values of infants with bacterial meningitis were also greater than those of infants with aseptic meningitis on study days 2 and 3. The VP levels for the subjects with aseptic meningitis were significantly greater than those of the controls on day 1 only. None of the infants exhibited the clinical syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. 
Femoral-distal bypass with in situ greater saphenous vein. Long-term results using the Mills valvulotome. During a 7-year period, 440 consecutive in situ saphenous vein grafts originating in the groin were performed in 371 patients, exposing the entire vein for valvulotomy with a modified Mills valvulotome. critical ischemia was the indication for bypass in 68%, and the distal anastomosis was to an infrapopliteal artery in 46%. Thirty-day operative mortality was 2.0%. Postoperative surveillance identified 18 stenotic grafts (4.1%), which were revised while still patent (primary revised patency); 36 grafts (8.2%) underwent revision after graft occlusion (secondary patency). Five-year life-table analysis showed overall primary revised patency of 78%, secondary patency of 83%, limb salvage of 88%, and patient survival of 66%. Femoroperoneal and inframalleolar bypasses fared well. The presence of diabetes did not diminish late graft patency. In contrast to reversed vein grafts, long infrapopliteal in situ grafts had long-term secondary patency similar to shorter femoropopliteal bypass grafts (p greater than 0.05). These results, coupled with the versatility and simplicity of the technique as used in the present series, suggest that in situ vein grafting is the procedure of choice for long infrapopliteal bypass. 
Disseminated malignant melanoma and recombinant interferon: analysis of seven consecutive phase II investigations. We have performed seven phase II trials with recombinant interferons (IFN) involving 191 patients with biopsy-proved, measurable disseminated malignant melanoma. The regimens and numbers of patients have included IFN-alpha 2A, 50 X 10(6) U/m2 subcutaneous (SQ) TIW (regimen A, 31 patients); IFN-alpha 2A, 12 X 10(6) U/m2 SQ TIW (regimen B, 30 patients); IFN-alpha 2A with cimetidine as an immunorestorative agent (regimen C, 35 patients); IFN-gamma (regimen E, 29 patients); IFN-alpha 2A with IFN gamma (Regimen E, 20 patients); IFN-alpha 2A with bis-chloroethylnitrosourea (BCNU) (regimen F, 30 patients); and IFN-alpha 2A with the biochemical modulator, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) (regimen G, 16 patients). The objective regression rates were as follows: A, 23%; B, 20%; C, 23%; D, 10%; E, 5%; F, 7%; G, 0%. Despite the higher response rate from regimen A, there appeared to be no survival advantage from any of these programs. The median time to progression was 1 month with a median survival time of 6 months. Most regressions involved soft tissue disease, were partial, and occurred within 2-3 months of treatment. Four patients received IFN for approximately 6 months and have manifested extraordinarily durable regressions of greater than 4+ years. The alpha-regimens produced a flu-type illness and anorexia which were dose-related. Leukopenia was most noteworthy with regimens containing gamma-interferon. Ongoing trials involving alternative and improved immune-related modalities are awaited with keen interest. 
Diffusion-weighted MR imaging of the brain: value of differentiating between extraaxial cysts and epidermoid tumors. This study demonstrates the use of diffusion-weighted MR imaging in improving the specificity of the diagnosis of extraaxial brain tumors. Three surgically proved lesions (one arachnoid cyst and two epidermoid tumors) and two nonsurgically proved lesions (arachnoid and ependymal cysts) were evaluated with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo studies followed by intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) MR imaging. The IVIM images of the lesions were displayed as an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) image obtained at 0.65 G/cm (maximum gradient b value = 100 sec/mm2) and compared with external oil and water phantoms. The ADC of arachnoid cysts was similar to stationary water whereas the ADC of epidermoid tumors was similar to brain parenchyma, indicating the solid nature and the slower diffusion rate of the epidermoid tumors. Cisternal CSF demonstrated uniformly high ADC, primarily because of bulk flow, which enhanced image contrast. Improved delineation of postsurgical changes was also possible. Our preliminary results show that diffusion-weighted MR imaging can be useful in distinguishing between arachnoid cysts and epidermoid tumors. 
The prophylactic use of cyclooxygenase inhibitors in recurrent herpes simplex infections. In an open study, continuous oral therapy with cyclooxygenase inhibitors (ibuprofen or indomethacin) reduced the incidence and frequency of recurrent eruptions in nine of 16 patients with herpes simplex virus infection. Retrospective analysis of seven cases indicated that natural killer cell enhancement assays might allow us to predict the clinical outcome of such treatment. 
Fusiform dilatations of the carotid artery following radical surgery of childhood craniopharyngiomas. Between 1982 and 1990, a series of 31 children with craniopharyngiomas underwent initial surgery at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with an attempt at total tumor removal. Nine (29%) of them were found to have fusiform dilatation of the supraclinoid carotid artery either at the time of surgery for recurrence (one patient) or on routine surveillance with enhanced computerized tomography 6 to 18 months postoperatively (eight patients). The finding of carotid enlargement was confirmed in seven cases with magnetic resonance angiography and in one case with a formal arteriogram. Eight of the nine patients remain alive at a mean of 3.7 years after diagnosis. None have experienced hemorrhage or other symptoms referrable to fusiform dilatation of the carotid artery, which is believed to result from surgical manipulation of the carotid artery. 
The effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on renal growth, function and arterial blood pressure in an animal model. The long-term effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) on children treated for renal calculi are unclear. To study the long-term bio-effects of this mode of treatment on the immature animal we evaluated 30 New Zealand white rabbits at 7 weeks of age for weight, serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, and arterial blood pressure after which they underwent left nephrectomy. Each group of 5 rabbits received ESWL of varying levels (500 to 3,000 shock waves) to the remaining right kidney using the Northgate SD3 lithotriptor (spark gap mediated). One control group received no shock waves. At maturity (16 weeks) the aforementioned parameters were measured again, and the kidneys and any grossly abnormal adjacent organs were examined. We found no significant change in total animal growth, renal growth, renal function or perirenal organs in the post-ESWL groups versus the control group. All post-ESWL groups had an increase in mean arterial blood pressure versus the control group with 3 of 6 groups showing significant increases (p less than 0.05). Histological renal changes, seen at all energy levels of ESWL delivered, included interstitial fibrosis, tubular atrophy, glomeruli destruction, capsular thickening, perivascular fibrosis and mild arteriole wall thickening. Changes were proportional to the number of shocks received. We conclude that ESWL delivered to immature animals does not significantly affect renal growth and function but it can cause significant permanent histological renal changes even at low doses and may result in an increase in adult mean arterial blood pressure. 
Adenoid cystic carcinoma: DNA as a prognostic indicator. A retrospective study was performed on 20 patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas of major salivary glands to see if DNA patterns correlated with their prognoses. Fourteen tumors were found to be DNA diploid; 6 were DNA aneuploid. Histologically, all DNA-aneuploid tumors had solid components, compared with only 5 of the DNA-diploid tumors. All of the DNA-aneuploid tumors recurred, in contrast to only 2 of the DNA-diploid tumors; the difference was highly significant (P less than 0.001). All of the patients with no recurrences had DNA-diploid tumors. In our study, DNA measurements of adenoid cystic carcinomas gave statistically significant information about prognosis and correlated to histological grading. We propose that evaluation of DNA content may be performed before planning the treatment of adenoid cystic carcinomas. 
Ventriculoatrial shunts for hydrocephalus and cardiac valvulopathy: an echocardiographic evaluation. A group of 20 patients with ventriculoatrial shunts placed as surgical treatment for hydrocephalus were evaluated for cardiac lesions, particularly of the tricuspid valve. Patients with histories of septic or thromboembolic events were excluded. In each patient a clinical history, complete physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest x-ray film and M-mode, two-dimensional and pulsed continuous wave and color-coded Doppler echocardiography were performed. Eight patients were found to have cardiac abnormalities including tricuspid valve insufficiency, tricuspid stenosis and insufficiency, and the catheter passing through the foramen ovale into the left atrium. These findings demonstrate that tricuspid valvular lesions are frequent in patients with ventriculoatrial shunts, and that periodic echocardiographic evaluation should be performed routinely. 
Computed tomography of cranial metastatic malignant melanoma: features, early detection and unusual cases. The cranial computed tomographic (CT) scans reported as showing metastatic disease in patients with malignant melanoma (MM) seen at the Westminster Hospital over a 5 year period were reviewed. Ninety-eight patients with intracranial metastatic MM were identified. Twelve had an initial scan which was reported as normal and particular attention was given to these to see if, in retrospect, any early features of metastatic disease were discernible. Fifty-eight cases showed the "typical" features of intracranial MM; the remainder were unusual in appearance, behavior, or site. Radiological regression was shown in only seven cases on follow-up scans; all but one of these patients had one or two large metastases. No significant lesion was thought to have been missed on a scan after the administration of intravenous contrast medium, but the lesions of three patients were difficult to discern on plain scans. Thus when MM metastasis is suspected, the use of the contrast-only scan is advocated. 
Thalamic atrophy following cerebral infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery. We investigated shrinkage of the ipsilateral thalamus following infarction in the territory of the middle cerebral artery in 33 patients who were admitted less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke and who were followed by computed tomography for greater than 1 year with no recurrences. The thalamic area was measured on the computed tomograms, and the ratio of the ipsilateral area to the contralateral area was calculated. All values were compared with values from the initial computed tomogram taken less than or equal to 2 days after the stroke. The values of the ratio on follow-up computed tomograms decreased gradually in 15 patients. In these cases, the area of the ipsilateral thalamus was significantly reduced after 1 year (p less than 0.01) and marked atrophy was observed. These results demonstrate the significance of remote changes over a long period of time after focal cerebral infarction. 
Efficacy and safety of prehospital rewarming techniques to treat accidental hypothermia. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of inhalation rewarming and peripheral rewarming for reducing the body core temperature afterdrop and accelerating rewarming rates. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized human experimentation. SETTING: Physiology laboratory with cooling during ice water immersion and rewarming in rescue sleeping bags in a windy, cold (2 C) air environment. Type of participants: Eight experimental subjects who were cooled to clinical hypothermia (35.0 C), rectal or esophageal temperature (Tr or Te). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Afterdrop was characterized as minimum Tr and Te plus recovery time to the Tr and Te levels at the onset of rewarming. Rewarming rates 30 and 60 minutes after maximum afterdrop for Tr and Te were measured. By analysis of variance, inhalation rewarming and peripheral rewarming evaluated separately or in combination did not significantly influence afterdrop duration, afterdrop recovery, or rewarming rates. CONCLUSION: With no physiological benefit and hazards identified (inhalation rewarming burning the face, peripheral rewarming eliminating carbon monoxide equal to 300 to 600 ppm), inhalation rewarming and peripheral rewarming are not recommended for the prehospital treatment of mild hypothermia. 
Reduction of infarct size by systemic amino acid supplementation during reperfusion. The amino acids aspartate and glutamate, in combination, were evaluated as a means of reducing infarct size and improving cardiac function during reperfusion in an intact pig having an acute anteroseptal infarct. Three groups of 6 pigs each were randomly studied in a blinded manner: control (no amino acids), aspartate/glutamate 3 mmol/L, and aspartate/glutamate 13 mmol/L. The left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded distal to its first diagonal branch for 60 minutes followed by reperfusion for 6 hours. Aspartate and glutamate were administered systemically immediately before reperfusion. The following parameters were measured: infarct size and percent area at risk, global metabolic function, global and regional myocardial function, and tissue parameters of metabolic function. The results clearly showed a significant decrease in infarct size from 60% of the area at risk in control pigs to 37% in both 3 mmol/L and 13 mmol/L amino acid groups. Cardiac output, coronary blood flow, and global oxygen consumption were not significantly affected by the use of amino acids relative to the control group. Global left ventricular mechanical function was also not adversely affected by the infarct and was not altered by amino acid administration. Regional function, however, was significantly decreased by occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery in all groups to near 20% and only significantly recovered to 64% in the 13 mmol/L amino acid group. Adenosine triphosphate and acetyl coenzyme A measurements documented significant increases in the 13 mmol/L amino acid group relative to the control group. The conclusions of this study strongly support aspartate/glutamate supplementation for stunned, reperfused myocardium. It is apparent that the effect of amino acid supplementation on glycolysis is directly translated into improved regional function and reduced infarct size. 
Can health education increase uptake of cervical smear testing among Asian women? OBJECTIVES--To determine the effects of three different methods of providing health education on the uptake of cervical smear testing among Asian women, and to evaluate the acceptability of different health education materials. DESIGN--Prospective cohort study over one year of effects of written materials by post, personal visit to give written materials, and personal visit to show a video on the uptake of smear testing. Techniques included a personally administered questionnaire. SETTING--Leicester, a city with a large Asian population. SUBJECTS--737 randomly selected Asian women aged 18 to 52 who were not recorded on the central cytology laboratory's computer as ever having had a cervical smear test. 159 declined to participate or were not contactable. INTERVENTIONS--Women were randomised into four groups: visited and shown a video (263), visited and shown a leaflet and fact sheet (219), posted a leaflet and fact sheet (131), not contacted at all (124). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Cervical smear test recorded on computer within four months after intervention. RESULTS--57 (37%, 26% of group) of the women visited and given leaflets and 80 (47%, 30% of group) shown the video attended for cervical smears. Only six (5%) of those who were not contacted and 14 (11%) of those sent leaflets had a smear test during the study. CONCLUSION--Health education interventions increased the uptake of cervical cytology among Asian women in Leicester who had never been tested. Personal visits were most effective irrespective of the health education materials used, but there was some evidence that home viewed videos may be particularly effective in one of the most hard to reach groups: Urdu speaking, Pakistani Moslems. Written translated materials sent by post were ineffective. 
Assessment of myocardial damage in dilated-phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by using indium-111-antimyosin Fab myocardial scintigraphy. For the detection of myocardial cell damage, an 111In-antimyosin Fab study was carried out on seven patients (Group A) in the dilated phase of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, seven patients (Group B) with dilated cardiomyopathy, and eight control patients (Group C). Imaging was done 48 hr after intravenous injection of 74 MBq of 111In-antimyosin Fab. Myocardial antimyosin uptake was visually graded as 0, +1, +2 or +3. A score of +2 or +3 was considered positive. The heart/lung ratio of antimyosin uptake (antimyosin index) also was determined. Antimyosin uptake was positive in seven (100%), nine (90%) and no (0%) patients in Groups A, B, and C, respectively. The antimyosin index in Groups A and B was 2.46 +/- 0.49 and 2.04 +/- 0.24, respectively, findings were significantly higher than that in Group C (1.51 +/- 0.13) (p less than 0.01). Positive biopsy findings were noted in only two patients in Group A. Thus, antimyosin uptake was increased in dilated phase hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and dilated cardiomyopathy, which suggests ongoing necrotic changes in these patients. 
Assessment of blood echogenicity as an alternative measure to erythrocyte sedimentation rate. OBJECTIVE--To determine the relation between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood echogenicity and whether measurement of erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be replaced by measurement of blood echogenicity in monitoring acute phase reactions. DESIGN--Simultaneous measurement of echogenicity of flowing blood and erythrocyte sedimentation rate in blood samples and comparison of results. SETTING--A radiological department in a university hospital. SUBJECTS--83 patients with a suspected venous thrombosis and 36 healthy volunteers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Correlations between the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, packed cell volume, and echogenicity of flowing blood. RESULTS--Blood echogenicity correlated poorly with the packed cell volume, but strongly correlated with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (when the packed cell volume was within reference limits) (correlation coefficient = 0.73). Blood samples with a greatly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate were highly echogenic. Only one of the 30 samples with an erythrocyte sedimentation rate below 10 mm in first hour had a higher echogenicity than the least echogenic sample of the 19 with a sedimentation rate above 30 mm in first hour. CONCLUSIONS--Echogenicity of flowing blood correlates with the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and its measurement may compete with conventional methods for evaluating the long term changes in acute phase reactions. Also, it has the added advantage that non-invasive in vivo measurements of blood echogenicity may become possible. 
Increased MR signal intensity due to cervical myelopathy. Analysis of 29 surgical cases. The cases of 29 patients with cervical myelopathy, who had been treated by anterior spine fusion, were reviewed. The relationship between pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images was investigated with special reference to increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on the T2-weighted images and the relevance of this finding to clinical conditions. Preoperatively, there were areas of increased signal intensity in 12 patients whereas there were no areas of increased signal intensity in the other 17. The lesions were not clearly demonstrated on T1-weighted images. The pre- and postoperative clinical condition of the patients whose preoperative MR images showed areas of increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on T2-weighted images was worse than that of the patients who did not have areas of increased signal intensity. Of the 12 patients with regions of increased signal intensity preoperatively, five showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively compared to the preoperative levels and seven had no change. The postoperative recovery of the five patients who showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively was better than that of the seven patients who exhibited no change. The areas of increased MR signal in the spinal cord might be due to edema, cord gliosis, demyelination, or microcavities. 
Chlamydia trachomatis in the fallopian tubes of women without laparoscopic evidence of salpingitis. 23 women with lower abdominal pain and Chlamydia trachomatis in the cervix, urethra, or both sites were studied. Laparoscopy was done with sampling of the endometrium and fallopian tubes for detection of C trachomatis. 11 women had laparoscopic evidence of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID); C trachomatis was detected in the upper genital tract of 8, but not in the upper tract of 5 who had laparoscopy again after treatment. The organism was also found in the upper genital tract of 9 of the 12 women without laparoscopic evidence of PID. Most of the women with abdominal pain or tenderness had tubal or endometrial C trachomatis infection, although only half had laparoscopic evidence of salpingitis. This finding suggests that antibiotic treatment should be given as soon as chlamydial infection is detected in the cervix and that pain does not necessarily point to C trachomatis in the upper genital tract. Laparoscopy may miss important pathogens in the upper genital tract, unless the procedure is complemented with detailed microbiological investigation. 
Left flank retroperitoneal exposure: a technical aid to complex aortic reconstruction. Over the last 5 years an extended left flank retroperitoneal approach was used in 85 of 531 (16%) aortic reconstructions deemed technically complex. Abdominal aortic aneurysm repair was performed in 70 patients (82%), bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease was performed in 11 (13%), and aortic endarterectomy for mesenteric and/or renovascular disease was performed in 4 (5%). Indications for use of this approach included a "hostile" abdomen (43 patients), juxta/suprarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (35), large (greater than 10 cm) abdominal aortic aneurysm (12), extreme obesity (10), associated renal and/or visceral artery stenosis requiring endarterectomy (9), inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (2), and horseshoe kidney (2). Suprarenal or supraceliac aortic clamping, averaging 31 minutes, was required in 43 patients (50%). Postoperative recovery was rapid (average length of stay, 10.2 days), and morbidity was minimal despite the complex nature of these reconstructions. The perioperative mortality rate in elective operations was 1.2%. This approach facilitated proximal abdominal aortic exposure and anastomosis, especially in large, pararenal aneurysms or in situations unfavorable to a transabdominal approach. Whereas a left flank retroperitoneal approach can be used in most aortic reconstructions, it seems especially suited to those that pose significant technical challenges. 
A randomized study of chemotherapy with procarbazine, vincristine, and lomustine with and without radiation therapy for astrocytoma grades 3 and/or 4. The authors undertook a controlled, prospective, randomized study of 171 patients with supratentorial astrocytoma grades 3 and/or 4 (classified according to Kernohan). All patients were given chemotherapy consisting of procarbazine, vincristine, and lomustine (CCNU) (PVC). Half of the patients received whole-brain irradiation (RT) to a dose of 5800 cGy in the tumor-bearing hemisphere and 5000 cGy in the contralateral hemisphere. After diagnosis of progressive tumor growth, patients received individual treatment. The endpoint of the study was time to progression, but cases were followed until the patients died. Median time to progression (MTP) for the whole randomized population was 21 weeks. Median survival time (MST) was 53 weeks; 18% of patients survived for 2 years or longer. Survival analysis showed that patients less than 50 years of age treated with PVC plus RT had significantly longer MTP (81 weeks) and MST (124 weeks) than all other patients. For patients less than 50 years of age treated with PVC alone, MTP was 21 weeks and MST was 66 weeks. For patients more than 50 years of age treated with PVC plus RT, MTP was 23 weeks and MST was 51 weeks; in the PVC group, MTP was 17 weeks and MST was 39 weeks. Age, Karnofsky index, areas of Grade 2, and absence of extensive necrosis in the tumor were significant prognostic factors in the univariate analyses. Patients less than 50 years of age treated with PVC plus RT had significantly longer survival (P = 0.037) when correcting for these factors in a multi-variate analysis. 
Adverse effect of therapeutic vasoconstrictors in experimental acute pancreatitis. Alpha-adrenergic drugs commonly are used to treat hypotension resulting from severe acute pancreatitis. It was shown previously that although systemic arterial pressure is increased by phenylephrine, pancreatic microcirculatory perfusion is decreased. Because inadequate tissue perfusion may be critical in the progression of edematous pancreatitis to parenchymal necrosis, it was hypothesized that vasoconstrictors might be harmful in pancreatitis. Therefore the effect of phenylephrine on cerulein-induced mild pancreatitis were studied. Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 54) were randomly allocated to 6 experimental groups and subjected to the following infusion regimens: (1) cerulein (cae) + phenylephrine (phe), (2) cae + saline (NS), (3) NS + phe, (4) cae + phenoxybenzamine (pbz) + phe, (5) NS + pbz + phe, and (6) NS. Initial and terminal hematocrit, serum amylase activity, and blood ionized calcium concentration were determined. The animals were killed 9 hours after starting the infusion. Macroscopic and histologic changes were scored by a 'blinded' pathologist. Phenylephrine increased the severity of cerulein-induced pancreatitis as manifested by statistically significant adverse changes in serum amylase, hematocrit, ionized calcium, peripancreatitic soap formation, and acinar cell vacuolization. These changes were antagonized by alpha-adrenergic receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine. It is concluded that phenylephrine is deleterious in acute experimental pancreatitis, the first demonstration of such an effect by a pharmacologic vasoconstrictor, and suggested that microcirculatory changes may be important in the transition of mild to severe pancreatitis. Caution in the use of vasoconstrictor drugs in patients with acute pancreatitis is recommended. 
Doppler echocardiographic transmitral peak early velocity does not directly reflect hemodynamic changes in humans: importance of normalization to mitral stroke volume Doppler echocardiographic transmitral peak early velocity normalized to the time-velocity integral during diastole is equivalent to volumetric peak filling rate normalized to stroke volume. To compare the pathophysiologic validity of normalized and nonnormalized peak early flow velocity, pulsed Doppler echocardiography with simultaneous high fidelity left ventricular pressure measurements was performed in 52 patients with coronary artery disease. Left ventricular loading conditions were changed by intravenous administration of norepinephrine in 15 patients and synthetic atrial natriuretic polypeptide in 15 others. Norepinephrine increased nonnormalized and normalized peak early flow velocities in association with significantly elevated end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressures and decelerated the time constant of left ventricular isovolumetric pressure decline. Atrial natriuretic polypeptide did not change either nonnormalized or normalized peak early flow velocity, despite significant reductions in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressure and an accelerated time constant. Normalized peak early flow velocity showed the highest univariate correlation with long-term change in mitral valve opening pressure (n = 52, r = 0.67, p less than 0.0001). It provided a modest univariate correlation (n = 30, r = 0.74, p less than 0.0001) with immediate change in mitral valve opening pressure during norepinephrine infusion, whereas this correlation was lower (n = 30, r = 0.57, p less than 0.001) during polypeptide infusion. However, multivariate regression analysis relating normalized peak velocity with long- and short-term changes in end-diastolic, peak systolic and mitral valve opening pressures, time constant and constant of left ventricular chamber stiffness improved the correlation coefficients (r = 0.80 to 0.85, all p less than 0.0001). In contrast, neither univariate nor multivariate correlations of nonnormalized velocity with long- and short-term changes in these hemodynamic variables were satisfactory. Thus, nonnormalized peak early flow velocity does not directly reflect underlying hemodynamic changes in humans. Normalization to mitral stroke volume clarifies the dependence of peak early flow velocity on the determinants of early diastolic filling. When left ventricular early diastolic filling is evaluated by Doppler echocardiography, normalized peak early flow velocity should be taken into consideration. 
Incidence of cerebral hemorrhage after treatment with tissue plasminogen activator or streptokinase following embolic stroke in rabbits [corrected] [published erratum appears in Stroke 1991 Feb;22(2):285] We studied thrombolysis in an animal model of embolic stroke to determine the safety of tissue plasminogen activator and streptokinase. We occluded the middle cerebral arteries of 137 rabbits with radiolabeled blood clots and administered tissue plasminogen activator (n = 49), streptokinase (n = 40), or saline (n = 48) at various times after embolization. We assessed the rate of thrombolysis and cerebral hemorrhage 24 hours later. Both drugs were very effective in producing thrombolysis. Compared with saline, streptokinase caused a significant increase in the rate of cerebral hemorrhage (p less than 0.05), but tissue plasminogen activator did not. We conclude that thrombolytic therapy for acute stroke should be safer with tissue plasminogen activator than with streptokinase. 
Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study. Final results BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of rheumatic valvular disease is associated with a fivefold to sevenfold increased risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study, a multicenter, randomized trial, compared 325 mg/day aspirin (double-blind) or warfarin with placebo for prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events), and included 1,330 inpatients and outpatients with constant or intermittent atrial fibrillation. During a mean follow-up of 1.3 years, the rate of primary events in patients assigned to placebo was 6.3% per year and was reduced by 42% in those assigned to aspirin (3.6% per year; p = 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 9-63%). In the subgroup of warfarin-eligible patients (most less than 76 years old), warfarin dose-adjusted to prolong prothrombin time to 1.3-fold to 1.8-fold that of control reduced the risk of primary events by 67% (warfarin versus placebo, 2.3% versus 7.4% per year; p = 0.01; 95% confidence interval, 27-85%). Primary events or death were reduced 58% (p = 0.01) by warfarin and 32% (p = 0.02) by aspirin. The risk of significant bleeding was 1.5%, 1.4%, and 1.6% per year in patients assigned to warfarin, aspirin, and placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Aspirin and warfarin are both effective in reducing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Because warfarin-eligible patients composed a subset of all aspirin-eligible patients, the magnitude of reduction in events by warfarin versus aspirin cannot be compared. Too few events occurred in warfarin-eligible patients to directly assess the relative benefit of aspirin compared with warfarin, and the trial is continuing to address this issue. Patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation who can safely take either aspirin or warfarin should receive prophylactic antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke. 
Comparison of disease severity scoring systems in septic shock. OBJECTIVE: To compare six disease severity scoring systems as predictors of mortality in septic shock when used in the first 24 hrs of diagnosis. The six scoring systems tested were: Multiorgan Failure; the Acute Organ System Failure; the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II); the Multisystem Organ Failure scoring system; the Mortality Prediction Model; and the grading of sepsis. DESIGN: Retrospective, case series, consecutive sample. SETTING: Adult ICUs of three teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: Seventy-one patients from 12 to 84 yrs, fulfilling specific criteria for the diagnosis of septic shock, who were admitted to the ICU during 15 consecutive months. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Multiorgan Failure scoring system, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II), and Acute Organ System Failure scoring system were found, with our modifications, to be statistically significant predictors of mortality. Predictive data for these three scoring systems were as follows: Multiorgan Failure scoring system p = .008, mean number of points of survivors 5.2 +/- 1.5 (SD), mean number of points of nonsurvivors 6.3 +/- 1.5; APACHE II p = .013, mean number of points of survivors 21.1 +/- 5.9, mean number of points of nonsurvivors 24.6 +/- 6.0; and Acute Organ System Failure scoring system p = .011. None of the other three scoring systems showed significant predictive ability: Multisystem Organ Failure scoring system p = .072, Mortality Prediction Model p = 0.091, and the grading of sepsis p = .27. There was a significant (p = .004) difference in the survival rate of the three hospitals. CONCLUSION: The Multiorgan Failure scoring system, APACHE II, and the Acute Organ System Failure scoring system, with minor modifications, were found to be useful prognostic tools for patients with septic shock and allowed us to compare the performance and treatment programs of different ICUs. 
Trebling of the incidence of testicular cancer in victoria, Australia (1950-1985). Changes in the incidence of testicular cancer in Victoria, Australia were studied from 1950 to 1985. Cases from the period 1950 to 1978 were derived from many sources (1116 cases). Emphasis was placed on diagnostic reliability; 97% of cases were confirmed histologically, and of these, 86% were reviewed at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute. For the years 1982 to 1985, Victorian Cancer Registry data were used. The incidence rose by a factor of 2.9 from 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15 to 1.73) per 100,000 in 1950 to 1954 to 4.16 (95% CI, 3.73 to 4.59) per 100,000 in 1982 to 1985. Between 1950 to 1954 and 1965 to 1969, there was a sharp rise, followed by a plateau or dip, then a further rise. Among seminomas, the rates rose in most adult age groups, whereas among nonseminomas, the rise was concentrated in younger age groups. There was a significant trend to earlier age of occurrence among nonseminomas (P = 0.0004) but not among seminomas (P = 0.89). Cohort analysis revealed a trend toward increasing rates for both seminomas and nonseminomas, and confirmed the trend toward earlier age of onset for nonseminomas. Disproportionate increases were observed for the 1915 to 1924 cohort of seminomas and the 1930 to 1939 cohort of nonseminomas. Analysis of available data from other Australian states indicated comparable rising incidence in New South Wales, Tasmania, and Western Australia. 
Valvular heart disease. A correctable cause of congestive heart failure. Surgical repair of mitral, aortic, and tricuspid valves and balloon valvuloplasty for mitral stenosis are being done more and more often. These complex procedures require accurate and high-quality imaging techniques to guide the physician in decision making before surgery and in assessment of success during surgery. Dr Currie describes the use of echocardiography in diagnosis and management of patients with various forms of valvular heart disease. 
Thyroid diseases after treatment of Hodgkin's disease. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Thyroid disease, especially hypothyroidism, is common in patients with Hodgkin's disease who have been treated with irradiation. We reviewed the records of 1787 patients (740 women and 1047 men) with Hodgkin's disease who were treated with radiation therapy alone (810 patients), radiation and chemotherapy (920 patients), or chemotherapy alone (57 patients) at Stanford University between 1961 and 1989. Among these patients, 1533 were alive at the last follow-up, and 254 had died of causes other than Hodgkin's disease. (Four other patients were excluded from the analysis because they had undergone thyroidectomy before treatment for Hodgkin's disease. The thyroid was irradiated in 1677 patients. Follow-up averaged 9.9 years. RESULTS. A total of 573 patients had clinical or biochemical evidence of thyroid disease. Among the 1677 patients whose thyroid was irradiated, the actuarial risk of thyroid disease 20 years after treatment was 52 percent, and it was 67 percent at 26 years. Hypothyroidism was found in 513 patients. A total of 486 patients received thyroxine therapy for elevated serum thyrotropin concentrations and either low free thyroxine (208 patients) or normal free thyroxine values (278 patients); 27 had transient elevations of the serum thyrotropin level that were not treated. Graves' hyperthyroidism developed in 30 patients (2 of whom had not undergone thyroid irradiation), and ophthalmopathy developed in 17 of these patients. Ophthalmopathy developed in four other patients with Graves' disease during a period of hypothyroidism (n = 3) or euthyroidism (n = 1). The risk of Graves' disease was 7.2 to 20.4 times that for normal subjects. Silent thyroiditis with thyrotoxicosis developed in six patients. Forty-four patients were found to have single or multiple thyroid nodules, 26 of whom underwent thyroidectomy. Six of the 44 had papillary or follicular cancers. Among the patients who did not undergo operation, 12 had small functioning nodules, 4 had cysts, and 2 had multinodular goiters. The actuarial risk of thyroid cancer was 1.7 percent. The risk of thyroid cancer was 15.6 times the expected risk. CONCLUSIONS. High risks of thyroid disease persist more than 25 years after patients have received radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease, reinforcing the need for continued clinical and biochemical evaluation. Prolonged follow-up confirms an elevated risk of thyroid cancer and Graves' disease as well as hypothyroidism in these patients. 
Detection and characterization of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) associated T-cell neoplasms in an HTLV-I nonendemic region by polymerase chain reaction. Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) occurs endemically in southwestern Japan, the Caribbean, and West Africa, but occurs sporadically in most of the rest of the world. However, because ATLL and non-HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms share overlapping clinicopathologic features, the prevalence of ATLL in nonendemic regions is unknown. In this study, 75 T-cell neoplasms randomly procured from the metropolitan New York City area were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of integrated HTLV-I proviral sequences. HTLV-I genomic sequences were detected by PCR in 6 of the 75 cases (8%); this result was confirmed by Southern blot hybridization. The clinicopathologic features of the HTLV-I positive and HTLV-I negative T-cell neoplasms were then compared. Although the clinicopathologic features of patients from these two groups overlapped, some findings were more commonly associated with HTLV-I positive neoplasms. Five of the six patients with HTLV-I positive neoplasms were from HTLV-I endemic areas, five were black, five were women, and five were less than 45 years of age, while the majority of the patients with HTLV-I negative T-cell malignancies were elderly white men. The incidence of hypercalcemia and lytic bone lesions was significantly more common among patients with HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms (P less than .001 and P = .004, respectively). The immunophenotypes of the HTLV-I positive and negative tumors were similar; however, all HTLV-I positive neoplasms were CD7 negative (P less than .001). In summary, our findings: (1) demonstrate the special clinicopathologic and immunophenotypic features of HTLV-I positive T-cell neoplasms, (2) suggest that most of the rare cases of HTLV-I-associated T-cell neoplasms occurring in HTLV-I nonendemic areas are actually endemic cases; and (3) that PCR is a sensitive, clinically useful technique for identifying HTLV-I associated T-cell neoplasms. 
Progress of fibrinolysis during tumor necrosis factor infusions in humans. Concomitant increase in tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1, and fibrin(ogen) degradation products. Several investigators have reported that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can alter the production of plasminogen activator type-1 (PAI-1) and plasminogen activators (PAs) by endothelial cells in vitro. We have examined the in vivo effects of recombinant human TNF administration on fibrinolysis as assessed by parameters in plasma during a 24-hour period of continuous TNF infusion to 17 cancer patients with active disease. The plasma levels of PAI activity increased sevenfold after 3 and 24 hours of TNF infusion. This was the result of an increase of PAI-1 antigen; PAI-2 antigen was not detectable. Plasma concentrations of tissue-type PA (t-PA) antigen increased twofold to fivefold after 3 and 24 hours of TNF infusion, whereas urokinase-type PA antigen levels in plasma remained unaltered. After 3 hours of TNF infusion the plasma levels of alpha 2-antiplasmin were slightly decreased, 5% on average, suggesting that fibrinolysis continued. After 24 hours of TNF infusion a highly significant increase in fibrin- plus fibrinogen-degradation products, and separately of fibrin degradation products and fibrinogen degradation products, was found. This indicates that fibrinolysis persisted, at least partly, in the presence of high levels of PAI activity. Whereas PAI-1 production increased, t-PA production by human endothelial cells in vitro remains unaltered or even decreases on TNF addition. It has been shown previously that TNF infusion in our patients results in thrombin and fibrin generation. Therefore, it is possible that thrombin, not TNF, is the actual stimulus for t-PA production in our patients. We speculate that fibrin is formed during TNF infusions and that plasmin is generated by t-PA action immediately on the initial formation of (soluble) fibrin molecules. Such a process may explain the generation of degradation products of both fibrin and fibrinogen during infusion of TNF in patients. 
Gastric emptying in human disease states. The application of new radioisotope methods in external in vivo scanning has increased our knowledge of how disease and treatment can effect gastric emptying (GE). Solids leave the stomach more slowly than liquids, and conditions causing gastroparesis affect solids before liquids. Gastric mucosal abnormalities and their treatment can affect GE. Diseases of the gastric musculature, including the inflammatory and endocrine myopathies, muscular dystrophies, and infiltrative disorders, can result in significant gastroparesis. Acute and chronic neuropathy may both affect gastric emptying. The latter neuropathies are now the subject of intense investigation with new prokinetic drugs. Finally, abnormal GE may be a major clinical feature of certain severe psychiatric disorders. 
Adrenal atrophy at autopsy in two asthmatic children. In two children dying in status asthmaticus, adrenocortical atrophy was demonstrable at autopsy. Both children had been treated since infancy with pulsed steroidal inhalers, short courses of oral or parenteral steroids, and steroidal skin preparations (for associated eczema). Adrenocortical atrophy has not been described previously in this clinical context. The increasing administration of steroids to asthmatic children may lead to the production of overt--or more frequently, subclinical--atrophy of the adrenal cortices with important consequences to mortality and morbidity. 
Recurrent spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrhage from peliosis hepatis. Peliosis hepatis is a rare and highly lethal liver lesion in which numerous blood-filled cavities or cystic spaces are dispersed throughout the hepatic parenchyma. The cause is unknown, although the condition is associated with several disease states and medications. Patients may present with hemorrhage, liver failure, the hepatorenal syndrome, cholestasis, or portal hypertension. We treated a patient who survived two separate hemorrhages from peliosis hepatis. The surgical intervention used, hepatic dearterialization, has allowed this patient to remain asymptomatic for 5 years. 
Severe late postsplenectomy infection. In all, 1490 patients underwent splenectomy in Western Australia between 1971 and 1983, giving 7825 person years exposure. Thirty-three patients developed severe late postsplenectomy infection (septicaemia, meningitis or pneumococcal pneumonia requiring hospitalization) and three developed overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. The incidence and mortality rates of severe late postsplenectomy infection were 0.42 and 0.08 per 100 person years exposure respectively and for overwhelming postsplenectomy infection the incidence and mortality rates were 0.04 per 100 person years exposure. There were 628 splenectomies after trauma, giving 3922 person years exposure. Eight patients developed severe late postsplenectomy infection of whom one had overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. Following trauma, the incidence of severe late postsplenectomy infection was 0.21 per 100 person years exposure, with the incidence and mortality rates of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection being 0.03 per 100 person years exposure. Patients undergoing splenectomy have a 12.6-fold increased risk of developing late septicaemia compared with the general population. Splenectomy following trauma gives an 8.6-fold increased risk of late septicaemia. The majority of severe late postsplenectomy infections did not occur within the first 2 years and 42 per cent of severe late postsplenectomy infections occurred greater than 5 years after splenectomy. The low incidence of severe late postsplenectomy infection and overwhelming postsplenectomy infection makes statistical evaluation of the effectiveness of prophylactic antibiotics, vaccination and splenic repair most difficult. 
Cystic adrenal masses in the neonate associated with hemihypertrophy and the relation to the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We report 2 cases of unilateral, multilocular, cystic adrenal masses in neonates. Both patients demonstrated somatic hemihypertrophy, which is considered to have the same implications as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in terms of tumor risk. Pathological examination showed multiple, adrenal cysts without evidence of tumor or routine adrenal hemorrhage. This finding appears to represent a previously unreported association between the spectrum of hemihypertrophy/Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and benign cystic adrenal disease. 
FK 506 reverses acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in rats. Severe graft-versus-host disease was induced by transplantation of ACI rat bone marrow and spleen cells into irradiated Lewis rat recipients. Treatment with FK 506 or cyclosporine A (CsA) was started after clinical and histologic evidence of acute GVHD was present. A 14-day course of FK 506 at 1.0 mg/kg/day could rescue 100% of the animals suffering from GVHD. In contrast only one half of the animals treated with CsA at a high dose of 25 mg/kg/day recovered. After cessation of immunosuppressive therapy, FK 506-treated animals displayed a marked prolonged disease-free interval as compared to CsA-treated bone marrow recipients. Recurrence of the disease in these animals could be prevented when FK 506 treatment was continued after the induction period with a low maintenance dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day every other day. 
Local failure after definitive radiation or surgical therapy for carcinoma of the prostate and options for prevention and therapy. The incidence of local failure and its relation to distant failure following definitive therapy of carcinoma of the prostate is discussed. Local failure may arise from incomplete resection, tumor spillage, clones of radioresistant cells, development of new tumors in an organ left in situ, or inadequate treatment portals. The authors review the various measures used as prophylaxis or treatment of local failure in relation to clinical and pathologic stage. 
Oral soft tissues in hereditary epidermolysis bullosa. Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is associated with diverse oral manifestations, which can potentially involve both hard and soft tissues, depending on the specific EB subtype. This study determined the frequency and extent of oral soft tissue involvement in the inherited forms of EB. Examination of 216 affected persons revealed significant differences in the oral soft tissue involvement among the various types of EB. The frequency of oral involvement was greater in the dominant dystrophic (81.1%) and simplex (generalized, 58.6%; localized, 34.7%) types than previously reported. The marked frequency of oral blistering was similar in both major subtypes of junctional (Herlitz, 83.3%; non-Herlitz, 91.6%) and recessive dystrophic EB (generalized, 100%; localized, 92.3%). Obliteration of the oral vestibule, ankyloglossia, and microstomia were consistent findings in generalized recessive dystrophic EB. Oral milia were present in all major EB categories, most prevalently in the dystrophic forms, but were not seen in all the distinct EB subtypes. These findings indicate that although there are no pathognomonic intraoral soft tissue manifestations in the various forms of inherited EB, there are predictable patterns of involvement associated with specific subtypes of this disease. Understanding the oral involvement associated with EB may aid clinicians in the development of more advanced therapeutic approaches that are compatible with and directed at the unique characteristics of each EB subtype. 
Chronic cluster headache associated with a vertebral artery aneurysm. This is a report of a patient with chronic cluster headache-like pain of 12 years duration. Investigation revealed an aneurysm at the junction of the vertebral and posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and after removal the patient experienced resolution of his cluster headache. The headache and aneurysm were both right sided suggesting a possible relationship. 
Fatal rupture of the intracranial carotid artery during transluminal angioplasty for vasospasm induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage. Case report. The authors report the clinical course, radiographic findings, and gross and microscopic pathology of a patient with fatal rupture of the supraclinoid segment of the left internal carotid artery during transluminal angioplasty for subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm. The rupture most likely resulted from a small portion of aneurysm neck which remained unclipped, thereby leaving an area of structural weakness in the arterial wall at the site of clipping. The area of structural weakness predisposed the artery to rupture upon the addition of transmural pressure induced by balloon inflation during transluminal angioplasty. Caution is advised when performing transluminal angioplasty in the region of aneurysm clipping since the vessel lumen "recreated" during the clipping procedure may contain some residual and structurally incomplete aneurysm neck in the vessel wall. 
Postresection autopsy findings in patients with cancer of the main hepatic duct junction. Extensive resection of the bile ducts combined with hepatic resection is the procedure of choice for carcinoma of the main hepatic duct junction. Currently this procedure is done without great risk, and increasing long-term survival is now the issue. For this purpose, it is necessary to elucidate the biologic properties of the cancer to take reasonable measures. Autopsy findings of patients who died of recurrence may offer a reliable guide. Autopsy findings were studied in 14 patients: eight who had undergone curative resection and six who had received noncurative resection. Cancer recurred at the liver hilum with invasion into adjacent organs. Peritoneal dissemination and lymph node metastases were infrequent. These were common findings in both curative and noncurative resection groups. Cancer cells in the connective tissue of the hepatoduodenal ligament may play a major role in recurrence. 
Infectious crystalline keratopathy occurring in an eye subsequent to glaucoma filtering surgery with postoperative subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil. We present a case of infectious crystalline keratopathy occurring after 5-fluorouracil filtering surgery. The patient had discrete, branching, white crystalline lesions in the anterior corneal stroma. Cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, and gram-positive cocci were demonstrated in corneal tissue biopsy specimens. Toxic and immunosuppressive properties of 5-fluorouracil may have participated in the pathogenesis of the infectious crystalline keratitis. 
Noncardiac chest pain in patients with heart disease. This is a retrospective study of cardiac patients with noncardiac chest pain referred for evaluation of esophageal motility. Sixty-eight patients with heart disease were compared with 210 patients without heart disease according to findings from symptom questionnaires and a psychologic test (Brief Symptom Inventory). More than 70% of each group qualified for an anxiety or depressive diagnosis on the symptom questionnaire. These diagnoses were supported by significant elevations of scores on the anxiety and depression scales of the Brief Symptom Inventory. Male gender and a diagnosis of panic disorder occurred significantly more often in the patients with heart disease. "Stress" was cited as the cause of illness in about half the sample, but this led to less than satisfactory rates of psychiatric evaluation or pharmacotherapy. This is of particular concern for the cardiac patients because of the known adverse effect of anxiety and depression in those with heart disease. 
t(11;14) (q13;q32) in B-cell lymphomas (intermediately differentiated lymphocytic and follicular). A report of four cases. The association of recurrent chromosomal abnormalities with certain types of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) provides important clues to their classification and pathogenesis. The t(11;14), an uncommon abnormality, has been reported in a variety of B-cell lymphomas, including the intermediately differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma (IDLL). The authors report here the histologic, immunophenotypic, and cytogenetic findings in four additional patients with such translocation. They represent 8% of 51 patients with NHL studied by cytogenetics in a provincial hospital of Western mainland Japan. Three of the patients had IDLL and one a follicular lymphoma of large cell type. These findings strengthen the association between t(11;14) and IDLL. Furthermore, the occurrence of t(11;14) in a follicular lymphoma, as the sole abnormality, along with histogenetic considerations, suggests the possible existence of a rarer subset of follicular lymphoma, not associated with the t(14;18) and histogenetically related to IDLL. 
Bone scan as a stratification variable in advanced prostate cancer. The serial technetium 99 (99Tc) bone scans of 76 patients with Stage D-2 prostate cancers were reviewed. Sites of metastases in skeletal areas in decreasing order were vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, long bones, and skull. Patients with one or two involved skeletal areas had a significantly longer progression-free interval and survival time than patients with three or more bony areas of uptake. Bone scans might be used as a stratification variable in future prospective clinical trials of Stage D-2 prostate cancer. 
Radionuclide angiography in the management of asymptomatic aortic regurgitation. Left ventricular systolic function is an important determinant of long-term prognosis in patients with chronic aortic regurgitation. In patients undergoing aortic valve replacement, those with preoperative left ventricular dysfunction have a greater risk of postoperative congestive heart failure and death than do those in whom preoperative left ventricular systolic function is normal. However, patients with preoperative left ventricular dysfunction are not a homogeneous group but may be further stratified according to risk on the basis of the severity of symptoms, exercise intolerance, and temporal duration of left ventricular dysfunction. Therefore, asymptomatic patients with reproducible and definite evidence of impaired left ventricular function should undergo operation without waiting for the development of symptoms or more severe left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, among asymptomatic patients with normal systolic function, indexes of left ventricular function are also helpful, especially when measured serially, in predicting the development of symptoms and the need for valve replacement surgery over the course of the next 5 to 10 years. Noninvasive imaging techniques should play a major role in this evaluation, and radionuclide angiography is ideally suited for the quantitative evaluation of systolic function in the volume-overloaded left ventricle. Although the prognostic value of left ventricular ejection fraction at rest is well established, ejection fraction during exercise has little value once age and left ventricular function at rest are accounted for and is of minor importance in formulating patient management decisions. 
HBV-DNA-related hepatocellular carcinoma occurring in childhood. Report of three cases. In a series of 325 HBV chronically infected children observed over an 18-year period, three developed HCC. These three children were born in southern Italy, a region characterized by a high endemic HBV infection rate; each had been infected perinatally, developed an acute hepatitis, and became a chronic carrier. Two of the three with cirrhosis were HBsAg positive at the time their HCC was detected. The remaining case had seroconverted to HBsAb but HBV-DNA integration could be demonstrated in the absence of cirrhosis; moreover HBV antigens were not expressed in the tissue of this case. The interval between HBV infection and HCC appearance in these three cases ranged from six to 11 years. A similarity between these three Italian cases and the majority of HCC arising in chronically infected children in the Far East is noted. 
Mucinous pancreatic tumors: ERCP findings Mucin-producing tumors of the pancreas are rare and difficult to diagnose neoplasms. To further characterize the nature of these lesions, four such cases are described here in which the diagnosis was suspected at endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography by the presence of ampullary or intraductal mucus. In one patient, pancreatoscopy directly visualized the tumor. Ultrasound and computed tomography failed to suggest the presence of a neoplasm in the majority of these cases, but endoscopic ultrasound was performed in one and correctly identified the multi-cystic tumor. A high incidence of acute pancreatitis was seen in these cases and was felt to be secondary to intermittent ductal obstruction by mucus. The characteristic appearance of intra-ductal mucus provides an important clue to the presence of this type of pancreatic neoplasia. 
Appendicitis: prospective evaluation with high-resolution CT. Computed tomography (CT) was used to prospectively evaluate 100 patients with clinical indications for acute appendicitis. Examinations were performed with the terminal ileum and cecum filled with contrast material. Acute appendicitis was diagnosed when an abnormal appendix or inflammatory changes plus an appendicolith were detected. Failure to visualize an abnormal appendix or appendicolith in the presence of pericecal inflammatory changes was considered suspicious but nonspecific. CT results were correlated with surgical and pathologic results (74 patients) and other radiologic and clinical findings (26 patients). CT helped to diagnose appendicitis (64 patients) and nonspecific right lower quadrant inflammation (five patients) and to rule out appendicitis (31 patients). CT had a 98% sensitivity, an 83% specificity, and a 93% accuracy. In 17 of 31 patients without CT evidence of appendicitis, other conditions explaining their symptoms were detected. When the clinical diagnosis is in doubt, CT can be used successfully to evaluate patients with acute appendicitis. 
Combined portal vein and liver resection for carcinoma of the biliary tract. Twenty-nine patients with advanced carcinoma of the bile duct or gallbladder underwent combined portal vein and liver resection. Segmental excision of the portal vein was performed in 16 cases and wedge resection of the vessel wall in 13. The operative mortality rate was 17 per cent. The median survival for the 24 patients who left hospital was 19.8 months. Actuarial survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years for all 29 patients were 48 per cent, 29 per cent, and 6 per cent respectively, whereas the median survival for 46 patients with unresectable carcinoma was 3 months and the 1 and 3-year actuarial survival rates were 13 per cent and zero respectively. This difference in survival times between patients undergoing hepatectomy with portal vein resection and those with unresectable carcinoma were statistically significant (P less than 0.01). Combined portal vein and liver resection is recommended as a reasonable surgical approach in selected patients with advanced carcinoma of the biliary tract. 
The effect of nociceptive stimulation on the changes in hemodynamics and oxygen transport induced by hemorrhage in anesthetized pigs. The effects of somatic nociceptive afferent stimulation on aspects of cardiac function and oxygen transport were examined in a model of hemorrhage in anesthetized pigs. The brachial nerves were stimulated (BNS) alternately to obtain a rise in heart rate of 18% and in mean arterial pressure of 17%. This stimulation was started 75 minutes before the start of hemorrhage and maintained throughout and after the withdrawal of blood. The animals were bled at a rate of 0.75 ml/min.kg until a total of 30 ml/kg had been removed. At the end of hemorrhage the reductions in cardiac index (CI), stroke volume (SV), and left ventricular stroke work (LVSW) were greater in the BNS group compared with controls. The nociceptive stimulation also elicited greater reductions in oxygen delivery (DO2I) and oxygen consumption (VO2) and a greater rise in the arterial plasma lactate concentration. Thus it seems that nociceptive stimulation exacerbates the changes in systemic oxygen transport and cardiac function induced by hemorrhage. 
Collagen stability and collagenolytic activity in the normal and aneurysmal human abdominal aorta. Two issues were addressed in this study. The first was whether a bona fide collagenase exists within the wall of the aorta. The second was whether the activity of this putative collagenase is greater in aneurysmal tissue. No collagenase could be extracted from the wall of the aorta under nondenaturing conditions. However, hydroxyproline was liberated from tissue samples allowed to autolyze at neutral pH under reaction conditions favoring the activity of collagenase. Such an activity was probably enzymic as it occurred in a time- and temperature-dependent fashion and was suppressed by chelators. In normal and stenotic tissue, activity was increased by adding aminophenylmercuric acetate, an activator of latent collagenase. Examination of the blanks revealed that the collagen of aneurysmal aorta was more soluble than normal. Furthermore, its digestion kinetics differed in a way that suggested that aneurysmal aorta possessed a labile component that was absent from normal tissue. Although the activity of the putative aortic collagenase was higher than normal in the aneurysmal tissue, our assays do not distinguish between changes in the amount or activity of the enzyme and alterations in the collagen. 
Successful use of topical vitamin E solution in the treatment of nail changes in yellow nail syndrome. A double-blind controlled study was performed on a patient with long-standing yellow nail syndrome to investigate the potential beneficial role of topical vitamin E solution for the nail changes seen in this disorder. Three nails received active solution containing DL-alpha-tocopherol in dimethyl sulfoxide; three nails received dimethyl sulfoxide only; and the remainder were untreated. After 6 months of therapy, the three nails treated with active solution showed marked clinical improvement and a corresponding increase in nail growth rates. Dimethyl sulfoxide alone produced a small increase in nail growth rate and slight clinical improvement. Active solution was then applied to all of the nails for a further 6 months, resulting in clinical improvement and increased nail growth rates in the remaining nails. These beneficial effects require further study. 
CD4+ lymphocyte subsets in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis and non-inflammatory neurological diseases. We studied paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from 18 inactive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 10 with non-inflammatory neurological diseases. By means of a dual-colour cytofluorimetric micromethod we were able to count 1500 cells on average in each CSF sample. We found a significant reduction of CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RA+ cells in the CSF of MS patients. Similarly, CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RA+ CSF/PB ratios were lower compared with controls. The reduction of suppressor-inducer T-cells did not correlate with CD8+ cell levels in the CSF. The CD4+ subset ratio (CD4+CD45RA-/CD4+CD45RA+) was significantly increased in the CSF of MS patients. Our data suggest that the reduction of CD4+CD45RA+ cells in the PB is not due to a segregation of such cells in the CSF. Conversely, CSF changes reflect changes in the PB similar to these found for other T-cell subsets. 
A primate model of macular cyst. Perfluoropropane (C3F8) was injected into nine eyes of six cynomolgus monkeys. In all nine eyes, macular changes consistent with the development of a macular cyst were noted within 3 months after injection. On fluorescein angiography, there was no evidence of retinal vascular leakage associated with the macular cysts. Histopathologic evaluation of six eyes demonstrated microcystic changes throughout the perifoveal inner nuclear layer. These coalesced into larger cystic spaces in the outer plexiform layer of the central macula. These macular changes are previously unreported in patients or monkeys undergoing intravitreal injection of expansile gases. This model for macular cysts may be helpful in evaluating the pathogenesis and role of interventional strategies in patients with cystoid macular edema. 
Update: Salmonella enteritidis infections and shell eggs--United States, 1990. From January through October 1990, state health departments reported 49 outbreaks of Salmonella enteritidis (SE) in the United States to CDC. This report summarizes three SE outbreaks in 1990 that were associated with shell eggs. 
Symptomatic xanthogranuloma of choroid plexus with unilateral hydrocephalus. Case report. Xanthogranulomas involving the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles are generally asymptomatic lesions. The case is reported of a 50-year-old man in whom a xanthogranuloma of the choroid plexus had occluded the left trigone, causing unilateral hydrocephalus of the left temporal horn and neurological symptoms. A review of the literature shows that xanthogranulomas of the glomus of the lateral ventricles differ from the xanthomatous cystic lesions of the third ventricle, which are probably akin to colloid cysts. 
Orthotopic liver transplantation for incurable alveolar echinococcosis of the liver: report of 17 cases. Between 1986 and 1989, orthotopic liver transplantations were performed in our unit for 17 patients with incurable alveolar echinococcosis. Ten patients had hilar involvement (group I), and seven patients had posterior localization (five of them had chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome) (group II). The delay between diagnosis and the orthotopic liver transplantation was more than 48 mo in group Ia (six patients), less than 24 mo in group Ib (four patients) and less than 48 mo in group II. Previous operations were more common in group Ia than in group Ib and II. Five patients have died-four in group I and one in group II. The actuarial survival rate at 15 mo was 75%. Early reoperations were frequent (69%), mainly caused by rebleeding. Bacterial and fungal infections occurred only in group Ia (four cases) and group II (three cases). In eight patients (palliative group), residual foci of infected nonhepatic tissue occurred after surgery. The titer of specific antibodies decreased during the first 3 mo in all the patients but one. In patients with radical liver transplantation, the complete disappearance of specific antibodies occurred within 2 yr in four cases. In the remaining five patients, specific antibodies remained detectable, but no evidence of recurrence has been obtained up to now. In the palliative group, a peak of specific IgM occurred at 3 mo; an increase of specific IgG was observed later. The growth of residual parasitic foci was relatively slow, and all these patients remained asymptomatic with a mean follow-up of 19 mo. We conclude that orthotopic liver transplantation is feasible in incurable alveolar echinococcosis and could be proposed without delay to patients with parasitic Budd-Chiari syndrome or complicated secondary biliary cirrhosis. In the other cases, the best time to perform an orthotopic liver transplantation is more difficult to determine. Nevertheless, in the perspective of an orthotopic liver transplantation, the management of these patients has to change, and repetitive laparotomies for palliative surgical procedures have to be replaced by interventional radiology. 
Cavitary lesions close to heart valve rings. A necropsy study of 13 cases. Necropsy reports of 13 patients with 15 cavitary lesions situated close aortic or mitral valve rings were studied in patients who ranged in age from 1 month to 57 (mean 24.9) years; 10 patients were male. Infective endocarditis occurred in 7 patients, rheumatic heart disease in 4, congenital heart diseases in 4, previous valve replacement in 4, and syphilis in 1 patient. Diameters of the cavitary lesions ranged between 1.2 and 10.5 cm; the aortic valve ring was involved in 11 patients; cavitary thrombosis occurred in 2 cases; the orifice communicating the cardiac chamber with the cavitary lesions was situated above the aortic leaflet in 5 lesions, below the aortic leaflet in 4 lesions, and above and below the aortic leaflets in 3 lesions. The mitral valve ring was involved in 3 lesions. Thus, different etiologies may be involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions; positions of the lesion may vary in relation to the valve ring, and the lesions may be a morphological expression of the fragility of the fibrous skeleton of the heart. 
Foscarnet in the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection of the esophagus and colon in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Foscarnet, administered via a central line, was used for the treatment of 18 episodes of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophageal ulceration in 15 patients, and in the treatment of 27 episodes of CMV colitis in 22 patients. In 15 of the 18 episodes of the esophageal disease, there was complete loss of symptoms within 2 wk. Only three of the 15 patients responding to foscarnet therapy had a relapse of their esophageal disease. Two of these patients were successfully retreated with foscarnet. Of the 22 patients receiving foscarnet for CMV colitis, four died during foscarnet therapy. Of the 18 patients completing the course of treatment with foscarnet for first-episode CMV colitis, 11 remitted completely and six had a partial remission. All patients with partial remission had a second pathogen responsible for the continuation of their diarrhea. Only one patient completing a course of foscarnet failed to respond microscopically to treatment. Three patients experienced relapse of their CMV colitis, two of whom responded to further courses of foscarnet. Foscarnet is an effective therapy for CMV disease of the gastrointestinal tract, with rapid resolution of clinical symptoms, long-term remission of esophageal disease, and shorter disease-free periods for CMV colitis. 
Histologic characteristics of carotid artery plaque. Carotid plaque characteristics associated with the production of symptoms were identified with quantification of carotid plaque constituents in high-grade stenotic asymptomatic (n = 8) and symptomatic (n = 44) plaques. Asymptomatic plaques contained significantly more fibrous/collagen material (88%) than symptomatic plaques (66%) (p less than 0.05). Hemorrhage constituted 2% and 1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic plaques, respectively. The predominant nonfibrous material was a pink amorphous material mixed with cholesterol, which composed 7% of asymptomatic and 27% of symptomatic plaques (p less than 0.05). No relationship was found between plaque composition and the number of ipsilateral ischemic neurologic events, nor was there evidence of a healing process. B-mode ultrasound scanning had a sensitivity of 94% in identifying plaque with greater than 80% fibrous content. We believe that plaque composition may be a useful discriminating factor in selecting asymptomatic patients for carotid endarterectomy. 
Resolution of Cryptosporidium infection in an AIDS patient after improvement of nutritional and immune status with octreotide. An AIDS patient with severe large volume diarrhea and malnutrition due to cryptosporidial infection is presented. The patient, who was not receiving zidovudine, was treated with octreotide with resolution of diarrhea leading to improvement in nutritional status, immune functions, and subsequently, resolution of the Cryptosporidium infection. This case points out the need for adequate nutrition in AIDS patients and highlights the relationship of nutrition and the immune system. 
The value of plain radiography in establishing the diagnosis of gastric lesions. Appreciation for the diagnostic value of plain (noncontrast) radiography of the gastrointestinal tract appears to have diminished with the advent of more sophisticated imaging techniques. A case in which scrutiny of the gastric air pattern on plain abdominal films suggested the underlying presence of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome emphasizes the potential diagnostic value of plain radiography of the abdomen for gastric disorders. 
In vitro radiation resistance among cell lines established from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Twenty-five squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines from 20 patients with head and neck cancer were assessed for radiosensitivity in vitro using a 96-well plate assay. Four non-SCC lines were also tested. Radiation sensitivity of individual cell lines was compared using the area under the survival curve (AUC) as a measure of the mean inactivation dose. Tumor lines were tested with either a cobalt-60 (60Co) gamma-irradiator having a dose rate of 100 cGy/minute or with a 4-meV photon beam having a dose rate of 200 cGy/minute. The mean AUC of the 25 SCC cell lines was 188 +/- 7 (SEM) cGy (range, 100 to 250 cGy) whereas the four non-SCC lines had a mean AUC of 225 +/- 9 cGy. The SCC cell lines with mean inactivation dose values greater than 188 cGy were classified as relatively radioresistant whereas those with values less than 188 cGy were considered relatively radiosensitive. In seven cases SCC cell lines were derived from patients who had already received radiation therapy. In four of these cases the tumor cell lines were radioresistant (AUC, 210 to 250) but in the other three cases the tumor lines were radiosensitive (AUC, 160 to 180). Thus, failure of a tumor to respond to radiation did not always select for radioresistant cells. The mean of the AUC for cell lines from previously irradiated patients (197 +/- 11 cGy) did not differ significantly from that of the cell lines from patients who received no prior radiation therapy (182 +/- 9 cGy). However, among radiation-resistant lines those from the four previously irradiated patients were significantly more resistant (mean AUC = 235 +/- 9) than seven other radioresistant lines from nonirradiated patients (mean AUC, 208 +/- 4) (P = 0.0194). In four cases more than one cell line was derived from different tumor specimens in the same patient. In each of these cases the lines from the same patients were similar to one another in their degree of radioresistance. Based on these observations the authors conclude that the degree of in vitro radiation resistance is an inherent property of some squamous cell tumors. 
Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced rapid acquisition spin-echo MR imaging of the liver. Rapid acquisition spin-echo (RASE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows for coverage of the entire liver with highly T1-weighted SE images during a single 23-second breath-holding period. The RASE sequence was implemented in conjunction with rapid intravenous injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine to enable performance of dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging of the liver. Prospective evaluation of 24 patients with 62 liver lesions 1 cm or greater in diameter was performed. Images obtained with RASE were devoid of respiratory-related ghost artifacts or edge blurring. The dynamic contrast-enhanced RASE technique resulted in contrast-to-noise and contrast-to-artifact values and time efficiency measures significantly greater (P less than .05) than those obtained with use of conventional T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences, indicating a higher likelihood for lesion detectability. Lesion conspicuity was maximal during or immediately following bolus administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, with lesions often becoming obscured at delayed postcontrast imaging. 
Endothelin binding in brain of normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats. The endothelins (ETs) are a recently discovered family of peptides which appear to be involved in hemodynamic regulation; they have potent vasoconstrictor properties and dose-related effects on blood pressure when administered peripherally. Little is known about the role of ET in the brain. The purpose of this study was to characterize the binding properties of various ETs in the brain of normotensive (Wistar-Kyoto) and hypertensive (spontaneously hypertensive) rats. [125I]ET 1 was prepared using the enzymobead lactoperoxidase method and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Membrane fractions were prepared from homogenates of various brain regions. A differential distribution of ET binding was found among the 14 brain regions studied. The cerebellum, brainstem and area postrema/nucleus tractus solitarius had the highest binding, whereas the cortex, pituitary and septum had the least binding. Competition experiments performed with hypothalamus, brainstem and cerebellum demonstrated different Ki values for the ET studied. ET 2 had the highest affinity with a Ki of 4 x 10(-1) M, whereas the ET analog, Ala3,11-ET 1, had the lowest affinity with a Ki of 3 x 10(-10) M. Saturation experiments indicated a single class of high-affinity receptors in cerebellar (Kd = 2.5 x 10(-11) M, maximal binding Bmax = 1.25 x 10(-12) mol/mg) and hypothalamic membranes (Kd = 1.9 x 10(-11) M, Bmax = 0.93 x 10(-12) mol/mg). No differences in Kd or Bmax were detected between Wistar-Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats hypothalamic and cerebellar tissues. The results of this study suggest a role for ET in the brain, but revealed no differences between normotensive and hypertensive strains. 
Antihypertensive effects of an aromatase inhibitor in inbred salt-sensitive rats. Rats susceptible to the hypertensive effect of dietary salt (SS/Jr) have excess urinary 19-nordeoxycorticosterone compared with salt-resistant control rats (SR/Jr). 19-Nordeoxycorticosterone is a hypertensinogenic mineralocorticoid, but whether it contributes to the salt sensitivity of SS/Jr is unknown. This study sought to evaluate the contribution of 19-nordeoxycorticosterone to the salt sensitivity of SS/Jr by lowering its production with an aromatase inhibitor, 10-propargyl-androst-4-ene,3,17-dione (19-acetylenic-androstenedione, 19-AA). This aromatase inhibitor also preferentially inhibits nonaromatizing adrenal 19-hydroxylation, an essential step in the formation of 19-nordeoxycorticosterone. To test this hypothesis, inhibitor (120 mg) or vehicle pellets were implanted into male and female weanling SS/Jr at 42 days of age. A high salt diet (8% NaCl) was started and two additional pellets were implanted at 52 and 62 days of age. Systolic blood pressure was measured in all animals and urinary corticosteroids in males. Compared with vehicle, the inhibitor lowered blood pressure at 50 days of age (when it could first be measured) until 64 days of age in females and 71 days of age in males. Corticosterone and aldosterone levels were not different between 19-AA- and vehicle-treated SS/Jr. 19-Nordeoxycorticosterone levels, however, were mildly reduced with the inhibitor (0.05 less than p less than 0.10). After 28 days of high salt diet all 23 of the 19-AA-treated SS/Jr were alive, whereas almost one half of the control animals had died. These data demonstrate that 19-AA attenuates the hypertension in SS/Jr; this effect may be through reduction in 19-nordeoxycorticosterone production. 
Bouveret's syndrome: an unusual twist on the classic cause. Bouveret's syndrome is a duodenal obstruction caused by a gallstone, manifested mostly as a gastric outlet obstruction. We have reported an instance of Bouveret's syndrome caused by two separate stones, either of which could independently have caused the obstruction. It is imperative to be sure that the obstruction is relieved before terminating the operative procedure. 
Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients who were operated on the acute stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage was studied under strict criteria. The 138 patients were classified into three age groups: 59 years or younger (group A: 73 cases), 60 to 69 years (group B: 37 cases), and 70 years or older (group C: 28 cases). Severity of both the subarachnoid hemorrhages on computed tomography scan and the angiographic vasospasms was graded. The angiographic vasospasms were analyzed at the internal carotid artery, M1 segments of the middle cerebral artery, and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral. In all the relationships among the subarachnoid hemorrhage grades, the Hounsfield numbers, and the operative approaches to the angiographic vasospasm grade, there was a tendency for the angiographic vasospasm grades to be lower with increasing age in both the internal carotid artery and the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery. This tendency was more apparent in the larger vessels, that is, the internal carotid arteries. Close correlations of the angiographic vasospasm grades to the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and to low-density area on computed tomography scan were found in both the M1 and A2 territories in the three groups. However, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and low-density area on computed tomography scan. Regarding the surgical outcome, the older the patients, the higher were the mortality rates: 8% in group A, 11% in group B, and 25% in group C. 
Reduction by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor of fever and neutropenia induced by chemotherapy in patients with small-cell lung cancer. BACKGROUND. Neutropenia and infection are major dose-limiting side effects of chemotherapy. Previous studies have suggested that recombinant methionyl granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can reduce chemotherapy-related neutropenia in patients with cancer. We conducted a randomized clinical trial to test this hypothesis and the clinical implications. METHODS. Patients with small-cell lung cancer were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of recombinant methionyl G-CSF to study the incidence of infection as manifested by fever with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, less than 1.0 x 10(9) per liter, with a temperature greater than or equal to 38.2 degrees C) resulting from up to six cycles of chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or G-CSF, with treatment beginning on day 4 and continuing through day 17 of a 21-day cycle. RESULTS. The safety of the study treatment could be evaluated in 207 of the 211 patients assigned to either drug, and its efficacy in 199. At least one episode of fever with neutropenia occurred in 77 percent of the placebo group, as compared with 40 percent of the G-CSF group (P less than 0.001). Over all cycles of chemotherapy, the median duration of grade IV neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, less than 0.5 x 10(9) per liter) was six days with placebo as compared with one day with G-CSF. During cycles of blinded treatment, the number of days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, the number of days of hospitalization, and the incidence of confirmed infections were reduced by approximately 50 percent when G-CSF was given, as compared with placebo. Mild-to-moderate medullary bone pain occurred in 20 percent of the patients receiving G-CSF. CONCLUSIONS. The use of G-CSF as an adjunct to chemotherapy in patients with small-cell cancer of the lung was well tolerated and led to reductions in the incidence of fever with neutropenia and culture-confirmed infections; in the incidence, duration, and severity of grade IV neutropenia; and in the total number of days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics and days of hospitalization. 
Dimensions of pain-related cognitive coping: cross-validation of the factor structure of the Coping Strategy Questionnaire. Previous research has demonstrated a relationship between cognitive pain coping activity and adjustment in pain patients. The empirically derived dimensions of coping activity, as measured by scales from the Coping Strategy Questionnaire (CSQ), however, have varied across investigations. The purpose of this investigation was to determine both the content and number of dimensions of the CSQ and to explore the potential moderating influence that sociodemographic and patient history variables may have on the latent structure of the CSQ. A total of 620 patients from 5 different chronic pain patient samples were used to assess the generalizability of the dimensions across samples. Confirmatory factor analytic procedures identified a 3-factor solution in most of the samples that was robust across various demographic characteristics. Two factors appeared particularly robust: one reflected conscious use of cognitive coping strategies (with high loadings on ignoring pain and coping self-statements) and another reflected self-efficacy beliefs concerning pain (with high loadings on ability to control and decrease pain). A third factor, which was somewhat less stable, appeared to reflect avoidance of pain by attention to non-pain-related mental activity (with high loadings on diverting attention and praying and hoping). Scales reflecting catastrophizing cognitions and behavioral coping strategies did not consistently load on the above dimensions. Issues concerning the conceptualization and measurement of pain-related cognitive coping dimensions are discussed. 
Chronic treatment with tin normalizes blood pressure in spontaneously hypertensive rats. We have reported that short-term treatment of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats with stannous chloride (SnCl2), which selectively depletes renal cytochrome P450, restores blood pressure to normal in young but not in adult SHR, and is without effect on blood pressure of either young or adult WKY rats. We report in the present study that chronic treatment with SnCl2, begun at age 5 weeks, prevented the development of hypertension in SHR over a period of 15 weeks at which time they were killed. Suspension of SnCl2 treatment after 8 weeks (i.e., at age 13 weeks) did not result in return of blood pressure to hypertensive levels in SHR. Age-matched WKY rats were not affected by tin treatment. These findings provide additional evidence that administration of tin, which stimulates heme oxygenase, thereby producing depletion of cytochrome P450, restores blood pressure to normal levels in SHR. 
Effect of cardiac tamponade on atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations: influence of stretch and pressure. 1. In order to study the role of atrial pressure and atrial stretch on the release of atrial natriuretic peptide we have measured plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration, urine output and haemodynamic variables in eight patients during and 30 min after the relief of cardiac tamponade. This condition is characterized by high atrial pressure with little or no atrial stretch. 2. Relief of tamponade was associated with a rise in urine output (53 +/- 27.9 to 101 +/- 24.5 ml/h, mean +/- SEM; P = 0.09), systolic blood pressure (95 +/- 9.6 to 126 +/- 7.0 mmHg, P less than 0.0001), and plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration (369.5 +/- 70.9 to 490.3 +/- 94.7 pg/ml, P less than 0.05) despite a large fall in right atrial pressure (18.6 +/- 1.6 to 9.5 +/- 1.3 mmHg, P less than 0.001). 3. These results suggest, therefore, that an increase in atrial stretch, rather than in atrial pressure, stimulates the release of atrial natriuretic peptide. 
Gamma-interferon induction in patients with chronic progressive MS. Although gamma interferon (gamma-IFN) may be involved in the pathogenesis of exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (MS), whether it plays a role in chronic progressive MS is not known. To investigate this, we retrospectively analyzed serum samples from nine chronic progressive MS patients who were treated with monthly intravenous infusions of the interferon inducer polyinosinic acid polycytidylic acid polylysine in carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC). Using a bioassay we found that the mean peak total interferon level was 177 U/ml 12 hours after infusion, and using a radioimmunoassay we found that the mean peak gamma-IFN level was 15.9 U/ml 12 hours after infusion, so that gamma-IFN made up approximately 10% of the total. Greater gamma-IFN induction did not correlate with clinical worsening; induced gamma-IFN levels were not higher in two patients who worsened on treatment, and the highest levels were found in a patient who remained stable. Either chronic progressive MS is not sensitive to gamma-IFN or the effects of gamma-IFN are masked by other mediators induced by poly ICLC. 
Colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. A prospective trial of optimal antibiotic management. The ideal prophylactic antibiotic regimen has not been established for patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and endorectal ileoanal anastomosis, a prolonged operation frequently accompanied by abdominal and pelvic contamination and associated with an infection rate up to 20%. The aim of this study was to evaluate, in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion, the efficacy of a short perioperative course compared to an extended postoperative course of intravenous antibiotics (cefoxitin) in patients undergoing colectomy with ileoanal anastomosis. Forty patients with ulcerative colitis or familial polyposis coli received a mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation and a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous cefoxitin. Patients then were randomized to receive intravenous cefoxitin, 1 g every 6 hours, or placebo for 5 days. No differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal, pelvic, or wound infections. It is concluded that a standard three-dose perioperative course of intravenous antibiotics provides adequate prophylaxis in the prevention of infectious complications in patients undergoing colectomy, mucosal proctectomy, and ileoanal anastomosis. 
Variation in management based on type of choledochal cyst. The management of 23 patients treated for choledochal cysts at the Oregon Health Sciences University between 1969 and 1990 is reviewed. The median age was 27 years, with a range from 1 month to 90 years. Seventy-eight percent of patients presented with abdominal pain, and 35% were jaundiced. Three patients presented with cholangitis, two with cyst rupture, and one with recurrent pancreatitis. Nine patients had had previous biliary surgery. The diagnosis was made in all patients with ultrasound and/or cholangiography. Fifteen patients (65%) had type I cysts, 2 had a type II cyst, 5 (22%) had type III cysts, and 1 had a type IV cyst. Stones were present in four (17%) cysts, and all excised cysts were benign. Seventeen patients with type I and II choledochal cysts had complete cyst excision and choledochoenterostomy. Four of five patients with type III cysts had endoscopic cyst incision and drainage, while the fifth patient had transduodenal cyst excision and sphincteroplasty. The patient with a type IV cyst had extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy. There were no operative deaths. Two postoperative complications occurred: cholangitis and a prolonged ileus. All patients had resolution of their pain and jaundice. Two patients had late cholangitis. Cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy are the treatment of choice for types I and II choledochal cysts. Extrahepatic cyst excision and choledochojejunostomy may be adequate treatment for type IV cysts. Endoscopic incision and drainage is appropriate for selected patients with type III cysts. 
Natural history of acquired renal cystic disease in dialysis patients: a prospective longitudinal CT study. Patients with end-stage kidney disease, particularly those treated with dialysis, develop proliferative processes in their native kidneys that result in the formation of multiple acquired renal cysts, renal adenomas, and carcinomas. Data about these abnormalities have been acquired mainly from retrospective studies. We undertook a longitudinal prospective study in which the native kidneys of 30 dialysis patients were surveyed by serial CT during a 7-year period to study the natural history of acquired renal cystic disease and the frequency of associated complications. Acquired cysts were seen in 87% of patients at the end of the study compared with 57% at the study's onset, and a significant increase was seen in mean renal volume with time. Five patients (17%) developed large hemorrhagic renal cysts and four (13%) developed large perinephric hematomas. Renal cell carcinomas developed in two patients (7%) without renal symptoms. One carcinoma invaded the renal capsule, but did not cause metastases. The other carcinoma was widely metastatic. Our findings are consistent with those of earlier studies documenting an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma in dialysis patients as compared with the general population. However, our conclusions are limited because the study sample is small and no control population was studied. We conclude that acquired renal cystic disease in dialysis patients is a progressive disorder often associated with cyst hemorrhage. Dialysis patients may also have an increased prevalence of renal cell carcinoma. 
Mesenteric infarction secondary to tumor emboli from primary aortic sarcoma. Guidelines for diagnosis and management. Primary aortic tumors are rare, difficult to diagnose, and often fatal. This case and a review of the literature identified aortic tumors as a potential source of emboli leading to acute mesenteric insufficiency. The case showed the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in diagnosing and determining the extent and location of an aortic tumor. 
Corrosion of modular hip prostheses. Nine uncemented hip prostheses of modular design were revised because of late infection (2 cases), femoral stem loosening or fracture (2), loosening of threaded cups (3) and protrusion of bipolar cups (2). At surgery we found tissue discoloration and macroscopic corrosion in four of the nine prostheses, located at the head-neck junction. Histological examination in most cases showed extensive necrosis associated with metal particles, indicating metal toxicity. Metallographic examination of the prosthetic heads revealed structural imperfections and inhomogeneity of the metal. We suggest that the crevice between the head and neck is a potential site of corrosion in modular designs. 
Abdominal aortic aneurysm in chronic thoracic dissection. Report of two cases. Two cases of lower abdominal aortic aneurysm in association with chronic thoracic dissections are reported. These infra-renal aortic aneurysms, superimposed on an abdominal extension of the dissection, always require surgical treatment because of their well known tendency to enlarge and rupture. The authors report their experience and discuss the management of this complication in chronic dissections treated surgically. 
Hormonal inhibition of the endometrium for resectoscopic endometrial ablation. Attempts at inhibiting the thickness and vascularity of the endometrium in preparation for endometrial ablation by using different types of hormones have been reported. To evaluate the effects of two different progestins, danazol, and leuprolide acetate on the endometrium, compared with the features of early proliferative endometrium, histologic studies were done for at least five patients treated with each hormone who then underwent resectoscopic endometrial ablation for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding. Significant and at times dramatic differences among the treatment groups were found, with progestin-prepared endometrium being the least successful and leuprolide-prepared endometrium the most successful. In addition, the prolonged suppression provided for a period of time after the procedure by depot leuprolide is likely to help inhibit endometrial regeneration and provide even better long-term success of the procedure. 
Venogenic impotence following dermal graft repair for Peyronie's disease. Peyronie's plaque excision with dermal grafting generally offers good cosmetic results for patients who require surgical intervention for Peyronie's disease. However, postoperative impotence has been reported in 12 to 100% of such patients. The mechanism of impotence in this setting is not well defined. We present 3 men who had venogenic impotence after plaque excision and dermal grafting for Peyronie's disease. One patient has subsequently responded well to dorsal vein ligation, 1 has chosen an effective nonoperative method of management and 1 continues to consider the options. We report venous leak as an organic cause of impotence after plaque excision and dermal grafting for Peyronie's disease, and its successful management by dorsal vein ligation. The implications of these findings in the surgical management of Peyronie's disease are discussed. 
Retrobulbar bupivacaine irrigation for postoperative pain after scleral buckling surgery. A prospective study. The authors conducted a prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial to determine if retrobulbar irrigation with bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.75% (Marcaine) has an effect on postoperative pain after scleral buckling surgery. Fifty consecutive patients undergoing scleral buckling under general anesthesia were randomized to receive either bupivacaine or balanced salt solution as a retrobulbar irrigation at the end of their retinal detachment procedure. Of the 25 patients who received bupivacaine, only three (12%) required parenteral pain relief in the first 24 hours after surgery. This was statistically significant when compared with the 18 (72%) of 25 patients requiring parenteral pain relief in the placebo group (P less than 0.0001). In addition, when questioned about their perception of the degree of postoperative pain, patients in the control group rated their level of pain as significantly more severe than did patients in the bupivacaine group. The authors conclude that retrobulbar irrigation with bupivacaine is a safe and effective way to achieve postoperative pain relief after surgery for scleral buckling. 
A cellular mechanism for impaired posthypoxic relaxation in isolated cardiac myocytes. Altered myofilament relaxation kinetics at reoxygenation. Single, isolated rat ventricular myocytes were made hypoxic for 10 minutes and then reoxygenated. During hypoxia, there was a marked abbreviation of the mechanical twitch, without a decrease in its amplitude. Immediately after reoxygenation, both the time to peak shortening and the duration of relaxation were markedly prolonged, and they remained prolonged for 10-50 minutes. The alterations in contraction and relaxation were not associated with any change in the time course of either the transmembrane action potential or the cytosolic calcium transient, as recorded with the fluorescent probe indo 1. Intracellular pH, measured with a fluorescent probe (carboxyseminaphthorhodofluor), showed an acid shift during hypoxia and an alkaline rebound immediately after reoxygenation. The time courses of intracellular pH and contraction duration were not parallel during hypoxia or reoxygenation, and simulation of the alkaline pH shift by lowering PCO2 or superfusing NH4Cl (in the absence of exposure to hypoxia) did not quantitatively reproduce the prolongation of relaxation seen after reoxygenation. The prolongation of contraction after reoxygenation could be overridden by the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or the nonenzymatic phosphatase butanedione monoxime. We conclude that delayed relaxation after reoxygenation exists at the single cell level and is due to an alteration of the properties of the myofilaments. Intracellular pH is not the primary mediator of this alteration. We speculate that alteration of intracellular inorganic phosphate or covalent modification of the myofilaments might be involved. 
5-Fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cisplatin as treatment for adrenal cortical carcinoma. Fourteen patients with progressive metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma were treated with a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), doxorubicin, and cisplatin (FAP). All had a large tumor burden. Six patients had a hormone-producing tumor; mitotane treatment was given to five of them during chemotherapy for its possible antihormonal effects. Treatment could be evaluated in 13 patients. The overall response rate was 23% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5% to 54%). A complete remission, which lasted for 42 months, was achieved in one patient. Partial remissions, which lasted for 6 and 11 months, were achieved in two patients. Cardiotoxicity appeared in three patients, myelotoxicity in four, and nephrotoxicity in one. This confirms that this regimen is an active combination for the treatment of metastatic adrenal cortical carcinoma. 
Fact and fancy. What can we really tell from the placenta? Considerable interest in the clinical significance of placental abnormalities has been fueled by malpractice claims when perinatal outcome is less than optimal. The pathologist must be aware of those placental lesions that may contribute to perinatal morbidity and mortality. This article reviews the abnormalities of placentation, placental weight, maternal uteroplacental blood flow, villous histological makeup, fetoplacental blood flow, the umbilical cord, and the membranes, as well as the problems of multiple pregnancy. The important contribution of abnormal uteroplacental blood flow to adverse perinatal outcome is emphasized, as is the need to determine the extent of placental damage when evaluating the contribution thereto of particular placental abnormalities. 
Heterozygous protein C deficiency associated with multiple congenital hemangiomas--a case report. Congenital protein C deficiency is described as associated with recurrent thrombotic manifestations. The proband, a fourteen-year-old female, has a history of severe and frequent thrombotic disease, moreover, she presents congenital multiple hemangiomas. Family history was positive for protein C deficiency since the mother of the proposita is also affected and has manifested deep venous thrombophlebitis. Two additional relatives on the maternal side were not available for study but were reported to be symptomatic. None of the family members presented angiomatosis. This case report represents the first description of the association of protein C deficiency with multiple hemangiomas. 
Clinical overview of management of chronic ischemic heart disease. The outcome of patients with chronic coronary artery disease is dependent on many factors; the most important ones include the severity and extent of coronary artery disease, state of left ventricular function at rest, extent and severity of myocardial ischemia, and the total amount of left ventricular myocardium that is at risk. To use noninvasive tests optimally, the clinician first must define the information needed. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of the test(s) in providing the necessary information, the additive value of the result of a test to the information already available, and the best combination of tests in providing the desired information help determine the choice of various noninvasive tests in a particular clinical circumstance. 
Combined nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and rocking bed in chronic respiratory insufficiency. Nocturnal ventilatory support of a disabled person at home. The use of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation via nasal mask with a rocking bed provided the necessary ventilatory support for a person with quadriplegia living at home. This option was required to maintain an independent life-style of choice. The combination of techniques and the linkage of devices demonstrated an effective use of simple available technology for respiratory care at home and the adaptation of the respiratory prescription to the total needs of each person: medical, social, and financial. The further use of nasal mask ventilation in selected cases is encouraged by clinical research protocol. 
Metalloproteinases in degenerative aortic disease. 1. Atherosclerosis and aneurysm of the abdominal aorta are associated with thinning of the medial connective tissue. We have investigated the presence of the connective-tissue-degrading metalloproteinases in homogenates prepared from atherosclerotic, aneurysmal and control aortic media. 2. Gelatinase activity was much increased in homogenates from atherosclerotic and aneurysmal aorta [10.9 +/- 1.8 and 13.3 +/- 3.3 micrograms of gelatin hydrolysed h-1 (mg of protein)-1 respectively]. This gelatinase activity was highest at the luminal aspect of the aortic media, where the activity increased three- to five-fold after the destruction of alpha 2-macroglobulin. Zymograms demonstrated the principal gelatinase in atherosclerotic aorta to have a molecular mass of about 92 kDa, whereas in aneurysmal aorta there was a spectrum of gelatinase activity from 92 to 55 kDa. 3. Collagenase and stromelysin (proteoglycanase) could be detected by immunoblotting in homogenates of aneurysmal aorta, but rarely in atherosclerotic aorta and never in control aorta. Collagenase and stromelysin activities were low, but increased two- to three-fold after the destruction of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases. Collagenase and stromelysin activities were highest at the adventitial aspect of aneurysmal media. 4. The secretion of gelatinase by inflammatory cells at the intima of diseased aorta could have a pathological role in establishing atherosclerotic plaques and medial thinning. Secretion of collagenase, gelatinase and stromelysin from the adventitia could accelerate connective tissue degradation in the media of aneurysmal aorta. 
Variability of body weight and health outcomes in the Framingham population BACKGROUND. Fluctuation in body weight is a common phenomenon, due in part to the high prevalence of dieting. In this study we examined the associations between variability in body weight and health end points in subjects participating in the Framingham Heart Study, which involves follow-up examinations every two years after entry. METHODS. The degree of variability of body weight was expressed as the coefficient of variation of each subject's measured body-mass-index values at the first eight biennial examinations during the study and on their recalled weight at 25 years of age. Using the 32-year follow-up data, we analyzed total mortality, mortality from coronary heart disease, and morbidity due to coronary heart disease and cancer in relation to intraindividual variation in body weight, including only end points that occurred after the 10th biennial examination. We used age-adjusted proportional-hazards regression for the data analysis. RESULTS. Subjects with highly variable body weights had increased total mortality (P = 0.005 for men, P = 0.01 for women), mortality from coronary heart disease (P = 0.009 for men, P = 0.009 for women), and morbidity due to coronary heart disease (P = 0.0009 for men, P = 0.006 for women). Using a multivariate analysis that also controlled for obesity, trends in weight over time, and five indicators of cardiovascular risk, we found that the positive associations between fluctuations in body weight and end points related to mortality and coronary heart disease could not be attributed to these potential confounding factors. The relative risks of these end points in subjects whose weight varied substantially, as compared with those whose weight was relatively stable, ranged from 1.27 to 1.93. CONCLUSIONS. Fluctuations in body weight may have negative health consequences, independent of obesity and the trend of body weight over time. 
The serotonin syndrome. OBJECTIVE AND METHOD: A review of the literature on the serotonin syndrome in animals and human beings was conducted, and 12 reports of 38 cases in human patients were then analyzed to determine the most frequently reported clinical features and drug interactions, as well as the incidence, treatment, and outcome of this syndrome. FINDINGS: The serotonin syndrome is most commonly the result of the interaction between serotonergic agents and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. The most frequent clinical features are changes in mental status, restlessness, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, diaphoresis, shivering, and tremor. The presumed pathophysiological mechanism involves brainstem and spinal cord activation of the 1A form of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) receptor. The incidence of the syndrome is not known. Both sexes have been affected, and patients' ages have ranged from 20 to 68 years. Discontinuation of the suspected serotonergic agent and institution of supportive measures are the primary treatment, although 5-HT receptor antagonists may also play a role. Once treatment is instituted, the syndrome typically resolves within 24 hours, but confusion can last for days, and death has been reported. CONCLUSIONS: The serotonin syndrome is a toxic condition requiring heightened clinical awareness for prevention, recognition, and prompt treatment. Further work is needed to establish the diagnostic criteria, incidence, and predisposing factors, to identify the role of 5-HT antagonists in treatment, and to differentiate the syndrome from neuroleptic malignant syndrome. 
Thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute limb ischaemia. Acute limb ischaemia poses a threat to both the limb and life of a patient. Until recently, attempted revascularization by thromboembolectomy or vascular reconstruction held the best chance of limb salvage. Thrombolytic techniques afford an alternative method of management for this condition and are effective in selected patients. Low-dose intra-arterial streptokinase is the most established method of thrombolysis, although the recently developed tissue plasminogen activator offers a promising alternative. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is not an easy option, being labour intensive and requiring close co-operation between surgeon and radiologist. Thrombolytic and surgical techniques are not mutually exclusive but are best used to complement each other. Ideally patients with acute limb ischaemia should be managed by surgeons with knowledge of, and access to, optimal current surgical and non-surgical techniques. 
Health implications of obesity in American Indians and Alaska Natives. American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are experiencing an epidemic of diabetes, increasing rates of coronary artery disease and hypertension, and poor survival rates for breast cancer that are likely partially attributable to the increasing prevalence of obesity over the past generation. Obesity may also contribute to the high rates of gallstones and to adverse outcomes of pregnancy in AI/ANs. Although overall mortality was not associated with obesity in Pima Indians (except in the most obese men), the relationship of obesity to longevity in other AI/AN groups is not known. Further study of the specific health effects of obesity in various groups of AI/ANs are needed. In the meantime, community-based programs to prevent obesity and its sequelae should be implemented in all AI/AN communities. 
Treatment of primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome with ibuprofen and alprazolam. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study. A multidimensional evaluation of 78 patients with primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) revealed no significant relationship between clinical measures of physical discomfort and psychological measures. This observation provided evidence against the notion that the pain of PFS has a psychological etiology. The same patients were randomized into 4 groups for treatment with ibuprofen and/or alprazolam in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Clinical improvement in patient rating of disease severity and in the severity of tenderness upon palpation was most apparent in the subgroup of patients who were receiving both ibuprofen and alprazolam. An 8-week, open-label study in which 52 patients received both drugs further documented improvement in outcome measures. These data indicate that treatment with a combination of ibuprofen and alprazolam can be beneficial for some patients with PFS. 
Respiratory complications in critically ill medical patients with acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine types of respiratory complications encountered in critically ill patients with serious acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and to identify associated risk factors. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A university hospital medical ICU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed medical records of 86 patients admitted to the medical ICU over a 2 1/2-yr period of time, for 107 consecutive episodes of serious acute upper GI bleeding. Clinical features of patients who developed respiratory complications of pneumonia, witnessed aspiration of gastric contents, or who required intubation and mechanical ventilation for other reasons were compared with those features of patients without respiratory complications. MAIN RESULTS: Respiratory complications occurred during 23 (22%) serious upper GI bleeding episodes (mean transfusion requirement, 7 units of packed RBCs). Twelve patients developed pneumonia and all had evidence of advanced liver disease. Five patients were observed to aspirate gastric contents and six patients require intubation and mechanical ventilation for reasons other than pneumonia or aspiration. Esophageal sites of bleeding (esophagitis, esophageal ulcers and esophageal varices), advanced liver disease, age greater than 70 yrs, and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score greater than 13 appeared to be risk factors. Mortality rate was increased in patients with respiratory complications: 70% of patients with respiratory complications died, compared with 4% of those patients without such problems (p less than .001). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory complications are common in critically ill medical patients with serious acute upper GI bleeding, and are associated with a poor outcome. Risk factors include advanced liver disease, esophageal site of bleeding, age greater than 70 yrs, and higher APACHE II score. 
Aphthoid ulceration of the colon in strongyloidiasis. In humans, infestation with Strongyloides stercoralis most commonly involves the upper small intestine. We describe a 65-yr-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypoalbuminemia, and was found at colonoscopy to have patchy erythema with aphthoid ulcers scattered throughout the large intestine proximal to the splenic flexure. Biopsy of involved areas and examination of the colonic effluent revealed S. stercoralis larvae. Previous reports of colonic involvement with this nematode, and the differential diagnosis of aphthoid ulcers, a newly described lesion associated with S. stercoralis infestation, are discussed. 
Blood and bone marrow eosinophilia in malignant tumors. Role and nature of blood and tissue eosinophil colony-stimulating factor(s) in two patients. Eosinophilia of the blood and bone marrow may be encountered in patients with disseminated malignancies. It is unrelated to the histologic type of the tumor but usually reflects its aggressiveness and prognostic outlook. Its pathogenesis is controversial. The presence of eosinophil colony-stimulating factor(s) in serum and malignant tissue extracts was evaluated in two cases of malignancies accompanied by marked blood and bone marrow eosinophilia. When compared with controls, serum and tumor tissue extracts stimulated the growth of G, M, and Eo colonies in semisolid cultures of human bone marrow. Such stimulating effect was inhibited by the addition of antibodies to granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-3. Thus, the colony-stimulating factor(s) play a role in the pathogenesis of the eosinophilia associated with some malignant tumors, and these factors appear to include GM-CSF, interleukin-3, and probably others. 
Tubuloglomerular feedback in one-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats. Previous studies have shown that hydropenic one-kidney, one-clip (1-K, 1-C) hypertensive HT rats exhibit impaired autoregulation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in response to reduced arterial perfusion pressure. We investigated the possible role of altered tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) activity in this phenomenon. Uninephrectomized Wistar rats were studied acutely 3 weeks after placing silver clips (0.2 mm) on the renal artery. Experiments were performed in 1-K,1-C HT rats and in uninephrectomized control animals. TGF activity was assessed as changes in proximal tubule stop-flow pressure (SFP) in response to orthograde microperfusion from 0 to 80 nl/min into late proximal tubule segments. Only the highest perfusion rates (approximately 40 nl/min) into late proximal tubule segments resulted in maximal decreases in SFP, indicating a marked rightward shift of overall TGF activity in 1-K,1-C HT rats. Similar responses were observed in the uninephrectomized animals. In contrast, changes of SFP were observed at lower perfusion rates in normal animals and maximal responses were observed at perfusion rates of approximately 20 nl/min. These observations are consistent with the possibility that altered TGF activity contributes to impaired autoregulation of GFR in 1-K,1-C HT rats in response to reduced renal perfusion pressure. In response to treatment with i.v. captopril, the 1-K,1-C HT rats exhibited marked decreases in systemic arterial pressure associated with decreases in SFP and virtually complete inhibition of TGF activity. It is attractive to hypothesize that these alterations in TGF characteristics in the 1-K,1-C HT rats play a significant pathophysiologic role in the acute renal dysfunction observed in response to acute decreases of blood pressure during conditions of augmented angiotensin activity. Additional future studies will allow us to address the precise role for intrarenal angiotensin in these phenomena. 
Characterization of syngeneic rat monoclonal antibodies to the HSN tumor using syngeneic monoclonal anti-idiotopic antibodies. Twelve syngeneic anti-idiotopic mAb (anti-idiotypic/idiotopic antibodies Ab2)) were prepared from CBH/Cbi rats immunized with one of three monoclonal anti-HSN antibodies (Ab1) (11/160, ALN/11/53, or ALN/16/53) specific for the HSN tumor. The sera of the rats used for hybridoma production and all of the monoclonal Ab2 specifically inhibited the binding to HSN of the immunizing Ab1 only. It is concluded that, in this completely syngeneic system, only the private idiotopes associated with the antibody-combining site were immunogenic. Analyses using Western blotting showed that the Ab2 bound to intact Ab1 and to isolated H chains where the intra-strand disulfide bonds remained intact. The Ab2 did not bind to L chains or to fully reduced H chains of the Ab1. It is concluded that the idiotopes expressed on the H chain were conformational. When a panel of 13 monoclonal Ab1 (including the three used for immunization) were tested for reactivity with the Ab2, three reacted specifically with their respective Ab2 and 8 gave no binding suggesting that each Ab1 had a distinct idiotypic specificity despite the fact that all the Ab1 competed with each other for binding to Ag. However, the two remaining Ab1 (ALN/9/94 and ALN/12/17) generated from different tumor-bearing rats, were found to possess the same idiotypic specificity as 11/160. A detailed analysis using seven Ab2 raised against 11/160 showed that while the idiotype of ALN/9/94 and 11/160 were very similar, that of ALN/12/17 showed some clear differences. These three Ab1 have been shown previously to bind a sequential epitope on the HSN Ag in Western blots and it is postulated that the common idiotype of these Ab1 reflects their recognition of a sequential epitope. This may also account for the relatively frequent occurrence in tumor bearer sera of antibodies with this Id. 
Salmonella: a rare cause of subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis. A 36 year old woman had emergency pericardectomy because of subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis. The pericardial fluid and tissue culture showed that this was caused by infection with Salmonella enteritidis. Cardiac involvement with salmonella does not usually present in such an aggressive manner and it has not previously been reported to cause this rare type of cardiac constriction. 
Urinary retention--an unusual dystonic reaction to continuous metoclopramide infusion. Vomiting is one of the most distressing adverse effects of cancer chemotherapy. Metoclopramide by continuous infusion (400 micrograms/kg/h after a loading dose of 2.5 mg/kg) is a novel administration method for optimizing efficacy. A two-year-old boy developed urinary retention on three occasions, once accompanied by priapism and slurred speech, while receiving a continuous infusion. This was reversed by procyclidine, suggesting that it may have been a dystonic reaction. 
Complications of the variable screw plate pedicle screw fixation. In this study, 124 consecutive cases of posterior spinal fusion with variable screw plate fixation were reviewed. In 33 patients (27%), 41 complications were identified. Urinary tract infection without sequelae developed in 13 patients. Dural tear occurred in seven patients and wound hematoma in five. Wound infection developed in three patients; one was subfascial requiring instrument and graft removal. Neurologic deficit developed in seven patients (6%), in five of whom the deficit was due to manipulation and reduction of neural elements. Two of the seven deficits were believed to be caused by misplaced pedicle screws. Variable screw plate fixation is a formidable procedure with a significant complications rate. 
Antibody-fluorescein conjugates for photoimmunodiagnosis of human colon carcinoma in nude mice. To improve the detectability of tumors by light-induced fluorescence, the use of monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) as carriers of fluorescent molecules was studied. As a model for this approach, the biodistribution of an anticarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) MoAb coupled to fluorescein was studied in mice bearing a human colon carcinoma xenograft. In vitro, such conjugates with fluorescein-MoAb molar ratios ranging from four to 19, doubly labeled with 125I, showed more than 82% binding to immobilized CEA. In vivo, conjugates with a fluorescein-MoAb molar ratio of ten or less resulted in a tumor uptake of more than 30% of the injected dose of radioactivity per gram tumor at 24 hours. Tumor to liver, kidney, and muscle ratios of 20, 30 and 72, respectively, were obtained 48 hours after injection of the 125I-MoAb-(fluorescein)10 conjugate. The highest fluorescence intensity was always obtained for the tumor with the anti-CEA MoAb conjugate; whereas in control mice injected with fluoresceinated control immunoglobulin G1, no detectable increase in tumor fluorescence was observed. To compare these results with a classically used dye, mice bearing the same xenografts received 60 micrograms of Photofrin II. The intensity of the fluorescence signal of the tumor with this amount of Photofrin II was eight times lower than that obtained after an injection of 442 ng of fluorescein coupled with 20 micrograms of MoAb, which gave an absolute amount of fluorescein localized in the tumor of up to 125 ng/g of tumor. These results illustrate the possibility of improving the specificity of in vivo tumor localization of dyes for laser-induced fluorescence photodetection and phototherapy by coupling them to MoAb directed against tumor markers. 
Estimated prevalence of dementia among elderly black and white community residents. A stratified random sample of 83 black and 81 white community residents aged 65 years and older in a five-county area in the Piedmont region of North Carolina was evaluated for dementia, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke--Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria. Of 164 subjects, 26 were found to be demented, resulting in an estimated prevalence rate of dementia in the five-county area of 16% (95% confidence interval, 7.92 to 24.08) for blacks and 3.05% (95% confidence interval, 0 to 6.91) for whites. The estimated prevalence of dementia for white women (2.9%) was similar to that for white men (3.3%), but the rate for black women was distinctly higher than for black men (19.9% and 8.9%, respectively). Blacks were more likely than whites to have a history of stroke, hypertension, and other chronic disorders that might have contributed to the development of dementia. Apart from differences in rates of institutionalization, no other relevant factors were identified that might explain the difference in the prevalence of dementia in these black and white community residents. 
Extended aortic root replacement with cryopreserved allografts: do they hold up? The extended aortic root replacement technique is used for the surgical repair of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction complicated by concurrent hypoplastic aortic annulus, multiple levels of obstruction, or aortic insufficiency. Extended aortic root replacement incorporates the concepts of aortic root replacement and aortoventriculoplasty to create a comparatively simple procedure. Unique features of the technique include the implantation of an allograft, which makes the need for anticoagulation obsolete, and use of the donor mitral leaflet to enlarge the outflow tract. Since 1985, 32 patients in Denver have undergone placement of a cryopreserved aortic valve allograft as part of extended aortic root replacement. There were four hospital deaths (13%), and 1 child underwent cardiac transplantation 30 hours after operation. In 6 months to 4.8 years of follow-up, a 14-year-old boy with familial hyperlipidemia required coronary artery bypass grafting, and 3 children experienced allograft calcification with progressive insufficiency, which prompted allograft replacement. The other 23 patients are clinically well. 
John Caffey Award paper. Avascular necrosis: early MR imaging and histologic findings in a canine model. To examine the early MR and histologic changes of avascular necrosis, we surgically devascularized the distal femur of adult beagle dogs and performed short TR/short TE MR imaging and histologic examinations. MR showed increasing areas of low signal, and histologic examination showed changes of fat necrosis, inflammatory infiltrate, and fibrocytic and bony repair. These processes were divided into four stages. Stage 1 is seen in the first days after surgery and consists of homogeneous high signal on MR and only subtle histologic changes of early fat necrosis. Stage 2, seen by 7 days after surgery, shows linear low-signal areas within the high-signal marrow on MR and fat necrosis and an inflammatory infiltrate on histologic sections. Stage 3, seen by 16 days after surgery, shows patchy low signal occupying more of the marrow on MR with a fibrocytic infiltrate on histologic sections. Stage 4, seen by 23 days after surgery, shows a more homogeneous low and intermediate signal on MR and histologic findings of more organized fibrocytes and the onset of new bone formation. Using this model, we have proved that MR imaging can show marrow changes as soon as 1 week after the onset of avascular necrosis. Whereas MR imaging showed a progression of increasing areas of low signal, the histologic findings seen during this time were diverse, including inflammatory infiltration (a previously unreported finding), fat necrosis, and fibrocytic and osseous repair. 
Low incidence of point mutation at codon 12 of K-ras proto-oncogene in squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. Forty-two cases of squamous cell carcinoma arising in the upper aerodigestive tract were examined to determine the incidence and type of point mutation in codon 12 of the c-K-ras gene by using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide hybridization techniques on DNA extracted from paraffin blocks. DNA sequencing, in addition, was performed in 4 cases. No point mutation was detected in codon 12 of c-K-ras in the 42 squamous cell carcinomas we examined. According to the results of DNA sequencing of 4 cases, codon 13 also revealed no point mutation. Thus, point mutational activation of codon 12 of c-K-ras oncogene is an uncommon event in human upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma. 
Destruction of tumour parenchyma in basal cell carcinoma by tumour-associated neutral proteases: a histochemical study. Proteolytic activity was demonstrated histochemically in frozen sections of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs). After incubation of tissue sections in 0.1 M phosphate buffer with 0.25 M NaCl the tumour epithelium was almost completely destroyed. The basal and squamous cell layers of the epidermis disintegrated to varying degrees, particularly where they were directly in contact with tumour epithelium. Serine and metalloprotease inhibitors diminished this tissue destruction. Iodoacetate enhanced tumour destruction, urea and potassium thiocyanate even more so. The high proteolytic activity of BCC demonstrated in this study may be an important factor in the proliferative, invasive and destructive behaviour of this tumour. 
Giant, human immunodeficiency virus-related ulcers in the esophagus. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the esophagus has recently been implicated as a cause of giant esophageal ulcers in HIV-positive patients with odynophagia. The authors examined four patients in whom esophagograms (one single-contrast and three double-contrast studies) revealed giant, HIV-related ulcers indistinguishable from those of cytomegalovirus (CMV) esophagitis. All four patients had severe odynophagia, one had an associated maculopapular rash, and two became HIV-positive at approximately the time of clinical presentation. In all patients, biopsy samples, brushings, and cultures obtained with endoscopy were negative for CMV or herpes simplex. One patient had positive brushings for candidiasis, but this may have resulted from fungal superinfection of the ulcer. Two patients were treated with orally administered steroids, and all four had swift clinical improvement; symptoms disappeared during an average period of 8.3 days from presentation. HIV-related esophageal ulcers should be distinguished from CMV ulcers, so that appropriate treatment can be initiated in these patients. 
Selegiline (deprenyl) treatment and death of nigral neurons in Parkinson's disease. We studied the effect of selegiline (deprenyl) treatment on the number of Lewy bodies and neuron counts in the substantia nigra in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The number of medial nigral neurons was greater and the number of Lewy bodies fewer in those PD patients who had been treated with selegiline in combination with levodopa as compared with patients who had received levodopa alone. This suggests that selegiline treatment may retard the death of nigral neurons, but alternative explanations, such as the reduction of levodopa dosage in selegiline-treated patients, are possible. 
Simultaneous measurement of all thrombosis parameters from native human blood: usefulness in monitoring efficacy and complications of thrombolytic therapy. The sequelae of thrombus formation, both by shear forces and by collagen fiber, the subsequent coagulation, and the dislodgement of thrombi (thrombolysis) were measured from a small volume of nonanticoagulated blood sample, by a new instrument. Addition of streptokinase (SK) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to the blood sample eliminated the need for anticoagulation for thrombolysis measurement: clot lysis preceded and allowed thrombolysis to occur. The test revealed activation of platelets and coagulation by SK and rt-PA. Apart from this general trend, platelet reactivity in response to plasminogen activator showed great individual variation. Whether the greatly enhanced (42%) or prolonged hemostasis (13%), observed in different blood samples with rt-PA, could be used as a predictor of reocclusion or bleeding complications remains to be established. Thrombolysis did not occur in 12% of the samples tested. These thrombolysis models may be useful for developing new agents for the dissolution of platelet-rich thrombi. It is suggested that this technique be used for monitoring thrombolytic therapy. 
Carcinoma arising within fibroadenomas of the breast. A clinicopathologic study of 105 patients. The authors report the clinicopathologic features of 105 carcinomas arising within fibroadenomas (FAs) of the breast. The mean age of the patients was 44 years. The presentation and gross characteristics of these tumors rarely differed from those of uncomplicated FAs. Carcinoma in situ (CIS) was the predominant type of malignancy (95%) found to arise in FAs, and lobular and ductal types occurred with equal frequency. Nine of ten FAs harboring an invasive carcinoma also contained CIS supporting the origin of the infiltrative component in the FAs. CIS within FAs was associated with in situ malignancy in surrounding breast tissue in 21% of cases. Age, fibroadenoma size, and type and extent of CIS were similar in patients with disease limited to the FA and in those with associated malignant disease in the remainder of the breast. Axillary nodal metastases were not detected. Sixty-three patients were observed for a mean period of 8.4 years. Only one of 26 patients with CIS within an FA who was treated conservatively developed an ipsilateral carcinoma. None of the 26 developed contralateral carcinoma; however, 3 of 23 with similar lesions, who were treated by mastectomy, did so. The contralateral carcinomas were invasive in two patients, one of whom died with distant metastases. Seven patients with FAs harboring lobular CIS underwent bilateral mastectomy. Their postoperative course was uneventful. None of seven patients with invasive carcinoma arising in an FA, two of whom were treated conservatively, succumbed to disease. However, one developed contralateral carcinoma. The authors recommend breast-conserving therapy for CIS arising in an FA. 
A prostacyclin analog impairs the response to tissue-type plasminogen activator during coronary thrombolysis: evidence for a pharmacokinetic interaction. Inhibition of thromboxane (TX) A2 with aspirin enhances the response to coronary thrombolysis. However, experimental evidence suggests that platelet activation during coronary thrombolysis is mediated by a number of agonists, in addition to TXA2. As a consequence, greater benefit would be expected with antiplatelet agents that have a broader spectrum of activity. However, a recent clinical trial, combining tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) with the prostacyclin analog, iloprost, did not detect such a benefit. To address the mechanism of this response, we compared the effect of iloprost, a stable analog of prostacyclin, with GR32191, a TXA2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptor antagonist, on the response to i.v. t-PA in a closed chest, canine model of coronary thrombosis. GR32191 reduced the time to reperfusion by 47% (n = 6, P less than .05), consistent with a role for TXA2-mediated platelet activation in impairing thrombolysis. In contrast, iloprost increased the time to reperfusion by 50% (n = 5, P = NS) and in four of nine animals reperfusion failed to occur despite inhibition of platelet aggregation. In a separate series of experiments, steady-state plasma t-PA clearance increased by 38% (407 +/- 49 vs. 294 +/- 42 ml/min; n = 8, P less than .02) during infusion of iloprost and recovered after its withdrawal. This appeared to be a specific effect, as infusion of nitroglycerin at a dose which induced a similar fall in blood pressure altered neither the time to reperfusion nor plasma t-PA. Iloprost impairs the thrombolytic response to t-PA via an increase in the clearance of this agent. 
Mucosal cell proliferation of the rectal stump in ulcerative colitis patients after ileorectal anastomosis. The proliferative activity and polyamine levels of the rectal epithelium in unoperated ulcerative colitis patients and in ulcerative colitis patients after total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis were determined and compared with control subjects. Cell proliferation was evaluated in rectal biopsies by in vitro 3H thymidine incorporation by measuring the labeling index and the position of labeled cells along the crypt; polyamines were determined with a chromatographic method. In ulcerative colitis patients the labeling index was significantly increased, and labeled cells were shifted toward the upper part of the crypt when compared with controls. Ileorectal anastomosis patients showed a normalization of the labeling index and a distribution of labeled cells similar to controls. Polyamine levels were also increased in ulcerative colitis patients; in ileorectal anastomosis patients, the level of polyamines was decreased in respect to unoperated patients and return to normal values except for spermine. Because the increased proliferation and higher polyamine levels are related to increased colon cancer risk, our results confirm that ulcerative colitis is a risk factor for the development of carcinoma. Ileorectal anastomosis may reduce this risk through a normalization of mucosal cell proliferative activity and of some polyamine levels. 
Simultaneous ipsilateral vasal and epididymal reconstruction. Injuries to the spermatic cords, sustained during childhood inguinal hernioplasty, caused unilateral testicular atrophy, multiple bilateral excurrent duct obstruction and aspermia. Simultaneous unilateral vasal reconstruction and vaso-epididymostomy resulted in satisfactory semen parameters. It is expected that vasal integrity will be maintained after multiple reconstructive procedures at different locations if further injury to the vascular supply of the excurrent duct is avoided. 
Thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase stimulates collagen breakdown. BACKGROUND. Plasmin is capable of degrading extracellular matrix components such as collagen in vitro. To evaluate the significance of this for in vivo conditions, we set out to study the effect of streptokinase, which acts by converting plasminogen to plasmin, on the serum concentrations of the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) and the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP). METHODS AND RESULTS. Twenty-three patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction were included in the study; 17 of them received thrombolytic therapy, and six were treated conservatively. PIIINP and PICP were assayed with radioimmunoassays. Kinetics of creatine kinase-MB release were determined to differentiate reperfusers from nonreperfusers. Composite curves of creatine kinase-MB release were constructed for different patient subgroups. During streptokinase infusion the serum concentrations of PIIINP increased rapidly, with a maximum mean increase of 50% (from 2.2 +/- 0.2 to 3.3 +/- 0.3 micrograms/l) in 45 minutes. A similar increase was also observed in two patients who received thrombolytic therapy but did not subsequently develop any myocardial infarction determined on the basis of enzyme release. The relative increase in PIIINP during streptokinase treatment was higher in those acute myocardial infarction patients with probable reperfusion than those with nonprobable reperfusion. Corresponding changes in PIIINP were not seen in the control group. Two days later there was a second increase in serum PIIINP for both patient groups. This change coincided with a similar increase in PICP. CONCLUSIONS. We conclude that streptokinase, probably by activation of plasminogen to plasmin, stimulates the breakdown of type III collagen during thrombolytic therapy. This phenomenon may decrease the risk of rethrombosis of the affected artery if the exposed collagen is responsible for thrombosis formation, but it could also be involved in the development of hemorrhagic complications during thrombolytic therapy. The second increase in PIIINP levels probably indicates type III collagen synthesis of the infarcted area. This investigation represents a pilot study, and more studies on the effects of various thrombolytic agents on interstitial collagen metabolism are obviously needed. 
Molecular basis of an autoantibody-associated restriction fragment length polymorphism that confers susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Recently, combined serological and molecular studies of autoantibodies have revealed that these antibodies play an important role in the normal function of the immune system and in the development of the B cell repertoire. Accordingly, we hypothesized that a homozygous deletion of a critical autoantibody-associated Ig variable (V) gene may alter the immune system and thus predispose the host to autoimmune disorders. Initial experiments revealed several restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of the Humhv3005 gene, that is likely to encode heavy chains of rheumatoid factors, and the closely related 1.9III gene. By probing EcoR1-digested DNA with the Humhv3005/P1 probe, we found that one of the four major hybridizing bands was missing in approximately 20% of patients with either rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus, but only 2% of normal subjects. To delineate the genetic basis of this polymorphism, we have now employed the PCR to amplify and analyze hv3005, 1.9III, and homologous genes in individuals with characteristic RFLP genotypes. Our results indicate that the human Vh gene repertoire contains several hv3005- and 1.9III-like genes, and that a complete deletion of the hv3005-like genes is relatively restricted to a subset of autoimmune patients. These findings provide initial evidence for deletion of developmentally regulated autoreactive V genes in autoimmune diseases. 
Prognosis for recovery from prolonged posttraumatic unawareness: logistic analysis. This study reviews the course and outcome of 130 patients who remained in a state of prolonged unawareness 30 days after severe cranio-cerebral trauma. Prognostic indicators and outcome were fitted by a logistic model. The significant prognostic factors observable in the first week after trauma were found to be ventilatory status, motor reactivity and significant extraneural trauma. The significant prognostic factors after the first month of unawareness were early ventilatory status, early motor reactivity, late epilepsy and hydrocephalus. The estimated probability of recovery of awareness (that is, consciousness) ranged from 0.94 in patients with early decorticate posturing in the absence of both extraneural trauma and ventilatory disturbance to 0.06 in patients with flaccidity, extraneural trauma and ventilatory disturbance in the first week after injury. 
Antibiotic management of outpatients with endocarditis due to penicillin-susceptible streptococci. Thirty patients with endocarditis caused by penicillin-susceptible streptococci were enrolled in one of two groups in this study. Fifteen patients received ceftriaxone (2 g once daily) for 4 weeks; the other 15 received the same dosage of ceftriaxone for 2 weeks and then received oral amoxicillin (1 g four times a day) for 2 weeks. For the 27 patients treated predominantly as outpatients, 380 days of hospitalization were avoided. Clinical cure was achieved for all patients in both groups. We conclude that ceftriaxone, alone or followed by a course of amoxicillin, is an efficacious mode of treatment for infective endocarditis caused by penicillin-susceptible streptococci. Treatment with these agents can be administered predominantly on an outpatient basis. 
Endoscopic pulsed dye laser lithotripsy of gallbladder calculi in vivo. We have evaluated the efficacy and safety of pulsed dye laser lithotripsy of gallbladder calculi using a percutaneous endoscopic technique in a porcine model. Fragmentation was readily achieved in vivo. Using a combination of laser lithotripsy and saline lavage, complete removal of all stone debris was feasible through a 24 F tract (N = 3). However, the degree of fragmentation required rendered removal through a smaller tract inefficient, a mean 53% of stone mass being retrievable through a 16 F tract (N = 11). Repeated laser activation at 1 mm from the gallbladder mucosa produced minimal injury, regardless of pulse energy. When the laser fiber was pressed against the mucosa, perforation of the gallbladder was possible at therapeutic pulse energy, but this did not lead to clinical sequelae. We conclude that the pulsed dye laser is a safe and effective means of fragmenting gallbladder calculi in vivo. 
Temporal arteritis with normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is used to differentiate temporal arteritis from other forms of headache in the elderly. Though temporal arteritis can occur with a normal ESR, this is not generally appreciated in primary care. The case reported here is a 74-year-old woman with biopsy-proven temporal arteritis; her ESR was 22 mm/hr. Of note, her hematocrit was more than 40 percent, a condition previously reported to be associated with temporal arteritis and a normal ESR. This discussion focuses on the diagnosis of temporal arteritis and its associated symptoms. 
Giant neuroendocrine (Merkel cell) carcinoma of the skin. An 82-year-old woman had a dark red to purple tumor on the left buttock that had gradually enlarged during the last 5 years. Although routine histologic examination was not sufficient for diagnosis, neuroendocrine carcinoma was diagnosed by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies. Immunohistochemical-positive reactions to neurofilament, cytokeratin, neuron-specific enolase, and epithelial membrane antigen were noted. Electron microscopically, membrane-bound, dense core granules that yielded a positive uranaffin reaction and intermediate filaments in the perinuclear area were observed in the cytoplasm of most tumor cells. Desmosome-like structure between them was also found. Approximately 6 months after local excision, metastatic lesions developed in the regional lymph nodes and liver. 
Short-bowel syndrome in children. Quality of life in an era of improved survival. A number of disorders in childhood can result in short-bowel syndrome (small bowel length, less than 100 cm). Improved care has increased survival in patients with short-bowel syndrome, but the quality-of-life factors associated with such improved survival have not been examined, to our knowledge. Sixteen consecutive pediatric patients with short-bowel syndrome (bowel length range, 22 to 98 cm) were followed up for 2 to 10 years. The original diagnoses were as follows: necrotizing enterocolitis (n = 6), multiple intestinal atresias (n = 4), extensive aganglionosis (n = 2), meconium peritonitis (n = 2), and midgut volvulus (n = 2). The range of initial hospitalization was from 62 to 395 days, and 13 of 16 patients have required readmission (two to 14 times). All patients required multiple operations (range, two to 14 operations), including combinations of venous access, adhesiolysis, tapering enteroplasty, reversed intestinal segments, and pull-through procedure. Nine of 16 patients received home total parenteral nutrition, and 12 of 16 patients required home elemental diets, usually via pump feedings. Fifteen patients (94%) survived. Two survivors are deaf, and one of these has mild developmental delay. Seven survivors (age range, 6 to 10 years) attend a regular school, four while receiving total parenteral nutrition or an elemental diet. Ten of 15 survivors are off all nutritional support (including the child with a 22-cm small bowel), with four others weaning. The presence or absence of an ileocecal valve did not affect outcome. Modern nutritional support methods provide excellent survival and quality of life for children with short-bowel syndrome. 
Observations on massive retrieved human allografts. Radiographic and histological studies of sixteen massive retrieved human allografts were carried out after the allografts had been in situ for four to sixty-five months. The studies demonstrated that union between the allograft and the host took place slowly at cortical-cortical junctions by the formation of an external callus derived from the cortex of the host, and it took place more rapidly at cancellous-cancellous junctions by internal callus advancing from the host into the allograft. Internal repair took place very slowly, was confined to the superficial surface and the ends of the graft, and had involved only 20 per cent of the graft by five years. The deep unrepaired portions of the graft retained their architecture, and where bone cement had been used to fix a prosthetic stem or an intramedullary rod to the allograft, there was no evidence of resorption of bone or loosening of the device. Soft tissues of the host became attached to the graft by deposition of a thin seam of new bone on the surface of the graft. A previous fracture of two grafts had healed before the time of retrieval. Analysis of the articular cartilage revealed no evidence that any chondrocytes had survived, even when the graft had been cryoprotected before it was preserved by freezing. The necrotic cartilage functioned well for as long as five years, and as it degenerated, it was covered by a pannus of fibrovascular reparative tissue. Two allografts that had been removed because of rejection were surrounded by an envelope of chronic inflammatory tissue that prevented union, adherence of soft tissue, and internal repair. Internal repair was more advanced about sites of fracture and adjacent to recurrent tumors than in other portions of the graft. These findings suggest that large frozen allografts in humans are osteoconductive rather than osteoinductive. 
Diagnostic accuracy of exercise thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography in patients with left bundle branch block. Recent reports have proposed that abnormal apical or anterior wall perfusion with exercise thallium-201 imaging may increase diagnostic accuracy for disease of the left anterior descending artery in patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB). To evaluate these suggestions, 83 patients with LBBB who underwent thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography and coronary angiography within an interval of 3 months were retrospectively reviewed. There were 59 men and 24 women aged 33 to 84 years (mean 65). Myocardial perfusion to the apex, anterior wall and anterior septum were scored qualitatively by consensus of 2 experienced observers and by quantitative analysis in comparison with a normal data base. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of perfusion defects in these segments were then expressed according to angiographic findings. Significant stenosis of vessels within the left anterior descending artery territory was present in 38 patients. By receiver-operator characteristic analysis, a fixed or reversible defect within the apex by the qualitative method was the best criterion for coronary artery disease. However, although highly sensitive (79 and 85% by the qualitative and quantitative methods, respectively), an apical defect was neither specific (38 and 16%, respectively), nor accurate (57 and 46%, respectively). Perfusion abnormalities in the anterior wall and septum were also of limited diagnostic accuracy. Thus, modified interpretative criteria in patients with LBBB are not clinically useful in the assessment of left anterior descending artery disease. 
Inner ear deafness in Wegener's granulomatosis. Autoimmune deafness represents a heterogeneous group of disorders in which there is though to be inner ear and/or middle ear damage mediated by various immunological abnormalities. We describe a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis in whom there was evidence of significant inner ear damage caused by vasculitis, which was completely reversed by cyclophosphamide and prednisolone. We propose that Wegener's granulomatosis is a cause of autoimmune deafness. 
NIT-1, a pancreatic beta-cell line established from a transgenic NOD/Lt mouse. NOD/Lt mice harboring a hybrid rat insulin-promoter/SV40 large T-antigen gene spontaneously develop beta-cell adenomas. NIT-1 is a pancreatic beta-cell line established from one of these transgenic mice. Immunocytochemical staining of passage 18 cells showed most contained insulin, with less than 5% containing glucagon, and none containing pancreatic polypeptide or somatostatin. Glucagon content radioimmunoassayed in cell extracts was only 0.27% of the insulin content. Two-hour insulin secretion at 16.5 mM glucose was 638 ng/10(6) cells (41% of intracellular content) compared to only 1.3 ng glucagon (32% of intracellular content). Stimulated insulin secretion was consistently observed in response to 11 and 16.5 mM glucose between passages 11 and 19. At passage 19, both theophylline and tolbutamide stimulated insulin secretion at 5.5 mM glucose. Northern-blot analysis confirmed high levels of insulin mRNA but only trace glucagon mRNA and undetectable somatostatin mRNA. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced MHC class I RNA expression was correlated with markedly increased antigen expression at the cell surface. Similarly, a MHC-linked "occult" class I-like antigen detected by Cr release assay only after exposure of standard NOD/Lt islet cells to IFN-gamma was strongly induced by IFN-gamma in NIT-1 cells. Cell surface MHC class II antigen was not constitutively expressed on NIT-1 cells and could not be detected after IFN-gamma incubation, despite demonstration of IFN-gamma-induced Aa, Ab, and Li invariant-chain RNA transcripts. Similarly IFN-gamma induction of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (Icam-1) transcripts was not accompanied by demonstrable cell surface expression of ICAM-1 antigen. 
The frequency and significance of ECG changes after transurethral prostate resection. Although many clinicians routinely recommend a base-line preoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and obtain frequent postoperative ECGs to screen for myocardial infarction or ischemia, the diagnostic utility of screening perioperative ECGs is unknown. The present analysis evaluates the sensitivity and specificity of the perioperative ECG and examines its value as a predictor of early postoperative cardiac events and outcomes during the postoperative year. ECGs obtained preoperatively and on the first 3 postoperative days in 206 men undergoing transurethral prostate resection were analyzed using the Minnesota Code. The occurrence of cardiac events during the operative stay was assessed by measurement of the cardiospecific MB creatine kinase isoenzyme on the first 3 postoperative days and review of the entire clinical course. Twenty-one percent of patients developed postoperative ECG changes, mostly involving the T wave; none had cardiac symptoms or sustained creatine kinase MB elevation. Changes were not significantly more common in men known to have coronary disease. The single patient who had a perioperative myocardial infarction confirmed by enzymes had no codable ECG changes. The specificity of any ECG change for perioperative infarction was 78%; of ST segment changes only, 95%. Only one of the patients (2%) who had postoperative ECG changes had a cardiac event in the year after surgery. Routine perioperative ECGs is of little diagnostic/predictive utility in situations in which the incidence of perioperative myocardial infarction is low. 
Niemann-Pick type B disease. Identification of a single codon deletion in the acid sphingomyelinase gene and genotype/phenotype correlations in type A and B patients. Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease both result from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (E.C. 3.1.4.12). Type A Niemann-Pick disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of infancy which leads to death by three years of age, whereas Type B disease has a later age at onset, little or no neurologic involvement, and most patients survive into adulthood. To investigate the molecular basis for the remarkable phenotypic heterogeneity, the nature of the mutations causing Type B Niemann-Pick disease in Ashkenazi Jewish patients was determined. The entire acid sphingomyelinase coding region from an Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patient was polymerase chain reaction-amplified, subcloned, and completely sequenced. A three-base deletion was identified of nucleotides 1821-1823 in the cDNA which predicted the removal of an arginine residue from position 608 of the acid sphingomyelinase polypeptide (delta R608). The other cDNA clones from this patient had the R496L mutation previously identified in Type A Niemann-Pick disease patients. Both Ashkenazi Jewish Type B patients were heteroallelic for the delta R608 mutation, whereas this allele was not present in 15 unrelated non-Jewish Type B patients, with the notable exception of one mildly affected patient of Arabic descent who was homoallelic for the delta R608 mutation. These results indicate that the delta R608 mutation predicts the Type B Niemann-Pick disease phenotype, even in the presence of the R496L Type A allele, thereby providing the first genotype/phenotype correlation for this lysosomal storage disease. Although only two patients have been studied, it appears that the delta R608 mutation occurs frequently in Type B Niemann-Pick disease patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. 
Development of a highly specific and sensitive molecular probe for detection of cutaneous lymphoma. Using DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of a patient with mycosis fungoides, a highly specific and sensitive molecular probe for the malignant lymphoid cells of this patient was developed. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to selectively amplify the region of the rearrangement of TCR-gamma genes. Randomly inserted nucleotides between rearranged segments (N-region) were used as a specific marker for the malignant lymphoid clone of this patient. Clonal cells in paraffin-embedded tissue of previous and later biopsies were detected. This technique provides a new and unique tool for retrospective detection of early evolving cutaneous lymphoma, as well as for detection of minimal residual and systemic disease. 
Intraoperative transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging used to guide patient selection and operative treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation. BACKGROUND. Intraoperative transesophageal Doppler color flow imaging (TDCF) affords the opportunity to assess mitral valve competency immediately before and after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The purpose of this study was to assess the utility of TDCF to assist in the selection and operative treatment of ischemic mitral regurgitation (MR). METHODS AND RESULTS. Two hundred forty-six patients undergoing surgery for ischemic heart disease were prospectively studied. All had preoperative cardiac catheterization. Catheterization and pre-CPB TDCF were discordant in their estimation of MR in 112 patients (46%). Compared with patients in whom both techniques agreed in estimation of MR, patients with discordance in MR were more likely to have had unstable clinical syndromes at the time of catheterization (79% versus 40%, p less than 0.05) or to have received thrombolytics (16% versus 8%, p less than 0.05). Pre-CPB TDCF resulted in a change in the operative plan with respect to the mitral valve in 27 patients (11%). Because less MR was found by TDCF than catheterization, 22 patients had only coronary bypass grafting when combined coronary bypass and mitral valve surgery had been planned. Because more MR was found by TDCF than catheterization, five patients had combined coronary bypass and mitral valve surgery when coronary bypass alone had been planned. Unsatisfactory results noted by TDCF following mitral valve surgery in five patients resulted in immediate corrective surgery. Cox regression analysis identified residual MR at the completion of surgery to be an important predictor of survival (chi 2 = 21.4) after surgery--more important than patient age (chi 2 = 8.3) or left ventricular ejection fraction (chi 2 = 5.3). CONCLUSIONS. These results indicate that TDCF is useful in guiding patient selection and operative treatment of ischemic MR and that in such patients, intraoperative TDCF should be performed routinely. 
Special considerations in the physical exam of older patients. For diagnostic utility, aspects of the standard physical examination are modified for elderly patients. Special attention is paid to problems that interfere with function, such as gait disorders, incontinence, and hearing and visual loss. Certain findings in cardiac and pulmonary examinations of the elderly require different interpretations. The examination should include the head and neck, chest, back, abdomen, breasts and pelvic area in women, prostate in men, extremities, and skin, as well as mental status. A number of diagnostic maneuvers are used to distinguish changes of normal aging from those associated with disease. 
Thumbtack use for control of presacral bleeding, with description of an instrument for thumbtack application. There is well-known difficulty in controlling hemorrhage from presacral vessels. There are reports on the use of thumbtacks to secure hemostasis in the face of presacral hemorrhage. This communication reports the successful use of thumbtacks to establish presacral hemostasis and describes a simple instrument designed to afford easier and more precise anterior sacral application of thumbtacks. The instrument is easy to make. It was devised because of difficulty encountered with manual placement of hemostatic thumbtacks and the absence of totally satisfactory delivery by any of the standard surgical instruments available. 
Suburethral paraganglioma. Masses presenting beneath the urethra are not uncommon. Besides ureteral diverticula, which account for the vast majority of these masses, a multiplicity of heterogeneous benign and malignant tumors have been encountered in this region. To the best of our knowledge, we report the first case of a neuroendocrine tumor, a paraganglioma, discovered in the anatomical compartment between the urethra and vagina. When evaluating a patient with a suburethral mass, it is important to consider paraganglioma as part of the differential diagnosis because unwitting surgical removal of a functional catecholamine-secreting tumor may precipitate a severe hypotensive episode and/or death. 
The use of anterior Caspar plate fixation in acute cervical spine injury. Optimal management of cervical cord injury in the presence of documented instability and/or compression of neural elements remains a controversial topic. Surgery and internal stabilization of cervical spine fracture/dislocations are effective and well accepted, but controversy exists on the relative merits of the anterior versus the posterior approach as well as the optimal timing of surgical intervention. We report our experience with the Caspar technique and instrumentation for anterior stabilization in 54 patients for acute cervical spine injury. Our series consists of 38 male and 16 female patients whose ages ranged from 16 to 68 years, with a mean age of 29.2 years. Thirty-two of these patients had complete neurological sensory/motor deficits at the time of presentation, eight were neurologically intact, and 14 had preservation of some motor and sensory function. All 54 patients had radiographic evidence of posterior instability as well as anterior disruption of either a vertebral body or intervertebral disk. We found that "early" intervention (less than 24 hours after injury) was performed frequently in the neurologically compromised patients. Twelve of the 22 patients undergoing surgery less than 24 hours after admission regained significant neurological function, with 13 of 22 developing postoperative complications. In the "delayed" group (surgery more than 24 hours after injury, mean 14.3 days), 14 patients experienced postoperative complications, with 15 of 24 demonstrating neurological improvement. The eight patients who were intact did uniformly well. There was no mortality during the follow-up. All 54 patients showed a solid fusion (clinically and radiologically) within 6 months of surgery. In two cases the plates had to be removed, without risking the fusion. Our experience suggests that although anterior cervical fusion and Caspar plating remain appropriate for patients with documented anterior compromise of the canal, it should not substitute for more traditional posterior stabilization procedures. Because this route has the potential for more serious complications, it should be reserved for the cases in which anterior decompression is deemed necessary or posterior fusion was unsuccessful. With appropriate selection of patients, no adverse effect of early surgery was demonstrated. In fact, neurologically compromised patients had the benefits of increased ease of patient care and early transfer to rehabilitation. 
Open, double-blind and long-term study of vigabatrin in chronic epilepsy. We performed an open, double-blind, and long-term study of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl-GABA, GVG) in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy who were receiving only one or at most two standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The novel design included a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase that minimized the number of patients receiving placebo and allowed determination of the optimum dose of GVG for each patient before initiation of the double-blind phase. The study was divided into four phases. The first phase was a 6-week period of baseline observation. In the second phase, GVG was added openly to previous AEDs for 8 weeks. During the first 2 weeks of this phase, the dose of GVG was increased weekly and then, in the absence of adverse effects, was held constant for the next 6 weeks. At the end of this open phase, seizure frequency during the 6 weeks of constant treatment was compared with the baseline seizure frequency for each patient. Patients who experienced reduction greater than 50% in the frequency of any seizure type during the open phase were defined as responders. These responders were then entered into the third and double-blind phase, in which they were randomly allocated wither to continue active GVG treatment or placebo for 8 weeks. Thirty-three patients entered the study; 31 of 33 patients completed the initial open phase. Twenty patients achieved a reduction greater than or equal to 50% in the frequency of one or more seizure types and were eligible for the double-blind phase; 10 were randomized to continue GVG and 10 were randomized to placebo. 
Spatial contrast sensitivity is reduced in bilateral Parkinson's disease. We studied the contrast sensitivity functions of 41 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) with a wide range of parkinsonian symptomatology (Hoehn and Yahr stages 1 to 4) and 22 age-matched control subjects in a parametric design. Results demonstrated reduced contrast sensitivity in PD patients but only in those patients who had progressed beyond Hoehn and Yahr stage 1. Furthermore, there were deficits in contrast sensitivity related to the severity of PD. 
Proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells as shown by in vivo labeling with bromodeoxyuridine. The proliferative activity of normal acinar and ductal breast epithelial cells was studied by in vivo labeling with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) in 26 cases with concurrent breast carcinoma. The BrdUrd-labeled cells were recognized in histologic sections of paraffin-embedded tissue, using an anti-BrdUrd antibody and an immunoperoxidase reaction. The percentage of BrdUrd-labeled cells showed great variability for both acinar (0% to 2.66%; mean, 0.70%; standard deviation [SD], 0.80%) and ductal cells (0% to 1.99%; mean, 0.51%; SD, 0.57%). The fraction of proliferating epithelial cells declined with the age of the patients and was significantly higher in premenopausal women (1.16% +/- 0.85% for acinar and 0.94% +/- 0.60% for ductal cells) as compared with the postmenopausal women (0.27% +/- 0.46% for acinar and 0.17% +/- 0.22% for ductal cells), P less than 0.01 for acinar and P less than 0.001 for ductal cells, respectively. In some patients, great variability in distribution of proliferating acinar and ductal cells among different lobules and ducts was observed. No difference was found in the number of proliferating acinar and ductal cells situated near or far from their corresponding tumors. No correlation was seen between cell proliferation of normal acinar or ductal cells and cell proliferation of the respective tumors. 
The safety of intraaortic balloon pump catheter insertion through suprainguinal prosthetic vascular bypass grafts. To determine the safety of intraaortic balloon pump catheter insertion for critical coronary ischemia through suprainguinal prosthetic bypass grafts, we examined our experience of 19 intraaortic balloon pumps placed through grafts in 17 patients by means of surgical exposure (8) or the percutaneous (11) approach. Fourteen intraaortic balloon pumps were placed through matured grafts at a time remote (2 to 13 years; mean, 7 years) from their vascular bypass surgery. Five were inserted through nonmatured grafts during the same hospitalization as their vascular reconstructive surgery (1 to 12 days; mean, 4 days). One patient, a day after an aortoiliac bypass, died during an urgent, surgical intraaortic balloon pump insertion for cardiogenic shock. All other patients had prompt reversal of their cardiac ischemia. Decreased limb perfusion developed during use of the intraaortic balloon pump in three patients, all of whom had their intraaortic balloon pump placed percutaneously through mature grafts. Two of these required surgical thrombectomy. Ten intraaortic balloon pump insertions in eight patients survived the hospitalization and were followed for a mean of 24 months (range, 2 weeks to 64 months). No localized groin or graft infections were identified. No bleeding complications or pseudoaneurysms occurred. Thus in patients with unstable, severe, cardiac disease, intraaortic balloon pumps can be safely placed through indwelling suprainguinal bypass grafts. 
Vasculitis. A practical approach to management. Vasculitis encompasses a wide variety of diseases. Because diagnosis may be difficult, a careful evaluation is essential, including a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, and appropriate laboratory studies. Diagnosis is based on clinicopathologic features that permit identification of the condition. Biopsies are often necessary to confirm a diagnosis. It is important to accurately categorize the vasculitic disorders, since prompt, aggressive therapy with potentially toxic drugs is necessary to avoid irreversible organ system dysfunction. 
Family and peer issues among adolescents with spina bifida and cerebral palsy. Increasingly, children with disabling conditions are surviving through childhood into adolescence and beyond. This places increased importance on understanding adolescent, family, and peer relationships, which are critical to healthy development among adolescents in general and to transitions to successful adulthood among youths with physical disabilities in particular. The purpose of this study was to identify the patterns of family and peer interactions. One hundred two youths with spina bifida and 60 adolescents with cerebral palsy between the ages of 12 and 22 completed written psychological measures as well as an in-depth structured interview. Approximately 90% of youths with spina bifida and cerebral palsy resided at home, of whom 80.4% and 72% lived with both parents. Almost without exception, parental relationships were defined as positive, with no difference of attitude noted toward the mother and father. Relationships with parents for teenagers with spina bifida were marked by high levels of dependence on parents for personal care such as bowel programs and, for both groups, low levels of responsibility at home and lack of discussion with parents about sexuality or menstruation. Although friends were viewed as very important by most respondents (approximately 83%), relationships were characterized by extremely limited out-of-school contacts, negligible participation with organized social activities, and a primary orientation toward sedentary activities. Finally, regarding heterosexual relationships, whereas 44.1% of respondents with spina bifida and 54.2% of respondents with cerebral palsy said their friends dated, only 14.7% and 28.3% of study participants indicated that they had ever been on a date and, even for those teenagers, heterosexual social contacts were infrequent. 
Barrett's esophagus and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction. Since 1985, 57 patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal (GE) junction have undergone surgical resection. In this group, 16 of the tumors arose in a Barrett's esophagus. There was a significant predilection toward white men above the age of 55 (15/16; 94%) in this subgroup. The mean proximal extent of abnormal columnar involvement was 5.4 cm above the gastroesophageal junction (range 2.5 to 11 cm). The mean location of the neoplasm centered in the distal esophagus 1.8 +/- 0.5 cm above the gastroesophageal junction. During the same time period, 30 patients with Barrett's esophagus were seen without associated adenocarcinoma. There were no statistical differences in the proximal extent of columnar involvement or the presence of reflux symptoms between the two groups. There were no significant differences in age, smoking history, and alcohol consumption between patients with benign or malignant Barrett's esophagus as compared to those with adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal junction not associated with Barrett's mucosa. The marked male predominance seen in the group with malignant Barrett's esophagus was in contrast to the benign cases (16/30; 53%) but was similar to the adenocarcinoma group, without recognized Barrett's esophagus (38/41; 93%). The mean location of the tumor in the latter was 0.9 +/- 1.2 cm above the gastroesophageal junction and was comparable to the location in the group with Barrett's adenocarcinoma. The 4-year survival rate of patients in the non-Barrett's adenocarcinoma group is approximately 30%. Of those with Barrett's adenocarcinoma, the present 4-year survival rate is 60%. The demographic and morphometric similarities between the Barrett's and non-Barrett's adenocarcinoma groups may be of primary importance in determining the true clinical prevalence of Barrett's adenocarcinoma. Our findings suggest that the sensitivity of endoscopic surveillance may be improved if biopsy specimens are concentrated within the distal 3 cm of the esophagus and the esophagogastric junction. Finally, the reason for the current difference in survival between the Barrett's and non-Barrett's adenocarcinoma groups is uncertain but may be related to endoscopic surveillance permitting earlier diagnosis and treatment. 
Selective peripheral denervation for torticollis: preliminary results Herein we report the preliminary results in nine patients who have undergone selective peripheral denervation for spasmodic torticollis and have been followed up for at least 13 months. All patients had improvement immediately after surgical intervention, and the results have been maintained in five patients. In one patient who had recurrent torticollis, a second procedure in conjunction with injection of botulinum toxin has produced substantial improvement; however, follow-up was brief (6 months). No surgical complications occurred. We believe that selective peripheral denervation is safe and that it can benefit patients with torticollis who have not responded to other types of therapy. These favorable results confirm other published reports on the efficacy of selective peripheral denervation. Long-term follow-up, however, is necessary for determining the role of this procedure in the management of torticollis. 
Hemodynamics in the prone jackknife position during surgery. We examined the hemodynamic changes occurring with prone jackknife positioning during colorectal surgery. The operative procedure was restorative proctocolectomy with ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis in five patients with adenomatosis coli and six patients with ulcerative colitis and anoabdominal resection of the rectum with colonic J-pouch anal anastomosis in eight patients with rectal cancer. Nineteen patients (10 men and 9 women aged 41 +/- 19 years) were monitored with arterial and Swan-Ganz catheters during positioning. Measurements were obtained in the supine and prone positions (1 minute, 3 minutes), and the jackknife position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes), as well as before and after adoption of the Lloyd-Davies position (1, 3, 5, and 10 minutes). Turning the patient from the supine position to the prone position resulted in a significant decrease in the cardiac index (CI). However, following head-down rotation, the CI increased and returned to the value seen in the supine position (p less than 0.05). Heart rate (HR) slowed and mean arterial pressure (MAP) increased in the prone jackknife position. We concluded that the extent of the changes in cardiac function presented no serious problems. 
The effect of endoscopic laser therapy on survival in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Further experience. Although endoscopic laser therapy is effective for symptom palliation in esophageal cancer, few studies have investigated its effect on survival. We previously reported a 300% improvement in survival in 10 patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus after endoscopic Nd:YAG laser energy. We now report a study to determine if the survival advantage persisted after treating an additional 26 patients. Thirty-six patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus treated with endoscopic laser therapy were compared to 20 controls identified by our hospital Tumor Registry. There was no difference between the groups with respect to age, sex, race, location of tumor, or clinical stage. More control patients (25%) had previously undergone surgery than laser patients (0%) (p less than 0.05). Survival analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (p less than 0.05), with an improvement in median survival from 5.7 to 9.7 months (p less than 0.05). One-year survival was 38% in laser patients, compared to 20% in control patients. Our experience continues to demonstrate that endoscopic laser therapy is effective in prolonging life as well as palliating the symptoms of patients with squamous-cell esophageal carcinoma. 
Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome: megalencephaly and heterotopic gray matter. A 3-month-old white male with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS), facial deformities, brain malformations, and cortical blindness is presented. Facial deformities included left ear hypertrophy and a left-sided hamartomatous neck mass. Magnetic resonance imaging suggested that a central nervous system (CNS) abnormality, involving gray and white matter, should be linked with LNSS. Magnetic resonance imaging was more useful than computed tomography in demonstrating the full spectrum of CNS anomalies, including unilateral lissencephaly, a paucity of white matter, excessive and heterotopic gray matter, apparent left schizencephaly, and unilateral left colpocephaly (dilation of atrium and posterior horn of lateral ventricle). Postmortem examination revealed left hemisphere megalencephaly with a dilated posterior horn of the lateral ventricle. The impressive gray matter heterotopias likely were the source of the patient's seizures and perhaps the ultimate cause of death. Megalencephaly and other deviations of neuronal migration should be considered as a dramatic component of LNSS. 
Evaluation and treatment of aneurysms of the vertebral artery: different strategies for different lesions. Aneurysms of the vertebral artery and its branches are relatively uncommon lesions. Their anatomy and presentation can be quite variable. A spectrum of aneurysms of the vertebral artery is presented to illustrate the neuroradiological evaluation, surgical treatment, and perioperative management of these complex lesions. 
Autoimmune Addison's disease and thyrotoxic thyroiditis presenting as encephalopathy in twins. An 11 year old boy who presented with neuropsychiatric symptoms including delirium and pronounced agitation was found to have simultaneous onset of autoimmune adrenocortical insufficiency and hyperthyroidism. His identical twin also had hyperthyroidism and six months later developed symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency. In children presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms, adrenal (or pituitary) and other endocrine disorders should be considered. 
Evidence for WT1 as a Wilms tumor (WT) gene: intragenic germinal deletion in bilateral WT. The inactivation of two alleles at a locus on the short arm of chromosome 11 (band 11p13) has been suggested to be critical steps in the development of Wilms tumor (WT), a childhood kidney tumor. Two similar candidate WT cDNA clones (WT33 and LK15) have recently been identified on the basis of both their expression in fetal kidney and their location within the smallest region of overlap of somatic 11p13 deletions in some tumors. These homozygous deletions, however, are large and potentially affect more than one gene. Using a cDNA probe to the candidate gene, we have analyzed DNA from both normal and tumor tissue from WT patients, in an effort to detect rearrangements at this locus. We report here a patient with bilateral WT who is heterozygous for a small (less than 11 kb) germinal deletion within this candidate gene. DNA from both tumors is homozygous for this intragenic deletion allele, which, by RNA-PRC sequence analysis, is predicted to encode a protein truncated by 180 amino acids. These data support the identification of this locus as an 11p13 WT gene (WT1) and provide direct molecular data supporting the two-hit mutational model for WT. 
Membranous nephropathy related to hepatitis B virus in adults. BACKGROUND. The natural course of adult hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related membranous nephropathy in areas where HBV infection is endemic (characterized by vertical and horizontal transmission of HBV in early childhood) has not been fully defined. METHODS. We evaluated the clinical features, pathological findings, serologic profiles, therapeutic responses, and prognoses of 21 patients with adult-onset HBV-related membranous nephropathy. The patients were followed for a mean of 60 months (range, 12 to 108). Only patients with evidence of glomerular capillary deposition of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) in a renal-biopsy specimen were included. RESULTS. The clinical features and serologic studies suggested that the patients had acquired chronic HBV infection in early childhood; moreover, other causes of membranous nephropathy had been excluded. All were seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen and had high titers of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen at first clinical presentation. HBeAg was detected in the serum of 17 patients (81 percent), yet only 3 had even slightly increased plasma alanine aminotransferase levels. The clinical response to therapy with interferon alfa was disappointing; only one of the five patients treated had a complete remission with seroconversion to antibody to HBeAg. Contrary to reports of studies in children, spontaneous remission of the nephrotic syndrome or proteinuria was uncommon in the adults with HBV-related membranous nephropathy whom we studied. Proteinuria and HBV antigenemia persisted in untreated patients. During the follow-up period, 29 percent of the patients had progressive renal failure and 10 percent required maintenance dialysis therapy. CONCLUSIONS. The course of HBV-related membranous nephropathy in adults in areas where HBV is endemic is not benign. Regardless of treatment, the disease has a slowly but relentlessly progressive clinical course in approximately one third of patients. 
Bilateral nephrectomy before transplantation: indications, surgical approach, morbidity and mortality. Forty patients with end-stage renal failure, who had undergone simultaneous bilateral native nephrectomy before a subsequent renal transplant operation, were reviewed with particular reference to the indications and surgical approach for bilateral nephrectomy and to the complications of the procedure. The main indications for bilateral nephrectomy are hypertension resistant to medical therapy, persistent symptomatic renal infection, severe renal protein loss and occasionally polycystic kidneys or bilateral renal tumours. In this consecutive series of 40 patients both kidneys were removed because of chronic pyelonephritis with reflux (n = 28), glomerulonephritis with reflux (n = 9) and uncontrolled hypertension (n = 3). Surgical morbidity was less in patients who had bilateral nephrectomy performed through bilateral vertical lumbotomy incisions. There was no surgical mortality. 
Effect of i.v. midazolam on the ventilatory response to sustained hypoxia in man. The ventilatory response to isocapnic, sustained hypoxia is characterized by initial hyperventilation followed by ventilatory decline. The ventilatory response to isocapnic sustained hypoxia during i.v. administration of midazolam was assessed in five healthy subjects. Compared with control experiments, the hyperventilatory effect of hypoxia was not decreased following administration of midazolam. The hypoxic ventilatory change was significantly greater with midazolam because of a decrease in tidal volume. 
Hypertension as a risk factor for renal disease. Review of clinical and epidemiological evidence Renal failure is a well-recognized complication of accelerated and malignant hypertension that can be prevented by appropriate antihypertensive therapy. The risk of renal disease in patients with milder forms of hypertension is less certain. Death certificate, insurance industry, and community-based observational studies provide little information with respect to the risk of kidney damage in the hypertensive patient. Randomized controlled trials of antihypertensive drug therapy provide equivocal results. The strongest evidence in support of the hypothesis that mild hypertension increases the risk of subsequent renal disease comes from analyses of the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program and the Medicare End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Program. The risk of blood pressure-related ESRD appears to be especially high in blacks, independent of age, sex, and prevalence of hypertension. Although these results need to be confirmed, the data raise the possibility that the effects of high blood pressure on the kidney are different in blacks than in whites. Based on current trends, it is projected that the number of beneficiaries in the Medicare ESRD Program will continue to increase during the next 30-40 years and that the diagnosis of hypertensive ESRD will become increasingly common. Additional studies to characterize the relation between mild hypertension and subsequent risk of renal disease and to confirm the corresponding benefits of antihypertensive therapy are urgently needed. 
Sudden cardiac death: management of high-risk patients Sudden cardiac death remains a leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 350,000 deaths each year, and the survival rate of victims remains low. Most survivors face a significant risk for recurrence. The typical substrate is chronic--abnormal myocardium with fibrosis (often from previous myocardial infarction) and left ventricular dysfunction. Acute triggers for sudden cardiac death are primarily electrical, ischemic, metabolic, neurohormonal, and pharmacologic. In most electrocardiographically documented cases of sudden cardiac death, the trigger-substrate interaction appears to result in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. After initial resuscitation, survivors need a thorough cardiovascular evaluation, including definition of coronary anatomy, left ventricular function, and wall-motion abnormalities, as well as an electrophysiologic evaluation. An attempt must be made to determine what each survivor's correctable triggers are. Management should address all reversible triggers, such as acute ischemia and electrolyte abnormalities, and should include modifying or correcting the arrhythmogenic substrate. Empiric antiarrhythmic therapy offers no advantage in such modification. Pharmacologic therapy with antiarrhythmic drugs should be guided by an objective therapeutic endpoint, which is best accomplished through the use of programmed ventricular stimulation and serial electrophysiologic studies. Other therapeutic options include surgical suppression of ventricular tachycardia and implantation of a cardioverter defibrillator. 
Myocardial protection with Hamburg oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution for multiple coronary bypass and multivalvular replacement. We evaluated myocardial protection with Hamburg oxygenated crystalloid cardioplegic solution in a double study. Part I was a prospective metabolic study, measuring myocardial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and creatine phosphate (CP) contents before and after ischemia in 30 coronary bypass (CABG) patients. During ischemia, CP levels decreased significantly, whereas ATP did not. After 10 minute of reperfusion, mean ATP contents were 90% of preischemic values and CP levels increased to 85% of preischemic values. Spontaneous myocardial defibrillation was seen in 93.3% of patients. Part II included evaluation of early postischemic myocardial function in 228 patients, 48 with multiple valve replacement (MUVR) and 180 with CABG. Spontaneous myocardial defibrillation was seen in 90.3%. Cardiac index, measured before and 1 and 12 hours after surgery, increased significantly in the postischemic period (from 1.95 +/- 0.9 to 2.5 +/- 0.7 l/min m2 in MUVR, p 0.04; from 2.2 +/- 0.6 to 2.7 +/- 0.7 l/min/m2 in CABG, p 0.01). Myocardial infarction frequency was 3% among CABG patients, and unrelated to the number of distal anastomosis or to aortic cross-clamp time. Early postoperative mortality was 6.2% for MUVR and 0.5% for CABG. Thus, oxygenated cardioplegia with Hamburg solution preserves high-energy phosphate compounds and prevents ischemic injury, with excellent short-term clinical results. 
Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions and alpha-fetoprotein in adenomatous hyperplasia in human cirrhotic livers. Recently, adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver has been suspected as a precancerous lesion in human hepatocarcinogenesis. The authors examined 75 cases of AH from 42 cirrhotic livers, using staining of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs). These reflect proliferative cell activity. Findings in AH were compared with those seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other chronic liver diseases. Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined immunohistochemically. The authors classified AH into three types: ordinary (OAH), atypical (AAH), and AH with focal malignancy (FM). OAH implies a lack of atypia; AAH represents AH with structural and cellular atypia but without the features of overt carcinoma; and FM denotes AH with foci of overt HCC. Forty of the 75 cases of AH were categorized as OAH, 19 as AAH, and 16 as FM. The noncancerous areas of FM had features of AAH. The mean number of AgNORs in AH was intermediate between that seen in cirrhosis (2.93) and HCC (6.18) and showed a step-wise increase in the following order: OAH (2.95), AAH (3.89), noncancerous areas in FM (4.58), and malignant foci in FM (5.71). There was no significant difference in AgNOR counts between OAH and cirrhosis. AgNOR counts in AAH and FM were significantly higher than those of OAH, and lower than those of HCC. AFP was positive in 12 of 25 HCCs and in malignant foci of 3 FM lesions, but it was absent in OAH and AAH. These data suggest that OAH has a limited capacity for proliferation but that AAH and FM are much more replicative. The latter two conditions are probably preneoplastic lesions or early forms of HCC. 
Hepatocellular carcinoma in Italian patients with cirrhosis BACKGROUND AND METHODS. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are recognized as being at risk for hepatocellular carcinoma. The magnitude of the risk, the natural history of this disease, and the possibilities for detecting potentially curable tumors in patients in the Western world are unknown. To address these questions, we examined 447 Italian patients with well-compensated cirrhosis (which was of viral origin in 62 percent of them) from 1985 through 1990, performing serum alpha-fetoprotein assays and real-time ultrasonography every 3 to 12 months. RESULTS. Hepatocellular carcinoma was found in 30 patients (7 percent) at base line and in another 29 patients (7 percent of 417 patients free of tumor at base line) during follow-up periods averaging 33 months (range, 1 to 48). The cumulative hazard of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma during follow-up was higher among patients with persistently elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein levels (12 with tumors among 42 with such levels) than among those with fluctuating levels (11 among 82) or those with consistently normal levels (6 among 255). Only 17 patients had potentially operable tumors. The proportion of potentially operable tumors among those detected during follow-up was significantly lower than the proportion at enrollment (4 of 29 vs. 13 of 30, P = 0.027). The survival at one year of the 12 patients who underwent surgery was 67 percent, and the tumor-recurrence rate was 60 percent. Outcome was not appreciably different for the five patients who refused surgery. CONCLUSIONS. In the West, as in Asia, patients with cirrhosis of the liver are at substantial risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, with a yearly incidence rate of 3 percent. Our screening program did not appreciably increase the rate of detection of potentially curable tumors. 
Dual modulation of 5-fluorouracil using leucovorin and hydroxyurea. A phase I trial. Oral hydroxyurea (HU) was added to a regimen of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus leucovorin (LCV) administered as a continuous 24-hour infusion for 14 days. A previous report of the 5-FU plus LCV infusion established optimal dosages of 200 mg/m2/d and 5 mg/m2/d, respectively, for each agent. Oral HU was added to the regimen in total dosages of 0.5 g/d, 1.0 g/d, 1.5 g/d, or 2.0 g/d. Twenty-two patients received a total of 45 courses of treatment. Stomatitis was the dose-limiting side effect; it occurred in 3 of 14 courses with HU at 0.5 g/d (21%) and 9 of 17 courses with HU at 1.0 g/d (53%). Dosage escalation to 1.5 g/d or 2.0 g/d was possible in only 3 of 22 patients (17%). The median time to stomatitis was 10 days (range, 7 to 12 days). One response was observed in this heavily pretreated population. Phase II trials of HU plus LCV dual modulation of infusional 5-FU should use initial HU dosages of 0.5 g/d for the 14-day regimen described, with dose escalation as tolerated. Variable oral absorption presumably accounts for the small group of patients who can tolerate the higher doses of HU. 
Preservation of urine voiding and sexual function after rectal cancer surgery In order to decrease the urinary and sexual morbidity which follows radical pelvic lymphadenectomy for rectal cancer, we began selective preservation of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Between 1985 and 1987, 134 patients with rectal cancer underwent a curative resection (52 abdominoperineal resections, 82 sphincter-saving resections) with extended pelvic lymphadenectomy and selective pelvic autonomic nerve preservation (PANP). PANP was classified into five degrees depending on the extent of pelvic dissection. First-degree PANP indicates complete preservation of the nerves; second-degree PANP indicates destruction of the hypogastric plexus: third-degree PANP indicates partial preservation of the pelvic autonomic plexus; fourth-degree PANP indicates bilateral or unilateral preservation of only the fourth pelvic parasympathetic nerve; and fifth-degree PANP indicates complete destruction of the pelvic autonomic nerves. Most patients with first-degree PANP were able to spontaneously void 7-10 days following the operation. However, 78 percent (28/36) of patients with fifth-degree PANP had not regained bladder sensation by the third postoperative week and were discharged with an indwelling catheter; 58 percent (21/36) had not regained bladder sensation by the 60th postoperative day. The cystometric data indicate a progressive decline in bladder sensation and function with increasingly extensive pelvic dissection. However, preservation of only the fourth parasympathetic nerve (fourth-degree PANP) resulted in partial sparing of bladder sensation and voiding function. Evaluation of sexual function in males under 60 years of age revealed that only 31 percent (12/39) recovered erectile function and only 19 percent (6/39) recovered normal ejaculatory function in the first postoperative year. Most of these patients had complete preservation of their pelvic autonomic plexus (i.e., first-degree PANP). Four patients with partial PANP have recovered erectile function. Complete PANP is the best way to prevent urinary and sexual morbidity after rectal resection. The opposing goals of maximizing the chance for cure and minimizing morbidity must be individualized and balanced in each patient. Our data demonstrate that it is now possible to perform radical pelvic lymphadenectomy in the majority of patients with advanced rectal cancer with a minimum of voiding dysfunction. Preservation of sexual function in males is more difficult and depends on complete PANP and, as such, should be restricted to the group of patients with Dukes' A and B carcinomas. 
Comparison of the combined effects of atropine and neostigmine with atropine and edrophonium on the lower oesophageal sphincter. In two groups (n = 11) of healthy patients, we have measured gastric, lower oesophageal and barrier pressures before and after antagonism of neuromuscular block during anaesthesia with nitrous oxide and isoflurane. In one group, atropine 1.2 mg and neostigmine 2.5 mg were given and in the second group atropine 0.6 mg with edrophonium 1 mg/kg. One minute after administration of the reversal agents, there was a significantly greater reduction in barrier pressures in the neostigmine and atropine group than in the edrophonium and atropine group, but subsequently, there was no significant difference between the two groups. We conclude that there is no clinical difference between the two reversal mixtures in terms of the risk of regurgitation in the immediate period after reversal. 
Hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia: specific findings at dynamic contrast-enhanced US with carbon dioxide microbubbles. Dynamic contrast material-enhanced ultrasonography (US) with intraarterial infusion of carbon dioxide microbubbles was performed for four cases of histologically proved focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in four patients and for 167 cases of various hepatic nodules in 144 patients. No complications due to dynamic US were observed in any of the 148 patients. All FNH nodules were less than 3 cm in diameter. Consistent specific findings of FNH were not obtained with US, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, radiocolloid scanning, or angiography in the four cases of FNH. In contrast, the characteristic vascular pattern (ie, early central hypervascular supply with centrifugal filling to the periphery at the arterial phase and a uniform or lobulated dense stain at the capillary phase) was observed in all four cases of FNH with dynamic US. This vascular pattern demonstrated in FNH with dynamic US was not seen in any of the 167 hepatic nodules, including 44 small hepatocellular carcinomas less than 3 cm in diameter. Therefore, the newly developed, dynamic contrast-enhanced US technique seems to be extremely sensitive and specific for diagnosing FNH and is useful in the differentiation of FNH from other hepatic tumors, especially hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Immunohistochemical analysis of neural cell adhesion molecules. Differential expression in small round cell tumors of childhood and adolescence. The neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) was discovered in a search for cell surface antigens of chicken neurons that contribute to cell adhesion and pattern formation during development. Homologous adhesion molecules have been identified in several species, including humans. In this immunohistochemical study, the authors examine the role of human NCAM in tumor diagnosis. The authors used a monoclonal antibody (MAb), 5.1H11, to examine NCAM immunoreactivity in frozen sections of more than 450 tumors, including more than 80 small round cell tumors (SRCT) of childhood and adolescence (neuroblastomas, Ewing's sarcomas [ES], peripheral neuroepitheliomas [PN], primitive neuroectodermal tumors [PNET], esthesioneuroblastomas, malignant ectomesenchymoma, medulloblastomas, small cell osteosarcomas, mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, and lymphomas). The authors show that 1) neuroblastomas and primary brain tumors are NCAM+; 2) ES, most PN/PNETs, and melanomas are NCAM-; 3) embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas and various other sarcomas are NCAM+; 4) neuroendocrine tumors are NCAM+; 5) subsets of carcinomas of kidney, ovary, lung and other organs are NCAM+; and 6) lymphoid tumors are NCAM-. Tests with normal fetal and adult tissues indicate that these findings reflect only in part the NCAM phenotypes of corresponding normal tissues. Notably the NCAM- phenotype of ES and PN/PNET is not explained by current histogenetic models for these tumors, which suggest a primitive neuroectodermal origin. Finally the authors show that NCAM expression among SRCT has an inverse relationship with the expression of p30/32MIC2, a cell surface antigen of ES and PN/PNET detected with MAb HBA71. These results suggest that immunohistochemical assays for NCAM and p30/32MIC2 expression may aid in the further characterization of SRCT of childhood and adolescence. 
Effects of distention and short-term grafting on vasoreactivity in rabbit external jugular veins. The relative effects of distention, intraluminal pressure, and wall tension on venous smooth muscle and endothelial cell function were examined in 40 external jugular veins from New Zealand white rabbits. Vein grafts (n = 5) were interposed in the common carotid artery and explanted after 10 minutes. Distended veins were inflated in vitro with modified Krebs' solution at 37 degrees C for 10 minutes at pressures of either 20 mm Hg (D-20; n = 5) or 80 mm Hg (D-80; n = 5). Externally supported veins (ES-80; n = 5) were inflated at 80 mm Hg pressure, but distention was prevented by covering with a 3 mm internal diameter polytetrafluoroethylene sleeve. Bradykinin-induced in vitro maximal tension was attenuated significantly in vein grafts (0.13 +/- 0.04 g) and D-80 rings (0.27 +/- 0.07 g) compared with D-20 rings (1.20 +/- 0.14 g), ES-80 rings (0.99 +/- 0.13 g), or nondistended control rings (n = 40; 1.19 +/- 0.10 g; p less than 0.001). The attenuation in contraction in the vein graft and D-80 groups was nonspecific (i.e., similar results were obtained with respect to other smooth muscle agonists). Contractile function was inversely associated with wall tension, the product of pressure and radius (r2 = 0.7438; p = 0.06). In contrast, there were no differences in endothelium-dependent or endothelium-independent relaxation among the five groups. It is concluded that, in this experimental system, (1) venous smooth muscle function is significantly attenuated after short-term in vitro distention or grafting although endothelial function is largely preserved, and (2) the decrement in contraction is due to elevated wall tension. 
Differential effects of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I and IGF-II on the expression of IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) in a rat neuroblastoma cell line: isolation and characterization of two forms of IGFBP-4. The isolation and hormonal regulation of two low molecular weight insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) present in the conditioned medium (CM) of the rat neuroblastoma cell line B104 cells has been performed. IGFBPs were purified by ZnSO4 precipitation, insulin-like growth factor-I 1IGF-I) affinity chromatography, and reverse phase HPLC. Final isolation and N-terminal analysis was accomplished by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and sequencing of the bound proteins. Two IGFBPs, with apparent Mr of 28K and 24K were coisolated and sequenced. Both proteins had identical N-terminal sequences and appear to be two forms of IGFBP-4. Treatment of the IGFBPs with endoglycosidase-F caused a shift in the apparent Mr of the 28K IGFBP to 24K. However, there was no change in the apparent Mr of the 24K IGFBP. The data from this study suggest that the IGFBP-4 exists as both a glycosylated and nonglycosylated protein. Treatment of B104 cells with IGF-I increased the expression of both the 24K and 28K IGFBPs and also resulted in the appearance of IGFBP-3 and an unknown IGFBP at 29K. When added to subconfluent cells, IGF-I was also mitogenic in B104 cells. Similar to IGF-I, IGF-II treatment increased cell number and resulted in the appearance of IGFBP-3 and the 29K IGFBP. However, IGF-II treatment resulted in a significant decrease (approximately 50%) in the 24K IGFBP and also decreased the 28K IGFBP. This decrease in the expression of the 24K and 28K IGFBPs was dose-dependent and was blocked by addition of IGF-I to the cells. When an IGF-II receptor antibody was added to the cells it mimicked the effects of IGF-II on B104 cells, suggesting that the inhibitory effects of IGF-II are mediated through the type II IGF receptor. Although both IGF-I and IGF-II affected the amount of the 24K IGFBP in the CM, neither peptide affected the expression of the messenger RNA for the 24K IGFBP. In conclusion, we have isolated two IGFBPs from the CM of B104 cells. Both the 24K and 28K IGFBPs appear to be isoforms of the same protein, and sequence data suggest these proteins are two forms of IGFBP-4. IGF-I increases the expression of both of these IGFBPs, whereas IGF-II decreases their expression.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Ki-67 immunostaining in node-negative stage I/II breast carcinoma. Significant correlation with prognosis. Prognostic predictors for node-negative breast carcinoma have not been clearly established. Immunostaining with Ki-67 antibody was performed on frozen sections of histologically proved node-negative breast carcinomas from 42 patients to examine its prognostic value and its association with other clinicopathologic and biochemical parameters, i.e., patient age and tumor size, histologic type, nuclear grade, mitotic rate, presence of vascular or lymphatic invasion, DNA ploidy, percentage of cells in S-phase, estrogen content, and c-erbB-2 amplification. Thirty-seven of the 42 tumors showed immunoreactivity with Ki-67 antibody in 1% to 55% of the tumor cells. A strongly significant correlation was observed between Ki-67 staining percentage and, respectively, nuclear grade, age, and mitotic rate. Nuclear grade 1 (the most anaplastic) tumors showed a significantly higher median percentage of cells stained (median, 14; range, 3 to 40) compared with nuclear grade 3 tumors (median, 0.5; range, 0 to 8). Thirteen patients developed recurrence; six of them died of disease. On univariate analysis, both 5-year disease-free and overall survivals were strongly associated with percentage of cells stained with Ki-67 antibody. Our results suggest that Ki-67 immunostaining correlates well with nuclear grade and clinical outcome in node-negative breast carcinoma. Because of small sample size analyzed in this study we were unable to do multivariate analysis. Therefore, further studies with larger number of cases are needed to determine whether tumor proliferative activity determined by Ki-67 immunostaining is an independent prognostic parameter or it merely reflects histopathologic features such as nuclear grade or mitotic activity. 
Radiologic findings of clonorchiasis. Clonorchiasis is a trematodiasis caused by chronic infestation of liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis. The adult flukes reside in the medium-sized and small intrahepatic bile ducts and, occasionally, in the extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct. The result is mechanical obstruction, inflammatory reaction, adenomatous hyperplasia, and periductal fibrosis. Signs and symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific, but heavy infestation results in obstructive jaundice. The disease has a close relationship with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma. In this article, the radiologic findings, including cholangiography, sonography, and CT of clonorchiasis are reviewed in light of the pathophysiology of the disease. The relationship to recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and to cholangiocarcinoma is discussed. 
Exercise supplementation of dipyridamole for myocardial perfusion imaging [editorial; comment] The substitution of intravenous dipyridamole for symptom-limited treadmill exercise has provided a non-invasive means to diagnose coronary artery disease with 201Tl scintigraphy in patients unable to adequately exercise. Limitations of dipyridamole/thallium imaging are primarily due to suboptimal image quality secondary to hepatic tracer concentration and decreased test sensitivity in patients who are dipyridamole "non-responders." Low-level treadmill exercise supplementation improves image quality, whereas handgrip has little, if any, benefit. The effect of low-level exercise in augmenting coronary blood flow is unknown and reports regarding the effect of handgrip are conflicting. The diagnostic benefit of these maneuvers in improving test sensitivity and decreasing the number of "non-responders" has not been documented. The combination of maximal, symptom-limited treadmill exercise and intravenous dipyridamole is a theoretically attractive option to improve overall test sensitivity, but the physiologic consequences and potential side effects should be more thoroughly investigated. 
Serum bupivacaine concentrations following wound infiltration in children undergoing inguinal herniotomy. Serum bupivacaine concentrations were measured in 12 children who underwent elective herniotomy and who received analgesia in the form of wound infiltration. Mean (SD) peak concentration was 0.36 (0.14) micrograms/ml and time to peak concentration was 14.6 (7.2) minutes after infiltration of 1.25 mg/kg of bupivacaine. These concentrations are lower than those associated with other local anaesthetic blocks and well below potentially toxic levels. Wound infiltration provides a simple, effective and safe method of providing postoperative analgesia for hernia repair in children. 
Effect of very low birth weight and subnormal head size on cognitive abilities at school age BACKGROUND. We tested the hypothesis that very-low-birth-weight (less than 1.5 kg) infants with perinatal growth failure whose head size is not normal by eight months of age (corrected for prematurity) have significantly poorer growth and neurocognitive abilities at school age than very-low-birth-weight children with a normal head size at eight months. We also hypothesized that these differences would persist even after control for major neurologic impairment and perinatal and sociodemographic risk factors. METHODS. We have followed a cohort of very-low-birth-weight children since their birth during the period 1977 to 1979. At eight to nine years of age 249 children were evaluated with a neurologic examination and tests of intelligence; receptive and expressive language skills; speech, reading, mathematics, and spelling aptitude; visual and fine motor abilities; and behavior. Ages were corrected for premature birth. RESULTS. Among these 249 very-low-birth-weight children, head size was subnormal (less than the mean -2 SD for age) at birth in 30 (12 percent), at term in 57 (23 percent), and at eight months in 33 (13 percent). As compared with the 216 children with normal head sizes, the 33 children with subnormal head sizes at the age of eight months had significantly lower mean birth weights (1.1 vs. 1.2 kg) and higher neonatal risk scores (71 vs. 53) and at the age of eight years had a higher incidence of neurologic impairment (21 percent vs. 8 percent) and lower IQ scores (mean verbal, 84 vs. 98). Even among the children without neurologic abnormalities, a subnormal head size at eight months of age was predictive of poorer verbal and performance IQ scores at eight years of age; lower scores for receptive language, speech, reading, mathematics, and spelling; and a higher incidence of hyperactivity. In multiple regression analyses to control for socioeconomic and neonatal risk factors, intrauterine growth failure, birth weight, and neurologic impairment, a subnormal head size at eight months of age had an independently adverse effect on IQ and on scores for receptive language, speech, reading, and spelling. CONCLUSIONS. In very-low-birth-weight infants, perinatal growth failure, as evidenced by a subnormal head circumference at eight months of age, is associated with poor cognitive function, academic achievement, and behavior at eight years of age. 
Central nervous system monitoring. What helps, what does not. The ICU monitoring of CNS function can make a difference in the clinical outcome. No single technique addresses the multiple issues that arise in the ICU setting, especially for the polytrauma patient. Multimodality approaches combining assessment of cerebral blood flow, electrophysiologic parameters, and intracranial pressure, when appropriate, with cardiac and respiratory monitors are being developed at a number of traumatology centers world wide. Experience needs to be gained to establish the best combination of these modalities. Pending this, selected use of intracranial pressure monitoring combined with EEG and transcranial Doppler ultrasound provides reliable immediate assessment and ongoing monitoring of CNS structures. 
Prognostic significance of computed tomography of the brain in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. We studied the prognostic value of computed tomography (CT) of the brain for neurologic morbidity in patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. On review of Mayo Clinic records for 1975 through 1985, we found 32 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 20 of whom had undergone CT of the brain during their hospitalization. Despite major neurologic symptoms and signs, normal CT findings were associated with complete neurologic recovery. Seventy percent of patients with normal results of CT of the brain recovered and had no neurologic deficits, whereas 80% of patients with CT abnormalities died or had permanent neurologic sequelae. A review of the literature supports these conclusions. Thus, we suggest that CT of the brain be done in any patient with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and neurologic deficits. Regardless of the severity of neurologic involvement, normal CT findings should encourage continued vigorous treatment of the patient because a normal scan supports the possibility of full clinical recovery. 
Alterations of ATP levels and of energy parameters in the blood of alcoholic and nonalcoholic patients with liver damage. Blood adenine nucleotides were determined in patients with alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases. They included patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH), alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC), non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis (NALC), and amoebic liver abscess (ALA) (28 patients). A decrease of 28% to 39% in blood ATP levels was observed among the patients with AH and the cirrhotic groups, respectively (p less than 0.05), whereas no significant changes in blood ATP levels were detected in the ALA group. Although total blood adenine nucleotides were significantly diminished in AH, ALC, and NALC groups, the AH patients retained their energy relationships within normal range. On the other hand, the cirrhotic groups, independently of their etiology, failed to maintain an adequate ATP/ADP ratio, energy charge, and phosphorylation potential in the blood, suggesting a decreased energy availability in their blood cells. Nevertheless, the mechanism involved in these effects remains to be elucidated, a failure of the damaged liver to supply purines to extra-hepatic tissues might be a major event altering the blood energy parameters. 
Cutaneous herpes simplex virus infections. Affecting millions of Americans each year, herpes simplex virus infections are among the most common human viral infections. Many clinical forms exist, depending on the site of infection and the patient's age and immune status. Clinical evaluation and laboratory studies help establish the diagnosis. Acyclovir is the drug most often used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, although newer agents, such as phosphonoformate trisodium, may be required for acyclovir-resistant infections. 
Facial nerve monitoring in acoustic tumor surgery. Anatomic and functional preservation of the facial nerve during acoustic tumor surgery remains a primary goal. Intraoperative electromyographic facial nerve monitoring with auditory feedback has enabled the surgeon to more readily achieve this goal. We compared a group of monitored translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removals (N = 89) to a similar unmonitored group (N = 155) in regard to facial nerve function. Function was assessed immediately postoperatively, at time of discharge, and at 1 year postoperatively using the House six-point scale. Results were grouped as satisfactory, intermediate, or poor and were analyzed by tumor size. Facial nerve results were better at all time intervals in the monitored groups, although the difference was not statistically significant at the 1-year interval. There was no difference between monitored and unmonitored patients in the subgroups with tumors smaller than 2.5 cm in diameter. This study supports the usefulness of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring in improving facial nerve results, particularly in larger tumors. 
Effects of media conditions, insulin, and dexamethasone on insulin-receptor mRNA and promoter activity in HepG2 cells. Numerous physiological agents and conditions modulate cellular insulin sensitivity by downregulating or upregulating total cellular insulin receptors. In this study, we examined the effects of replacing complete medium in the absence or presence of insulin on the regulation of insulin-receptor gene expression in cultured human hepatoma cells (HepG2). Failure to replace complete medium resulted in growth arrest of HepG2 cells and a six- to sevenfold increase in insulin-receptor mRNA due to the prolongation of insulin-receptor mRNA half-life. Northern analysis revealed multiple insulin-receptor mRNA species; the largest species (11 kilobases) was disproportionately increased in growth-arrested cells. High concentrations of insulin (500 ng/ml) induced a 33.8% decrease in the abundance of insulin-receptor mRNA (n = 14). At lower concentrations, a trend of inhibition was observed but was not statistically significant. Insulin (500 ng/ml) did not affect insulin-receptor mRNA stability. The effect of conditioned media, insulin, and dexamethasone on insulin-receptor promoter activity was also examined. Various constructs of the 5'-flanking region of the insulin-receptor gene were attached immediately upstream to a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene and transiently transfected into HepG2 cells via a pBR322-derived plasmid (pCAT). In cells replaced with complete medium, 12 and 118% of the promoter activity was contained within 578 and 877 base pairs, respectively, from the major translational initiation site. Conditioned media from growth-arrested cells in culture for 7 days increased promoter activity approximately twofold in 48 h. However, this increase failed to localize to any specific region on the insulin-receptor promoter. 
A prospective comparison of neuropsychologic performance of children surviving leukemia who received 18-Gy, 24-Gy, or no cranial irradiation. To compare the late neuropsychologic toxicities of CNS prophylaxis for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), longitudinal assessments were performed on three groups of patients: those who received repeated courses of moderate-dose (1 g/m2) intravenous (IV) and intrathecal methotrexate (IT MTX) without cranial irradiation (MTX group, n = 26), those who received IT MTX and 18 Gy cranial irradiation (18-Gy group, n = 23), and those who received IT MTX and 24 Gy cranial irradiation (24-Gy group, n = 28). All patients were free of CNS leukemia at diagnosis and had remained in continuous, complete remission 5 to 11 years (median, 7.4 years) following CNS prophylaxis. An analysis of serial intelligence quotient (IQ), achievement, and neuropsychologic studies revealed no significant influence of either age at CNS prophylaxis or CNS prophylaxis group on any neuropsychologic outcome measure. After adjusting for changes in IQ test versions that were necessitated by advancing patient age, no statistically significant declines in Verbal, Performance, or Full Scale IQs were noted for the three CNS treatment groups. However, comparisons of group means masked declines in individual children; 22% to 30% of children exhibited a clinically significant deterioration (greater than or equal to 15 points) in uncorrected IQ values over the study period. Female sex was associated with an increased risk of deterioration in Verbal IQ, but we were unable to identify risk factors associated with other declines in intellect and achievement. The inability to reliably predict individual patients at risk for clinically significant neuropsychologic toxicities on the basis of age at diagnosis or specific method of CNS prophylaxis suggests that other etiologic factors must be explored as the basis for these changes, such as ecologic factors and chemotherapy during the continuation phase of treatment. 
Resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder. A preliminary report of reconstruction with a new modular spacer. Reconstruction after resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder is difficult. Twelve patients had reconstruction using a new titanium modular spacer. This modular system allows the surgeon to reconstruct variable lengths of the proximal humerus. Although the patient has no active shoulder motion, excellent hand and elbow function is preserved. The spacer serves as a temporary device in the young active patient. A more definitive reconstructive procedure can be performed after the completion of chemotherapy and a sufficient disease-free interval. 
Clinical application of a patient-controlled apparatus for ventricular administration of morphine in intractable pain: report of 28 cases. The authors developed a patient-controlled apparatus (L-224) for ventricular administration of pain-relieving medication and utilized it in the treatment of 28 patients with intractable pain. The initial dose of morphine hydrochloride was 1 mg, which afforded pain relief for an average of 170 hours. At an average dose of 1.8 mg, the average time of pain relief obtained was 137 hours. Therefore, they conclude that L-224 is a satisfactory apparatus for the ventricular administration of pain medication; it is patient controlled, safe, and reliable in clinical application. 
Malignant transformation of an osteoblastoma of the skull: an exceptional occurrence. Case report. What is apparently the first reported case of spontaneous malignant transformation of a benign osteoblastoma of the skull is described. The initial lesion was completely removed surgically and showed the histological features typical of a benign osteoblastoma. No radiotherapy was performed. Eleven years later the patient developed an osteosarcoma of the skull. Review of the literature showed that malignant transformation of benign osteoblastomas is extremely rare and could take place spontaneously. However, the risk of this occurring seems higher after inadequate initial treatment (curettage or partial excision). Follow-up monitoring of patients with osteoblastoma of the cranial vault is suggested. 
Pulmonary function of preeclamptic women receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate seizure prophylaxis. Pulmonary function was studied in ten preeclamptic women in labor (mean gestational age 38.1 +/- 0.9 weeks measured from the last menstrual period) receiving continuous intravenous (IV) infusions of magnesium sulfate. Baseline maximal inspiratory pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, functional vital capacity, and forced expiratory volume at 1 second were measured immediately before a 6-g IV loading dose of magnesium sulfate and 2 hours after the initiation of a continuous 2-g/hour infusion of magnesium sulfate. Serum magnesium levels were measured at the same time pulmonary function tests were performed. All values are reported as the mean +/- standard deviation. The maximal inspiratory pressure, an indicator of generalized respiratory muscle weakness, decreased from a baseline value of 26.2 +/- 7.7 to 19.4 +/- 6.3 cm H2O (P less than .05). The maximal expiratory pressure, an indicator of expiratory muscle strength, decreased from a baseline value of 30.6 +/- 9.2 to 25.2 +/- 7.1 cm H2O (P less than .005). The functional vital capacity decreased from a baseline value of 3.37 +/- 0.49 to 3.19 +/- 0.73 L, and the forced expiratory volume at 1 second decreased from a baseline value of 2.61 +/- 0.58 to 2.36 +/- 0.68 L at 2 hours (P less than .05). The mean serum magnesium level was 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/dL before the administration of the IV loading dose and 4.51 +/- 0.67 mg/dL 2 hours after initiation of the continuous infusion. Our results demonstrate a significant decrease in pulmonary function tests in term preeclamptic patients receiving magnesium sulfate for seizure prophylaxis. 
Androgens and oligomenorrhea in hirsute women. A recent study demonstrated that hirsute women with irregular menses had higher levels of serum androgens that hirsute women with regular menses. To investigate this finding, we measured total testosterone, biologically active testosterone, free testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in 51 hirsute women with regular menses and compared the levels found to those found in 28 hirsute women with oligomenorrhea. There was no significant difference in the degree of facial hirsutism between the two groups. Oligomenorrheic women had significantly higher levels of free testosterone (p less than 0.02) and biologically active testosterone (p less than 0.05). The other androgens did not differ significantly between the two groups. The free fractions of testosterone are the metabolically active forms of the hormone and their levels are a function of the rates of production and clearance of testosterone that are elevated in states of hyperandrogenism. This study confirms that hirsute women with oligomenorrhea have higher levels of free and biologically active testosterone than those with regular menses. 
Concomitant medical disease and headache. The treatment of headache disorders in patients with concomitant medical illness constitutes one of the more challenging areas of headache therapy. As new agents are added to our pharmacologic armamentarium, it will become easier to tailor therapy to our patients. The physician who treats the headache patient with concomitant medical illness must be particularly aware of drug side effects and pharmacology in order to prevent a worsening of underlying medical conditions or an exacerbation of headaches. 
How prevalent is cancer family syndrome? Based on an established but pragmatic definition of cancer family syndrome as the presence of three or more relatives affected by colorectal cancer in a first degree kinship, the contribution of this syndrome to the total cancer burden in Northern Ireland has been studied by investigating all non-polyposis probands under 55 years old at histological diagnosis between 1976 and 1978. Family interviews were possible for 95% (n = 205) of all non-polyposis probands and verification of vital status or medical history was obtained for 98% of 1811 first degree relatives. The prevalence of cancer family syndrome was between 1 and 2%, a figure some fivefold less than that estimated elsewhere. A proximal tumour excess was not characteristic of the ascertained families. These results may have implications for the identification of susceptible people if screening for high risk groups is considered a worthwhile option for reducing colorectal cancer mortality in the United Kingdom. 
Small bowel obstruction after colon resection for benign and malignant diseases. To determine the etiology and outcome of patients with small bowel obstruction after a colon resection for benign and malignant diseases, the medical records of 118 patients who underwent 120 laparotomies for small bowel obstruction were reviewed. Contrary to previous reports, benign adhesions were responsible for the obstruction in all patients with a history of benign colon disease, 82.6 percent of patients with a history of adenocarcinoma of the colon without known recurrence, and 30.1 percent of patients with known recurrent malignancy. The morbidity and mortality was more related to the etiology of the obstruction rather than the preoperative delay or operative procedure performed. Considering the high likelihood of adhesive obstruction in patients with a history of, or known, metastatic colorectal carcinoma, it is suggested that these not deter surgeons from aggressive early surgical intervention in these patients who develop small bowel obstruction. 
Clinical experience with oral sumatriptan: a placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study. Oral Sumatriptan Dose-defining Study Group. A double-blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of 100, 200 and 300 mg sumatriptan, a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)1-like receptor agonist, given in an oral dispersible form in the acute treatment of migraine attacks. A total of 1130 patients were recruited from 51 centres in eight countries and the efficacy results are presented from an interim analysis of 538 cases. Tolerability was evaluated in 227 patients. At 2 h, an improvement in headache severity from moderate or severe to mild or none was reported by 67% of patients who received 100 mg sumatriptan, 75% receiving 200 mg and 69% of patients receiving 300 mg sumatriptan, compared with 22% of patients who received placebo (P less than 0.001 all doses sumatriptan vs placebo). Adverse events were generally mild and transient, and appeared to be dose-related; the adverse event profile of 100 mg sumatriptan was similar to that of placebo. Overall, nausea/vomiting and "bitter taste" were the most common complaints. The proportion of patients withdrawn due to adverse events was similar in the placebo and 100 mg sumatriptan treatment groups (2% and 3%, respectively). It is concluded that 100 mg sumatriptan given orally is well tolerated with an anti-migraine efficacy comparable to that provided by the two higher doses. 
Effect of sequential early burn wound excision and closure on postburn oxygen consumption. OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of early excision and closure of burns on postburn hypermetabolism, measured as oxygen consumption (VO2). METHODS: Twelve patients with deep burns of 30% to 50% of total body surface underwent sequential excisions and wound coverage, beginning 1 to 3 days after burn. The majority of the deep burn was removed by day 7, but with the addition of a donor site area of 20% to 25% of total body surface. RESULTS: No decrease in VO2 was noted in relation to the percent removal of burn tissue. In addition, a transient further increase in VO2 was noted early after excision, especially with surgical procedures performed after 5 days. This response could not be attributed to wound manipulation-induced bacteremias. CONCLUSION: We conclude that early surgical excision and closure of burns in excess of 30% to 50% of total body surface do not decrease postburn hypermetabolism in proportion to the area closed. It is possible that remaining open wounds in the form of donor sites and nonexcised burn are sufficient to perpetuate the hypermetabolic process, once established. 
Transanal electrostimulation for fecal incontinence: clinical, psychologic, and manometric prospective study. A prospective study was carried out to analyze the clinical, psychologic, and manometric short-term results of transanal electrostimulation (TES) in the treatment of fecal incontinence. Fifteen patients underwent TES. An initial clinical and manometric assessment was carried out before and 1 month after the procedure. A psychologic evaluation was also performed by means of interviews and appropriate tests. Early improvement of symptoms was noted in 10 patients. The nonresponders were women with gross daily incontinence to solid stool. At anal manometry, resting tone and rectal sensation remained unchanged, whereas a significant increase of voluntary contraction was observed following TES (from 48 +/- 26 to 59 +/- 39 mm Hg, P = 0.03). Psychologically, TES led to a significant decrease of both latent and paranoid anxiety related to symptoms (P = 0.02). At a clinical reassessment 6 months later, one of the nonresponders became continent after a further course of TES. In conclusion, TES is well accepted by the patients, is followed by positive emotional response, and, by improving striated sphincter function, seems to be effective in the treatment of partial fecal incontinence. 
Combination thrombolytic therapy: a comparison of simultaneous and sequential regimens of tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase. Coronary angioplasty following unsuccessful tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) therapy for acute myocardial infarction has been associated with a high incidence of subsequent reocclusion of the infarct-related artery, and a relatively high in-hospital mortality. In contrast, the combination of t-PA and urokinase, when given intravenously prior to coronary angiography, appears to be associated with a low incidence of post-rescue angioplasty reocclusion. In order to determine whether intraprocedural urokinase, given at the time of rescue coronary angioplasty for failed t-PA therapy, improves long-term patency of the infarct vessel to the same extent as preangiographic, combination t-PA/urokinase therapy, three thrombolytic treatment strategies were retrospectively compared. The first group included 86 patients undergoing rescue angioplasty after t-PA monotherapy (t-PA alone). The clinical and angiographic outcomes of these patients were compared with those of 24 patients who received intravenous or intracoronary urokinase during rescue angioplasty following unsuccessful t-PA therapy (sequential t-PA/urokinase therapy), and with those of 34 patients undergoing rescue coronary angioplasty following unsuccessful therapy with the combination of intravenous t-PA and urokinase (simultaneous therapy). There was no difference in postangioplasty patency rate of the infarct-related artery between the three groups. However, the sequential t-PA/urokinase regimen was associated with a subsequent reocclusion rate that was lower than the rate that occurred in the t-PA monotherapy group but higher than the rate in the simultaneous t-PA/urokinase group (13 versus 29 versus 2%, respectively; p = 0.003). 
Intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral infarction, and subdural hematoma after acute myocardial infarction and thrombolytic therapy in the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Study. Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II, pilot and clinical trial. In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction, Phase II pilot and clinical trial, 908 patients [326 (35.9%) in the pilot study and 582 (64.0%) in the randomized study] were treated with 150 mg recombinant tissue-type plasminogen (rt-PA) activator in combination with heparin and aspirin, and 3,016 patients [64 (2.1%) in the pilot study and 2,952 (97.9%) in the randomized study] were treated with 100 mg rt-PA in combination with heparin and aspirin. Adverse neurological events occurred in 23 patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (2.5%) [nine cerebral infarctions (1.0%), 12 intracerebral hemorrhages (1.3%), and two subdural hematomas (0.2%)] and in 33 patients treated with 100 mg rt-PA (1.1%) [20 cerebral infarctions (0.7%), 11 intracerebral hemorrhages (0.4%), and two subdural hematomas (0.1%)]. The difference in adverse neurological events observed comparing the two rt-PA regimens was primarily due to a higher frequency of intracerebral bleeding among patients treated with 150 mg rt-PA (1.3% versus 0.4%, p less than 0.01). Patients with recent (within 6 months) histories of stroke were not eligible for the study, and patients with any history of cerebrovascular disease were declared ineligible early in the study. The small number of patients (89, or 2.3%) with any history of neurological disease, intermittent cerebral ischemic attacks, or stroke who were enrolled before the stricter eligibility criteria were imposed or on the basis of incomplete baseline information experienced an increased frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage compared with patients without such histories (3.4% versus 0.5%). Mortality at 6 weeks after presentation among 23 patients who had intracerebral hemorrhage was 47.8%. Intracerebral hemorrhage is a severe but infrequent complication of rt-PA therapy for acute myocardial infarction. The combined frequency of intracerebral hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, and cerebral infarction after treatment with 100 mg rt-PA is comparable to that observed in other trials with thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial infarction. 
9p monosomy in a patient with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome. Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit disorder. Family studies support the presence of an autosomal dominant gene; however, to date, an assignment for the GTS locus has not been made. We present the case of a boy with GTS and a deletion of the terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 9, del(9)(qter----p2304:). 
A femoral vein-femoral artery loop technique for aortic dilatation in children. Balloon aortic dilatation is now a recognized therapy for aortic stenosis in children. Using retrograde approaches with either single or double balloons, successful dilatation can be readily achieved, but with little control of balloon position across the valve. We describe a femoral vein-femoral artery loop technique via a transseptal approach which facilitates antegrade crossing of the stenotic aortic valve and allows optimal balloon control and simultaneous pressure gradient recording during the procedure. 
Acceleration of chronic myeloid leukemia correlates with calcitonin gene hypermethylation. Calcitonin gene methylation at CCGG sites were determined in 39 chronic myeloid leukemia patients by isoschizomeric restriction endonuclease analysis. A total of 27 patients were analyzed while still in the chronic phase: 20 patients had a normal gene, and seven had a hypermethylated gene. There were 12 patients initially studied in accelerated or blastic phases. All but one patient showed gene hypermethylation, suggesting a good correlation between gene methylation and disease stage. All five patients who, while still in the chronic phase, had a major 3.1-kb hypermethylated calcitonin gene fragment, accelerated within 2 to 27 months. In consecutively analyzed patients, the initially normal calcitonin gene changed to a hypermethylated state as the disease escalated. The hypermethylation predicted disease acceleration with a median lead time of 6 months before any morphologic or clinical signs of disease progression were seen. The disease progressed in 8 of 27 patients initially studied in the chronic phase: in only two patients this occurred without predictive methylation changes. The results suggest that the assessment of calcitonin gene methylation status may be a promising tool for monitoring chronic myeloid leukemia disease escalation. 
Fibrinolysis in cerebrospinal fluid after intraventricular haemorrhage. Concentrations of cross linked fibrin degradation products were measured in the cerebrospinal fluid from five 'normal' preterm infants (median 102 ng/ml), four preterm infants with intraventricular haemorrhage (median 315 ng/ml), and five infants with progressive post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (median 1000 ng/ml). Serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid from one infant showed a peak concentration two weeks after the haemorrhage. 
Hydatidiform mole and fetus with normal karyotype: support of a separate entity. Repetitive hydatidiform mole was observed in four pregnancies. The pregnancies presented with heavy bleeding and vomiting, but the post-evacuation courses were uncomplicated, with rapid regression of serum hCG levels. Cytogenetic investigations, analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and flow cytometry in three pregnancies were consistent with diploid, biparental conception as the origin of fetal tissue and molar and nonmolar villi. In one pregnancy, the analyses of cytogenetic markers suggested the coexistence of two different cell lines of dizygotic, biparental origin, whereas DNA analysis was consistent with a single conception. With incomplete genetic information, a hydatidiform mole with coexistent normal fetus is generally considered to result from dizygous twinning comprising an androgenetic complete mole and a normal conception. In the present gestations, the results based on several techniques applied on numerous samples from different tissues render this possibility unlikely. Some of the contradictions between histologic and cytogenetic classifications of hydatidiform mole may be explained by diploid, biparental partial mole, which seems to constitute a separate subgroup within hydatidiform mole. Following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, continued pregnancy may be considered, depending on prenatal diagnosis including genetic marker analysis. 
A prospective study of outcome from protein-energy malnutrition in nursing home residents. To study recovery from protein-energy malnutrition in patients newly admitted to a chronic care facility, biochemical and anthropomorphic malnutrition indicators were measured prospectively over a 2-month period. Subjects were observed for a mean of 76 +/- 18 days after admission. Factors which might affect nutritional status including method of feeding, energy prescribed, use of supplemental feedings, assistance in eating, and amount of diet consumed were recorded. Confounding variables including illness, mental status, functional status, or prescription drugs were evaluated for their impact. On the basis of an empiric nutrition score, 54% of newly admitted residents were malnourished. Improvement in nutritional score occurred in 63% of malnourished patients remaining in the facility whereas 37% remained malnourished. Two related factors, percentage of diet consumed and degree of assistance required in eating, were important differences in the outcome of patients remaining malnourished. Interventional studies to determine whether outcome can be improved by more aggressive feeding methods or by feeding teams need to be undertaken. 
Human beta-galactosidase gene mutations in GM1-gangliosidosis: a common mutation among Japanese adult/chronic cases. Molecular analysis of the human beta-galactosidase gene revealed six different mutations in 10 of 11 Japanese GM1-gangliosidosis patients. They were the only abnormalities in each allele examined in this study. A 165-nucleotide duplication (positions 1103-1267) was found in two infantile patients, producing an abnormally large mRNA; one patient was probably a homozygote, and the other was a heterozygote of this mutation. The other two infantile patients had different mutations; a 123 Gly(GGG)----Arg(AGG) mutation in one patient and a 316 Tyr(TAT)----Cys(TGT) mutation in the other. A 201 Arg(CGC)----Cys(TGC) mutation, eliminating a BspMI site, was detected in a late-infantile/juvenile patient; the restriction-site analysis of amplified genomic DNA confirmed his heterozygosity for this mutation. A 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation was found in all five adult/chronic patients examined in this study. It created a SauI site, and restriction-site analysis confirmed that four patients were homozygous mutants. The other was a compound heterozygote for this mutation and another 457 Arg(CGA)----Gln(CAA) mutation. These mutant genes expressed markedly decreased or completely deficient enzyme activities in beta-galactosidase-deficient human fibroblasts transformed by adenovirus-SV40 recombinants. We conclude that gene mutations are heterogeneous in GM1-gangliosidosis but that the 51 Ile(ATC)----Thr(ACC) mutation is common among the Japanese adult/chronic cases. Genotype-phenotype correlations in GM1-gangliosidosis are briefly discussed. 
Lack of evidence for small vessel disease in a patient with "slow dye progression" in the coronary arteries. A patient with chest pain of recent onset, suggestive for angina pectoris, was referred for diagnostic coronary angiography, which showed the typical phenomenon of "slow dye progression" in the absence of any significant coronary artery stenosis. While intracoronary Doppler measurements confirmed the extremely slow blood flow velocity, the coronary flow reserve and the calculated coronary blood flow proved to be within normal range. The present findings suggest that, in contrast with a previous hypothesis, the phenomenon of slow dye progression may not always be due to a microvascular cause. Epicardial artery disease, as suggested by the marked coronary artery ectasia, may be linked to the slow dye progression and predispose to coronary artery thrombosis. 
Rotationplasty as a reconstructive operation after tumor resection. Reconstruction in the skeletally immature patient following resection of osteosarcoma about the knee is a challenging problem. Salvaging of the limb with allogeneic or prosthetic replacement results in a shortened limb with functional limitations. Arthrodesis yields a stiff and shortened limb. The so-called growing prosthesis has a high complication rate and is still unproven. However, rotationplasty has been successfully used as a reconstructive technique following resection of these types of tumors in the skeletally immature patient. A limb with normal sensation and proprioceptions, adequate range of motion, and without leg-length discrepancies, functional limitations, or painful neuroma is to be expected. Although a prosthesis must be worn, these patients are active and participate in unrestricted physical activity. Cosmetic acceptance has not been a problem and complications are minimal. Thus, rotationplasty requires only a single operation and results in a highly functional limb. 
Factors affecting the patency of stents in malignant biliary obstructive disease: univariate and multivariate analysis. To investigate the factors affecting the patency of biliary stents, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in 370 straight stents with diameters of 10- to 12-French gauge which had been inserted singly as palliative treatment in 228 patients with malignant biliary obstructive disease. In the analysis of 226 first stents, advanced age of patients and higher serum bilirubin levels before insertion were found to be significant unfavorable factors limiting the duration of stent function. Overall, older age, male sex, no stent cleaning, and insertion on three or more occasions were significant unfavorable prognostic factors for patency. The risk of occlusion for stents inserted on three or more occasions was 2.32 times that of the first stent insertion. The median duration of patency of first, second, and subsequent stents was 177, 98, and 97 days, respectively. Diagnosis and the area of stenosis were unrelated to patency. No predictive significance of length or size of stent between 10- and 12-French gauge was found in our study. 
Unusual clinical presentation of malignant histiocytosis in a 70-year-old woman. A 70-year-old woman was admitted for evaluation of hepatosplenomegaly, fever and elevated serum LDH levels. A biopsy specimen of the liver revealed histiocytic proliferation at the portal triad, and a mild degree of hepatitis. A bone marrow biopsy specimen showed proliferation of histiocytes with minimal immaturity and atypism, and haemophagocytosis by the proliferated histiocytes. Fever, hepatosplenomegaly and elevation of LDH levels all disappeared spontaneously, and presumptive diagnosis of benign reticulosis with haemophagocytosis was made. One year later, fever, hepatosplenomegaly and elevation of LDH levels redeveloped, and the liver and bone marrow biopsy specimen showed proliferation of unequivocally malignant histiocytes. The patient died as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation with shock 20 d later. We concluded that, in this case, malignant histiocytosis first presented as benign haemophagocytic reticulosis and, 1 year later, there was a typical malignant presentation. 
Management of bleeding liver tumours in Hong Kong. A retrospective study was undertaken of 41 patients diagnosed as having suffered spontaneous liver rupture over a 4-year period to identify the clinical features, treatment and outcome of this complication in an area in which hepatocellular carcinoma is endemic. Two patients were excluded with a revised diagnosis of haemorrhagic malignant ascites. Of the remaining 39 patients, 37 bled from ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma, one from peliosis hepatis and multiple liver cell adenomas, and one from a malignant hepatic epithelioid haemangioendothelioma. Analysis showed that 59 per cent of patients were in shock on admission and that all but two of the 37 patients with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma were men with cirrhosis. The association with cirrhosis was significantly higher than in a series of 45 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing elective resection during the same period (P less than 0.05). Treatment consisted of supportive care only in two patients, angiographic embolization in four, emergency liver resection in 11 of whom six died, hepatic artery ligation in 12 of whom eight died, and suture and/or packing in eight of whom six died. One patient died at laparotomy and in another patient bleeding was successfully arrested by intratumoural injection of absolute alcohol. Because of the high operative mortality of emergency surgery in these poor risk patients, prospective evaluation of emergency angiographic embolization is required. 
Impaired efficacy of selective LDL-apheresis in primary biliary cirrhosis. Low-density lipoprotein apheresis (LDL-apheresis) was done with either cascade filtration (DF) or dextran sulfate cellulose adsorption (DSC) in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis who developed severe dyslipidemia associated with cholestasis and accumulation of lipoprotein-X (LP-X). The extracorporeal treatment was initially performed weekly, and resulted in a sharp drop in total cholesterol from 1038 to 430 mg/dl. During the next four months the patient was treated every 10-15 days, and pre-apheresis cholesterol levels were maintained between 438 and 505 mg/dl, until an orthotopic liver transplantation was successfully performed. With semi-selective DF a mean 47.1% of total cholesterol was removed per procedure compared to 30.0% with DSC, although the volume of treated plasma was 38.0 vs 49.9 ml/kg body weight. The changes in plasma cholesterol levels during DSC and DF showed that the kinetics of cholesterol removal were similar with both techniques, but the efficacy differed; DF removed both LDL and LP-X from plasma, whereas DSC selectively lowered the LDL content. Cascade filtration may therefore be considered as a first-choice treatment for patients with LP-X accumulation due to cholestasis. 
Chronic hematocele complicating renal failure and hemodialysis. A patient with a recent history of genitourinary tuberculosis, chronic renal failure and hemodialysis presented with a slow growing scrotal swelling that had enlarged during the last 3 years. Physical examination and sonography were suspicious for testicular tumor, and surgical exploration and inguinal orchiectomy were performed. Ultimately the mass proved to be a chronic hematocele, a rare complication of uremic coagulopathy and hemodialysis. Because hematocele may clinically and sonographically resemble a testicular tumor, the proper management of a complex multiseptated scrotal mass without obvious history suggestive of hematocele is surgical exploration and orchiectomy. Awareness of this common presentation may obviate orchiectomy. 
Pulmonary intravascular lipid in neonatal necropsy specimens. The lungs of 482 liveborn infants were examined at necropsy for the presence of intravascular lipid. Forty one patients had received parenteral feeding (including lipid emulsion in 30), and 441 had died before starting feeds or had received enteral feeds alone. Tissue was processed into wax and then stained with Sudan black; intravascular lipid was found in 15 of 30 infants who had received intravenous fat (Intralipid), but in no others. Those patients with positive lipid staining had received significantly more fat during parenteral nutrition than those in whom intravascular lipid was not found but the two groups were otherwise clinically indistinguishable. Using this staining technique intravascular lipid can be shown relatively often, although only in patients who have received intravenous lipid emulsion. The location of fat, predominantly in small pulmonary capillaries, and the absence of lipid emboli in other organs, suggests that lipid coalescence takes place before death and is not a postmortem artefact. The clinical relevance remains uncertain. 
Current surgical technique to repair Fallot's tetralogy with absent pulmonary valve syndrome. The experience with surgical repair of Fallot's tetralogy and absent pulmonary valve syndrome is reviewed. Twenty-two patients aged 1 day to 8 years were treated between 1982 and 1989 using one surgical technique. This consisted of resection of the main pulmonary artery and large parts of the anterior wall of the right and left pulmonary artery. The ventricular septal defect was closed with a patch, and an aortic or pulmonary homograft (size, 8 to 24 mm) was interposed between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery. Two of the 8 infants operated on died; there was one late death. All 14 older children survived the operation. All survivors are well up to 7 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 3.6 years). We recommend early treatment of infants; older children can be treated electively. The technique used in our series gives excellent results. 
Pheochromocytoma in a long-term hemodialysis patient. A right adrenal tumor was found incidentally by renal echography in a 25-year-old man, who had been on hemodialysis for 4 years. Inquiry and clinical examination suggested pheochromocytoma, which was confirmed by plasma catecholamine measurements. Subsequent adrenalectomy was uneventful. Although hypertension, headache, and diaphoresis are common symptoms in a dialyzed patient, pheochromocytoma has to be eliminated in the presence of this clinical triad. 
Results of total cavopulmonary connection in the treatment of patients with a functional single ventricle. Total cavopulmonary connection was proposed as a modification of the Fontan procedure that might have greater benefits than previous methods. To assess this procedure we reviewed case histories of 38 patients (aged 17 months to 30 years) who underwent Fontan procedures with cavopulmonary anastomoses between January 1987 and December 1989. The group included 32 patients with univentricular heart, 2 with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum, 3 with tricuspid atresia, and 1 with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. One or more previous palliative procedures were performed in 34 patients, including 19 systemic-pulmonary shunts, 16 pulmonary artery bandings, 7 atrial septectomies/septostomies, 7 Glenn shunts, and 1 patent ductus arteriosus ligation. Preoperative hemodynamics showed a pulmonary artery pressure of 12 mm Hg (range 6 to 22 mm Hg), pulmonary-systemic flow ratio of 1.6 (range 0.37 to 3.0), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure 9 mm Hg (range 3 to 15 mm Hg), and systemic arterial oxygen saturation of 82% (range 67% to 94%). Concomitant with cavopulmonary connection, 13 patients underwent additional procedures, including 9 atrioventricular valve annuloplasties, 4 Damus-Stansel-Kaye procedures, and 2 resections of subaortic membranes. Modifying the Fontan procedure in this fashion was particularly useful in the management of 2 patients with pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum who had right ventricular-dependent coronary blood flow. Cavopulmonary anastomosis and atrial septectomy were performed in both patients, with resultant inflow of oxygenated blood to the right ventricle and coronary arteries. Excellent postoperative results were noted in each. Postextubation hemodynamics for the entire group included a mean right atrial pressure of 13 mm Hg (range 11 to 17 mm Hg), a mean left atrial pressure of 6 mm Hg (range 3 to 12 mm Hg), and a room air oxygen saturation of 96% (range 92% to 98%). Seven patients had pleural effusions, 3 required postoperative pacemaker placement, and 2 required reoperation for tamponade. A venous assist device was required in one patient on the second postoperative day, but the patient was weaned successfully within 24 hours. One early death (2.6%) occurred in a patient who had intractable ventricular fibrillation 2 days after operation. There was one late cardiac death (2.7%) caused by ventricular failure and one late noncardiac death. These results demonstrate that total cavopulmonary connection provides excellent early definitive treatment, with low morbidity and mortality, for a variety of complex congenital heart lesions. 
Evaluating South Carolina's community cardiovascular disease prevention project. A community cardiovascular disease prevention program was undertaken as a cooperative effort of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and the Centers for Disease Control of the Public Health Service. As part of the evaluation of the project, a large scale community health survey was conducted by the State and Federal agencies. The successful design and implementation of the survey, which included telephone and in-home interviews as well as clinical assessments of participants, is described. Interview response rates were adequate, although physical assessments were completed on only 61 percent of those interviewed. Households without telephones were difficult and costly to identify, and young adults were difficult to locate for survey participation. The survey produced baseline data for program planning and for measuring the success of ongoing intervention efforts. Survey data also have been used to estimate the prevalence of selected cardiovascular disease risk factors. 
Six-year experience with a comprehensive approach to the treatment of recurrent childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL-REZ BFM 85). A relapse study of the BFM group. Between April 1985 and March 1987 130 children and adolescents up to 18 years of age with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were registered on the stratified and randomized multicentric trial ALL-REZ BFM 85 designed for patients pretreated with intensive front-line therapies. Stratification criteria were time and site of relapse: bone marrow (BM) relapse on or up to 6 months after stopping front-line therapy (group A), BM relapse beyond 6 months after therapy (group B), and isolated extramedullary relapse at any time (group C). Treatment consisted of alternating courses of polychemotherapy including randomly administered high- or intermediate-dose methotrexate (HDMTX:12 g/m2 as 4-hour infusion; IDMTX: 1 g/m2 as 36-hour infusion). During maintenance therapy the patients received daily oral thioguanine and biweekly intravenous (IV) MTX. The overall second complete remission (CR) rate was 92% (groups A, B, and C: 88%, 92%, and 100%), and the probability of event-free survival (EFS) at 6 years is 0.31 +/- 0.04 (groups A, B, and C: 0.18 +/- 0.05, 0.30 +/- 0.07, and 0.72 +/- 0.11). HDMTX did not prove to be superior to IDMTX, which led to premature stopping of randomization. Risk factor analyses showed early relapse, particularly BM relapse within 18 months, and T-cell phenotype to be independent predictors of poor outcome. The incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapses following BM relapse was 19%, indicating that reprophylaxis to the CNS with IV/intrathecal (IT) MTX was insufficient. For 17 children who received bone marrow transplantation in second CR from HLA-compatible siblings the EFS was 0.53 +/- 0.12 at 5 years. Their outcome was not influenced by the above-mentioned risk factors. With the proposed treatment regimen long-lasting second remissions can be achieved in about one third of patients even after intensive front-line treatment. 
Expiratory muscle fatigue in normal subjects. We examined expiratory muscle fatigue during expiratory resistive loading in 11 normal subjects. Subjects breathed against expiratory resistances at their own breathing frequency and tidal volume until exhaustion or for 60 min. Respiratory muscle strength was assessed from both the maximum static expiratory and inspiratory mouth pressures (PEmax and PImax). At the lowest resistance, PEmax and PImax measured after completion of the expiratory loaded breathing were not different from control values. With higher resistance, both PEmax and PImax were decreased (P less than 0.05), and the decrease lasted for greater than or equal to 60 min. The electromyogram high-to-low frequency power ratio for the rectus abdominis muscle decreased progressively during loading (P less than 0.01), but the integrated EMG activity did not change during recovery. Transdiaphragmatic pressure during loading was increased 3.6-fold compared with control (P less than 0.05). These findings suggest that expiratory resistive loaded breathing induces muscle fatigue in both expiratory and inspiratory muscles. Fatigue of the expiratory muscles can be attributed directly to the high work load and that of the inspiratory muscles may be related to increased work due to shortened inspiratory time. 
Gliomatosis peritonei with malignant transformation: a case report and review of the literature. Gliomatosis peritonei is the implantation of glial tissue within the peritoneal cavity associated with ovarian teratomas. Previous reports have emphasized improved outcomes when these implants are found to be mature, even if the ovarian component is immature. A 16-year-old female with grade 3 immature teratoma was found on two subsequent laparotomies to have extensive peritoneal implantation of mature glial tissue. More than 5 years after the original surgery she was found to have a malignant abdominal glial neoplasm. This case illustrates a rare finding of malignant transformation of previously mature gliomatosis peritonei. 
Interferon-alpha overrides the deficient adhesion of chronic myeloid leukemia primitive progenitor cells to bone marrow stromal cells. Primitive blast colony-forming cells (BI-CFC) from chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients are defective in their attachment to bone marrow-derived stromal cells compared with normal BI-CFC. We investigated the effect of recombinant interferon-alpha 2a (IFN-alpha) on this interaction between hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells by culturing normal stromal cells with IFN-alpha (50 to 5,000 U/mL). At 50 U/mL we found that: (1) the capacity of stromal cells to bind two types of CML primitive progenitor cells (BI-CFC and long-term culture-initiating cells) was increased; and (2) the amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the stromal layer was increased. However, sulfated GAGs were not directly involved in binding CML BI-CFC, unlike binding by normal BI-CFC, which is sulfated GAG-dependent. Neuraminidase-treated control stromal cells bound an increased number of CML BI-CFC, reproducing the effect of IFN-alpha, whereas the binding to IFN-alpha-treated stromal cells was unaffected by neuraminidase treatment. Thus, the enhanced attachment by primitive CML progenitor cells to INF-alpha-treated stromal cells might be due to changes in the neuraminic acid composition in the stromal cell layer. Our in vitro evidence may provide insights into the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in vivo. Prolonged administration may alter the marrow microenvironment in some patients such that it can restrain the aberrant proliferation of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive stem cells while permitting Ph-negative stem cells to function normally. 
Plasma renin activity in renal transplant patients with hypertension. Chronic renal allograft rejection (CR) is the major cause of graft loss after 1 year following transplantation. Hypertension (HTN) and proteinuria (Up) are the hallmarks of this immunologic allograft response. Over 1 year, 23 patients posttransplantation and with HTN (diastolic greater than 95 mm Hg) were examined. Serial serum creatinine (Scr), Up, urine creatinine (Ucr), and resting and enalapril challenged (EC) plasma renin activity (PRA) were all determined. Renal artery stenosis was excluded by noninvasive imaging. Of the 23 patients, eight eventually lost their renal allografts, while 15 maintained satisfactory renal function (Scr less than 2.5). Results of this study show that: 1) worsening renal function (RF) increases EC reactivity; 2) the presence of proteinuria is not itself related to increase in EC activity; 3) renin before and after EC was higher (P = .06) in the allograft loss group. In this study, patients with high PRA represent the highest EC responses. Therefore, they display not macrovascular lesions, but microvascular intrarenal disease; this defect is most likely secondary to chronic immunologic insult. 
Diffuse uterine leiomyomatosis with hemorrhage. A 28-year-old woman with primary infertility and severe menorrhagia underwent a hysterectomy after failed hormonal therapy for multiple leiomyomas. The postoperative pathologic findings established the diagnosis of diffuse uterine leiomyomatosis, which demonstrated histologic, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural similarity to leiomyomas of the uterus. The rapid growth of the tumor coincided with the administration of clomiphene citrate, an estrogenic agonist. As with the common leiomyoma, intralesional hemorrhage in this case of diffuse leiomyomatosis was associated with norethindrone acetate treatment given after the cessation of clomiphene therapy. 
Myocardial infarction with minimal coronary atherosclerosis in the era of thrombolytic reperfusion. The Thrombolysis and Angioplasty in Myocardial Infarction (TAMI) Study Group. The incidence of minimal residual atherosclerotic coronary obstruction after successful intravenous thrombolytic therapy was evaluated in 799 patients with acute myocardial infarction. Minimal residual coronary obstruction (less than or equal to 50%) was observed on selective coronary angiography performed 90 min after initiation of thrombolytic therapy in 43 patients (5.5%). In 42 other patients (5.4%), a greater than 50% but less than 100% residual stenosis noted at 90 min demonstrated further resolution of obstruction to less than 50% at an angiographic follow-up study 7 to 10 days later. Patients with minimal residual coronary obstruction were significantly younger (52 +/- 10.7 versus 56.7 +/- 10 years; p = 0.002) and had less multivessel coronary disease (p less than 0.001), better initial left ventricular ejection fraction (54 +/- 12% versus 50.2 +/- 11.4%; p = 0.006) and a lower in-hospital mortality rate (1% versus 7%; p = 0.04) than did patients who had a significant (greater than 50%) residual coronary obstruction after intravenous thrombolysis. Long-term follow-up study of patients with a minimal coronary lesion (average 1.5 +/- 0.6 years) and those with significant residual stenosis (average 1.6 +/- 0.7 years) demonstrated that the incidence of death (2.4% in patients with minimal stenosis versus 3.5% in those with significant stenosis) and recurrent myocardial infarction (5% each) were similar in both groups. New strategies are needed to prevent coronary rethrombosis in patients with minimal atherosclerosis after thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction. 
Effectiveness of glibenclamide on myocardial ischemic ventricular arrhythmias in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Glibenclamide, a hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, is a blocker of the adenosine triphosphatase-modulated potassium ion channels. The opening of these channels in the myocardial cells, induced by acute myocardial hypoxia, can be responsible for ischemic ventricular arrhythmias. To evaluate the antiarrhythmic effects of this drug 19 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients were selected. They had coronary artery disease and evidence on Holter monitoring of ventricular premature complexes or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, induced by transient myocardial ischemia. In all patients, 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed to evaluate the number and duration of myocardial ischemic events, the frequency of ventricular premature complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia per minute of ischemia and the percentage of ventricular premature complexes versus total ischemic beats. Selected patients were classified in 2 groups: group A (9 patients) received metformin (placebo) and group B (10 patients) was treated with glibenclamide. On the fourteenth day patients underwent 24-hour control monitoring. Then a crossover between the 2 groups was made and a new Holter monitoring sequence was performed at the end of the second phase. Results indicate that glibenclamide significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced both the frequency of ventricular premature complexes and the episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during transient myocardial ischemia, but did not change the number and duration of acute myocardial ischemic attacks and did not reduce the spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. Thus, glibenclamide appears to have an antiarrhythmic effect in preventing ventricular arrhythmias induced by transient myocardial ischemia. 
AAEM minimonograph #11: Needle examination in clinical electromyography. The physiologic and histologic principles underlying clinical electromyographic studies are briefly reviewed as an introduction to the normal and abnormal findings in human subjects. Technical aspects of recordings as well as the specific types of discharges and their significance are discussed. 
Importance of chloride in the development of salt-induced angiotensin II hypertension in rats. This study attempted to evaluate the effect of anion associated with sodium loading on the development of angiotensin II (AII)-induced hypertension in rats. Hypertension was induced by intraperitoneal infusion of AII(125 ng/min) for 12 days via miniosmotic pump (systolic blood pressure on day 12, 143 +/- 3 mm Hg). High dietary intake of sodium chloride significantly augmented the AII-induced hypertension (systolic blood pressure on day 12, 166 +/- 4 mm Hg), but equimolar sodium loading provided as sodium citrate failed to enhance AII hypertension (systolic blood pressure on day 12, 136 +/- 8 mm Hg).
