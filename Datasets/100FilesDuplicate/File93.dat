Respiratory failure due to interstitial lung metastases of ovarian carcinoma reversed by chemotherapy. A woman with metastatic ovarian carcinoma developed postoperative respiratory failure due to interstitial lung metastases demonstrated by bronchoalveolar lavage. After chemotherapy, she was able to be removed from mechanical ventilation and has shown progressive resolution of her interstitial lung disease. Metastatic ovarian carcinoma can be a treatable etiology of life-threatening interstitial lung disease. 
Sclerotherapy for multiple glomangiomata. Multiple glomangiomata have always been treated by surgical resection. However, sclerotherapy can be used obliterate the majority of these tumors. 
Polycystic ovarian disease: contribution of vaginal endosonography and reassessment of ultrasonic diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the superiority of vaginal ultrasonography (US) on the abdominal US for the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD). DESIGN: The US pattern of ovaries was prospectively investigated by abdominal US and, whenever possible, by vaginal US. SETTING: Primary care, institutional. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-four women in whom PCOD was suspected on endocrine grounds and 62 other patients presenting with primary hyperprolactinemia (n = 23) or hypothalamic anovulation (n = 39). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Vaginal US allowed a better analysis of the ovarian stroma. RESULTS: The external ovarian features of PCOD were observed by both routes in less than one third of the 144 patients with PCOD. The internal ovarian features of PCOD were much more frequently observed by vaginal US than by abdominal US (polycystic pattern: 66.7% versus 38.1%, P less than 0.05; increased ovarian stroma: 57.1% versus 4.8%, P less than 0.001). In the 62 patients without PCOD, US features of PCOD were observed in less than 10% of them, except for the uterine width/ovarian length ratio less than 1 and the polycystic pattern (abdominal US: 17% and 34%; vaginal US: 11% and 50%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: An increased ovarian stroma seems to be the most sensitive and specific US sign of PCOD, providing that it can be investigated by vaginal US. 
Dental chair apoplexy. We have reported two cases of intracranial bleeding shortly after a dental procedure. We argue that administration of hypochlorite in gum debridement, application of dental cement, or mechanical stimulation of the alveolar branches of the trigeminal nerve at the pulp may not only result in acute systemic hypertension, but also in the release of vasodilatory neurotransmitters. The combination of a local increase in intracerebral blood flow and simultaneously developing systemic hypertension in an occasional patient may lead to intracranial hemorrhage. 
Portal-systemic encephalopathy: presence of basal ganglia lesions with high signal intensity on MR images. Sixteen patients with cirrhosis of the liver underwent cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transarterial portography to evaluate the relationship between basal ganglia lesions and portal-systemic collateral vessels. No neuropsychiatric disturbance was observed in any of the patients at the time of the MR examination, but four patients with portal-systemic encephalopathy were included in the study. Basal ganglia lesions, characterized by increased signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images, were observed in nine of the 16 patients, including the four with portal-systemic encephalopathy. These nine patients had large portal-systemic collateral vessels that were more than 10 mm in diameter. These collateral vessels were receiving blood from the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) in all nine patients. The lesions involved the globus pallidus and portions of internal capsules in a bilateral and symmetric fashion and did not exhibit mass effect. The authors conclude that there may be a significant relationship between high-intensity basal ganglia lesions and large portal-systemic collateral vessels receiving blood from the SMV. 
A donor splice mutation and a single-base deletion produce two carboxyl-terminal variants of human serum albumin. At least 35 allelic variants of human serum albumin have been sequenced at the protein level. All except two COOH-terminal variants, Catania and Venezia, are readily explainable as single-point substitutions. The two chain-termination variants are clustered in certain locations in Italy and are found in numerous unrelated individuals. In order to correlate the protein change in these variants with the corresponding DNA mutation, the two variant albumin genes have been cloned, sequenced, and compared to normal albumin genomic DNA. In the Catania variant, a single base deletion and subsequent frameshift leads to a shortened and altered COOH terminus. Albumin Venezia is caused by a mutation that alters the first consensus nucleotide of the 5' donor splice junction of intron 14 and the 3' end of exon 14, which is shortened from 68 to 43 base pairs. This change leads to an exon skipping event resulting in direct splicing of exon 13 to exon 15. The predicted Venezia albumin product has a truncated amino acid sequence (580 residues instead of 585), and the COOH-terminal sequence is altered after Glu-571. The variant COOH terminus ends with the dibasic sequence Arg-Lys that is apparently removed through stepwise cleavage by serum carboxypeptidase B to yield several forms of circulating albumin. 
Routine histological compared with immunohistological examination of bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens in disseminated neuroblastoma. The ability to detect infiltration in bone marrow biopsy specimens from patients with disseminated neuroblastoma was assessed by immunohistological and routine histological methods. Frozen cores from 33 staging procedures were tested with UJ13A and UJ127.11. Immunopositive tumour cells were found in 10 of 17 staging procedures in which tumour was detectable by routine histological methods. Positive cells or stromal material were also found in eight of 12 staging procedures in which distorted architecture and fibrosis, but no obvious tumour, had been noted. Paraffin wax embedded cores from 29 of the same staging procedures were tested with antibodies against neurone specific enolase and neurofilament. Only a single core reacted with anti-neurofilament antibody. Neurone specific enolase positive cells or stromal material were found in nine of 15 staging procedures in which obvious tumour was detectable. Although these immunohistochemical techniques proved inferior to routine histology in their ability to detect obvious tumour, the demonstration of immunopositive stromal tissue which was not frankly malignant supports the view that distorted, fibrotic marrow may reflect persistence of neuroectodermal tissue and justifies its distinction from normal marrow when reporting the response to treatment. 
Clinical, radiographic, and histologic study of endodontic treatment failures. One hundred fifty cases of endodontic treatment failures were studied clinically, radiographically, and histologically. Fifty-seven percent of the teeth were asymptomatic. Pain alone and/or associated with swelling was present in 21% of the teeth. There was no correlation between the size of periradicular rarefaction and the occurrence or severity of clinical signs and/or symptoms. Stainable bacteria were demonstrated in 69% of the teeth and were present mostly in the canal. The severity of periradicular inflammation was related to presence of stainable bacteria in the canal. Swelling and pain or a draining sinus tract was often associated with stainable bacteria inside the canal. The development of a radicular cyst associated with an endodontically treated tooth that has failed is not necessarily the cause of endodontic treatment failure. 
The prognostic significance of postoperative residual tumor in ependymoma. Between 1970 and 1989, 29 patients with intracranial ependymomas were evaluated and treated at the Children's Hospital in Boston. With a median follow-up of 82 months, the actuarial survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 61 +/- 10% and 46 +/- 12%, respectively. Anaplastic histological findings were uncommon (2 of 29). Initial postoperative radiotherapy was given to 25 patients, with a median tumor dose of 5360 cGy. With a median time to recurrence of 22 months, local failure (within 2 cm of original enhancing mass) was the predominant pattern of relapse (15 of 16 failures). The presence of radiographic residual disease seen on postoperative magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic scans was the most important prognostic variable for patients with intracranial ependymoma. Analysis of the 19 patients who underwent postoperative imaging revealed a 75 +/- 15% 5-year freedom from progressive disease for 9 patients with no residual disease, as compared with 0% freedom from progressive disease for the 10 patients with gross residual disease (P = 0.03). In contrast, the surgical assessment of residual disease was not significant (P = 0.4). Age at presentation was also a significant prognostic factor. The overall actuarial survival rate at 12 years for infants 24 months or younger at diagnosis was 0%, as compared with 62 +/- 13% for older patients (P = 0.03). For non-anaplastic ependymomas, complete surgical resection followed by local-field, high-dose (greater than 54 Gy) radiotherapy appears to offer the greatest chance for long-term survival. Because of the markedly reduced survival rate for patients with radiologically apparent postoperative disease, maximal surgical resection and novel therapeutic endeavors appear warranted for this high-risk group. Future protocols should use postoperative imaging, not operative reports, to stratify patients with ependymoma. 
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation of apparently stillborn infants: survival and long-term outcome. To determine the outcome of apparently stillborn infants who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation, we studied the short- and long-term outcome of 93 infants who had an Apgar score of 0 at 1 minute of age and were resuscitated at birth. Sixty-two (66.6%) responded and left the delivery room alive; 26 (42%) of the 62 infants died in the neonatal period and 36 infants were discharged home; of the 36 infants, three subsequently died during infancy. Of the 33 survivors, ten were lost to follow-up after discharge. Developmental assessment of 23 of 33 long-term survivors revealed normal outcome in 14 (61.7%), abnormal results in 6 (26%), and suspect status in 3 (13%). Fifty-eight infants had an Apgar score of 0 at greater than or equal to 10 minutes of age and all except one died; the surviving infant has an abnormal developmental outcome. We conclude that 39% of apparently stillborn infants who were resuscitated survived beyond the neonatal period and that 61% of the 23 survivors who were available for developmental follow-up had normal development at the time of last examination. Survival was unlikely if there was no response after 10 minutes of resuscitation. 
Blood transfusion and oxygen consumption in surgical sepsis. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the use of serum lactic acid values to predict flow-dependent increases in oxygen consumption (VO2) in response to increasing oxygen delivery (DO2) after blood transfusion in surgical sepsis. DESIGN: Prospective study. SETTING: Tertiary care, trauma center. PATIENTS: Twenty-one patients, postsurgical or posttrauma, judged septic by defined criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Serum lactic acid concentrations, DO2, and VO2 were measured before and after transfusion therapy. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Overall, the DO2 increased from 532 +/- 146 to 634 +/- 225 (SD) mL/min.m2 (p less than .001), and the VO2 increased from 145 +/- 39 to 160 +/- 56 mL/min.m2 (p = .02). These changes occurred with an Hgb increase from 9.3 +/- 1.1 to 10.7 +/- 1.5 g/dL (p less than .001). The patients were grouped by their pretransfusion serum lactic acid values. In those patients with normal (less than 1.6 mmol/dL) serum lactic acid (n = 10), DO2 increased from 560 +/- 113 to 676 +/- 178 mL/min.m2 (p less than .02), and VO2 increased from 150 +/- 25 to 183 +/- 46 mL/min.m2 (p less than .02). However, in the increased serum lactic acid group (n = 17), VO2 was not significantly changed after transfusion (143 +/- 46 to 146 +/- 58 mL/min.m2) despite increased DO2 (515 +/- 163 to 609 +/- 251 mL/min.m2, p less than .01). CONCLUSIONS: Blood transfusion can be used to augment DO2 and VO2 in septic surgical patients. Increased serum lactic acid values do not predict patients who will respond. The absence of lactic acidosis should not be used in this patient population to justify withholding blood transfusions to improve flow-dependent VO2. Patients who have increased lactate concentrations may have a peripheral oxygen utilization defect that prevents improvement in VO2 with increasing DO2. 
Prophylactic minitracheotomy in lung resections. A randomized controlled study. Thirty consecutive patients undergoing lung resections were randomized into two groups: Group A (n = 15) received minitracheotomy postoperatively and group B (n = 15) were control patients. Postoperative respiratory course was monitored by serial clinical assessments, chest x-ray examination, arterial blood gases, sputa bacterial cultures, and the patient's requirement and response to chest physiotherpy. The two groups were similarly matched in age (mean 58.5 years), smoking habits, pulmonary functions, and surgical procedures. Postoperative pulmonary complications of collapse/consolidation developed in 11 patients (two in group A and nine in group B) (p less than 0.03). Four patients (all in group B) required nimitracheotomy in addition to antibiotics and chest physiotherapy to treat their pneumonia. Chest physiotherapy requirement was less in group A than in group B, with a mean number of sessions of seven in group A and eight in group B and a mean total time of 92 minutes in group A and 112 minutes in group B. The mean duration of minitracheotomy was 4.13 days. Minor temporary symptoms resulted from the minitracheotomy in eight patients (42%) and included discomfort, voice changes, subcutaneous emphysema, and stridor. There was one case of long-term morbidity (5%)-skin scarring from wound infection at the site of the minitracheotomy. No postoperative deaths resulted. We conclude that the prophylactic use of minitracheotomy is safe and effective in decreasing postoperative respiratory complications in patients undergoing lung resections. 
Prevalence of chronic migraine headaches--United States, 1980-1989. Migraine headaches, which are characterized by painful, disabling, and recurring symptoms, have no known cause, treatment, or cure. Quality population-based data are needed to improve epidemiologic understanding of chronic migraine headaches. This report uses data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) to describe the prevalence of recent trends in the occurrence of chronic migraine headaches in the United States from 1980 through 1989. 
Regulation of cerebral blood vessels by humoral and endothelium-dependent mechanisms. Update on humoral regulation of vascular tone. Recent studies suggest that humoral and endothelium-dependent mechanisms may play an important role in the cerebral circulation. Angiotensin may acutely and chronically increase resistance of large cerebral arteries and reduce cerebral microvascular pressure without changing cerebral blood flow. We hypothesize that the brain may sense reductions in microvascular pressure and initiate compensatory neurohumoral responses to raise arterial pressure. Vasopressin appears to play an important role in regulation of production of cerebrospinal fluid and brain fluid volume. Vasopressin also may be protective when intracranial pressure is elevated. Endothelium-dependent mechanisms also may have important influences on tone of cerebral vessels. Synthesis of the endothelium-derived relaxing factor nitric oxide, or a nitric oxide-containing compound, appears to influence both basal tone and responses of large cerebral arteries to acetylcholine in vivo. Large cerebral arteries dilate in response to increased blood flow in vivo, and this response may be mediated in part by release of a humoral factor by endothelium. Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles to receptor- and nonreceptor-mediated agonists are impaired during chronic hypertension. The mechanism of impairment of endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral arterioles appears to involve production of an endothelium-derived contracting factor. 
Hyperinsulinemia, sex, and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease BACKGROUND. The possibility that hyperinsulinemia may be involved in the etiology of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) was first suggested 20 years ago. During the last decade, this possibility has received support from three large prospective studies. METHODS AND RESULTS. In the present study, the association between CVD, glucose intolerance, obesity, and hypertension (the GOH conditions) and hyperinsulinemia was examined cross-sectionally in a representative sample (n = 1,263) of the adult Jewish population aged 40-70 years in Israel. Previously known diabetics were excluded. CVD comprising clinical or ECG evidence of ischemic heart disease, as well as clinical evidence of cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular disease, was identified in 97 men and 39 women. A significant (p less than 0.01) hyperinsulinemia-sex interaction was found for CVD rate, with the adjusted risk ratios (followed by 95% confidence limits), relative to the rate in 298 normoinsulinemic women, being 1.15 (0.68-1.95) in 328 normoinsulinemic men, 0.85 (0.48-1.49) in 277 hyperinsulinemic women, and 2.27 (1.33-3.08) in 360 hyperinsulinemic men. Age-adjusted CVD rates in men versus women were: a) similar and low among all normoinsulinemic normotensives and hyperinsulinemics free of any of the GOH conditions (all rates less than or equal to 6.5%); b) similar and high among normoinsulinemic hypertensives (13.4% versus 10.4%); c) significantly higher in men among hyperinsulinemic normotensives with glucose intolerance and/or obesity (15.2% versus 3.3%; p = 0.02) and all hyperinsulinemic hypertensives (21.5% versus 12.8%; p = 0.04). These trends remained significant after adjusting for age, ethnic group, and blood lipids. CONCLUSIONS. Therefore, hyperinsulinemia was associated with excess CVD risk in men but not in women, and all excess CVD risk in men was confined to hyperinsulinemic individuals in the presence of glucose intolerance, obesity, or hypertension. 
Increased treatment of hypertension does not explain the decline in stroke mortality in the United States, 1970-1980. The steady decline in mortality from stroke in the United States accelerated markedly in the 1970s. It has been widely assumed that an increase in the rate of treatment of hypertension is the most likely explanation for this major public health achievement. An analysis of available information, however, suggests that improvements in the community control of hypertension in the United States in the period 1970-1980 have contributed in only a minor way. There were 45,357 fewer deaths from stroke in 1980 among those aged 35-74 years than might have been expected if the death rates had stayed the same as in 1970. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Surveys indicate that six million more people received antihypertensive medication in 1980 than in 1970. Results from a pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials of the treatment of hypertension suggest that between 6% and 16% of the reduction in stroke mortality was due to the increased treatment of hypertension. Epidemiological observations indicate that between 16% and 25% of the overall decline in stroke mortality can be attributed to the treatment of hypertension, suggesting that clinical trials probably underestimate the community-wide benefits of treatment. These results also suggest that at least three quarters of the decline in stroke mortality in the United States in the period 1970-1980 is due to factors other than antihypertensive treatment. 
Radial artery hypoplasia: a further association with the VATER syndrome? A case of radial artery hypoplasia in a girl with the VATER syndrome is reported. This finding should alert surgeons dealing with vascular access for dialysis and suggests the possibility of intrauterine ischemia in the etiology of upper limb anomalies in these patients. 
Donor limb vascular events following femoro-femoral bypass surgery. A Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study. Three hundred seventeen patients who had femorofemoral bypass surgery were examined for postoperative vascular changes that developed in the donor limb. "Unmasked" claudication developed in 7%, new claudication related to a "steal" developed in 3.5%, progression of preoperative claudication developed in 1%, new rest pain developed in 1.7%, and new necrosis developed in 0.7% of patients. Postoperatively, the donor limb ankle-brachial index decreased 0.30 or greater in 3% of the patients, decreased 0.15 to 0.29 in 6%, and decreased 0.10 to 0.14 in 6% of the patients. Only eight patients (3%) had a clinical and hemodynamic steal. Late vascular procedures for donor iliac stenosis were few, resulting in an iliac percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3% and inflow bypasses in 3%. Angiographic patterns of donor and recipient limbs were not predictive of "clinical" or "hemodynamic" steal events. Most new donor limb symptoms of claudication were an unmasking of arterial insufficiency previously present in the donor limb that became apparent when the recipient limb was improved. 
Possible roles of basic fibroblast growth factor in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease: an immunohistochemical study. Prominent features of moyamoya disease are fibrocellular thickening of the intima and enhanced angiogenesis. The pathogenesis of moyamoya disease is, however, unknown. Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is an angiogenic factor as well as a potent mitogen for a number of cell types including vascular endothelial and smooth-muscle cells. In order to test the possibility that basic FGF takes part in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease, the authors tested for the presence of this factor using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human recombinant basic FGF. The surgical specimens studied included two sections of the superficial temporal artery (STA) and four samples of dura mater from four patients with moyamoya disease. Surgical specimens were obtained from three patients with other diseases as control tissue. Sections of the STA obtained from the patients with moyamoya disease showed strong basic FGF immunoreactivity in endothelial and smooth-muscle cells, while control sections had only faint and scattered immunoreactivity. All sections of the dura mater obtained from the patients with moyamoya disease also revealed more intense immunohistochemical staining of basic FGF in meningeal and vascular cells than did control sections. These observations indicate that the amount of basic FGF is increased in the tissues of patients with moyamoya disease; thus, basic FGF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease. 
Experimental non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced enteropathy in the rat: similarities to inflammatory bowel disease and effect of thromboxane synthetase inhibitors. We have validated an established animal model of acute inflammatory bowel disease in indomethacin-treated rats. Studies in both in vitro and in vivo 51chromium-labelled ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (51Cr-EDTA) permeability and tissue myeloperoxidase activity, a marker of inflammatory cell invasion, showed increased permeability and enzyme levels, respectively, in treated animals compared to controls (in vitro 51Cr-EDTA permeability: (mean (SE] control 0.10 (0.02) microliter/mg per tissue, experimental 0.17 (0.02) (p less than 0.01, 2 way analysis of variance); in vivo 51Cr-EDTA permeability: control 3.9 (1.3) (% dose recovered), experimental 12.1 (1.5) (p less than 0.01); tissue myeloperoxidase: control 10.8 (0.4) mU/mg, experimental 17.2 (0.5) p less than 0.01). Pretreatment or simultaneous treatment of indomethacin-treated animals with glucocorticoids, sulphasalazine, or tetracycline reduced the permeability changes and the tissue inflammatory response (in vitro 51Cr-EDTA permeability: (mean (SE] sulphasalazine + indomethacin 0.11 (0.2) microliter/mg tissue (p less than 0.01), prednisolone +/- indomethacin 0.12 (0.02) (p less than 0.01), tetracycline + indomethacin 0.12 (0.02) (p less than 0.01]. Glucocorticoids and sulphasalazine, but not tetracycline, administered after the indomethacin also partially corrected the permeability and inflammatory changes induced by indomethacin (in vitro 51Cr-EDTA permeability: sulphasalazine 0.15 (0.02) microliter/mg, p less than 0.02; prednisolone 0.12 (0.02) microliter/mg, p less than 0.01). This approach was used to investigate the effects of two different thromboxane synthetase inhibitors in indomethacin-treated animals. Simultaneous treatment with thromboxane synthetase inhibitors and indomethacin prevented the 51Cr-EDTA permeability and tissue myeloperoxidase increases induced by indomethacin alone (in vitro 51Cr-EDTA permeability: thromboxane synthetase inhibitors + indomethacin 0.11 (0.01) microliter/mg (p0.01); tissue myeloperoxidase: 11 (0.4) mU/mg, (p less than 0.01). 
Risk factors for bilateral testicular germ cell tumors. Does heredity play a role? Twenty-three bilateral testicular germ cell tumors (four synchronous and 19 sequential tumors) were investigated for potential risk factors. The incidence of maldescensus testis was not found to be higher than in patients with unilateral disease. The histologic findings of the first tumor did not have any effect on the incidence of the second tumor. In 21 patients (four synchronous and 17 sequential tumors), histocompatibility antigens (HLA) were determined; HLA-B14 was increased significantly in the sequential tumor group. Tendencies toward an increase of HLA-DR5 and HLA-DR7 also were found. The HLA-DR1, HLA-DR3, and HLA-DR4 showed a tendency toward a decreased frequency. Therefore genetic factors might be important in the development of sequential bilateral testicular cancers. 
Expression of platelet-derived growth factor and transforming growth factor and their correlation with cellular morphology in glial tumors. This study was undertaken to evaluate the role of two sets of growth factors, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), in the induction and maintenance of glial tumors and their phenotypic expression. Explants from eight malignant tumors, five benign tumors, and two nontumor glial cells were analyzed for levels of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression of PDGFA, PDGFB, TGF-beta 1, and TGF-beta 2. Results were normalized to the mRNA expression of tubulin, a "housekeeping" gene present in glial cells. Of the 15 explants tested, PDGFB was seen in six, all of which were malignant tumors; PDGFA was seen in all 15 with much higher levels expressed in malignant tumors; and TGF-beta 1 and TGF-beta 2 were seen in all 15 without a clear difference between cell types, although expression tended to be higher in malignant tumors. This project supports the theory that the induction and maintenance of glial tumors is likely to be a multifactorial phenomenon. 
The risk of ligation of the left renal vein in resection of the abdominal aortic aneurysm. The left renal vein can be ligated during aortic operation to attain better access to the perirenal aorta. This maneuver has been considered safe, with a low incidence of postoperative renal complications. This study was done to evaluate the risk of left renal vein ligation and its influence on renal function in patients with elective resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The records of 332 patients undergoing elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms during a five year period were reviewed. The clinical and operative data of patients who had left renal vein ligation and those who did not were similar. Left renal vein ligation was not associated with an increased mortality rate but was strongly associated with an increase in serum creatinine level and a clinical diagnosis of postoperative azotemia. Nine of 13 patients who had left renal vein ligation had postoperative azotemia compared with 21 of 319 patients without left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.001). The mean change of preoperative and postoperative creatinine value was an increase of 1.92 milligrams per deciliter in patients with left renal vein ligation in contrast with 0.26 milligram per deciliter in patients without ligation (p less than 0.00075). Thus, ligation of the left renal vein increases the risk of postoperative renal complications and its use should be selective. 
Choriocarcinoma of the septum pellucidum: case report. A case of choriocarcinoma of the septum pellucidum is presented. The patient, a 6-year-old boy, demonstrated high levels of human chorionic gonadotropin in his urine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, and precocious puberty. The physical conditions and laboratory data returned to normal after surgical removal of the tumor, whole brain irradiation, and chemotherapy. Currently, there is no evidence of recurrence at 5 months after surgery. 
The combined antiischemic effects of the thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 30,741 and tissue-type plasminogen activator. The thromboxane-receptor antagonist, SQ 30,741, may be used as adjuvant therapy for thrombolysis and has also been shown to have antiischemic activity that is independent of its thrombolytic activity. Since tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) and SQ 30,741 may be administered simultaneously, we determined whether the antiischemic effects of SQ 30,741 can be potentiated by t-PA. This was accomplished by combining doses of t-PA and SQ 30,741, which alone were not cardioprotective. Anesthetized dogs were subjected to left circumflex coronary artery occlusion for 90 minutes and reperfusion for 5 hours. The dogs were treated during reperfusion with a dose of t-PA that caused approximately a 30% reduction in plasma fibrinogen alone or in combination with 1.5 mg/kg + 0.4 mg/kg/hr SQ 30,741, which started 10 minutes after initiation of ischemia. At these doses, neither t-PA nor SQ 30,741 alone significantly reduced infarct size (57% +/- 6%, 50% +/- 10%, 57% +/- 6% of the left ventricular area at risk for vehicle controls, t-PA, and SQ 30,741 respectively); however, combination treatment resulted in a significant reduction in infarct size (37% +/- 5% of the left ventricular area at risk). Higher doses of t-PA and SQ 30,741 alone significantly reduced infarct size. The protective effects of t-PA and SQ 30,741 occurred without altering peripheral hemodynamic status. No differences in collateral or reperfusion blood flow were observed between groups. Thus although SQ 30,741 may act to improve the efficacy of thrombolysis, t-PA may in turn enhance the antiischemic activity of SQ 30,741 or at least reduce the threshold dose. 
Measurement of tissue oxygen tension: comparison between two subcutaneous oxygen tonometers. We compared the 95% response time (95% RT) of two tissue oxygen tonometers under two sets of circumstances. We first evaluated the devices during normoxia, hyperoxia, and anoxia in vitro, using a transcutaneous PO2 electrode (PtcO2) as the reference. The responses to normoxia and to different grades of hyperoxia were examined in vivo in 8 healthy volunteers to assess the relationship between changes in subcutaneous PO2 and PtcO2, an estimate of arterial PO2 (PaO2). One subcutaneous method (ScA) used a technique based on a polarographic needle electrode in situ connected to an ammeter; the second method (ScB) was based on a blood gas analyzer system first described by Hunt (Lancet 164;2:1370). ScA and PtcO2 both responded to stepwise changes in ambient oxygen concentration (21-100%) in vitro within 10 seconds; the 95% RT of ScA was 1.39 +/- 0.5 to 2.39 +/- 0.8 minutes and that of PtcO2 was 0.32 +/- 0.1 to 0.49 +/- 0.1 minutes. ScB had a lag of 3 minutes, and the 95% RT was 6.75 +/- 0.5 to 8.2 +/- 0.8 minutes. In contrast to the results in vitro, the response of ScA to changes in FiO2 in vivo was delayed compared with the rapid response of PtcO2, reflecting the physiologic delay of tissue PO2 in response to increased PaO2. The time lag and the long 95% RT of ScB were even more evident in vivo. ScA reacted three to four times faster than ScB, both in vitro and in vivo, to changes in the oxygen environment. The in vitro 95% RT of ScA to changes in ambient oxygen varied from 2 to 3.5 minutes. 
Effects of acute insulin-induced hypoglycaemia on haemostasis, fibrinolysis and haemorheology in insulin-dependent diabetic patients and control subjects. 1. The effects of acute hypoglycaemia on haemostasis, fibrinolysis, blood viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation were examined after acute insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in six normal male subjects and in six male patients with poorly controlled insulin-dependent diabetes. In the control subjects hypoglycaemia caused a significant increase in the concentration of von Willebrand factor, with no change in the concentrations of fibrinogen and cross-linked fibrin degradation products. Fibrinolysis was enhanced, as indicated by significant increases in tissue plasminogen activator concentration and the fibrin plate lysis area, with a fall in plasminogen-activator inhibitor activity, suggesting complex formation. Whole-blood and plasma viscosity increased significantly after hypoglycaemia, but there was no significant change in erythrocyte aggregation tendency. 2. In diabetic patients the increase in the concentration of von Willebrand factor was significantly greater than in the control group (analysis of variance, P less than 0.02). The basal concentration of tissue plasminogen activator was reduced at 3.7 +/- 0.7 mg/l (mean +/- SEM) in the diabetic group compared with 8.5 +/- 1.3 mg/l in the control group (Student's t-test, P less than 0.01), but thereafter the increase in response to hypoglycaemia was similar. The changes in the other variables were not significantly different from the changes in the control group. 3. During acute hypoglycaemia in poorly controlled diabetic patients there is promotion of haemostasis with a greater increase in the concentration of von Willebrand factor, which, in association with the increase in viscosity, might reduce perfusion in diabetic microangiopathy, leading to aggravation of the microvascular complications of diabetes. 
The effects of neurokinin A, neurokinin B, and eledoisin on substance P analysis. Commercial sources for neuropeptide radioimmunoassays have made this sensitive tool available to clinical investigators for monitoring the potential involvement of neuropeptides in pain modulation. We measured substance P-like immunoreactivity in the plasma, saliva, and pericardial fluid of subjects with and without pain (chronic and acute) to determine if substance P levels are altered. Some recent studies have suggested that substance P in various body fluids may be a correlate of chronic pain. To test this correlation it is important to ensure that the assay is measuring what it was designed to measure. Therefore, the influence of three tachykinins on the analysis of substance P concentrations was assessed with a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit. A small (approximately 2 to 6%), apparently nonspecific elevation in measured substance P was found when alpha-neurokinin, beta-neurokinin, or eledoisin was incubated with substance P and its antibody. Our results also indicate an apparent specific affinity of the substance P antibody for alpha-neurokinin (above 1,000 pg/ml) and beta-neurokinin (above 5,000 pg/ml). Substance P levels in the body fluids we tested ranged from 0.47 to 62.88 pg/mg protein (47.4 to 230.8 pg/ml). Levels of the tested tachykinins have not been determined in body fluids. If alpha-neurokinin or beta-neurokinin is found to be present in high concentrations in these fluids, this commercially available substance P kit may overestimate substance P levels. The concentrations of tachykinins necessary to interfere specifically with the assay are 10- to 100-fold higher than substance P in body fluids. 
Role of external bacterial flora in the pathogenesis of acute postoperative endophthalmitis. The source of infecting bacteria is often unknown in postoperative endophthalmitis. Using techniques of molecular epidemiology, the authors demonstrate that an organism isolated from the vitreous was genetically indistinguishable from an isolate recovered from the patient's eyelid, conjunctiva, or nose in 14 (82%) of 17 cases of endophthalmitis. In two cases of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis, after cataract surgery was performed by the same surgeon on the same day, genetic analysis demonstrated that the infecting organisms from the two patients' vitreous were distinct, and, furthermore, that in each case the external isolates were indistinguishable from the vitreous isolate. The results implicate the patients' external tissues as the source of the infecting organism in those cases of acute postoperative endophthalmitis studied. Therefore, attention should be directed toward the external tissues and their microbial flora in the prophylaxis and prevention of postoperative bacterial endophthalmitis. 
Angiographic assessment of the infarct-related residual coronary stenosis after spontaneous or therapeutic thrombolysis The severity of the infarct-related residual coronary stenosis after spontaneous or therapeutic thrombolysis was quantitatively assessed in 91 patients with an acute myocardial infarction who were allocated to treatment in the acute stage with either a thrombolytic agent (100 mg of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator given over 3 h, 49 patients) or a placebo (42 patients). Heparin and aspirin were given to both groups until angiography was performed. Digital subtracted images of the infarct-related coronary vessel were obtained 10 to 14 days after hospital admission and were subsequently analyzed with the use of a computer-assisted coronary stenosis measurement system. Neither treatment group differed significantly in age, gender or location of the culprit coronary lesion. Median values (90% range) in the thrombolysis and control groups were, respectively, 1.95 (0.9 to 5.3) mm versus 1.7 (0.9 to 3.4) mm for stenosis length; 1.4 (0.8 to 2.7) mm versus 1.4 (0.9 to 1.8) mm for minimal luminal diameter; 57% (36% to 75%) versus 58% (44% to 71%) for diameter obstruction; 82% (59% to 95%) versus 82% (68% to 92%) for geometric area obstruction; and 78% (58% to 91%) versus 79% (66% to 90%) for densitometric area obstruction. The difference between the two groups was not statistically significant for any of these measurements. Thus, in this study no significant differences in anatomy or severity of residual coronary stenosis could be demonstrated at 10 to 14 days after an acute myocardial infarction in patients with a recanalized infarct-related vessel, whether or not thrombolytic therapy was given on admission. These results indicate that with effective antithrombotic treatment, gradual endogenous fibrinolysis or more rapid lysis induced by the infusion of a thrombolytic agent results in a similar infarct-related coronary lesion at the time of hospital discharge. 
A comparative study of the cerebrovascular complications of cocaine: alkaloidal versus hydrochloride--a review. Cocaine, especially in its alkaloidal or "crack" form, has been increasingly associated with cerebrovascular disease. Before the crack epidemic, cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) was also implicated as a cause of stroke. However, less is known about the differences in stroke subtypes, age at stroke onset, or presence of underlying structural cerebrovascular disease with different forms of cocaine use. We compared 26 patients (previously reported) from our four institutions plus 16 cases reported in the literature of stroke associated with alkaloidal cocaine to 63 (57 reported in the literature and six not previously reported from our four institutions) cases of stroke associated with cocaine HCl. Ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes are equally likely after alkaloidal cocaine use, whereas cocaine HCl is more likely (approximately 80% of the time) to cause hemorrhagic stroke, with approximately half the intracranial hemorrhages occurring from ruptured cerebral saccular aneurysms or vascular malformations. The presence of an underlying cerebral aneurysm was more common among patients with cocaine HCl-associated strokes than alkaloidal cocaine-associated strokes. Cerebral infarction was significantly more common among the alkaloidal cocaine users than in all the cocaine HCl users, and this was also true when alkaloidal cocaine users were compared with parenteral cocaine HCl (intravenous and intramuscular) users. Only hemorrhagic stroke has been reported with intravenous cocaine HCl use. We conclude that the pathogenesis of cocaine-related stroke is heterogeneous, and depends, in part, on the form of cocaine used. 
Monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor/interleukin-8 is a potential mediator of crystal-induced inflammation. The physical interaction of particulates with resident mononuclear phagocytes is a consistent feature in certain forms of crystal-induced inflammation. In this study, we observed that monosodium urate crystals stimulated the rapid release of neutrophil chemotactic activity from monocytes, and that this activity steadily increased over 24 hours. Because the release of monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic activity was markedly diminished by pretreatment of the monocytes with cycloheximide, and was completely removed from conditioned media by adsorption to heparin-agarose, we addressed the possibility that monocyte-derived neutrophil chemotactic factor/interleukin-8 (IL-8), a heparin-binding neutrophil-activating polypeptide, might modulate these activities. Urate crystal-induced IL-8 secretion from monocytes was verified by radioimmunoassay. In addition, an IL-8-specific antibody markedly inhibited the neutrophil-activating capacity of the conditioned media from monocytes activated by urate crystals, as well as by inflammatory silica crystals. Last, IL-8 was significantly increased in gouty synovial fluids (range 3.0-16.8 ng/ml, mean 8.4 ng/ml, n = 6) relative to osteoarthritic synovial fluids (range 1.1-1.7 ng/ml, mean 1.5 ng/ml, n = 6) (P = 0.006). We conclude that microcrystal-induced secretion of IL-8 by mononuclear phagocytes may mediate a number of forms of crystal-induced inflammation. 
Massive thyroid oncocytoma. A patient with a massive thyroid oncocytoma is presented. The symptoms of hoarseness and dysphagia were due to compression and were relieved by surgical excision of the tumour. 
Inhibition by sodium-potassium citrate (CG-120) of calcium oxalate crystal growth on to kidney stone fragments obtained from extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. Retention of fragments within the kidney after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) continues to be a major shortcoming of this form of stone treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of sodium-potassium citrate to inhibit calcium oxalate crystal nucleation and growth on to stone fragments remaining after ESWL. The continuous flow crystallisation technique was adapted to induce calcium oxalate crystal nucleation and growth on to the surface of fragmented kidney stones and the inhibitory effect of sodium-potassium citrate was assessed by scanning electron microscopy and by determining the relative increase in crystalline mass at final concentrations of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 mmol/l. Sodium-potassium citrate significantly inhibited the deposition of new crystalline calcium oxalate in a dose-dependent manner above 2 mmol/l; these findings were confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. It was concluded that sodium-potassium citrate may provide an effective means of preventing the formation of new kidney stones by the deposition of calcium oxalate on to residual stone fragments resulting from ESWL and that the technique used is an efficient means of testing the efficacy of therapeutic agents to prevent stone recurrence in patients treated with ESWL. 
Interleukin-6 antisense oligonucleotides inhibit the growth of human myeloma cell lines. IL-6 has been shown to be a plasmacytoma growth factor in mice and is believed to play a key role in the development of human multiple myeloma. We investigated the IL-6 requirements for the growth of two human myeloma cell lines, U 266 and RPMI 8226. These cell lines secreted minute amounts of IL-6 (20 U/ml) and featured IL-6 mRNA. IL-6 receptors were detectable at the surface of malignant cells by immunofluorescence. Antibodies to IL-6 did not alter the proliferation of these myeloma cells. There was a dose-dependent decrease, however, in [3H]-thymidine uptake in the presence of IL-6 antisense (and not sense) oligodeoxynucleotides; in the presence of 20 microM IL-6 antisense, an 80 and 95% inhibition of the proliferation of U 266 and RPMI 8226 cells was observed, respectively. These results provide strong evidence for an IL-6 autocrine proliferation of myeloma cells which may occur via internal interaction between IL-6 and the IL-6 receptor. 
Protection from rotavirus reinfection: 2-year prospective study. To measure protection induced by natural rotavirus infection, 163 infants enrolled in a rotavirus vaccine trial were prospectively followed for 2 years. Serotype 1 rotaviruses were the predominant circulating strains during the study. Over the 2 years of observation, significantly fewer infants infected before enrollment developed a symptomatic reinfection (0 of 21) or any reinfection (4 of 21) compared with previously uninfected infants (P = .0003). Of the 60 infants who developed a primary rotavirus infection in the first year (40 symptomatic, 20 asymptomatic) only 4 were reinfected in the second year compared with 29 of 82 subjects not previously infected (P = .00003). Asymptomatic primary infection appeared to be as protective as symptomatic primary infection. The only symptomatic reinfections occurred in 2 subjects who did not develop rotavirus antibody after the initial detection of rotavirus. An age-related reduction in the ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic primary rotavirus infection was also detected. In this study, protection against homotypic serotype 1 reinfection appeared to last greater than or equal to 2 years. 
Spectral turbulence analysis of the signal-averaged electrocardiogram and its predictive accuracy for inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia. This study was designed to assess the accuracy of a new noninvasive frequency analysis method for predicting patients with inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) at electrophysiologic study and hence the risk of spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Signal-averaged electrocardiograms from 3 orthogonal bipolar surface leads were evaluated using a microcomputer-based frequency analysis system that performs analysis of conventional time-domain late potentials as well as incorporating a new technique for spectral analysis of relatively short, overlapping signal segments spanning the whole QRS complex. The spectral analysis technique measured abnormalities anywhere in the entire QRS complex and did so without dependence on any arbitrarily defined frequency, duration or amplitude cutoffs. The hallmark of arrhythmogenic abnormality was hypothesized to be frequent and abrupt changes in the frequency signature of the QRS wave front velocity as it propagates throughout the ventricle around areas of abnormal conduction, resulting in a high degree of spectral turbulence. One-hundred forty-two subjects were studied, including 71 totally normal control subjects ("true negatives"), 33 with both late potentials by time-domain analysis and inducible sustained monomorphic VT ("true positives"), 28 with late potentials but no evidence of spontaneous or inducible sustained monomorphic VT ("false positives") and 10 with inducible sustained monomorphic VT but absence of time-domain late potentials ("false negatives"). The frequency analysis technique correctly classified 100% of the true negatives, 97% of the true positives, 86% of the late potentials false positives and 60% of the late potentials false negatives. The total predictive accuracy of frequency analysis for all groups was 94%, compared with 73% for time-domain late potential analysis. The results suggest that a high degree of spectral turbulence of the overall QRS signal during sinus rhythm may provide a more accurate marker for the anatomic-electrophysiologic substrate of reentrant tachyarrhythmias than detection of late potentials in the terminal QRS region by either time- or frequency-domain analysis. Spectral turbulence analysis is applicable to patients irrespective of the QRS duration and the presence or absence of bundle branch block. 
Changes in hypertension treatment and in congestive heart failure mortality in the United States. The use of antihypertensive agents has increased in recent years and has been more marked among individuals in older age groups (65-74 years) than in middle-aged groups (45-54 years). Because hypertension is a strong risk factor for the development of congestive heart failure, more common use of antihypertensive agents would be expected to reduce the incidence of congestive heart failure. Examination of the national death statistics reveals decreases in congestive heart failure mortality at younger ages with mortality increases at older ages. The reasons for these divergent trends in congestive heart failure mortality in different ages and the apparent inconsistency with respect to the changes in the use of antihypertensive drugs are explored. We speculate that antihypertensive treatment does not completely prevent congestive heart failure but merely postpones its development by several decades. 
Unresectable pancreatic cancer: what is the optimal procedure? We retrospectively reviewed cases of pancreatic cancer to determine the benefit of various methods of biliary decompression and the role of prophylactic gastroenterostomy (GE) in management. Twenty-seven patients had only biliary bypass, and 26 had biliary bypass and GE. Operative mortality was similar for both groups (22% and 19%, respectively). The complication rates were almost identical (37% and 35%). Differences in operative mortality, incidence of cholangitis, and recurrence of jaundice were not statistically significant between patients having biliary decompression via the common bile duct or the gallbladder. Operative mortality associated with choledochoenterostomy was 33% versus 17% for cholecystoenterostomy. Gastric outlet obstruction developed in 5% of patients who did not have GE. We conclude that cholecystojejunostomy is an effective method of biliary bypass. Because its addition did not seem to increase operative morbidity or mortality, we advocate GE at the initial exploration to prevent gastric outlet obstruction. 
The desmoid tumor: "benign" neoplasm, not a benign disease. The desmoid tumor is a rare neoplasm which, because of its histopathologic appearance, has been traditionally considered to be benign. Despite its benign microscopic features, it has an aggressive local behavior and, if not excised adequately, has a tendency to recur locally and invade neighboring structures with significant potential for morbidity, deformity, or even death. Two cases of recurrent extraabdominal desmoid tumors are presented not only because they are highly representative of this disease, but also because they emphasize the need for aggressive surgical treatment. Also, they are unusual and challenging cases from a reconstructive standpoint. Based on this experience and on the most recent literature, we believe that this tumor, regardless of its microscopic features, should be addressed and treated as a malignancy. 
Late recurrent Candida endocarditis. Late recurrent Candida endocarditis (LRCE) developed on a prosthetic mitral valve 22 months after treatment for primary native mitral valve endocarditis. The LRCE was difficult to diagnose; results of two dimensional echocardiography and repeated blood cultures were negative. Only transesophageal echocardiography revealed a vegetation and only lysis centrifugation blood cultures demonstrated candidemia. Postmortem examination revealed a large Candida vegetation on the prosthetic valve and Candida in the mitral valve ring. This case and a review of the literature indicate that Candida endocarditis treated with amphotericin B and prosthetic valve replacement may recur months after treatment, and that LRCE, which is difficult to diagnose and treat, may be best prevented by lifelong antifungal suppressive therapy. 
Differential effects of intrathecal midazolam on morphine-induced antinociception in the rat: role of spinal opioid receptors. The antinociceptive effects of an intrathecally administered benzodiazepine agonist midazolam, alone and in combination with morphine, were examined in the rat by using the tail-flick test. The duration of antinociceptive effect produced by midazolam was significantly less (P less than 0.05) than that produced by morphine. Low doses of midazolam (10 micrograms) and morphine (10 micrograms) produced a synergistic effect in prolonging antinociceptive effect. However, at higher doses (20 or 30 micrograms), these drugs reduced the extent of antinociception produced by each other. Naloxone administration prevented antinociception produced by these drugs, indicating interactions between midazolam and opioid receptors. Midazolam had dual effects on the binding of opioid ligands to the spinal opioid receptors. At low dose, it potentiated the displacement of [3H]naloxone by morphine. At higher doses, midazolam inhibited the binding of opioid ligands to their spinal receptors in the following order: kappa greater than delta greater than mu. These results indicate that differential antinociceptive effects of midazolam on morphine-induced antinociception involve interaction of this benzodiazepine with spinal opioid receptors. 
Neuroendocrine activity in untreated heart failure. Neuroendocrine activity was studied in 60 consecutive untreated patients with dyspnoea and a clinical suspicion of heart failure. On the basis of the so-called Boston clinical criteria the diagnosis of heart failure was regarded as unlikely in 26 patients, possible in 15 patients, and definite in 19 patients. These groups were studied before any drug treatment was started and were compared with a control group of 69 healthy individuals. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration was clearly raised in patients with definite heart failure and slightly raised in patients with possible heart failure. Plasma adrenaline concentration was somewhat raised in patients with definite or possible heart failure, whereas plasma noradrenaline concentration was raised only in patients with definite heart failure. Plasma renin activity was not increased in any of the patient groups and plasma aldosterone concentration was slightly increased only in patients with definite heart failure. In the total patient series there were significant correlations between plasma atrial natriuretic peptide concentration and markers of the severity of left ventricular dysfunction. There was some evidence of neuroendocrine activation in untreated heart failure: plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and catecholamines were increased but the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system showed little or no activation. 
Intelligence at six years in relation to neonatal bilirubin levels: follow-up of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Clinical Trial of Phototherapy. Results of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Randomized Controlled Trial of Phototherapy were examined for the relationship of neonatal bilirubin level to neurological and developmental outcome at 6-year follow-up. This analysis focused on 224 control children with birth weight of less than 2000 g. Bilirubin levels were maintained below previously specified levels by the use of exchange transfusion only (24%). Rates of cerebral palsy were not significantly higher for children with elevated maximum bilirubin level than for those whose level remained low. No association was evident between maximum bilirubin level and IQ (Full Scale, Verbal, or Performance) by simple correlation analysis (r = -.087, P = .2 for Full Scale) or by multiple linear regression adjusting for factors that covary with IQ (beta = -.15, P = .58). IQ was not associated with mean bilirubin level, time and duration of exposure to bilirubin, or measures of bilirubin-albumin binding. Thus, over the range of bilirubin levels permitted in this clinical trial, there was no evidence of bilirubin toxicity to the central nervous system. Measures used to control the level of bilirubin in low birth weight neonates appear to prevent effectively the risk of bilirubin-induced neurotoxicity. 
Chemotherapy for invasive thymoma. A 13-year experience. From 1977 to 1990, 37 patients with Stage III or IV invasive thymoma (20 men and 17 women; median age, 40 years of age) were referred for chemotherapy to the Padova Medical Oncology Department. All patients initially received the same regimen (50 mg/m2 of cisplatin and 40 mg/m2 of doxorubicin intravenously (IV) on day 1, 0.6 mg/m2 of vincristine IV on day 3, and 700 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide IV on day 4 [ADOC]), recycling at monthly intervals. No life-threatening side effects were noted. The overall clinical response rate (complete response plus partial response) was 91.8%, with 43% complete remissions. Median duration of response and survival were 12 months (range, 2 to 96+ months) and 15 months (range, 5 to 96+ months), respectively. Seven of the 16 complete remissions were pathologically confirmed at subsequent thoracotomy. Other chemotherapy combinations and radiation therapy have been applied as second-line treatment, achieving only minimal responses. In the opinion of the authors, such chemotherapy deserves evaluation for adjuvant and neo-adjuvant treatment of invasive (and/or inoperable) thymoma due to the high complete response rate and overall response rate. 
Comparison of usefulness of high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography and exercise electrocardiography for detection of asymptomatic restenosis after coronary angioplasty. The present study compares the relative usefulness of the maximal treadmill exercise electrocardiography test with the high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography test (echocardiographic monitoring during dipyridamole infusion up to 0.84 mg/kg in 10 minutes) in detecting severe restenosis or coronary artery disease progression (greater than 70% stenosis) in asymptomatic patients 12 months after a primary successful coronary angioplasty. Criteria of positivity were: for the exercise electrocardiography test, an ST-segment shift greater than or equal to 0.1 mV from baseline, 0.08 second from the J point; for the dipyridamole echocardiography test, a transient dyssynergy of contraction, absent or of a lesser degree than that in the baseline examination. The exercise electrocardiography and dipyridamole echocardiography tests revealed a similar feasibility (91 vs 87%, difference not significant). Both tests could be performed in 75 patients. For detection of restenosis or disease progression, or both, the exercise electrocardiography test revealed a sensitivity similar to the dipyridamole echocardiography test (71 vs 71%, difference not significant), but a lower specificity (61 vs 90%). It is concluded that the high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography test is equally feasible but more accurate than the exercise electrocardiography test for noninvasive detection of severe asymptomatic restenosis or disease progression at 1 year after successful coronary angioplasty. 
Pyoderma gangrenosum in inflammatory bowel disease. Since 1954, 34 patients have attended St. Mark's Hospital with pyoderma gangrenosum in association either with ulcerative colitis (22 patients) or Crohn's disease (12 patients). Lesions were multiple in 71 per cent and over half were situated below the knees. Ulcerative colitis was active in 11 patients (50 per cent) and Crohn's disease was active in nine (75 per cent) when pyoderma gangrenosum was diagnosed. Associated illnesses--most commonly a seronegative arthritis affecting large joints--were present in 55 per cent and 92 per cent of cases respectively. A diffuse pustular rash appeared in six patients, synchronously with pyoderma in five. In a further seven patients (two with ulcerative colitis, five with Crohn's disease) the onset or course of pyoderma might have been linked to the presence of non-dermatological suppuration. Pyoderma resolved without intestinal resection in two-thirds of patients. When present at the time of surgical resection (15 procedures in 13 patients), pyoderma healed promptly in six cases, only with additional therapy in four cases and very slowly or not at all in five cases. Pyoderma gangrenosum occurs in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Healing after intestinal resection is unpredictable both with respect to timing and extent of resection. 
Acute atherosis in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, small-for-gestational-age infants, and diabetes mellitus. A clinicohistologic study of acute atherosis in late complicated pregnancy was undertaken. Maternal vessels in the placental basal plate, underlying the amniochorial membranes and in placental bed biopsy specimens, were examined histologically. The earliest histologically convincing lesion acceptable as acute atherosis was fibrinoid necrosis with a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate, while lipophages were a late phenomenon. Any maternal uterine vessel that had not undergone physiologic vascular changes could be affected by acute atherosis. Acute atherosis was not seen in normal pregnancies or in pregnancies of diabetic women but was seen in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia, small-for-gestational-age infants, or both. In pregnancies complicated by small-for-gestational-age infants, acute atherosis was not seen in the vessels in the decidua parietalis. 
Economic issues relating to access to medications. Millions of uninsured, low-income workers (a disproportionate number of them black) are financially unable to obtain prescription drugs for treatment of conditions such as hypertension. As a result, funds spent to diagnose their underlying illnesses may be wasted, and they are likely to suffer complications that require much more costly care. The tendency for income levels to be inversely correlated with blood pressure means that those least able to pay for antihypertensive medication are those most susceptible to complications. Since current programs are inadequate to help most of these patients, there is a need for a joint initiative by the federal government and the pharmaceutical industry to fund programs to make medications easily accessible for the medically indigent population. 
Role of mesothelial cells in peritoneal antibacterial defence. Whether phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus by polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes, and peritoneal macrophages takes place when the staphylococci are adherent to monolayers of human mesothelial cells in the absence of opsonins was investigated. Adherence of S aureus to mesothelial monolayers increased significantly when the bacteria were opsonised with pooled human serum, but phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes occurred independently. Phagocytosis by peritoneal macrophages, however, was only marginal. Pretreatment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils with inhibitors of cellular metabolism and motility reduced their phagocytic capacity. These results indicate that the surface of mesothelial cells provides favourable conditions for the elimination of staphylococci in the peritoneal cavity. Phagocytic motility seems to be important in surface phagocytosis. The inability of peritoneal macrophages to phagocytise staphylococci adherent to the mesothelial cells suggests that they contribute little to the antibacterial defence of the peritoneal membrane of patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. 
Single and multiple dose pharmacokinetics of methionyl growth hormone in children with idiopathic growth hormone deficiency. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of methionyl GH (metGH) were characterized in 20 newly diagnosed GH-deficient children (19 males; 12.9 +/- 3.3 yr old; initial height, 138.8 +/- 16.2 cm; weight, 32.1 +/- 13.1 kg) after the first dose (FD) of metGH and again after 4-5 weeks of multiple dosing (MD). All subjects received a total metGH dose of 0.3 mg/kg.week by sc administration, but were randomized to receive the drug daily (D; n = 12; dose, 0.043 mg/kg) or three times per week (TIW; n = 8; dose, 0.1 mg/kg). After drug administration, repeated blood samples (n = 14) were obtained over a 10-h period. Concentrations of metGH from each sample were determined using a monoclonal antibody radiometric assay (range of linearity, 0.5-40.0 ng/ml; coefficient of variation, less than 4%). Plasma concentration vs. time data were curve fit using a nonlinear weighted least squares algorithm which permitted calculation of the following PK parameters (mean +/- SEM; FD vs. MD group): elimination rate constant (0.23 +/- 0.04 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.04 h-1), absorption rate constant (0.43 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.48 +/- 0.04 h-1), elimination half-life (t1/2; 3.01 vs. 2.77 h), total plasma clearance (CL/F; 0.32 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.09 L/h.kg), and apparent volume of distribution (VDss/F; 2.2 +/- 0.14 vs. 3.15 +/- 0.28 L/kg). Both the CL/F and VDss/F of metGH were significantly greater when data from the entire study population were compared on the basis of FD vs. MD administration. With the exception of a larger VDss/F in subjects who received daily (3.6 +/- 0.4 L/kg) vs. TIW metGH (2.4 +/- 0.2 L/kg), no significant differences were found for the PK parameters between the D and TIW dosing groups. In all subjects, absorption of metGH was slow, with an average time to reach maximum concentration (Tmax) of 4.4 h and an absorption t1/2 that ranged from 1.4-1.8 h. Proportionality was also found between the dose and the area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve, suggesting dose-independent PK of metGH. Our data demonstrate that the PK of metGH after sc administration to children are markedly different from those previously reported in adults and, also, do not vary as a consequence of dosing schedule (i.e. D vs. TIW). The apparent increase in CL/F and VDss/F for met GH with multiple dosing may reflect concentration-dependent changes in plasma binding of the drug or, alternatively, represent the effect of increased body mass on the pharmacokinetics of GH. 
The renin-angiotensin system: renal actions and blood pressure regulation. The RAS is part of an extremely powerful feedback system for long-term control of blood pressure and volume homeostasis. Disturbances that tend to lower blood pressure, such as heart failure, cirrhosis, and peripheral vasodilation, cause sodium and water retention until blood pressure returns to normal due, in large part, to the combined actions of ANGII and reduced arterial pressure. In response to increased sodium intake, decreased ANGII formation greatly amplifies the effectiveness of pressure natriuresis, thereby preventing large increases in body fluid volumes and blood pressure. In circumstances in which the RAS is inappropriately activated, the sodium retaining effects of ANGII necessitate increased blood pressure to maintain sodium balance via pressure natriuresis. Because the RAS is so powerful in regulating blood pressure, blockade of the system with ACE inhibitors offers a powerful therapeutic tool in diseases such as hypertension and congestive heart failure. The control of sodium excretion and blood pressure by ANGII is exerted through multiple intrarenal as well as extrarenal effects, including stimulation of aldosterone secretion, which can influence renal excretion. Current evidence suggests that the intrarenal effects of ANGII are quantitatively more important than those mediated by aldosterone in controlling blood pressure and renal excretion. The most important intrarenal effects of ANGII include efferent arteriolar constriction as well as direct effects on sodium transport. The constrictor effect on efferent arterioles also is important in preventing reductions in GFR in circumstances associated with impaired renal perfusion. Therefore blockade of ANGII formation in circumstances such as renal artery stenosis may caused marked reductions in GFR. However, in many patients efferent arteriolar vasodilation caused by ANGII blockade may not lower GFR markedly because of other autoregulatory mechanisms that compensate by causing parallel reductions in afferent arteriolar resistance. In these individuals, chronic ACE inhibition may prove to be beneficial in slowing the progression of renal disease because a reduction in glomerular hydrostatic pressure may help to prevent glomerular damage. 
A randomized clinical trial of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin versus cefotaxime and clindamycin in children with ruptured appendicitis. This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compares the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin (AGC) or cefotaxime and clindamycin (CC) for the treatment of children with complicated appendicitis. Ninety-seven children were randomized. Forty-seven were assigned to the AGC regimen and 50 received CC. Forty-two patients in the AGC group had an appropriate therapeutic outcome, whereas 48 of 50 children who received CC completed the trial successfully (p = NS). There were no differences between the groups with reference to the duration of antibiotic administration, fever, leukocytosis or length of hospitalization. Complications of therapy were uncommon and neither regimen demonstrated a significant advantage from an economic standpoint. We concluded that, in childhood, complicated appendicitis can be treated with either CC or AGC with equal efficacy. 
Type I transforming growth factor-beta receptors on neutrophils mediate chemotaxis to transforming growth factor-beta. Participation of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the inflammatory response is mediated, in part, by soluble factors such as chemotactic peptides and cytokines. Although the cytokine, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), has been shown to recruit monocytes and promote the inflammatory process, its effects on neutrophils are unknown. In this investigation, [125I]TGF-beta 1 affinity binding studies were employed to show that neutrophils express TGF-beta receptors (350 +/- 20 receptors/cell), which exhibit high affinity for the ligand (dissociation constant, 50 pM). Affinity cross-linking studies identified the receptors to be primarily of the type I class. In contrast to the receptors on monocytes, neutrophil TGF-beta receptors were not down-regulated by exposure to specific inflammatory mediators. Additional studies examined whether exposure of neutrophils to TGF-beta could enhance specific functions, as occurs with monocytes. TGF-beta was shown to cause directed migration of neutrophils at femtomolar concentrations, thus it is the most potent neutrophil chemotactic factor yet identified. Neutrophil production of reactive oxygen intermediates was not stimulated by TGF-beta, nor did TGF-beta enhance or depress subsequent PMA- or FMLP-stimulated superoxide production. However, the stable expression of neutrophil TGF-beta receptors, and the capacity of this cytokine to stimulate neutrophil chemotaxis, suggest that the pro-inflammatory effects of TGF-beta are mediated by neutrophils in addition to monocytes. 
Bone modulation in sustained hematopoietic stimulation in mice. To understand the etiology of bone modulation and hypercalcemia observed in granulocytosis of a tumor-bearing animal model and to gain insight into the implication of sustained hematopoietic stimulation on the bone tissue, in vivo responses of normal mouse hematopoietic and bone tissues to long-term injections of recombinant human and murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), murine granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and human erythropoietin were quantitatively analyzed. Osteoclast activation was estimated by the osteoclast-endosteal ratio, determined by morphometric analyses of femoral sections. Medullary and bone areas were measured on transverse ground bone sections of the tibia. Recombinant murine G-CSF provoked marked granulocytosis associated with significant increases in the number of marrow granulocytes and their progenitors, and caused expansion of granulopoietic marrow into fatty marrow. The bone of G-CSF-treated mice showed a significant increase in endosteal osteoclast numbers with medullary area enlargement and a reduction in the bone thickness; indicative of endosteal bone resorption. Although GM-CSF had little effect on granulopoiesis, it caused peritoneal macrophages to increase and induced similar bone changes as those observed in G-CSF treatment. Enhanced erythropoiesis stimulated by erythropoietin was also associated with evidence of endosteal bone resorption. Bone changes induced by these growth factors were not associated with hypercalcemia. These animal studies document association of bone modulation in sustained stimulation of hematopoiesis, and implicate important physiologic effects of hematopoietic growth factors on skeletal tissue in vivo. 
Clinical application of PET for the evaluation of brain tumors. The combination of FDG and PET has demonstrated clinical utility in the evaluation of patients with brain tumors. At the time of diagnosis, FDG PET provides information concerning the degree of malignancy and patient prognosis. After therapy, FDG PET is able to assess persistence of tumor, determine degree of malignancy, monitor progression, differentiate recurrence from necrosis, and assess prognosis. Other studies using PET provide information that may be clinically useful. Determination of tumor blood flow and permeability of the blood-brain barrier may help in the selection of appropriate therapy. Amino acid imaging using 11C-methionine is being evaluated in patients with brain tumors and provides different information than FDG imaging. 
US-guided venipuncture for venography in the edematous leg. A technique for sonographic-guided venipuncture was developed especially for venography made difficult by gross leg edema. Five patients were evaluated in whom venography had been attempted but was initially unsuccessful because of difficult venous access. All five underwent successful venipuncture after sonographic localization of a vein. Ultrasound-guided venipuncture is simple and useful when venous access by palpation is difficult. 
P300 response to tones and speech sounds after cochlear implant: a case report. P300 potentials evoked by tones and spoken words were recorded from a 20-year-old man with a House-3M single-channel cochlear implant. Three months after cochlear implantation, there was a slight appearance of P300 response to both pure-tone stimuli and spoken-word stimuli; 6 months later, clearly identifiable P300 response to both pure-tone stimuli and spoken-word stimuli were obtained. These results are consistent with an encoding improvement for re-establishment of information processing after auditory rehabilitation. 
Behavioral treatment of dizziness secondary to benign positional vertigo following head trauma. Benign positional vertigo (BPV) represents a challenge to rehabilitation due to the subjective nature of the complaint of dizziness, frequent failure of pharmacologic intervention, and complicating psychologic factors. Behavioral therapy was used to treat a 26-year-old woman who complained of debilitating dizzy spells after mild head injury sustained in a motor vehicle accident. During a three-week baseline period before treatment, the patient reported a weekly average of 48 dizzy spells, which prevented participation in independent activities and kept her homebound and psychologically distressed. Nine-week behavioral treatment included biofeedback-assisted relaxation training, psychologic counseling, gaze-fixation practice, desensitization exercise, and generalization training. This protocol has been used successfully to train aviators to combat vertigo and nausea in flight. Our regimen included hourly recording of physical activity, notation of frequency of dizzy spells, and use of behavioral methods during nine weeks. The patient reported 90% reduction in dizzy spells and full resumption of independent activities including driving and athletics. Results are discussed in the context of behavioral problems associated with BPV and application of behavioral methods to the complaint of dizziness. 
Reviewing oral leukoplakia: clinical concepts for the 1990s. Microscopic evidence of dysplasia is not necessary to diagnose leukoplakia. Rather leukoplakia is clinically diagnosed not so much by defining appearances as by excluding other lesions also appearing as oral white plaques. 
Pancreaticobronchial fistula causing lung abscess: case report and brief discussion of the literature. A case report of a patient with an abscess of the lung caused by a pancreaticobronchial fistula is presented. The patient was treated by pulmonary resection and distal pancreatectomy-splenectomy. 
Chinese hamster ovarian cells transfected with the murine interleukin-6 gene cause hypercalcemia as well as cachexia, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis in tumor-bearing nude mice. The effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vivo were assessed by inoculating Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells which were transfected with the murine IL-6 gene in nude mice. Nude mice bearing CHO cells expressing IL-6 developed hypercalcemia. Tumor-bearing mice also showed increases in white cell count, platelet count, and decreases in body weight. In nude mice carrying CHO tumors which had not been transfected with the IL-6 gene, there were no changes in these parameters. These results suggest that increased circulating concentrations of IL-6 in patients with malignant disease may contribute to a number of paraneoplastic syndromes including hypercalcemia, cachexia, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. 
IFN-gamma inhibits inflammatory cell recruitment and the evolution of bacterial cell wall-induced arthritis. Localization of streptococcal cell wall Ag (SCW) in the synovial tissue of treated rats induces an influx of leukocytes and a cell-mediated immune response leading to arthritis and joint destruction. Systemic administration of the T cell product, IFN-gamma (10(6) U/kg/day), suppresses the recruitment of leukocytes into the synovium and effectively inhibits the inflammation and pathology characteristic of SCW-induced arthritis (articular index 10.4 +/- 0.6 for SCW vs 2.0 +/- 0.7 for SCW with IFN-gamma, p less than 0.005). Monocyte-macrophages from animals treated with IFN-gamma exhibited defective chemotactic responses when tested in vitro and furthermore, monocytes cultured with IFN-gamma (25 to 500 U/ml) in vitro had significantly suppressed chemotactic responses to the complement fragment C5a (p less than 0.005). The decreased ability to migrate to C5a was associated with decreased binding of fluorochrome-conjugated C5a indicative of reduced expression of C5a receptors. Based on these data, IFN-gamma that induces monocyte maturation as reflected by increased Ia expression conversely inhibits C5a receptor expression. Although locally elevated IFN-gamma levels may serve to inhibit recruitment away from an inflammatory site, systemic exposure to IFN-gamma appears to inhibit leukocyte recruitment to the inflammatory site by its ability to induce premature maturation and concomitant inability to respond to certain chemotactic ligands. Inasmuch as monocyte recruitment to the synovium is pivotal in the development of SCW-induced polyarthritis, the ability of IFN-gamma to inhibit this event effectively inhibits the synovial pathology. 
Irreducible inguinal hernia in children below two years of age Eighty-five cases of irreducible inguinal hernia in children below 2 years of age were reviewed. Non-operative treatment was successful in 71 (84 per cent); 14 children required emergency surgery. The younger the child and the longer the duration of symptoms at presentation, the worse was the outcome of non-operative treatment. In 35 (41 per cent) children the diagnosis of inguinal hernia had been made before irreducibility. There is an increased incidence of postoperative complication associated with irreducibility, especially in preterm infants. Early diagnosis of inguinal hernia in young children and prompt referral for surgery is recommended. 
Preoperative radiation therapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy in patients with stage II endometrial carcinoma. Seventy-four patients with Stage II endometrial cancer were treated by a combination of preoperative radiation therapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and paraaortic lymph node sampling at the University of Kentucky Medical Center from 1967 to 1988. All patients had histologically confirmed endometrial cancer with involvement of the endocervix. The cell types and numbers of the tumors treated were as follows: adenocarcinoma, 58; adenoacanthoma, six; adenosquamous carcinoma, nine; and clear cell carcinoma, one. Preoperative radiation consisted of 4500 cGy external therapy followed by one intracavitary implant providing an additional 2000 cGy to point A. Surgery was done 4 to 6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. Five patients (7.1%) had paraaortic lymph node metastases. Four were treated with extended-field radiation therapy and one with platinum-based combination chemotherapy. After treatment, the patients were followed at regular intervals from 2 to 22 years (mean, 5.4 years). Eleven patients (15%) had recurrent cancer, with the vagina and upper abdomen being the most common sites of spread. The estimated 5-year and 10-year disease-free survival rates of these patients are 88% and 76%, respectively. Cell type, depth of myometrial invasion, and lymph node status were the most important prognostic variables in the patients evaluated. These data confirm that the combination of preoperative radiation therapy and surgery produces excellent long-term survival in patients with Stage II endometrial cancer. 
Carpal tunnel syndrome in the mucopolysaccharidoses and related disorders. Eighteen patients with various mucopolysaccharidoses or mucolipidosis III were studied electrophysiologically to determine the presence or absence of carpal tunnel syndrome. In 17 patients this was clearly demonstrated, the only exception being a boy with mucopolysaccharidosis II, age 6 months at testing. All patients had a remarkable lack of symptoms. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a very common complication of the mucopolysaccharidoses and mucolipidosis III and should be actively looked for in affected patients. Early diagnosis and treatment offer the best chance of a good response to surgery. 
Expression of the c-myc protein is down-regulated at the terminal stages during in vitro differentiation of B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. The translocated c-myc oncogene in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and murine plasmacytoma (MPC) has been proposed to be expressed at a stage of differentiation at which the gene is normally silent, resulting in a continuous proliferation and an inhibited terminal differentiation. To determine whether c-myc is differently expressed at the various stages of the differentiation pathway, we used B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, representing resting B lymphocytes, inducible to proliferation and/or differentiation in vitro. The c-myc protein, and Ig lambda-light chain and PCA-1 antigen as markers of B-cell maturation, were analyzed in single, morphologically defined cells by immunocytochemical double-staining. The proliferation of individual cells was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation and by analysis of Ki-67 antigen expression. The results show that the level of c-myc expression correlates to the stage of differentiation and to the proliferative activity. Uninduced resting cells did not express c-myc. The c-myc protein was observed in the highest amount at the proliferative B-lymphoblast stage of maturation and was reduced in plasmablasts and undetectable in plasma cells. The results suggest that maturation of B cells into nonproliferative, terminally differentiated plasma cells is associated with a downregulated c-myc expression and thus support the view that the deregulated c-myc gene in BL and MPC is expressed at an inappropriate stage of maturation and thereby inhibits terminal differentiation. 
Adrenal suppression and growth retardation after injection of periocular capillary hemangioma with corticosteroids. Adrenal suppression and/or growth retardation were noted in two patients after injection of periocular capillary hemangiomas with corticosteroids. Parents should be warned of these two potential complications of intralesional corticosteroid therapy. Baseline and posttreatment adrenal function should be monitored. If iatrogenic adrenal suppression occurs, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be necessary in situations involving systemic stress such as infection or surgery. 
Trigeminal neuralgia secondary to tumor with normal exam, responsive to carbamazepine. Trigeminal neuralgia is most commonly idiopathic, although it can be associated with multiple sclerosis. Tumors are rare causes of trigeminal neuralgia. A case is presented of trigeminal neuralgia with normal neurological examination and responsive to carbamazepine, secondary to a cerebellopontine angle meningioma. Literature relative to neoplastic etiologies of trigeminal neuralgia is reviewed. The role of electrodiagnostic testing in the evaluation of trigeminal neuralgia is considered. A normal neurological examination and responsiveness to carbamazepine do not exclude tumor as an etiology of trigeminal neuralgia. 
Is laterality important in neck node metastases in head and neck cancer? We present a series of 2219 previously untreated squamous carcinomas of the head and neck, 141 (6.5%) of whom had bilateral nodes at presentation. Bilateral nodes became progressively less common with increasing age but were not related to other host factors. They were also strongly related to the site of the primary tumour, its T-stage and its histological grade, being more common in tumours of the oro or naso-pharynx, in poorly or moderately differentiated tumours, and in tumour stages T3 or T4 at presentation. There were also interactions between these tumour factors, and patients with all three factors had a 25% incidence of bilateral nodes. 126 of these patients could be matched for the main prognostic factors with 126 patients with unilateral neck node disease. The survival rate of the latter group was 9% better than that of the unilateral group. Further breakdown showed that the survival of patients with nodes smaller than 6 cm is not affected by laterality, whereas it is for patients with massive nodes. 
Comparison of accuracy of transesophageal versus transthoracic echocardiography for the detection of mitral valve prolapse with ruptured chordae tendineae (flail mitral leaflet). The accuracy of transesophageal echocardiography was compared with that of transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of ruptured chordae tendineae (flail mitral leaflet) in 27 patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) who underwent valve repair or replacement for mitral regurgitation. Confirmation of the presence of ruptured chordae resulting in a flail leaflet was available at surgery in all cases. The echocardiographic studies were read blindly by 2 independent observers with any differences resolved by a third. Mean (+/- standard deviation) age was 63 +/- 13 years. Men (n = 20) outnumbered women (n = 7) (p less than 0.02), and tended to be younger (p = 0.06). Flail leaflets were identified in 20 of 27 patients. In 1 patient, both leaflets were involved and in the remaining 19 patients posterior leaflets (15 patients) were more frequently affected than anterior leaflets (4 patients). Transesophageal echocardiography correctly identified all 20 patients with flail leaflets, but 1 false positive study occurred among the 7 patients without a flail leaflet. In contrast, transthoracic echocardiography identified only 12 of 20 patients with flail leaflets, with no false positive studies. Transesophageal echocardiography was more accurate, correctly classifying 26 of 27 (96%) cases versus 19 of 27 (70%) by the transthoracic approach (p less than 0.01). This study suggests a higher incidence of chordal rupture to the posterior leaflet in patients with MVP and demonstrates improved accuracy of transesophageal over transthoracic echocardiography in the detection of flail leaflets. 
Carcinoma and DNA aneuploidy in Crohn's colitis--a histological and flow cytometric study. Twenty four patients with longstanding colonic Crohn's disease were examined prospectively with colonoscopy and multiple biopsy sampling in order to detect histological dysplasia or abnormal aneuploid DNA content, or both. Biopsy specimens were taken from 10 predetermined locations in the colon and rectum. No patient had definite dysplasia but three displayed DNA aneuploidy (12.5%), and one of these subsequently developed a carcinoma (Dukes' C at operation) in the ascending colon. No concomitant dysplasia was detected but the carcinoma as well as other parts of the mucosa were DNA aneuploid. It is concluded that dysplasia is rare in patients with Crohn's colitis, but findings of DNA aneuploidy warrant vigilance in follow up as this may indicate impending carcinoma. Further prospective studies are needed before the predictive value of DNA aneuploidy can be determined and before general recommendations of colonoscopic surveillance, as in longstanding ulcerative colitis, can be made. 
Quality of life after bypass surgery for unstable angina. 5-year follow-up results of a Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study To assess the effect of bypass surgery on outcome from unstable angina, 468 patients were randomized to medical treatment (237 patients) or surgery plus medical treatment (231 patients) and have been followed for comparison of survival, cardiac end points, and quality of life; the latter end point is discussed in the present report. Data were available at 3 and 5 years for 80% and 82% of patients in the medical group, respectively, and 77% and 80% of patients in the surgery group, respectively. At 3 months after randomization to therapy, 79.8% of patients in the surgery group reported subjective improvement, compared with 58% of the medical group, 12.6% of the surgery group reported no change compared with 24.5% of the medical group, and 5.5% of the surgery group reported worsening compared with 24.5% of the medical group (p less than 0.01 by chi 2). Similar data were found for chest pain status, and the benefit to the surgery group remained statistically significant through 5 years of follow-up. Crossover rate to surgery was 43% by 5 years. Treadmill duration was increased in the surgery group compared with the medical group (6.5 +/- 0.25 versus 5.3 +/- 0.25 minutes at 6 months, p less than 0.01), and a significant difference was again demonstrated at 3 and 5 years. A trend toward decreased recurrence of unstable angina was present in the surgery group at 1 year (six of 168 [3.6%] versus 13 of 187 [6.9%] in the medical group, p = 0.158), but the two groups were similar at 3 and 5 years. 
Nutritional assessment of patients with extended left ventricular assist device support. The nutritional status of nine patients with end-stage heart disease who were supported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for more than 30 days while awaiting cardiac transplantation was evaluated. Nutritional status was indicated by the following scale: 0-2, adequate nourishment; 3-5, moderate malnourishment; greater than 5, severe malnourishment. This scale was based on serial assessments of albumin, transferrin, total lymphocyte count, percentage of ideal body weight, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold, and arm muscle circumference. Each variable was compared with established standards before implantation and before transplantation times and assessed 1 point if less than the normal value and 0 points if within the normal range. At the time of LVAD implantation, 5 patients had a score of 0-2, 3 patients had a score of 3-5, and 1 patient had a score greater than 5. At the time of cardiac transplantation, 7 patients had a score of 0-2, 2 patients had a score of 3-5, and no patients had a score greater than 5. The patients who were able to meet at least 50% of their daily caloric and protein requirements by oral intake alone were noted. At LVAD implantation, only 2 patients (22%) met this requirement; however, 6 patients (67%) met this requirement at the time of cardiac transplantation. All 9 patients underwent cardiac transplantation, and 8 survived. Thus, it appears that extended LVAD support and maintenance of hemodynamic stability allow patients to regain the desire and ability to achieve adequate nutritional status, which may considerably reduce their perioperative transplant risks. 
The origin of symptoms on the brain-gut axis in functional dyspepsia. It was hypothesized that symptoms in functional dyspepsia are originated by an altered mechanism at the brain-gut axis (one or several) in the process of gastric accommodation to a meal. To test the key mechanisms potentially involved in symptomatic gastric accommodation, the sensorial responses (on a 0-10 perception score) and the gastric tone responses (by electronic barostat) to either gastric accommodation (n = 10) or to cold stress (n = 10) were measured in 20 patients with functional dyspepsia and 20 healthy controls. The mechanical accommodation of the stomach to gastric distention (compliance) was similar in patients (52 +/- 8 mL/mm Hg) and controls (57 +/- 6 mL/mm Hg). However, isobaric gastric distention elicited more upper abdominal discomfort in dyspeptics than in controls (perception scores, 4.7 +/- 0.9 vs. 1.1 +/- 0.5, respectively; mean +/- SE; P less than 0.005). Cold stress induced a similar gastric relaxatory response in dyspeptics and controls (delta vol, 145 mL +/- 40 mL vs. 141 mL +/- 42 mL, respectively); hand perception (scores, 8.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.9 +/- 0.4, respectively) and autonomic responses were also similar. It is concluded that an abnormal afferent sensorial pathway (altered gastric perception) may be a major mechanism of symptom production in functional dyspepsia. 
Electrogram patterns predictive of successful catheter ablation of accessory pathways. Value of unipolar recording mode. BACKGROUND. Transcatheter electrical ablation has been used in the treatment of arrhythmias, and most experience has been obtained by ablating the normal atrioventricular conduction system. Less information is available on ablation of atrioventricular accessory pathways. METHODS AND RESULTS. Catheter ablation of overt accessory pathways was attempted in 135 patients with 142 distinct pathways, including 21 right parietal or anteroseptal, 47 posteroseptal, and 74 left lateral pathways. We sought to identify the type and value of electrophysiological parameters associated with successful ablation outcome. For this purpose, the unipolar recording mode was used in addition to bipolar anterograde and retrograde parameters. With a mean follow-up of 16 +/- 6 (mean +/- SD) months, fulguration was successful in eliminating preexcitation in 129 patients (96%), including all seven with two distinct accessory pathways. The first ablation attempt was successful in 110 patients, and two or more attempts were performed in 25 patients. Bipolar electrograms associated with success of fulguration showed a shorter atrioventricular conduction time (40 +/- 13 versus 53 +/- 17 msec, p less than 0.0001) and an earlier main ventricular deflection relative to delta wave onset (-1.7 +/- 10 versus 5 +/- 7 msec, p less than 0.001) than electrograms associated with unsuccessful outcome. The only parameter dealing with retrograde conduction (i.e., ventriculoatrial conduction time during reciprocating tachycardia) was not predictive (86 +/- 17 versus 93 +/- 17 msec). Neither was the atrial to ventricular electrogram amplitude ratio. Two unipolar parameters were found to be predictive of successful outcome: 1) The three different patterns PQS, P-QS, P-rS of unipolar waves recorded at the annulus were associated with respective success rates of 97%, 78%, and 55% (p less than 0.001). 2) Intrinsic deflection timing occurred -4 +/- 8 and 6 +/- 7 msec relative to delta wave onset in successful attempts and in failures, respectively (p less than 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed a single independent factor predictive of success, the unipolar pattern (p = 0.03), with an odds ratio of 7:1 (PQS pattern versus P-rS pattern). In the group of 18 patients who underwent a first unsuccessful but second successful attempt, comparison of electrograms revealed no difference in the ventriculoatrial conduction time but a significant improvement in anterograde parameters and unipolar pattern distribution. CONCLUSIONS. Some distinctive electrogram patterns concerning anterograde conduction are associated with success of accessory pathway fulguration. The unfiltered unipolar recording mode (PQS pattern) contributes significantly to optimizing the accuracy of accessory pathway localization. 
A prospective study of cholesterol, apolipoproteins, and the risk of myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND. The independent contributions of subfractions of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL2 and HDL3) and apolipoproteins in predicting the risk of myocardial infarction are unclear. Prospective data are sparse, but HDL2 is widely believed to be a more important predictor than HDL3. METHODS. Blood samples were collected at base line from 14,916 men (ages, 40 to 84 years) who were participants in the Physicians' Health Study. After five years of follow-up, plasma samples from 246 men with new myocardial infarction (case subjects) were analyzed together with specimens from 246 men matched to them for age and smoking status who had not had a myocardial infarction. RESULTS. The levels of total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B-100 were significantly associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction (data on levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were unavailable). Both HDL cholesterol and HDL2 levels were associated with a substantially decreased risk of myocardial infarction, but the HDL3 level was the strongest predictor; the relative risk was 0.3 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.2 to 0.6) for those in the fifth of the group with the highest HDL3 levels, as compared with the fifth with the lowest levels. The benefit of a higher HDL cholesterol level was most pronounced among those with lower total cholesterol levels. Levels of apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-II were also associated with decreased risk. However, the levels of HDL subfractions and apolipoproteins did not add significantly to the value of a multivariate model that included the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol in predicting myocardial infarction, whereas that ratio remained a significant independent predictor of risk. After adjustment for other risk factors, a change of one unit in the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol was associated with a 53 percent change in risk (95 percent confidence interval, 26 percent to 85 percent). CONCLUSIONS. This study underscores the importance of HDL cholesterol in predicting the risk of myocardial infarction and demonstrates protective effects of both the HDL3 and HDL2 subfractions of HDL cholesterol. We found little or no predictive value for the levels of apolipoproteins A-I, A-II, and B or HDL subfractions after conventional risk factors and the ratio of total to HDL cholesterol were considered. 
The effect of streptokinase on chest pain in acute myocardial infarction. Treatment with intravenous streptokinase is known to restore blood flow to the ischaemic myocardium in patients with acute myocardial infarction. However, little is known about its effect on chest pain. In a retrospective cohort study, 76 patients treated with streptokinase were compared to 76 patients not treated with streptokinase. All patients had acute myocardial infarction and less than 6 h of cardiac symptoms. Patients treated with streptokinase had a significantly lower need for nicomorphine (median 20 mg) than patients not treated with streptokinase (median 41 mg). Correspondingly, the median duration (3.5 h) of pain was reduced significantly in patients treated with streptokinase compared to patients not treated (24 h). We conclude that intravenous streptokinase given in the acute phase of myocardial infarction is effective in reducing the duration of cardiac chest pain. 
Tumor induction in a rat model for ureterosigmoidostomy without evidence of nitrosamine formation. Twenty rats were randomized into a vesicosigmoidostomy and an unoperated control group. In both groups the 24 hour excretion of secondary amines, nitrate, nitrite and nitrosamines was measured before and after gavage of proline and nitrate, piperazine and nitrate, N-nitrosoproline, mono-N-nitrosopiperazine. The urinary nitrosamine concentrations were not significantly different between both groups neither before nor after application of the several substances. Thirty rats were randomized into two vesicosigmoidostomy groups with and without antibiotic coverage and an unoperated control group. After ligation of distal rectum and mesosigmoid the rectosigmoids were removed. No significant concentrations of volatile nitrosamines could be measured in the rectosigmoid contents of the three groups. One hundred and twenty rats randomized into three groups following vesicosigmoidostomy received the potential nitrosamine antidotes sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate or sodiumpentosan-polysulfate or acted as controls. 12/118 (10.2%) developed adenomas and 25/118 (21.2%) adenocarcinomas at the vesico-colonic anastomosis with no significant differences between the three groups concerning tumor incidence or mortality. The results show that colon carcinomas occur in a rat model for ureterosigmoidostomy without evidence for thus induced nitrosamine formation. This and the missing effect of nitrosamine antidotes suggest that other factors than nitrosation must be responsible for colon carcinogenesis following urinary diversion via intestine. 
The role of serotonin-1A receptor activation and alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade in the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil. Our study had three purposes: 1) to determine whether 5-methyl-urapidil, topically applied to the ventrolateral medulla, produces hypotension by activating serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptors, 2) to determine whether 5-methyl-urapidil given i.v. produces hypotension in part by activating 5-HT1A receptors in the ventrolateral medulla, and 3) to determine the specific site within the ventrolateral medulla where 5-methyl-urapidil elicits a hypotensive response. In terms of the first purpose, 5-methyl-urapidil applied bilaterally to the intermediate area of the ventral surface of the medulla (1.2 micrograms/side) of chloralose-anesthetized cats produced a decrease in mean arterial pressure of -39 +/- 4 mm Hg (N = 8). Prior blockade of 5-HT1A receptors at this site with bilateral application of spiperone (30 micrograms/side) prevented the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil (mean blood pressure now increased by 5 +/- 4 mm Hg). Pretreatment with the alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonist, prazosin, did not prevent the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil. In terms of the second purpose, spiperone applied bilaterally to the ventral surface of the medulla counteracted a significant portion of the hypotensive effect of 5-methyl-urapidil given by the i.v. route. The dose of 5-methyl-urapidil given intravenously was below the dose that produces alpha-1 adrenoceptor blockade. In terms of the third purpose, microinjection of 5-methyl-urapidil into central nervous system sites associated with the intermediate area was found to have its greatest hypotensive effect at the subretrofacial nucleus. Mean arterial pressure decreased by 74 +/- 14 mm Hg (N = 3) after bilateral microinjection of 25 ng of the drug. 
Initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer: value of routine radioisotope bone scanning. The exclusion of bone metastases is important in the initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer, though there is debate about whether bone scans should be performed routinely or restricted to patients who present with clinical or laboratory indicators suggesting skeletal metastases. In a prospective study of 110 consecutive patients referred for initial staging of non-small cell lung cancer, we assessed the sensitivity of a group of clinical indicators (chest pain, skeletal pain, bone tenderness on physical examination, serum alkaline phosphatase, and serum calcium) for the presence of skeletal metastases as determined by bone scanning. The final staging result was validated with follow up data over at least three years. At the initial staging 37 of 110 bone scans (34%) showed areas of increased uptake, of which only nine were confirmed to be metastases (by tomography, computed tomography, or biopsy). Half the patients (55) had at least one clinical indicator suggesting skeletal metastases, including all patients with proved skeletal metastases. Thus the sensitivity of these clinical indicators was 100% and the specificity 54%. Within one year three of 27 patients with non-confirmed positive bone scans had skeletal metastases, one of which was in the area that had shown increased uptake initially. All these patients had clinical indicators for skeletal metastases and all had inoperable advanced tumours. Four of 69 patients with an initially negative bone scan developed skeletal metastases within one year. It is concluded that in non-small cell lung cancer bone scanning can be restricted to patients with clinical indicators for skeletal metastases. This approach reduces the number of bone scans and consecutive investigations without loss of sensitivity in the detection of skeletal metastases. 
FK 506 ameliorates the hepatic injury associated with ischemia and reperfusion in rats. The effect of FK 506 on regeneration of the liver was studied in rats after a two-thirds partial hepatectomy after 60 min of ischemia of the unresected liver. The animals were divided into three distinct groups of 10 rats each. Group 1 (controls) received 0.5 ml saline solution intravenously 30 min after the induction of ischemia. Groups 2 and 3 were injected with FK 506 (0.3 mg/kg) intravenously 30 min after and 24 min before the induction of hepatic ischemia, respectively. The hepatic content of ATP and serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase were determined on each animal. In addition, the histological appearance and mitotic activity of the remnant liver was determined at regular 24-hr intervals after hepatic ischemia. All 10 control animals died within 72 hr. Treatment with FK 506 resulted in improved survival in groups 2 and 3 (30% and 80%, respectively). The improved survival seen in the FK 506-treated animals was reflected by a restoration of hepatic ATP content, a reduction in the serum levels of ALT and lactate dehydrogenase, an amelioration of hepatic necrosis and neutrophilic infiltration and an increase in the mitotic activity of the liver. These results suggest that FK 506 ameliorates the hepatic injury associated with ischemia/reperfusion and has a potent stimulatory effect on liver cell regeneration that may make it valuable as a hepatoprotective agent when administered to organ donors before graft harvesting. 
Natural history of indeterminate colitis. The long-term outcome of patients with a pathological diagnosis of indeterminate colitis on a colectomy specimen was investigated. The case records of 46 such patients operated on for inflammatory bowel disease between 1960 and 1983 were reviewed. Using the preoperative clinical information, pathological and radiological reports, it was possible to divide the patients into three groups: group 1, probable Crohn's disease (19 cases); group 2, probable ulcerative colitis (11 cases); and group 3, indeterminate colitis (16 cases). The patients were followed for a minimum of 2.5 years (median 10, range 2.5-28 years). During this period the probable diagnosis changed in five cases only. One patient in group 1 (Crohn's disease) was subsequently considered to have ulcerative colitis (group 2). The other four patients were all in group 3. Three were reclassified as ulcerative colitis and the fourth as Crohn's disease on the finding of a single granuloma in a rectal biopsy. No case in group 3 required subsequent small bowel surgery. These data suggest that patients continuing with a diagnosis of indeterminate colitis in spite of careful preoperative and postoperative assessment are unlikely to show features of Crohn's disease in the long term. This may be important when considering a subsequent restorative proctectomy. 
Ventricular tachycardia originating from the right ventricular free wall in a patient with an old myocardial infarction. A 64-year-old woman with right ventricular infarction had ventricular tachycardia (VT) with left bundle-branch block morphology. Pace-mapping during sinus rhythm and the earliest ventricular potential during VT suggested that the VT originated in the inflow-inferior site of the right ventricular free wall. 
Autonomic nervous dysfunction in essential hypertension. Borderline hypertension, a condition in which the blood pressure oscillates between normal and high values, is a predictor of future more severe hypertension. Pathophysiologically, borderline hypertension is different from established hypertension. A large proportion of such patients have elevated cardiac output and a normal vascular resistance. In established hypertension, the output is normal and resistance is elevated. The elevation of cardiac output in borderline hypertension is neurogenic; it can be abolished by an autonomic blockade of the heart. In addition to an increased cardiac sympathetic drive, increased sympathetic tone to the kidney, arterioles, and veins has also been found. In parallel with the hypersympathetic state, patients with borderline hypertension also show decreased parasympathetic tone. The enhanced sympathetic tone leads to a decreased cardiac responsiveness, and eventually, the cardiac output returns to the normal range. High blood pressure causes vascular hypertrophy, and hypertrophic vessels are hyperresponsive to vasoconstriction. These secondary changes in the responsiveness of the heart and blood vessels are the basis of transition from a high cardiac output to high-resistance hypertension. These hemodynamic changes are associated with a downregulation of the sympathetic tone. A picture of an apparently nonneurogenic high-resistance hypertension emerges. Nevertheless, when assessed in regard to the enhanced pressor responsiveness, the sympathetic drive in such patients is still excessive. Despite the apparently normal tone, the sympathetic nervous system continues to play an important pathophysiological role in established hypertension. Borderline hypertension is associated with numerous metabolic abnormalities including obesity and insulin resistance. It is tempting to view all these abnormalities as a common expression of the increased sympathetic drive in hypertension. Explanation of the basis of the association of hypertension and metabolic abnormalities promises to bring new insights into the pathophysiology of two common diseases of civilization: hypertension and diabetes mellitus. 
The Western Washington Myocardial Infarction Registry and Emergency Department Tissue Plasminogen Activator Treatment Trial. This study comprised a registry and an emergency department treatment trial using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. During 1 year, 1,028 patients with documented acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were evaluated for eligibility for thrombolytic therapy. Of these, 221 patients (22%) were eligible for thrombolytic therapy under currently accepted criteria, 175 (79%) of them were correctly identified by emergency department physicians for thrombolytic therapy, and 160 were enrolled in the trial. Only 3 patients (2%) enrolled by emergency department physicians did not subsequently evolve documented AMI. In all, 807 patients (78%) were ineligible for thrombolytic therapy: 335 (33%) because of greater than or equal to 1 contraindications, 364 (36%) because of nondiagnostic electrocardiograms on presentation, and 105 (10%) because of age greater than 75 years, or greater than 6 hours of chest pain at presentation, or both. Mortality in treated patients at 14 days was 5.6%, and survival at 1 year was 92%. The mean time from hospital arrival to thrombolytic treatment was 55 +/- 27 minutes. Initial management of AMI with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in the emergency department provided rapid and safe treatment comparable to that reported in trials that started treatment in the coronary care unit. The proportions of eligible patients could be increased from 1 in 5 to 1 in 3, if patients currently excluded only because of age greater than 75 years or because of greater than 6 hours of chest pain were offered treatment. 
Liver viability after ischemia-reperfusion. Lack of a reproducible model to quantitatively assess hepatocellular injury following ischemia has made it difficult to assess new strategies for minimizing hepatic injury. We studied the progression of hepatocellular injury after ischemia and ischemia with reperfusion in rats. Irreversible injury was quantitated using a triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay that was shown to correlate with ultrastructural changes. Adenosine triphosphate decreased to 36% of basal values after 30 minutes, but returned to normal with reperfusion with no decrease in viability. In contrast, viability fell by 30% after 60 minutes of ischemia, and by 64% when 60 minutes of ischemia was followed by reperfusion. We conclude that reperfusion of ischemic liver increases the degree of irreversible damage. The model employed here seems to be useful for studying ischemic and reperfusion injury in the liver. 
Assessment of systolic thickening with thallium-201 ECG-gated single-photon emission computed tomography: a parameter for local left ventricular function. We measured left ventricular (LV) systolic thickening expressed as a systolic thickening ratio in 28 patients, using 201Tl ECG-gated SPECT. Five normals, 15 patients with prior myocardial infarction, 5 with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 3 with dilated cardiomyopathy were studied. The systolic thickening ratio was calculated as [(end-systolic--end-diastolic pixel counts) divided by end-diastolic pixel counts], using the circumferential profile technique of both end-diastolic and end-systolic short axial images. Functional images of the systolic thickening ratio were also displayed with the "bull's-eye" method. The mean systolic thickening ratio thus calculated were as follows: normals, 0.53 +/- 0.05 (mean +/- 1 s.d.); non-transmural prior myocardial infarction, 0.33 +/- 0.09; transmural prior myocardial infarction, 0.14 +/- 0.05; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in relatively nonhypertrophied areas, 0.56 +/- 0.11; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in hypertrophied areas, 0.23 +/- 0.07; and dilated cardiomyopathy, 0.19 +/- 0.02. The systolic thickening ratio analysis by gated thallium SPECT offers a unique approach for assessing LV function. 
Two-dimensional Doppler echocardiographic correlation of dipyridamole-thallium stress testing with isometric handgrip. To determine how frequently new wall-motion abnormalities that are indicative of ischemia accompany thallium redistribution, 47 consecutive patients underwent two-dimensional echocardiography during routine dipyridamole-thallium stress testing. A secondary aim of the study was to determine whether the addition of isometric handgrip exercises to the standard dipyridamole imaging protocol increased the frequency of wall-motion abnormalities or thallium redistribution. Echocardiograms and thallium scans were independently interpreted, and wall-motion abnormalities that appeared with dipyridamole, handgrip exercise, or both were compared with results of thallium imaging. Five of 24 patients with thallium redistribution had new wall-motion abnormalities, and the extent (number of segments) of thallium redistribution in these five patients was significantly greater than in those who did not have well-motion abnormalities (p less than 0.03). The addition of isometric handgrip exercises to the imaging protocol did not distinguish between patients with and without new wall-motion abnormalities or thallium redistribution. Thus new wall-motion abnormalities infrequently accompany thallium redistribution in routine dipyridamole stress testing in spite of the addition of handgrip exercises, but when new wall-motion abnormalities are present, they are associated with a greater area of thallium redistribution. 
An increased number of gamma/delta T-cells and gastric epithelial cell expression of the groEL stress-protein homologue in Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis of the antrum. Numerous studies have shown that the presence of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach is linked to the development of chronic gastritis most commonly seen in the antrum. However, the pathogenic mechanisms are unclear. In 23 of 31 patients, examined due to symptoms from the upper gastrointestinal tract, H. pylori-associated chronic gastritis of the antrum was diagnosed histologically and by growth of H. pylori. Immunoperoxidase staining on gastric biopsy specimens from these patients showed an increased number of gamma/delta T-cells within the epithelium. Furthermore, the Mab ML30 (raised against the 65 kDa heat shock protein of mycobacteria) demonstrated positive staining in the gastric epithelial cells in all H. pylori-positive but not in H. pylori-negative biopsy specimens. H. pylori also reacted with ML30, as detected by immunoperoxidase staining as well as by immunoblotting. Intraepithelial gamma/delta T cells may play a role in host defense against invading H. pylori, and the bacteria may trigger an autoimmune response to stress proteins expressed by the gastric epithelial cells. 
Endoscopic sonography of the upper gastrointestinal tract. Endoscopic sonography was used to examine the upper gastrointestinal tract of 550 patients referred for evaluation of abnormal findings seen on conventional endoscopy, upper gastrointestinal series, and CT. This essay illustrates the potential uses and limitations of this technique. Special emphasis has been given to the use of landmarks to facilitate orientation of the transducer in both the esophagus and stomach. Specific examples demonstrate involvement of individual layers of the bowel wall in both benign and malignant processes. It is stressed that this is a combined procedure requiring both an endoscopist and a radiologist. Endoscopic sonography is a valuable new technology with substantial potential in the evaluation of the upper gastrointestinal tract. 
Effects of lidocaine on reperfusion arrhythmias and electrophysiological properties in an isolated ventricular muscle model of ischemia and reperfusion. Transmembrane electrical activity was recorded from endo- and epicardium of isolated segments of guinea pig right ventricles with standard microelectrode techniques. An ECG was also recorded by two electrodes placed at opposite ends of the tissue bath. Regular stimulation was delivered to the endocardium. Tissues were exposed to simulated ischemia for 15 min and then were reperfused with "normal" Tyrode's solution. Rapid sustained or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, bigeminy or trigeminy with characteristics of transmural reentry occurred in early reperfusion in 14 of 20 hearts (70%). Arrhythmias were accompanied by prolongation of transmural conduction time and abbreviation of endocardial effective refractory period. With lidocaine, at 1, 5, 10 and 50 microM, reperfusion arrhythmias occurred in 53.3, 22.2, 20.8 and 14.3% of hearts, respectively. The decreased incidence of arrhythmias was statistically significant for 5 to 50 microM lidocaine (P less than .01). The antiarrhythmic effect did not correlate with changes in transmural conduction time, endocardial effective refractory period, or endocardial excitability. However, antiarrhythmic concentrations of lidocaine selectively depressed epicardial excitability and significantly increased endo- to epicardial conduction block during late ischemic and early reperfusion periods. Epicardial inexcitability extended to late diastole and conduction block was not restricted to premature beats. Thus, in transmural reentry in which the epicardium is an essential component of the circuit, lidocaine may interrupt the circuit by selectively rendering this component inexcitable. 
Intermittent pneumatic compression versus coumadin. Prevention of deep vein thrombosis in lower-extremity total joint arthroplasty. One hundred forty-nine consecutive patients requiring lower extremity total joint arthroplasty were randomized to either coumadin (52 patients) or intermittent pneumatic compression (48 patients) as prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Forty-nine patients were excluded. When fully ambulatory, the presence or absence of DVT was diagnosed by ascending venography (90% of patients), nuclear venography, venous dopplers, or impedence plethysmography. The two groups were similar in average age (64 years), indication for arthroplasty (pain because of arthritis in 90%), gender (98% male), and average number of risk factors (2.4). Twenty-five percent of patients on coumadin and 25% of patients on intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) developed DVT. IPC was more effective than coumadin following primary total hip arthroplasties (THAs) (16% versus 24% incidence DVT); coumadin was more effective than IPC following primary total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) (19% versus 32% incidence of DVT). DVT developed in 36% of patients following revision arthroplasty. Seventy-five percent of all thrombi were proximal. Both IPC and coumadin were found to be safe; there was no increased perioperative bleeding in the coumadin group. Of three postoperative deaths, one was possibly due to pulmonary embolism (PE). 
Cerebral hyperemia during spontaneous cluster headaches with excessive cerebral vasoconstriction to hyperoxia. Values for local cerebral blood flow (LCBF) were measured in three dimensions utilizing xenon enhanced computerized tomography among patients during spontaneously occurring cluster headaches, during headache-free intervals and immediately after terminating attacks by inhalation of 100% oxygen. Results were compared with values measured among age-matched normal volunteers. LCBF values measured in five cluster patients while headache-free did not differ from similar measures among age-matched normal volunteers. In three patients during attacks of spontaneously occurring cluster headache, LCBF values for temporal cortex, basal ganglia and subcortical white matter were increased. Immediately after terminating attacks of cluster by 100% oxygen inhalation for five minutes, LCBF values for temporal cortex and basal ganglia became significantly decreased below normal values in five patients with spontaneously occurring cluster headache. Prompt relief of head pain by inhalation of 100% oxygen is associated with abolition of the hyperperfusion of both cortical and subcortical brain structures that occurs during spontaneously occurring cluster headaches and is followed by excessive cerebrovascular constriction. It remains to be determined whether the cerebral hyperemia occurring during cluster headaches is causally related to the head pain or is secondary to the pain itself. Rapid termination of head pain by hyperoxia associated with excessive cerebral vasoconstriction suggests that this vascular phenomenon is unique to cluster headache and offers clues to its pathogenesis. 
Characterization of severely and profoundly hearing impaired adults attending an audiology clinic. Despite the fact that around 12 per cent of adult patients attending an audiology department will be severely hearing impaired (pure tone averages of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz of 70 dB HL or worse in the better hearing ear), their clinical and audiometric characteristics have not been well documented. These characteristics were collected prospectively in 132 adult patients attending a Severe Impairment Clinic, set up to manage their specific problems. The inability to provide sufficient masking makes audiometric assessment of the severity of the impairment uncertain in the poorer hearing ear in 52 per cent of these patients. In addition, the limited bone conduction output makes it almost invariably impossible to assess the masked bone conduction thresholds and hence the air-bone gap in the poorer ear. Hence, accurate characterization is only practical of the better hearing ear in such patients. In 67 per cent of the better hearing ears, there was a mixed hearing impairment, the air-bone gap being 20 dB or greater. The aetiology of the conductive component was almost equally otosclerosis and chronic otitis media. In only 19 per cent was the impairment of a pure sensorineural type, broken down as 6 per cent congenitally acquired, 5 per cent due to meningitis and 9 per cent being adult in onset. In the remaining 14 per cent of patients the type of impairment could not be classified as the bone conductive thresholds were off scale. Having had experience of managing these patients at a special clinic and knowing the workload involved, it is argued that consideration be given to setting up such clinics in most departments. 
An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 colitis associated with consumption of precooked meat patties. An outbreak of Escherichia coli O157:H7 hemorrhagic colitis at a Minnesota junior high school in October 1988 comprised 32 cases among 1562 students (attack rate, 2.0%). Four children were hospitalized; none developed hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Case children were more likely than controls to have eaten heat-processed meat patties (odds ratio, 6.2; 95% confidence interval, 2.0-20.1; P less than .001) in the school cafeteria on a specific day. The minimum estimated attack rate among students who ate these patties was 8%. The patties should have been sufficiently cooked by the manufacturer to destroy enteric pathogens before they were frozen and distributed. E. coli were cultured from frozen patties that were manufactured at the same plant on the same dates as the implicated patties, but serotype O157:H7 was not isolated. Heat-processed meat patties may serve as vehicles for E. coli O157:H7 infection, and currently there are no federal or state regulatory standards to ensure the safety of these products. 
Platelet-activating factor (PAF) stimulates the production of PAF acetylhydrolase by the human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. The human hepatoma cell line, HepG2, secreted an activity that degrades platelet-activating factor (PAF) by the hydrolysis of the sn-2 acetyl group. This activity was Ca++ independent, inhibited by diisopropylfluorophosphate but not by p-bromophenacyl bromide, and resistant to treatment with trypsin or pronase. Separation of HepG2-conditioned medium by gel filtration disclosed that the activity was associated with lipoproteins. An antiserum against PAF acetylhydrolase immunoprecipitated this activity. It was not recognized by an antibody against lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which also is secreted by HepG2 cells. Therefore the phospholipase A2 activity of LCAT was excluded as a source of the observed activity. PAF added to the culture medium stimulated the secretion of the PAF-degrading activity by HepG2 cells, while lyso-PAF was inactive. Maximal stimulation was observed with 5 ng/ml PAF, which induced a fivefold increase. The presence of 5 ng/ml PAF, enhanced the secretion of [35S]methionine-labeled PAF acetylhydrolase and cycloheximide inhibited both the basal and PAF-stimulated secretion of the labeled enzyme. We conclude that HepG2 cells produce PAF acetylhydrolase. The liver may be a major source of plasma PAF acetylhydrolase, and PAF may induce the production of its inactivating enzyme by the liver. 
Prognosis in familial non-polyposis colorectal cancer. Familial cases of non-polyposis colorectal cancer have attracted much interest but little is known of their natural history. Using a population based study we have determined whether a positive family history of bowel cancer is an independent prognostic factor. All patients under 55 years with histologically confirmed colorectal cancer in Northern Ireland during the period 1976-8 were studied. The family history was validated in 95% of all nonpolyposis cases (n = 205). Medical history or cause of death were verified for 98% of 1811 first degree relatives. The strength of the family history was assessed using a score that compares the mortality from bowel cancer in the family against the average population mortality, taking account of family size and age structure. The family history score was not predictive of survival neither in univariate analysis or in a Cox's proportional hazards multivariate analysis controlling for age, sex, stage, site, and duration of symptoms. In conclusion, a positive family history does not independently influence prognosis in patients with bowel cancer. 
Nephrogenic rests in Wilms tumor patients with the Drash syndrome. The histological specimens from 12 patients with the Drash syndrome were identified from the National Wilms Tumor Study Group and reviewed for the presence of nephrogenic rests. Of 7 patients with the complete Drash syndrome 6 were evaluable for nephrogenic rests, including 5 (83%) who demonstrated intralobar nephrogenic rests. Of 5 (80%) partial Drash syndrome cases 4 (80%) were also intralobar nephrogenic rest positive. Neither group had perilobar nephrogenic rests identified. In a control population of Wilms tumor patients without the Drash syndrome only 39 of 274 (14%) with unilateral tumor had intralobar nephrogenic rests identified, whereas 26 of 92 (28%) bilateral cases had intralobar nephrogenic rests. There was a significantly higher rate of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome cases than in the general Wilms tumor population (p less than 0.001). Wilms tumor patients with intralobar nephrogenic rests and the Drash syndrome present at a younger age and have a higher rate of bilaterality than rest negative Wilms tumor patients. The strong association of intralobar nephrogenic rests in the Drash syndrome approaches that found in the aniridia complex. However, in other syndromes associated with Wilms tumor, such as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and hemihypertrophy, there is a high prevalence of perilobar nephrogenic rests. In view of the high incidence of intralobar nephrogenic rests in complete and partial Drash syndrome patients, it is probable that events leading to Wilms tumor in patients with the Drash syndrome occur at an early stage in nephrogenesis. 
Carboxyhaemoglobin concentrations, pulse oximetry and arterial blood-gas tensions during jet ventilation for Nd-YAG laser bronchoscopy. Oxygen saturation measured with pulse oximetry (SpO2) is overestimated in the presence of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb). Smoke produced during laser resection of tracheobronchial malignancies may increase concentrations of COHb. We have measured COHb concentrations in 14 patients undergoing laser resection and compared SpO2 with functional oxygen saturation (SaO2) to ascertain if pulse oximetry is an accurate monitor of oxygen saturation. During the procedure frequent changes occur in ventilatory mechanics. Arterial blood-gas tensions were measured to see if gas exchange was satisfactory. Mean preoperative COHb was 1.4%. There was no significant change in COHb in any patient at any stage during treatment. The highest value was 2.05%. The mean difference between SaO2 and SpO2 was 1.13% (95% confidence interval 0.70-1.56%). Oxygen saturation may therefore safely be monitored by pulse oximetry in patients managed by our technique. Empirical setting of a jet ventilator provided acceptable blood-gas tensions, although sometimes it was necessary to increase the FlO2 to greater than 0.3 to maintain oxygenation. 
Immunologic abnormalities accompanying acute and chronic viral infections. A number of viral infections induce profound alterations in immune function; these changes may or may not be related to direct infection of lymphoid cells. The immunologic abnormalities that occur during acute systemic viral infections such as measles or infectious mononucleosis include suppression of responses to tuberculin skin tests in vivo and suppression of mitogen responses in vitro, evidence of activation of the immune system with up-regulation of activation-associated cell-surface markers and soluble cellular products, and evidence of altered immune regulation with autoimmune disease and elevated IgE. These abnormalities are likely to be interrelated and can become chronic when the viral infection is not cleared and persists. 
Children with pervasive refusal. Four children are described with a potentially life threatening condition manifested by profound and pervasive refusal to eat, drink, walk, talk, or care for themselves in any way over a period of several months. The multiplicity and severity of the symptoms in these children do not fit comfortably into any existing diagnostic category. Long term and highly skilled nursing and psychiatric care is required to help these children to recover. The possible causes of this syndrome are discussed. 
Optimal right ventricular filling pressures and the role of pericardial constraint in right ventricular infarction in dogs. BACKGROUND. Previous studies have reported an important role for right ventricular function in the pathophysiology of the low cardiac output state that can accompany right ventricular infarction. Some studies have suggested that right ventricular distensibility impairs right ventricular filling and stroke output; others have demonstrated that the pericardium can mediate depressed left ventricular filling and stroke output. METHODS AND RESULTS. To determine the role of pericardial constraint and optimal volume loading in an experimental model of right ventricular wall infarction, six mongrel dogs were studied before and after right ventricular wall infarction and after volume loading. The pericardium was then opened in two phases. In the first phase, the pericardium was opened partially to allow the atria to distend freely, and in the second phase, the pericardium was opened completely. The animals were preinstrumented with two sets of piezoelectric crystals attached to the right ventricular free wall, one in the infarct and the other in the noninfarct territory. Left ventricular size was estimated by left ventricular crystals on the anterior wall of the left ventricle. Right ventricular and left ventricular Millar catheters were used to assess intracavitary pressure, and a flat balloon was used to assess intrapericardial pressure. Right ventricular infarction reduced cardiac output by 23% and stroke volume by 30%. End-diastolic segment length and transmural pressure of the left ventricle decreased. Volume loading restored cardiac output to baseline values and was mediated by a significant increase in end-diastolic length in the noninfarct territory. This was achieved by increasing right ventricular end-diastolic pressure from 9 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 3 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Partial opening of the pericardium mediated significant increases in both end-diastolic segment lengths of the left ventricle and the noninfarct territory. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased slightly by 3 mm Hg (p = NS). Complete opening of the pericardium increased cardiac output and stroke volume and mediated a significant decrease in right and left ventricular end-diastolic pressures. Left ventricular transmural pressure and end-diastolic segment lengths of the left ventricle and the noninfarct territory increased. Left ventricular diastolic pressure-segment length relations were shifted upward by right ventricular infarction. A partial opening of the pericardium shifted this relation downward in all animals, and complete opening of the pericardium shifted the relation rightward and further downward. CONCLUSIONS. Cardiac output is restored to baseline values by volume loading sufficient to increase the right ventricular diastolic pressure to 16 +/- 3 mm Hg. Evidence of pericardial constraint was observed and appears to be mediated by an atrioventricular interaction in addition to the direct ventricular interaction. 
Limb-sparing surgery in skeletally immature patients with osteosarcoma. The use of an expandable prosthesis. Limb-sparing surgery has a definite role in the treatment of osteosarcoma in children. Increased survival, however, raises problems of limb-length discrepancy and prosthetic longevity. The concept of an expandable adjustable prosthesis addresses the problem of leg-length discrepancy. The problem of prosthesis longevity will require further long-term evaluation of current designs and methods of fixation, as well as the development of a permanent prosthesis or biologic replacement. At skeletal maturity, the expandable prosthesis may either be maintained or substituted with another implant or biological alternative if warranted by the clinical situation. 
Peripheral arterial occlusion in infants--a report of two cases treated conservatively. The occlusion of major arteries in newborns is usually associated with catheterization of the umbilical vessels. It occurs very rarely instead as a primary disorder, and the cause is still unclear. We present two new cases of newborns with this type of disease, which were resolved with the only medical treatment. The literature is reviewed, and the usefulness of the different diagnostic procedures is discussed. 
Calcium channel autoantibodies in the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. We have tested 36 patients with the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome for serum antibodies to voltage-gated calcium channels by using an immunoprecipitation assay with [125I] omega-conotoxin-labeled voltage-gated calcium channels extracted from a human neuroblastoma cell line, SKN-SH. Forty-four percent of these patients had significant levels of antibody (30-1,466 pM) compared with healthy control individuals (less than 15 pM). The incidence of positive sera in patients without associated small cell lung carcinoma (61%) was greater than in those patients with small cell lung carcinoma (28%). Results correlated strongly with results obtained using voltage-gated calcium channels extracted from the small cell lung carcinoma line, MAR5. Anti-voltage-gated calcium channel antibody titers did not correlate with disease severity across individuals, but longitudinal studies in 2 patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy showed a clear inverse relation between antibody titer and an electromyographic index of disease severity. The incidence of positive sera among patients with other neurological disorders was not significant, but 8 of 12 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus had raised titers (30-82 pM). We conclude that the antibodies detected in this assay are heterogeneous and that some of them are likely to be implicated in this disorder of neuromuscular transmission. The assay should prove useful as an additional diagnostic aid in patients with Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome. 
Noninvasive diagnostic assessment of peripheral vascular disease. Noninvasive techniques have assumed an increasingly important role in the management of patients with vascular disease. Both ultrasonic and plethysmographic instruments allow objective evaluation of vascular disorders by the measurement of segmental limb blood pressures, analysis of blood velocity disturbances, recording of digit or limb pulse waveforms, or imaging of vascular disease, with or without Doppler flow analysis or color-flow mapping. These techniques have been applied for screening asymptomatic individuals, diagnosis of symptomatic patients, monitoring of interventional or surgical procedures, and follow-up of the natural history or the efficacy of medical, interventional, or surgical therapy of vascular disease. This article reviews the clinical application of these modalities to patients with peripheral arterial disease and briefly discusses cost-effectiveness and potential abuses of noninvasive technology. 
The role of radiology in evaluation of the failing renal transplantation. Renal allograft transplantation frequently is the optimal treatment for patients in renal failure. This review discusses the current status of renal transplantation, emphasizing the medical and surgical processes that can interfere with normal renal function. Although many insults to the renal allograft are nonspecific, a logical approach to the identification of the decrease in renal function and appropriate treatment can be suggested by some imaging procedures. 
Abnormalities of gastrointestinal motility in children with nonulcer dyspepsia and in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease. In 11 children (mean age 44.2 months) with symptoms suggesting upper intestinal dysfunction (nonulcer dyspepsia), in nine children (mean age 27.3 months) with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease, and in seven controls (mean age 20.4 months) we investigated fasting [for 3 hr or until two migrating motor complexes (MMC) were observed] and fed (90 min) antroduodenal motility by means of perfused catheter system; furthermore, we measured both gastric emptying of a radiolabeled milk formula and fasting duodenogastric reflux during manometry by assessing bile salt concentration in gastric aspirates. No structural abnormalities of gastrointestinal tract and organic disorders were detected in the patients. In a high proportion of both groups of patients we found manometric abnormalities of interdigestive and fed motor patterns that were not seen in the controls: absence of antral phase III of MMC; significant decrease of antral and/or duodenal motor activity during fasting and/or fed periods; abnormal propagation or configuration of MMC phase III that was significantly shorter than in controls; bursts of sustained fasting and/or fed phasic duodenal activity, frequently uncoordinated with adjacent gut segments. When compared to controls, the mean intragastric concentration of bile salts during all MMC phases and the mean 1-hr percent gastric activity of the radiolabeled milk were significantly higher in the two groups of patients. We conclude that in a high proportion of children with nonulcer dyspepsia and of children with GER disease, gastrointestinal manometry may reveal significant irregularities of antral and duodenal motility, which are associated with increased duodenogastric reflux and delayed gastric emptying. 
Interleukin 6 activity in infants and children with bacterial meningitis. The Collaborative Study on Meningitis. Concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of infants and children with bacterial meningitis were determined and correlations were sought with other indices of inflammation and with outcome. Forty-two patients ages 1 month to 15 years (mean, 2.5 years) were studied. IL-6 activity was detectable (greater than 50 units/ml) in 30 of 36 CSF samples collected at admission from patients with meningitis and in 1 of 23 controls with fever and normal CSF findings. Mean values were 36,000 units/ml (range, 151-156,000). IL-6 activity in CSF persisted during the first 5 days of illness. IL-6 concentrations at admission were not associated with clinical findings, CSF leukocyte, protein and glucose concentrations, serum C-reactive protein concentration and neurologic complications or sequelae. IL-6 was also detected in the serum of 3 of 14 patients with meningitis and in 0 of 7 controls with no infectious disease. The presence of IL-6 was not associated with bacteremia or with duration of fever before admission. The presence of IL-6 in the CSF of pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis is in accordance with available data on other cytokines and suggests their role as mediators of meningeal inflammation. 
Seasonal variation in growth during growth hormone therapy. Seasonal variation in growth of normal children has been well described, although the mechanism by which it occurs has not been elucidated. The growth of 52 growth hormone-deficient children treated with synthetic human growth hormone was analyzed. A similar seasonal variation was observed, with mean (+/- SEM) peak growth occurring in the summer (8.2 +/- 0.3 cm/y) and winter (7.7 +/- 0.2 cm/y), and trough growth occurring in the autumn (6.9 +/- 0.3 cm/y). Forty-seven percent of subjects grew minimally during the autumn, and only two children showed peak growth in that season. Individual variations between maximal and minimal growth seasons amounted to 3.5 +/- 0.3 cm/y. The seasonal pattern was statistically significant for the group as a whole, for the prepubertal subgroup, and for the boys. The variation persisted when the first year of treatment was excluded to avoid bias of the initial growth spurt. The season of onset of therapy did not affect total growth during the first year. The demonstration of a seasonal pattern in growth of these children suggests that the seasonal variation may be mediated by peripheral rather than central factors. Paired clonidine-provoked growth hormone levels and an integrated concentration of 24-hour growth hormone levels and serum levels of insulinlike growth hormone I measured in a control group of normally growing children were also analyzed and showed no seasonal variation. This further suggests that peripheral rather than central factors are responsible for the seasonal variation in children's growth. 
Erythropoietic protoporphyria: unusual skin and neurological problems after liver transplantation. The case of a woman with protoporphyria who developed liver failure and underwent liver transplantation is described. During the pretransplant episode of liver failure she developed quadriparesis that rapidly progressed after transplantation to a severe polyneuropathy. Following transplantation she also developed a second-degree burn of the light-exposed abdominal wall. The neuropathy resembled that observed in other forms of porphyria, and it is proposed that the extreme disturbance of protoporphyrin levels associated with protoporphyrin-induced liver failure caused this neuropathy. Such a neuropathy has not previously been described in protoporphyria. Erythrocyte protoporphyrin levels remain high and fecal levels normal, although results of liver tests are normal. She remains photosensitive, which emphasizes that although liver transplantation may be lifesaving in this disorder, it is not curative, and care must be taken to prevent photosensitive damage to skin and light-exposed internal organs. 
Clinical course of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in children Previous studies in adults with dilated cardiomyopathy suggest that the presence of arrhythmia, especially ventricular tachycardia, correlates with increased mortality. We performed a retrospective analysis of 63 children with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy to determine the prognostic significance of arrhythmias and other findings with respect to mortality. The mean age at diagnosis of the cardiomyopathy was 4.96 +/- 5.3 years. The overall mortality rate was 16% over a 10 year follow-up period. Persistent congestive heart failure and ST-T wave changes correlated with increased mortality (p less than 0.05). No other variables affected outcome. Arrhythmias were found in 46% of the patients; of the arrhythmias, 48% were atrial arrhythmias. Ventricular tachycardia was present in six patients. Death occurred in 4 (14%) of 29 patients with known arrhythmia; 1 of the 5 died suddenly. The remaining 6 deaths in the series occurred in the 34 patients without a documented arrhythmia. It is concluded that 1) arrhythmias are frequently seen in children with dilated cardiomyopathy but are not predictive of outcome; 2) sudden death in children with this disease is rare; and 3) persistent congestive heart failure portends a poor prognosis. 
Intrascrotal adenomatoid tumors. Adenomatoid tumors are regarded as uncommon neoplasms of the paratesticular tissues, probably of mesothelial origin. The majority of cases reported have involved the epididymis. We report our experience with 8 cases of testicular tumors and 11 of epididymal adenomatoid tumors during a 13-year period, and review the relevant literature. The incidence of adenomatoid tumors relative to all tumors in the testis was 6.9% (8 of 116), exceeding that of Leydig cell tumors, which were previously believed to be the most common benign testicular neoplasms. The adenomatoid tumors included 38% epididymal tumors (11 of 29). The clinical course of the tumors was benign, without recurrences. Local excision is regarded as the treatment of choice for epididymal and testicular adenomatoid tumors. 
Microbiological analysis of sepsis complicating non-surgical biliary drainage in malignant obstruction. Cholangitis with sepsis is a common complication of non-surgical biliary drainage and represents a difficult management problem. Microbiological data for 18 septic episodes in 15 patients following endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD) and 14 septic episodes in 14 patients following percutaneous transhepatic drainage (PTD) were reviewed. In the EBD group, all 18 patient episodes of sepsis had blood cultures and 10 had bile cultures obtained. In total, 17 gram-negative isolates and 5 gram-positive isolates were grown in the EBD sepsis group. All of the 14 PTD patients had bile cultures and 13 had blood cultures. In total, 23 gram-negative isolates and 26 gram-positive isolates were grown in the PTD sepsis group. When PTD cultures were compared with EBD cultures, there were significantly more gram-positive cultures (26 vs. 5) associated with PTD sepsis than EBD sepsis (p less than 0.0005). Analysis of the antibiotic sensitivities revealed that a combination of ticarcillin clavulanate with gentamicin covered 20 of the 22 (91%) EBD organisms and 38 of the 49 (78%) PTD organisms. Based on this data, ticarcillin clavulanate with gentamicin is the therapy of choice for EBD and PTD sepsis at our institution. 
Traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm: a case report. A case of traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (CCF) associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is reported. A 42-year-old man developed traumatic CCF after severe head trauma. Cerebral angiography demonstrated a direct CCF associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm at the C2 portion. Transarterial balloon embolization of the CCF caused severe subarachnoid hemorrhage. A CCF with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is life-threatening and requires emergency treatment. However, balloon occlusion in such cases is contraindicated because of possible rupture of a pseudoaneurysm. Trapping or a direct surgical approach is the treatment of choice. 
Contractile properties of lower leg muscles are normal in Parkinson's disease. Contraction parameters (time-to-peak and half relaxation time), responses to short tetani and resistance to stretch were studied in the lower leg muscles of Parkinsonian patients and in age-matched controls. It was possible to distinguish between muscle groups of different fibre type composition in normal subjects on the basis of their contraction and relaxation velocities. These parameters, however, failed to show any abnormalities in the patient group. The only abnormal finding in Parkinsonian subjects was an increased resistance to passive stretch under static conditions, presumably elastic in origin. The results are evidence against a contribution of altered contractile properties to muscular rigidity in Parkinsonism. 
Hazards of mattresses, beds and bedding in deaths of infants. Of 52 infants who had died suddenly and were referred to autopsy, nine had lain on adult water beds for the first time; five had died as a result of accidents; two had died on water beds; two were in beds with widely spaced slats; and one had died as a result of strangulation. Three deaths were due to overlying. Three other infants had been placed on sheepskin rugs for the first time and were found dead shortly thereafter. These infants ranged in age from 2 to 9 months, except for a severely mentally retarded nine-year-old with spastic paraplegia. We believe that a general warning should be issued concerning water beds and that soft bedding should not be used for infants. Infants should not be placed unattended or left to sleep on water beds; only beds recommended for infants should be used. Overlying of a young infant is most likely to occur on a water bed, or if the parent is obese or has consumed alcohol. 
Prevalence of proximal faecal stasis in active ulcerative colitis. Proximal faecal stasis may occur when faecal matter accumulates in the uninflamed colon above an area of active ulcerative colitis. This phenomenon is thought to be the cause of symptoms in some patients with distal disease. It is not known, however, how often patients with active distal colitis exhibit slow colonic transit. Fifty two consecutive patients with active ulcerative colitis each ingested 10 radio-opaque markers nightly for 14 days. Minimum colonic transit times were derived from counts of retained markers shown by plain abdominal radiography on the 15th day. The transit times for each patient were related to their disease extent and bowel frequency. Four patients had colonic transit times greater than one week and two others had evidence of relative stasis. The results indicate that approximately 10% of attacks of distal colitis are associated with faecal stasis. 
Ureteral obstruction after abdominal aortic surgery. Obstructive uropathy following abdominal aortic surgery can no longer be considered a rarity. Early hydronephrosis, developing in the first postoperative year, occurs in 10% to 20% of patients; it usually runs a benign, self-limiting course. The incidence of delayed ureteral obstruction, which develops or persists after the first postoperative year, is unknown because it is asymptomatic in most cases. Although spontaneous resolution is possible, it seems that this late form is more likely to persist. The diagnosis of postoperative hydronephrosis is not an indication for urologic intervention. This should seldom be necessary; it should be reserved only for patients with evidence of worsening obstruction or deteriorating renal function. Early and particularly, delayed hydronephrosis seems to be a marker for present or impending graft complications, such as infection or false aneurysms. A prolonged follow-up is therefore mandatory whenever the diagnosis is established as it may improve long-term survival and limb salvage. The need for routine screening for this condition remains to be established. With the availability of noninvasive methods, such a task could be easily accomplished. 
Reversible inactivation of the insular cortex by tetrodotoxin produces retrograde and anterograde amnesia for inhibitory avoidance and spatial learning. Tetrodotoxin (TTX; a voltage-sensitive sodium channel blocker) was microinjected bilaterally into the insular (IC), frontal (FC), or parietal (PC) cortex or the ventral caudate nucleus of rats either before or after they were trained in an inhibitory avoidance task. When administered either before or after training, injections of TTX into the IC impaired performance on a 48-hr retention test. Injections of TTX into the PC also impaired retention when administered before training. One week later, rats with cannulae in the IC, FC, and PC received microinjections of TTX either before or after training in a water maze (Morris) spatial learning task and retention was tested 24 hr later. TTX impaired retention when administered to the IC either before or after training. These findings indicate that a functionally intact IC during and after training in these tasks appears to be essential for the storage of long-term memory. 
Antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media. No single antimicrobial drug is best suited for all patients with AOM. Amoxicillin and TMP-SMZ, however, remain first-line drugs in the initial treatment of uncomplicated AOM in the non-neonate. In other situations the drug selected depends on the patient's age, associated illnesses, recent history of otitis media, and drug hypersensitivity. Pharmacokinetic studies of AOM treatment are essential in generating more precise recommendations for antimicrobial drug use. 
The high risk of death by alcohol related diseases in subjects diagnosed as diabetic and impaired glucose tolerant: the Paris Prospective Study after 15 years of follow-up. The 15 year mortality rates and causes of death are reported for the Paris Prospective Study cohort of 7180 working men, aged between 44 and 55 years who attended the first follow-up examination. All subjects were classified as normoglycaemic, impaired glucose tolerant or diabetic according to the WHO criteria, following an oral glucose tolerance test. The relative risks of death in comparison to the normoglycaemic group were 1.6 for impaired glucose tolerant and 2.3 for diabetic subjects; for death due to coronary heart disease: 1.7 and 2.3 respectively; for death due to alcohol and cirrhosis: 7.0 and 13.3 respectively. It appears that in this cohort a proportion of subjects screened as diabetic have impaired liver function and disturbed carbohydrate metabolism, due to excessive alcohol consumption. Alcohol should be investigated as a possible risk factor for diabetes, particularly in epidemiological studies where diabetes is diagnosed by the oral glucose tolerance test and the population has a high consumption of alcohol. 
Reversal of a dense, persistent, holohemispheric neurological deficit after an endarterectomy of the carotid artery: case report. The role and timing of a carotid endarterectomy in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke-in-evolution remain controversial. Although computed tomographic (CT) scans typically show no abnormalities in the acute stage, it is generally agreed that a dense neurological deficit (hemiplegia) and/or multiple modality neurological disturbance (involving motor, sensory, gaze, and visual field impairment) represent contraindications to surgical intervention. We present a case of an acute right holohemispheric neurological deficit including dense hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, gaze disturbance, hemineglect, and impaired level of consciousness. This persisted for 4 days while serial CT scans showed no evidence of infarction. Angiography revealed pre-occlusive stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with sluggish antegrade flow. The anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis were impaired, and the right middle cerebral artery territory filled via the posterior communicating artery. Despite the dense neurological deficit persisting for 4 days, a carotid endarterectomy was performed. Gradual neurological improvement was noted within hours of the operation, and all neurological deficits resolved within the subsequent 3 days. This case is consistent with prolonged holohemispheric hemodynamic compromise below the threshold of neurological dysfunction, but above the threshold of tissue infarction ("idling neurons"). Features assisting in the recognition of this unusual scenario and the indications and risks of revascularization in this setting are discussed. 
A phase II study of high-dose continuous infusion interleukin-2 with lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with metastatic melanoma. Thirty-three patients with metastatic melanoma were treated in a phase II study with an intravenous continuous infusion (IVCI) of interleukin-2 (IL2) given with lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. The dose of IL2 was the optimal priming dose for LAK-cell induction, followed by the maximally tolerated LAK-cell dose that could be given by an IVCI schedule as determined by a previous phase I trial. The CI schedule was chosen for evaluation because of a postulated reduction in toxicity with the possibility of administering a more prolonged IL2 infusion and because greater rebound lymphocytosis and LAK-cell generation had been reported using this dose and schedule. The 33 patients were similar in age, performance status, and sites of disease to those treated in previous IL2 trials. All patients were assessable for response and toxicity. One patient (3%) achieved a partial response of 10 months duration. There were no other clinically significant responses. Significant toxicity included hypotension requiring pressors (45%), dyspnea (36%), renal insufficiency (24%), hepatic dysfunction (66%), and cardiac arrhythmias (18%). These toxicities reversed with cessation of the infusion. There were four deaths during the first 30 days of treatment, three from infection (one related to central line, one related to LAK cells, one related to tumor), and one from tumor-related hemorrhage. Toxicity was unexpectedly high and at least comparable to that seen in previous studies using a high-dose IV bolus schedule of IL2. When comparing the IVCI schedule with high-dose bolus IL2 to LAK cells in nonrandomized but sequential studies in patients with advanced melanoma, it appears that CI IL2 is less efficacious. 
Lower limb problems in diabetic patients. What are the causes? What are the remedies? Peripheral neuropathy, infection, and peripheral vascular disease can produce serious problems in diabetic patients, particularly in the lower limbs. Ulceration of the foot may progress to gangrene and ultimately necessitate amputation. Distal symmetric polyneuropathy causes sensory loss. Such loss in patients with peripheral vascular disease creates a high risk for foot ulcers, which are vulnerable to infection. Treatment includes relief of neuropathic pain and antibiotic therapy for infection. Pentoxifylline (Trental) improves microvascular flow and appears to be effective against peripheral vascular disease. Aldose reductase inhibitors are being investigated as therapy for diabetic neuropathy. Prevention is the mainstay of management in these patients. Patient education is essential to help maintain health and prevent the potential adverse effects of diabetes. 
Incremental prognostic value of exercise hemodynamic variables in chronic congestive heart failure secondary to coronary artery disease or to dilated cardiomyopathy. To determine the prognostic value of hemodynamic variables at rest and during exercise, 49 patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing hemodynamic evaluation at rest and during symptom-limited exercise were followed for 1 year. One-year mortality rate was 33%. On univariate analysis, nonsurvivors differed significantly from survivors in pulmonary arterial wedge pressure at rest (22 +/- 10 vs 15 +/- 10 mm Hg; p = 0.01) and during exercise (32 +/- 9 vs 24 +/- 9 mm Hg; p = 0.003), stroke work index at rest (19 +/- 6 vs 25 +/- 9 g-m/m2; p = 0.03) and during exercise (20 +/- 7 vs 32 +/- 14 g-m/m2; p = 0.001) and exercise-induced increment in stroke work index (0.5 +/- 0.4 vs 7 +/- 8 g-m/m2; p = 0.004), but not with respect to left ventricular ejection fraction, exercise duration, peak oxygen consumption or peak left ventricular hydraulic power. Patients with a peak exercise stroke work index less than 20 g-m/m2 had a 66% mortality rate compared with a mortality rate of 13% in patients with a peak exercise stroke work index greater than 20 g-m/m2 (p = 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identified pulmonary arterial wedge pressure at rest and peak exercise stroke work index as the only independent predictors of mortality. A receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that peak exercise stroke work index provided significant incremental prognostic information over the resting hemodynamic variables. 
Unusual initial calcification of primary and metastatic seminomas. Detection by computed tomography. Rare large ab initio calcifications of a primary mediastinal seminoma in a 16-year-old boy and of para-aortic nodal metastatic ovarian seminoma in a 14-year-old girl are demonstrated with CT but not with conventional radiography. They are most likely dystrophic calcifications because of the absence of other germ cell tumor components and infective granulomatous disease. Routine use of CT might detect more such calcifications in untreated seminoma. 
Assessment of factors influencing the outcome of radiotherapy for bladder cancer. The results of treatment of 709 patients with carcinoma of the bladder are reported. Inclusion of the pelvic lymph nodes in the treatment volume failed to lead to any improvement in survival. The factors influencing survival were stage, tumour histology and differentiation. The presence of tumour at follow-up cystoscopy at 3 months was of great prognostic significance. 
Urological manifestations of the Melnick-Needles syndrome: a case report and review of the literature. In 1966 Melnick and Needles described a syndrome of multiple skeletal anomalies in a 3-year-old girl. A dilated ureter was noted but not associated with the disorder. Subsequent to this report there have been 8 additional cases published of patients with the Melnick-Needles syndrome in association with a variety of urogenital and abdominal wall abnormalities. A 10-year-old girl with this syndrome and bilateral ureteral ectasia is described and the literature on this association is reviewed. 
Poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with lymphoid stroma (lymphoepithelioma-like carcinomas) of the stomach. Report of three cases with Epstein-Barr virus genome demonstrated by the polymerase chain reaction. Lymphoepithelioma of the nasopharynx is an undifferentiated carcinoma with prominent lymphoid infiltration. Histologically similar tumors have been documented in the skin, lung, thymus, salivary gland, tonsil, and uterine cervix. The authors report three cases of gastric carcinoma that were histologically and immunohistochemically similar to lymphoepithelioma. The patients were elderly white persons (61, 76, and 77 years of age); two of them had previous partial gastric resections for benign ulcer disease. The tumors were located on the lesser gastric curvature (two cases) and at a previous anastomotic site (one case) and measured 3, 4, and 7 cm in largest dimension. Grossly, each neoplasm was a raised plaque-like lesion with a central ulcer. Microscopically, all three tumors were similar, with poorly differentiated polygonal tumor cells scattered throughout a dense lymphocytic background. In a few areas, tumor cells formed ill-defined cords. In two cases, the neoplasms invaded the gastric muscle layer but had a well-delineated (pushing) margin. The tumor cells were immunohistochemically positive for AE3-defined keratin, confirming their epithelial nature. The lymphocytes were a mixture of UCHL-1-positive T cells and L-26-positive B cells. Portions of the Epstein-Barr virus genome were present in all cases, as detected by the polymerase chain reaction. The morphologic features of these cases are similar to those of lymphoepithelioma in other anatomic sites, and these tumors represent a unique subtype of gastric carcinoma. 
Practice patterns in the treatment of acutely ill hospitalized asthmatic patients at three teaching hospitals. Variability in resource utilization. STUDY OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the extent to which patterns of diagnostic and therapeutic practice differ among hospitals caring for acutely ill hospitalized asthmatic patients in a single city. DESIGN: Our study comprised a retrospective review of the records of patients admitted to the hospital for the treatment of acute asthma. SETTING: Three large teaching hospitals in Boston were the setting. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty-seven patients between 18 and 50 years of age who were admitted to the medical services specifically for the treatment of asthma were studied. INTERVENTIONS: There were no interventions. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For this group of patients with similar histories of asthma, clinical presentation, and severity of asthma, the diagnostic tests used within 12 hours of admission and the frequency and volume of diagnostic laboratory testing throughout the admission differed significantly among the three hospitals. Spirometry, the test bearing most directly on the severity of the asthmatic attack, was not used routinely as a criterion for admission or discharge at any of the hospitals. Other tests of uncertain efficacy, such as chest x-ray films, were used frequently at some of the hospitals. Patients at all three hospitals were treated similarly with intensive combined regimens of methylxanthines, sympathomimetics, and corticosteroids and had similar mean lengths of stay. The use of chest physical therapy, which has not yet been demonstrated to be effective in acute asthma, differed significantly among the three hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that considerable variability exists in the diagnostic evaluation of acutely ill hospitalized asthmatic patients in the three hospitals; little variability exists in the pharmacologic treatment of these patients. In the absence of data on outcome regarding functional improvement and reductions in morbidity, we are unable to recommend a preferred pattern of practice from this study. 
Correlation of emergency health care use, 911 volume, and jail activity with welfare check distribution. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship among emergency health care use, 911 call volume, and jail admissions with the timing of the distribution of General Assistance, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and Minnesota Supplemental Aid welfare checks. DESIGN: This was a retrospective study analyzing previously collected census and welfare check distribution data. SETTING: The data used in this study were obtained from the Hennepin County Medical Center, the Hennepin County jail and alcoholic receiving center, and Department of Economic Assistance. INTERVENTIONS: The daily census for the years 1986 through 1988 in the Hennepin County Medical Center emergency department, ED resuscitation room, pediatric ED, crisis intervention center, urgent care center, and alcoholic receiving center was obtained. The numbers of daily ambulance runs, nonelective hospital admissions, Hennepin County 911 calls, and Hennepin County jail admissions for the same years also were obtained. Means for each day of the month were computed across the 36 months of observation. These data were correlated with the number of days elapsed since the monthly issuance of the General Assistance, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, and Minnesota Supplemental Aid welfare checks. MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS: There were significant correlations between the number of days after distribution of the checks and the average values of the census of the alcoholic receiving center (r = -.96, P less than .00001), the ED (r = -.80, P less than .0001), ambulance runs (r = -.68, P less than .0001), 911 calls (r = -.45, P = .01), jail admissions (r = -.45, P = .01), nonelective hospital admissions (r = -.44, P = .01), and the crisis intervention center visits (r = -.39, P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that scheduling and staffing practices of various emergency service areas in Hennepin County reflect patient load variation associated with time of welfare check distribution. Systematic variation of time or amount of welfare could lead to improved distribution and reduction of emergency services demand. 
Intraoperative radiation therapy for recurrent head and neck cancer. Forty-seven patients with recurrent head and neck cancer in a previously irradiated field were treated with surgical resection and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). Recurrent disease occurred at a median of 18 months from primary treatment, and was at the primary tumor site in 31 and metastatic to regional lymph nodes in 16. Recurrences were squamous cell carcinomas in 42 and adenoid cystic in five. Surgical resection left microscopic residual disease in 41 and gross residual in six. All patients received IORT with a median of 20 Gy. Two-year actuarial survival is 54.9%, and 15 patients are alive and disease free with a median survival of 29 months. Two-year actuarial local control is 61.5%. A trend toward increased survival (P less than 0.09) and local recurrence control (P = 0.05) was noticed when treating microscopic residual disease as opposed to gross residual disease. Perioperative mortality was seen in 8.5% and there was no increase in morbidity secondary to IORT. The authors believe that surgical resection and IORT is an effective treatment modality for head and neck cancers recurrent in previously irradiated fields and is adaptable to tertiary care hospitals. 
When should patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmia resume driving? An analysis of state regulations and physician practices. Most states have specific laws governing whether patients with seizure disorders can drive. To learn whether similar laws exist for patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmias, we surveyed the Departments of Motor Vehicles in all 50 states. In addition, either an arrhythmia specialist (n = 25) or a general cardiologist (n = 25) was chosen randomly from each state and interviewed to study physician awareness of such laws and physician attitudes toward driving by patients with arrhythmias. Forty-two states (84%) have laws restricting driving by patients who have seizures; only 8 states (16%) have specific laws for patients with arrhythmias. No state makes a distinction between driving by patients with arrhythmias who are managed with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) compared with patients who are managed medically. Seventy-four percent of physicians did not know their own state's laws about driving by patients who have ventricular arrhythmias. Cardiologists were more likely to advise no driving restriction for medically treated patients than for ICD-treated patients. Cardiologists were also more likely to advise permanent restriction for patients with ICDs than for patients treated medically. We conclude that greater legal and medical consensus is needed to guide physicians in advising patients with lethal ventricular arrhythmias about driving restrictions. 
Occurrence of p53 gene abnormalities in gastric carcinoma tumors and cell lines. We explored the state of the p53 gene in gastric cancer. Using one or more methods, we examined 15 specimens from primary carcinomas (14 tumors, one cell line), five cell lines derived from metastases, and seven paired samples of nonmalignant gastric mucosa. Sequence analyses of complementary DNA containing the entire p53 gene open reading frame demonstrated abnormalities in one of five samples from primary tumors and in all five samples from metastases. The single cell line derived from a primary carcinoma had no abnormality of the gene. The six abnormalities included four point mutations, one base-pair deletion resulting in a frame shift, and a 24 base-pair deletion caused by an intronic point mutation (as determined by sequence analysis of genomic DNA). Four of the six mutations mapped to regions highly conserved among species or involved in simian virus 40 T-antigen binding. Restriction fragment length polymorphism studies confirmed that chromosome 17p allelic deletions occur only in a minority of primary tumors, but that they may occur more frequently in metastases. Northern blotting and ribonuclease protection assays detected only a fraction of the p53 gene abnormalities detected by sequencing. Our findings indicate that mutations of the p53 gene are relatively rare in primary gastric tumors but appear to be relatively frequent in cell lines derived from metastatic lesions. Our results may help in understanding the molecular events associated with progression and metastasis in gastric carcinoma. 
Comparison of the clinical pharmacology of (-)NPA and levodopa in Parkinson's disease. Direct acting dopamine agonists are generally less effective than levodopa in relieving symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In an attempt to quantitate and explain this situation, the acute motor responses to intravenous injections of the dopamine agonist, (-)-N-n-propyl-norapomorphine hydrochloride (NPA), were compared with those of the dopamine precursor, levodopa. At optimum dose levels, the acute anti-Parkinsonian efficacy of NPA averaged only about 50% of maximum, while essentially total symptom suppression was obtained with levodopa in patients previously treated with the amine precursor. Dyskinesia severity, however, was similar with the two drugs. These differences in anti-Parkinsonian efficacy may reflect the fact that while NPA acts mainly on D-2 dopamine receptors, levodopa results in stimulation of both the D-1 and D-2 subsets of receptors at a more physiological ratio. Future efforts to develop dopamine agonists for the treatment of Parkinsonian symptoms may thus have to consider focusing on drugs having pharmacological profile more similar to that of dopamine. 
Diagnostic and prognostic importance of comparing the initial to the previous electrocardiogram in patients admitted for suspected acute myocardial infarction. Two hundred fifty-eight patients were admitted to the hospital for suspected acute myocardial infarction. Electrocardiograms recorded on admission (initial ECG) and the most recent available electrocardiogram recorded before admission (previous ECG) were compared to determine whether changes from the previous to initial ECG predicted acute myocardial infarction or complications of coronary artery disease. Initial ECGs were classed as either positive or negative, with positive indicating either infarction, injury, ischemia, strain, left ventricular hypertrophy, left bundle branch block, or paced rhythm. Negative ECGs were those that did not include any of the positive criteria. Positive and negative ECGs were subgrouped as showing change or no change from previous ECG. We found that patients with a negative initial ECG that had changed from the previous ECG had a 2.1 times greater risk for requiring interventions than those patients whose ECGs were unchanged. We also found that patients with a positive initial ECG that had changed from the previous ECG had a greater risk for interventions (2.0 times), complications (2.6 times), life-threatening complications (4.2 times), and acute myocardial infarction (6.6 times) than the sum of patients in all other ECG categories. We conclude that change is a useful predictor for interventions in patients with negative initial ECGs and a useful predictor for interventions, complications, and acute myocardial infarction in patients with positive initial ECGs. 
Clues and pitfalls in stereotactic biopsy of the central nervous system. We present a 6-year experience on 307 stereotactic biopsy specimens of the central nervous system using Leksell's and Talairach's systems independently and either Leksell or Sedan needles. Patients with deep cerebral lesions (basal ganglia, parasellar, pineal, or third ventricle), those located in highly functional areas or those poorly defined on imaging studies, as well as candidates for brachytherapy, were selected. Smear examination during surgery was a routine procedure followed by conventional histologic methods. Ages ranged from 8 months to 81 years (mean, 33.64 years). The series comprised 258 tumors, 28 nonneoplastic cases, and 21 nondiagnostic samples. Of the 258 tumors, 179 were supratentorial, 28 were infratentorial, 36 were of the pineal area, and 15 were from sellar and suprasellar regions. Results of the histologic examination showed the following: astrocytic tumors, 148 (57.36%); oligodendroglial, 25 (9.68%); ependymal, six (2.32%); primitive neuroectodermal tumors, 17, including 14 pineoblastomas (5.45%) and three medulloblastomas (1.16%), seven lymphomas (2.71%), seven meningiomas (2.71%), four schwannomas (1.55%), eight craniopharyngiomas (3.10%), 12 germinomas (4.65%), and 20 metastases (7.78%). Nontumoral cases included six arteriovenous malformations, six pyogenic lesions, seven infarcts, two hematomas, one multiple sclerosis plaque, one Fahr, one progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, one tuberculosis, one cysticercosis, and one Chagas' encephalitis. Awareness of the cerebellar granular layer in infratentorial targets as well as glial reaction around craniopharyngiomas is essential to avoid misdiagnosis. Difficulties were basically differential diagnosis between well-differentiated astrocytomas vs glial reaction, as well as poorly differentiated neoplasms vs metastases. 
Recombinant interferon beta: a phase I-II trial in children with recurrent brain tumors. A multicenter phase I-II trial of intravenous (IV) human recombinant interferon beta (rIFN-beta; Betaseron; Triton Bioscience Inc, Almeda, CA) was conducted in children with recurrent or progressive primary brain and spinal cord tumors. A total of 29 patients were enrolled: high-grade astrocytoma (12), brainstem glioma (nine), and primitive neuroectadermal tumor (three), ependymoma (two), germ cell (two), and spinal cord astrocytoma (one). Betaseron was given by IV infusion over 30 minutes 3 times per week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday [MWF]). Four dose levels were studied, and at least three patients were entered at each dose level. The treatment plan began with a three-step dose escalation for each patient over 6 weeks (initiation phase). The dose-escalation schema for the four dose levels was: 50-100-200, 100-200-400, 200-300-500, and 300-400-600 x 10(6) (M) IU/m2. Patients experiencing an objective response or stable disease after 6 weeks entered the maintenance phase at the final escalated dose, ie, 200, 400, 500, or 600 mlU/m2 (MWF). Common transient effects included chills, fever, and fatigue. Dose-limiting toxicities were hematologic, hepatic, and CNS. The maintenance maximum-tolerable dose (MTD) was 500 mlU/m2, ie, dose level 3. Response was assessed at completion of the initiation phase and at 2-month intervals during the maintenance phase. Objective partial responses were seen in patients with high-grade astrocytoma (two) and brain-stem glioma (two). Thus, four of 21 (19%) assessable patients had partial responses for a median of 4 months. Eight patients had stable disease for a median of 5+ (2 to 14+) months. Antineoplastic activity has been identified in children with high-grade astrocytomas and brainstem gliomas in a dose-intensive regimen. 
Cerebral vasoconstriction during head-upright tilt-induced vasovagal syncope. A paradoxic and unexpected response. BACKGROUND. To determine the effect of vasovagally mediated syncope on the cerebral circulation, transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess changes in cerebral blood flow velocity during head-upright tilt-induced syncope. METHODS AND RESULTS. Thirty patients (17 men and 13 women; mean age, 43 +/- 22 years) with recurrent unexplained syncope were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of intravenous isoproterenol (1-4 micrograms/min), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both. Transcranial Doppler sonography was used to assess middle cerebral artery systolic velocity (Vs), diastolic velocity (Vd), ratio of systolic to diastolic velocities, pulsatility index (PI = Vs-Vd/Vmean), and resistance index (RI = Vs-Vd/Vs) before, during, and after tilt. Syncope occurred in six patients (20%) during the baseline tilt and 14 (46%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 66%). In the tilt-positive patients, concomitant with the development of hypotension and bradycardia, transcranial Doppler sonography showed a 75 +/- 17% decrease in diastolic velocity, unchanged systolic velocity, a 46 +/- 17% decrease in mean velocity, a 295 +/- 227% increase in pulsatility index, and a 73 +/- 34% increase in resistance index. CONCLUSIONS. These findings reflect increased cerebrovascular resistance secondary to arteriolar vasoconstriction distal to the insonation point of the middle cerebral artery. This is paradoxic because the expected response of the cerebral circulation to hypotension is vasodilation. We conclude that abnormal baroreceptor responses triggered during vasovagal syncope result in a derangement of cerebral autoregulation with paradoxic vasoconstriction in the face of increasing hypotension. 
Intranodal leiomyoma. Another distinctive primary spindle cell neoplasm of lymph node. Two intranodal spindle cell neoplasms are described that were interpreted as leiomyomas. Both occurred in young men. The first case involved a single peripancreatic lymph node of a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who died of AIDS-related infection. The second case simulated a parotid gland tumor because of its location in an intraparotid lymph node in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Both neoplasms were composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with blunt-ended nuclei that seemed to arise from the walls of blood vessels. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for muscle-specific actin but were desmin negative. These leiomyomas expand the clinical and morphologic spectrum of primary spindle cell neoplasms of lymph nodes. 
Autosomal recessive lethal infantile cytochrome C oxidase deficiency. Three bedouin children with mitochondrial myopathy due to cytochrome c oxidase deficiency presented with progressive muscle weakness, failure to thrive, proximal renal tubular acidosis, and lactic acidemia leading to death. Two died by age 5 months and one by age 16 months. Cytochrome c oxidase was markedly reduced in skeletal muscle extracts of all three. Three other children of the same family with most probably the same metabolic aberration are also described. We suggest an autosomal recessive inheritance for this lethal mitochondrial myopathy. 
Adult paratesticular sarcomas: a review of 21 cases. We reviewed 21 patients more than 16 years old who were seen with a diagnosis of paratesticular sarcoma from 1958 to 1987. Of the patients 14 presented with primary disease and 7 with recurrent disease. The survival of the primarily treated patients was 58% at 5 years, calculated by the product limit method. Of the 14 patients with primary disease 13 had grade 3/4 or 4/4 sarcoma and 13 of 14 underwent initial radical orchiectomy. In addition, 6 of the 14 patients underwent an adjuvant operation or radiotherapy to the groin, or groin and scrotum, and none had local relapse. Some patients also had chemotherapy. Three patients underwent adjuvant retroperitoneal node dissection and 2 had microscopically positive nodes. All 3 patients remain without relapse. Six patients had relapse: 2 locally, 2 in the retroperitoneal nodes and 2 with distant metastases. Only 1 patient (with scrotal recurrence) was salvaged. Of the 7 patients referred with recurrent disease none was salvaged. In this series there is a 2 of 14 (14%) risk of local failure and a 4 of 14 (28%) risk of retroperitoneal relapse after radical orchiectomy. Since salvage has not proved successful, patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, intermediate or high grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma, or fibrosarcoma should be considered for adjuvant retroperitoneal node dissection. All patients should undergo adjuvant dissection or irradiation of the ipsilateral pelvic and groin nodes, and scrotum. 
The IVBF dual-blade plate and its applications. A recently developed simple device, the intervertebral body fixation dual-blade plate, was used in 88 cases of different spinal disorders. This patients in the first series were operated on from 1984 to 1986. The device is biomechanically simple and its application safe and easy. Using a proper bone grafting technique, it is a reliable device to establish spinal stability in spine surgery through an anterior approach. Its application in cases of fractures and fracture-dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine with paraplegia, tuberculous spondylitis, and primary tumors of vertebral bodies is presented. The midterm results, covering a follow-up period of 24-49 months (mean, 32 months) were satisfactory; there were no serious complications directly related to the device. There were four cases of pseudarthrosis due to insufficient bone graft technique. Of these, there were three cases of failure of the dual-blade plate. 
Atrioventricular septal defect repair in infants. From September 1984 through August 1989, 33 consecutive infants (mean age, 9 months; 13 male) received a single-stage intracardiac repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect. Preoperative evaluation of valvar morphology and function involved echocardiograms in 21% (7/33) and echocardiograms with cineangiograms in 79% (26/33). All infants operated on were included in the analysis. Patients with other complicating abnormalities were not excluded. All operations used a two-patch technique for closure of the atrioventricular septal defect in association with mitral valve repair. The newly formed septal leaflet of the mitral valve was repaired using unpledgeted interrupted sutures. Preoperative and postoperative echocardiograms were used to evaluate mitral valve regurgitation and left ventricular dysfunction as mild, moderate, or severe. The 30-day mortality was 6% (2/33). Follow-up ranged from 1 month to 60 months. Postoperative mitral valve insufficiency was mild in 84% versus 6% preoperatively, moderate in 3% versus 52% preoperatively, and severe in 13% versus 42% preoperatively. Mitral valve dysfunction necessitating reoperation occurred in 6% (2/31). Mitral valve function postoperatively was improved compared with preoperatively (p less than 0.001). The low 30-day operative mortality and the excellent late postoperative valvar function demonstrate the value of single-stage two-patch repair of atrioventricular septal defect early in life. 
Progressive deterioration of auditory evoked potentials after excision of an acoustic neurinoma: case report. The authors report the case of a 17-year-old girl who underwent excision of bilateral neurinomas of the cerebellopontine angle. Although her auditory evoked potentials were well maintained during the operation, they deteriorated gradually and progressively for the following 2 months. This seemed to reflect degeneration of the cochlear nerve fibers initiated by operative manipulation in the cerebellopontine angle in a patient who had no hearing when she awoke from surgery. 
Pure akinesia: an atypical manifestation of progressive supranuclear palsy. Two patients with "pure akinesia" who showed the characteristic changes of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) at necropsy are described. They had akinesia but no rigidity or tremor, and ophthalmoplegia was not observed during the course of illness. The symptoms of "pure akinesia" was not improved by levodopa therapy but was considerably improved by L-threo-3,4-dihydroxy-phenylserine. At necropsy, pathological findings were not different from those reported for PSP. It is suggested that "pure akinesia" is an atypical manifestation of PSP, and that norepinephrinergic neurons may be involved in some types of PSP. 
Treatable blindness in temporal arteritis. Temporal arteritis is a common cause of blindness. Prompt steroid treatment limits unilateral visual loss while protecting the contralateral eye. Established blindness is irreversible. We report a case of temporal arteritis in which an eye with no light perception secondary to an arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy regained 6/6 vision. 
Suprasellar and intraventricular blood predict elevated plasma atrial natriuretic factor in subarachnoid hemorrhage. Following subarachnoid hemorrhage, the plasma concentration of atrial natriuretic factor is elevated and appears to be independent of atrial stretch. While the hypothalamus and circumventricular organs contribute to sodium and intravascular volume regulation, their influence on atrial natriuretic factor is not known. We tested the hypothesis that, following subarachnoid hemorrhage, suprasellar cisternal blood, intraventricular blood, or ventricular enlargement would be associated with elevated plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor. Computed tomograms of 26 patients performed less than or equal to 3 days after hemorrhage were analyzed to determine the presence of suprasellar or intraventricular blood and enlargement of the third or lateral ventricle. These results were correlated with the plasma atrial natriuretic factor and serum sodium concentrations. The initial atrial natriuretic factor concentration was elevated and was higher in patients with suprasellar or intraventricular blood than in those without (suprasellar: 131 +/- 20 and 54 +/- 10 pg/ml, respectively; intraventricular: 137 +/- 25 and 84 +/- 31 pg/ml, respectively). The atrial natriuretic factor concentration remained higher over the week following hemorrhage in patients with suprasellar blood than in those without (127 +/- 16 and 68 +/- 12 pg/ml, respectively). The atrial natriuretic factor concentration was not correlated with hyponatremia (125-134 meq/l) or age-corrected ventricular size. Hyponatremia did not correlate with the presence of intraventricular or suprasellar blood. Our data suggest that suprasellar and intraventricular blood disturb hypothalamic function, resulting in an elevated plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentration. The presence of a direct relation between atrial natriuretic factor and hyponatremia remains unclear. 
Factors associated with atrial fibrillation in Q wave anterior myocardial infarction. To elucidate the role of inflammatory and hemodynamic factors in the genesis of atrial fibrillation in acute myocardial infarction, 228 patients with a first Q wave anterior myocardial infarction were studied. Forty-nine patients had pericarditis (detection of pericardial rub by careful auscultation), and 36 patients had echocardiographically demonstrated hydropericardium (presence of pericardial effusion without pericardial rub). During the first 3 days after admission, transient episodes of atrial fibrillation were observed in 10 patients (20%) with pericarditis (group 1), 15 patients (42%) with hydropericardium (group 2), and 20 patients (14%) without pericarditis and hydropericardium (group 3). Although there was no significant difference in the incidence of atrial fibrillation between groups 1 and 3, patients in group 2 had a significantly higher incidence of atrial fibrillation than those in groups 1 and 3. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and the number of advanced asynergic segments were found to be the important factors discriminating the three groups by multivariate analysis. Therefore atrial fibrillation after acute Q wave anterior infarction was not related to the inflammatory infiltration involving the atria but to the increase in atrial pressure resulting from hemodynamic change caused by more extensive myocardial damage. 
Case report: hepatic hydrothorax without ascites. Pleural effusion due to hepatic cirrhosis and ascites is well known. We describe three patients with right-sided hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites. The formation of pleural fluid in these patients is probably a result of fluid movement from peritoneal to pleural space across diaphragmatic defects before ascites can form. The differential diagnosis of a right-sided transudative pleural effusion in a patient with chronic liver disease with or without ascites includes congestive left ventricular failure and nephrotic syndrome. These diseases are usually ruled out with standard clinical tests. Patients with hepatic hydrothorax should be treated with fluid restriction and diuretics. Patients with severe symptoms due to refractory hepatic hydrothorax might benefit from pleural sclerosis and surgical closure of diaphragmatic defects. 
The subsequent risk of internal cancer with Bowen's disease. A population-based study OBJECTIVE--To address the subsequent risk of internal cancer in a population-based cohort of patients with Bowen's disease. DESIGN--Incident cases of skin cancers other than malignant melanoma occurring in a defined population were classified as basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, or Bowen's disease. Through medical records, all patients were followed up for the development of subsequent internal cancer until they died, moved from Rochester, Minn, or January 1, 1986, whichever came first. Incidence rates of skin cancer and subsequent cancer were computed; the subsequent rate of internal cancer was compared with that prevailing in the community. PATIENTS--Enrolled were all permanent residents in the population base of Rochester, Minn, who developed basal cell carcinoma (n = 657), squamous cell carcinoma (n = 169), or Bowen's disease (n = 71) on the basis of pathologic examination and clinical presentation from 1976 through 1984. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--The relative risk of subsequent internal cancer among patients with Bowen's disease compared with that of the population base from which they arose was 1.1 (95% confidence limits, 0.5, 1.6). RESULTS--Annual incidence rates, adjusted to the 1980 US white population, were 14.9 per 100,000 for Bowen's disease, 38.8 for squamous cell carcinoma, and 146 for basal cell carcinoma. The estimated relative risk for subsequent cancer was 0.9 (95% confidence limits, 0.5, 1.6) among patients with squamous cell carcinoma and 1.0 (95% confidence limits, 0.7, 1.3) for patients with basal cell carcinoma. These risks were not significantly different for various durations of follow-up or for sun-exposed vs sun-protected sites. CONCLUSIONS--We find no evidence in these population-based cohort data of and increased risk of subsequent internal cancer associated with Bowen's disease or other forms of nonmelanomatous skin cancer. 
Successful management of intractable cryptosporidial diarrhea with intravenous octreotide, a somatostatin analogue. A 38-year-old man with AIDS and intractable large-volume diarrhea due to a cryptosporidial infection was successfully treated with intravenous octreotide, a somatostatin analogue. The volume of diarrhea, 10-12 liters with 8-13 movements per day, was reduced to three to four semi-formed to formed stools per day when the patient was treated with 400 micrograms intravenous octreotide daily. The patient's intravenous hyperalimentation was discontinued and he returned to oral feeding. He quickly regained his normal weight and has now resumed his normal activities. For those patients who cannot tolerate subcutaneous administration, intravenous octreotide therapy may not only be life-saving but may also markedly increase the quality of life. Roxithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, was also administered to this patient with cryptosporidiosis but efficacy was not demonstrated. 
Leukemia and lymphoma immunophenotyping in cell smears with immunogold-silver staining. The potential of the immunogold-silver staining (IGSS) technique for immunophenotyping leukemia and lymphoma cells in cell smears was examined. Peripheral blood, bone marrow aspirates, lymph node biopsy specimens, fine-needle aspirates, and biologic fluids of 83 patients with acute or chronic leukemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, or Hodgkin's disease were labeled. Cell smears, cytocentrifuge preparations, or imprints were fixed, incubated with the reagents, and counterstained with May-Grunwald-Giemsa. Stable immunostaining and good morphologic characteristics allowed accurate cell identification and rapid enumeration of the positive cells. The immunophenotypes obtained with the use of 35 monoclonal antibodies with different specificities were similar to those determined by flow cytometry or immunohistochemical studies on the same samples. This IGSS method was especially useful for the examination of poor samples or complex cell suspensions with rare malignant cells. It could be an alternative to the immunoenzyme methods that generally are used for this purpose. 
A phase II study of mitoxantrone, etoposide, and thiotepa with autologous marrow support for patients with relapsed breast cancer. To further improve the effect of high-dose chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic breast cancer, we sought to develop a second active high-dose noncross-resistant regimen to use in tandem with our customary high-dose regimen of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and cisplatin (CVP). We performed a phase II trial of high-dose mitoxantrone 30 mg/m2, etoposide 200 mg/m2 every 12 hours x 6, and thiotepa 250 mg/m2 x 3 days (MVT) in 31 patients with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer and one with locally advanced chemotherapy-refractory breast cancer. These patients were ineligible for high-dose CVP chemotherapy because of the amount of prior treatment and poor-response status. Of the 32 patients, 14 responded to cycle 1, did not experience any grade 4 toxicity, and received a second cycle of MVT. Overall, seven of 31 patients achieved a complete response (CR; 23%). Four of the 14, who were partial responders to the first cycle, achieved a CR after the second cycle. The overall response rate was 19 of 31 (61%) with an overall median freedom from progression of 4 to 5 months and an overall median survival of 9 months. Toxicity consisted primarily of mucositis (grade 3 or 4 in 69%). The results indicate that high-dose MVT produces significant activity, even in heavily pretreated patients. Administration of a second cycle of high-dose therapy with MVT increased the CR rate, and the morbidity and mortality from the second cycle were not greater than that for the first cycle. Because of the high incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis with this regimen, we are currently completing a follow-up study of high-dose mitoxantrone and thiotepa alone. 
Radiographic evaluation of intraosseous implants of endodontic materials. Following several case reports of cyst development after endodontic treatment of decidous teeth, the osseous response to formaldehyde- or phenol-based materials was evaluated by a standardized radiographic technique. Endodontic medicaments contained in Teflon carriers were implanted between feline deciduous canine and molar teeth and the permanent successional teeth. Persistent radiolucency surrounding formocresol implants and sequestration of Kri-paste implants were noted in contrast to apparent bony healing around the zinc oxide-eugenol controls and those implants containing glutaraldehyde. These results suggest a greater tissue tolerance to glutaraldehyde-containing agents in contrast to the more traditional endodontic agents used in deciduous teeth. 
Oncogene expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cancer of cervix. Expression of the oncogenes Ha-RAS, c-MYC, and ERB-2 was investigated with an automated image analysis system in 12 specimens of normal cervix, 10 of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1, 24 of CIN 3, and 10 of invasive cancer of the cervix. There was amplification of all three oncogenes in CIN 3 and invasive cancer compared with normal cervix and CIN 1. The difference was most pronounced with an antibody to the RAS p21 protein, with no overlap between CIN 3 and the normal range. This method might be useful in screening for cervical neoplasia, and for the determination of which CIN lesions require treatment. 
Reactivity to vasoactive agents of canine basilar arteries exposed to experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Autologous blood was injected into the cisterna magna of mongrel dogs twice with an interval of 48 hours. They were killed 3 days, 1 week, or 4 weeks after the first injection of blood, and helical strips of the basilar artery were prepared. Contractions induced by 5-hydroxytryptamine, noradrenaline, prostaglandin F2 alpha, and oxyhemoglobin were significantly potentiated. Relaxations caused by nicotine, K+, arachidonic acid, and prostaglandin I2 were suppressed, but the relaxant response to calcium ionophore A23187 and substance P did not change significantly. These results suggest that contractions mediated via activation of alpha, 5-hydroxytryptamine, and prostaglandin F2 alpha receptors are potentiated, and relaxations caused by stimulation of vasodilator nerves and by endogenous and exogenous prostaglandin I2 are attenuated in dog basilar arteries exposed to subarachnoid clot. On the other hand, certain relaxations possibly mediated by endothelium-derived relaxing factor do not appear to be significantly influenced. 
Invasive treatment for coronary artery disease in the elderly. The widespread availability of coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty presents important treatment options for the older patient. The findings from a number of surgical series of coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty are summarized. Certain trends are evident. Perioperative mortality, cardiovascular morbidity, and other complications, while declining, remain somewhat higher in elderly patients. However, the impact of age alone is slight. In both coronary artery bypass grafting and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, complications are more closely correlated with the presence of serious concomitant disease. Long-term survival and pain relief after coronary artery bypass grafting are excellent in older patients, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty may be the treatment of choice in some elderly patients with coronary artery disease. As in younger patients, prolongation of survival should not be the exclusive goal. Rather, a focus on quality of life and freedom from dependency should be seriously considered. 
Reduced cerebral grey matter observed in alcoholics using magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-eight chronic alcoholics and 36 age- and sex-matched non-alcoholic controls were examined with magnetic resonance imaging and brain morphometric analyses. Results confirmed large increases in subarachnoid cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume and mild ventricular enlargement in the alcoholics and revealed associated volume reductions of localized cortical and subcortical cerebral structures. Volume losses in the diencephalon, the caudate nucleus, dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortex, and mesial temporal lobe structures were the most prominent. Significant correlations between increments in cortical and ventricular CSF and decrements in the volume of cortical and subcortical grey matter were noted. Although there was little evidence for relationships between performance on neuropsychological tests and volume of grey matter structures, significant correlations between some cognitive measures and subcortical and cortical fluid volumes were found. The parallels between this pattern of affected structures and recent neuropathological findings are discussed. 
Influence of anesthesiology residents' noncognitive skills on the occurrence of critical incidents and the residents' overall clinical performances. The authors examined residents' clinical performances in five anesthesiology departments in U.S. teaching hospitals. The data were organized by daily use of the Clinical Anesthesia System of Evaluation, which categorizes and quantifies the narrative comments of faculty. The study was designed to identify predictor categories (particular performance characteristics of residents) for the residents' overall performances and their scores in handling critical incidents (those incidents that could or would have caused significant morbidity or mortality had faculty not intervened). More than 9,000 comments made by 163 faculty about 45 residents were analyzed. Residents' noncognitive skills that were predictors of overall performance were Conscientiousness, Management, Confidence, Critical Incidents, and Knowledge. Conscientiousness and Composure predicted two-thirds of the variability in critical incidents' scores. Path analysis verified causal relationships between the hypothesized predictors and critical incidents. For the residents studied, inadequate noncognitive performance in some areas was a powerful (p less than .0005) predictor of overall clinical performance and was related to the occurrence of critical incidents. 
Childhood blindness in the Republic of Ireland: a national survey. We completed a national study of blindness in children under 16. Approximately 80% of the blind children (that is, with vision of 3/60 or less) in the Republic of Ireland (172 children) were seen, 93 males and 79 females. The survey was carried out between July 1989 and June 1990. It is the first such study to be carried out. Ninety seven (56%) children had lesions due to factors acting before the perinatal period. Of these, 28 (16% of the total number surveyed) had lesions due to genetic causes; 69 (40%) had lesions due to factors operating in the prenatal period other than genetic factors. Forty six (27%) had lesions due to factors acting in the perinatal period. Twenty two (13%) had lesions due to factors acting in childhood. (4% could not be categorised in this way). The commonest single primary diagnoses were birth asphyxia in 19 (11%) cases and retinopathy of prematurity in 19 (11%) cases. 
Binding of anti-acetaldehyde IgG antibodies to hepatocytes with an acetaldehyde-phosphatidylethanolamine adduct on their surface. We have previously shown that antibodies raised against acetaldehyde adducts of protein cross-react with an acetaldehyde adduct of dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, N-ethyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, when the latter is incorporated into hexagonal phase phospholipid micelles. In the present study we demonstrate that these same IgG antibodies cross-react with N-ethyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine when this adduct is incorporated into the surface of hepatocytes. Hapten-specific IgG antibodies were purified from the sera of rabbits sensitized to an albumin-acetaldehyde conjugate that had been reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride (N-ethyl-RSA). The N-ethyl-RSA was coupled to an Affi-Gel-10 column to affinity purify the IgG. Liposomes containing N-ethyl-dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine were fused with isolated hepatocytes, the affinity purified primary IgG antibodies were added, then fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies were added, and antibody binding to hepatocytes was measured by flow cytometry. The fluorescence of these hepatocytes was significantly greater (p less than 0.01) than control hepatocytes prepared with (1) pre-immune primary IgG antibodies with fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies, (2) no primary antibody but with fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies, and (3) no fluorescein-conjugated second antibodies. 
Postoperative hyperbilirubinemia after resection of thoracic esophageal cancer. The rate of occurrence of postoperative hyperbilirubinemia (PHB) following esophagectomy for thoracic esophageal cancer was 67%, 115/171 cases, which was significantly higher than those following total gastrectomy (28%, 40/144 cases) and colectomy (12%, 7/59 cases). Among the operative procedures, right thoracotomy with extensive lymphoadenectomy had the highest rate of PHB (87%), perhaps due to the longest operation time and the largest intraoperative blood loss. Preoperative risk factors were glucose intolerance, reduced lymphocyte count, and poor nutritional state. The change in bile acid composition, as well as the elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, indicated the presence of postoperative cholestasis which was relevant to total parenteral nutrition. The results suggest that the development of PHB was related to the extent of surgery and the use of parenteral nutrition. 
Intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis: case report. The authors present a case of intrathoracic meningocele associated with neurofibromatosis. Computed tomography with metrizamide myelography proved valuable in locating the lesion, thus facilitating surgical intervention. With the preoperative diagnosis established and the severity of the meningocele known, the surgeons safely employed a subpleural approach at thoracotomy. 
Stapes surgery: complications and airway infection. From a group of 1,111 patients who had stapedectomy or stapedotomy performed in a 10-year period, a thorough investigation was made of 11 patients who had a total hearing loss and 8 patients who developed a partial sensorineural hearing loss after operation. The data obtained indicate that postoperative infection with influenza virus may be responsible for unexpected complications following stapedectomy. A close relation was found between the appearance of complications and periods of epidemics of influenza. 
Carotenoids and liposoluble vitamins in liver cirrhosis. The role played by carotenoids, retinol and tocopherol in quencing oxidative cellular damage and combatting tumor growth is well documented, but little is known about their activity in human liver cirrhosis (LC), where oxidative damage and tumoral complications are common-place. We investigated 59 patients with LC of different etiology on admission to hospital and compared them with 32 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. Nutritional (cutaneous skinfolds, creatinine-height index) and serum parameters were determined; of these, alpha- and beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lycopene, retinol and alpha-tocopherol were detected by an high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) technique, devised in our laboratory, which afforded an accurate and simultaneous resolution of all six compounds. The results point to a significant reduction in almost all the vitamin factors in LC, as well as in total serum lipids. In consequence, the ratio tocopherol/total serum lipids remains almost unchanged: 2.45 +/- 0.08 (m +/- se) in controls and 2.34 +/- 0.16 in patients. The effects of age, sex, nutritional habits, alcohol, malnutrition and the severity of the disease were also evaluated in relation to the vitamin-factor levels. It is suggested that the reduced levels observed in LC patients are due to a number of factors including portal hypertension and lymphatic circulation impairment, and it is concluded that thorough screening and improved diet are beneficial in the follow-up of LC. 
Intracellular compartmentation of cardiac troponin T and its release kinetics in patients with reperfused and nonreperfused myocardial infarction. In a previous study on the diagnostic efficiency of troponin T measurements in patients with suspected acute myocardial infarction (AMI), the authors found a high variability of troponin T serum concentration changes on day 1 in patients with AMI who underwent thrombolytic treatment. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to investigate the intracellular compartmentation of troponin T and to analyze the effects of AMI reperfusion on the appearance kinetics of cardiac troponin T in serum. Cardiac troponin T was measured with a newly developed bideterminant sandwich assay using cardiospecific, affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies and peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody. An unbound cytosolic troponin T pool was found in ultracentrifuged homogenates of myocardial tissue of different species ranging from 0.013 to 0.036 mg/g wet weight. The soluble troponin T molecule had electrophoretic properties identical to troponin T compartmented in the myofibrils. The clinical study group comprised 57 patients with AMI undergoing thrombolytic treatment. Blood flow to the infarct zone and point of time of reperfusion were tested by immediate and late angiography. The appearance of troponin T in serum on day 1 after the onset of AMI depended strongly on reperfusion and on duration of ischemia before reperfusion. Thus, in patients with early reperfused AMI, a marked peak in troponin T serum concentrations was found at 14 hours after the onset of pain. This early troponin T peak was absent in patients with AMI reperfusion occurring greater than 5.5 hours after the onset of pain and in patients with nonreperfused AMI. By contrast, the kinetics of troponin T release after the first day after AMI were unaffected by reperfusion. 
Adenomatoid hyperplasia of minor salivary glands. Adenomatoid hyperplasia of minor salivary glands is an uncommon clinicopathologic entity. It comprises clinical swelling resembling a neoplasm with a histologic picture of aggregates of normal-appearing salivary gland tissue in excess of that anticipated for the anatomic site. The significance of this lesion is derived from its clinical resemblance to a neoplasm of salivary gland origin. This study adds 40 new cases to the literature and analyzes their clinical and histologic features. Most of the lesions were located on the hard and soft palates. The exact nature of the minor salivary gland hyperplasia is not clear. Some of the cases may represent a hamartoma or a reactive hyperplasia, but in most cases the nature of the hyperplasia is idiopathic. 
Sonography of focal lesions of the spleen. The sonographic appearances of benign and malignant splenic lesions in 154 patients are illustrated. Sixty-six of the 154 patients had malignant splenic lesions; 55 of these had malignant lymphoma and 11 had splenic metastatic lesions. The lesions were hypoechoic in 64 cases (97%), including all cases of malignant lymphoma, and were hyperechoic in two. Eighty-eight patients had benign splenic lesions; findings included cysts, infarcts, abscesses, hemangiomas, and calcifications. 
"Ex vivo" release of eicosanoid from human brain tissue: its relevance in the development of brain edema. The specific mechanism underlying the genesis of vasogenic brain edema is still debated: the role of arachidonic acid is considered extremely important, as it is a possible activator of self-maintaining reactions enhancing the release of vasoactive and cytotoxic compounds. The relationship between arachidonic acid metabolism and brain edema has been studied primarily in brain tissue samples or in the extracellular fluid, whereas the residual capacity of perilesional tissue to synthesize and release eicosanoids has not been investigated. In the present study, perilesional samples of brain tissue were available from 4 patients operated on for brain metastasis, from 8 patients who had malignant neuroepithelial tumors, from 4 with meningiomas, and from 5 with subarachnoid hemorrhage. A brain edema index was calculated from the preoperative computed tomographic scan. The "ex vivo" method allowed determination of the residual capacity of endogenous arachidonic acid metabolism. The edema index is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis (6.5 +/- 0.8) and neuroepithelial tumors (3.6 +/- 0.2) than in those with meningiomas (1.5 +/- 0.06), subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.7 +/- 0.18), and in controls. In patients with metastatic and neuroepithelial tumors there is a significant correlation between peritumoral brain edema and the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 (P less than 0.05); the capacity to synthesize leukotriene C4 is also significantly elevated after subarachnoid hemorrhage (13.91 +/- 2.6 ng/ml of incubation medium) when compared with control cases (5.56 +/- 0.91). The capacity to synthesize prostacyclin is significantly higher in patients with brain metastasis than in those with neuroepithelial tumors and meningiomas (P less than 0.05). 
Loss of heterozygosity suggests multiple genetic alterations in pheochromocytomas and medullary thyroid carcinomas. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at specific loci may help localize tumor suppressor genes involved in the formation of various familial and sporadic tumors. In addition, the genetic loci for a number of familial tumor syndromes have been mapped by linkage analysis. To explore the possible role of tumor suppressor genes in endocrine tumors, we tested 41 pheochromocytomas (34 sporadic and 7 familial) and 11 medullary thyroid cancers (MTC) (10 sporadic and 1 familial) for LOH near a variety of potentially important genetic loci: (a) the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A) locus on chromosome 10; (b) the von Hippel-Lindau locus on 3p; and (c) the p53 and neurofibromatosis 1 loci on 17. We also examined chromosomes 1p and 22q because previous studies in a small number of pheochromocytomas and MTCs suggested LOH in these regions. Background rates for LOH were assessed using several "random" probes. Finally, we examined a number of clinical and histologic characteristics of these tumors for possible correlations with specific genetic alterations. LOH in the region of the MEN 2A locus was uncommon (0% for MTCs, 5% for pheochromocytomas). However, we found significant allelic losses in pheochromocytomas on chromosomes 1p (42%), 3p (16%), 17p (24%), and 22q (31%). We also noted a correlation between LOH on 1p and urinary excretion of metanephrine by these patients (P = 0.02). LOH on 1p, 3p, and 17p also appeared to be associated with increased tumor volume. Analysis of the smaller number of MTCs demonstrated allelic losses on chromosomes 1p and 22q. Our results suggest that tumor formation and/or progression in pheochromocytomas and MTCs involves multiple genes, analogous with the model proposed for colon carcinoma. 
Differences in the leucine aminopeptidase activity in extracts from human prostatic carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Extracts of tissue showed that prostatic carcinomas contain less leucine aminopeptidase activity than benign prostatic hyperplasia. This is true when activity is expressed as specific activity (P = 0.0033), specific activity/% epithelium (P = 0.0007), activity/wet weight of tissue (P = 0.0028), or activity/wet weight of tissue/% epithelium (P = 0.0005). Almost all histochemically demonstrable activity is located in the epithelium. Enzymatic activities in extracts and in histochemical preparations showed similar differences between carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia and were related (R = -0.38, P = 0.0400) to Gleason's grades. The transurethrally resected prostate cancers studied contained no well-differentiated tumors and a high proportion of poorly differentiated tumors. Histochemical activity is absent in most prostatic carcinomas and decreased in others. This observation is particularly interesting in view of the growing knowledge of tumor suppressor genes. 
Dopaminergic induced changes in cognitive and motor processing in Parkinson's disease: an electrophysiological investigation. Event-related potentials and reaction time measures to auditory discrimination tasks of graded difficulty were used to separate cognitive from motor processing time in 27 patients with newly diagnosed, previously untreated Parkinson's disease and later on optimal levodopa treatment. Before treatment event-related potential P3 and task performance were normal but the reaction time was prolonged compared with age matched controls. After treatment P3 latency was significantly prolonged and the reaction time reduced suggesting a dopamine induced dissociation between cognitive and motor processing. In early Parkinson's disease cognitive processing time remains normal but the motor processing time is prolonged. Dopamine replacement is followed by significantly reduced motor processing time despite increased cognitive processing time. Motor processing may reflect the dopamine status of the putamen whereas dopaminergic over-stimulation of other regions may adversely affect cognitive processing in patients treated with levodopa. 
Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients. A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data. At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy. No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen. However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses. In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment. Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events. 
Treatment of herpes zoster and postherpetic neuralgia. Herpes zoster results from reactivation of latent varicella-zoster virus. It is most common in elderly patients and immunosuppressed patients, especially those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Zoster is often the earliest indicator of HIV infection. The acute course of herpes zoster is generally benign, but systemic complications may be fatal. Postherpetic neuralgia is the major chronic complication and is a difficult management problem. High-dose acyclovir (800 mg orally five times daily) has recently been approved for treatment of herpes zoster and, if started early, decreases the duration and severity of symptoms. In the prevention of postherpetic neuralgia, acyclovir does not appear to be effective, and the efficacy of steroids is questionable. The best therapy currently available for postherpetic neuralgia is amitriptyline, topical capsaicin and transcutaneous electrical stimulation. 
Effect of octreotide (SMS 201-995) on meal-stimulated pancreatic secretion in three patients with external pancreatic fistula. Octreotide (SMS 201-995) is a long-acting somatostatin analogue that inhibits both basal and secretin-cholecystokinin-stimulated pancreatic secretion. This study assesses the effect of this compound on pancreatic secretion induced by ordinary meals. Three patients with stable secretion of pure pancreatic juice from high output pancreatic fistula were studied. In all three, meal ingestion caused a marked and prolonged increase in pancreatic juice flow, and in bicarbonate and protein output. The subcutaneous injection of 50 micrograms octreotide before meals almost totally prevented (by about 90%) this increase. The inhibitory effect of octreotide on postprandial pancreatic secretion appeared soon, and persisted for the duration of the study period (8 h). 
Treatment with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha protects rats against the lethality, hypotension, and hypothermia of gram-negative sepsis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a peptide secreted by macrophages in response to endotoxin that can produce many of the changes seen in septic shock. After cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) rats gradually develop tachycardia, hypotension, tachypnea, and hypothermia. At 5 h post-CLP, rats have a peak in serum levels of endotoxin and 60% of rats have blood cultures that grow Gram-negative rods (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia). At 20 h post-CLP all rats develop positive blood cultures. Serum levels of TNF are not reproducibly measurable in rats following CLP. Rats undergoing CLP have a 50-80% mortality with deaths usually occurring 24-72 h postinjury. Repetitive (twice daily x 6 d) i.p. injection of sublethal doses of recombinant human TNF-alpha (100 micrograms/kg) to rats undergoing CLP 1 d after the treatment period resulted in a significant reduction in mortality compared to control rats previously unexposed to rTNF (P less than 0.03). Animals treated with rTNF had no hypotension or hypothermia after CLP and regained normal food intake faster than control rats. 12 h after CLP the gene expression for manganous superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), an inducible mitochondrial metalloenzyme responsible for cellular resistance to injury from toxic reactive oxygen species, was higher in livers of rats treated with rTNF suggesting that the TNF treatment augmented expression of this protective enzyme. Unlike MnSOD, expression of the gene for copper-zinc SOD was not affected by CLP or rTNF treatment. The results suggest that prior treatment with recombinant TNF can ameliorate the lethality, hypotension, hypothermia, and anorexia of Gram-negative sepsis in rats and that the mechanism may be related to enhanced hepatic expression of the gene for MnSOD. Repeated administration of recombinant TNF may be a strategy to minimize mortality and morbidity of Gram-negative sepsis. 
Reflux esophagitis therapy: sucralfate versus ranitidine in a double blind multicenter trial. Sucralfate (Sc) suspension 6 g/day and ranitidine (Rn) tablets, 150 mg, were compared in 125 patients in a double-blind, multicenter, endoscopically controlled trial in the treatment of reflux esophagitis. Inclusion criteria were symptomatic reflux (number and severity of attacks) and endoscopic evidence of esophagitis (grades 1 to 4). Clinical assessments were performed on entry, and at 4 and at 8 weeks, and endoscopy was repeated at 8 weeks. Sc suspension and Rn placebo or Sc placebo and Rn tablets were taken on waking and immediately before retiring at night. Of the 125 patients, 27 were withdrawn because of default (Rn = 4; Sc = 14), noncompliance (Rn = 1; Sc = 2), or the development of congestive cardiac failure (Rn = 1), diarrhea (Rn = 1; Sc = 1), nausea (Sc = 1), constipation (Sc = 1), and hematemesis (Sc = 1). Analysis was performed on the remaining 98 patients, 43 of whom had been treated with Sc and 55 with Rn. Heartburn, acid regurgitation, epigastric pain, dysphagia, and chest pain were relieved in 34% vs 40%, 67% vs 72%, 71% vs 57%, and 86% vs 63% for Sc and Rn, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups. Endoscopic healing occurred in 47% of the Sc- and in 31% of the Rn-treated patients (chi 2 = 2.50), and healing or improvement was noted in 81% of the Sc- and 64% of the Rn-treated patients. This difference approached statistical significance (chi 2 = 3.73). There was no obvious endoscopic benefit in 8 of the 43 and 20 of the 55 patients in the groups treated with Sc and Rn, respectively. Although the findings with sucralfate and ranitidine in patients with reflux esophagitis completing the trial suggest a benefit of these agents, the absence of a placebo control group and the high default rates, particularly for those receiving sucralfate, preclude any firm conclusions as to relative or specific efficacy of these agents in this condition. 
Vestibular autorotation test asymmetry analysis of acoustic neuromas. The vestibular autorotation test (VAT) measures the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) response from 2 to 6 Hz, during 18 seconds of active head movements, while the patient attempts to fixate on a wall-mounted target. A new method of measuring eye velocity asymmetry from VAT data is presented, based on computer estimation of the 0th harmonics of discrete Fourier spectra over short segments of digital eye and head velocity records. Eye asymmetries greater than a 3% normal range are shown to be directionally correlated with the side of the lesions in patients with unilateral labyrinthectomies. Among patients with a diagnosis of acoustic neuroma, who were tested preoperatively with the VAT, nine of nine patients showed eye asymmetries greater than 3% toward the side of the neuroma. Those patients with acoustic neuromas who have sufficiently vigorous high-frequency head responses showed mean percentages of eye asymmetry that were linearly correlated with the size of the acoustic neuroma. These results suggest that VAT high-frequency asymmetry provides a useful method of diagnostic evaluation of the side and extent of unilateral peripheral lesions. 
Antiischemic and metabolic effects of glutamate during pacing in patients with stable angina pectoris secondary to either coronary artery disease or syndrome X. The effects of glutamate on anginal threshold, cardiac metabolism and hemodynamics were studied in 11 patients with stable angina pectoris, positive stress test results, and pacing-induced myocardial lactate release due to coronary artery disease (CAD) (n = 9) or syndrome X (n = 2). Data were obtained before, during and after 2 identical periods of coronary sinus pacing, the second being preceded by an intravenous injection of monosodium glutamate 1.2 (n = 7) or 2.5 (n = 4) mg/kg body weight. After glutamate administration, pacing time to onset of angina increased from mean +/- standard deviation 103 +/- 53 to 166 +/- 71 seconds (p less than 0.01) and ST-segment depression after pacing decreased from 2.3 +/- 1.0 to 1.6 +/- 1.1 mm (p less than 0.01). Arterial glutamate concentration increased 60% (p less than 0.01) after the low dose and 150% (p less than 0.01) after the high dose of glutamate. Regardless of dose, myocardial glutamate uptake increased by 25% (p less than 0.01). Pacing-induced cardiac release of lactate diminished 50% (p less than 0.05), whereas the releases of xanthine and hypoxanthine were unchanged by glutamate. Arterial free fatty acids decreased 20% (p less than 0.01). Circulating levels and cardiac exchanges of alanine, glucose and citrate were unchanged. Glutamate did not influence heart rate, arterial blood pressure, coronary blood flow, coronary vascular resistance or myocardial oxygen consumption. One patient complained of short-lasting burning sensations after receiving the high glutamate dose. In conclusion, augmented provision of glutamate enhances pacing tolerance in stable angina, presumably by a metabolic improvement of cardiac energy production during ischemia. 
The effect of 'detailing' on physicians' prescribing behavior for postsurgical narcotic analgesia. Physicians have been frequently reported to prescribe inadequately pain medication in the hospitalized patient. A number of methods and techniques have been attempted to alter this phenomenon including audit, standard setting, drug utilization evaluation and sanctioning. The purpose of the following study was to demonstrate the behavioral efficacy of the technique of detailing. We reviewed the postsurgical records of 320 patients for pre-established criteria on the administration of meperidine before and after detailing of the proper prescribing with regard to timing and dose. The data show 30% of the sample meeting the criteria before detailing and 43% after detailing had been given. We conclude the method of detailing can be effective in altering physician's prescribing behavior for meperidine in postoperative surgical patients. 
A new approach to the assessment of tomographic thallium-201 scintigraphy in patients with left bundle branch block. To determine whether a new approach to interpretation could improve the accuracy of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of left anterior descending coronary artery disease in patients with left bundle branch block, 69 patients were evaluated. Forty-four had angiographically proved coronary artery disease; the remaining 25 were considered to have a "low" (mean 13.5 +/- 6.4%, range 3.4% to 24.9%) likelihood of disease before thallium-201 scintigraphy. The conventional scintigraphic criterion for detection of left anterior descending artery disease (septal, anterior or apical defects) was compared with a new criterion that required the apex to be abnormal to indicate left anterior descending disease. The normalcy rates in the low likelihood patient group were significantly improved by using the new approach, from 16% to 80% (p less than 0.0001) by visual analysis and from 24% to 64% (p = 0.003) by quantitative SPECT polar map analysis. The sensitivity for left anterior descending disease was similar for the conventional and the new method by visual (100% vs. 94%) and quantitative (100% vs. 83%) analyses. In contrast, the specificity was significantly improved by using the new approach, from 14% to 79% (p = 0.0006) by visual analysis and 14% to 64% (p = 0.007) by quantitative analysis. In conclusion, septal and anterior thallium-201 SPECT defects are common in patients with left bundle branch block without coronary artery disease, resulting in low specificity for left anterior descending artery disease. The normalcy rates and accuracy for detection of left anterior descending coronary artery disease were significantly better when an apical defect was used as the criterion for disease. 
Fatty infiltration of the liver: quantification with phase-contrast MR imaging at 1.5 T vs biopsy. Quantification of hepatic fat content by application of MR phase-contrast imaging (Dixon method) at 1.5 T was compared with results of biopsy in 16 patients with a variety of liver abnormalities. Motion artifact was suppressed by employing six or eight averages of short TR in-phase (echo offset, 0 msec), out-of-phase (echo offset, 1.1 msec), and in-phase (echo offset, 2.2 msec) spin-echo pulse sequences. The 360 degree out-of-phase sequence was used to assess the impact of T2* decay on this method of estimating fat fraction. A standard two-echo long TR sequence also was obtained in all patients. Histologic preparations from the biopsy specimens were examined by a pathologist who had no knowledge of the MR results and were graded according to overall visual assessment as belonging to one of four categories of fat fraction. Results of the MR-calculated apparent fat fraction were compared directly with biopsy category and were also placed in MR fat fraction categories, allowing estimation of the statistical correlation between the biopsy and MR grading systems. Eight of eight patients with biopsy categories indicating a fat fraction of less than 0.25 were computed by MR to have a fat fraction of less than 0.1. Seven of eight patients with biopsy categories indicating a fat fraction of greater than 0.25 were computed by MR to have a fat fraction of at least 0.24. The MR-calculated apparent fat fraction category correlated significantly with the histologic biopsy category (r = .86, p less than .01). When compared with the in-phase image, decreased signal from liver was visually apparent on the 180 degree out-of-phase images in all cases in which the fat fraction was at least 0.24, but there was no indication of fatty liver on the standard T1- or T2-weighted images. Calculated T2 also showed no correlation with degree of fatty deposition. Correction for T2* decay by using the 360 degree out-of-phase acquisition in addition to the standard 0 degree and 180 degree out-of-phase images had little effect on fat fraction computation. Phase-contrast MR is a promising noninvasive method for quantitative assessment of fatty deposition in the liver. 
Brain in eclampsia: MR imaging with clinical correlation. Cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed on eight consecutive patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures caused by eclampsia. Each patient underwent serial neurologic examinations until all symptoms resolved. Six of those eight patients underwent follow-up MR imaging. These patients were compared with those in previous case reports of MR imaging abnormalities of the brain in eclampsia. MR imaging typically demonstrates bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images and iso- to hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images. MR imaging abnormalities are most commonly located in the distribution of the posterior cerebral circulation and are associated with visual disturbances. Basal ganglia and deep white matter lesions are less common and are associated with mental status changes. Most lesions seen at MR imaging in patients with eclampsia are reversible. 
Comparative rates of desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors by the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. Three separate processes may contribute to rapid beta-adrenergic receptor desensitization: functional uncoupling from the stimulatory guanine nucleotide-binding protein Gs, mediated by phosphorylation of the receptors by two distinct kinases, the specific beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (beta ARK) and the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), as well as a spatial uncoupling via sequestration of the receptors away from the cell surface. To evaluate the relative importance and potential role of the various processes in different physiological situations, a kinetic analysis of these three mechanisms was performed in permeabilized A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells. To allow a separate analysis of each mechanism, inhibitors of the various desensitization mechanisms were used: heparin to inhibit beta ARK, the PKA inhibitor peptide PKI to inhibit PKA, and concanavalin A treatment to prevent sequestration. Isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of beta 2 receptors in these cells by beta ARK occurred with a t1/2 of less than 20 sec, whereas phosphorylation by PKA had a t1/2 of about 2 min. Similarly, beta ARK-mediated desensitization of the receptors proceeded with a t1/2 of less than 15 sec, and PKA-mediated desensitization with a t1/2 of about 3.5 min. Maximal desensitization mediated by the two kinases corresponded to a reduction of the signal-transduction capacity of the receptor/adenylyl cyclase system by about 60% in the case of beta ARK and by about 40% in the case of PKA. Receptor sequestration was much slower (t1/2 of about 10 min) and involved no more than 30% of the cell surface receptors. It is concluded that beta ARK-mediated phosphorylation is the most rapid and quantitatively most important factor contributing to the rapid desensitization. This rapidity of the beta ARK-mediated mechanism makes it particularly well suited to regulate beta-adrenergic receptor function in rapidly changing environments such as the synaptic cleft. 
Use of parenteral medium-chain triglyceride emulsion for maintaining seizure control in a 5-year-old girl with intractable diarrhea. Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) are an important component of an enteral ketogenic diet for seizure control. Previously, it was difficult to maintain ketosis when parenteral (iv) nutrition therapy was necessary. The use of iv MCT in a 5-year-old girl with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome who had diarrhea and dehydration is reported. Conventional 20% iv fat emulsion (long-chain triglycerides, LCT) and dextrose free hyperalimentation (HAL) in a 4:1 ketogenic ratio did not maintain adequate ketosis during bowel rest. Compassionate use of iv MCT (Clintec Nutrition) infused as a 70:30 MCT/LCT ratio plus HAL maintained moderate ketosis. Seizures were well controlled during the iv MCT regimen, which allowed normal daily functioning. Complications included abnormal liver function tests and severe iron deficiency anemia of unknown etiology. Serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels increased to 1717 mg/dl and 614 mg/dl, respectively, but decreased with a reduction of lipid infusion and use of an antihyperlipemic drug. Nutritional status was maintained. In this case, iv MCT proved to be a relatively safe and effective short-term method of continuing parenteral nutrition while maintaining ketosis for seizure control. 
Management of traumatic injuries to the facial nerve. Penetrating and nonpenetrating trauma to the head and neck produces myriad injuries to the facial nerve. This article presents a rationale of management of neural injury, emphasizing extracranial and intratemporal trauma and techniques of neurorrhaphy. 
Defenses against oxidation in human erythrocytes: role of glutathione reductase in the activation of glucose decarboxylation by hemolytic drugs. We have used 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, a selective inhibitor of oxidized glutathione reductase (GSSG-R), to examine the role of this enzyme in regulating the hexose monophosphate shunt (HMS) and to explore how a variety of agents influence glucose decarboxylation in intact human red blood cells (RBCs). Substances tested included primaquine and several other drugs that are specially hemolytic and methemoglobinemic in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and related disorders. The results allowed us to distinguish and quantitate contrasting modes of HMS stimulation and to clarify how RBCs respond to different classes of oxidants. Some agents like methylene blue (MB), phenazine methosulfate, and pyrroline carboxylate do not require GSSG-R to increase CO2 production; they activate G6PD and 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase by directly oxidizing reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). Other compounds, like ascorbate, nitrofurantoin, and doxorubicin, oxidize GSH primarily; CO2 increases indirectly only when GSSG-R, activated by glutathione disulfide (GSSG), raises the level of NADP. Chemicals like primaquine, daunorubicin, and methylphenylazoformate trigger the HMS by independently oxidizing both NADPH and GSH. Unlike MB, most drugs that are hemolytic in G6PD deficiency activate the HMS in a manner that depends to a variable extent on GSSG-R. This variability may explain hitherto puzzling clinical and pharmacogenetic differences between primaquine and diaminodiphenylsulfone-induced hemolysis. 
Effect of transient coronary occlusion on coronary blood flow autoregulation, vasodilator reserve and response to adenosine in the dog. Myocardial ischemia of short duration (15 to 20 min) produces myocardial "stunning" during reperfusion. The vasoregulatory and contractile status of reperfused myocardium during normal and reduced perfusion pressures is of interest in the treatment of patients with unstable angina. In the present study the effects of 15 min of reversible ischemic injury on several aspects of coronary vasoregulation were assessed with use of pressure-flow curves in anesthetized open chest dogs. The left anterior descending coronary artery was cannulated and perfused with arterial blood with use of a servo-controlled roller pump. The autoregulatory gain and an adenosine dose-response curve for coronary flow before and after ischemia and reperfusion were obtained. The maximal autoregulatory gain values in the pressure range of 140 to 60 mm Hg were not significantly different before and after ischemia and reperfusion (0.41 +/- 0.08 vs. 0.5 +/- 0.06, p greater than 0.1). The adenosine dose-response curve was significantly shifted to the right after reperfusion; however, coronary blood flows during maximal adenosine vasodilation over a large range of perfusion pressures (140 to 60 mm Hg) were significantly greater after ischemia and reperfusion. The pressure-dependent decrease in segment shortening (sonomicrometry) over the coronary pressure range of 160 to 30 mm Hg was similar in myocardium before and after stunning. Contractile function in the stunned myocardium at normal (100 mm Hg) and low (40 mm Hg) coronary perfusion pressures was similarly and significantly enhanced by the administration of adenosine. It is concluded that 1) coronary autoregulation is unchanged after brief ischemia and reperfusion; 2) although maximal coronary vascular conductance assessed with adenosine is greater after ischemia, the coronary circulation shows a decreased coronary sensitivity to exogenous adenosine; 3) the relation of contractile function to coronary pressure before and after stunning is unchanged; and 4) enhancement of function in stunned myocardium by vasodilation with adenosine occurs at low and normal perfusion pressures. 
Ultrasonographic diagnosis of symptomatic deep venous thrombosis in pregnancy. Color flow imaging combined with compression ultrasonography were used to prospectively evaluate symptomatic patients first seen with suspected deep vein thrombosis during pregnancy. The incidence of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis (7 of 10,000 deliveries) shown prospectively by ultrasonography was similar to that of historic controls who had a diagnosis confirmed by venography (11 of 26,191 deliveries). A preferential pattern of proximal left-sided iliac or femoral vein involvement was common to both cohorts, being seen in five of the seven cases diagnosed by ultrasonography and eight of the eleven cases diagnosed by venography. We conclude that ultrasonography, consisting of compression ultrasonography and color flow imaging, can replace venography in the diagnosis and evaluation of the extent of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis during pregnancy. 
Antenatal diagnosis of fetal splenic cyst. A case report. Antenatal ultrasonography detected a fetal splenic cyst at 35 weeks' gestation. Serial ultrasonography and follow-up neonatal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a solitary splenic cyst. The finding of asymptomatic but potentially serious fetal lesions allows optimum management of the newborn infant and adds to the benefits of antenatal sonography. 
Ovulation induction by step-down administration of purified urinary follicle-stimulating hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. The step-down method can be an alternative method of ovulation induction in women with PCOS. This protocol can induce ovulation with a smaller dose of FSH and with lower incidence of excessive ovarian enlargement in comparison with the traditional fixed-dose administration method. 
Human hepatocyte growth factor in blood of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. I. Clinical aspects. The levels of human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) in sera obtained from patients with various liver diseases were determined using adult rat hepatocytes maintained in primary culture. The mean hHGF activity for 22 patients with fulminant hepatic failure was about nine times greater than that found in normal human serum. The increase in serum hHGF activity seen in two patients with "acute-on-chronic" hepatitis was similar to that found in patients with fulminant hepatic failure. The serum level of hHGF from patients with acute hepatitis is related to the stage of their illness. The average value for 31 patients was about three times that of normal human serum. In some patients, the time course for the increase in serum hHGF activity was similar to that demonstrated for alpha-fetoprotein. The mean hHGF activity in serum for the 33 patients with chronic hepatitis and from 25 patients with liver cirrhosis was increased also compared with that of normal human serum. In addition, serum hHGF activity in three of seven patients studied after partial hepatectomy for a space-occupying lesion of the liver was increased. These data suggest that the increase in serum hHGF activity present in patients with various liver diseases reflects a self-defense mechanism that is involved in the process of liver cell regeneration. 
PUVA-induced lymphomatoid papulosis in a patient with mycosis fungoides. The occurrence of lymphomatoid papulosis in patients with cutaneous lymphoma, particularly mycosis fungoides, has been described in medical literature. A 68-year-old woman affected by mycosis fungoides in the plaque stage noticed that multiple papulonodular lesions of lymphomatoid papulosis developed suddenly after a few sessions of PUVA therapy. The PUVA induction of lymphomatoid papulosis was confirmed by the appearance of new lesions after a second cycle of PUVA exposure on a limited area of the body. Complete regression of all PUVA-induced lymphomatoid papulosis lesions was achieved within a few weeks with oral prednisone and topical steroids. During the entire treatment the patches and plaques of mycosis fungoides persisted unchanged. 
Possible Behcet's disease revealed by pulmonary aneurysms. Behcet's disease (BD) is a multisystem disease which may affect many organ systems in addition to the originally described triple symptom complex. Pulmonary aneurysm is one of the rare complications of the disease. We report a case of bilateral pulmonary aneurysm in which usual criteria for the clinical diagnosis of BD were absent and we believe that pulmonary aneurysm could be the first appearance of the disease. 
Ophthalmoplegia with headache. Be aware of diabetes. Cranial neuropathy affecting the eyes is a possible symptom of type II diabetes. In this article, Dr Dickerman describes a case in which diabetes was diagnosed in a 63-year-old woman who presented with unilateral headache and eye pain. 
Pulmonary and chest wall mechanics in anesthetized paralyzed humans. Pulmonary and chest wall mechanics were studied in 18 anesthetized paralyzed supine humans by use of the technique of rapid airway occlusion during constant-flow inflation. Analysis of the changes in transpulmonary pressure after flow interruption allowed partitioning of the overall resistance of the lung (RL) into two compartments, one (Rint,L) reflecting airway resistance and the other (delta RL) representing the viscoelastic properties of the pulmonary tissues. Similar analysis of the changes in esophageal pressure indicates that chest wall resistance (RW) was due entirely to the viscoelastic properties of the chest wall tissues (delta RW = RW). In line with previous measurements of airway resistance, Rint,L increased with increasing flow and decreased with increasing volume. The opposite was true for both delta RL and delta RW. This behavior was interpreted in terms of a viscoelastic model that allowed computation of the viscoelastic constants of the lung and chest wall. This model also accounts for frequency, volume, and flow dependence of elastance of the lung and chest wall. Static and dynamic elastances, as well as delta R, were higher for the lung than for the chest wall. 
Randomised study of antiepileptic drug withdrawal in patients in remission. Medical Research Council Antiepileptic Drug Withdrawal Study Group A prospective multicentre randomised study of continued antiepileptic treatment vs slow withdrawal was conducted in 1013 patients who had been free of seizures for at least 2 years. Comparison of randomised and eligible, but non-randomised, patients suggests the results should be applicable to a wider patient population. By 2 years after randomisation, 78% of patients in whom treatment was continued and 59% of those in whom it was withdrawn remained seizure free, but thereafter the differences between the two groups diminished. Non-compliance with continued treatment accounted for only a small proportion of the risk to the group continuing with treatment. The most important factors determining outcome were longer seizure-free periods (reducing the risk) and more than one antiepileptic drug and a history of tonic-clonic seizures (increasing the risk). Other factors (eg, history of neonatal seizures, specific electroencephalographic features) seemed to have smaller effects, but even in such a large study the confidence intervals for these observations were wide. 
Comparison of monoclonal immunocytochemical and immunoenzymatic methods for steroid receptor evaluation in breast cancer. The production of monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) has permitted the development of the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and immunocytochemical assay (ICA) for steroid receptor determination. The results obtained with these two techniques, using the same monoclonal antibodies, were compared in a large series of breast carcinomas (187 for ER and 100 for PR). The correlation between these methods was significant for ER (rs = 0.54) and PR (rs = 0.55) (P less than 0.001) but was lost when the receptor concentrations determined by EIA were less than or equal to 15 and less than or equal to 30 fmol/mg protein for ER and PR, respectively. When these values are considered as cutoffs, the concordance between the two methods was 84.5% for ER and 73% for PR. An analysis of discordant results revealed that low epithelial cellularity generally was present in ICA-positive, EIA-negative specimens, whereas only focal positivity with ICA, or positivity of only normal peripheral mammary ducts and lobules, frequently was found in ICA-negative, EIA-positive tumors. In conclusion, there is good correlation between the results obtained by EIA and ICA methods for detection of ER and PR. The authors suggest that biochemical and histochemical methods for steroid receptors could be considered complementary and used together for the analysis of breast cancer. 
Comparison of muscle sympathetic responses to hemorrhage and lower body negative pressure in humans. We compared changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) during graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP) and 450 ml of hemorrhage in nine healthy volunteers. During LBNP, central venous pressure (CVP) decreased from 6.1 +/- 0.4 to 4.5 +/- 0.5 (LBNP -5 mmHg), 3.4 +/- 0.6 (LBNP -10 mmHg), and 2.3 +/- 0.6 mmHg (LBNP -15 mmHg), and there were progressive increases in SNA at each level of LBNP. The slope relating percent change in SNA to change in CVP during LBNP (mean +/- SE) was 27 +/- 11%/mmHg. Hemorrhage of 450 ml at a mean rate of 71 +/- 5 ml/min decreased CVP from 6.1 +/- 0.5 to 3.7 +/- 0.5 mmHg and increased SNA by 47 +/- 11%. The increase in SNA during hemorrhage was not significantly different from the increase in SNA predicted by the slope relating percent change in SNA to change in CVP during LBNP. These data show that nonhypotensive hemorrhage causes sympathoexcitation and that sympathetic responses to LBNP and nonhypotensive hemorrhage are similar in humans. 
Mesenteric vein thrombosis associated with a familial deficiency of free protein S. Signs and symptoms of an acute intra-abdominal emergency developed in a 26-year-old man; this emergency prompted surgical exploration. It was discovered that he had a devitalized small bowel as a result of mesenteric vein thrombosis. An extensive evaluation for hypercoagulable states disclosed that he had a normal total protein S concentration, but by assay and on crossed immunoelectrophoresis studies, he had a decreased concentration of free protein S. A family study demonstrated protein S deficiency in his father and in a sister. On a subsequent determination, the propositus had a decreased concentration of total protein S. This case illustrates the association of protein S deficiency with mesenteric thrombosis and serves to caution that a single determination of total protein S is not an adequate evaluation when the index of suspicion for a hypercoagulable state is high. 
Cocaine-associated chest pain. STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical and ECG features of cocaine abusers evaluated in the emergency department and admitted to the medical coronary care unit with chest pain consistent with myocardial ischemia. DESIGN: A four-month retrospective review of all cocaine abusers who presented to the ED with chest pain and a diagnosis of possible myocardial infarction. SETTING: Urban county hospital. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-eight adult cocaine abusers admitted with chest pain. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Patients included 34 men and 14 women with a mean age of 29 +/- 7.3 years. The average duration of cocaine abuse in 28 patients for whom it was reported was 5 +/- 4.8 years. Chest pain occurred within one hour of cocaine abuse in 13 admissions (27%), more than one hour after abuse in 13 admissions (27%), and it was not recorded in 23 admissions (47%). Initial ECGs were evaluated in all patients and revealed significant repolarization abnormalities consisting of abnormal ST segment elevations in 18 (37%) and T-wave inversions in 20 (41%) that often persisted on subsequent ECGs. Three patients sustained acute myocardial infarctions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm a small but significant incidence of myocardial infarction in cocaine abusers presenting to the ED with chest pain. The chronicity of cocaine abuse, the persistence of ECG abnormalities, and the variable temporal relationship of chest pain to cocaine abuse suggest possible chronic myocardial changes as etiologies of ischemia. 
Inhibition of early atherogenesis in transgenic mice by human apolipoprotein AI. Epidemiological surveys have identified a strong inverse relationship between the amount in the plasma of high density lipoproteins (HDL), apolipoprotein AI (ApoA-I), the major protein component of HDL, and the risk for atherosclerosis in humans. It is not known if this relationship arises from a direct antiatherogenic effect of these plasma components or if it is the result of other factors also associated with increases in ApoA-I and HDL levels. Because some strains of mice are susceptible to diet-induced formation of preatherosclerotic fatty streak lesions, and because of available techniques for the genetic manipulation of this organism, the murine system offers a unique setting in which to investigate the process of early atherogenesis. To test the hypothesis that induction of a high plasma concentration of ApoA-I and HDL would inhibit this process, we studied the effects of atherogenic diets on transgenic mice expressing high amounts of human ApoA-I. We report that transgenic mice with high plasma ApoA-I and HDL levels were significantly protected from the development of fatty streak lesions. 
Congenital mitral regurgitation associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage. Report of a rare combination. A case of congenital mitral regurgitation associated with total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, successfully treated surgically, is reported. To our knowledge, this combination has not been reported in the literature. 
Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy: detection of abnormal gallbladder motor function in patients with chronic acalculous gallbladder disease. CCK cholescintigrams were performed in 374 patients with recurrent postprandial right upper quadrant pain, biliary colic, and a normal gallbladder sonogram and/or cholecystogram. The results of these examinations were correlated with the patients' final medical/surgical diagnoses. Twenty-seven patients recruited as control volunteers without objective clinical evidence of biliary disease also underwent CCK cholescintigraphy to determine if the degree of gallbladder contraction post-CCK differs in symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects. Decreased gallbladder motor function was identified (maximal gallbladder ejection fraction response to CCK less than 35%) in 94% of patients with histopathologically confirmed chronic acalculous cholecystitis or the cystic duct syndrome and in 88% of patients clinically believed to have chronic acalculous biliary disease. Decreased gallbladder motor function does not distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic gallbladder disease. 
DNA/RNA content and proliferative fractions of colorectal carcinomas: a five-year prospective study relating flow cytometry to survival. In our prospective study, flow cytometric analysis of cellular DNA and RNA content was performed on unfixed fresh specimens of colorectal adenocarcinoma taken from 176 patients. Of the 176 tumors, 113 (64%) were aneuploid. There was no correlation between aneuploidy and tumor stage, grade, location, or size. After a median follow-up of 5.6 years, no correlation between DNA or RNA content and patient survival was found. DNA content alone was not an independent prognostic factor when the colorectal carcinomas were segregated by curable and incurable stages. However, normal mucosa, diploid tumors, and aneuploid tumors showed progressively higher proliferation and higher RNA and DNA indices. Proliferative fraction--defined as the percentage of cells in S + G2 and M phases of the cell cycle--was significantly related to ploidy and to Dukes' stage. Despite these correlations, we did not detect a significant influence of proliferative fraction on survival when patients were segregated above or below the mean proliferative fraction for all tumors. More accurate methods of identifying the proliferative fraction of tumor cells are currently being pursued. While the role of flow cytometry in the evaluation and management of patients with colorectal carcinoma is still undefined for a number of other cellular parameters, it seems unlikely that DNA index, RNA index, or the proliferative fractions calculated from the DNA histogram, will, of themselves, represent independent prognostic factors. 
Nutrition and alcoholic liver disease. While the rate of malnutrition is relatively modest in alcoholic patients without alcoholic liver disease, the rate of malnutrition is virtually 100% in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and/or alcoholic cirrhosis. The reasons for malnutrition in the alcoholic hepatitis patient include various factors such as anorexia, poor diet, malabsorption, and altered metabolic state. When the patient is hospitalized, the malnutrition frequently worsens because of fasting for tests, continued anorexia, and complications such as gastrointestinal bleeding. Patients with severe acute hepatitis appear to be both hypermetabolic and hypercatabolic, whereas data are much more conflicting concerning patients with more stable liver disease. Most studies suggest that patients with alcoholic liver disease require at least 60 g of protein per day to maintain positive nitrogen balance. Consistent alterations in plasma amino acid profiles occur in alcoholic liver disease, and specialized nutritional formulations have been devised to correct this amino acid profile with the intent of improving overall nutritional status, hepatic encephalopathy, and mortality. The effects of nutritional support (including use of specialized products) on outcome, on acute hepatic encephalopathy, and on chronic or latent portal systemic encephalopathy are reviewed. 
The hospital costs of diagnostic procedures for colorectal cancer. Diagnosis for colorectal cancer is commonly made using either colonoscopy or double contrast barium enema techniques. To data, little attention has been paid to the comparative costs of these two procedures and the paper presents estimates of hospital costs for each, using data from the colorectal study being undertaken in Nottingham, U.K. Consideration is also given to procedure sensitivity and the frequency of referral to the alternative technique in cases of incomplete diagnosis. The paper presents the conditions under which a given technique may be considered cost-superior to its alternative but concludes that the absence of conclusive clinical trial data and other considerations precludes the identification of a definitively optimum technique from the economic point of view. 
Eyelid leishmaniasis in a patient with neurogenic ptosis. A patient with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis of the upper eyelid. Infection of this site is rare because eyelid movements usually prevent the sandfly vector from biting the skin there. It is postulated that the relative immobility of the upper eyelid in this patient was a major predisposing factor for the infection. 
Relationships between block-of-twitch and train-of-four fade in the mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation. The relationships between the block-of-twitch and train-of-four fade in the presence of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (d-tubocurarine, vecuronium and pancuronium) were examined in vitro by measuring the contractile tension from mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations. The slope of the block/fade relationship differed between onset of and recovery from neuromuscular block following single doses of d-tubocurarine, vecuronium or pancuronium. Decreasing the dose of d-tubocurarine or using a divided dose technique to accelerate onset (i.e., priming) increased the amount of fade for a given amount of block. In addition, the block/fade relationships for cumulative dosing and sequential dilution were the same when measurements were made at steady-state for several doses. It is concluded that the block/fade relationship in the mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation is variable, and is related to the time course of the neuromuscular block. In addition, the block/fade relationships for d-tubocurarine, vecuronium and pancuronium did not differ when determined at steady-state. 
Recurrent aortic graft infection following descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass. A case report and review. This paper presents a patient who developed a recurrent aortic graft infection after a descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass. The patient had previously undergone successful management of an infected aortobifemoral bypass by removal of the graft and revascularization of the lower extremities with axillofemoral bypasses. A general discussion of the management of infected aortic grafts is presented and a discussion of the management of this particular patient is presented in detail. 
Chronic periaortitis presenting as common bile duct obstruction. The case of a 67 year old woman is reported who presented with cholestatic jaundice and was found to have, in addition, an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Only at necropsy did histopathology show chronic periaortitis as the aetiology of a pancreatic head mass which, during life, mimicked a pancreatic neoplasm obstructing the bile and pancreatic ducts. 
Long-term follow-up of slipped capital femoral epiphysis. The data on 155 hips in 124 patients who had slipped capital femoral epiphysis were retrospectively reviewed at a mean follow-up of forty-one years after the onset of symptoms. The slips were classified, by the duration of symptoms, as acute, chronic, or acute on chronic. As determined by the head-shaft angle, 42 per cent of the slips were mild; 32 per cent, moderate; and 26 per cent, severe. Reduction was performed in thirty-nine hips, and realignment was done in sixty-five hips. Treatment of chronic slips included symptomatic only in 25 per cent of the hips, a spica cast in 30 per cent, pinning in 24 per cent, and osteotomy in 20 per cent. The Iowa hip-rating and the radiographic classification of degenerative joint disease were determined at follow-up; both worsened with increasing severity of the slip and when reduction or realignment had been done. Osteonecrosis (12 per cent) and chondrolysis (16 per cent) also were more common with increasing severity of the slip and when reduction or realignment had been performed; both led to a poor result. Deterioration over time was most marked with increasing severity of the slip. The natural history of the malunited slip is mild deterioration related to the severity of the slip and complications. Techniques of realignment are associated with a risk of appreciable complications and adversely affect the natural history of the disease. Regardless of the severity of the slip, pinning in situ provided the best long-term function and delay of degenerative arthritis, with a low risk of complications. 
Hydroxyethyl starch macromolecule and superoxide dismutase effects on myocardial reperfusion injury. Myocardial reperfusion injury may be due to biophysical changes (e.g., endothelial cell junctional separations), as well as biochemical mechanisms (e.g., oxygen free radical activity). Superoxide dismutase (SOD), a free radical scavenger, may be effective in reducing chemical injury. Fractions of hydroxyethyl starch (HES-Pz), a large macromolecule, have been shown to decrease microvascular permeability associated with reperfusion-induced biophysical alterations. A comparison of SOD to HES-Pz was performed using a canine model of 1-hour left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) clamping followed by 24 hours of reperfusion. Amounts of the test solution equal to 10% of the dog's blood volume were administered intraatrially to the animals just before release of the LAD clamp. Six dogs received Ringer's lactate, 7 were given 600,000 IU of SOD, 13 received 6% HES-Pz, and 9 were given SOD and HES-Pz. The ratio of infarct to area at risk was 20 +/- 3% in the control dogs receiving Ringer's lactate, 16 +/- 4% in animals receiving SOD alone (p = NS), 6 +/- 3% in dogs receiving HES-Pz alone (p less than 0.05), and 8 +/- 3% in dogs given a combination of SOD and HES-Pz (p less than 0.05). HES-Pz alone and with SOD significantly reduced reperfusion injury, although addition of SOD to HES-Pz did not have an additive effect. Appropriate-sized macromolecules may act by reducing ischemia-induced microvascular permeability. 
Epidemiology of subarachnoid hemorrhage in Finland from 1983 to 1985. The age-standardized incidence of subarachnoid hemorrhage was 33/100,000/yr among Finnish men and 25/100,000/yr among Finnish women. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represented 11% of all strokes detected during 1983-1985 in the community-based stroke register in three areas of Finland. Age-standardized mortality from subarachnoid hemorrhage was 18/100,000/yr among men and 12/100,000/yr among women aged 25-74 years, representing in men 22% and in women 23% of all deaths from stroke in the register. The case-fatality rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage was high: 35% among men and 33% among women within 2 days after the onset of the stroke attack and 48% in men and 46% in women at 1 month. Our findings suggest that the incidence and mortality of subarachnoid hemorrhage in Finland are among the highest worldwide, although differences in criteria, study methods, and classification procedures reduce the comparability of studies from different countries. The occurrence of subarachnoid hemorrhage in our present study is also higher than that previously reported in this country. We believe that this is more likely due to changes in diagnostic classification and improvements in detection of the disease than to a real increase in the morbidity and mortality of subarachnoid hemorrhage. 
Neural network analysis of serial cardiac enzyme data. A clinical application of artificial machine intelligence. There has been a recent resurgence of interest in the study and application of computerized neural networks within the broad field of artificial intelligence. These "intelligent machines" are modeled after biological nervous systems and are fundamentally different from the many computerized expert systems that previously have been introduced as clinical decision-making aids. The authors describe a neural network designed and trained to predict the probability of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) based on the analysis of paired sets of cardiac enzymes. The neural network predicted 24 of 24 (100%) AMIs and 27 of 29 (93%) No-AMIs when compared with a pathologist's interpretation of the patient's laboratory data (P less than 0.000001). The authors attempted to validate the network's diagnoses by two independent methods. When compared with echocardiogram and EKG for diagnosis of AMI, the neural network agreed with the cardiologist's interpretation in 12 of 14 (86%) AMIs and 1 of 3 (33%) No-AMIs, but the correlation was not statistically significant. Using autopsy outcome for validation, the neural network agreed with the anatomic evidence in 24 of 26 (92%) AMIs and 4 of 6 (67%) No-AMIs (P = 0.001). The authors conclude that neural networks can be successfully applied to the analysis of cardiac enzyme data and suggest that broader applications exist within the domain of clinical decision support. 
Bilateral retinal hamartomas in neurofibromatosis type 2. We report a case of bilateral retinal hamartomas in a child with neurofibromatosis type 2. This unique case demonstrates that a diversity of retinal changes can occur in this disease. 
New technique of esophageal exclusion for chronic esophageal perforation. A new technique of near-total esophageal exclusion was used successfully in the treatment of 2 patients with chronic thoracic esophageal perforation and continuing sepsis. The most striking point of this technique is the use of cervical T-tube esophagostomy with the lower arm of the T tube circumfixed by chromic catgut tie to prevent swallowing of saliva. Whereas most of the previously reported procedures of cervical esophageal diversion require subsequent esophageal reconstruction, this technique is simple and effective and does not require a second operation. 
MR imaging of CSF-like choroidal fissure and parenchymal cysts of the brain. The purposes of this study were to delineate the MR characteristics of CSF-like parenchymal or fissural cysts of the brain and to correlate them with the clinical findings. Clinical data and MR images of 34 patients with these abnormalities were reviewed. Pathologic correlation was not available. Two types of cystic lesions were identified and separated by location: medial temporal lobe cysts arising in or near the choroidal fissure (26 patients) and parenchymal or pseudoparenchymal cysts not related to the choroidal fissure (eight patients). The choroidal fissure cysts simulated intraparenchymal cysts on axial images but their extraaxial location was well portrayed on the coronal images. Choroidal fissure cysts had a characteristic spindle shape on sagittal images. The other cysts were found in the temporal lobe (seven patients) or thalamus (one patient) and appeared parenchymal but situated close to the subarachnoid space. These lesions were round or ovoid. There was no abnormal enhancement in 10 patients studied with gadopentetate dimeglumine. Coronal images were most useful, revealing the cysts as focal CSF-intensity lesions expanding the choroidal fissure of the temporal lobe. All the cysts appeared to represent incidental findings that did not correlate with the clinical signs and/or symptoms that prompted the imaging evaluations. The MR characteristics of CSF-like cysts are important to recognize so that they are not confused with other, more serious entities, such as intraaxial cystic tumors, infarctions, or parasitic lesions. 
Beneficial effects of isovolemic hemodilution using a perfluorocarbon emulsion in a stroke model. In a clinically applicable cat stroke model, 16 purpose-bred adult animals were used to evaluate the beneficial effects of two treatment regimens: isovolemic hemodilution with either a perfluorocarbon emulsion or dextran 40 (a glucose polymer). Animals that received these treatment regimens were then compared with a control group of untreated animals. Focal cerebral infarctions were produced by transorbital ligation of the left middle cerebral artery. The randomly allocated treatment arms of the study were instituted 3 hours after ligation of the middle cerebral artery, thereby simulating a human clinical situation. In vivo mitochondrial metabolic activity of the peri-infarct cerebral tissue was continually assessed by means of a multiwavelength near-infrared spectrophotometer. This allowed measurement of cellular oxygenation at the cytochrome aa3 level, the terminal member of the cytochrome chain. Sequential proton-based magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure intracerebral water in vivo. Cardiac output, oxygen consumption/delivery, chemical, histologic, and rheologic parameters were also assessed. The data collected were analyzed by group means and standard statistical analyses, which revealed that the group treated with the perfluorocarbon emulsion had both less brain edema in the early post-infarct period (p less than 0.05), as well as a higher level of oxidation of cytochrome aa3 (p less than or equal to 0.025). This evidence supports the premise that isovolemic hemodilution with an oxygen-carrying hemodiluent may be beneficial in the treatment of ischemic strokes. 
Evolution of endoscopic urethropexy: seven-year experience with various techniques. The surgical techniques for correction of stress urinary incontinence continues to evolve particularly those utilizing the endoscopic approach. Various forms of endoscopic urethropexy have been performed in 142 women with a minimum of one-year follow-up. The cure rate for the entire series was 94 percent. In the last two years the no-incision technique was used whenever feasible (31 patients) with an identical cure rate of 94 percent. Varying degrees of urinary retention occurred in 58 percent and was even more prevalent following the no-incision technique (68%). Owing to the high incidence of urinary retention a punch suprapubic cystostomy is now used in most patients. We conclude that endoscopic urethropexy is an effective means of correcting stress urinary incontinence. The no-incision technique is associated with even less morbidity and a reduction in hospital stay without compromising the outcome. 
Successful treatment of hepatosplenic candidiasis with a liposomal amphotericin B preparation. The case of a granulocytopenic patient with acute undifferentiated leukaemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who was refractory to conventional deoxycholate amphotericin B (AmpB) and 5-flucytosine therapy is reported. He experienced severe AmpB-related side-effects, and was subsequently successfully treated with a pharmaceutical preparation of AmpB (5.7 g) entrapped in sonicated liposomes, composed of lecithin, cholesterol and stearylamine in a molar ratio of 4:3:1. Three months later, during maintenance chemotherapy, liposomal AmpB (5.1 g) was reinstituted due to the finding of biopsies positive for Candida albicans at bronchoscopy. After healing of the patient's fungal infection a left upper lobe resection was performed, which showed advanced fibrosis with signs of inflammation, but no evidence of fungal disease. Since no acute side-effects and only moderate hypokalaemia were observed, it appears that liposomal AmpB is superior to conventional AmpB treatment in granulocytopenic patients with hepatosplenic candidiasis and unbearable therapy-related side-effects. 
Rasmussen encephalitis: epilepsia partialis continua secondary to chronic encephalitis. Rasmussen encephalitis is a disease consisting of chronic encephalitis with progressive neurologic deficits and focal intractable seizure activity. The etiology is unknown, but pathologic specimens revealed changes consistent with viral encephalitis. Even though neuro-imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, offer the prospect of specific, presurgical diagnostic criteria, the initial diagnosis usually is made on a clinical basis. Treatment modalities, including a wide variety of antiepileptic drug therapies and surgical interventions, may result in significant physical and mental impairments. We summarize the clinical presentation, diagnostic considerations, and different treatment protocols in a patient with this rare and debilitating disorder. 
Chronic inflammation is associated with an increased proportion of goblet cells recovered by bronchial lavage. To evaluate the possibility that bronchoalveolar lavage could provide sufficient respiratory epithelial cells to quantify changes in epithelial cell types associated with chronic inflammation, we examined the epithelial cells obtained in the first infused (20 ml) aliquots that were processed separately from later aliquots, a process known to enrich for bronchial contents. Epithelial cells, including ciliated cells, goblet cells, and fragments of desquamated epithelium, were easily identified after preparation by cytocentrifugation and staining with a modified Giemsa stain. Quantification of the columnar cell types revealed that those with chronic bronchitis and asymptomatic smokers have increased goblet cells as a percentage of the total columnar epithelial cells (chronic bronchitics 36 +/- 2 percent, asymptomatic smokers 22 +/- 2 percent) compared with normal subjects (9 +/- 1 percent, p less than 0.001, ANOVA). Significantly, the goblet cell percentage was strongly correlated with other measures of bronchitis and measures of airflow obstruction such as the bronchitis index, a visually derived score at bronchoscopy of airway inflammation (r = 0.72, p less than 0.001), the percent neutrophils in the first infused aliquots (r = 0.44, p less than 0.05), and the FEV1 percent (r = -0.74, p less than 0.001). Thus, bronchoalveolar lavage is capable of providing sufficient bronchial epithelial cells for analysis, and the changes seen in the spectrum of columnar epithelial cells may reflect important underlying pathologic changes. 
Oromandibular reconstruction using microvascular composite free flaps. Report of 71 cases and a new classification scheme for bony, soft-tissue, and neurologic defects. We describe 71 cases of oromandibular reconstruction using microvascular composite free flaps. There was an overall flap success rate of 94%, while 97% of the patients in this series had their mandibles reconstructed with free vascularized bone flaps. Fifteen patients were rehabilitated with implant-borne dental prostheses. Primary repair of discontinuity defects of the inferior-alveolar nerve using a variety of nerve grafts was performed in 16 patients. A new classification scheme for composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone, soft tissue, and neurologic defects is proposed and applied in the description of each of the patients in this series. 
Trisomy 12 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: an interphase cytogenetic study. Interphase cytogenetics by means of in situ hybridization with the chromosome 12-specific biotinylated alpha satellite DNA probe pSP 12-1 was used for the study of trisomy 12, the most common chromosomal abnormality in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In situ hybridization was performed on methanol/acetic acid fixed cells of conventional cytogenetic preparations from eight patients and on morphologically and immunologically classified cells of cytospin preparations from seven patients. The results show that trisomy 12 is more common than assumed on the basis of karyotype analysis of metaphase chromosomes: 2 of 13 patients with a normal karyotype in G-banding analysis were shown to have trisomy 12 by interphase cytogenetics. Immunophenotyping of the cells of one patient showed that the trisomy was restricted to cells with Ig light chain clonality. For the evaluation of the prognostic, therapeutic, and biologic significance of trisomy 12, in situ hybridization should be used in parallel with karyotype analysis because it allows the study of all cell populations of both interphase and mitotic cells, whether neoplastic or normal. 
Masseter muscle spasm in children: implications of continuing the triggering anesthetic. This retrospective study was undertaken to examine the management and outcome of children who developed isolated masseter muscle spasm (MMS) after the administration of intravenous succinylcholine during anesthetic induction. The inhalation anesthetics used for induction were continued in all of these cases. The medical records of 68 patients (male/female ratio, 1.7:1), identified from approximately 42,000 anesthetics given during the period 1980-1989, were reviewed. Fifty-seven children (2.3-12 yr old) were diagnosed as having isolated MMS, i.e., MMS without spasm of other muscles; 11 experienced generalized rigidity in combination with MMS. Anesthetic and postoperative management of these two groups differed. The overall incidence of MMS was 0.3% of inhalation anesthetics during which succinylcholine was given. Intraoperative arrhythmias occurred in 33% of the patients who developed isolated MMS and more frequently in older children. Most children experienced some degree of hypercarbia and/or metabolic acidosis, but the significance of these abnormalities in the spontaneously ventilating, fasting child is unknown. Serum creatine kinase levels when measured 18-24 h postoperatively were elevated in all but one child (n = 45). There was no long-term morbidity and no mortality. We conclude that failure of the masseter muscles to relax after succinylcholine is not uncommon in children. Based on our experience, and accepting that MMS may be part of the clinical spectrum of malignant hyperthermia, we believe that anesthesia can be continued safely in cases of isolated MMS when careful monitoring accompanies diagnostic evaluation. This differs from the current practice of discontinuing the anesthetic or switching to a nontriggering anesthetic technique. 
Osteomyelitis: characteristics and pitfalls of diagnosis with MR imaging. Prospective and retrospective magnetic resonance (MR) imaging (0.35-T) interpretations were compared with final diagnoses in 110 patients suspected to have osteomyelitis. Diagnostic criteria of dark marrow on T1-weighted images and bright marrow on short-tau inversion-recovery images yielded a prospective sensitivity of 98% and a prospective specificity of 75%. Sixty percent of uncomplicated septic joint effusions demonstrated abnormal marrow signal intensity that was mistaken for osteomyelitis. Retrospective review revealed that overall specificity could be improved to 82% without loss of sensitivity if increased marrow signal intensity on T2-weighted images were included as an additional criterion. Specificity may be further increased by use of knowledge of morphologic patterns that distinguish various forms of osteomyelitis. Ten patients (9%) had potential pitfall diagnoses (eg, fracture, infarction, healed infection) that mimic osteomyelitis. MR imaging can be sensitive and specific for osteomyelitis if characteristic appearances and pitfall diagnoses are incorporated into the diagnostic criteria. 
Genetic linkage of autosomal recessive canine narcolepsy with a mu immunoglobulin heavy-chain switch-like segment. Identification of genes determining narcolepsy susceptibility is important not only for understanding that disorder but also for possible clues to general sleep-control mechanisms. Studies in humans reveal at least one such gene related to the major histocompatibility complex and in dog an as-yet-unmapped single, autosomal recessive gene canarc-1. Gene markers for canarc-1 were therefore sought by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms in our colony of narcoleptic dogs. A human mu-switch immunoglobulin probe and the enzyme Hae III identified a gene cosegregating with canarc-1 in backcrossed animals (logarithm of odds scores: m = 24, Z max = 7.2 at theta = 0%). canarc-1 was also shown not to be tightly linked with the dog major histocompatibility complex (m = 40, Z less than -2 at theta less than 4.8%). These results represent the mapping of a non-major histocompatibility complex narcolepsy gene and strongly suggest involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of that disease. 
Aortic-ventricular tunnel in a neonate: diagnosis and management based on cross sectional and colour Doppler ultrasonography. A five day old symptom free neonate was referred for assessment of a to and fro murmur associated with large volume pulses. Cross sectional echocardiography and colour flow mapping confirmed the diagnosis of an aortic-ventricular tunnel with forward flow into the aorta and regurgitant flow into the ventricle through both the tunnel and the dilated aortic valve ring. Surgical correction by patch closure of the aortic end of the tunnel was successfully undertaken two weeks later without any additional investigations. Postoperative echocardiography and colour flow imaging showed no aortic regurgitation and normal left ventricular dimensions and function. 
Arm edema in conservatively managed breast cancer: obesity is a major predictive factor To identify risk factors in the development of arm edema (AE) after conservative management of breast cancer, the authors prospectively measured differences in upper and lower arm circumference in 282 patients with stage I or II breast cancer who received radiation. AE was defined as a difference of 2.5 cm or more in either measurement between treated and untreated arms. Median follow-up was 37 months (range, 7-109 months). The crude frequency of AE overall was 19.5% (55 patients). In 21 patients (7.4%) AE was transient; 34 patients (12.1%) had persistent AE, which is the focus of this article. The 5-year actuarial incidence of persistent AE was 16%. The crude risk of persistent severe AE was 3.9%. Various factors were examined for their ability to enable prediction of AE. Treatment-related factors did not significantly enable prediction of AE, whereas factors related to patient size, such as body mass index, were strongly associated with both the frequency and severity of AE. 
Health maintenance strategies for women of different ages. An overview. Preventive health strategies for screening for specific illnesses, counseling, and immunization are discussed. Emphasis is given to cardiovascular screening and risk reduction, screening for malignancies, and immunization practices. A framework for designing periodic health examinations for patients is detailed. 
Patient dose and associated risk due to radiological investigation of the internal auditory meatus. The radiation doses and associated somatic risks due to four radiological examinations for acoustic neuromata (AN) have been investigated. These examinations were (1) plain film radiography of the internal auditory meatus (IAM), (2) computed tomography (CT) of the IAM, (3) CT of the posterior fossa and (4) CT of the IAM with air contrast. Organ dose measurements were performed using lithium fluoride thermoluminescent dosemeters loaded in a patient equivalent phantom. Dose equivalents to various organs are presented, together with the effective dose equivalent and collective effective dose equivalent for each examination. Hypothetical fatal somatic risks for each examination studied here have been estimated from the effective dose equivalents. The estimated number of hypothetical fatal cancers induced by radiological examinations for AN is between approximately 110 and 820 times lower than the number of detected AN, depending on the method of assessing the radiation dose to the remainder organs. It is concluded that in this particular study the radiological examinations are of net benefit to this group of patients. 
Edematous pancreatitis associated with intravenous pentamidine. A 37-year-old black man with presumed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who was treated with systemic IV pentamidine had fatal pancreatitis and massive hepatomegaly. Fatal pancreatitis can occur with no hemorrhagic changes seen at autopsy. Awareness of the relationship between pentamidine and pancreatitis should be emphasized. With current clinical trials testing other routes of administration, fatal complications associated with IV pentamidine therapy will be minimized. 
Vegetative state after closed-head injury. A Traumatic Coma Data Bank Report. To elucidate the clinical course of the vegetative state after severe closed-head injury, the Traumatic Coma Data Bank was analyzed for outcome at the time of discharge from the hospital and after follow-up intervals ranging up to 3 years after injury. Of 650 patients with closed-head injury available for analysis, 93 (14%) were discharged in a vegetative state. In comparison with conscious survivors, patients in a vegetative state sustained more severe closed-head injury as reflected by the Glasgow Coma Scale scores and pupillary findings and more frequently had diffuse injury complicated by swelling or shift in midline structures. Of 84 patients in a vegetative state who provided follow-up data, 41% became conscious by 6 months, 52% regained consciousness by 1 year, and 58% recovered consciousness within the 3-year follow-up interval. A logistic regression failed to identify predictors of recovery from the vegetative state. 
Relationships between requests for psychiatric consultations and psychiatric diagnoses in long-term-care facilities. OBJECTIVE: The authors' objective was to investigate reasons for referral of elderly nursing home residents for psychiatric consultation and the relationship of these reasons for referral to psychiatric diagnoses. METHOD: They examined 197 nursing home residents consecutively referred to a consulting team in a university-affiliated mental health center. These patients represented all patients evaluated by the consulting team at six nursing homes over a 2-year period (Sept. 1, 1984, through Aug. 30, 1986). RESULTS: Reasons for referral were diverse but fell into seven broad clusters: behavioral problems; mood-related problems; consultations requested by involuntary treatment services, patients, physicians, or other referring agencies; psychotic features; physical signs; impaired activities of daily living; and other. Behavioral problems were most commonly cited and tended to be associated with dementia diagnoses. Mood-related reasons for referral were most strongly associated with diagnoses of affective disorders, and diagnoses of schizophrenia and adjustment disorder were each associated with two or more reasons for referral. However, reasons for referral were distributed widely across diagnostic groups and were relatively weak predictors of diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: The results illustrate the variety of problems for which nursing home staff are willing to seek psychiatric consultation but emphasize the need for professional psychiatric evaluation to establish a diagnostic base on which treatment interventions can be built. 
A simple sore throat? Retropharyngeal emphysema secondary to free-basing cocaine. A case of retropharyngeal emphysema associated with drug abuse is presented. Although chest symptoms of pneumomediastinum have been widely reported with substance abuse, pain localized to the neck is rarely described. In the present case, localized dysphagia was the only complaint, and no free air could be demonstrated within the thorax. For uncomplicated cervical emphysema or pneumomediastinum due to substance abuse, extensive workup may be unnecessary, and conservative therapy, including administration of 100% oxygen and observation is recommended if resolution is prompt. 
Composition of fat in enteral diets can influence outcome in experimental peritonitis. An animal model of protracted acute peritonitis was used to study the effects on survival of different amounts and types of dietary fat. Guinea pigs (n = 132) were provided with gastrostomies and allowed to recover. Intraperitoneal osmotic pumps were then placed, allowing for effusion of viable bacteria during the next week. Three days after pump implantation, the animals were randomized to receive one of nine diets, differing only in fat content (3.5%, 14%, or 56% of total calories) and fat composition (100% Microlipid [primarily safflower oil, rich in linoleic acid], 100% MaxEPA [fish oil containing 35% omega-three fatty acids], or a 50:50 mixture of both oils). At the end of 2 weeks, survival rates were compared. Among all types of fat used, the level of fat did not affect outcome, with survival rates of 13% (6 of 45) at the low level of fat used, 30% (13 of 44) at the medium level, and 26% (11 of 43) at the high level (P greater than 0.10). However fat composition significantly influenced survival across all levels of fat, with a 39% (17 of 44) survival rate in the groups given equal amounts of Microlipid and MaxEPA, compared either to 21% (9 of 44) for the 100% Microlipid groups, or to 9% (4 of 44) for the 100% MaxEPA groups (p less than 0.05). A second experiment was performed with 58 animals fed five different mixtures of fats, all at 14% of total calories. Diets were made with fat ratios of 100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, and 0:100 Microlipid to MaxEPA. The survival rate in the 50:50 group was 83% (10 of 12), which is significantly higher than the survival rates with any of the others (p less than 0.05). It is concluded that the amount of fat in the diet does not strongly influence outcome in this model. However an equal mixture of safflower and fish oils significantly improves survival rates compared to diets made with single-oil preparations. 
An evaluation of clinical variables in determining the need for pelvic examination in the emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of multiple clinical variables to predict an increased or decreased probability of pelvic pathology, therefore determining when a pelvic examination is needed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: An urban emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: 246 female patients presenting with abdominal pain and undergoing pelvic examination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 99 patients without pelvic pathology (40%) and group 2 consisted of 147 patients with pelvic pathology (60%). Pelvic pathology was defined as presence of infective discharge (with confirmation on wet mount/potassium hydroxide smear), presence of adnexal mass and/or tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, uterine enlargement and/or tenderness, blood in the vaginal vault, and culture report positive for Neisseria gonorrhea. The following variables achieved statistical significance (P less than .05) using a logistic regression model: history of vaginal discharge (odds ratio, 2.30 [95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 4.32]); history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia (4.35 [1.52 to 12.40]); right upper quadrant pain on physical examination (0.33 [0.13 to 0.85]); and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination or history (1.73 [0.94 to 3.19]). CONCLUSION: History of vaginal discharge, history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia, and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination act as risk variables predicting presence of pelvic disease. Right upper quadrant pain on physical examination acts as a protective variable to predict absence of pelvic disease. This information may aid the emergency physician in determining the need for a pelvic examination in women with abdominal pain. 
Preliminary report: activation of the cerebellum in essential tremor [published erratum appears in Lancet 1990 Nov 24;336(8726):1330] Several images of cerebral blood flow were recorded during inhalation of carbon-15-labelled carbon dioxide by positron emission tomography in four patients with essential tremor and four normal controls. Unilateral involuntary postural tremor in essential tremor patients was associated with blood flow significantly greater than that at rest in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, both lateral premotor regions, and both cerebellar hemispheres. Of these regions, only the cerebellum was not activated in normal controls holding a posture without tremor or in essential tremor patients undergoing passive wrist movement. The increased flow in the cerebellum therefore seems to represent neural activity involved in tremor generation. It is proposed that essential tremor is due to oscillation within cerebello-olivary pathways, relayed by way of the thalamus and motor cortex to the spinal cord. 
Enteroscopic diagnosis of small bowel ulceration in patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and who had chronic occult gastrointestinal bleeding underwent extended small bowel examination with a Sonde enteroscope. 7 patients (47%) were found to have jejunal or ileal ulceration. Small bowel enteroscopy may be a valuable technique for the investigation of undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding. 
Therapeutic administration of fibronectin: current uses and potential applications. Fibronectins are a class of multifunctional glycoproteins that exist in soluble and insoluble forms. These glycoproteins are found in nearly all body fluids and in tissue extracellular matrices. Alterations in the normal synthesis, release, and distribution of fibronectins are characteristic features of certain human pathophysiologic conditions. The therapeutic administration of plasma fibronectin to human patients with defects in corneal wound healing and critically ill adult patients with multisystem organ failure appears clinically beneficial, although confirmation is needed from additional trials in progress. In vitro data suggest a role for fibronectin in enhancing (directly and indirectly) the function of phagocytes isolated from the blood of newborn infants. Although as yet untested, it is possible that fibronectin administration to the immunologically immature human neonate may improve host defenses and reduce the risk of nosocomial infection. Additional research is needed to define the factors that regulate the synthesis, isoform expression, and clearance of endogenous fibronectins during normal fetal and neonatal development. Continued research to define the role of endogenous fibronectins in augmenting the inflammatory response of the neonatal host is also required before rational immunotherapeutic interventions can be initiated. 
Organ doses received by atomic bomb survivors during radiological examinations at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation. When evaluating the risks of oncogenesis and cancer mortality following exposure to the radiations of the atomic bombs (A-bombs), the medical X-ray doses received by the A-bomb survivors must also be estimated and considered. Using a human phantom, dosimetry was performed to estimate the X-ray doses received by A-bomb survivors during medical examinations at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) as part of the long-term follow-up on the Adult Health Study (AHS). These examinations have been estimated to represent nearly 45% of the survivors' cumulative medical irradiation dose. Doses to the salivary glands, thyroid gland, lung, breast, stomach and colon were measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters. The results, which are reported here, will aid in estimating organ doses received by individual AHS participants. 
Platelet dysfunction in Noonan's syndrome. A case with a platelet cyclooxygenase-like deficiency and chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. Individuals with Noonan's syndrome are likely to have one or more coagulation abnormalities: complex platelet function defects, partial Factor XI deficiency, or von Willebrand's disease. A distinctive platelet function defect has not been identified. The authors describe a 24-year-old women with Noonan's syndrome, chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), and a platelet function defect characterized by a greater than 15-minute bleeding time, failure of aggregation and release with 10 microM ADP, 10 microM epinephrine, 750 microM arachidonic acid or 0.019 g/L collagen. A mixture of aspirin-treated platelets with the patient's platelets failed to correct the defect. Addition of 2.5 microM U46619 (a PGG2 analogue) corrected the aggregation and release defect. An electron microscopic analysis failed to reveal structural abnormalities. Thus, the platelet function defect in this patient appears to be a functional deficiency of cyclooxygenase. The presence of autoantiplatelet antibodies in a clinical setting consistent with chronic ITP raises the possibility that the defect may be acquired. 
Autosomal dominant deletions of the mitochondrial genome in a case of progressive encephalomyopathy. Multiple deletions of the mitochondrial genome were found in a family in which the proband had ataxia and ketoacidotic comas. A progressive multiorgan involvement appeared in the course of the disease, and histopathological investigation demonstrated mitochondrial myopathy features with ragged red fibers. A defect of oxidative phosphorylation was found in both skeletal muscle and lymphocytes. It is surprising that various mtDNA deletions were detected both in the proband and in his healthy mother and maternal aunt but not in the rest of the maternal progeny. All the deletions were located between Cox II and cytochrome b genes, and short (4-5 bp) repeated sequences were consistently present at the boundaries of the rearrangements in different tissues. Therefore, the deletions appear not to be transmitted per se but to be inherited in a Mendelian manner, being possibly dominant. Both the Mendelian inheritance of the trait and the variety of the deletions in carriers suggest that a nuclearly encoded factor(s) might be involved in the triggering of the deletions. However, the presence of the rearrangements in healthy individuals raises the question of whether mtDNA deletions actually cause the clinical expression of the disease. 
Dehydration syndromes. Oral rehydration and fluid replacement. Dehydration caused by diarrhea remains a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Dehydration is a common clinical presentation seen by most physicians. Clinical diagnosis depends on the recognition of signs and symptoms as well as change in weight. Laboratory studies are helpful in categorizing the dehydration as isotonic, hyponatremic, or hypernatremic, which is necessary to plan appropriate therapy. In many situations, oral rehydration therapy is possible and desirable. Intravenous rehydration remains the standard of care for children with severe dehydration and shock. 
Frequency of inflammatory bowel disease in offspring of couples both presenting with inflammatory bowel disease. A private practice was surveyed for prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in husband-wife partners and in their children. Among approximately 2500 patients with IBD in our files, 19 couples were identified. They were subdivided into group A (n = 5) in which both partners had symptoms of IBD before marriage; group B (n = 7) in which only one spouse had IBD before marriage and the other partner experienced symptoms afterwards; and group C (n = 7) in which neither spouse had symptoms before marriage but IBD subsequently developed in both. In group B, the disease developed in the second spouse 2-16 years after marriage (mean, 6.4 years). In group C, IBD developed in the first spouse 0.3-41 years after marriage and in the second spouse 1-14 years after the first spouse (mean, 6.8 years). Thirty-five children have been born to 16 of the couples. Two children died before age 20. Of the surviving 33 children, IBD has already developed in 12 (36%). Among the other 21 unaffected children, 1 had uveitis at age 9 and 10 are still under the age of 21, perhaps too young to have yet developed IBD. The frequency of IBD in children was slightly higher if both parents had already developed IBD at the time of conception (67%) compared with when only 1 parent (50%) or neither parent (50%) had developed IBD when conception occurred. Although these data do not distinguish genetic from environmental factors, they show a higher risk of IBD in children when both parents have this illness. 
Regional differences in elastic recoil after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty: a quantitative angiographic study. The immediate result of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is influenced by both plastic and elastic changes of the vessel wall. To evaluate the amount of elastic recoil after coronary balloon angioplasty, the minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the largest balloon used at highest inflation pressure was compared with the minimal luminal vessel cross-sectional area directly after final balloon deflation in 607 lesions (526 patients). Elastic recoil was defined as the difference between balloon cross-sectional area and minimal luminal cross-sectional area of the dilated coronary segment immediately after balloon withdrawal. A videodensitometric analysis technique was used to avoid geometric assumptions on stenosis morphology directly after angioplasty. Mean balloon cross-sectional area was 5.3 +/- 1.6 mm2 and minimal luminal cross-sectional area after angioplasty was 2.8 +/- 1.4 mm2. Reference areas before and after angioplasty did not differ (6.0 +/- 2.6 and 6.2 +/- 2.6 mm2, respectively). Univariate analysis revealed that asymmetric lesions, lesions located in less angulated parts of the artery and lesions with a low plaque content showed more elastic recoil. Lesions located in distal parts of the coronary tree were also associated with more elastic recoil probably related to relative balloon oversizing in these distal lesions. 
Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander syndrome: serum creatine kinase and functional outcome. The medical records of 31 patients (19 male and 12 female) with clinical and electrophysiologic features of Wohlfart-Kugelberg-Welander syndrome were reviewed. The reported age at onset ranged from less than one year to 46 years, and the age at diagnosis ranged from three to 66 years. Proximal muscle weakness, especially of the lower extremities, and muscular atrophy were the predominant clinical features. Elevated serum creatine kinase levels were noted in four female and 12 male patients, and the degree of elevation was higher in the male patients (up to 32 times the upper limit of normal) than in the female patients. On initial evaluation, two patients were wheelchair-bound, whereas the others were ambulatory. On follow-up evaluation three to 32 years later (mean, 15.5 years), 11 patients used wheelchairs, although only three were wheelchair-bound. The disease followed a steady, slowly progressive course. The outcome of ambulatory status did not correlate with the initial creatine kinase determination. 
Use of aspiration cytology and frozen section examination for management of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. Between January 1980 and December 1988, 161 patients underwent thyroidectomy with intraoperative frozen section consultation after fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of a thyroid nodule. The FNA were insufficient in 15 instances (9%) and in error in 39 (24%). In 15 cases, the incorrect aspiration diagnosis could have led to excessive surgery and in ten cases to delayed therapy if it had been the only guide for therapy. The diagnosis was deferred to permanent section analysis in 30 (19%) frozen sections. Twenty-two errors (14% of cases) were made in the interpretation of frozen section material, and in an additional 15 patients (9%), the diagnosis suggested (but deferred at frozen section) was in error. In one patient, this error could have led to more extensive surgery than necessary; in 21 patients, the frozen section error could have led to undertreatment. When frozen section results were combined with those of FNA, no therapeutically important false-positive diagnoses were made. In five patients, the combination of both FNA and frozen section results would not have identified a carcinoma which, in three cases, was a small occult papillary carcinoma not found in the index nodule. 
Fc epsilon RI-mediated hydrolysis of phosphoinositides in ghosts derived from rat basophilic leukemia cells. Aggregation of the high affinity receptor for IgE (Fc epsilon RI) on mast cells by a polyvalent Ag leads to hydrolysis of phosphoinositides (PI) catalyzed by phospholipase C (PI-PLC). To understand this phenomenon in molecular terms, it is important to obtain active, cell-free preparations. In extensive preliminary studies, we could not demonstrate Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation of PI-PLC in plasma membranes prepared by conventional methods from rat basophilic leukemia cells. We now report a stepwise approach involving preparation of cytoplasts from such cells and then hypotonic lysis of the cytoplasts to obtain active membrane vesicles. These membranes, best described as "ghosts," appear to reseal after losing greater than 90% of their soluble, cytoplasmic components and contain receptors that when aggregated, activate PI-PLC to hydrolyze endogenous phospholipids. Per unit of plasma membrane, the ghosts retain approximately 25% of Fc epsilon RI-mediated stimulation of PI-PLC relative to the cells. This activity requires ATP, magnesium, phosphoenolpyruvate, and, to a limited degree, calcium. Although an adequate amount of phosphatidylinositol biphosphate is present, the predicted spike of (1,4,5)-inositol trisphosphate is not seen, and the predominant inositol phosphate isomer is (1,4)-inositol bisphosphate. This is the first report of Fc epsilon RI-mediated activation of PI-PLC in a cytoplasm-depleted system that demonstrates activation of endogenous enzyme acting on endogenous substrate. In addition, it is the first such report for any receptor of the Ig superfamily. 
Embolization of cardiac myxomas masquerading as polyarteritis nodosa. Cardiac myxomas are rare tumors which can mimic other diseases. We describe a 19-year-old man who presented clinically with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Muscle biopsy showed vasculitis, but corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy was initially effective. Cardiac myxomas were found by echocardiogram when the disease relapsed and were resected surgically. Segmental arterial aneurysms and stenoses were found on angiography after leg ischemia. We suggest that echocardiography should be performed in all cases of clinically suspected PAN. 
Virchow-Troisier's lymph node in hepatocellular carcinoma. Virchow-Troisier's lymph node is rarely found in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. When present, it may or may not accompany spread of the tumor to mediastinal lymph nodes. In a 20-year-old South African black man with hepatocellular carcinoma, a Virchow-Troisier's node was evident clinically and confirmed at necropsy. Mediastinal lymph nodes were not involved by tumor, and the malignant cells probably gained access to the thoracic duct by way of lymphatic spread to the hepatic lymph nodes in the porta hepatitis and the celiac nodes, both of which were seen at necropsy to be extensively invaded by tumor. 
How much testing is needed after myocardial infarction? Both physicians and patients should be encouraged by the tremendous progress made in the clinical care of patients with heart disease during the last 20 years. However, the number of invasive and noninvasive tests is vast, so they need to be applied judiciously, using a reasonable set of clinical principles to recognize the needs of the individual patient. In the case of myocardial infarction, one of the most important prognostic factors is left ventricular systolic function, which is commonly measured by the ejection fraction. This measurement can be made with a left ventriculogram, radionuclide ventriculogram, or two-dimensional echocardiogram, the choice depending on individual circumstances. 
Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly. Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is a common disorder in the elderly, carrying with it a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Environmental and age-related factors believed to contribute to ISH include obesity, declining physical activity, stress, and such dietary changes as increased salt intake and decreased intake of calcium and potassium. Increased rigidity of the aorta resulting in reduced compliance is an important hemodynamic feature, but factors that increase peripheral resistance also appear to play a role. Antihypertensive drugs have been shown to effectively and safely lower the systolic blood pressure elevations characteristic of ISH. To date, use of low drug doses and careful titration of dosage have avoided significant orthostatic hypotension and undue lowering of the diastolic pressure. Studies of relatively small groups of patients suggest that antihypertensive drugs can lower the risk of cardiovascular morbidity/mortality associated with ISH but the definitive answer awaits results of the ongoing large-scale Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial. In the interim, management should begin with conservative measures such as weight loss, salt restriction and, possibly, calcium supplementation. If this fails, drug therapy should be considered in patients with systolic blood pressures above 180 mm Hg and in those with systolic readings between 160 and 180 mm Hg who have concomitant cardiovascular risk factors. To date, no controlled trials of sufficient size have demonstrated that one drug class is more effective than another in treating ISH. Drug therapy should be tailored to the individual patient, starting with a low dose of a single drug and, if necessary, slowly increasing dosage until a systolic blood pressure under 160 mm Hg is attained. 
Helicobacter pylori: aggressor or innocent bystander? Helicobacter pylori seeks gastric mucosa, whether found in the stomach, duodenum, or Barrett's esophagus. Definitive diagnosis can be secured by appropriate stains of mucosal biopsies and culture, but the rapid urease test, breath isotope studies, and serologic testing are also useful. The frequency of colonization increases with advancing age, but infection occurs earlier in underdeveloped countries. Although the reservoir is uncertain, water or food transmission seems likely. There is sufficient evidence to assign an etiologic role to the bacteria in the causation of type B antral gastritis. H. pylori is found in areas of gastric metaplasia within the duodenum and is associated with duodenitis. Although acute infection leads to hypochlorhydria, chronic colonization has little effect on acid secretion. Studies have thus far failed to establish a convincing relationship between H. pylori and nonulcer dyspepsia, although the bacteria may play a role in selected patients. H. pylori is found in association with most idiopathic gastric and duodenal ulcers, but it is unclear as to whether the bacteria plays a causative or permissive role. The organism has a predilection for intercellular spaces and the mucous layer, thus affording relative isolation from luminally active antibiotics. Monotherapy with bismuth preparations transiently eliminates the bacteria, but recolonization is rapid, probably due to regrowth of sequestered organisms. A combination of metronidazole, bismuth, and tetracycline (or amoxicillin) affords the best eradication rate, but the potential side effects of this program should be considered. The present therapy of duodenal ulcer disease is effective and without significant risk. Treatment of H. pylori should be reserved for those patients who relapse on adequate maintenance therapy. If a safe and effective antibiotic becomes available, more frequent testing and earlier treatment intervention may become more attractive. H. pylori is probably an "innocent bystander" for most patients, but the bacteria may sufficiently impair the defenses of the antral and duodenal mucosa to facilitate the development and relapse of ulcer disease in subsets of patients. 
Retinoblastoma. The long-term appearance of radiated intraocular tumors. A retrospective analysis of 50 patients with retinoblastoma was undertaken to determine the appearance of intraocular retinoblastoma that had received external beam radiation a minimum of 10 years previously. Of the 91 tumors found in 59 eyes, 76 (84%) continued to be ophthalmoscopically visible after 10 years. The most common ophthalmoscopic appearance was a Type III regression pattern. The type of radiation regression pattern correlated with the pretreatment volume of the tumor. The largest tumors (mean, 10.0 disc diameter [dd]) became Type I regression patterns, whereas the smallest tumors (mean, 1.0 dd) completely disappeared. This represents the first long-term follow-up of the intraocular status of radiated retinoblastoma. 
L-type cardiac calcium channels in doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in rats morphological, biochemical, and functional correlations. Doxorubicin (DXR) is an effective antitumor agent in a wide spectrum of neoplasms. Chronic treatment is associated with cardiomyopathy and characteristic myocardial ultrastructural changes, which include swelling of the t tubules. Accordingly, we investigated excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyopathic rat heart resulting from chronic DXR treatment. Using the whole-cell patch clamp technique, we studied the L-type calcium channel in single cells enzymatically isolated from normal (CTRL) and DXR rat hearts. Despite similar cell dimensions, the total membrane capacitance was significantly smaller in the DXR cells (138 +/- 9 pF) than in the CTRL cells (169 +/- 11 pF) (mean +/- SEM, n = 9, P less than 0.05). The mean current and the current density-voltage relationships of the CTRL and the DXR cells were significantly different (n = 9, P less than 0.001) with the maximal peak L-type calcium current (ICa) density increased from 6.4 +/- 0.9 in CTRL cells to 10.5 +/- 2.4 microA/cm2 in the DXR cells (P less than 0.05). There was no shift either in the current-voltage relationship or the steady-state inactivation curve in the two cell groups. However, the fast time constant of inactivation was increased at a membrane voltage of -10 to 10 mV. Calcium channel antagonist equilibrium binding assays using [3H]-PN200-110 revealed no difference in the maximal receptor binding capacity (CTRL, 194 +/- 27 and DXR 211 +/- 24 fmol/mg protein; P greater than 0.05, n = 6) and in receptor affinity (CTRL, 0.15 +/- 0.05 and DXR 0.13 +/- 0.03 nM; P less than 0.05). These data suggest that a decrease in effective capacitance might be associated with t-tubular damage. Despite this decrease, ICa was increased in the DXR cells. Such an increase may result from an alteration in the properties of the calcium channels and/or recruitment of "hibernating" channels in the remaining surface and t-tubular membranes. 
Hypersomnia in bipolar depression: a comparison with narcolepsy using the multiple sleep latency test. OBJECTIVE: This study characterized objectively the hypersomnia frequently seen in the depressed phase of bipolar affective disorder. On the basis of previous work in sleep and affective disorders, it has been hypothesized that the hypersomnia is related to greater REM sleep. This hypothesis was tested by using a multiple sleep latency test to compare bipolar affective disorder with narcolepsy, a well-defined primary sleep disorder associated with known REM sleep dysfunction. METHOD: Twenty-five bipolar depressed patients were selected on the basis of complaints of hypersomnia. They underwent 2 nights of polysomnography followed by a multiple sleep latency test. Data on their nocturnal sleep and daytime naps were compared with similar data on 23 nondepressed narcoleptic patients referred for sleep evaluation. RESULTS: Despite their complaints of hypersomnia, no abnormalities were noted for the bipolar group in the results from the multiple sleep latency test. Contrary to the working hypothesis, REM sleep was notably absent during daytime naps in the depressed patients, in marked contrast to the findings for the narcoleptic group. CONCLUSIONS: The complaint of sleepiness in the hypersomnic bipolar depressed patient appears to be related to the lack of interest, withdrawal, decreased energy, or psychomotor retardation inherent in the anergic depressed condition, rather than an increase in true sleep propensity or REM sleep propensity. 
Mitochondrial dysfunction in multiple symmetrical lipomatosis. Multiple symmetrical lipomatosis is a striking clinical finding associated with a variety of peripheral and central nervous system abnormalities. We describe 4 unrelated patients with evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle. Multiple symmetrical lipomatosis is an additional, albeit unusual, manifestation of the expanding clinical spectrum of mitochondrial diseases. 
Overzealous resuscitation of an extremely malnourished patient with nutritional cardiomyopathy. Overzealous resuscitation of the severely malnourished patient may be associated with life-threatening complications. A variety of electrolyte, hemodynamic, septic, and nutritional derangements may result in sudden decompensation and even death. We present a case that dramatically illustrates these complications and focuses on the key role of underlying nutritional cardiomyopathy. 
The risk of ligation of the left renal vein in resection of the abdominal aortic aneurysm. The left renal vein can be ligated during aortic operation to attain better access to the perirenal aorta. This maneuver has been considered safe, with a low incidence of postoperative renal complications. This study was done to evaluate the risk of left renal vein ligation and its influence on renal function in patients with elective resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The records of 332 patients undergoing elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms during a five year period were reviewed. The clinical and operative data of patients who had left renal vein ligation and those who did not were similar. Left renal vein ligation was not associated with an increased mortality rate but was strongly associated with an increase in serum creatinine level and a clinical diagnosis of postoperative azotemia. Nine of 13 patients who had left renal vein ligation had postoperative azotemia compared with 21 of 319 patients without left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.001). The mean change of preoperative and postoperative creatinine value was an increase of 1.92 milligrams per deciliter in patients with left renal vein ligation in contrast with 0.26 milligram per deciliter in patients without ligation (p less than 0.00075). Thus, ligation of the left renal vein increases the risk of postoperative renal complications and its use should be selective. 
Role of quinsy tonsillectomy in the management of peritonsillar abscess. Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is the most frequent complication of acute tonsillitis requiring surgical intervention. Debate continues concerning optimal therapy in terms of patient morbidity and cost-effectiveness. A retrospective study was performed on 45 tonsillectomies for PTA in military personnel from December 1986 through December 1988. Twenty-three quinsy (abscess) tonsillectomies and 22 interval tonsillectomies were identified. Parameters studied were age, sex, abscess location, interval prior to operation, blood loss, operative time, operative experience, and combined hospital and convalescent days for the two groups. Significant differences were noted between the quinsy and interval tonsillectomy groups concerning the average number of days hospitalized (3.0 versus 4.5) and their respective convalescent periods (10.3 versus 17.3). We conclude that quinsy tonsillectomy is the best management for PTA in a young work force when the optimal treatment choice is between interval or acute tonsillectomy. 
Preventing death after traumatic rupture of the aorta. A chest film may help save a life. Traumatic rupture of the aorta is a life-threatening injury that necessitates immediate diagnosis and surgical repair. Diagnosis depends on recognition of findings on a plain chest film, specifically, mediastinal widening, left hemothorax, and an apical cap sign. Aortography should be done immediately to establish the diagnosis when clinical and/or radiographic findings suggest a rupture. 
Pediatric emergency transport and the private practitioner. A mail survey of 182 pediatricians and 92 family practitioners in Pennsylvania was conducted to determine their methods of transport of seriously ill children from their offices to referral centers and their involvement with professional transport services. Although most physicians (93.1%) stated that they had professional services available to them (at their office location), more than half (53.8%) indicated that the patient's family automobile was their most commonly used method of transport of ill children to tertiary care centers. This was true regardless of the disease entity involved, including suspected epiglottitis. Practice setting had little influence on transport method. However, in general, younger children were judged to need ambulance transport more often than older children. Reasons cited for not using professional transport from the office included a perceived better efficiency of the family car (61.8%), the prohibitively high expense of professional transport (9.8%), and failure to consider professional transport (6.5%). Further study of this component of office preparedness is suggested. 
Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome in a female with a balanced X;20 translocation: mapping of the X chromosome breakpoint. A Hispanic girl with Lowe oculocerebrorenal syndrome (OCRL), an X-linked recessive condition characterized by cataracts, glaucoma, mental retardation, and proteinuria, is reported. A balanced X;20 chromosomal translocation with the X chromosome breakpoint at q26.1 was found with high-resolution trypsin-Giemsa banding. Somatic cell hybridization was used to separate the X chromosome derivative and the chromosome 20 derivative in order to position, with respect to the translocation breakpoint, several DNA loci that are linked to the Lowe syndrome locus (Xq24-q26). DXS10 and DXS53 were found to be distal to the breakpoint, whereas DXS37 and DXS42 were located proximal to it. These studies suggest that the OCRL locus lies in the region between these probes. The translocation chromosome originated from an unaffected male without a visible translocation, indicating that the most likely cause of OCRL in this patient is the de novo translocation that disrupted the OCRL locus. 
Long-term clinical follow-up of adult idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and celiac disease. A 22-year-old man with a history of repeated whole blood transfusions since the age of 7, was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea and blood-stained sputum. A complete blood cell count, a test for reticulin antibodies, an x-ray film of the chest, a transbronchial biopsy and a biopsy of the small bowel were performed and the results confirmed the diagnosis of IPH, associated with CD. The patient has been asymptomatic for four years on a gluten-free diet. In cases of IPH, it may be important to investigate the coexistence of CD because treatment of the latter could lead to a better prognosis. 
Hemifacial spasm in an infant due to fourth ventricular ganglioglioma. Case report. The case of an infant is reported in which hemifacial spasm due to a ganglioglioma of the fourth ventricle was relieved by surgery. Previously described causes of hemifacial spasm are summarized, and the relevance of this case to theories on the pathogenesis of the condition is discussed. 
Surgical strategies in the treatment of pancreatic necrosis and infection. Controversy still surrounds the management of necrotic and septic complications of acute pancreatitis. A review of the literature of the past decade dealing with the surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis, pancreatic abscess and infected pancreatic necrosis has been undertaken. Three main patterns of management could be identified: (1) 'conventional treatment', consisting of pancreatic resection or necrosectomy with drainage; (2) 'local lavage', consisting of necrosectomy followed by regional lavage; and (3) 'open management', with resection or necrosectomy followed by planned multiple re-explorations. From this review it appears that local lavage and open management offer better survival prospects than conventional treatment. Open abdomen techniques, however, are associated with an increased risk of complications, such as colonic necrosis, intestinal fistula, and intra-abdominal bleeding. Excellent results can be achieved in specialized centres with any of the three methods, provided adequate debridement and prompt reoperations are undertaken if the septic state persists. 
Characterization of Bay U 3405, a novel thromboxane A2/endoperoxide receptor antagonist. The thromboxane A2-receptor antagonistic properties of Bay U 3405 [(3R)-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-carbaz o-lepropanoic acid] have been evaluated in various pharmacologic models. Bay U 3405 specifically inhibits platelet aggregation induced by U 46619, collagen, platelet-activating factor, and the second wave of ADP (IC50 0.5, 0.07, 0.3, 0.19 microM) in human plasma. The plasma phase of ADP-induced aggregation is not affected. U 46619-induced platelet aggregation is competitively antagonized (pA2 = 6.3). In humans, ex vivo platelet aggregation is inhibited after oral application of 2 or 50 mg Bay U 3405. Bay U 3405 also specifically and competitively antagonizes U 46619-induced contractions of rabbit aortic rings (pA2 = 7.4). In vivo, Bay U 3405 protects rabbits dose dependently from arachidonic acid or collagen-induced thromboembolism (ED50 1-3 mg/kg p.o). Chronic administration of Bay U 3405 to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats reduces stroke-related mortality and diminishes the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhages. From these results, we conclude that Bay U 3405 is an orally active, selective, and competitive thromboxane A2-receptor antagonist that may be beneficial in the treatment of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. 
Prednisone inhibits the appearance of inflammatory mediators and the influx of eosinophils and basophils associated with the cutaneous late-phase response to allergen. To better define the effect of systemic glucocorticoids on the cutaneous early and late phase response (LPR), nine atopic subjects were examined in a double-blind cross-over study using skin chambers fixed over denuded skin blisters. A challenge was carried out by placing allergen in the chamber for 60 min in subjects who received either a 3-day pretreatment with 60 mg/day of prednisone or placebo. Skin chamber cell counts and inflammatory mediators (histamine, PGD2, and leukotriene C4 (LTC4)) were measured at hourly intervals for 12 h. Prednisone pretreatment did not alter the immediate skin erythema or release of histamine but ablated the late secondary erythema and rise in histamine. The median histamine values during h 10, 11, and 12 in the placebo and prednisone pretreatment visits were 3.73 and 0.22 ng/ml, respectively (p less than or equal to 0.02). Prednisone did not alter PGD2 production; however, LTC4 production was suppressed during the LPR. The cumulative median LTC4 values during h 7, 8, and 9 were 5.6-fold (p less than or equal to 0.05) more after placebo than after prednisone pretreatment. Prednisone altered cellular traffic more dramatically than it did inflammatory mediators. The influx of eosinophils, which peaked during the 9th and 10th h in placebo-treated patients, was completely blocked by prednisone (p less than or equal to 0.02) for every h from 6 through 12. The influx of basophils, which started during the 9th h and peaked during the 12th h in placebo-treated patients, was suppressed at all time points (p less than or equal to 0.02) in prednisone-treated patients. There was no significant alteration in neutrophil transit into the skin chambers induced by prednisone. We suggest that the selective blockade of eosinophil and basophil influx by prednisone and the associated decrease in inflammatory mediators may contribute to the blockade of the clinical expression of the cutaneous LPR. 
Separate sex-influenced and genetic components in spontaneously hypertensive rat hypertension. Previous results from our laboratory indicated two major genetic components of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) hypertension, an autosomal component and a Y chromosome component. Two new substrains, SHR/a and SHR/y, were developed using a series of backcrosses to isolate each of these components. The SHR/a substrain has the autosomal loci and X chromosome from the SHR strain and the Y chromosome from the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat strain. The SHR/y substrain has only the Y chromosome from the SHR and autosomal loci and X chromosome from the WKY strain. Throughout these breeding programs parents were chosen at random without selection for blood pressure. Males of both substrains maintained blood pressures over 180 mm Hg. Comparisons of blood pressure in these new substrains with the original parental strains can be used to determine the relative proportions of each genetic component in hypertension. The Y chromosome component contributes 34 mm Hg, which is the difference between SHR/y male and WKY male blood pressure. The total autosomal component contributes 46 mm Hg, which is the difference between SHR/a male and WKY male blood pressure. The autosomal component is a sex-influenced trait; males in the SHR/a strain have significantly higher pressures than SHR/a females. Of the 46 mm Hg estimated for the autosomal component, 41 mm Hg is the result of these loci interacting with male phenotypic sex. This sex-influenced component is separate and distinct from the Y chromosome component. 
Progressive loss of speech output and orofacial dyspraxia associated with frontal lobe hypometabolism. Three patients are described with slowly progressive loss of speech and dysarthria associated with orofacial dyspraxia, initially with intact written language, who subsequently developed more widespread cognitive abnormalities. Positron emission tomography (PET) revealed bifrontal hypometabolism in all of the patients, most marked in the inferior and lateral portions of both frontal lobes, with some extension into the parietal and temporal cortices in one case. These patients may represent a further example of focal progressive cortical degeneration. 
Hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy in the limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis. A patient with the limited form of Wegener's granulomatosis is reported. The case is unusual because of hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy, severe ulceration of the respiratory and digestive tracts, and the rapidly fatal outcome. 
Elective total hip arthroplasty in patients older than 80 years of age. Elective total hip arthroplasties (THA) were performed in 91 patients (101 hips) older than 80 years of age at operation. A control group of 87 patients (102 hips) aged 64 to 67 years who had elective THA was chosen statistically to represent the average THA patient. There were 51 minor and eight major perioperative complications in the elderly group and 26 minor and two major complications in the control group. The only in-hospital death was in the control group. The mean hospital stay was two days longer in the elderly group. Five years postoperatively, 83% of the patients in both groups were ambulating without pain. The mean hip score improved from 49 to 84 points in the elderly group and from 52 to 88 points in the control group. These functional results justify elective THA in patients older than 80 years of age. 
Proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death in young patients receiving encainide and flecainide. The Pediatric Electrophysiology Group The potential for proarrhythmic responses to the class IC sodium channel-blocking drugs encainide and flecainide has not been well described in young patients. Therefore, data were retrospectively collected from 36 institutions regarding 579 young patients who were administered encainide or flecainide for treatment of supraventricular tachycardias (encainide 86 patients, flecainide 369 patients) or ventricular arrhythmias (encainide 21 patients, flecainide 103 patients) to assess the frequency of proarrhythmia, cardiac arrest and death during therapy (adverse events). The two drugs were similar in regard to efficacy (flecainide 71.4%, encainide 59.8%) and rate of proarrhythmic responses (flecainide 7.4%; encainide 7.5%). However, patients receiving encainide more frequently experienced cardiac arrest (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.3%, p less than 0.05) or died during treatment (encainide 7.5% vs. flecainide 2.1%, p less than 0.05). Detailed data were provided for 44 patients experiencing one or more adverse events. Patient age, previous drug trials, concomitant therapy and days of inpatient monitoring were similar for patients receiving encainide or flecainide. However, echocardiographic left ventricular shortening before treatment was lower among patients receiving encainide (0.23 +/- 0.09) than among those receiving flecainide (0.34 +/- 0.06, p less than 0.05). Plasma drug concentrations were rarely elevated. Cardiac arrest (12 patients) and deaths (13 patients) occurred predominantly among patients with underlying heart disease, particularly among patients receiving flecainide for supraventricular tachycardia (8.3% vs. 0.3%, p less than 0.001). Fifteen patients with an ostensibly normal heart and normal ventricular function experienced proarrhythmia during treatment for supraventricular tachycardia, but only 3 of the 15 had a cardiac arrest or died. The relatively high incidence of adverse events should be considered when contemplating treatment with encainide or flecainide, particularly among patients with underlying heart disease. 
Genetics of colon cancer. Strikingly rapid advances in the identification of genetic events that are important in colonic carcinogenesis have been made in the past several years. Specific inherited (adenomatous polyposis coli gene) and acquired (ras gene point mutations; c-myc gene amplification; allelic deletion at specific sites on chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) genetic abnormalities appear to be capable of mediating steps in the progression from normal to malignant colonic mucosa. Understanding these genetic factors and how they influence cellular function will have a profound effect on medical practice. High-risk populations will be (and are being) identified by genetic markers, thus allowing prevention and screening to be more precisely targeted to the population at risk; intervention strategies will be designed on the basis of the known cellular defects of neoplastic colonic mucosa; and new molecular preventive and therapeutic approaches can be developed. 
Fractures of the dens complicating ankylosing spondylitis with atlantooccipital fusion. Patients with ankylosing spondylitis are prone to fractures. Fractures tend to occur in the lower cervical spine disc space. We describe 2 patients with odontoid fractures. Both patients had atlantooccipital fusion which may have increased their susceptibility for dens fractures. One patient had Crohn's disease. 
Cytokine influence on killing of fresh chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by human leukocytes. The feasibility of combining the Lym-1 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) was evaluated. We used an in vitro tumor lysis model that incorporated fresh CLL cells from 21 different patients as targets for two distinct normal human leukocyte effector subsets, neutrophils, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Lym-1 antigen (Lym-1-Ag) expression varied greatly and did not correlate with the expression of other CLL-associated antigens such as CD5, CD19, or HLA-DR. CLL cells were not lysed by neutrophils alone or with IFN-gamma in the absence of Lym-1. Neutrophil Lym-1-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the absence of IFN-gamma was weak and inconsistent. IFN-gamma exposure induced MoAb-dependent lysis of 80% of 21 CLL targets and resulted in an eightfold augmentation of neutrophil ADCC against the remainder. Cytotoxicity correlated directly and positively with Lym-1-Ag expression. Confirmation of the need for interaction between neutrophil IgG Fc receptors (Fc gamma Rs) and the Fc portion of the Lym-1 MoAb was obtained by demonstrating that purified Staphylococcus aureus Protein A (SpA) inhibited ADCC. IFN-gamma exposure caused no consistent alternations in Lym-1-Ag expression on CLL cells so that target antigen upregulation was unlikely to account for augmentation of neutrophil ADCC. PBMCs alone, exposed to interkeukin-2 (IL-2) or IFN-gamma, or with Lym-1 in the presence or absence of IL-2 or IFN-gamma were unable to lyse CLL targets. PBMCs were able to kill Raji Burkitt lymphoma cells in conjunction with Lym-1, so their ability to interact with Lym-1-coated targets and their lytic functions appeared intact. These results emphasize the importance of examining fresh tumor cells with different leukocyte effector subsets before designing a clinical trial that combines a therapeutic MoAb with a cytokine. 
Esophagogastric neoplasms: palliation with a modified gianturco stent. Self-expanding metallic stents of a modified Gianturco design were used for palliative treatment of malignant esophagogastric strictures. Over a 10-month period, 10 stents were placed in nine patients. All patients with severe dysphagia due to malignant strictures in whom all other treatment options had failed were candidates for these stents. Neither extensive length of esophageal involvement nor complete esophageal obstruction was a contraindication. All stents were placed with fluoroscopic guidance without any technical failures or procedural morbidity or mortality. Mild reflux occurred in three patients in whom the stent tubes straddled the distal esophageal sphincter. Five patients were still alive after 1-8 months. The remaining four patients died 6-28 weeks after stent placement; all stents were patent at the time of death. These stents are easy to insert, safe, and reasonably effective for short-term palliative treatment of esophagogastric neoplasms. 
Transforming growth factor beta 1 is present at sites of extracellular matrix gene expression in human pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is an inexorably fatal disorder characterized by connective tissue deposition within the terminal air spaces resulting in loss of lung function and eventual respiratory failure. Previously, we demonstrated that foci of activated fibroblasts expressing high levels of fibronectin, procollagen, and smooth muscle actin and thus resembling those found in healing wounds are responsible for the connective tissue deposition and scarring in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we now demonstrate the presence of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), a potent profibrotic cytokine, in the foci containing these activated fibroblasts. These results suggest that matrix-associated TGF-beta 1 may serve as a stimulus for the persistent expression of connective tissue genes. One potential source of the TGF-beta 1 is the alveolar macrophage, and we demonstrate the expression of abundant TGF-beta 1 mRNA in alveolar macrophages in lung tissue from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 
Vasopressin-dependent kidney hypertrophy: role of urinary concentration in protein-induced hypertrophy and in the progression of chronic renal failure. Recent experiments have shown that the kidney adapts to chronic variations in urine concentration. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), kidney weight relative to body weight, thickness of inner stripe of the outer medulla, volume of epithelium in early thick ascending limb, and internephron heterogeneity are all decreased by chronic water diuresis and increased by chronic stimulation of urine concentration. It was further shown that the intrarenal pattern of hypertrophy observed after high protein (HP) intake, but not that observed after compensatory hypertrophy or normal growth with age, is exactly similar to that observed after chronic stimulation of urine concentration. Since solute-free water reabsorption (TcH2O) is markedly enhanced by HP diet, this suggests that the increases in GFR and renal mass observed after HP intake are, at least in part, an adaptive response of the kidney to increased urinary concentrating activity. The beneficial effects are induced by protein restriction in chronic renal failure (CRF) could thus be due, in part, to the reduction of this concentrating activity. This hypothesis was confirmed by an experiment performed in rats with experimental chronic renal failure (CRF) in which a chronic increase in water intake, reducing urine osmolality and TcH2O, without any change in food composition or consumption, reduced proteinuria, systemic hypertension, kidney hypertrophy, incidence of glomerulosclerosis, and mortality. 
Inefficacy and proarrhythmic effects of flecainide and encainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of encainide and flecainide in treating patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias. DESIGN: Patients were treated with encainide or flecainide. Efficacy was assessed by comparing the results of programmed ventricular stimulation while patients received therapy with the results while they were drug free. SETTING: The electrophysiology laboratory of the University of California at San Francisco. PATIENTS: Forty-nine patients with spontaneous or inducible sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation for whom treatment with at least one class IA antiarrhythmic agent had failed. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were treated with encainide, 35 to 50 mg three or four times daily, or flecainide, 100 to 200 mg twice daily. RESULTS: Arrhythmia worsened early in 5 of 16 patients receiving encainide and 3 of 33 patients receiving flecainide. Patients with poor left ventricular function were more likely to exhibit proarrhythmia (P = 0.02). Nine of eleven patients receiving encainide and 23 of 28 patients receiving flecainide who had repeat programmed ventricular stimulation while receiving drug therapy still had inducible, poorly tolerated ventricular tachycardia. CONCLUSION: Encainide and flecainide have a low efficacy rate and a high incidence of worsening of arrhythmia in patients with sustained ventricular arrhythmias, particularly when this condition is associated with poor left ventricular function. 
Stressful life events and symptom onset in HIV infection. OBJECTIVE: The authors' goal is to provide basic epidemiologic data on the issue of reactivity to stress and HIV symptom onset by studying the relationship between a broad set of naturally occurring stressor events and HIV natural history in a large longitudinal community sample of HIV-seropositive homosexual men. METHOD: Subjects were recruited from a cohort of 1,011 homosexual men enrolled in the Chicago site of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study who also participated in the Coping and Change Study. The men were given self-administered questionnaires assessing behavioral, psychological, and psychosocial variables. Relationships between reports of stressful life events and longitudinal biomedical data measuring illness progression were examined. Life events were assessed by reports on the numbers of lovers, friends, and acquaintances who were diagnosed with AIDS or had died of AIDS and by scores on a checklist of 24 more general serious stressor events. The variables indicating progression of illness among initially asymptomatic men were a drop in T-helper lymphocyte percent (CD4%) between pairs of examinations of at least 25% and onset between examinations of thrush and/or fever lasting a minimum of 2 weeks. RESULTS: The authors found no evidence that serious stressor events have any meaningful effect on symptom onset indicated by either a drop in CD4% or onset of fever or thrush. CONCLUSIONS: There is no need for asymptomatic people with HIV infection to restrict their lives in order to avoid exposure to stressful life experiences or to develop special skills for coping with stress to forestall the progression of HIV illness. 
PAF-induced bowel necrosis. Effects of vasodilators. Ischemic bowel necrosis in the rat is produced by injecting platelet-activating factor (PAF) intravenously. Since intestinal hypoperfusion is observed after PAF injection, we hypothesize that mesenteric vasoconstriction is the mechanism of bowel injury. We thus studied the effects of vasodilators in this model. We found that: (1) Phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615 (leukotriene antagonist) and PGE1 counteracted the PAF-induced mesenteric flow reduction and ameliorated the bowel injury. However, phenoxybenzamine and prazosin were relatively ineffective in correcting PAF-induced hypotension, showing that bowel injury can be prevented independently of the hypotensive state. (2) Nitroglycerin failed to prevent bowel injury, although it improved the mesenteric blood flow. Thus, in opposition to our initial hypothesis, correction of the mesenteric flow reduction induced by PAF does not always prevent intestineal necrosis. (3) Only phenoxybenzamine, prazosin, ICI 198615, and PGE1 ameliorated PAF-induced hemoconcentration and bowel injury. This suggests a correlation between vascular injury (expressed by "leaky" vessels and the consequent hemoconcentration) and bowel necrosis. (4) Although both nitroglycerin and hydralazine relax smooth muscle, hydralazine seemed to aggravate bowel necrosis. The mechanism remains unclear. 
Familial aggregation and severity of epilepsy. Genetic models for complex diseases frequently assume that genetic factors play a greater role in severe forms than in mild forms of disease. This study examined familial aggregation of epilepsy in relation to two measures of severity: duration and remission. The study population comprised 358 offspring born in Rochester, MN, U.S.A., to parents with epilepsy who were diagnosed in Rochester between 1935 and 1979 and followed for greater than or equal to 5 years after the first seizure. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to examine the effects of duration of the parent's epilepsy (less than 5 vs. greater than or equal to 5 years) and remission of the parent's epilepsy (greater than or equal to 5 years seizure-free) on risk of unprovoked seizures in offspring. The univariate rate ratio (RR) for parent's duration (long vs. short) was 1.1 (95% confidence interval 0.32-3.57). The RR for parent's remission was 2.5 (0.55-11.41), reflecting a higher risk for offspring of remitting parents, which was not statistically significant. Multivariate analysis was used to control for three other parental attributes associated with offspring seizure risk: sex, age at onset of seizures (less than 20 vs. greater than or equal to 20 years), and seizure type (absence vs. other). The RR for duration was not substantially changed in this analysis (1.2; 0.37-4.16). However, the RR for remission dropped to 1.2 (0.25-5.97), suggesting that the higher risk in offspring of remitting parents was largely explained by confounding with other factors that influence offspring seizure risk.
