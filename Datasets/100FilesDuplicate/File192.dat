Incentive spirometry versus routine chest physiotherapy for prevention of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery We entered 876 patients into a clinical trial aimed at preventing pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery. Patients either received conventional chest physiotherapy or were encouraged to perform maximal inspiratory manoeuvres for 5 min during each hour while awake, using an incentive spirometer. The incidence of pulmonary complications did not differ significantly between the groups: incentive spirometry 68 of 431 (15.8%, 95% CI 14.0-17.6%), and chest physiotherapy 68 of 445 (15.3%, CI 13.6-17.0%). Nor was there a difference between the groups in the incidence of positive clinical signs, pyrexia, abnormal chest radiographs, pathogens in sputum, respiratory failure (PO2 less than 60 mm Hg), or length of stay in hospital. We conclude that prophylactic incentive spirometry and chest physiotherapy are of equivalent clinical efficacy in the general management of patients undergoing abdominal surgery. 
Gastric emptying in patients with severe reflux esophagitis. The pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is not fully understood. There have been reports that delayed gastric emptying is a contributing factor in some patients. To determine whether delayed gastric emptying plays a role in the genesis of GER, we correlated gastric-emptying measures obtained by scintigraphic techniques with the degree of acid reflux assessed by esophageal pH monitoring. Ten patients, all of whom had evidence of esophageal mucosal disease and severe acid reflux, were studied. Four of the 10 patients with reflux had prolongation in the lag phase of gastric solid emptying, and one of the four showed prolonged gastric-emptying t1/2. There was no significant difference, however, in the mean gastric-emptying t1/2 between a control group and the patient group. Furthermore, there was no correlation between gastric-emptying measures and degree of acid reflux. We conclude that in this group of 10 patients with severe GER, delayed gastric emptying does not play an important role in the development of gastroesophageal reflux. 
Recurrence of oropharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. Two-hundred-and-twenty-one patients with squamous carcinoma of the oropharynx treated by irradiation are presented. The primary recurrence rate at five years in the previously untreated patients was 27%, but was dictated by neither host factors (age, sex and general condition) nor tumour factors (site, T-stage and histological grade). Pre-operative histological diagnosis had a very high sensitivity but a low specificity, indicating that false positives are common but false negatives unusual. Twenty per cent of patients with a recurrent primary tumour were untreatable. The five year survival after a primary recurrence was 31 per cent. Sixty-eight per cent of patients undergoing major surgery recovered without a major complication, and the hospital mortality rate was three per cent, due entirely to major medical catastrophes. The major complication rate in those undergoing flap repair after major resection was seven per cent. The metastatic rate in lymph nodes was 44 per cent at five years, and again this did not depend on any host or tumour factors. The survival at five years after node recurrence was a mere 19 per cent, and the length of survival was related to the primary site of the original tumour and the presence of extranodal disease. Two-thirds of patients had advanced disease (N2 and N3) when node recurrence was diagnosed and about 15 per cent were unsuitable for surgery. 
Cerebral infarction verified by cranial computed tomography and prognosis for survival following transient ischemic attack. Of 564 consecutive patients with transient ischemic attack, 350 (62%) had cranial computed tomography performed. Except for date of admission and smoking history, there were few differences between the patients evaluated with computed tomography and the 214 who were not. Cerebral infarcts were found in 59 (17%) of the 350 tomographic evaluations. Previous clinically diagnosed stroke, older age, and male sex were all significantly associated with the occurrence of tomographically verified infarcts (p less than 0.05). After controlling for stroke history and other important covariates, patients with tomographically verified infarcts had significantly shorter survival times than did patients without evidence of infarction on computed tomography (p = 0.035). Thus, cranial computed tomography findings appear to have important prognostic value for estimating survival following transient ischemic attack. 
Surgical evaluation of Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Experience with 110 children. Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a disorder of unknown origin that is probably related to an autoimmune phenomenon. This report concerns 110 children (mean age, 6.2 years; range, 6 months to 14 years) with Henoch-Schonlein purpura. Seventy-two (65%) had abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting, bloody stool, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Sixty patients with abdominal pain were evaluated and treated conservatively. However, 12 patients underwent laparotomy. Six underwent unnecessary appendectomy for wrongly diagnosed appendicitis. Bowel resection was performed in one patient for an obstructive ileal lesion. Six additional patients had intussusception; surgery was required in three, while barium enema reduction was successfully accomplished in three others. Massive gastric hemorrhage required ligation, vagotomy, and pyloroplasty in two instances. One child with severe scrotal pain, hemorrhage, and swelling underwent unnecessary scrotal exploration. Four additional patients with similar symptoms avoided operation after a testicular scintiscan demonstrated good blood flow. A high index of suspicion and early diagnosis of Henoch-Schonlein purpura based on clinical, roentgenographic, and laboratory findings may avoid unnecessary operations in most cases. However, life-threatening complications (hemorrhage, obstruction, and intussusception) may occur and require operative intervention. All of the patients survived. 
Complications of diverticular disease and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs: a prospective study. Previous retrospective studies have suggested an association between consumption of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the complications of diverticular disease. Ninety-two patients were entered into a prospective study of the complications of diverticular disease over a 3 year period; 31 were taking NSAIDs, compared with only four age- and sex-matched controls from a representative general practice (P less than 0.001). A second control group comprised 306 patients with cancer of the colon in whom NSAID consumption was again significantly lower than in patients with diverticular disease (22 of 306 versus 31 of 92, P less than 0.001). Of the 31 patients taking NSAIDs, 19 presented with a perforation or peritonitis. By contrast, only eight of the 61 patients not taking NSAIDs had such complications (P less than 0.001). Eleven patients presented with bleeding of whom five were taking NSAIDs and six were not. Patients admitted with complications of diverticular disease have a high incidence of NSAID intake, and it appears that NSAID consumption is associated with a more severe form of the disease. 
A1-adenosine receptor inhibition of adenylate cyclase in failing and nonfailing human ventricular myocardium. BACKGROUND. Receptors that couple via the stimulatory G protein, Gs, to adenylate cyclase and to a positive inotropic response have been extensively investigated in falling human heart. In contrast, much less is known about receptors, such as the A1-adenosine receptor, that couple to adenylate cyclase via the inhibitory G protein, Gi, to give a negative inotropic response. Activation of such Gi-coupled receptors might worsen heart failure. Furthermore, alpha Gi is increased in failing human ventricular myocardium, which may enhance inhibitory receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase. METHODS AND RESULTS. A1-Adenosine receptor inhibition of adenylate cyclase was examined in crude particulate preparations derived from 12 nonfailing and 12 failing human left ventricles. Experimental conditions were designed for maximal inhibitory responses. Dose-response curves were performed with the selective A1-adenosine receptor agonist R-phenylisopropyl-adenosine (R-PIA). No differences in nonfailing versus failing heart were observed for basal adenylate cyclase activity (49.0 +/- 4.1 versus 45.7 +/- 2.6 pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg), maximal R-PIA-mediated inhibition (31.1 +/- 2.6 versus 30.2 +/- 1.6 pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg), ED50 (R-PIA x 10(-7) 1.28 +/- 0.10 versus 1.36 +/- 0.08), or slope (1.06 +/- 0.06 versus 1.03 +/- 0.10), respectively. Furthermore, fluoride, forskolin, and manganese adenylate cyclase activation were not different in failing heart, which is consistent with no change in the catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase. The inhibitory G protein alpha Gi, as quantitated by pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, was increased in failing heart (105.7 +/- 5.8 versus 132.7 +/- 3.4 optical density units, p less than 0.003). Basal adenylate cyclase activity was reduced in failing heart (7.8 +/- 0.8 versus 4.5 +/- 0.4 pmol cyclic AMP/min/mg, p less than 0.005) with assay conditions designed to assess G protein effects. CONCLUSIONS. The A1-adenosine receptor pathway exerts a major inhibitory effect on human myocardial adenylate cyclase activity. Although alpha Gi was increased in failing heart, A1-adenosine receptor inhibition of adenylate cyclase was not altered in preparations of failing versus nonfailing human ventricular myocardium. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and peptic ulcer disease. An overview. Evidence is accumulating that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is linked to ulceration of the stomach and duodenum and can cause significant, life-threatening ulcer complications. The mechanism of action seems to be both topical damage to the mucosal barrier and the systemic effect of a reduction in levels of mucosal prostaglandins. Patients especially at risk are the elderly, those with concomitant debilitating disease, those with a history of ulcers, and those taking corticosteroids. Histamine2 blockers are reported to significantly reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer, and misoprostol (Cytotec) has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced gastric ulcer. Prophylaxis with these agents should be considered for high-risk patients who need NSAID therapy to maintain a reasonable life-style. 
Cervical dystonia: clinical findings and associated movement disorders. We studied 300 patients, 61% women, with mean age 49.7 years and mean duration of dystonia 7.8 years, to determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of cervical dystonia (CD) and its relationships to other movement disorders. Torticollis was present in 82%, laterocollis in 42%, retrocollis in 29%, and anterocollis in 25%; however, the majority (66%) had a combination of these abnormal postures. Scoliosis was present in 39%, local pain reported by 68%, and 32% had evidence of secondary cervical radiculopathy. In addition to CD, 16% of patients had oral dystonia, 12% mandibular dystonia, 10% hand/arm dystonia, and 10% had blepharospasm. Tremor was noted in 71% of patients; head-neck tremor was present in 60%, and tremor in other body regions was present in 32%. A family history of a movement disorder was present in 44% of the CD patients. Tardive dystonia was the cause in 6%; 11% had posttraumatic dystonia. Anticholinergic drugs provided moderate improvement in 33% of patients, but local intramuscular botulinum toxin injections relieved CD, local pain, or both in over 90% of all treated patients. 
Diagnosis and management of Kawasaki disease. Kawasaki disease is an acute vasculitis characterized by mucosal inflammation, rash, cervical adenopathy, indurative edema of the hands and feet, and late membranous desquamation of the fingertips. Early cardiac effects include myocarditis (occasionally with congestive heart failure), pericardial inflammation, and, rarely, valve involvement. Coronary artery aneurysms are a long-term concern because coronary thrombosis with myocardial infarction can be a late manifestation. The origin of Kawasaki disease is unknown, but an infectious agent is most likely. Management consists of aspirin for control of fever and inflammatory manifestations and intravenous gamma globulin for the prevention of coronary aneurysm formation. Careful late follow-up is required, especially for patients with persistent coronary abnormalities. Giant aneurysms (greater than 8 mm) are more likely to progress to coronary obstructive disease, and coronary bypass grafts have been required for some patients. Late coronary artery manifestations in patients with mild early coronary dilatation have not been described. However, since long-term epidemiologic studies have not yet been performed, it is prudent to consider childhood Kawasaki disease to be a potential risk factor for coronary disease, especially in atherosclerosis-prone Western societies. 
Occurrence of stroke associated with use/abuse of drugs. Ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke frequently occur in temporal association with use or abuse of illicit and over-the-counter (OTC) sympathomimetic drugs. However, little information is available on the proportion of strokes associated with use/abuse of drugs in specific hospital populations. Between September 1, 1988, and August 1, 1989, 167 of 178 stroke patients entered into the Maryland Stroke Data Bank were asked for a history of drug use or abuse. Information was incomplete in 51 of 167 (31%) patients due to neurologic deficit or lack of inquiry. Eleven of the remaining 116 cases (9.5%) were historically associated with drug use. Age range was 25 to 56 years (mean, 41 years). Stroke associated with drug use occurred in four of 62 (6%) cerebral infarcts, two of 28 (7%) intracerebral hemorrhages, and five of 26 (19%) subarachnoid hemorrhages (p = ns). Drugs included cocaine in five (45%), OTC sympathomimetics in three (27%), phencyclidine in two (18%), and heroin in one (9%). 
Identification of a gene located at chromosome 5q21 that is mutated in colorectal cancers Recent studies have suggested the existence of a tumor suppressor gene located at chromosome region 5q21. DNA probes from this region were used to study a panel of sporadic colorectal carcinomas. One of these probes, cosmid 5.71, detected a somatically rearranged restriction fragment in the DNA from a single tumor. Further analysis of the 5.71 cosmid revealed two regions that were highly conserved in rodent DNA. These sequences were used to identify a gene, MCC (mutated in colorectal cancer), which encodes an 829-amino acid protein with a short region of similarity to the G protein-coupled m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor. The rearrangement in the tumor disrupted the coding region of the MCC gene. Moreover, two colorectal tumors were found with somatically acquired point mutations in MCC that resulted in amino acid substitutions. MCC is thus a candidate for the putative colorectal tumor suppressor gene located at 5q21. Further studies will be required to determine whether the gene is mutated in other sporadic tumors or in the germ line of patients with an inherited predisposition to colonic tumorigenesis. 
Microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm. Patterns of vascular compression in unsuccessfully operated patients. To determine the causative factors of unsuccessful microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm, the follow-up results in 53 patients were assessed retrospectively. The mean follow-up period was 36 months. There were 32 patients who had compression of the seventh cranial nerve ventrocaudally by an anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) or a posterior inferior cerebellar artery. Of these 32 patients, 30 (94%) had excellent postoperative results. Of 14 patients with more severe compression by the vertebral artery, nine (64%) had excellent results, three (21%) had good results, and two (14%) had poor results; in this group, three patients with excellent results experienced transient spasm recurrence. There were seven patients in whom the meatal branch of the AICA coursed between the seventh and eighth cranial nerves and compressed the dorsal aspect of the seventh nerve; this was usually associated with another artery compressing the ventral aspect of the nerve ("sandwich-type" compression). Of these seven patients, five (71%) had poor results including operative failure in one and recurrence of spasm in four. The authors conclude that the clinical outcome was closely related to the patterns of vascular compression. 
A study of elastic tissue and actinic radiation in "aging," temporal arteritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and atherosclerosis. The actinic storm in the modern world. Solar radiation provokes a lifelong series of destructive changes in the supporting elastic tissues of "exposed" skin. Called actinic elastosis/lysis (or actinic "aging"), the sequence begins in early life as simple elastic hyperplasia, converts in middle life to progressive actinic elastotic degeneration, and, in late life, typically ends with a stage of resorption (elastolysis) and atrophy ("aged" skin). Superficial "exposed" arteries such as the temporal artery participate in the same sequence of degenerative elastotic changes, which, as in the skin, may provoke granulomatous responses in a few of the many subjects affected. In the case of the temporal artery, a contingent outcome may be giant cell (temporal) arteritis and its recognized systemic vascular expression, polymyalgia rheumatica. Actinic commotion at the surface of the body is often massive in degree and extent and may be expected to exert a deleterious autoimmune impact on the essential elastic tissues of the arterial system. For this reason, solar radiation should be recognized as a risk factor for other elastic-related vascular diseases, including atherosclerosis and aneurysms. Man-made radiations may be exacerbating the effects of predominant solar radiation. Of the many radiant bands that make up the actinic (electromagnetic) spectrum, little is known for certain about the identity of those that cause these prevalent disorders of elastic tissue. Until this void is filled, more care should be taken with solar and the other "safe" radiations. 
Memory and pain: tests of mood congruity and state dependent learning in experimentally induced and clinical pain. The associative network theory of memory [2] is outlined along with the concepts of mood congruity and state dependent learning. Two experiments are reported which investigate the occurrence of these effects where memory for pain is concerned. In experiment 1 the performance of 25 chronic pain patients was compared with that of 25 non-patient controls on a test involving both immediate and delayed recall of a mixed list of stimulus words of 3 types: pain-related, negative or neutral. No significant group differences were found in overall rates of immediate recall. As predicted, however, pain patients recalled more pain-related words than non-patient controls (P less than 0.001). On delayed recall the same significant group x word-type interaction was obtained (P less than 0.02), but in addition the non-patient controls recalled significantly more words overall (P less than 0.02). These results provide some evidence for the occurrence of a mood congruity effect. Experiment 2 investigated state dependent learning and mood congruity effects in experimentally induced pain. Twenty volunteer subjects were allocated to 1 of 4 conditions in which a wordlist (as in experiment 1) was presented following either a painful stimulus (cold pressor test) or a non-painful one (warm water) and was then recalled immediately following further exposure to stimulus conditions which were congruent with the original stimulus (warm/warm and cold/cold conditions) or non-congruent (warm/cold and cold/warm conditions). A 3-way split plot ANOVA yielded no significant main effects for group or word-type, but a significant interaction emerged between state at encoding and at recall (P less than 0.04). 
Colchicine and antineoplastic therapy for the prevention of restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions. The complexity of the events that culminate in intimal proliferation after arterial injury and similarities between this response and benign neoplasia suggest that conventional medical therapies will continue to be unsuccessful in preventing recurrent stenosis after percutaneous coronary revascularization. By preventing cell division after smooth muscle cell activation, antimitogenic therapy may inhibit the final common pathway in this complex chain of events and offset the apparent loss of local growth control. Colchicine, which causes metaphase arrest of cell division, has been shown in experimental studies to decrease the extent of atheromatous plaque formation and reduce the severity of arterial restenosis after balloon angioplasty. However, preliminary results from a randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial suggest that low dose colchicine (0.6 mg twice a day orally) does not prevent restenosis. The use of more potent antineoplastic agents is limited by the potential for life-threatening side effects. It is possible that these adverse effects can be averted by using novel drug delivery systems to administer antimitogenic therapy locally at the site of arterial injury or by using low dose synergistic combinations of antiproliferative agents. This review examines the potential role of antimitogenic therapy in the prevention of restenosis after coronary interventions and considers the possibility of an overlap of the therapeutic realms of interventional cardiology and medical oncology. 
Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study. Final results BACKGROUND. Atrial fibrillation in the absence of rheumatic valvular disease is associated with a fivefold to sevenfold increased risk of ischemic stroke. METHODS AND MAIN RESULTS. The Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation Study, a multicenter, randomized trial, compared 325 mg/day aspirin (double-blind) or warfarin with placebo for prevention of ischemic stroke and systemic embolism (primary events), and included 1,330 inpatients and outpatients with constant or intermittent atrial fibrillation. During a mean follow-up of 1.3 years, the rate of primary events in patients assigned to placebo was 6.3% per year and was reduced by 42% in those assigned to aspirin (3.6% per year; p = 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 9-63%). In the subgroup of warfarin-eligible patients (most less than 76 years old), warfarin dose-adjusted to prolong prothrombin time to 1.3-fold to 1.8-fold that of control reduced the risk of primary events by 67% (warfarin versus placebo, 2.3% versus 7.4% per year; p = 0.01; 95% confidence interval, 27-85%). Primary events or death were reduced 58% (p = 0.01) by warfarin and 32% (p = 0.02) by aspirin. The risk of significant bleeding was 1.5%, 1.4%, and 1.6% per year in patients assigned to warfarin, aspirin, and placebo, respectively. CONCLUSIONS. Aspirin and warfarin are both effective in reducing ischemic stroke and systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. Because warfarin-eligible patients composed a subset of all aspirin-eligible patients, the magnitude of reduction in events by warfarin versus aspirin cannot be compared. Too few events occurred in warfarin-eligible patients to directly assess the relative benefit of aspirin compared with warfarin, and the trial is continuing to address this issue. Patients with nonrheumatic atrial fibrillation who can safely take either aspirin or warfarin should receive prophylactic antithrombotic therapy to reduce the risk of stroke. 
Evidence for a new tumor-suppressor gene involved in gastrointestinal malignancies. Inactivation or loss of tumor-suppressor genes is believed to lead to the development or progression of malignancies. To determine whether a tumor-suppressor gene is located on chromosome 8, DNA was extracted from tumor and normal tissue of colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic specimens, and allele loss was investigated by Southern hybridization techniques with the chromosome 8 probe D8S7. Twenty-five percent of pancreatic carcinomas, 50% of gastric carcinomas, and 50% of colorectal carcinomas were found to have lost an allele on chromosome 8. These findings suggest the presence of a tumor-suppressor gene on chromosome 8, which is involved in colorectal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, and pancreatic carcinoma. Definition of the frequency with which this tumor-suppressor gene is involved in gastrointestinal malignancies will await the study of many patients who are classified as informative and the use of multiple probes for chromosome 8. 
Urethrovaginal fistula repair with Martius labial fat pad graft. Most urethrovaginal fistulas are iatrogenic and, like other urinary fistulas, significantly reduce the quality of the affected individual's life. The Martius labial fat pad graft facilitates the urologic care of these women. 
Free and supported stance in Parkinson's disease. The effect of posture and 'postural set' on leg muscle responses to perturbation, and its relation to the severity of the disease. Upright stance and its reflex control were studied in parkinsonian patients and in age-matched normal subjects. They stood unperturbed on a force-measuring surface (static conditions), or were displaced by movement of a supporting platform (dynamic conditions). During quiet stance the following variables were analysed, with eyes open or closed: position of the centre of foot pressure (CFP), average sway area, length of sway path, amplitude and distribution of tonic leg muscle EMG activity. Perturbations of stance were induced by toe-up or toe-down rotations, and by backward or forward translations of the platform. Amplitude of short, medium and long-latency EMG responses to displacement were measured in the tibialis anterior (TA) and in the three heads of the triceps surae (TS) muscle. The perturbations were produced during both free and supported stance (holding onto a stable structure), under which condition normal subjects suppress medium and long-latency responses. Under static conditions, the only significant finding in parkinsonians was represented by a shift in the position of the CFP. This was correlated with the severity of the disease (Webster scale), the less affected patients being shifted backwards and the more affected patients forwards, with respect to normals. Under dynamic conditions, the reflex responses to perturbations of free stance were similar in both groups. Only the medium-latency burst of gastrocnemius lateralis and the long-latency burst TA evoked by TS stretch were larger in parkinsonians. The amplitude of these responses, as well as of all the others, was not related to the Webster score. Within the patients' group, a relationship between position of CFP and area of EMG burst was found for both medium and long-latency TA responses evoked by forward translation and toe-up rotation, respectively. Under supported conditions, the capability to suppress all medium and long-latency muscle responses to any perturbation was lost or impaired in the parkinsonians. The degree of impairment was unrelated to the position of the CFP, but was significantly related to the severity of the disease. The suppression to 40% (supported/nonsupported), of TA response to toe-down rotation is proposed as the point of separation between normals and parkinsonians. The forward projection of the CFP, occurring in the severe stages of the disease, and the increase in amplitude of some responses to perturbations of free stance might be a compensatory adaptation to the anomalous upright posture.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
The differential effects of biofeedback in the treatment of menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of biofeedback training in the treatment of menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine. Accordingly, 39 female patients suffering from both migraine associated, and migraine not associated, with menstrual periods were drawn from a pool of research volunteers enrolled in a biofeedback treatment program for migraine headaches. All patients were required to complete 5 weeks of daily self-monitoring of headache and menstruation activity immediately before and after treatment, and again at 6-month follow-up. Within-subjects comparisons of the effects of biofeedback on menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine, and between-subjects comparisons of the effects of biofeedback on patients suffering predominantly from either menstrual or nonmenstrual migraine showed that biofeedback is just as effective in reducing menstrual migraine as it is in reducing nonmenstrual migraine. Questions as to whether or not these conclusions can apply to patients who experience migraine headaches only during, or shortly before or after, menstruation, are raised. 
Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid presenting as multifocal bronchial carcinoid tumour. A 21 year old man presented with diarrhoea and flushing after meals and later developed miliary shadowing on his chest radiograph. Multifocal bronchial carcinoid tumour was diagnosed initially, but at necropsy metastatic medullary carcinoma of the thyroid was found. Multifocal bronchial carcinoid tumour should not be accepted as a primary diagnosis without first excluding medullary carcinoma of the thyroid because of the need to screen relatives of affected patients. 
Descending thoracic aorta-splenic artery graft for occlusive disease of the celiac axis. A new procedure is presented for the restoration of normal blood flow to the celiac axis in cases of orifice lesions of the celiac artery. The operation consists of inserting a graft between the descending thoracic aorta end-to-side and the divided splenic artery end-to-end. 
Pseudohypacusis. This article provides the basis for the techniques and interpretation of audiologic tests useful in evaluation of the patient with pseudohypacusis. Differences between the childhood and adult forms of the problem are discussed. The indications for currently popular conventional and special tests are presented. These include both behavioral and electrophysiologic measures for assessing auditory function. 
The impact of ulcerogenic drugs on surgery for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease. To investigate the impact of ulcerogenic drugs on surgery for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, we reviewed 150 surgical cases. Ulcerogenic drug use (steroids and/or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including aspirin) increased from 15% between 1972 and 1977 to 37% between 1983 and 1988. While there was no correlation between ulcerogenic drug use and hemorrhage, obstruction, or intractable pain, 16 (52%) of the 31 perforations and 26 (38%) of the 69 emergency operations were associated with use of ulcerogenic drugs. The overall mortality rate was 11%. Death was correlated with age greater than 65 years and emergency operation, but not with ulcerogenic drug use or other variables. Of 12 patients with histories of peptic ulcer disease who were treated with ulcerogenic drugs without concomitant antiulcer prophylaxis, 11 (92%) required emergency operation to treat perforation or massive hemorrhage. Standard antiulcer medications or misoprostol should be prescribed to elderly patients and to those with histories of ulcers who require ulcerogenic drug therapy. 
Cardiac disturbances during the administration of taxol. The clinical development of taxol, a new antimicrotubule agent with a unique mechanism of cytotoxic action, has proceeded slowly due to serious hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) and shortages in its supply. Nevertheless, large-scale phase II trials have been initiated as taxol has recently demonstrated impressive activity in advanced and cisplatin-refractory ovarian carcinoma. Furthermore, the incidence of HSRs has been reduced substantially with premedications and modifications in the administration schedule. However, various manifestations of potential cardiotoxicity have been observed in several patients who participated in four phase I and II studies of taxol. Asymptomatic bradycardia has occurred in a high proportion of patients, including 29% of ovarian cancer patients who were treated with maximally tolerated doses of taxol in a phase II study. More profound cardiac disturbances, including a range of atrioventricular conduction blocks, left bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and manifestations of cardiac ischemia, have been observed in seven of 140 patients (5%) who received taxol. Descriptions of these events are presented in this report to alert investigators to the potential for these adverse effects. Although these disturbances did not result in serious sequelae in most patients, investigators should continue to maintain a high degree of caution until precise risk factors, frequency, and clinical significance of these adverse cardiac effects are determined. 
Application of intermediate biomarkers to studies of cancer prevention in the gastrointestinal tract: introduction and perspective. In this article, abnormalities in the proliferation and differentiation of gastrointestinal cells are described in diseases that increase predisposition to gastrointestinal cancer. Recent findings related to the effects of calcium on gastrointestinal cell proliferation, differentiation, and tumor occurrence in rodent models and in human subjects are summarized. 
Usefulness of esmolol in unstable angina pectoris. European Esmolol Study Group. Esmolol is a new cardioselective beta blocker with unique pharmacokinetic properties resulting in a half-life of only 9 minutes. The present multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled study examined the hemodynamic and antiischemic effects of this compound given as an adjunctive to conventional medical therapy in 113 patients with unstable angina. Fifty-nine patients received esmolol and 54 received matching placebo infusions. Esmolol was titrated in a step-wise manner at dosages of 2 to 24 mg/min until a 25% reduction in the double product was achieved; thereafter, esmolol was continuously infused for up to 72 hours. Esmolol caused a significant and persistent decline in heart rate and blood pressure throughout the entire study period. Clinical events, such as development of acute myocardial infarction or the need for urgent revascularization, occurred in 3 esmolol compared with 9 placebo patients (p = 0.06). There was also a trend toward reduction of silent ischemia as judged by Holter monitoring (mean [+/- standard deviation] duration/patient/24 hours, 21 +/- 81 minutes in the esmolol and 35 +/- 128 minutes in the placebo groups). Esmolol-related adverse effects were mostly cardiovascular in origin and could be managed promptly by downward dose titration or cessation of drug infusion. Thus, esmolol appears to be a safe and effective drug for patients with unstable angina because it permits a large degree of flexibility in adapting the desired level of beta blockade to the patient's changing clinical presentation. 
Allopurinol pretreatment improves evoked response recovery following global cerebral ischemia in dogs. The reperfusion of previously ischemic tissue may lead to the formation of highly reactive free radicals that promote tissue injury. Xanthine oxidase has been implicated as one source of these free radicals. We examined the role of xanthine oxidase in brain injury using a cerebrospinal fluid compression model of global cerebral ischemia with 15 minutes of ischemia and 4 hours of reperfusion. Seven dogs were pretreated with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol (50 mg/kg for 5 days). Neurophysiological recovery was monitored with cortical somatosensory evoked potentials. As an attempt to correlate brain recovery with the mechanism of protection, free brain malondialdehyde was measured at the end of reperfusion by high-performance liquid chromatography. Brain water content was measured by wet-dry weights. Compared with seven untreated control dogs, allopurinol pretreatment significantly improved recovery of somatosensory evoked potentials after 4 hours of reperfusion. However, the amount of free malondialdehyde in the allopurinol-treated dogs was 32% greater than that in the controls. Brain water content was similar in the two groups. These results suggest that xanthine oxidase contributes to brain injury after ischemia and reperfusion. However, tissue damage caused by xanthine oxidase may be mediated through mechanisms other than free radical production. 
The mechanisms and prevention of intravascular fluid loss after occlusion of the supraceliac aorta in dogs. Mechanisms of intravascular fluid depletion after temporary occlusion of the supraceliac aorta were investigated in a canine model. During ischemia and reperfusion, hemodynamic parameters, superior mesenteric artery flow, intestinal mucosal perfusion, and mucosal permeability were monitored. After 12 hours of reperfusion, the volumes of intravenous electrolyte fluid required to maintain hemodynamic stability and fluid lost into the gastrointestinal tract and peritoneal cavity were measured. The distribution of total body water was analyzed by use of radionuclide dilution techniques. Group A animals underwent laparotomy only, group B had the supraceliac aorta occluded for 45 minutes, group C had superoxide dismutase administered after 45 minutes of aortic occlusion, and group D animals were exposed to mild hypothermia during a similar ischemia and reperfusion period. No significant difference was found in mean superior mesenteric artery flow or mucosal perfusion during ischemia among groups B, C, and D. During reperfusion superior mesenteric artery flow returned to values similar to control in all groups. Aortic occlusion increased mucosal permeability most significantly in group B (p less than 0.01). Mean intravenous fluid requirements (ml/mg) were the following: group A, 80 +/- 5; group B, 201 +/- 9 (p less than 0.01); group C, 116 +/- 7 (p less than 0.05); group D, 245 +/- 24 (p less than 0.05). Mean gastrointestinal fluid loss was highest in the hypothermic group and smallest if superoxide dismutase was given. Mean intracellular fluid volume was increased in groups B and D compared with group A (p less than 0.01). 
Reperitonealization of the lesser curve in proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer. Ninety-six consecutive patients were operated upon with proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer at our department during the two year period 1976 to 1978. These patients were prospectively randomized into two groups, one of which (45 patients) had reperitonealization of the lesser curve. These two groups are compared herein. Reperitonealization of the lesser curve was without benefit on long term clinical results, ulcer recurrence rate and gastric acid secretion. None of the patients had perforation of the lesser curve. 
Reversible thyroid dysfunction during treatment with GM-CSF. To investigate whether autoimmunity against thyroid antigens is induced or exacerbated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, thyroid function and thyroid autoantibodies were studied in 14 patients with advanced breast cancer and 11 with soft-tissue sarcoma who received several cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide plus GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2 intravenously daily for 10 days in every 21 day cycle. All patients had normal thyroid function before treatment. In 2 patients with pre-existing thyroid antibodies, thyroid dysfunction developed but disappeared after cessation of GM-CSF. No other autoimmune abnormalities appeared. Stimulation of antigen-presenting cells by GM-CSF may bring about this phenomenon. 
Neutrophil chemotaxis in gastric mucosa. A signal-to-response comparison. This prospective study compares levels of neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) in gastric juice to the neutrophil count in gastric biopsies. Sixty-three male patients enrolled in the study and had antral biopsies following collection of gastric juice during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Biopsies were examined for the magnitude of gastritis, tissue PMN count, and presence of Helicobacter pylori. Secretions were assayed for neutrophil chemotactic activity. Results show an increase in NCA and in tissue PMN counts with increasing severity of gastritis. H. pylori-positive patients had higher levels of NCA and PMN than H. pylori-negative patients. Wide variability in NCA levels preclude a direct correlation between NCA and PMN counts. 
The Sugiura procedure for patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis. The Sugiura procedure (SP) was performed upon 27 patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (EPVT) without associated hepatic disease. There were 14 female and 13 male patients. The mean age was 28 +/- 14 years. The causes of EPVT were protein C deficiency in two; antithrombin III deficiency in one patient, a history of omphalitis in two patients, a history of pancreatitis in one patient and idiopathy in 21 patients. The SP was completed in two surgical stages in 14 patients and in one stage in nine. There was one operative death. One patient had mild postoperative encephalopathy, and two patients rebled at long term follow-up study. Actuarial survival rate was 82 per cent at five and ten years. It is concluded that the SP is a good alternative for the management of hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to EPVT. 
Early and late geometric changes after carotid endarterectomy patch reconstruction. This study examines the degree and location of vessel wall geometric changes after carotid endarterectomy-vein patch reconstruction. The external diameters of the proximal common carotid, common carotid bulb, and internal carotid arteries were measured during operation with a caliper after 349 carotid endarterectomies. There were 309 saphenous vein reconstructions, 31 synthetic patch reconstructions, and 9 primary closures. One or more B-mode ultrasound studies with cross-sectional views for common and internal carotid cursor measurements were performed from 3 months to 5 years after operation. The intraoperative-to-postoperative common carotid diameters were unchanged for the three types of reconstructions. The internal carotid diameters increased 20% to 30% for both the vein and synthetic patched arteries. This dilation was present at 3 and 6 months and progressed slightly over 5 years. Wall thickening greater than or equal to 1 mm was present in 62% of the carotid endarterectomies, with concentric stenosis in 3% and eccentric stenosis in 59%. Eccentric stenosis was present at 3 to 6 months, located on the endarterectomized posterior-medial wall of the common and internal carotid arteries, was always less than 50%, and changed very little over 5 years. No aneurysms or internal carotid occlusions were identified. Carotid endarterectomy-vein patch reconstruction results in early, mild, nonaneurysmal dilation of the internal carotid patched segment, frequent mild eccentric restenosis, and rare hemodynamically significant concentric restenosis. 
Parkinson's disease rigidity: magnetic motor evoked potentials in a small hand muscle. We studied the EMG potentials evoked in the bilateral first dorsal interosseus muscle by electromagnetic stimulation of the corticomotoneuronal descending system in 10 Parkinson's disease patients and in 10 age- and sex-matched normal controls. We selected patients who did not have tremor but had predominant rigidity with asymmetric body involvement. On the rigid side of the PD patients, the threshold to cortical stimulation was lower than on the contralateral side or than normal values. On average, patients had normal central conduction times, but their motor evoked potentials (MEPs) on the rigid side were larger than those of controls when the cortical stimulus was at rest or during slight tonic contraction of the target muscle. In the latter condition, a silent period shorter than that of controls followed MEPs, whereas the peripheral silent period following ulnar nerve stimulation at the wrist was prolonged. Alpha motor neuron excitability, tested by the F-wave method, was enhanced on the rigid side at rest. In rigidity, spinal motor nuclei may be more responsive than normal to descending inputs from motor cortex, or the entire corticomotoneuron system may prove hyperexcitable under given conditions. 
A case of extragenital choriocarcinoma in the jejunum. A case of extragenital choriocarcinoma which produces human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) in the small intestine of a 48-yr-old Japanese women is reported. Only seven such cases have been reported. The patient complained of postprandial upper abdominal pain and vomiting of 5 months' duration. Nine years before, right upper lobectomy was performed because of lung undifferentiated carcinoma. Double-contrast examination of the small intestine showed irregular ulceration in the lower jejunum. Celiac angiography demonstrated a hypervascular tumor stain in the branch of the jejunal artery. The serum HCG level was elevated. Gynecological examination revealed nothing abnormal. A small intestinal neoplasm was diagnosed, and a partial resection of the jejunum was performed. Endoscopy on the operating table showed a large, irregularly shaped sessile ulcer. Histologically the tumor was diagnosed as choriocarcinoma, composed of syncytiotrophoblastic cells and cytotrophoblastic cells. Immunohistochemical staining for HCG was positive. No metastasis was present. Although extragenital choriocarcinoma in the small intestine is rare, it should be included in the differential diagnosis of small intestinal neoplasm. 
Non-neoplastic pineal cysts. We identified 53 patients with non-neoplastic cysts of the pineal gland. In contrast to patients with pineal neoplasms, pineal cysts are usually asymptomatic. They infrequently obstruct the aqueduct to cause hydrocephalus or compress the tectum to produce the neuro-ophthalmologic signs of dorsal midbrain dysfunction. Obstructive hydrocephalus was present in only five patients (9.4%); three of them showed clinical signs of Parinaud's syndrome. CT and MRI typically reveal a cystic mass that averages 1.6 cm in anteroposterior (A-P) diameter with calcification at the periphery and faint rim-like contrast enhancement. Sagittal MRI is the most useful diagnostic test because it shows the anatomic relationship of the cyst to the aqueduct. The mass may compress the tectum and distort the proximal aqueduct; occasionally a large cyst may occlude the aqueduct. All patients with obstructive hydrocephalus had cysts greater than 2.0 cm in A-P diameter. Nine patients had suboccipital craniotomy. In all of them, the cysts contained clear fluid and were easily removed. We advocate conservative management with clinical observation of these benign lesions that may be developmental variants of normal pineal gland. 
Superior vena cava occlusion in a patient with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. A 55-year-old woman with a lupus like disease, associated with the lupus anticoagulant, was admitted because of facial edema. Her facial swelling was previously attributed to the steroids she had been taking and they were tapered without improvement. Laboratory tests revealed high titers of anticardiolipin antibodies. Computerized tomography of her chest and Doppler ultrasound examination of her neck veins demonstrated a thrombus in the superior vena cava. She was treated with heparin and was maintained with longterm warfarin therapy with uneventful followup. Superior vena cava obstruction should be added to the long list of thromboembolic complications of the antiphospholipid syndrome. 
Barrett's mucosa in conjunction with squamous carcinoma of the esophagus. Fifty esophagectomies (32 specimens with squamous cell carcinoma and 18 with adenocarcinoma) were reviewed for the presence of Barrett's mucosa. The whole resected specimens were cut, and a total of 1677 blocks (measuring up to 4.0 x 0.5 cm) were obtained. In resections with squamous cell carcinoma, a mean of 33.6 sections (range, 16 to 55 sections) were excised, and in those with adenocarcinomas, a mean of 33.4 sections (range, ten to 60 sections) were cut. Barrett's mucosa (without or with dysplasia) was present in all 18 specimens with an adenocarcinoma (100%) and in 13 of the 32 specimens (40.6%) with squamous cell carcinoma. In ten of the 13 specimens with squamous cell carcinoma, adjacent areas with high-grade squamous cell dysplasia were found. The squamous cell carcinoma and/or the adjacent squamous cell dysplasia were found separated from the Barrett's mucosa by normal squamous epithelium, supporting the view that these two lesions are not related to one another. Early clinical and experimental data showed that squamous cell dysplasia antedated the development of squamous cell carcinoma in that organ. One possible suggestive of these findings is that the detection of a Barrett's esophagus (without or with dysplasia) should prompt the endoscopist also to examine carefully the rest of the esophagus to exclude mucosal alterations possibly connected with squamous cell carcinogenesis in that organ. 
Intractable ulcerating enterocolitis of infancy. Five children (three boys, two girls) presenting in the first year of life with intractable diarrhoea had a number of features in common. All had ulcerating stomatitis, four had partial villous atrophy on small intestinal biopsy, all had colitis characterised by large ulcers with overhanging edges, and four had severe perianal disease; no stool pathogens were detected. Treatment with steroids, sulphasalazine, and azathioprine was unsuccessful. All five required subtotal colectomy. Four were children of consanguinous marriages, two were siblings of Pakistani origin, two were cousins of Arab origin, and the fifth was Portuguese. Although the diagnoses of Behcet's disease and Crohn's disease were considered, it appears that these children represent a distinct inherited condition affecting the whole gastrointestinal tract, particularly the colon. 
Efficacy of gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging for differentiation between superficial and muscle-invasive tumor of the bladder: a comparative study with computerized tomography and transurethral ultrasonography. Gadolinium-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was evaluated in an effort to clarify whether MRI could replace or be proved to be superior to computerized tomography (CT) and/or transurethral ultrasonography. A total of 57 bladder cancer patients was evaluated. MRI was performed with a superconducting magnet operating at 1.5 Tesla. The images acquired were multisections, having a fast spin-echo pulse sequence of less than a 14-second breath holding. Serial scans were performed before and immediately after Gd-DTPA venous injection. The findings on different imaging techniques were compared with the histological stagings. A proper diagnosis was made in 42 of 57 cases (73.7%) by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI, in 27 of 57 (47.4%) by CT and in 31 of 57 (54.4%) by transurethral ultrasonography when comparing the histological findings. The sensitivity and specificity for differentiating superficial and muscle-invasive tumor of each imaging method were, respectively, 96.2 and 83.3% in Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI, 96.0 and 58.3% in CT, and 88.0 and 66.7% in transurethral ultrasonography. These data suggest that the staging of bladder cancer by Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRI appears to be superior and more accurate than the staging obtained by CT and transurethral ultrasonography. 
A prospective study to evaluate the dose of vitamin D required to correct low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, calcium, and alkaline phosphatase in patients at risk of developing antiepileptic drug-induced osteomalacia. The dose of vitamin D3 required to maintain normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels in epileptic patients was evaluated in a prospective study. Patients were divided into two groups, comprising 14 institutionalized and 18 non-institutionalized subjects; they were taking carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbitone, alone or in combination. The study was divided into a dose titration stage and a further period of assessment on a fixed dose after attainment of normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. Seventeen of the 18 non-institutionalized patients achieved normal levels over a period of 12 months; the remaining patient became normal after 15 months. The dose required to achieve normal levels ranged from 400 to 4000 IU/day; three patients required less than 2400 IU vitamin D3, 12 required 2400 IU and three required greater than 2400 IU. All institutionalized patients achieved normal levels over a period of 12 months; six patients required less than 2400 IU, six required 2400 IU and two required greater than 2400 IU vitamin D3. Raised alkaline phosphatase levels occurred in 11 patients, and reverted to normal in six patients during the initial return of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels to normal. During the second 12 months, when patients were taking a fixed dose of vitamin D3, alkaline phosphatase increased in five patients who had achieved normal levels. During this phase normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels were not maintained in five patients. There was a significant seasonal variation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels institutionalized patients, being highest in June and lowest in December. Our findings show that while there was a wide range in the dose required to achieve normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels--between 400 and 4000 IU/day--78 per cent of patients responded to a dose of 2400 IU/day. 
Effects on quality of life with comprehensive rehabilitation after acute myocardial infarction. This investigation was designed to determine the impact of a brief period of cardiac rehabilitation, initiated within 6 weeks of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), on both disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life, exercise tolerance and return to work after AMI. With a stratified, parallel group design, 201 low-risk patients with evidence of depression or anxiety, or both, after AMI, were randomized to either an 8-week program of exercise conditioning and behavioral counseling or to conventional care. Although the differences were small, significantly greater improvement was seen in rehabilitation group patients at 8 weeks in the emotions dimension of a new disease-specific, health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire, in their state of anxiety and in exercise tolerance. All measures of health-related quality of life in both groups improved significantly over the 12-month follow-up period. However, the 95% confidence intervals around differences between groups at the 12-month follow-up effectively excluded sustained, clinically important benefits of rehabilitation in disease-specific (limitations, -2.70, 1.40; emotions, -4.86, 1.10, where negative values favor conventional care and positive values favor rehabilitation) and generic health-related quality of life (time trade-off, -0.062, 0.052; quality of well-being, -0.042, 0.035) or in exercise tolerance (-38.5, 52.1 kpm/min); also, return to work was similar in the 2 groups (relative risk, 0.93; confidence interval, 0.71, 1.64). 
Prediction of uneventful cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm from direct-current electrical cardioversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and flutter. The present study was undertaken to reassess prospectively the immediate and long-term results of direct-current electrical cardioversion in chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and to determine factors predicting clinical outcome of the arrhythmia after direct-current cardioversion. Two-hundred forty-six patients underwent direct-current electrical cardioversion and were followed during a mean of 260 days. Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predicting short- and long-term arrhythmia outcome. Cardioversion was achieved in 70% of patients with atrial fibrillation and in 96% of patients with atrial flutter. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that arrhythmia duration (p less than 0.001), type of arrhythmia (fibrillation vs flutter, p less than 0.02) and age (p less than 0.05) independently influenced conversion rate. On an actuarial basis, 42 and 36% of patients remained in sinus rhythm during 1 and 2 years, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the type of arrhythmia (p = 0.0008), low precardioversion functional class (p = 0.002) and the presence of nonrheumatic mitral valve disease (p = 0.03) independently increased the length of the arrhythmia-free episode. Rheumatic heart disease shortened this period (p = 0.03). In conclusion, patients having a high probability of conversion together with a prolonged post-shock arrhythmia-free episode can be identified. This may improve the cost-benefit ratio of cardioversion. 
Recurrent abdominal pain due to chronic appendiceal disease. Recurrent appendicitis and chronic appendicitis are the subjects of much controversy, but long-standing inflammation of the appendix and surrounding tissues has been reported in rare instances. We have described two patients, both with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, who subsequently were shown to have chronic appendiceal disease. Appendiceal disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with recurrent abdominal pain. 
Epilepsy: disappearing lesions appearing in the United Kingdom OBJECTIVE--Investigation of spontaneously resolving lesions associated with epilepsy. DESIGN--Observational study during one year. SETTING--One neurology department. PATIENTS--4 cases in patients (one of Indian parents, one African, one white English, and one Afro-Caribbean) resident in the United Kingdom, who presented with transient epilepsy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Findings on computed tomography and on screening for infections. RESULTS--In all four cases a small mass lesion in one cerebral hemisphere was observed on computed tomography, which resolved after 9, 4, 3 and 1.5 months respectively without surgery. CONCLUSIONS--The number of cases seen in one year suggests that the lesions may be more common in the United Kingdom than previously recognised and that research into their cause is warranted. 
Effect of beta-blockers on exercise physiology: implications for exercise training. We conducted a series of studies aimed at investigating the effect of beta-blockers on exercise physiology. On the basis of these and other existing studies, it is possible to draw the following conclusions and to make the following tentative recommendations for patients engaged in exercise training who receive beta-blocker therapy: i) CAD patients treated with beta-blockers are capable of deriving the expected enhancement of cardiorespiratory fitness during training, irrespective of the type of drug used; ii) beta1-selective blockers are preferable to nonselective agents for hypertensive patients engaged in exercise training; iii) because beta1-selective blockers impair exercise tolerance in some hypertensive patients, physicians should look out for this adverse reaction and, if present, consider alternative antihypertensive therapy; iv) intrinsic sympathomimetic activity confers no advantage during exercise training; v) exercise intensity prescription for patients receiving beta-blockers should be in accordance with traditional guidelines and based on results of individualized exercise testing performed on medication; vi) exercise training is desirable during beta-blocker therapy in that it appears to offset adverse alterations in lipoprotein metabolism; and vii) nonselective beta-blockers may increase predisposition to exertional hyperthermia, and patients must therefore be encouraged to adhere strictly to accepted guidelines for heat injury prevention. 
Classification and natural history of clinically identifiable subtypes of cerebral infarction. We describe the incidence and natural history of four clinically identifiable subgroups of cerebral infarction in a community-based study of 675 patients with first-ever stroke. Of 543 patients with a cerebral infarct, 92 (17%) had large anterior circulation infarcts with both cortical and subcortical involvement (total anterior circulation infarcts, TACI); 185 (34%) had more restricted and predominantly cortical infarcts (partial anterior circulation infarcts, PACI); 129 (24%) had infarcts clearly associated with the vertebrobasilar arterial territory (posterior circulation infarcts, POCI); and 137 (25%) had infarcts confined to the territory of the deep perforating arteries (lacunar infarcts, LACI). There were striking differences in natural history between the groups. The TACI group had a negligible chance of good functional outcome and mortality was high. More than twice as many deaths were due to the complications of immobility than to direct neurological sequelae of the infarct. Patients in the PACI group were much more likely to have an early recurrent stroke than were patients in other groups. Those in the POCI group were at greater risk of a recurrent stroke later in the first year after the index event but had the best chance of a good functional outcome. Despite the small anatomical size of the infarcts in the LACI group, many patients remained substantially handicapped. The findings have important implications for the planning of stroke treatment trials and suggest that various therapies could be directed specifically at the subgroups. 
Choleriform syndrome and production of labile enterotoxin (CT/LT1)-like antigen by species of Salmonella infantis and Salmonella haardt isolated from the same patient. Isolates of Salmonella infantis from the stool and blood and an isolate of Salmonella haardt from the stool of a patient with choleriform diarrhea produced labile enterotoxin (CT/LT1)-like antigen. Genetic and molecular experiments indicated that the production of CT/LT1-like antigen was chromosomally encoded. 
Transethmoid decompression of the optic nerve in head injuries: an update. Sixty-three patients with loss of vision following head injury were subjected to decompression of the optic nerve by the transethmoid route. This paper discusses the criteria for selection of patients for surgery, the results of the operation and the prognostic factors determining the results. 
CA 125 regression: a model for epithelial ovarian cancer response. The rate of decline of CA 125 in effectively treated epithelial ovarian cancer is described by the exponential regression curve CA 125 = EXP [i - s (days after surgery)]. In this equation i, the y-axis intercept, measures initial tumor burden whereas s, the slope of the regression curve, is determined by the extent of cytoreductive surgery and the subsequent response to chemotherapy. Departure from the regression curve uniformly results in progressive disease. In patients whose cancers had been completely removed, we calculated the mean half-life of CA 125 to be 10.4 days (range 4 to 21). In this case s = 0.0835 and characterizes the ideal regression rate. The model predicts that high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy (s = 0.0671) is more effective than low-dose cisplatin (s = 0.0380) (p less than 0.03) in eliminating residual cancer. Because s can be calculated within 2 to 3 months of treatment and then compared with s for the ideal regression curve and with the values of s reported for standard chemotherapy, evaluation of any new treatment protocol can be facilitated with this method. 
A randomized controlled trial of adjuvant immunotherapy (murine monoclonal antibody 494/32) in resectable pancreatic cancer. In a prospective randomized multicentric trial, 61 patients from six hospitals with resectable pancreatic cancer were recruited between 1987 and 1989. All patients underwent a Whipple resection. Two weeks after surgery, the patients were randomized to be given either intravenous (IV) treatment with 370 mg (100 mg loading dose, 9 x 30 mg continuing within 10 days) of monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 494/32 (Behringwerke AG, Marsburg, Germany) or no additional anti-cancer treatment. This murine immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody has been shown to strongly bind to human pancreatic cancer cells and to induce an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Both study groups were well matched with respect to age, sex, tumor staging, and grading. Six patients suffered from minor toxicity (vomiting and abdominal pain) after immunotherapy. Ten months after the end of the recruitment period, 65% and 53% of the patients in the treatment and control groups, respectively, had died. Of the living patients, 60% and 53% are alive with recurrent or progressive cancer disease. Median survival time was 428 days (range, 248 to 510 days) and 386 days (range, 296 to 509 days) in the treatment and control groups, respectively. The authors concluded that repeated IV treatment with the antibody 494/32 is not helpful in resectable pancreatic cancer. This study provides the first controlled data on passive immunotherapy in solid cancer. 
Immunohistochemical study of thyroid peroxidase in normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic human thyroid tissues. An immunohistochemical study using two monoclonal antibodies (MoAb 30 and MoAb 47) against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) was performed on surgical specimens of human thyroid carcinoma (n = 65), adenoma (n = 70) and Graves' disease (n = 10). Normal adjacent thyroid tissue was used as positive control. Monoclonal antibody 30 reacted significantly with all adenoma and most carcinoma, whereas MoAb 47 reacted with 66 adenoma but only two carcinoma. Of the four adenomas that did not react with MoAb 47, three were of the fetal type. Both carcinoma reacting with MoAb 47 were of the well-differentiated follicular type. These findings further confirm the hypothesis that thyroid carcinoma is associated with changes in the quantity and antigenic properties of TPO. Although the alterations in antigenic behavior revealed by MoAb 47 are not 100% specific, they may allow more accurate diagnosis of malignancy in thyroid tumors. 
Time course of intracellular edema and epileptiform activity following prenatal cerebral ischemia in sheep. The role of edema in the pathogenesis of hypoxic-ischemic injury in the immature brain is controversial. We studied 15 chronically instrumented fetal sheep following transient cerebral ischemia, to estimate changes in extracellular space using an impedance technique, to quantify the electroencephalogram with real-time spectral analysis, and to assess histologic outcome 3 days after the insult. These measurements were made in the parasagittal cortex. There was a rapid loss of extracellular space from 5 +/- 2 minutes after the onset of ischemia. Following 10 minutes of ischemia (n = 7) the intracellular edema peaked but then quickly resolved (6 +/- 4 minutes), and mild selective neuronal loss was seen. In contrast, the swelling was biphasic after 30-40 minutes of ischemia (n = 8). The early edema resolved slowly (28 +/- 12 minutes) but incompletely, and secondary swelling began at 7 +/- 2 hours and peaked at 28 +/- 6 hours. The early swelling was the more severe. Postinsult epileptiform activity began at 8 +/- 2 hours and peaked at 10 +/- 3 hours; later there was laminar necrosis of the underlying cortex. The secondary decrease of extracellular space indicates that a progressive loss of membrane function started with the onset of postischemic epileptiform activity. The increased metabolic load of the epileptiform activity may have worsened this delayed deterioration. 
Thermal ablation of the gallbladder. Gallbladder ablation by means of injection of hot contrast medium was attempted in 13 dogs. Room temperature contrast medium was injected into the gallbladders of two additional dogs (controls). After midline laparotomy was performed to expose the gallbladder, temperature probes were placed in the liver adjacent to the gallbladder, and on the surface and in the lumen of the gallbladder. A 7-F catheter with multiple side holes was placed into the gallbladder. The cystic duct was clamped during the procedure. After injection of boiling contrast medium, the mean temperature in the gallbladder lumen was 80 degrees C; in the adjacent liver, 43.5 degrees C; and on the gallbladder surface, 45.8 degrees C. After the procedure, the cystic duct was unclamped, temperature probes and catheter were removed, and the laparotomy was closed in standard fashion. In the hot contrast medium group, one dog each was sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and at 6 months. Six animals were sacrificed at 1 year. The gallbladder was completely ablated in 11 of 13 animals in the hot contrast medium group. One dog was sacrificed at 8 days because of bile leakage, and another was sacrificed at 17 days because of gallbladder rupture. The two control animals were sacrificed at 12 and 13 weeks, and their gallbladders were normal at that time. 
Hypnotically induced auditory hallucinations and the mouth-opening maneuver: a failure to duplicate findings. OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to replicate the part of a study by Bick and Kinsbourne in which hypnotically induced auditory hallucinations in normal volunteer subjects were abolished by requiring the subjects to open their mouths. METHODS: Sixty-four normal volunteer subjects were hypnotized, and an attempt was made to induce auditory hallucinations. The subjects in whom hallucinations were successfully induced were then asked to perform the mouth-opening maneuver and the control maneuvers of putting their fingers in their ears or squeezing their eyes shut in an effort to end the hallucinations. RESULTS: Sixteen subjects reported having hallucinations. None of them reported that a hallucination was abolished by opening the mouth or closing the eye; four reported ending hallucinations by putting their fingers in their ears. CONCLUSIONS: Opening the mouth does not affect auditory hallucinations induced by hypnosis in normal persons. The most likely reason for the discrepancy between the results of this experiment and those of the Bick and Kinsbourne study is that the design of the latter study was faulty because it permitted demand characteristics to influence the results. 
Evaluation, treatment, and follow-up results of post polio patients with dysphagia. Twenty consecutive patients were evaluated for reports of dysphagia from post-polio clinics. Only half the patients reported a history of swallowing problems at the time of their acute poliomyelitis. Each patient received a videofluorographic evaluation of the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing, and then was provided with recommendations to improve swallowing skills. A follow-up questionnaire was sent to all patients. The respondents had an average interval of 12 months since the initial evaluation. Of the 18 patients responding to the questionnaire, 14 (77%) reported regular use of the swallowing suggestions. Comparison of pre-evaluation results to followup of the 18 respondents yielded a statistically significant decline in the frequency of choking (p = 0.0156) and food sticking in the throat (p = 0.0195). We conclude that a dysphagia program can result in significant improvement of the swallowing symptoms reported with the post-polio population. 
Altered noradrenergic projection to hypothalamus via baroreflex in spontaneously hypertensive rats. To determine whether noradrenergic projections to the posterior hypothalamus via baroreflex are altered in the hypertensive state, the extracellular norepinephrine (NE) content of the posterior hypothalamus was measured in both spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) after sinoaortic denervation (SAD) or sham operation. In WKY, blood pressure (BP) and extracellular NE content 24 h after SAD were significantly higher than those of sham-operated rats. Contrarily, SAD did not increase both BP and NE in the posterior hypothalamus of SHR. These results suggest that the noradrenergic pathway via the baroreflex is impaired in SHR. This mechanism may play an important role in the development and maintenance of hypertension in SHR. 
Characteristics of left ventricular filling in coronary artery disease and myocardial ischaemia after dipyridamole provocation. Doppler echocardiographic measurement of transmitral filling velocities seems to be a sensitive marker for resting left ventricular diastolic abnormalities in patients with coronary artery disease. The behaviour of these filling velocities during induced myocardial ischaemia, however, has not been fully studied. Left ventricular filling was assessed by pulsed Doppler ultrasound in 21 patients with angina pectoris and coronary artery disease and in five controls (patients with chest pain but without myocardial ischaemia). High dose dipyridamole infusion (0.9 mg/kg over 10 minutes) was used to provoke myocardial ischaemia, which was assessed by symptoms and electrocardiographic ST segment change. Doppler indices of diastolic filling were measured and the results expressed as percentage change from baseline values. Dipyridamole increased the heart rate and reduced systolic blood pressure equally in both groups. In the controls dipyridamole increased the peak filling velocities of both the early and atrial filling waves. In the 12 patients with coronary artery disease who did not develop evidence of myocardial ischaemia, the effect on left ventricular filling velocity resembled that in the controls though the time to peak change was delayed. Six of the nine patients with dipyridamole induced myocardial ischaemia had a significantly reduced maximum changes in early (+30% v +18%) and atrial (-0.2% v +33%) filling velocities compared with the controls. The remaining three patients had a decrease in early filling velocity (-20%) with an associated increase in atrial peak filling velocity (+21%). Dipyridamole increased diastolic filling velocities in the controls. In patients with coronary artery disease there was a variable change in diastolic filling indices which may be attributed either to the degree of myocardial ischaemia or to the different haemodynamic changes occurring during myocardial ischaemia. 
Fine needle aspiration biopsy of superficial masses in children. Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is an underused diagnostic procedure in children, particularly in the evaluation of superficial masses. A total of 54 FNABs of superficial masses were performed in children aged 1 month to 15 years. Adequate material for diagnosis was obtained in 50 attempts. The cytologic diagnosis increased clinical understanding and provided a guide for treatment in 46 of the 50 cases. The cytologic diagnosis was confirmed in 15 of 19 patients who underwent an operation. Surgical intervention was obviated in 31 patients. There was one false-positive diagnosis of cancer. We describe the role of FNAB in children and its technique, accuracy, and diagnostic problems. 
A meta-analysis of prophylactic antibiotics in head and neck surgery. Although it is generally agreed that prophylactic antibiotics are necessary for the prevention of postoperative wound infection, the choice of antibiotic regimen is controversial. In an attempt to determine the most effective antibiotic regimen, a meta-analysis of published clinical trials of prophylactic antibiotics for head and neck surgery was undertaken. The meta-analysis revealed a relative difference in infection rates of 43.7 percent in favor of the use of antibiotics versus placebo, of 8.3 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus a single antibiotic, of 13.7 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus cefazolin, and of 4.1 percent in favor of multiple-day prophylaxis versus single-day prophylaxis. This meta-analysis suggests that a 1-day course of clindamycin may be the most effective prophylactic antibiotic regimen for head and neck surgery. 
Nonpalpable invasive breast cancer. The use of mammography has resulted in 1464 breast biopsies for nonpalpable abnormalities at the University of Virginia in the 10 years 1980 to 1989. Two hundred sixty-four cancerous lesions (18%) were found. One hundred seventy-eight of these (67%) were in situ lesions. Invasive cancer (86 of 264 lesions or 33%) forms the basis for this report. Mammographic findings leading to biopsy were a mass in 61 of 86 cases (71%), microcalcifications in 23 of 86 (27%), or both in 2 of 86 cases. Histologic subtypes were infiltrating ductal (63 of 86), infiltrating lobular (14 of 86), and other infiltrating (9 of 86). Mastectomy was performed in 71 of 86 lesions (82%), lumpectomy/radiation in 14 of 86 (16%), and lumpectomy alone in 1 of 86 lesions. Division of the tumors into size with nodal status revealed 19 of 86 lesions (22%) less than 0.5 cm with 0 of 14 positive nodes. Thirty-nine of eighty-six lesions (46%) measured 0.6 to 1.0 cm with 10 (26%) positive nodes. Twenty-eight of eighty-six lesions (32%) measured more than 1.0 cm with 8 of 28 (28%) positive nodes. Nodal status is unknown for eight patients. Overall 18 of 78 lesions (23%) had positive nodes. Median follow-up is 44 months. Disease-free survival rate is 92% (79 of 86 patients) and overall survival rate is 94% (81 of 86 patients). Six of seven recurrences occurred in node-positive patients. For those with negative or unknown nodes, the disease-free survival rate is 98% (67 of 68 patients). These findings emphasize the benefit of early detection of breast cancer through the use of mammography. 
Volume tests for chronic venous insufficiency: an appraisal. Chronic venous disease is increasingly treated surgically with a variety of experimental procedures. Noninvasive volume tests are commonly used before surgery to select patients and after surgery to assess results. Rapid volume changes are considered to indicate regurgitation. Rigorous statistical validation of tests and the confounding nature of unmeasured arterial inflow are seldom considered. Volume changes were measured in 29 control limbs and 35 limbs with venous disease, with mercury-in-silicone rubber strain gauges, for both exercise and elevation. Normalization for arterial flow permitted calculation of the regurgitation rate. Normal (95% confidence) limits for measured and calculated parameters were determined. Specificity was shown by the percent of normal parameter values for control limbs and sensitivity by the percent of abnormal values for extremities with venous disease. Arterial flow significantly altered volume curves. Normalization increased specificity and sensitivity significantly. Calf exercise tests, even normalized, were too insensitive to be reliable. Elevation tests were significantly more sensitive for determining regurgitation. However, exercise tests were useful and supplied important information about the calf muscle pump. We conclude that, as currently used, many limb volume test procedures are unsuitable but could be improved significantly by normalization to reduce the confounding effect of regional arterial flow and use of an elevation test to measure regurgitation. 
Angiographically assessed coronary arterial patency and reocclusion in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated with anistreplase: results of the anistreplase reocclusion multicenter study (ARMS). In this open multicenter study, 156 patients with acute myocardial infarction received 30 U of anistreplase intravenously over 5 minutes within 4 hours of the onset of chest pain. The patency of the infarct-related vessel was determined by coronary angiography 90 minutes after anistreplase treatment, and also 24 hours after treatment, in patients with a patent infarct-related vessel at 90 minutes, to assess the reocclusion rate. The investigators categorized the infarct-related vessel as patent or occluded, and 2 independent cardiologists graded the infarct-related vessel according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) perfusion criteria. At the 90-minute assessment, 106 of 145 evaluable patients (73%) had patent infarct-related vessels, and 39 of 145 (27%) had occluded infarct-related vessels. Of the 139 independently assessed patients, 98 (71%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3 and 41 (29%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. At the 24-hour assessment, 98 of 102 patients (96%) had a patent infarct-related vessel, and reocclusion had occurred in 4 of 102 patients (4%). Of the 94 independently assessed patients 90 (96%) had TIMI grades 2 or 3, and 4 (4%) had TIMI grades 0 or 1. The reliability of noninvasive parameters as indicators of achieved patency of the infarct-related vessel was estimated by means of correlation with patency assessed by coronary angiography. A significant correlation of 0.62 was found. The patency rate of 71 to 73% after use of anistreplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction corresponds with findings in earlier studies. The low reocclusion rate of 4% after use of anistreplase probably reflects the prolonged action of anistreplase. 
Prospective hospital based study on persistent diarrhoea. A total of 383 children aged less than 5 years suffering from acute watery diarrhoea or dysentery were studied in hospital to determine the rate of persistent diarrhoea. Altogether 335 (87.5%) recovered within 13 days. Only in 48 (12.5%) did the diarrhoea continue for 14 days or more, and they were considered as having persistent diarrhoea. Children aged between 7 and 18 months had a significantly increased incidence of persistent diarrhoea. Children suffering from grade II-IV malnutrition constituted the majority (70.8%) of those with persistent diarrhoea. Higher rates of isolation of Shigella flexneri, Shigella dysenteriae 1, and Salmonella typhimurium were observed among patients with persistent diarrhoea than in those with diarrhoea of shorter duration. No positive correlations were observed between the clinical severity of disease at hospital admission and measles. Breast fed babies were not prone to persistent diarrhoea. 
Magnetic resonance assessment of the postoperative spine. Degenerative disc disease. The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging findings in patients after surgery for degenerative disc disease in the lumbar and cervical spine are discussed. In the lumbar spine, changes seen in the immediate postoperative period, use of Gd-DTPA in distinguishing scar and disc and postoperative complications are reviewed. In the cervical spine, operative approaches and types, the appearance of bony stenosis, and disc herniations are demonstrated. 
MR imaging of small hepatocellular carcinoma: effect of intratumoral copper content on signal intensity. Small (less than 5 cm) hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) in 45 of 112 patients (40.2%) had a high-signal-intensity pattern (relative to that of liver) on T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images. To identify the cause of this pattern, specimens of histologically defined HCC with high- (n = 21), iso- (n = 6), and low- (n = 22) intensity patterns were histologically evaluated for paramagnetic ionic forms of metals. The incidence of steatosis, clear cell formation, and copper accumulation was statistically (P less than .01) higher in tumors with the high-intensity pattern than in those with other patterns. Of 17 HCCs that stained positive for copper, 16 (94%) had a high-intensity pattern; the pattern of one tumor (6%) was isointense. All 21 tumors with the high-intensity pattern had at least one of the findings of steatosis, clear cell formation, or copper accumulation. These features were evident in only four of 28 tumors (14%) with an iso- or low-intensity pattern. Thus, copper accumulation might be a cause of the high-intensity pattern on T1-weighted images of small HCCs. 
Experience with surgical resection of heterotopic bone in spinal cord injury patients. Extensive heterotopic ossification may occur after a spinal cord injury. Surgical removal of the heterotopic bone is considered only in patients who develop limitations of function or related skin pressure areas. In a prospective study of 21 patients, a total of 43 surgical procedures were performed to resect heterotopic bone. Long-term follow-up study was available for 18 patients who had 38 surgical procedures. This was a descriptive study since preoperative, surgical, and postoperative care varied slightly over time and were dependent on newer advances in surgical techniques and therapeutic agents. Primary complications included excessive bleeding, infection, fractures, and recurrence of the heterotopic ossification. Procedures are outlined that may reduce the incidence of postoperative infection. Fractures are related to the degree of regional osteoporosis. Recurrence is still a common problem, and any or all therapeutic agents that may reduce the extent of postoperative recurrence should be considered before surgical excision is planned. 
Decrease in resting metabolic rate during abstinence from bulimic behavior. Among eight normal-weight bulimic women studied during 1 week of binge eating and vomiting and 7 weeks of abstinence without weight loss, resting metabolic rate and T3 and T4 levels fell significantly during abstinence. These data suggest that a physiological consequence of binge eating and vomiting is an increase in metabolic rate, in part due to increased thyroid hormone activity. 
Reconstruction of the sternum and anterior chest wall using autologous tissues. We have described the successful reconstruction of a completely resected anterior chest wall using autologous tissues. This case demonstrates feasibility despite known potential contamination and serious postoperative physiologic dysfunction. 
Immediate mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates. Mandibular reconstruction at the time of tumor resection remains a surgical dilemma. Primary reconstruction allows for immediate reconstitution of mandibular form and function. Various methods have been attempted, but none enjoys uniform success. With advances in the field of microvascular surgery have come numerous options in replacing these defects. These procedures, however, require special surgical teams and are associated with an increase in operative time as well as morbidity at the donor site. An alternative method involves the use of mandibular reconstruction plates to bridge the defect between segments. This review focuses on 19 patients whose jaws were reconstructed in this fashion. Although not free of complications, mandibular plate reconstruction offers the advantages of (1) lack of donor site morbidity, (2) expediency, (3) excellent mandibular contour, and (4) the ability to reconstruct the condyle when necessary. The technique, results, and complications associated with this procedure are discussed. 
Aneurysm of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery unrelated to the cerebellopontine angle: case report. This is a case report of an unusual aneurysm of the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery. A 44-year-old woman had a severe frontal headache and vomiting of sudden onset. On the day after admission, the patient began to demonstrate nuchal rigidity and difficulty with upward gaze bilaterally. There were no complaints at this time suggestive of a syndrome of the cerebellopontine angle. A computed tomographic scan revealed an intraventricular hemorrhage of the 3rd and 4th ventricles; however, multiple attempts at four-vessel angiography were required before an aneurysm could be demonstrated. On the 28th hospital day, a suboccipital craniectomy using the retromastoid approach in the lateral position was performed. A saccular aneurysm with a surrounding hematoma in the distal anterior inferior cerebellar artery was found and clipped. The operative findings revealed that the aneurysm was unrelated to the cerebellopontine angle. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful recovery and complete resolution of symptoms. 
Astigmatism after small incision cataract surgery. A prospective, randomized, multicenter comparison of 4- and 6.5-mm incisions Four surgeons evaluated induced astigmatism and postoperative wound stability in a randomized prospective study of 130 patients undergoing cataract extraction. After phacoemulsification through a scleral pocket, patients received either a 6.5-mm diameter silicone optic posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC IOL) folded for insertion through a 4-mm small incision or a 6.0-mm diameter polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) optic PC IOL placed through an approximately 6.5-mm conventional incision. Vector analysis calculations of prism diopters (D) of mean postoperative-induced keratometric astigmatism for the small incision versus conventional incision groups were, at day 1, 1.54 D versus 3.07 D (P less than 0.0001); at weeks 1 to 2, 1.00 D versus 2.43 D (P less than 0.0001); at 1 month, 0.98 D versus 1.44 D (P = 0.004); and at 3 months, 0.82 D versus 1.03 D (P = 0.089). Subgroup analysis of the suturing technique for the 6.5-mm incision showed that the technique of wound closure, as well as the wound size, influenced the induced astigmatism. For all four surgeons using three methods of suturing the 6.5-mm wound, however, the variability in the amount of induced cylinder was least with the 4.0-mm wound closed with a horizontal mattress suture. Complications in the two groups were comparable. 
Difficult diagnoses in toxicology. Poisons not detected by the comprehensive drug screen. The comprehensive drug screen has serious limitations when used as the sole study for diagnosing intoxication. A careful history and physical examination in the poisoned patient can provide important clues that point to possible toxins. Ancillary studies help differentiate the most likely poison and guide treatment. Fortunately, most poison victims do well with supportive care alone. However, the clinician should be aware of agents that can cause significant harm to patients if not detected and treated quickly. Iron and carbon monoxide are good examples of lethal agents that need a high index of clinical suspicion for early recognition and require specific therapy to ensure a good outcome. Patients who overdose with clonidine, calcium-channel blockers, beta-adrenergic blockers, or albuterol must be managed expectantly and according to their clinical presentation because rapid laboratory verification is not available for these poisons. In all situations, the clinician must integrate information from history, physical examination, and laboratory to render the best care. 
Solitary pulmonary nodules: comparison of classification with standard, thin-section, and reference phantom CT. Standard, thin-section, and reference phantom computed tomography (CT) were performed to evaluate 75 consecutive patients with solitary pulmonary nodules. Follow-up was available for 62 nodules in 59 patients; 53 of the nodules were benign and nine were malignant. Twenty-one of the 62 nodules were assessed as benign with thin-section CT, while 33 of the 62 nodules were assessed as benign with reference phantom CT. Two of the nodules classified as benign with both thin-section and reference phantom CT proved to be malignant (a peripheral, ossified carcinoid and a 3.5-cm-diameter calcified carcinoma). The sensitivity of reference phantom CT (58%) for classification of benign nodules was higher than the sensitivity of thin-section CT (36%). The sensitivity of standard CT was lowest (12%). The presence of fat at thin-section CT was a reliable criterion for benignancy in six hamartomas. While both thin-section and reference phantom CT were useful in the identification of benign pulmonary nodules, reference phantom CT increased sensitivity by 22% compared with thin-section CT. 
Medulloblastoma: long-term follow-up of patients treated with electron irradiation of the spinal field. Thirty-two patients with posterior fossa medulloblastoma underwent treatment with electron irradiation to the spinal field. The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 57% and 50%, respectively. Late complications observed in the 15 patients followed up for more than 5 years were short stature (six patients), decreased sitting-standing height ratio (four patients), scoliosis (two patients), poor school performance (seven patients), xerostomia (one patient), esophageal stricture (one patient), pituitary dysfunction (four patients), primary hypothyroidism (one patient), bilateral eighth-nerve deafness (one patient), and carcinoma of the thyroid (one patient). Complications following treatment with electrons to a spinal field are compared with reported complications following treatment with photons to the spinal field. Although short-term reactions were minimal, the authors found no difference in late complications. More sophisticated treatment planning may show such a long-term benefit in the future. 
Psychological events are both risk factors in, and consequences of, chronic pain. This study questioned 2 assumptions often inherent in psychogenic explanations of pain: (1) that a relationship exists between pain and life events predating pain onset, and (2) that pain patients are a psychologically homogeneous group. Chronic pain sufferers in multiple settings and control subjects participated in this study in which the relationships between pain and 20 psychological variables were examined. Pain was defined and assessed in 3 different ways: (1) membership in a pain group, (2) number of specialists consulted for pain, and (3) pain intensity. Of the 20 psychological variables examined, only less emotional repression and greater "ergomania" (excessive work) were consistently associated with pain on all 3 pain criteria. In addition, pain patients were more likely to have had a relative with pain. Comparisons of pain patients in different settings showed that pain clinic patients reported having been more active throughout their lives, but were currently more depressed and experienced less life satisfaction than patients who were not in a specialized pain centre. These results are interpreted in the light of current multicausal views of pain and conclusions are drawn about the role of psychological variables both as risk factors in, and as consequences of pain. 
Cholestasis without cirrhosis alters regulatory liver gene expression and inhibits hepatic regeneration. Partial hepatectomy (PH) initiates cellular signals for regeneration. Sequential expression of nuclear and cytosolic protooncogenes accompanies the restoration of normal liver function and architecture. Although cirrhosis is known to inhibit liver regeneration, the effects of noncirrhotic cholestasis on hepatocellular proliferation, differentiation, and regulatory gene expression are unknown. To examine this, 25 male Fisher rats underwent common bile duct ligation and division. A 47% +/- 5% PH was performed 10 days after common bile duct ligation and division when histologic analysis revealed cholestasis without cirrhosis. Despite early elevations of total hepatic DNA and RNA values, cholestatic livers demonstrated a significant threefold suppression of expected hepatocyte mitotic indexes 48 and 72 hours after PH, compared with livers after PH alone. Weight restoration in cholestatic livers was 11% +/- 5.2% compared with 40% +/- 4.3% in control livers (+/- SEM; p less than 0.001) 5 days after PH. Analysis of regenerating liver messenger RNA with complementary DNA probes revealed an abnormal, sustained elevation of K-ras expression in cholestatic livers through all time points. Cholestasis blunted but did not obliterate normal sequential elevations in H-ras found in control livers. The expression of c-myc was inhibited threefold with cholestasis 72 hours after PH. These results are the first indication that cholestasis alone inhibits hepatocyte proliferation and the expression of c-myc that normally precedes the first wave of mitosis. This implies that cholestasis without cirrhosis may alter programmed liver gene expression, inhibiting normal hepatic regeneration. 
Cavernous malformations of the brain stem. Once they become symptomatic, cavernous malformations of the brain stem appear to cause progressive morbidity from repetitive hemorrhage, and can even be fatal. Twenty-four patients with long-tract and/or cranial nerve findings from their cavernous malformations of the brain stem were seen for initial evaluation or surgical consultation and thereafter received either surgical or continued conservative treatment. The decision to operate was based on the proximity of the cavernous malformation to the pial surface of the brain stem, the patient's neurological status, and the number of symptomatic episodes. Sixteen patients were treated by definitive surgery directed at excision of their malformation. In four patients, associated venous malformations influenced the surgical approach and their recognition avoided the risk of inappropriate excision of the venous malformation. Although some of the 16 patients had transient, immediate, postoperative worsening of their neurological deficits, the outcome of all except one was the same or improved. Only one patient developed recurrent symptoms: a new deficit 2 1/2 years after surgery required reoperation after regrowth of the cavernous malformation. She has been neurologically stable since the second surgery. One patient died 6 months postoperatively from a shunt infection and sepsis. The eight conservatively treated patients are followed with annual magnetic resonance imaging studies. One has a dramatic associated venous malformation. Seven patients have either minor intermittent or no symptoms, and the eighth died from a hemorrhage 1 year after his initial presentation. Based on these results, surgical extirpation of symptomatic cavernous malformations of the brain stem appears to be the treatment of choice when a patient is symptomatic, the lesion is located superficially, and an operative approach can spare eloquent tissue. When cavernous malformations of the brain stem are completely excised, cure appears permanent. 
Postoperative treatment of nonmetastatic visible residual neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study. The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) evaluated in a prospective study the hypothesis that patients who had localized, visible residual neuroblastoma without regional lymph node involvement after surgery (POG stage B) have a favorable prognosis when treated with moderate intensive chemotherapy. Eligible patients were initially treated with five courses of Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Evansville, IN) and Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) followed by surgery (CY/AD +/- surgery). Those patients not achieving a complete remission (CR) crossed over to five courses of cisplatin and teniposide (PL/VM) +/- surgery. Radiation therapy (XRT) was given to selected patients who still were not in CR after the crossover therapy. Of the 61 eligible patients, 38 (62%) patients achieved CR after CY/AD proven by clinical (31) or surgical (seven) evaluation. One (2%) patient in clinical partial remission (PR-C) entered CR without further therapy. Nineteen (31%) patients achieved CR with the following salvage therapies: surgery (five), PL/VM +/- surgery (five) followed by XRT (three) or autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) (one) and further courses of CY/AD +/- PL/VM instead of courses of PL/VM (five). The overall CR rate was 95% (58 of 61). Four patients had recurrence of the disease. The probability of being disease-free at 3 years after initial or salvage therapy was estimated at 84% (SE, 5%). The overall prognosis of children older than 1 year and younger than 1 year was similar (P = .26). If, however, the three remission deaths (all younger than 1 year) were censored, there was only one other failure in 32 children younger than one versus seven of 29 children older than 1 year (P = .018). These results confirm the excellent prognosis for patients with POG stage B neuroblastoma and indicate that most patients are curable with CY/AD +/- surgery, and those not achieving CR with this therapy are curable with alternate therapy. 
Effects of perindopril on left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary blood flow, and mechanical properties of cardiac muscle in renovascular hypertensive rats. We studied the effects of perindopril on left ventricular hypertrophy, systemic and coronary hemodynamics, and mechanical cardiac performance in renovascular hypertensive rats (Goldblatt, two-kidneys, one-clip). Systemic and coronary hemodynamics, before and after carbochrome infusion, were assessed by radioactive microspheres injection via an atrial catheter in conscious rats. Mechanical performance was measured on isolated papillary muscle from the same animal. Twelve treated hypertensive rats were compared with 10 nontreated hypertensive rats and nine sham-operated normotensive rats of the same age. Perindopril treatment induced a complete control of blood pressure (mean blood pressure from 156 +/- 22 mm Hg in the untreated group to 100 +/- 24 mm Hg in the treated group (P less than .01), compared to 106 +/- 18 mm Hg in the sham group). This was associated with a nearly complete regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass/body weight 2.26 +/- 0.38 mg/g in the treated group v 3.1 +/- 0.6 in the untreated group [P less than .01], compared to 2 +/- 0.25 mg/g in the sham group [p = NS]). Minimal left ventricular coronary resistances after carbochrome were slightly higher in the hypertensive group compared both to sham and treated group. A reversal of impaired myocardial mechanical parameters towards control values was observed, except for some parameters of relaxation. We conclude that perindopril allows in this model a complete control of blood pressure, and a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy with normalization of coronary hemodynamics and contractile function. 
Serum and tissue alpha-L-fucosidase activity in the pre-clinical and clinical stages of hepatocellular carcinoma. 1. To assess the value of serum alpha-L-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) as a marker for hepatocellular carcinoma, the activity was measured in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in control subjects. 2. Mean serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity was significantly greater in 35 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (225 +/- 69 nkat/l) than in 35 patients with cirrhosis and 20 normal subjects (134 +/- 30 and 93 +/- 28 nkat/l, respectively). The overlap between hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, however, was such as to severely limit any value of the enzyme as a diagnostic test. 3. In four cirrhotic patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, an increased enzyme activity was detectable in samples taken up to 66 months before the tumours were diagnosed clinically. 4. The serum activity of alpha-L-fucosidase fell to within the reference range after liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma in three patients and in one of these a subsequent rise was associated with tumour recurrence which was diagnosed at 8 months after the rise in activity. Ineffective cytotoxic chemotherapy was also associated with a progressive rise in serum alpha-L-fucosidase activity. 5. alpha-L-fucosidase activity in tumour tissue was significantly lower than that seen in non-tumour tissue from cirrhotic patients. These reductions may represent increased transport from the tissue and may partly account for the increased serum activity found in some patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. 
Clinical cardiac positron emission tomography: state of the art. Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) has evolved rapidly from a relatively esoteric research tool into clinical applications providing unique, quantitative information on myocardial perfusion, metabolism, and cell membrane function and having a potentially significant impact on cardiovascular medicine. Although there are many different positron radionuclides for imaging diverse myocardial behavior, three radionuclides have reached accepted clinical utility. Cardiac PET using nitrogen-13-ammonia, rubidium-82, and fluoro-18-deoxyglucose has proved accurate and definitive in multiple university and private-practice sites for diagnosing and assessing severity and location of coronary artery disease in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, for identifying injured but viable myocardium potentially salvageable by revascularization, and for ruling out clinically significant coronary artery stenosis with a high specificity in patients who might otherwise undergo coronary arteriography to document the absence of significant disease. 
Extracorporeal shock wave treatment of common bile duct stones: experience with two different lithotriptors at a single institution. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is a new treatment modality for retained common bile duct stones. Sixty-two patients (mean age 75 years, range 27-95 years) with retained common bile duct stones were treated with two different lithotriptors. One of the lithotriptors operated on the electrohydraulic principle (Dornier HM-3) (n = 13), the other on the electromagnetic principle (Siemens Lithostar) (n = 49). All HM-3 patients were treated under general anaesthesia, whereas with the Lithostar one patients was treated under general anaesthesia, 43 received analgesia and sedation and five had no analgesia at all. Patients treated with the Lithostar had more sessions (mean 1.9 versus 1.3, P less than 0.05) and needed more stock waves (mean 8611 versus 2534, P less than 0.001) than patients treated with the HM-3. Fragmentation was achieved in all patients treated with the HM-3 and in 42 (86 per cent) patients treated with the Lithostar. In this latter group ten patients underwent common bile duct exploration without complications. Eleven patients had transient haematuria after treatment with the HM-3 and two patients (one in each group) had a subcapsular haematoma of the right kidney, all without clinical sequelae. At follow-up (median: HM-3 43 months, Lithostar 18 months), none of the patients had biliary complaints. We conclude that ESWL of retained common bile duct stones in safe and effective with both lithotriptors and should be considered before surgery in the elderly or high-risk patient. 
Open biopsy without wound closure for skeletal neoplasms. During the past several years, the indications for limb salvage in musculoskeletal neoplasms have been expanded. As a result, interest in the topic of diagnostic biopsy has been renewed. Post biopsy hematoma formation and the iatrogenic spread of cancer cells has led to universally accepted guidelines for biopsy technique. These include meticulous hemostasis and wound closure. A technique of open biopsy without wound closure in which the biopsy site in a long bone with contained neoplasm remains open and hematoma allowed to drain into the dressings is outlined. A discussion of the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of this technique is presented. 
Restored hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction by peripheral chemoreceptor agonists in dogs. Hypoxic stimulation of the peripheral chemoreceptors inhibits hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV). On the other hand, almitrine, a peripheral chemoreceptor agonist, has been reported in some studies to enhance HPV. To further explore this apparent contradiction, we investigated the effects of two different low intravenous doses of almitrine on pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa) versus cardiac index (Q) plots in 32 pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs ventilated alternatively in hyperoxia (FIO2, 0.4) and in hypoxia (FIO2 0.1). HPV, defined as a hypoxia-induced increase in Ppa over the entire range of Q studied, from 2 to 5 L/min/m2, was elicited in 16 dogs. In the first eight of these "responders," almitrine 2 micrograms/kg/min had no vascular effect, and in the other eight, almitrine 4 micrograms/kg/min inhibited HPV. In 16 other dogs, hypoxia did not affect Ppa over the entire range of Q. In these "nonresponders," almitrine 2 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8) as well as 4 micrograms/kg/min (n = 8) restored HPV. To answer the question whether the ability to restore HPV would be specific to almitrine, we administered intravenously the structurally unrelated chemoreceptor agonist doxapram at the dose of 20 micrograms/kg/min to an additional group of eight "nonresponders," and this treatment also restored HPV. Intravenous infusion of the malic acid solution solvent of almitrine had no effect on Ppa/Q plots in a final group of eight "nonresponders". We conclude that low dose almitrine and doxapram restore HPV in dogs with a naturally absent hypoxic pulmonary pressor response, probably by a direct effect at the pulmonary vessels. 
Syncope and orthostatic hypotension. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the postural blood pressure response over time, the prevalence of orthostatic hypotension in patients with syncope, and the relationship of orthostatic hypotension to recurrence of symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We prospectively evaluated 223 patients with syncope in a standardized manner. Orthostatic responses were measured in a standardized fashion at 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 minutes or until symptoms occurred. Follow-up was obtained at 3-month intervals. Causes of syncope were assigned by predetermined criteria. RESULTS: Orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure decline) was found in 69 patients (31%). The median time to reach minimal standing systolic blood pressure was 1 minute for all subjects. In patients with orthostatic hypotension (20 mm Hg or greater), mean time to reach minimum blood pressure was 2.4 minutes. The vast majority of patients with significant orthostatic hypotension had this finding within 2 minutes of standing. Orthostatic hypotension was common in patients for whom other probable causes of syncope were assigned. The recurrence of syncope was not related to the degree of orthostatic hypotension; however, the recurrence of dizziness and syncope as end-points was lower in patients with 20 mm Hg or greater systolic blood pressure reductions as compared with patients with lesser degrees of orthostatic blood pressure declines. CONCLUSION: Orthostatic hypotension is common in patients with syncope and is detected in the vast majority of patients by 2 minutes. Although symptom recurrence on follow-up was lower in patients with more severe orthostatic hypotension, the clinical significance of this finding needs to be further defined by future studies. 
Clinical experience with the Palmaz-Schatz coronary stent. Complications that occurred in 247 patients who underwent successful elective stenting to native coronary arteries with the Palmaz-Schatz balloon expandable stent included subacute thrombosis in 7 patients (2.8%), myocardial infarction in 3 (1.2%), death 3 (1.2%), urgent bypass surgery in 4 (1.6%) and major bleeding events in 24 (9.7%). Angiographic restenosis occurred in 21 (20%) of 103 patients who received a single stent. Subgroup analysis, however, revealed that restenosis of a single stent occurred in 3 (7%) of 45 patients without prior angioplasty compared with 25 (27%) of 91 patients with prior angioplasty. Patients with "suboptimal" angioplasty results (dis-section) who received a single stent seemed to have a higher thrombosis rate perioperatively (4 [4%] of 98), but no higher incidence of restenosis (7 [15%] of 46) than that of the total group of patients who received a single stent. Coronary stenting may be a valuable adjunct to coronary angioplasty in carefully selected patients. Complication rates are similar to those of routine angioplasty; however, angiographic restenosis may be reduced in certain subsets of patients. 
No correlation between response and survival in patients with multiple myeloma treated with vincristine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone. A vincristine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (VMCP) multi-drug regimen was used in 85 previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma (MM) (symptomatic Durie Stages II and III) until they became refractory. The prognostic significance of various pretreatment characteristics was evaluated in terms of therapeutic response (according to Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] and Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force [TF] criteria) and survival. Therapeutic responses, obtained in 31.2% (SWOG) and 68.7% (TF) of patients, had a significant inverse correlation with myeloma cell mass, serum calcium, and bone status. Median survival time of Stage II and Stage III patients was 39 and 34 months, respectively. Serum B2 microglobulin greater than or equal to 6 micrograms/ml was the only variable correlating unfavorably with survival duration after multi-variate analysis (increased risk = 2.79), although therapeutic response as a time-dependent variable had no effect on survival. These data suggest no correlation between response and survival, partially because of inadequate response assessment criteria and partially because no existing treatment is curative (although current therapeutic approaches may prevent death from complications). 
Temperature-dependent modulation of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in cultured human astroglial cells by dexamethasone and indomethacin. In bacterial meningitis, LPS induces production in cerebrospinal fluid of the cytokines IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), which are the principle mediators of meningeal inflammation. IL-1 beta and TNF alpha induce fever, and elevated temperature may affect cytokine expression. Dexamethasone treatment improves outcome in bacterial meningitis possibly by inhibiting IL-1 beta and TNF alpha. In this report, the effects of elevated temperature and dexamethasone on LPS-stimulated IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA gene expression and protein synthesis were studied in human astrocytoma cell lines and primary cultures of human fetal astrocytes. Cells cultured at 40 degrees C exhibited smaller peaks of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha transcription and protein synthesis compared with cells cultured at 37 degrees C. The addition of dexamethasone before, during, or after exposure of the cells to LPS resulted in temperature-dependent inhibition of IL-1 beta transcription and protein synthesis. The most extensive inhibition occurred in pretreated cells cultured at 37 degrees C. Cotreatment with LPS and dexamethasone also inhibited TNF alpha mRNA transcription at both temperatures. The effects of another antiinflammatory agent, indomethacin, on LPS induction of IL-1 beta and TNF alpha mRNA were temperature and cell line dependent. These findings provide a possible explanation for the efficacy of dexamethasone treatment of bacterial meningitis and support the proposal that fever may be beneficial to the host in this disease. 
Prolonged lumbar spinal drainage after the resection of tumors of the skull base: a cautionary note. A combined transcranial and facial approach was used for an en bloc resection of a malignant angiosarcoma of the ethmoid sinuses. The patient awoke neurologically intact and was monitored in the Intensive Care Unit. A lumbar subarachnoid drain was placed for the continuous removal of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Approximately 36 hours after surgery, she deteriorated neurologically and demonstrated bilateral extensor posturing to painful stimuli. A computed tomographic scan demonstrated obliteration of the basal cisterns indicative of transtentorial herniation and a small amount of extradural air. Eight hours after the lumbar drain was turned off, the patient had recovered completely. We propose that the patient manifested transtentorial herniation caused by a pressure gradient between the supratentorial and lumbar cistern compartments brought on by the continuous removal of CSF from the lumbar subarachnoid space. We suggest that ventricular drainage should be considered for these cases rather than lumbar drainage. This offers the same advantage of removing the CSF and maintaining low-to-normal intracranial pressure without the risk of transtentorial herniation. 
Ridogrel in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty. The safety of the combination of heparin and ridogrel therapy and its antiplatelet efficacy was examined in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). In 32 patients without known aspirin intake for 10 days before PTCA, therapy with ridogrel (300-mg intravenous bolus) was begun just before PTCA and continued orally at a dose of 300 mg twice daily until discharge. Heparin was administered as a 10,000 IU bolus dose before PTCA and followed by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1,000 IU/hour for 24 hours. Bleeding problems at the arterial entry site occurred in 13 patients, which required a blood transfusion in only 2 patients. One patient underwent emergency bypass surgery without specific problems of hemostasis. Ridogrel virtually eliminated thromboxane B2 from the serum (29,990 +/- 6,555 pg/0.1 ml before vs 63 +/- 7 pg/0.1 ml at 2 hours after ridogrel), with a concomitant increase in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (511 +/- 34 pg/0.1 ml before vs 1,190 +/- 146 pg/0.1 ml at 24 hours after ridogrel). There were no acute reocclusions in the ridogrel-treated patients, whereas acute reocclusions occurred in 5.6% of the patients taking the standard aspirin + heparin regimen during the same period. Furthermore, at 6-month clinical follow-up patients treated with ridogrel compared favorably with those receiving standard treatment. 
A longitudinal investigation of the factor structure of subjective well-being: the case of the Philadelphia Geriatric Center Morale Scale. The purpose of this research was twofold: (a) to replicate the hierarchical factor structure of well-being with rural data; and (b) to investigate the longitudinal invariance of this factor structure. Subjective well-being was hypothesized to have a hierarchical factor structure with a second order factor, well-being, explaining variance in first order dimensions labeled agitation, lonely dissatisfaction, and attitude toward one's aging. The latent constructs were measured by items composing the PGC Scale (Lawton, 1975). Maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis techniques were used to test the fit of the model. Subjective well-being was investigated using a panel of older rural adults surviving a ten-year, two-wave investigation. Results of the study provided support for the hierarchical factor structure of well-being in cross-sectional analyses. This factor structure was varied across time, however. 
Implications of self-reported cognitive and motor dysfunction in HIV-positive patients. OBJECTIVE: The authors examined HIV-positive subjects to determine the relationship of patient complaints of cognitive and motor dysfunction to psychiatric status and performance on established cognitive and motor function tests. METHOD: HIV-positive volunteers (N = 77) were evaluated at entry into a longitudinal neurological study. Forty were asymptomatic, 29 had AIDS-related complex, and eight had AIDS. The subjects were not selected for the presence or absence of cognitive or motor complaints. Complaints of cognitive and motor dysfunction were assessed with items from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Macro Neurologic Exam. Current depression and anxiety were assessed with the Profile of Mood States. Psychiatric status was assessed with the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule, a structured interview that provides DSM-III psychiatric diagnoses. Actual cognitive and motor performance was measured with standard neuropsychological tests known to be sensitive to the effects of HIV. RESULTS: Cognitive complaints were found in 38 (49%) of the subjects. These complaints were associated with psychiatric symptoms but not with cognitive performance. Motor complaints, found in 12 (16%) of the subjects, were associated with poorer motor performance but not with psychiatric symptoms. The overall frequency of psychiatric diagnosis was high. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reports of cognitive and motor dysfunction were common in this unselected group and are of concern to health care providers. Potentially treatable psychiatric conditions were also common, particularly in subjects with cognitive complaints, and appropriate treatment referrals are indicated. Patients who report motor dysfunction should be neurologically evaluated for treatable causes. 
Standards for selected anthropometric measurements in Prader-Willi syndrome. We report standards (95th, 50th, and 5th centiles) in Prader-Willi syndrome for weight, height, sitting height, head circumference, head length, head breadth, hand length, middle finger length, palm length, hand breadth, foot length, foot breadth, triceps skinfold, and subscapular skinfold. For comparison with Prader-Willi syndrome standardized curves, normal control data from the literature were plotted similarly and standard curves were produced. We encourage the use of these standards with the examination of patients who have Prader-Willi syndrome and in the comparison of the patient who has Prader-Willi syndrome with other similarly affected individuals. The standards may also be useful for assisting in the diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome, particularly in younger individuals. 
Differential response of malignant human B-cells to anti-IgM immunoglobulin (anti-mu) and B-cell growth factor: unique direct cytotoxicity of anti-mu on prolymphocytic leukemia cells. We examined in vitro tritiated thymidine uptake by B cells from seven prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), seven chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and four plasma cell leukemia (PCL) patients in response to culture with anti-human IgM antibody (anti-mu) and B-cell growth factor (BCGF). In contrast to the stimulatory effect observed in normal B-cell cultures, the divalent F(ab')2 anti-mu antibody uniquely inhibited the autonomous proliferation and induced marked cytotoxicity in six of seven PLL cell cultures independent of complement or Fc-receptor-mediated mechanisms. There was neither stimulation or inhibition of the slgM+ CLL or the slgM- PCL cells. The inhibitory effect on the PLL cells was observed at an anti-mu concentration below the stimulatory threshold for normal B cells. Significant impairment of trypan blue exclusion was delayed until 48 hours, with morphological cellular changes suggestive of a programmed cell death mechanism or apoptosis. The cytotoxicity was independent of the slgM-staining intensity or the autonomous and BCGF-augmented DNA synthetic activity of the PLL cells and was similar in patients with de novo PLL or with prolymphocytic transformation of CLL. Cells from a PLL patient were separated by elutriation into two fractions, a BCGF-unresponsive large "transformed" cell fraction with marked autonomous DNA synthesis and a smaller lymphoid cell subset with low 3H-thymidine uptake that could be augmented by BCGF. Both fractions were equally susceptible to the cytotoxic effect of anti-mu. These data suggest that certain slgM-bearing malignant B cells are susceptible to anti-mu-triggered cytotoxicity. They may represent the malignant counterpart of a "tolerogenic" normal B-cell subset, and the unique direct cytotoxicity of anti-mu may provide a therapeutic strategy specifically for PLL. 
Endoscopic contact Nd:YAG laser resectional vaporization (ECLRV) and esophageal dilatation (ED) in advanced malignant obstruction of the esophagus. Malignant esophageal obstruction in patients with advanced and metastatic carcinoma is unsuitable for surgery. Palliative treatment must provide adequate swallowing with minimum complications in these often seriously ill patients. Twenty consecutive patients underwent endoscopic Nd:YAG contact laser resection and vaporization (ECLRV) and esophageal dilatation (ED) for advanced esophageal carcinoma since August, 1985. Average duration of the disease when first referred was 7.2 months. Tumor cell type was either squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11) or adenocarcinoma (n = 9). Tumor location was distal (n = 14), middle (n = 5), or upper (n = 2). Mean tumor length was 7.5 cm. Mean preoperative luminal diameter was 1 mm, with total obstruction in ten (50%) patients. The operative procedure in all patients was under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation. Rigid and flexible endoscopes were both used as indicated. Mean postoperative luminal diameter was 15 mm. All but four were able to swallow fluids on the first postoperative day, followed by semisolids the next day without discomfort. Minor perforation was noted in three cases and managed in two conservatively. One more patient had difficulty in swallowing due to extra-esophageal compression, in spite of a technically successful laser therapy. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was carried out in eight cases. Eleven patients were retreated successfully for recurrent obstruction and two were treated more than twice, at a mean of six-week intervals. Endoscopic contact laser resectional vaporization with esophageal dilatation was relatively safe and provided an improved quality of life in this preliminary study group, providing a mean survival of 18.5 weeks (range 2-50 weeks). 
Primary intrasellar coccidioidomycosis simulating a pituitary adenoma. The case of a 68-year-old woman who had relatively acute, unilateral ophthalmoplegia is reported. Radiological studies indicated a mass lesion involving the pituitary gland and left cavernous sinus. Pathological tissue obtained by the transsphenoidal approach revealed the presence of a Coccidioides granuloma. This pathological entity should be considered when evaluating patients with a pituitary mass and ophthalmoplegia. 
Mediastinal involvement by alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma: evaluation with computerized tomography. We have reported a case of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with mediastinal involvement occurring in a 15-year-old boy. Computerized tomography revealed an anterior mediastinal mass with internal mammary nodal involvement, which had metastasized from a tumor of the abdominal wall musculature. When making the differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass with concurrent distant soft tissue and muscle involvement in an adolescent, rhabdomyosarcoma should be considered. 
Clomipramine for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder affects about 2 percent of the U.S. population and can be quite disabling. Clomipramine is the only drug approved for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Its efficacy is unique among tricyclic antidepressants and may be related to its relatively high potency in affecting serotonergic neurotransmission. The drug has many anticholinergic effects, but it is relatively well tolerated by the patients for whom it is effective. A 0.4 percent incidence of seizures, a potentially serious side effect, has been observed. Other antidepressants that are relatively selective for serotonergic (as opposed to noradrenergic) transmission may be as effective as clomipramine in the treatment of this disorder; controlled studies are under way. Clomipramine at low doses is also effective in the treatment of panic disorder and has been used successfully in the treatment of premature ejaculation. 
Concurrent double balloon valvotomy for combined rheumatic mitral and tricuspid stenosis. We expanded the application of percutaneous balloon valvotomy (PBV) to 4 adults (age 14 to 30 years, average 22.2 years) with combined rheumatic mitral and tricuspid stenosis. Double balloon dilatation reduced the transmitral gradient from 17.36 +/- 3.54 to 5.52 +/- 0.89 (P less than 0.025) and transtricuspid gradient from 12.65 +/- 2.67 to 3.67 +/- 0.95 (P less than 0.025). Mitral and tricuspid valve area increased from 0.73 +/- 0.20 to 2.57 +/- 0.67 (P less than 0.005) and from 0.77 +/- 0.24 to 2.67 +/- 0.24 cm2 (P less than 0.005), respectively. The procedures were well tolerated, with no significant increase in valvular regurgitation or left to right shunt across the atrial septum. The excellent symptomatic and haemodynamic benefits are sustained at 3-24 months follow-up. It is concluded that combined dilatation of stenotic valves by double balloon technique can emerge as an alternative to surgery in selected patients with polyvalvar rheumatic heart disease. 
Detecting arrhythmia by exercise electrocardiography in pediatric patients: assessment of sensitivity and influence on clinical management. We studied 49 patients with suspected arrhythmias (group 1) and 92 patients with previously documented arrhythmias (group 2) who underwent exercise electrocardiography (EECG) at our institution between 1979 and 1987. Among group 1 patients, all of whom had sinus rhythm before exercise, 10 (20%) had abnormal findings on EECG, and treatment was modified in 4 of these 10 (8% of group 1). Further testing (24-hour ambulatory or transtelephonic electrocardiographic monitoring or electrophysiologic study) of the 39 patients with normal EECG findings revealed 8 additional patients with arrhythmias. In group 1, the sensitivity of EECG was 56%, and its negative predictive value was 79%. Group 2 consisted of 38 patients with atrial arrhythmias, 31 with ventricular arrhythmias, and 23 with atrioventricular conduction abnormalities before EECG. Of these 92 patients, 68 (74%) had abnormal EECG findings. All but 1 of the 24 patients with normal findings underwent further testing, and rhythm abnormalities were induced in 16. Patients with atrial arrhythmias were more likely to have normal EECG results (42%) than were those with ventricular arrhythmias (23%) or an atrioventricular conduction abnormality (4%). Of the 35 patients who had been referred for suppression of an arrhythmia, 25 (71%) had abnormal rhythm suppressed during exercise. Clinical management was modified in 27% of group 2 patients on the basis of EECG findings. 
Parathyroid adenoma manifested as pancreatitis and polyuria. Although the data used to explain a relationship between hyperparathyroidism and pancreatitis remain incomplete, there does appear to be a relationship between the two. We believe our patient's clinical course strongly supports this. 
Postexercise hypotension is not sustained in normal and hypertensive humans. Blood pressure falls after a single session of exercise. The duration for which this fall in blood pressure persists is not known. Sustained hypotension after a single session of exercise may have important implications in the treatment of patients with mild hypertension. We studied 24 subjects (12 normotensive subjects and 12 patients with mild or borderline hypertension). Blood pressure was measured in the laboratory for 30 minutes before and for an hour after graded bicycle exercise to maximal voluntary capacity. Subjects then left the hospital and measured their blood pressures at home (three measurements every 2 hours) following a strict measurement protocol for the rest of the day (usually between 8 and 12 hours). These home blood pressure measurements were compared with home blood pressure measurements recorded at the same times on a nonexercise control day. At 30 minutes after the graded maximal exercise test, the hypertensive patients experienced a fall in blood pressure from 142 +/- 3.5/93 +/- 6.5 mm Hg (mean +/- SEM) to 124 +/- 4.5/79 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). For the normotensive subjects, blood pressure after exercise fell from 117 +/- 3.1/70 +/- 2.1 mm Hg to 109 +/- 3.1/62 +/- 2.8 mm Hg (p less than 0.01). Despite these striking blood pressure reductions for the second half hour after exercise, blood pressure measurements recorded at home were not significantly different on the exercise and control days in either group. We conclude that although a single bout of exercise lowers blood pressure for a short (1-hour) period, this hypotension is not sustained. 
Residual functional deficit after partial fibulectomy for bone graft. The residual functional deficit caused by partial fibulectomy for bone graft was documented with subjective assessment and clinical and instrumented examination in ten patients. The donor leg often remained mildly symptomatic. Residual weakness occurred when the middle one third of the fibula was excised. However, mild discomfort, residual weakness, and laxity were not considered significant enough to discourage transplantation of large segments of the fibula. Postoperative therapy should emphasize muscular strength to minimize the functional deficit. 
Case-control study of screening for prostatic cancer by digital rectal examinations. Although commonly thought to be an effective method of screening for prostatic cancer, digital rectal examinations have yet to be shown by controlled study to help prevent advanced forms of this disease. 139 men with metastatic (stage D) prostatic cancer (cases) were compared with an equal number of matched men free of this condition (controls), with respect to rectal examinations recorded in the medical records up to, on average, 23 years before the cases' initial diagnosis of prostatic cancer. Cases and controls were members of a large health maintenance organisation in northern California. In the 10 years before initial diagnosis (excluding the last three months) the average number of examinations for routine screening (2.45 vs 2.52) or to evaluate intestinal or rectal symptoms (0.44 in both) were similar in cases and controls, respectively. After adjustment for racial differences, the relative risk of metastatic prostatic cancer for men with one or more screening rectal examinations compared with men with none was 0.9 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.5-1.7. Screening by routine digital rectal examination appears to have little if any effect in preventing metastatic prostatic cancer. If there is a small benefit, it will be difficult to demonstrate by conventional epidemiological study. 
Measuring physical activity with a single question. Using 1,004 subjects enrolled in a worksite health promotion program, this report evaluated the validity of a single question about participation in regular exercise. Measured at baseline, this one question had a significant age-adjusted association with body mass index (p less than 0.0001 in women and p = 0.001 in men), HDL cholesterol (p less than 0.0001 in women), and oxygen capacity (p = 0.0007 in women and p = 0.002 in men). Thus, one self-reported question can provide useful information about who is and who is not participating in regular exercise. The potential validity of a single exercise question is particularly relevant in complex epidemiologic studies where lengthy questionnaires highlight the importance of brief instruments. 
Endoscopic removal of gastric lipoma: diagnostic value of endoscopic ultrasonography. A 47-yr-old male with gastric lipoma is presented. X-ray and endoscopic examinations revealed a submucosal tumor on the posterior wall of the gastric antrum. Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated the hyperechoic mass in the submucosa without continuity to the muscularis propria, by which the lesion was diagnosed as lipoma. The lesion was successfully removed by endoscopic polypectomy without complications. The cross-sections of the removed specimens were quite consistent with the ultrasonographic findings. Endoscopic ultrasonography is valuable in assessing the exact extent of the tumor and in determining whether or not endoscopic polypectomy is called for. 
Characterization of Bay U 3405, a novel thromboxane A2/endoperoxide receptor antagonist. The thromboxane A2-receptor antagonistic properties of Bay U 3405 [(3R)-3-(4-fluorophenylsulfonamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-9-carbaz o-lepropanoic acid] have been evaluated in various pharmacologic models. Bay U 3405 specifically inhibits platelet aggregation induced by U 46619, collagen, platelet-activating factor, and the second wave of ADP (IC50 0.5, 0.07, 0.3, 0.19 microM) in human plasma. The plasma phase of ADP-induced aggregation is not affected. U 46619-induced platelet aggregation is competitively antagonized (pA2 = 6.3). In humans, ex vivo platelet aggregation is inhibited after oral application of 2 or 50 mg Bay U 3405. Bay U 3405 also specifically and competitively antagonizes U 46619-induced contractions of rabbit aortic rings (pA2 = 7.4). In vivo, Bay U 3405 protects rabbits dose dependently from arachidonic acid or collagen-induced thromboembolism (ED50 1-3 mg/kg p.o). Chronic administration of Bay U 3405 to stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats reduces stroke-related mortality and diminishes the occurrence of cerebral hemorrhages. From these results, we conclude that Bay U 3405 is an orally active, selective, and competitive thromboxane A2-receptor antagonist that may be beneficial in the treatment of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases. 
Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of pancreatic duct stones. Chronic calcifying pancreatitis presents a major clinical problem, often requiring extensive surgery. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) offers a new therapeutic option. We applied ESWL after endoscopic sphincterotomy of the pancreatic orifice in eight patients with impacted pancreatic duct stones. An electromagnetic lithotriptor (Siemens Lithostar, Erlangen, FRG) was used. Patients were treated in prone position under fluoroscopic control. A mean of 6,813 shock waves (range 1,500-10,000) was delivered in one or two sessions. Disintegration of stones was achieved in 6/8 patients, initial relief of pain in 7/8 patients, and total clearance of the pancreatic duct in 3/8 patients. One patient had an exacerbation of her pancreatitis one day after ESWL, which resolved rapidly with medical treatment. No other complications were observed. Four of five patients with fragmented stones had no abdominal complaints at follow-up (mean 17 months, range 3-27). Three patients in whom ESWL was not completely successful (two without and one with partial fragmentation) underwent an operation according to Puestow. Two of them still have abdominal complaints after surgery. From these data, we conclude that ESWL of pancreatic duct stones is a promising new alternative for surgery, when endoscopic stone extraction fails. 
Post-traumatic cholesteatoma. Post-traumatic cholesteatoma often presents many years after the original injury. This case occurred 24 years after a head injury which represents the longest recorded interval. A further interesting feature was that the patient presented with an infected skull prosthesis that was inserted at the time of the original injury. 
Primary prevention of sudden cardiovascular death in hypertensive patients. Mortality results from the MAPHY Study. In a randomized primary prevention trial including 3,234 men with mild to moderate uncomplicated hypertension, the effect of the beta-blocker metoprolol or a thiazide diuretic as an initial antihypertensive therapy was compared regarding the risk of sudden cardiovascular death during a follow-up ranging from 2.3 to 10.8 years (median of 4.2 years). Only men aged 40 to 64 years were included in the study. The randomization of patients into the metoprolol (n = 1,609) or diuretic group (n = 1,625) was performed after stratification for age, smoking habits, serum cholesterol, and systolic blood pressure. At baseline the two treatment groups were well matched. Metoprolol was given in a mean dose of 174 mg daily and the mean dose of thiazide diuretic was either 46 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily or 4.4 mg bendroflumethiazide daily. Identical blood pressure control was achieved using the fixed therapeutic schedule. Total and cardiovascular mortality were significantly lower for metoprolol than for diuretics, owing to fewer deaths from coronary heart disease and stroke. Of the cardiovascular deaths, 78% were classified as sudden cardiovascular deaths (occurred within 24 h after the onset of symptoms). There were significantly fewer sudden cardiovascular deaths in the metoprolol group compared to the diuretic group (32 v 45, P = .017). The present results suggest that initial antihypertensive therapy with metoprolol is associated with a lesser incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths than initial diuretic treatment in uncomplicated hypertension. 
An evaluation of clinical variables in determining the need for pelvic examination in the emergency department. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of multiple clinical variables to predict an increased or decreased probability of pelvic pathology, therefore determining when a pelvic examination is needed. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: An urban emergency department. TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: 246 female patients presenting with abdominal pain and undergoing pelvic examination. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 99 patients without pelvic pathology (40%) and group 2 consisted of 147 patients with pelvic pathology (60%). Pelvic pathology was defined as presence of infective discharge (with confirmation on wet mount/potassium hydroxide smear), presence of adnexal mass and/or tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, uterine enlargement and/or tenderness, blood in the vaginal vault, and culture report positive for Neisseria gonorrhea. The following variables achieved statistical significance (P less than .05) using a logistic regression model: history of vaginal discharge (odds ratio, 2.30 [95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 4.32]); history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia (4.35 [1.52 to 12.40]); right upper quadrant pain on physical examination (0.33 [0.13 to 0.85]); and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination or history (1.73 [0.94 to 3.19]). CONCLUSION: History of vaginal discharge, history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia, and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination act as risk variables predicting presence of pelvic disease. Right upper quadrant pain on physical examination acts as a protective variable to predict absence of pelvic disease. This information may aid the emergency physician in determining the need for a pelvic examination in women with abdominal pain. 
Screening of diabetic children for coeliac disease with antigliadin antibodies and HLA typing. IgA and IgG antigliadin antibodies were measured in 498 patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and no history of intestinal malabsorption. Thirty patients had abnormal concentrations of antigliadin antibodies; 22 of these had an intestinal biopsy carried out and 16 of the 22 had subtotal villous atrophy suggestive of coeliac disease (prevalence 3.2%). There were no significant differences between patients with coeliac disease and diabetes and diabetic patients with normal IgA antigliadin antibodies in any of the nutritional variables measured, duration of diabetes, and mean insulin requirement. The mean age of onset of diabetes and attainment of expected height for age were both significantly lower in the patients with both diseases. Typing HLA classes I and II was done in 242 patients. The incidence of HLA-B8, DR3, and DQW2, which are commonly associated with both the diseases, is increased when both are present. 
Acute diverticulitis. A complicated problem in the immunocompromised patient. We reviewed the records of 209 patients with acute diverticulitis treated from 1984 through 1989 to determine if immunocompromised patients have a worse prognosis than nonimmunocompromised patients. Forty immunocompromised patients and 169 nonimmunocompromised patients with acute diverticulitis were identified. Free perforation into the peritoneal cavity occurred in 43% (17/40) of immunocompromised patients and 14% (24/169) of nonimmunocompromised patients. Operations were performed in 58% (23/40) of immunocompromised patients and 33% (55/169) of nonimmunocompromised patients. Postoperative morbidity was 65% (15/23) in immunocompromised patients and 24% (13/55) in nonimmunocompromised patients; postoperative mortality was 39% (9/23) and 2% (1/55), respectively. We conclude that acute diverticulitis in the immunocompromised patient is a complicated problem; there is a greater risk of free perforation and need for surgery than in the nonimmunocompromised patient. Furthermore, the prognosis for immunocompromised patients who undergo surgery is worse than that for nonimmunocompromised patients. 
Does the addition of methylene blue to the sclerosant improve the accuracy of injections during variceal sclerotherapy? We evaluated the possibility that the addition of methylene blue to the sclerosant would improve the accuracy of intravariceal injections during endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy. Four patients had eight sessions of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy with a sclerosant containing a combination of 3% sodium tetradecyl and 60% renograffin. For four sessions, 1 ml of methylene blue was added to 9 ml of sclerosant. The endoscopist judged each injection to be intravariceal or paravariceal. This was confirmed by fluoroscopy. There were 57 injections (28 with methylene blue, 29 without) in the eight sclerotherapy sessions. Intravariceal injections were confirmed fluoroscopically in 64.9% of injections (60.7% with methylene blue 69% without). The endoscopist correctly assessed intravariceal versus paravariceal injections 66.7% of the time (71.4% with methylene blue, 62% without). None of the differences approached statistical significance. The addition of methylene blue to the sclerosant does not improve the accuracy of intravariceal injections or the endoscopist's ability to recognize paravariceal injections during sclerotherapy of esophageal varices. 
Propranolol therapy alters estimation of potential cardiovascular risk derived from submaximal postinfarction exercise testing. We studied the effect of propranolol administration on risk assessment based on submaximal exercise testing performed early after myocardial infarction. A total of 70 patients with recent infarction underwent modified Bruce treadmill testing with simultaneous measurement of expired gases in the absence of antianginal agents including beta-antagonists. Among these, 31 patients who had at least one of the following abnormalities--ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm (22 patients), chest pain (four patients), or treadmill time less than 360 seconds (12 patients)--were studied in a randomized double-blind fashion and received either placebo or 240 mg of propranolol/day. A total of 28 patients completed the randomized phase and were able to undergo repeat exercise testing an average of 3.4 +/- 1.8 days later. Randomized groups were equivalent at baseline except for a higher peak oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production (p less than 0.05) in the propranolol compared with the placebo group; these differences were taken into account in statistical analyses of the study data. Resting heart rate (59 +/- 1.2 versus 82 +/- 4.2 beats/min) and peak heart rate x systolic blood pressure (14,208 +/- 496 versus 20,075 +/- 1,062) were both significantly less (p less than 0.01) after propranolol than after placebo. Eight of nine patients treated with placebo maintained ST depression greater than or equal to 1 mm from the initial to the randomized exercise test, compared with only 4 of 13 receiving propranolol (p less than 0.01). In those with continued ST depression, time to positivity was significantly longer in those receiving propranolol compared with those taking placebo (538 +/- 73 versus 318 +/- 44 seconds, p less than 0.05). In contrast, the peak ratio between carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption was higher in those receiving propranolol compared with those receiving placebo (0.93 +/- 0.04 versus 0.81 +/- 0.03, p less than 0.05). We conclude that propranolol therapy reduces evidence of ischemia and changes traditional estimates of potential cardiac risk derived from submaximal postinfarction exercise testing. 
Modifications of thermoregulation in patients with suprasellar pituitary adenomas. Thermoregulation was investigated pre and postoperatively in 5 and only preoperatively in 7 patients with suprasellar pituitary adenomas by exposing them to external cold and heat in a climatic chamber. Five healthy subjects served as controls. Body core and skin temperatures, oxygen consumption, electromyographic activity, skin blood flow and local sweating rates were continuously measured. Threshold temperatures for activation of heat production and heat loss were calculated from these data. Hormone analysis was performed before and after stimulation with releasing factors. In the patients, core temperatures as well as threshold temperatures for heat production and heat loss were elevated by about 0.5 degrees C as compared with controls. This elevation of core and threshold temperatures was achieved, despite a reduced resting metabolic rate, by a reduction of skin blood flow indicated by a low mean skin temperature. After successful operation the thermoregulatory alterations normalized. Serum levels of growth hormone were reduced preoperatively and stimulation by GHRF did not cause an appropriate increase. Prolactin was elevated in 6 patients with prolactinomas, but there was no correlation with changes in thermoregulatory threshold temperatures. Stimulation of the other hypophyseal hormones by the combined anterior pituitary function test revealed a normal hormonal response. Apart from prolactin there were no significant hormonal changes postoperatively. It is concluded that disturbances of temperature regulation are present in patients with suprasellar adenomas, but that they are not detectable by routine clinical methods. These alterations probably depend on a disturbance of hypothalamic function and are reversible by surgery. 
Spinal cord trauma in man: studies of phosphorylated neurofilament and ubiquitin expression. Changes in neuronal proteins are a major feature of the neurodegenerative disorders, but the biological significance of these changes is not understood. We describe alterations in neuronal proteins as a result of surgical tractotomy on the human spinal cord at 3, 5, 7, 14 and 72 days after operation. Antibodies to phosphorylated neurofilaments labelled neuronal cell bodies in the nucleus dorsalis and anterior horns. Axonal swellings showed positive staining for ubiquitin, but ubiquitinated neuronal inclusions were not evident. The presence of phosphorylated neurofilaments in the neuronal cell bodies and of ubiquitination of axonal swellings may be indicators of interrupted axonal transport. The changes found in intracellular proteins in neurons after trauma do not resemble those found in motor neuron disease, suggesting that the intraneuronal ubiquitinated inclusions may have a unique significance in the cytopathology of that disorder. 
ATP-regulated K+ channels protect the myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion damage. The role of ATP-regulated K+ channels in protecting the myocardium against ischemia/reperfusion damage was explored using glibenclamide and pinacidil to block and activate the channels, respectively. Electrical and mechanical activity of arterially perfused guinea pig right ventricular walls was recorded simultaneously via an intracellular microelectrode and a force transducer. The preparations were subjected to either 1) 20 minutes of no-flow ischemia with or without glibenclamide (1 and 10 microM) followed by reperfusion, or 2) 30 minutes of no-flow ischemia with or without pinacidil (1 and 10 microM) followed by reperfusion. No-flow ischemia for 20 minutes produced changes in electrical and mechanical activity that were completely reversed on reperfusion; resting membrane potential declined by 13 +/- 1.2 mV, action potential duration at 90% repolarization (APD90) decreased by 62%, and developed tension fell by greater than 95%, but resting tension did not change significantly. Glibenclamide (10 microM) had no effect on activity during normal perfusion, but during ischemia, resting membrane potential fell slightly further (17 +/- 1.8 mV) and APD90 declined by only 24%. Developed tension declined more slowly and to a lesser extent, but resting tension rose significantly between 10 and 20 minutes of ischemia. Reperfusion of glibenclamide-treated tissues elicited arrhythmias (extrasystoles and tachycardia), and the preparations failed to recover mechanical function. Glibenclamide at 1 microM produced qualitatively similar effects, albeit less severe. After 30 minutes of no-flow ischemia in untreated tissues, resting tension increased by approximately 130% during the no-flow period. Reperfusion caused arrhythmias (extrasystoles, tachyarrhythmias, and fibrillation) and failed to restore resting or developed tension to preischemic levels. Pinacidil at 1 microM did not affect electrical or contractile function, but at 10 microM it had a negative inotropic effect, decreasing APD90 and developed tension by 5% and 18%, respectively. Both concentrations of the drug caused a faster and greater decline in APD90 during the no-flow period. Resting tension did not change during 30 minutes of no-flow ischemia in the presence of pinacidil, and reperfusion led to 85% and complete recovery of electrical and mechanical activity at 1 and 10 microM, respectively. The data indicate that glibenclamide enhances whereas pinacidil reduces myocardial damage caused by ischemia/reperfusion. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of ATP-regulated K+ channels during ischemia is an important adaptive mechanism for protecting the myocardium when blood flow to the tissue is compromised. 
Islet amyloid polypeptide in proliferating pancreatic B cells during development, hyperplasia, and neoplasia in humans and mice. The occurrence of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) immunoreactivity was investigated in fetal pancreas, islet cell hyperplasia, and tumors in humans and mice. Transgenic mice heritably developing endocrine tumors of the pancreas (AVP/SV40, Rip 1 Tag2/Rip2PyST1 and Glu2-Tag strains) were used as murine models of islet cells proliferative disease. In the mouse, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in B cells at embryonic day 12 (E12), paralleling the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In hyperplastic/dysplastic islets and in B-cell tumors of transgenic mice (n = 16), IAPP immunoreactivity was localized consistently to insulin-immunoreactive cells. Ultrastructural single- and double-immunogold labeling of transgenic mice B-cell tumors (n = 3) showed insulin and IAPP to be colocalized in beta granules. In human fetuses, IAPP immunoreactivity was found in insulin-immunoreactive B cells, but at a later gestational age than the onset of insulin immunoreactivity. In pancreatic specimens of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (11 cases) and in pancreatic endocrine tumors (21 cases, 10 of which were functioning insulinomas), IAPP immunoreactivity was found consistently in insulin-immunoreactive B cells. Congo-red-positive amyloid deposits present in tumors also were IAPP immunoreactive. Ultrastructural single and double immunogold labeling of infantile/neonatal persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia cases (n = 3) and functioning insulinomas (n = 2) showed IAPP and insulin to be colocalized in beta granules. In addition, IAPP immunoreactivity was observed in amyloidlike fibrils. These findings indicate that IAPP is a constitutive component of B cells. Possible relationships between IAPP and insulin expression and interspecies differences are suggested and discussed. 
Effects of atriopeptidase inhibitor UK 79300 on left ventricular hydraulic load in patients with congestive heart failure. We investigated effects of the first orally active atriopeptidase inhibitor UK 79300 (Pfizer Clinical Research, UK) on left ventricular hydraulic load in patients with congestive heart failure NYHA II and III. In our study, 6 patients received 200 mg and 4 patients received 400 mg of UK 79300, and 4 patients received placebo (controls). Before and 90 min after oral administration of UK 79300 or placebo aortic input impedance was assessed to characterize left ventricular hydraulic load. Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) significantly increased by 126% after 200 mg and by 141% after 400 mg of UK 79300, but remained unchanged in control patients. Mean arterial pressure and flow, resistive term, characteristic impedance and oscillatory aortic input pressure power showed minor changes without statistical significance on an intergroup comparison. We conclude that acute atriopeptidase inhibition by UK 79300 effectively increases endogenous ANP levels up to 2.5-fold. However, these changes were not accompanied by significant effects on left ventricular hydraulic load. 
Weekly low-dose methotrexate therapy for cutaneous sarcoidosis. Three patients with severe, treatment-resistant cutaneous sarcoidosis were treated with low-dose oral methotrexate on a weekly basis. Facial granulomas and ulcerations responded best. A response was apparent after several weeks of treatment, but 6 to 9 months were required to reach maximal effect. 
Transurethral resection of prostatic abscess under sonographic guidance. Transrectal ultrasound may establish the diagnosis of prostatic abscess in an ambiguous clinical setting. Transurethral resection (deroofing) is the treatment preferred by many clinicians, yet intraoperative complete abscess obliteration may be difficult to confirm endoscopically. We report on a patient with a complex prostatic abscess endoscopically resected under transrectal ultrasound guidance. Adequacy of treatment was proved pathologically. 
Nucleotide deletion resulting in frameshift as a possible cause of complete thyroxine-binding globulin deficiency in six Japanese families. Complete T4-binding globulin deficiency (TBG-CD) is inherited in an X-linked fashion. A nucleotide substitution has been shown to cause this hereditary condition in caucasians of French Canadian origin. Heterogeneity in molecular mechanisms for TBG-CD has also been reported. Genomic DNA from a Japanese male exhibiting TBG-CD was subjected to polymerase chain reaction, and the generated DNA fragments were sequenced. A single nucleotide deletion was found in the first base of the codon for amino acid 352 of the common-type TBG molecule. This mutation causes a frameshift in translation and premature termination. Compared with common-type TBG, the mutated polypeptide results in 1) 22 different amino acids on its carboxy-terminus, 2) a 22-amino acid truncation, and 3) the absence of a potential N-linked glycosylation site. These alterations may lead to profound changes in the secondary and tertiary structures of the molecule. To ascertain the presence of this nucleotide deletion in the genomic DNA of affected subjects, a mutated primer was designed which together with the nucleotide deletion produced a new endonuclease restriction site in the polymerase chain reaction fragment. Results revealed the presence of the mutation in genomic DNA of the subject, and his mother was shown to have both mutant and normal alleles. The same mutation was also detected in five other unrelated families carrying TBG-CD. This mutation may be frequent in Japanese subjects with TBG-CD. 
Spectrum of intestinal failure in a specialised unit. 300 consecutive admissions over 7 years to a purpose-built intestinal failure unit are reviewed. The commonest underlying condition was Crohn's disease (42%), and the commonest complication precipitating admission was intestinal fistula (42%). Total parenteral nutrition was used in 85% and surgery in 50%. A multidisciplinary approach to management gave a high success rate--90% of patients were discharged from hospital, although nearly 25% needed home parental nutrition. These results suggest that chronic intestinal failure should be managed in specialised units in the same manner as other types of organ failure. 
Efficacy of ketanserin in the therapy of Raynaud's phenomenon: thermometric data. After a two-week washout (WO) period with placebo 1 capsule/bid, 12 patients suffering from stable Raynaud's phenomenon were treated with ketanserin (K) 40 mg/bid for fifteen days. Blood pressure, heart rate, and laboratory parameters were evaluated at the end of each period. Patients used diary cards to record the number, duration, and intensity of attacks. Computerized thermometry of the fingers was evaluated at basal temperature after acclimatization, 23 degrees C for thirty minutes; after cold test, 10 degrees C for five minutes; and after thermal recovery, 23 degrees C for eighteen minutes. Results were analyzed statistically by use of Student's t-test for paired data (p less than 0.05). No marked changes were observed in the symptoms of the attacks, but K proved effective in significantly reducing the number and duration of daily attacks and in promoting their spontaneous regression. Thermometry revealed a parallel increase in temperatures, particularly basal and recovery values. The data suggest increased flow and decreased vasospasm following 5-HT2 receptor blockade. 
Chronic periaortitis presenting as common bile duct obstruction. The case of a 67 year old woman is reported who presented with cholestatic jaundice and was found to have, in addition, an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. Only at necropsy did histopathology show chronic periaortitis as the aetiology of a pancreatic head mass which, during life, mimicked a pancreatic neoplasm obstructing the bile and pancreatic ducts. 
Synchronous hippocampal bursting reveals network excitability defects in an epilepsy gene mutation. A mutation at the tottering locus (tg, recessive, on chromosome 8) stimulates noradrenergic locus coeruleus axon terminal outgrowth and predisposes the brain to generalized spike-wave epilepsy in the young mouse. In an isolated synaptic circuit studied in vitro, the hyperinnervated mutant hippocampal pyramidal neurons respond normally when individually activated; however, latent neuronal signaling defects emerge during synchronous network bursting, revealing two conditional excitability phenotypes: a voltage-dependent prolongation of a complex synaptic response, the paroxysmal depolarizing shift, and a beta-adrenoreceptor-linked attenuation of the afterhyperpolarization. In this target brain region, the tg locus transforms neuronal excitability without altering measured intrinsic membrane properties, indicating that gene control of inherited epileptic traits may be mediated in part by activity-dependent modulation of network behavior favoring synchronous neuronal firing. 
The coronary artery response to implantation of a balloon-expandable flexible stent in the aspirin- and non-aspirin-treated swine model. Intracoronary stents may potentially alleviate some of the problems associated with coronary angioplasty. Since the anatomy and physiology of swine coronary arteries closely resemble those of humans, the response to implantation of the Glanturco-Roubin, balloon-expandable, flexible stent was studied in this model. Additionally, the effect of aspirin, 1 mg/kg/day orally, on this response was evaluated. Eighteen Hanford minature swine underwent stenting of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Two died within 24 hours of stent implantation. The 16 survivors were put to death at 4 (n = 4), 11 (n = 4), 28 (n = 4), 56 (n = 3), and 180 (n = 1) days. Angiographically, reduction of stent lumen diameter of 0.1 to 1.3 mm was observed and was maximum at 11 days, with gradual improvement at subsequent time periods. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and light microscopy showed early disruption of subjacent endothelium, and adherence of platelets to exposed subendothelium and stent wires. Microthrombi were readily apparent. At 11 days, intimal thickening, made up predominantly of smooth muscle cells with abundant extracellular matrix, was observed and covered the stent wires. At 28 days, regression of intimal thickening was apparent and a confluent endothelium with flow-directed orientation was seen. At 56 and 180 days, the luminal surface was smooth; intimal thickening averaged 525 microns over the stent wires and 55 microns away from the wires. Findings in aspirin-treated animals were similar to results in those that did not receive aspirin. Thus in this swine model, stent implantation results in a time-dependent and self-limited vascular response. 
Eccrine acrospiroma (clear cell hidradenoma) of the eyelid. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features. A 46-year-old man underwent excision of a left lower eyelid mass that had enlarged over a 2-month period. Pathologic examination showed the mass to be an eccrine acrospiroma, a benign adnexal tumor that rarely arises in the eyelid. Light microscopic and ultrastructural examination showed two types of cells to comprise the tumor: eosinophilic cells with intracytoplasmic tonofilaments, and clear cells with intracytoplasmic glycogen granules. Immunohistochemical stains were positive for cytokeratins AE 1,3, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, and muscle specific actin in tumor cells. 
Diuretic agents versus beta-blockers. Comparison of effects on mortality, stroke, and coronary events. Three recently concluded large randomized clinical trials have compared the preventive effects of diuretic agents and beta-blockers in the treatment of approximately 22,000 subjects with hypertension. In the Medical Research Council trial, bendrofluazide (10 mg daily) was compared with a dose of propranolol (as much as 240 mg daily), a nonselective beta-blocker without intrinsic sympathomimetic activity. Two selective beta-blockers, atenolol (100 mg daily) and metoprolol (200 mg daily), were compared with bendrofluazide (5-10 mg daily) and hydrochlorothiazide (50-100 mg daily) in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension trial. In the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension, 160 mg of slow-release oxprenolol, a beta-blocker with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity, was compared with a diuretic-based regimen not containing beta-blockers. In each trial, similar reductions in mean diastolic blood pressure were achieved with diuretic and beta-blocker treatment that lasted for several years. All-cause mortality and fatal and nonfatal stroke and coronary event rates were also similar in the treatment groups. Thus, it appears that beta-blockers are as effective as diuretic agents in improving survival and in preventing major morbid events. Regarding cigarette smoking and stroke incidence, observations based on post hoc subgroup analyses of the Medical Research Council trial were not supported by subgroup findings in the Heart Attack Primary Prevention in Hypertension and the International Prospective Primary Prevention Study in Hypertension trials, and these observations should not form the basis for any treatment recommendations. 
The paradox of 'chronic unstable angina' secondary to an organizing intracoronary thrombus [published erratum appears in South Med J 1991 Sep;84(9):1074, 1160] We have described a case in which coronary vasospasm and the resultant endothelial shear stresses most likely caused plaque rupture and transient coronary occlusion at the site of a minor atherosclerotic narrowing. Remodeling then led to a long, complex stenotic lesion that included ruptured and dissected endothelium and organized thrombus. This led to severe anginal symptoms over a 3-month period, or the paradox of "chronic unstable angina." Angioplasty was difficult but eventually successful after pulsed high-pressure balloon inflations and intracoronary thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase. This case demonstrates that the clinical course of a patient with minor or insignificant coronary disease may be a dynamic process that cannot be entirely predicted even by recent invasive cardiac studies. 
Altered excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptor binding in hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. We examined binding to excitatory amino acid and inhibitory amino acid receptors in frozen hippocampal sections prepared from surgical specimens resected from 8 individuals with medically refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. The excitatory receptors studied included N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), strychnine-insensitive glycine, phencyclidine, and quisqualate. The inhibitory receptors studied were gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) and benzodiazepine. Excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptor binding were differentially altered in the patients with temporal lobe epilepsy in comparison to 8 age-comparable autopsy control subjects, and changes in receptor binding were regionally selective in four areas. Binding to phencyclidine receptors associated with the NMDA channel was reduced by 35 to 70% in all regions in the hippocampi of the patients. In contrast, binding to the NMDA recognition site and its associated glycine modulatory site was elevated by 20 to 110% in the cornu ammonis (CA) 1 area and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus of the patients. Binding to these sites was unaffected in area CA4. Binding to the quisqualate-type excitatory amino acid receptor was unchanged in all regions except the stratum lacunosum moleculare CA1, where it was increased by 63%. GABAA and benzodiazepine receptor binding was reduced by 20 to 60% in CA1 and CA4, but unchanged in dentate gyrus. The data indicate that excitatory and inhibitory amino acid receptors are altered in the hippocampus of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. 
Isolation, physicochemical characterization and preclinical efficacy evaluation of soluble scleroglucan. Herein we describe the isolation, physicochemical characterization and preclinical evaluation of a water-soluble biologic response modifier extracted from Sclerotium glucanicum. Alkaline extraction of insoluble S. glucanicum exopolymers produced a soluble scleroglucan composed of a triple-helical beta-1,3-linked glucopyranose backbone with single beta-1,6-linked glucopyranosyl branches every third subunit. Scleroglucan has a weight average molecular mass of 1.56 x 10(6) Da, a weight average root mean square distance from the center of gravity of the molecule to its farthest elements of 51.8 nm, a polydispersity (weight-average molecular mass/number average molecular mass) of 1.83 and intrinsic viscosity of 3.081 dl/g. Scleroglucan (250 mg/kg, intravenously) stimulated in vivo murine macrophage phagocytic activity (66%, P less than .001) and increased in vitro macrophage tumor cytotoxicity against syngeneic tumor targets by 124% (P less than .05). Scleroglucan enhanced (P less than .001) murine bone marrow proliferation in a biphasic manner by up to 328%. Scleroglucan therapy increased survival of mice challenged with syngeneic lymphoma, melanoma or adenocarcinoma. AKR/J mice bearing syngeneic lymphoma (1 x 10(3) cells, intraperitoneally) demonstrated increased (P less than .001) long-term survival (100% vs. 0%, greater than 64 days). C57Bl/6J mice bearing syngeneic melanoma B16 (5 x 10(5) cells, subcutaneously) demonstrated increased long-term survival (64% vs. 0%, P less than .05). C57Bl/6J mice bearing syngeneic adenocarcinoma BW10232 (1 x 10(5) cells, subcutaneously) demonstrated increased (P less than .05) median survival time. In addition, scleroglucan prophylaxis increased resistance of mice to challenge with Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and mouse hepatitis virus A-59. Scleroglucan did not induce toxicity or hepatomegaly. We conclude that: 1) a branched, water-soluble beta-1,3-linked scleroglucan biologic response modifier can be extracted from S. glucanicum; 2) scleroglucan will stimulate immunity, modify experimental neoplastic disease and increase resistance to microbial challenge; and 3) scleroglucan shows promise as an immunopotentiating drug. 
Hypertrophic smooth muscle in the partially obstructed opossum esophagus. Excitability and electrophysiological properties. Partial obstruction of the opossum esophagus leads to thickening of the circular muscle, hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells, and diminution of the extracellular space. The pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of this hypertrophied muscle were studied. Carbachol produced phasic and tonic contractions of the circular muscle. The EC50 for tonic contractions was greater for hypertrophied than for normal muscle (21.1 +/- 3.9 mumol/L vs. 4.8 +/- 2.2 mumol/L; P less than 0.05). The resting membrane potential difference of hypertrophied muscle (-50.8 +/- 0.2 mV) was similar to that of normal muscle (-50.0 +/- 0.2 mV). Electrical stimulation of intrinsic nerves in the normal muscle produced a hyperpolarization followed by a depolarization of smooth muscle membrane potential. Hypertrophied muscle responded either with an attenuated hyperpolarization or no hyperpolarization, both of which were followed by a depolarization. The space constant in the long axes of the hypertrophied circular muscle cells was greater than normal (4.4 +/- 0.2 mm vs. 3.4 +/- 0.1 mm; P less than 0.001). The threshold potential for initiation of action potentials was more negative for hypertrophied (-43.2 +/- 0.4 mV) than for normal circular muscle (-41.6 +/- 0.2 mV; P less than 0.005). These data indicate that alterations in neuromuscular function accompany the hypertrophy of esophageal smooth muscle. 
Socioeconomic status and visual impairment among urban Americans. Baltimore Eye Survey Research Group. The Baltimore Eye Survey is a population-based study of ocular disorders conducted in East Baltimore, Md, designed to determine the prevalence and severity of vision loss and ocular disease and their relationships to socioeconomic and other risk factors. This survey comprised 5300 subjects (2911 whites and 2389 blacks). Visual impairment was associated with age, race, general health status, educational level, income, and employment status. An identified association of race with blindness and visual impairment was reduced, but not eliminated, after adjustment for these socioeconomic factors, indicating that socioeconomic status itself is an important determinant of visual impairment. 
Choledocholithiasis in cirrhotic patients: is endoscopic sphincterotomy the safest choice? Of the 18 endoscopic sphincterotomies performed on 18 cirrhotic patients for choledocholithiasis, a mortality rate of 16.6% was registered. However, this figure can be limited to 6.6% if we take only successful sphincterotomies (15/18, 83.3%) into account. After closely reviewing relevant literature, it would appear that operative mortality in comparable cases is much higher. We therefore recommend that endoscopic sphincterotomy, despite higher mortality rates when compared to the general population, should be the initial choice of management of choledocholithiasis in cirrhotic patients. 
The coexistence of tics and dystonia. We studied nine patients with motor and phonic tics and other features of Tourette's syndrome, who developed persistent dystonia in addition to their tics. All, except one, were males (mean age, 35.8 years; range, 8 to 59 years), and had onset of tics prior to age 18 years (mean age, 9 years; range, 1.5 to 17 years). None of the patients were treated with neuroleptic drugs prior to the onset of dystonia. Torticollis and blepharospasm were the most common forms of dystonia. Seven patients had a history of tics in first degree relatives. While these patients were seen in a specialized movement disorder clinic and may, therefore, represent a population with atypical and more severe symptoms, the high prevalence rate of dystonia (5.0% of all patients with Tourette's syndrome seen in the clinic) suggests that some patients with tics may have an increased risk for dystonia. 
Morbidity and mortality after coronary artery bypass in octogenarians. One hundred fifty seven consecutive octogenarians (mean age +/- standard deviation, 82.4 +/- 1.9 years) underwent coronary artery bypass grafting with hypothermia (mean temperature, 21.8 degrees +/- 1.8 degrees C), hyperkalemic cardioplegia, and cardiopulmonary bypass in a 9-year period. Sixty-six percent were male. Preoperatively, 115 patients (73%) were in New York Heart Association functional class IV, with the remainder being in either class III (23%) or class II (4%). Twenty percent of the patients had major complications including postoperative hemorrhage (15), sepsis (9), cerebrovascular accident (6), third-degree heart block (5), renal failure requiring dialysis (1), and pulmonary embolism (1). The 30-day or in-hospital mortality rate was 7.0%. Mean total hospital stay was 26.1 +/- 17.9 days. One-year and 5-year actuarial survival rates were 85% and 62%, respectively. Higher mortality was seen to be associated with New York Heart Association class IV, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 0.40, and lesser values for cardiac output and cardiac index. At the 6-month postoperative follow-up, 73% of the survivors reported that their general health had improved as compared with before operation. This experience demonstrates that for select octogenarians with unmanageable angina pectoris, coronary artery bypass grafting is an effective therapeutic option. 
Congestive heart failure. New frontiers. Congestive heart failure is a common syndrome with high mortality in its advanced stages. Current therapy includes the use of vasodilator drugs, which have been shown to prolong life. Despite current therapy, mortality remains high in patients with severe heart failure. Potent new inotropic vasodilators have improved ventricular performance but have not prolonged life in patients with end-stage heart failure. Serious arrhythmias are implicated in the sudden deaths of 30% to 40% of patients with severe heart failure, but the benefits of antiarrhythmic therapy have not been established. Upcoming trials will address this question. Ventricular remodeling and progressive dilatation after myocardial infarction commonly lead to congestive heart failure; early unloading of the ventricle with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor may attenuate these events. These findings support the concept that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors may be useful in managing heart failure of all degrees of severity, including left ventricular dysfunction and end-stage heart failure. Part of the damage that may occur with acute myocardial infarction, particularly in this era of thrombolysis therapy, is reperfusion injury, which may be mediated by oxygen-derived free radicals. Better knowledge of the mechanisms and treatment of myocardial infarction, the leading cause of congestive heart failure, may help prevent or attenuate the development of this syndrome. 
Appendectomy during pregnancy: a Swedish registry study of 778 cases. Data from three Swedish health care registries--the Medical Birth Registry, the Registry of Congenital Malformations, and the Hospital Discharge Registry--were linked for the 9-year period 1973-1981 to identify women who had appendectomy during pregnancy and their offspring, and to determine several pregnancy outcomes (gestational duration, birth weight, perinatal mortality, and congenital anomalies). Among the 720,000 deliveries during this period, 778 were complicated by appendectomy (one in 936), and the diagnosis of appendicitis was confirmed in 64% of the cases (one in 1440). Significant findings included: 1) an increase in the risk of delivery the week after appendectomy when the operation was performed after 23 weeks' gestation, with no further increase if the pregnancy continued beyond 1 week; 2) a decrease in mean birth weight of 78 +/- 24 g with more infants than expected weighing less than 3000 g; 3) an increase in the number of live-born infants dying within 7 days of birth; 4) no increase in the number of stillborn infants; and 5) no increase in the number of congenitally malformed infants. 
Babesiosis. Diagnostic pitfalls. A case of babesiosis complicated by quinine-induced hemolysis is described. A splenectomized woman contracted babesiosis after visiting an endemic area. The patient presented with high fevers and minimal hemolysis. While she was on treatment, the hemolysis increased. The increased hemolysis was initially attributed to babesiosis, but after additional evaluation quinine therapy was found to be the cause. In the setting of this brisk hemolysis, there was an increase in red blood cell inclusions. At first, the inclusions were thought to be Babesia, but iron stain demonstrated that many of the inclusions were hemolysis-induced Pappenheimer bodies. The role of the clinical laboratory in sorting out this confusing picture is presented. 
The effect of interleukin-1 on adhesion formation in the rat. The potential role of interleukin-1 in postoperative adhesion formation was examined. Cecal abrasion gave a consistently higher adhesion score when compared with sham laparotomy, on the basis of adhesion number, density, and vascularity, and so was chosen for use in further studies. The extent of serosal bleeding during cecal abrasion did not affect adhesion scores. Intraperitoneal injection of 10 micrograms murine recombinant interleukin-1 alpha in cecally abraded animals on the day of surgery and on the following 4 days resulted in a significant increase in adhesion scores when compared with those of cecally abraded animals injected with vehicle alone. Adhesions enhanced with murine recombinant interleukin-1 alpha, which were thicker and more vascular, were equivalently enhanced at doses from 10 to 10,000 ng, implying maximal response over that range. Rats not operated on and receiving recombinant interleukin-1 alpha 2 weeks after injury had increased adhesion formation. These results demonstrate that interleukin-1 alpha may be an important short-term mediator of postsurgical adhesion formation. 
Patterns of failure in Hancock pericardial bioprostheses. A series of Hancock pericardial valve bioprostheses was reviewed for cases of primary valve failure. Thirteen mitral and 10 aortic valve explants were recovered from 21 adult patients. Mitral valves had been in place for a mean of 56.4 months, and aortic valves for 53.8 months. All valves failed with cusp tears from stents (with a mean of 1.7 for mitral valves and 2.6 for aortic valves) in a predictable pattern, suggesting that wear and stress at cusp stitch sites are important in their pathogenesis. The topography of these tears is illustrated as are the less common associates of primary failure, such as calcification, fibrosis, and thrombosis. Similarities and differences of this valve's failure compared with that of the Ionescu-Shiley pericardial valve are discussed. 
Carotid endarterectomy in elderly patients Between 1971 and 1989, 749 carotid endarterectomies were performed at our institution for symptomatic carotid occlusive disease in patients older than 70 years of age. Of these procedures, 693 were done in patients 71 through 80 years of age, and 56 were done in patients between the ages of 81 and 90 years. The neurologic morbidity and perioperative mortality in the former group were 2.9% and 1.4%, respectively, whereas in the latter group the corresponding values were 5.4% and 0%, respectively. For the entire group, the neurologic morbidity was 3.1% and the mortality was 1.3%. Of the 23 new postoperative neurologic deficits, 19 (83%) occurred in high-risk patients with severe preoperative neurologic or medical risks, and 14 (61%) of these deficits were minor. In selected elderly patients with symptomatic hemodynamically significant carotid occlusive disease, endarterectomy seems to be a safe procedure that is associated with acceptably low perioperative morbidity and mortality. 
Cost analysis of microsurgical reconstruction in the head and neck. In a cost-conscious environment, pressure exists to justify the use of expensive techniques such as reconstructive microsurgery in head and neck patients. Therefore, the costs and effectiveness of 39 consecutive free tissue transfers in patients with head and neck defects due to neoplasia (77%), trauma (13%), or congenital causes (10%) were assessed by reviewing clinical and billing records. The technical success rate was 95% with a 29% rate of complications. Most patients returned to preoperative levels of social activities, and none admitted dissatisfaction with their results. Average cost was $27,000 per case with 16 days of hospitalization. Average cost for aerodigestive tract tumors was $37,400 with 21 days of hospitalization. Costs were directly related to the etiology of the defect and incidence of complications. Applying cost-effectiveness principles we believe that these costs are justified by the high level of patient satisfaction and enhanced quality of life. 
Mitral valve replacement six years after cardiac transplantation. A 33-year-old man found to have increasing mitral regurgitation and decreasing exercise tolerance 6 years after cardiac transplantation received a mitral bioprosthesis. For 8 months he has been without complications from the valve replacement and is clinically and hemodynamically considerably improved. 
Cerebral Doppler studies in the fetus and newborn infant. The goal of developing reliable commercial Doppler systems for measuring vessel diameter and velocity changes during the cardiac cycle appears to be near. Reaching this goal would enable us to obtain volume-flow information continuously. In animal experiments, continuous measurements of Doppler velocity, pressure, and flow add important insights into hemodynamic measurements. Incorporating Doppler methods in microcirculatory research could also provide a link between the microcirculatory and the macrocirculatory hemodynamic research. Although Doppler methods have been validated, Doppler findings in clinical research (using commercial systems) must be considered at best to reflect qualitative circulatory alterations indicating directions of change. Because of inherent technologic limitations and considerable intersubject and intrasubject variability, direct extrapolation of the numeric findings from one study to the other can lead to misleading conclusions. The Doppler results are also influenced by measurement conditions and equipment settings. However, Doppler-derived information can be used as an adjunct to clinical management in many of the diseases discussed above. As with any physiologic variable, serial measurements probably are of greater value than single measurements. With continued improvement in technology, Doppler methods hold promise of becoming an important adjunct in cerebral hemodynamic monitoring in perinatal-neonatal intensive care units. 
US-guided transvaginal drainage of pelvic abscesses and fluid collections. Ultrasound (US)-guided transvaginal needle or catheter drainage was performed in 14 women for a variety of pelvic abscesses and fluid collections; tubo-ovarian abscesses and postoperative collections were most common. Diagnosis was achieved in all 14 patients (100%), including one patient with suspected ovarian carcinoma who underwent only diagnostic needle aspiration and no therapeutic drainage. Abscesses or fluid collections were evacuated in 13 of 13 patients (100%) with either needle (n = 7) or catheter (n = 6) drainage (with appropriate antibiotics). Twelve of the 14 patients (86%) were spared an operation; surgery was undertaken in two patients for a persistent tubo-ovarian phlegmon. No major complications were associated with drainage. Catheters were removed an average of 6.7 days after insertion. The success, safety, and advantages of US-guided transvaginal drainage in our early experience suggest its use as an alternative to standard percutaneous catheter procedures to diagnose and drain certain pelvic abscesses and fluid collections. 
Ventricular arrhythmias during treatment with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) in suspected acute myocardial infarction. Continuous electrocardiography during the first 24 hours of a stay in a coronary care unit was used to record ventricular arrhythmias during treatment with alteplase (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator) or placebo. Recordings were made on 378 of the 436 patients admitted to a double blind trial of alteplase or placebo in one participating centre of the Anglo-Scandinavian study of early thrombosis (ASSET), patients being selected according to the availability of recorders. Of these, 309 (158 given alteplase and 151 placebo) had greater than 5 hours of analysable data. Most of the arrhythmias were recorded in patients with an in hospital diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Ventricular couplets and ventricular tachycardia were significantly more common in the patients treated with alteplase. Further, in patients with myocardial infarction who had ventricular extrasystoles, couplets, or ventricular tachycardia type a, the number of hours in which each arrhythmia was recorded was significantly higher in the alteplase group. The various ventricular arrhythmias in the alteplase group tended to cluster in the first 4-12 hours of the recordings. During the first 24 hours admission there were four episodes of ventricular fibrillation in the alteplase group and five in the placebo group of taped patients. By one month there had been 18 deaths in these 309 patients (alteplase four, placebo 14). These bore no relation to any recorded arrhythmia. Clinical records for the patients with no or minimal tape data yielded six further episodes of ventricular fibrillation during the first 24 hours (three in the alteplase group and three in the placebo group). 
Quantitation of vascular outflow by measurement of impedance. One of the most important determinants of graft patency is the degree and character of vascular outflow. This study was designed to evaluate input impedance as a functional assessment of the outflow bed of vascular grafts. Four distinct outflow environments were created for external jugular vein conduits in 42 New Zealand white rabbits. Vein grafts (n = 14) were fashioned as end-to-side common carotid interposition bypass grafts. Arteriovenous fistulas (n = 15) were created by side-to-side anastomosis of the distal common carotid artery and linguofacial vein. Arteriovenous fistulas with outflow obstruction (n = 7) were fistulas with a metal clip partially obstructing the distal outflow channel (1 mm lumen). Vein graft/arteriovenous fistula combinations (n = 6) consisted of a vein graft and arteriovenous fistula in series. Pressure and flow in the external jugular vein were measured, and input impedance spectra were calculated by Fourier methods. By use of a PC-based acquisition and processing system, impedance results for 20 cardiac cycles could be obtained in approximately 10 minutes. The results revealed that vein grafts typically demonstrated high resistance to steady state flow (Rin = 235 +/- 50 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5) and steadily decreasing impedance to pulsatile flow resulting in a characteristic impedance (Z0; average of fourth to tenth harmonics) of 35.5 +/- 8.0 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5. Phase angle values were usually negative, especially at low harmonics (first harmonic phase angle = -1.11 +/- 0.10 radians) indicating that flow led pressure. In contrast, arteriovenous fistula Rin was minimal (6.3 +/- 1.4 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to vein graft, and the impedance was flat across the frequency spectrum (Z0 = 8.5 +/- 1.5 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5; p less than 0.05) with pressure and flow nearly in phase (first harmonic phase angle = -0.05 +/- 0.10 radians). Creation of outflow obstruction in arteriovenous fistulas resulted in significantly elevated Rin (136 +/- 41 x 10(3) dyne/sec . cm-5; p less than 0.05 compared to arteriovenous fistula and Z0 (23 +/- 9 x 10(3) dyne . sec/cm-5, p less than 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Gliofibroma. Case report. The case history of an infant with a large gliofibroma is presented. Gliofibromas are rare mixed glialmesenchymal tumors that have been poorly characterized. The computerized tomography appearance and a detailed light and electron microscopic description are presented, along with immunoperoxidase studies of this tumor. This case is compared with gliofibromas described elsewhere in the literature. 
Paget's disease of the nipple. A total of 48 women with Paget's disease of the nipple (nipple eczema containing Paget cells but without a palpable lump) presented to one surgeon over a 13-year period. Temporary healing of the nipple eczema occurred in six patients. In all, 21 of 34 patients with in situ (DCIS) or invasive ductal carcinoma had mammographic abnormalities. Treatment was by simple mastectomy (37 cases), cone excision of the nipple-areola complex (ten cases) and tamoxifen (one case). DCIS was found in 45 operative specimens (96 per cent); eight had associated invasion. The DCIS was predominantly large cell solid/comedo in type and was multifocal in seven cases (19 per cent). At a median (range) follow-up of 56 (18-96) months, four of the ten patients treated by cone excision have developed a local recurrence, two of these patients have also developed metastases. Two of the 37 patients who underwent mastectomy developed loco-regional recurrences; both had invasive foci at their first operation and remain disease free at 8 years. We no longer feel that cone excision is appropriate treatment. 
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding due to superior mesenteric artery to duodenum fistula: rare complication of metastatic lung carcinoma. Although metastases from primary carcinoma of the lung to the small intestine appear to be more common than previously suspected, they rarely produce symptoms. Such metastases may present as bowel perforations. Overt gastrointestinal bleeding has been described only as a prelude to perforation. We describe the case of a 55-yr-old man with carcinoma of the lung that had metastasized to the brain and to the third part of the duodenum. The duodenal metastasis presented with massive upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The metastasis was seen to be actively bleeding at endoscopy, and a direct fistula from a branch of the superior mesenteric artery to the third part of the duodenum was shown angiographically. Arterial invasion and destruction by tumor was confirmed at postmortem examination. This complication of metastatic carcinoma of the lung has not been previously described in the English literature. 
Regulation of jun-B expression by a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent mechanism in human myeloid cells. The present studies have examined the regulation of the jun-B early response gene by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways. The 2.0-kb jun-B transcript was at low but detectable levels in uninduced human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. In contrast, treatment with 1 mmol/L8-bromo-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase, was associated with increases in jun-B transcripts that were maximal by 1 hour and then decreased to near pretreatment levels by 6 hours. Similar findings were obtained with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP) and N6,2'-0-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dBt-cAMP). jun-B transcripts were also increased with other agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and forskolin. Moreover, inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by the isoquinolinesulfonamide H-8 blocked 8-Br-cAMP-induced increases in jun-B expression. The results of nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that treatment of HL-60 cells with PGE2, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, and dBt-cAMP is associated with increases in the rate of jun-B transcription. The present findings also demonstrate that the related jun-D gene is similarly regulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is involved in the induction of jun gene expression in myeloid leukemia cells. 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Proposed guidelines for monitoring toxicity. The most common toxicities of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are gastropathy, renal dysfunction, and liver function abnormalities. We outline an approach to monitoring patients on long-term NSAID therapy, focusing on the early detection of complications. Gastropathy caused by NSAID use is more common in elderly patients or those with a history of dyspepsia, peptic ulcer disease, or alcohol abuse. Fecal occult blood testing and hemograms are less accurate in detecting gastropathy than direct visualization but are convenient and relatively inexpensive. We recommend the periodic use of these tests to detect NSAID-induced acute or chronic blood loss. Renal toxicity is seen in patients with preexisting renal disease or functional volume depletion and in the elderly. Complications include renal insufficiency, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, and protein-uria. Renal function should be monitored during the first few weeks of NSAID therapy, especially in high-risk patients, with periodic testing thereafter. Hepatic toxicity is less common but warrants occasional determinations of alanine aminotransferase levels. Elderly patients and those with renal insufficiency or alcohol abuse have a higher risk of complications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be used cautiously in those patients at high risk for complications. Strategies can be used to limit toxicity. Patients taking these drugs long term should be monitored periodically for signs of blood loss, renal dysfunction, and hepatic dysfunction. 
Renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement. Renal cell carcinoma extends into the lumen of the inferior vena cava in approximately 4% of patients at the time of diagnosis. Surgical removal of the intracaval tumor thrombus with radical nephrectomy is the preferred treatment for this malignancy. From January 1977 to June 1990, 31 such patients were examined for combined problems of renal carcinoma and intracaval tumor extension. Twenty-six of these patients underwent radical nephrectomy and vena caval thrombectomy. Ten patients had tumor thrombus confined to the infrahepatic vena cava, 11 had retrohepatic caval involvement, and 5 had extension to the level of the diaphragm or into the right atrium. Surgical approach was dictated by the level of caval involvement. Control of the suprahepatic vena cava plus temporary occlusion of hepatic arterial and portal venous inflow were necessary in some cases; cardiopulmonary bypass was required for transatrial removal of more extensive tumors. Five of the 26 patients had evidence before operation of distant metastatic disease; none of these survived beyond 12 months. The 5-year actuarial survival rate of the 21 patients without known preoperative metastatic disease was 57%. Complete surgical excision of all gross tumor appears to be critical for long-term survival in these patients. 
Endocrine response determines the clinical outcome of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction in different ovulatory disorders. To accrue systematic information in different ovulatory disorders on the precise relationship among endocrine response, clinical outcome, and the occurrence of complications, we treated 114 patients with pulsatile GnRH (2.5-5.0 micrograms, iv, every 60 min) for 187 cycles and compared them to 20 normal menstrual cycles. Thirty of these patients had primary hypogonadotropic amenorrhea (PHA; 40 cycles), 33 had other forms of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH; 55 cycles), and 51 had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS; 92 cycles). Daily blood samples were drawn for hormone determinations. In PCOS, 50 cycles were preceded by GnRH analog suppression. PHA treatment cycles were characterized by the reestablishment of a normal endocrine pattern, almost no dose-related endocrine differences, elevated ovulatory (93%) and conception rates (23%), and no multiple pregnancies. In the HH subjects the ovulatory (91%) and pregnancy rates (31%) were high; however, while the lower GnRH dose elicited a normal endocrine pattern, the 5-micrograms dose induced excessive folliculogenesis and high estradiol levels and was associated with most of the multiple pregnancies of this study (three of four). GnRH analog suppression was successfully used to avoid recurrence of ovarian over-stimulation in two HH subjects. Finally, GnRH analog suppression in PCOS permitted normalization of the follicular phase endocrine pattern, achievement of good ovulatory (76%) and pregnancy (28%) rates, and avoidance of multiple pregnancies; however, luteal phase steroid secretion was abnormal, and the abortion rate remained elevated (43%). Obesity was associated with a reduced ovulatory rate in PCOS, but not in hypogonadotropic, subjects. Thus, we can conclude that in pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction: 1) a profound hypogonadotropic condition, whether spontaneous as in PHA or induced with GnRH analogs as in other ovulatory disorders, is associated with optimal menstrual cycle restoration, high ovulatory and conception rates, and virtually absent risks of multiple pregnancy; 2) residual hypothalamic activity in HH may be responsible for supraphysiological pituitary-ovarian stimulation and result in multiple pregnancy unless a low GnRH dose (2.5 micrograms/bolus) or GnRH analog pretreatment is employed; 3) obesity does not affect treatment outcome in hypogonadotropic patients; and 4) the high spontaneous abortion rate in PCOS may be related to corpus luteum dysfunction. 
Decreasing survival benefit from cardiac transplantation for outpatients as the waiting list lengthens. Many patients are accepted for cardiac transplantation during a period of clinical instability associated with a high risk of death, even though most can be discharged home to await transplantation. As the waiting lists lengthen, priority is awarded solely on the basis of the waiting time of outpatients, who now usually undergo transplantation after they have already survived a major period of jeopardy. To determine the impact of the current waiting times and priority system on the previously expected benefit offered by transplantation, 1-year actuarial survival without transplantation was recalculated after each month without transplantation for 214 potential candidates with an ejection fraction of 0.17 +/- 0.05 discharged on tailored medical therapy after evaluation. These data were compared with the 1-year survival data of 88 outpatients who underwent transplantation. Actuarial survival after 1 year was 67% on tailored therapy compared with 88% after transplantation (p = 0.009). Death without transplantation was sudden in 43 of 51 patients, resulting from hemodynamic decompensation in 8. For outpatients already surviving 6 months without transplantation, actuarial survival over the next 12 months was 83% without transplantation. Thus, the expected improvement in survival after transplantation would be only 5% over the subsequent year for patients waiting 6 months, which is the waiting time for many outpatients. Such patients should be reevaluated to determine whether transplantation remains indicated during the next year. 
Immunohistochemical detection of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in fibrotic liver diseases. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 was localized by means of immunohistochemical reaction in liver biopsy specimens taken from patients having different chronic liver diseases with extending fibrosis. Two polyclonal antibodies that were produced in rabbits were directed against the amino terminal of transforming growth factor-beta 1. Staining by anti-CC(1-30) was primarily extracellular and located in the portal and periportal fibrotic areas of all seven cases with chronic active hepatitis. No staining was noted in the four chronic persistent cases studied. A strong reaction was seen with the antibody in nine of the ten cirrhotic samples, whereas it was negative in one inactive cirrhosis case and in all five cases with normal liver histological findings. No positive staining could be detected by the anti-LC(1-30) in any of the liver tissues. Detection of transforming growth factor-beta 1 in active liver diseases at the site of fibrosis suggests that transforming growth factor-beta 1 might have a role in the process and progression of fibrosis during the development of the disease. 
DNA ploidy and cell kinetic measurements as predictors of recurrence and survival in stages B2 and C colorectal adenocarcinoma. DNA content and cell proliferation were measured by flow cytometry on paraffin-embedded Stage B2 or C colorectal adenocarcinomas from 694 patients enrolled in adjuvant trials conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. Patients with diploid tumors had a higher survival rate than those with nondiploid tumors (P less than 0.001). The proliferation index (the sum of the percent of cells in S-phase plus those in G2M phase) was also a strong prognostic factor (P less than 0.001). The ploidy and proliferation data were combined, and the patients in the favorable group (diploid and low proliferative index) had a 5-year survival of 74% compared with 54% for the unfavorable group (high proliferative index or nondiploid, P less than 0.001). This grouping was prognostic for survival in B2 (P less than 0.001), C (P = 0.013), colon (P less than 0.001), and rectal (P = 0.026) patient subsets. This study indicates that cell kinetic parameters are important and independent prognostic factors for Stages B2 and C colorectal cancer. 
Bilateral perilymph fistula in an adult. Sudden hearing loss is a symptom caused by a variety of diseases, among them also a perilymph fistula. The occurrence of bilateral perilymph fistula is rare, and was reported only associated with head trauma. A case of a bilateral perilymph fistula, without head trauma in an adult construction worker is reported. To the best of our knowledge this is the first bilateral case caused by physical effort to be reported in the literature. 
Comparison of lumbar plexus block versus conventional opioid analgesia after total knee replacement. A randomised controlled study was undertaken to assess the analgesic efficacy of continuous lumbar plexus block for the first 48 hours after total knee replacement surgery. Boluses of 0.5% bupivacaine with adrenaline 1 in 200,000 (0.3 ml/kg) were administered through a cannula inserted into the neurovascular sheath of the femoral nerve. Thirteen patients who received this block required significantly less morphine than a control group of 16 patients. Pain scores were similar and there were no complications related to this technique. 
Lovastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis. Lovastatin is a new drug that has become popular for the treatment of patients with hyperlipidemias. Rhabdomyolysis is a well-documented and potentially dangerous side effect of lovastatin therapy. Critical care nurses should be aware of the symptoms and treatment of rhabdomyolysis. Patients receiving lovastatin should be instructed to report muscle pain or weakness and dark urine immediately. It should be determined whether patients are at risk for development of rhabdomyolysis from other causes so that lovastatin can be withheld. Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious complications in patients with lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. 
Do primary dysfunctions in neural control of arterial pressure contribute to hypertension? This article is a summary of the physiological and clinical evidence that links the cause of essential hypertension to the brain. We stress the potential importance of a biochemical disturbance in the central role of angiotensin II in the regulation of arterial pressure. While the evidence is compelling, we acknowledge the need for further complete studies on this timely subject. 
Drug abuse and headache. Substance abuse has been reported frequently in chronic headache patients. The problem exists in most Western countries. Abuse of various compounds frequently leads to a state of dependency. Prescription as well as over-the-counter agents are often abused. Aspirin, acetaminophen, and caffeine are the most frequently abused compounds. Butalbital, ergot alkaloids, NSAIDS, and narcotic and oral or intranasal sympathomimetics are often abused. Patients with chronic daily headache complain of symptoms that may suggest a mixed-type headache. Features of migraine and muscle contraction headache often coexist in these individuals. It has been suggested that the most frequent cause for the transformation of a periodic headache into a daily headache is substance abuse. Substance abuse and drug dependency have multiple causes, and the etiology will reside with the compounds that are used to excess. The problem may arise as a result of poor instructions from the physician, improper diagnosis with gradual escalation in amounts of drug consumed, or a reinforcement mechanism and a brain stimulation-reward effect. The brain reward system has been studied with narcotics and psychomotor stimulants. It may be activated to a lesser degree with ergotamine, barbiturates, and other abused substances. The long-term effects of substance abuse are contingent on the compounds that are used. They may result in organ damage, medical complications, vascular injury, and a refractory state with chronic headache that eludes successful management of the headache disorder. Patients exhibit a less-than-satisfactory quality of life and are often depressed. Treatment includes outpatient care in cooperative, less dependent patients. Often patients will require inpatient management in order to discontinue use of the abused agents. Pharmacologic agents, behavior modification, psychotherapy, dietary intervention, and acupuncture may be necessary to treat the patient. Each patient must be treated by an interested physician, and the patient will require one or more of the preceding measures for a successful outcome. Often abused compounds must be discontinued in order to obtain a satisfactory response in an individual with chronic headache. 
Nutritional therapy for infants with diarrhea. The appropriate choice of treatment for infants with diarrhea has long provoked debate. Growth of infants with diarrhea is adversely affected by associated diseases including anorexia, malabsorption, catabolic response to infection, and iatrogenic starvation. To prevent the negative effects of diarrhea on the nutrition of infants, continued feeding during the active and early convalescent phases has been recommended. Although this concept is not new, until recently it has been little used in the treatment of diarrhea. In this article we examine the current knowledge about, and trends in, feeding infants with diarrhea. We will discuss treatments for the well-nourished infant with acute diarrhea, the infant with prolonged diarrhea, and the malnourished infant. Information regarding the use of local staples will also be provided. 
Restenosis after coronary angioplasty: a multivariate statistical model to relate lesion and procedure variables to restenosis. The M-HEART Investigators. The Multi-Hospital Eastern Atlantic Restenosis Trial group obtained follow-up angiography in 510 patients with 598 successfully dilated coronary lesions who were enrolled in a controlled trial of the effects of a single dose of 1 g of methylprednisolone on restenosis after coronary angioplasty. The overall restenosis rate was 39.6%. The strongest univariate relations to the restenosis rate were found for lesion location (saphenous vein graft, 68%; left anterior descending artery, 45%; left circumflex artery and right coronary artery, 32%; p = 0.002); lesion length (less than or equal to 4.6 mm, 33%; greater than 4.6 mm, 45%; p = 0.001); percent stenosis before angioplasty (less than or equal to 73%, 25%; greater than 73%, 43%; p = 0.005), percent stenosis after angioplasty (less than or equal to 21%, 33%; greater than 21%, 46%; p = 0.017) and arterial diameter (less than 2.9 mm, 44%; greater than or equal to 2.9 mm, 34%; p = 0.036). Two multivariate models to predict restenosis probability were developed with use of stepwise logistic regression. The preprocedural model, which included only variables whose values were known before angioplasty, entered lesion length, vein graft location, left anterior descending artery location, percent stenosis before angioplasty, eccentric lesion and arterial diameter. The postprocedural model, which also included variables whose values were known after angioplasty was performed, was similar to the preangioplasty model except that it also entered postangioplasty percent stenosis and "optimal" balloon sizing but did not enter eccentric lesion. These data indicate that the probability of restenosis after angioplasty is determined predominantly by the characteristics of the lesion being dilated. They are consistent with the known intimal proliferative mechanism of restenosis, offer a means of identifying lesions at unusually high or low risk of restenosis, and of predicting the likelihood that a particular lesion will restenose after angioplasty and provide a rationale for stratification by restenosis probability in the design of future studies of restenosis. 
Genetic dissection of susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in inbred mice. Mice of some inbred strains, such as 21-day-old DBA/2J mice, have generalized convulsions when exposed to intense auditory stimulation. Analysis of susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in BXD recombinant inbred strains has demonstrated the influence of at least three loci. One locus, Asp-1, is located on chromosome 12 between Ah and D12Nyu1; another locus, Asp-2, is on chromosome 4, tightly linked to b. Here we report evidence that Asp-2 is located within an 8-centimorgan segment distal to b and that Asp-3 is linked to Mtv-1 on chromosome 7. We also present evidence that these three loci account for most of the heritable variation in susceptibility to audiogenic seizures in crosses of DBA/2J and C57BL/6J mice and that susceptibility to audiogenic seizures is influenced by genomic imprinting. Thus, genomic imprinting may complicate linkage and mapping studies and should be considered in analyses of complex modes of inheritance. 
Genetically determined steady-state interaction between encainide and quinidine in patients with arrhythmias. A genetically determined pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interaction between quinidine and single doses of encainide in healthy volunteers has previously been described. In subjects with the extensive metabolizer phenotype, quinidine blunted encainide-induced QRS prolongation (a marker of sodium channel block) because it impaired encainide biotransformation to the potent active metabolites O-desmethyl encainide (ODE) and 3-methoxy-O-desmethyl encainide. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that quinidine would inhibit sodium channel block (and by inference arrhythmia suppression) during encainide therapy in patients with the extensive metabolizer phenotype. Surprisingly, however, in eight extensive metabolizer patients, the extent of QRS prolongation during chronic encainide therapy was unaltered by quinidine (139 +/- 21 vs. 139 +/- 22 msec) whereas arrhythmia suppression was enhanced (64 +/- 22 to 77 +/- 19%; P = .05). Plasma concentration data demonstrated that although encainide metabolism to ODE was partially impaired by quinidine, subsequent 3-methoxy-O-desmethyl encainide formation from ODE was virtually completely inhibited; thus steady-state plasma ODE remained unchanged whereas plasma encainide increased 10-fold (21 +/- 30 to 240 +/- 118 ng/ml; P less than .05). In contrast, no changes in disposition or in pharmacodynamics were observed in two poor metabolizers. It is concluded that the effect of this drug interaction in patients is determined by differential sensitivities to inhibition by quinidine of encainide O-demethylation and subsequent ODE 3-methoxylation. Evaluation of potential drug interactions should include assessment of possible genetic factors as well as of steady-state effects. 
Borrelia burgdorferi-associated cutaneous B cell lymphoma: clinical and immunohistologic characterization of four cases. Four patients with low-grade malignant B cell lymphoma of the skin in association with chronic Borrelia burgdorferi infection are presented. Plaque-shaped or nodular erythematous lesions with ill-defined borders were seen. Clinical progression was slow; the skin tumors occurred for up to 7 to 15 years. Extracutaneous involvement was found in only one case. Immunohistologic investigations showed an expression of B cell markers with restriction to only one light chain type and absence of T cell antigens. The growth fraction was 5% to 30%, as shown with the monoclonal antibody Ki-67. The immunoarchitecture of the tumors in three patients was unusual compared with established criteria for cutaneous B cell lymphoma and revealed similarities to mucosa-associated B cell lymphoma. Some immunohistologic heterogeneity may indicate the development of monoclonal proliferation that originated from different phases of B lymphocytic differentiation. In three cases no clinical signs of B. burgdorferi infection were found; in one patient acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans was present. The occurrence of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans and malignant lymphomas was frequently reported in the European literature before B. burgdorferi was recognized. These findings suggest a relation between B. burgdorferi infection and cutaneous B cell lymphoma. In geographic regions where infected ticks are present, borreliosis should be considered in patients with cutaneous B cell lymphoma. 
Clinical and angiographic observations on resuscitated victims of exercise-related sudden ischemic death. The clinical and angiographic findings of 17 resuscitated victims of exercise-related sudden ischemic death are reported in an attempt to elucidate the mechanism(s) of these deaths. Ten survivors developed cardiac arrest during or after sporting activities (group A) and 7 others during or after an exercise stress test (group B). There were 15 men and 2 women. The mean age of group A was 46 years and of group B 55 years. Coronary risk factors, as well as previous angina and myocardial infarction, were more frequent in group B. Only 3 of the 17 survivors had anginal symptoms before sudden death. Sudden death in group A was associated with acute myocardial infarction in 8 and unstable angina in 2 and was associated in group B with acute myocardial infarction in 2, unstable angina in 3 and silent ischemia in 2. Coronary angiography was acutely performed in 15 patients. In most patients the ischemia-related coronary artery was totally or subtotally occluded. Clinical and angiographic findings indicate that exercise-related sudden ischemic death was due to an acute coronary event--in most cases unexpected and unpredictable. It is suggested that exercise-induced intracoronary changes were probably responsible for the development of acute coronary (sub)occlusion and sudden death. 
Effect of tissue plasminogen activator on intimal platelet accumulation in cerebral arteries after subarachnoid hemorrhage in cats. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator may be effective in preventing cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage by resolving subarachnoid clots. We previously demonstrated that blood placed on the adventitial surface of cerebral arteries enhances intimal platelet accumulation, positively correlating with endothelial damage and other pathologic changes in vessel walls. In this study, we investigated the ability of a single bolus injection of tissue plasminogen activator to prevent platelet accumulation in cerebral vessels after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Subarachnoid hemorrhage was produced in cats by the transorbital intracisternal injection of 2.5 ml autologous arterial blood around the proximal part of the right middle cerebral artery. In 10 animals, 25 micrograms tissue plasminogen activator was injected at intervals of 10 (five cats) and 60 minutes (five cats) after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracisternal physiological saline (0.5 ml) was injected in six cats 10 minutes after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Platelets labeled with indium-111 were injected intravenously just before subarachnoid hemorrhage, and their radioactivity was measured in cerebral arteries at death. The results indicated that, after subarachnoid hemorrhage, early injection of tissue plasminogen activator inhibited intimal platelet accumulation, but later injection did not, although the extent of subarachnoid clot was reduced at both plasminogen injection times. 
Murine monoclonal antibodies reactive with a variety of androgen independent Dunning rat prostate adenocarcinoma sublines also reactive with human prostate adenocarcinoma. Murine hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibody (MCA) to Dunning rat prostate adenocarcinoma R-3327HIS (androgen independent type) has been produced by fusing P3x63 Ag8-653 myeloma cells with splenocytes of BALB/c mice which were immunized with R-3327HIS tumor cell membranes. One monoclonal antibody designated MCA-R1 (IgG2a subtype) produced an intense immunostaining of various androgen independent Dunning rat prostate tumor sublines (HIS, HIM, HIF, AT-1, AT-2, AT-3, MAT-Lu and MAY-Ly-Lu), but did not stain other tumors of rat origin or normal rat tissues. Marginal immunostaining was detected in the androgen responsive R-3327H and R-3327G tumor subline. Although MCA-R1 antibody did not react with the regressed prostate tumor of R-3327H or R-3327G, it strongly reacted with the relapsed prostate tumor from either R-3327H or R-3327G tumor derived from rats were treated with diethyl stilbestrol (DES) or castration. MCA-R1 antibody also produced a strong cross-reaction with human prostate adenocarcinoma. Like the Dunning rat tumor, human adenocarcinoma exhibited distinct immunostaining patterns with respect to intracellular localization among well differentiated, moderately differentiated and poorly differentiated tumor. Benign prostatic hyperplasia or other normal tissues did not stain. Immunofluorescence, immunoprecipitation, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and radioautographic analysis revealed that the Dunning rat prostate tumor antigen recognized (m.wt. 50 and 120 Kd) by MCA-R1 antibody are localized on both cell surface and in the cytoplasm. This MCA may represent a potential reagent for the study of tumor biology and immunotherapy of prostate tumor. 
Clinical features of Behcet's disease. Report of four cases. Behcet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology. The unifying histologic reaction pattern is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis that affects predominantly the skin, oral mucosa, and eyes. Many other sites of involvement have been reported but are inconsistently found in individual patients. Early recognition and treatment of Behcet's disease may help prevent devastating permanent sequelae such as blindness. Because oral involvement is often the first manifestation of this disorder, dental practitioners are in a unique position to help these patients. We report four cases of Behcet's disease in North American patients. Diagnostic criteria and treatment options are reviewed. 
Neglected topics in the treatment of chronic pain patients--relapse, noncompliance, and adherence enhancement. Although published treatment outcome studies for chronic pain have provided favorable support for the efficacy of many pain clinics and the use of specific modalities such as biofeedback and relaxation, there are several factors that mitigate against euphoria. Two related factors that influence interpretation of these reported outcomes are discussed, namely, noncompliance with therapeutic recommendations during treatment and subsequent to treatment termination, and relapse. Conceptual and methodological problems for establishing the prevalence of noncompliance and relapse are reviewed. Several factors that contribute to noncompliance (individual differences, nature of disease or injury, characteristics of the prescribed treatment regimen, health-care provider-patient relationship, and contextual) are discussed. The literature reveals that noncompliance with treatment regimens is quite prevalent across diverse treatment modalities and pain syndromes. The incidence of relapse following initially successful treatment of persistent pain also appears to be high, ranging from 30% to 60%. Studies on arthritis and heterogeneous pain clinic populations suggest that noncompliance and relapse are related; however, this association is less well established for headache patients. Strategies for assessing compliance (i.e., self-report, behavioral, biochemical, and clinical outcome) and the perspectives' of patients and health-care providers on the application of self-care recommendations are discussed. Strategic planning and adherence enhancement tactics to facilitate maintenance of post-treatment gains are described. 
Outbreaks of diarrheal illness associated with cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)-like bodies--Chicago and Nepal, 1989 and 1990. Recent reports have described the detection of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae)-like bodies (CLB) in the stools of persons with a prolonged syndrome of diarrhea, anorexia, and fatigue (1-3). In each of these reports, affected persons either were immunocompromised or had recently traveled to tropical countries. During 1989 and 1990, the first three reported outbreaks of this CLB-associated syndrome occurred in immunocompetent populations, affecting at least 150 persons. This report summarizes investigations of these outbreaks, which occurred in Chicago in 1990 and in Kathmandu, Nepal, in 1989 and 1990. 
Promoting heart health for Southeast Asians: a database for planning interventions. This paper is a report of baseline data that the authors collected on the prevalence of hypertension in a sample of 397 Southeast Asian immigrants residing in central Ohio and the implications of those data for the design of ethnically approved and scientifically valid interventions. The context for collection of these data over a 9-month period in 1989 is described. Baseline demographic characteristics including distributions by ethnicity, sex, age, and length of stay in the United States, as well as family heart health history, hypertension level, and heart health awareness of these subjects are presented. For example, 85 percent of the immigrants did not know what could be done to prevent heart disease. Implications for the design of ethnically approved and scientifically valid prevention strategies are discussed. Based on these data, the authors realized that multiple health education strategies tailored to what they were learning about Southeast Asians would be needed. Through Southeast Asian leaders, they were led to using wall calendars, with words specific to each Southeast Asian language, that had a monthly heart health slogan as one avenue to reach Southeast Asians. Another strategy was to develop videotapes featuring cultural content but including heart health "commercials." The authors concluded that, although scientific validity of risk reduction interventions are important, customizing these strategies to ethnically specific modes of interaction are equally important. 
Long-term assessment of right ventricular diastolic filling in patients with pulmonic valve stenosis successfully treated in childhood. Patients with severe pulmonic stenosis (PS) have right ventricular (RV) diastolic filling abnormalities detectable by tricuspid valve pulsed Doppler examination. To determine if these abnormalities persist long term after successful therapy of PS, 19 patients were examined 8 +/- 3 years after PS therapy. At the time of follow-up Doppler examination, the PS gradient was 15 +/- 8 mm Hg. From the tricuspid valve inflow Doppler study, the following measurements were obtained at peak inspiration: peak velocities at rapid filling (peak E) and during atrial contraction (peak A), ratio of peak E to peak A velocities, RV peak filling rate normalized for stroke volume, deceleration time, the fraction of filling in the first 0.33 of diastole as well as under the E and A waves, and the ratio of E to A area. Data from PS follow-up patients were compared with our previously reported data from 12 age-related control subjects and 14 untreated patients with PS. Patients with PS who were followed up had higher peak E velocity (0.75 +/- 0.14 vs 0.59 +/- 0.21 m/s), lower peak A velocity (0.47 +/- 0.09 vs 0.64 +/- 0.28 m/s), higher E/A velocity ratio (1.65 +/- 0.33 vs 1.11 +/- 0.52), higher 0.33 area fraction (0.52 +/- 0.08 vs 0.34 +/- 0.14), lower A area fraction (0.29 +/- 0.06 vs 0.45 +/- 0.21) and higher E/A area ratio (2.48 +/- 0.82 vs 1.73 +/- 1.05) than PS patients without treatment (p less than 0.03). All Doppler indexes of the patients with PS who were followed up were the same as those of the control subjects except for the peak E velocity that was slightly higher (0.75 +/- 0.14 vs 0.63 +/- 0.11 m/s), the peak A velocity that was slightly higher (0.47 +/- 0.09 vs 0.38 +/- 0.09 m/s) and the E/A area ratio that was slightly lower (2.48 +/- 0.82 vs 3.50 +/- 1.25) (p less than 0.03). Thus, at long-term follow-up, all RV diastolic filling indexes in successfully treated patients with PS improved compared with the untreated patients and approached values found in normal subjects. 
Endothelial cells express the interleukin-1 receptor type I. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) profoundly affects a number of functions of vascular cells. Two distinct IL-1 receptors (IL-1R) are expressed on different cell types: the 80 Kd IL-1RI on T cells and fibroblasts, and the 68 Kd IL-1RII on B cells and myelomonocytic cells. The presence and functionality of IL-1R on vascular cells has been investigated by using polyomatransformed mouse endothelial cell (EC) lines (sEnd.1 and tEnd.1). These cells expressed specific and saturable binding sites for IL-1 (1,273 sites per cell with kd 9.5 x 10(-11) mol/L for sEnd.1, and 771 sites per cell with kd 8.5 x 10(-11) mol/L for tEnd.1, with radioiodinated IL-1 alpha as ligand). Binding of IL-1 was also evident at single cell level by autoradiography. By cross-linking studies, the molecular weight of the IL-1 binding protein on EC was approximately 80 Kd. This was confirmed by the presence in EC of mRNA for the 80 Kd IL-1RI. The IL-1RI on EC was apparently functional, since EC responded to IL-1 with IL-6 mRNA expression and IL-6 bioactivity production. These results were extended to human EC and vascular smooth muscle cells, which were also found to express mRNA for IL-1RI. 
Physiological assessment of sensitivity of noninvasive testing for coronary artery disease. The sensitivity of three noninvasive tests for coronary artery disease was assessed by means of quantitative indexes of disease severity in three different groups of patients. The overall population consisted of 110 subjects with limited coronary artery disease and no myocardial infarction. Planar dipyridamole-201Tl scintigraphy was evaluated in 31 patients, computer-assisted exercise treadmill in 28, and high-dose dipyridamole echocardiography testing in 51. Sensitivity was assessed by rigorous gold standards to define disease severity, such as measurement of minimum cross-sectional area and percent area of stenosis, by quantitative computerized coronary angiography (Brown/Dodge method). On the basis of the results of previous studies, the presence of physiologically significant coronary artery disease was indicated by a stenotic minimum cross-sectional area (MCSA) of less than 2.0 mm2 or a greater than 75% area of stenosis. With MCSA as the gold standard, dipyridamole-201Tl scintigraphy, computerized exercise treadmill, and dipyridamole echocardiography testing showed sensitivities of 52%, 54%, and 61%, respectively, in the three different patient cohorts enrolled. With percent area of stenosis as the gold standard, the sensitivity figures obtained for dipyridamole-201Tl, computerized exercise treadmill, and dipyridamole echocardiography testing were 64%, 54%, and 69%, respectively. For each of the three tests, sensitivity increased with increasing lesion severity. Sensitivity was also better in patients with left anterior descending coronary (LAD) disease when compared with patients with left circumflex or right coronary artery disease. Results of these studies, which were obtained with more strict patient selection criteria and by more rigorous gold standards than previous studies, demonstrate that in patients with limited coronary artery disease none of the tests evaluated is definitely superior in sensitivity. 
Common complaints with cardiac implications in children. Chest pain, palpitations, and dizziness are not infrequent complaints in the office of a primary care physician. Historical events and physical findings can lead to a more accurate determination of cardiac causes of these symptoms. Electrocardiogram and chest radiographs are two additional tests most often helpful in determining cardiac causes of symptoms. 
Relationship between K-ras oncogene activation and smoking in adenocarcinoma of the human lung. To investigate a possible relationship between the exposure to tobacco smoke and the presence of ras point mutations, we examined lung adenocarcinoma samples from 27 smokers and from 27 nonsmokers. Activating point mutations in K-ras (also known as KRAS2) and N-ras (also known as NRAS) were determined by using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide hybridization to detect the mutated sequences. Mutations were more often found in adenocarcinomas obtained from smokers (eight of 27) than in adenocarcinomas obtained from nonsmokers (two of 27) (P = .044, Fisher's exact test). All mutations were present in K-ras codon 12. None of the other parameters examined differed significantly between the ras-positive and ras-negative groups. We conclude that exposure to carcinogenic agents in tobacco smoke is an important factor in the induction of point mutations in K-ras in human lung adenocarcinomas, but that K-ras mutations may also infrequently occur in tumors of non-smokers. 
Left main coronary artery and femoral artery vasospasm associated with cocaine use. A woman had diffuse vascular spasm related to cocaine use. She presented with evidence of an acute anterior myocardial infarction but had no rise in creatinine phosphokinase levels. Cardiac catheterization showed 90 percent proximal left main coronary artery narrowing. The catheterization was complicated by right femoral artery spasm. A repeat catheterization after treatment with nitroglycerin and diltiazem showed 30 percent proximal left main coronary artery narrowing. This catheterization was complicated by left femoral artery spasm. An exercise treadmill test was negative for ischemia. 
Decreased serum interleukin-2 level in patients with chronic headache. Some cellular immune functions are impaired in cluster headache patients. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a polypeptide secreted by antigen or mitogen-actuated T lymphocytes that functions as a growth factor for T cells. To investigate cellular immune functions in patients with chronic headache, we measured the IL-2 concentration of sera in patients with migraine and in patients with tension-type headache. Thirteen subjects suffering from migraine without aura (5 males and 8 females, mean age: 32.8 years) and 46 subjects (20 males and 26 females, mean age: 39.7 years) with tension-type headache (TH) were selected for this study. Forty-three normal healthy volunteers composed the control group (15 males and 28 females, average age 41.6 years). The IL-2 levels of sera were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. The IL-2 levels of sera were 3.18 +/- 1.8 U/ml (mean +/- SD) in the healthy controls, 2.29 +/- 2.6 U/ml in the patients with migraine and 1.59 +/- 1.0 U/ml in the patients with TH. The serum level of IL-2 in the patients with migraine was significantly lower than in the controls. The serum level of IL-2 in the patients with TH was significantly lower than in the controls. The central nervous system (CNS) has been considered to be involved in the development of the immune phenomena. In the patients with TH or migraine, reduction in platelet 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels and sympathetic hypofunction have been observed. These phenomena might reflect decrease in 5-HT levels in CNS in the patients with TH or migraine. The decreased serum IL-2 level, observed in this study, might reflect a reduction in 5-HT or catecholamine levels in CNS in the patients with migraine or TH. 
Tolerance and safety of pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with adenosine in association with thallium-201 scintigraphy in patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Adenosine thallium-201 myocardial scintigraphy is a promising test for coronary artery disease detection, but its safety has not been reported in large patient cohorts. Accordingly, the tolerance and safety profile of adenosine infusion were analyzed in 607 patients (351 men, 256 women, mean age 63 +/- 11 years) undergoing this test either because of suspected coronary artery disease (Group I, n = 482) or for risk stratification early (5.2 +/- 2.8 days) after myocardial infarction (Group II, n = 125). Adenosine increased the heart rate from 74.5 +/- 14.0 to 91.8 +/- 15.9 beats/min (p less than 0.001) and decreased systolic blood pressure from 137.8 +/- 26.8 to 120.7 +/- 26.1 mm Hg (p less than 0.001). Side effects were frequent and similar in both groups. Flushing occurred in 35%, chest pain in 34%, headache in 21% and dyspnea in 19% of patients. Only 35.6% of Group I patients with chest pain during adenosine infusion had concomitant transient perfusion abnormalities, compared with 60.7% of Group II patients (p less than 0.05). First- and second-degree AV block occurred in 9.6% and 3.6% of patients, respectively, and ischemic ST changes in 12.5% of cases. Concomitance of chest pain and ischemic ST depression was uncommon (6%) but, when present, predicted perfusion abnormalities in 73% of patients. Most side effects ceased rapidly after stopping the adenosine infusion. The side effects were severe in only 1.6% of patients and in only six patients (1%) was it necessary to discontinue the infusion. No serious adverse reactions such as acute myocardial infarction or death occurred. 
The antinociceptive effects of spinally administered neuropeptide Y in the rat: systematic studies on structure-activity relationship. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a 36-amino-acid, C-terminal amidated peptide that is found in bulbospinal pathways and can inhibit the release of the primary afferent C-fiber neurotransmitter, substance P. Based on these observations, the present studies examined the possible antinociceptive effects of this peptide and several NPY fragments after intrathecal administration in rats prepared with chronic intrathecal catheters. In the 52 degrees C hot plate test, NPY produced a dose-dependent elevation in the nociceptive threshold with a median effective dose of 1.1 nmol. The ordering of fragments' activity was: NPY greater than NPY16-36 greater than or equal to NPY19-36 greater than or equal to NPY14-36 greater than or equal to NPY18-36 much greater than NPY1-36-OH = NPY18-36-OH = 0. In the paw pressure test, NPY was not active, even at the highest doses examined (median effective dose greater than 20 nmol), whereas the C-terminal fragments retained their potency and produced significant increases in the pressure required to evoke escape (NPY18-36: median effective dose = 18.7 nmol). The rank ordering of activity in the paw pressure test was: NPY19-36 greater than or equal to NPY14-36 greater than or equal to NPY18-36 greater than or equal to NPY16-36 much greater than NPY = NPY18-36-OH = 0. Peptide YY, human pancreatic polypeptide and avian pancreatic polypeptide behave similarly to NPY. 
Disappearance of thalamic pain after parietal subcortical stroke. A hypertensive man had a long standing history of contumacious hyperpathia in the right upper extremity, resistant to medical therapy, secondary to a lacunar infarct in the left thalamus. A second cerebrovascular accident caused a small lesion in the left corona radiata, interrupting the thalamoparietal interconnections, and terminated the pain instantly. Interruption of the subcortical parietal white matter may more effectively control pain than cortical lesions. A few surgeons have successfully treated rebellious chronic pain with stereotaxic operations in the corona radiata, resulting in lesions very similar to our patient's. This overlooked and nearly forgotten technique may still have value in treating selected cases. 
DNA flow cytometric analysis of primary operable breast cancer. Relation of ploidy and S-phase fraction to outcome of patients in NSABP B-04. Between 1971 and 1974, 1665 women with primary operable breast cancer were randomized into a National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trial (B-04) conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of several different regimens of surgical and radiation therapy. No systemic therapy was given. Cells from archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissue taken from 398 patients were analyzed for ploidy and S-phase fraction (SPF) using flow cytometry. Characteristics and outcome of patients with satisfactory DNA histograms were comparable to those from whom no satisfactory cytometric studies were available. In patients with diploid tumors (43%), the mean SPF was 3.4% +/- 2.3%; in the aneuploid population (57%), the SPF was 7.9% +/- 6.3%. Only 29.9% +/- 17.3% of cells in aneuploid tumors were aneuploid. Diploid tumors were more likely than aneuploid tumors to be of good nuclear grade (P less than 0.001) and smaller size (P equals 0.03). More tumors with high SPF were of poor nuclear grade than were tumors with low SPF (P equals 0.002). No significant difference in 10-year disease-free survival (P equals 0.3) or survival (P equals 0.1) was found between women with diploid or aneuploid tumors. Patients with low SPF tumors had a 13% better disease-free survival (P equals 0.0006) than those with a high SPF and a 14% better survival (P equals 0.007) at 10 years than patients with high SPF tumors. After adjustment for clinical tumor size, the difference in both disease-free survival and survival between patients with high and low SPF tumors was only 10% (P equals 0.04 and 0.08, respectively). Although SPF was found to be of independent prognostic significance for disease-free survival and marginal significance for survival, it did not detect patients with such a good prognosis as to preclude their receiving chemotherapy. The overall survival of patients with low SPF was only 53% at 10 years. These findings and those of others indicate that additional studies are necessary before tumor ploidy and SPF can be used to select patients who should or should not receive systemic therapy. 
Sympathetic responses of patients with congestive heart failure to cold pressor stimulus. Studies in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) demonstrate blunting of sympathoexcitatory responses to baroreflex perturbation. Whereas experimental and limited clinical evidence suggests impairment of baroreflex mechanisms as the etiology of these attenuated responses, an alternative mechanism would be an inability of patients with CHF to increase sympathetic neural outflow above markedly elevated baseline levels. Hemodynamic and sympathetic neural responses (peroneal microneurography) were therefore compared of normal subjects (n = 10) and patients with CHF (n = 10) during the non-baroreflex sympathoexcitatory stimulus of the cold pressor test. The cold pressor stimulus produced increases in arterial pressure and heart rate in both groups. During hand immersion in ice water, normal subjects demonstrated significant increases in muscle sympathetic nerve activity expressed as burst frequency (20 +/- 2 to 28 +/- 3 bursts/min, p less than 0.01), total integrated nerve activity (224 +/- 41 to 342 +/- 62 U/min, p less than 0.05), and total activity corrected for accompanying changes in heart rate (375 +/- 81 to 538 +/- 118 U/100 heart beats, p less than 0.05). Similarly, despite elevated control levels of sympathetic activity, patients with CHF also demonstrated significant sympathoexcitatory responses to the cold pressor stimulus, with increases in muscle sympathetic nerve burst frequency (60 +/- 7 to 67 +/- 7 bursts/min, p less than 0.01) total integrated nerve activity (818 +/- 159 to 1,015 +/- 191 U, p less than 0.001), and total activity corrected for accompanying changes in heart rate (1,008 +/- 178 to 1,173 +/- 201 U/100 heart beats, p less than 0.01). 
Detection of hepatitis C viral RNA in serum of a patient with acute non A, non B hepatitis. The sequence of serologic events in a patient with acute type C hepatitis associated with intravenous drug abuse is described. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid was detectable in serum during the acute episode of hepatitis, whereas antibody to the hepatitis C virus appeared later, after the acute illness had subsided. The patient developed chronic hepatitis with persistently elevated serum aminotransferase activities. Both hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid and antibody to hepatitis C virus persisted in serum, together with elevated serum aminotransferases. Thus, detection of HCV RNA may be useful in the diagnosis of acute type C hepatitis, particularly in the absence of detectable antibody to the hepatitis C virus. 
A circulating factor(s) mediates cell depolarization in hemorrhagic shock. Cell depolarization in hemorrhagic shock has been attributed to hypoperfusion, but the mechanism remains unclear. Suspensions of single cell lines loaded with the potential-sensitive fluorescent dye bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbiturioc acid) trimethine oxonal (DIBAC) and exposed for 30 minutes to rat plasma drawn either before or after hemorrhagic shock (bled 20 mL/kg: mean arterial blood pressure less than 40 mmHg) were studied. Plasma drawn after, but not before, hemorrhage led to partial depolarization regardless of cell type (rat H9C2 skeletal muscle, A-10 smooth muscle, C-9 liver, adrenal, kidney, red blood cell [RBC], white blood cell [WBC]) or species (cat, dog, pig RBC; cat WBC; mouse C2C12 skeletal muscle; and human intestinal smooth muscle [HISM]). Dialysis did not remove the factor(s), suggesting a molecular weight of more than 10,000 daltons. The factor appeared within 5 minutes of shock. The depolarization amplitude increased as a function of plasma concentration and demonstrated saturation kinetics indicating specific receptor binding. Cells were equivalently oxygenated, excluding hypoperfusion as a necessary condition for depolarization. Tumor necrosis factor or platelet activating factor alone or in combination were not effective in this system. Stable measurements can be obtained with this noninvasive system that avoids cell injury consequent to cell impalement with electrodes. This system provides a sensitive in vitro bioassay that should permit identification of the plasma factors mediating cell depolarization, as well as definition of the responsible intracellular mechanisms. 
Ten-year survivors after surgical treatment and perioperative irradiation for esophageal carcinoma. Ten of 150 patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus and surgically treated, survived for more than 10 years. All 10 underwent a complete resection of the primary tumor and extensive lymph node dissection plus perioperative irradiation. The clinicopathologic findings in these 10 patients were reviewed. Five were female. Seven of the tumors exceeded 6 cm in length; seven were early stage, and the remaining three were advanced stage tumors. Lymph node metastases were evident in three, lymph vessel permeation was recognized in four, and no vascular vessel permeation was seen in any tumor. Two tumors had a characteristic appearance of carcinoma with lymphoid stroma, suggesting a good prognosis. In six for which cytophotometric DNA analysis could be done, four were type II, two were type III, and none was type IV. Thus, a complete resection of the primary tumor and extensive lymph node dissection can lead to a long survival time even for those with an advanced primary esophageal carcinoma. 
Dysphagia after Nissen fundoplication. Nissen fundoplication is a commonly used antireflux operation. After this operation symptoms such as dysphagia, inability to belch and vomit, and gas bloating are frequently reported in the literature. In 32 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication 3.5-18 years ago, postprocedure dysphagia was studied using conventional manometry and 24 h ambulatory pressure and pH recording. Our study indicates that dysphagia tends to decrease after surgery. Neither conventional nor ambulatory pressure recording revealed motor abnormalities that could be held responsible for the dysphagia. Therefore, the data do not support the concept that dysphagia is a major complication of Nissen fundoplication. 
Pulmonary hypertension in a lupus clinic: experience with twenty-four patients. The clinical and serological findings on 24 patients with pulmonary hypertension (PHT) seen at the Lupus Clinic of St. Thomas' Hospital, London are presented. Twenty-two patients had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), one other a primary antiphospholipid syndrome and another an SLE/progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) overlap syndrome. In 21 of the 24 patients, the disease resembled the primary idiopathic variety with clear lung fields and no clinical evidence of pulmonary thromboembolism, although angiography and nuclear perfusion scans were not performed. Two patients clearly suffered from thromboembolic PHT, one with SLE and one with an antiphospholipid syndrome. One patient with SLE/PSS overlap syndrome developed pulmonary fibrosis. The frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and antibodies to cardiolipin was 68% which appears to be higher than generally found in patients with SLE, and the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. Other associated features of the antiphospholipid syndrome in this group were uncommon. Death occurred in 13 of the 24 patients, 4 were lost to followup and 7 are known to be alive. The cause of death was circulatory failure in the majority; sudden death once this complication occurred was particularly common. One patient died from adult respiratory distress syndrome and one from hemorrhagic shock while undergoing heart/lung transplantation. Two patients underwent successful heart/lung transplantation. One, however, died of a mesenteric occlusion and bowel infarction following a second lung transplantation because of rejection of the first heart/lung transplantation after one year. The other patient is alive and well 2 years later. 
Accelerated fractionation radiation therapy for advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. We treated 14 patients who had advanced head and neck cancer with an accelerated fractionation schedule of irradiation consisting of two fractions given 6 hours apart. In the morning a volume of 1.7 Gy was given to an area that encompassed the entire tumor, enlarged lymph nodes, and all areas at risk for microscopic disease. Six hours later, 1.1 Gy was given to an area that included only the tumor and any enlarged lymph nodes, with a 2-cm margin. The treatment was well tolerated; of the 13 patients who completed therapy, six did not require a break in therapy, and seven patients did. The median rest period was 2 days. There was no grade 4 toxicity. Grade 3 toxicity included skin changes (one case), mucositis (two), dysphagia (two), weight loss (three), and a decrease in the hemoglobin level (one case). The response rate in the 13 who completed therapy was 13/13 (100%); 11 of the 13 (83%) had a complete response. Only one of the 11 who achieved a complete response had failure at the primary site. At a median follow-up of 24 months, the absolute survival was 7/13 (54%) and the corrected survival was 7/10 (70%). This technique permits radiation therapy to be given on an accelerated schedule without a planned break in treatment. The overall response rate and survival at 2 years was excellent. 
Both intravenous lidocaine and morphine reduce the pain of postherpetic neuralgia. We studied the analgesic efficacy of an intravenous infusion of lidocaine and morphine in 19 adults with well-established postherpetic neuralgia in a three-session, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Compared with saline placebo, both lidocaine and morphine reduced pain intensity. Reductions in pain did not correlate with side effects produced by the infusions. For morphine, there was a significant correlation between reductions in pain intensity and blood level achieved. In the majority of subjects who reported definite pain relief, allodynia also disappeared. The results show that neuropathic pain can respond to opioids and to systemically administered local anesthetic drugs. 
Acoustic neuroma (schwannoma) surgery 1978-1990. A series of 151 patients with 154 acoustic schwannomas have been operated upon in Manchester Royal Infirmary by a joint Otological and Neurosurgical team, employing either the translabyrinthine or the suboccipital approach. The perioperative mortality rate was 3 per cent. Anatomical preservation of the facial nerve was achieved in 89 per cent of tumour removals and a good to normal functional result in 79 per cent of cases. Attempts at hearing preservation have been unsuccessful, largely because of the small number of patients in the series in whom useful hearing was present preoperatively. Complications included major brain stem ischaemia (1.2 per cent), CSF fistula (5 per cent) and facial dysaesthesia (7 per cent). The incidence of mortality and morbidity is directly related to tumour size and to the experience of the surgeons. A number of patients experienced an unusual type of post-operative dreamlike state which appeared to be a form of hypnagogic hallucination, and the possible neurophysiological mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is discussed. The continuing failure to attain the ideal of early diagnosis is lamented, and the importance of a flexible bidisciplinary surgical approach emphasized. 
Headaches in adolescents. Diagnosis and management. A thorough history, general physical examination, neurologic evaluation, and charting of the temporal pattern of the headache will allow the correct diagnosis to be made under most circumstances. Laboratory testing is tailored to the specific headache syndrome. Psychological factors are important in all forms of adolescent headache and should be evaluated in each and every case. Once the correct diagnosis has been made, a comprehensive approach to the patient's problems, medical and psychological, will usually result in improvement. 
Hypophysectomy inhibits the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor alpha by rat macrophages: partial restoration by exogenous growth hormone or interferon gamma. We recently demonstrated that GH and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) act in a similar manner to prime macrophages in vitro and in vivo for enhanced superoxide anion release. In this report we investigated the physiological role of the pituitary gland and GH in in vivo priming of resident peritoneal macrophages for the synthesis of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) in vitro. Compared to normal rats, hypophysectomized animals had an 83% reduction in macrophage production of TNF alpha after in vitro stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Sham operation had no significant effect on the ability of macrophages to secrete TNF alpha in response to lipopolysaccharide. Both native pituitary-derived porcine GH (48 micrograms/rat.9 days) and native pituitary-derived rat GH (96 micrograms/rat.9 days) more than tripled the in vitro production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (342 and 358 vs. 112 U/mg protein for placebo-treated rats, respectively). Each of these preparations of GH also increased growth more than 6-fold in hypophysectomized rats (32 and 30 g vs. 5 g in placebo controls). Heat inactivation of native pituitary-derived porcine GH significantly reduced its in vivo ability to augment both TNF alpha synthesis by macrophages and body growth. Recombinant rat IFN gamma (2000 U/rat.9 days) more than tripled the production of TNF alpha by macrophages from hypophysectomized rats (343 vs. 112 U/mg protein). In contrast to its in vivo effects, addition of GH in vitro to macrophages from hypophysectomized rats did not prime these cells for the synthesis of TNF alpha, indicating an indirect mechanism of action for GH. To further test the biological relevancy of GH with respect to synthesis of TNF alpha, hemorrhagic necrosis of TNF alpha-sensitive murine methyl-cholanthrene-induced tumors was assessed in pituitary-intact mice. Native porcine GH (133 micrograms/mouse.7 days) significantly augmented both the necrosis to tumor ratio and the hemorrhage to tumor ratio. These findings establish the physiological relevance of the pituitary gland and GH in the priming of macrophages for TNF alpha synthesis. 
Increased occurrence of arrhythmias in men with ischaemic type ST-segment depression during long-term ECG recording. Prognostic impact on ischaemic heart disease: results from the prospective population study 'Men born in 1914', Malmo, Sweden. The objective of this long-term ECG (LTER) study in 394 68-year-old men, selected at random from the general population of Malmo, Sweden, was to determine the prevalence and occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias and their impact on morbidity and mortality from IHD. According to Lown classification, 29.4% (116 men) had ventricular arrhythmia (VA) group 4-5. Serious ventricular arrhythmia (Lown group 4-5) was more common in men with asymptomatic ischaemic type ST-segment depression (STD) than in those without it (37.8% vs. 26.7%: P less than 0.05). During the mean follow-up period of 53.1 months there were seven IHD deaths (6%) among the 116 patients with VA, Lown 4-5, and nine IHD deaths (3.2%) among the 278 patients without serious VA, Lown 0-3, (P = 0.26). Six and three of these deaths, respectively, were considered to be sudden (P = 0.022). The increased cardiac event rate (fatal or non-fatal MI or deaths due to chronic IHD) associated with a serious ventricular arrhythmia disappeared when history of IHD at baseline and occurrence of STD during LTER were taken into account. The study did not provide any evidence to suggest that ventricular arrhythmia was triggered by myocardial ischaemia. Five of 9 (56%) deaths due to IHD in men with STD occurred among the 38% (37/98) of patients who belonged to Lown class 4-5. It is concluded that the prognostic information derived from LTER can be improved by combined monitoring of STD and ventricular arrhythmias. 
Effect of intravenously administered dexmedetomidine on pain after laparoscopic tubal ligation. Ninety-six women undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation were randomized to receive intravenously either 0.2 or 0.4 microgram/kg of dexmedetomidine, 60 micrograms/kg of oxycodone, or 250 micrograms/kg of diclofenac for postoperative pain in a double-blind study design. The study drugs were administered in the recovery room for moderate or severe pain and were repeated until pain subsided or disappeared. In the group receiving diclofenac, 83% of the patients required analgesic supplementation with morphine. This contrasted (P less than 0.01) with 33% of the patients receiving either oxycodone or the higher dose of dexmedetomidine. After the first dose of oxycodone was injected, the visual analogue scale for pain (0%-100%) was reduced from 58% to 33%, whereas corresponding pain relief was only achieved after the third injection of 0.4 microgram/kg of dexmedetomidine. Repeated doses of 0.2 microgram/kg of diclofenac or dexmedetomidine did not reduce the visual analogue scale value by more than 17%. More sedation was seen with the higher dose of dexmedetomidine than with either diclofenac or oxycodone (P less than 0.001). Both doses of dexmedetomidine decreased heart rate when compared with diclofenac (P less than 0.001). In the group given 0.4 microgram/kg of dexmedetomidine, 33% of the patients required atropine for bradycardia. The authors conclude that after laparoscopic tubal ligation, intravenously administered dexmedetomidine relieves pain and reduces opioid drug requirement but is attended by sedation and a high incidence of bradycardia. 
Supraventricular tachycardia associated with continuous furosemide infusion. Three cases of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) associated with the use of furosemide infusion (FI) in children following cardiac surgery are reported. The SVT occurred three to seven hours after starting an infusion at 1.0 mg.kg-1.hr-1. All three patients had a diuresis of 8-10 ml.kg-1.hr-1 compared with a mean average of 2.5 ml.kg-1.hr-1 in 22 other patients who had received a similar infusion. A rapid fluid shift was the most likely mechanism of the tachycardia. Sotalol was effective in controlling the tachycardia in the two patients in whom it was tried. We now recommend a starting dose of 0.3 mg.kg-1.hr-1 in using furosemide as a continuous infusion, with hourly increments of 0.1 mg.kg-1.hr-1 until the desired diuresis is obtained. 
Influence of the lumbar interspace chosen for injection on the spread of hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine. Forty patients undergoing elective Caesarean section were allocated randomly to receive hyperbaric 0.5% bupivacaine 2.5 ml at either the L2-3 (n = 20) or L4-5 (n = 20) interspace. Spinal injection was performed with a 29-gauge needle in 38 patients and a 25-gauge needle in two. The onset time to analgesia at T10 and T6 was significantly faster and the level of analgesia at 5 and 10 min after injection significantly higher after injection at L2-3. Maximum height and range of analgesia, the level of analgesia at 15 and 20 min after injection and the number of episodes of hypotension were not significantly different between the two groups. One case of post-dural puncture headache was recorded after use of a 29-gauge needle. Overall, the choice of lumbar interspace influenced the rate of onset of analgesia, but not the final dermatomal level (mean and range) of analgesia achieved. 
Noninvasive methods in the diagnosis of ruptured aneurysm of Valsalva. Usefulness of magnetic resonance imaging and Doppler echocardiography. A ruptured aneurysm of noncoronary sinus of Valsalva was diagnosed noninvasively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as by Doppler echocardiography. Diagnosis of this disease by MRI has not been reported previously. 
Is a chest radiograph necessary in the evaluation of every febrile infant less than 8 weeks of age? This study was designed to examine the relationship between respiratory signs and the likelihood of having an abnormal chest radiograph in a sample of febrile infants less than 8 weeks of age. The sample consisted of 242 infants who were admitted during a 3-year period with temperatures greater than or equal to 38 degrees C (100.4 degrees F) and had a chest radiograph. The house officer recorded the presence of respiratory signs and symptoms including rhinorrhea, tachypnea, cough, rales, wheezes, retractions, and rhonchi. Each chest radiograph was reviewed independently according to predetermined criteria by a senior radiology resident and an attending pediatric radiologist. Interobserver agreement was 91%. Both observers were blind to the infants' respiratory signs. The chest radiograph interpretations were compared with the presence of respiratory signs. Of the 242 cases, 228 had chest radiographs available for interpretation. Of these, 27 chest radiographs (12%) were identified as abnormal, including 6 where there was initial disagreement as to the presence of an abnormality. Twenty-five (31%) of 80 infants with any respiratory signs had an abnormal chest radiograph, whereas only 2 (1%) of 148 asymptomatic infants did. The sensitivity of respiratory signs was 93% (confidence interval = 76% to 99%). These findings suggest that in the absence of respiratory signs, febrile infants are unlikely to have an abnormal chest radiograph. 
Mammographic localization and biopsy of nonpalpable breast lesions. A 5-year study. A malignancy rate of 24% was achieved as a result of needle localizations and biopsies of 548 nonpalpable mammographically detected breast lesions in 507 consecutive patients during a 5-year period. Malignancy was present in 74 (23.8%) of 311 irregular soft-tissue densities, in 40 (19.6%) of 204 cases with clustered microcalcifications, and in 33 cases (54.5%) when both features were present. Same-day admission and discharge were achieved in 491 patients and local anesthesia supplemented with intravenous sedation was used in 73 (74%) of the 98 patients (in 1989) by the end of the study period. Nonpalpable cancers were categorized pathologically as stage 0 in 25 patients (20.8%), stage I in 67 patients (55.8%), stage IIA in 24 patients (20.0%), and stage IIB in four patients (3.3%). The malignancy rate rose sharply from the fourth to the fifth decade. 
Effects of hypoxaemia and bradycardia on neonatal cerebral haemodynamics. Near infrared spectroscopy has been used to assess the effects of bradycardia and hypoxia on the cerebral circulation in the premature neonate. The technique is well tolerated and can be applied in almost any infant. Continuous monitoring of changes in cerebral oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total haemoglobin is possible. Total haemoglobin is analogous to cerebral blood volume; thus information on circulatory changes as well as oxygenation state can be obtained. Twenty five babies had cerebral monitoring carried out using this technique. During episodes of hypoxia, both spontaneous and induced, impairment of haemoglobin oxygenation within the brain was detected together with an overall increase in the total mean haemoglobin concentration, which was 0.8 x 10(-2) mmol/l. Bradycardia with apnoea also led to impairment of cerebral oxygenation, and to a rapid fall in the concentration of total mean haemoglobin to 1.4 x 10(-2) mmol/l, which was followed in some cases by an increase to above the resting value on recovery of the heart rate to a mean of 0.7 x 10(-2) mmol/l. These disturbances to total haemoglobin concentration represent abnormalities of cerebral blood volume that may be implicated in the pathogenesis of neonatal cerebral injury. 
Reirradiation for extremity soft tissue sarcomas. Local control and complications. The treatment for patients who have locally recurrent soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity after surgery and radiation therapy is primarily amputation. A second course of radiation and local excision is usually not considered because of two major concerns: radiation complications and inability to achieve local disease control. This study examines the clinical course of 32 patients who received a second course of radiation for soft tissue sarcoma. Four groups of patients were defined by the sequence of radiation (preoperative and postoperative) and surgery. Despite high cumulative doses of radiation, complications requiring amputation were rare. Local tumor control was achieved with a second course of preoperative radiation and wide local excision in 15 of 18 (84%). However, local excision and a second course of postoperative radiation resulted in eight of 14 (57%) local failure and cannot be recommended as a comparable therapy to amputation. 
Socioeconomic status in the epidemiology and treatment of hypertension. The association of socioeconomic status (SES), as indexed by educational achievement, with the prevalence, prognosis, and efficacy of treatment of hypertension in the Hypertension Detection and Follow-up Program (HDFP) was reviewed. The prevalence of hypertension varied inversely with SES during the screening program initiated to identify HDFP eligibles in 14 communities in 1973-1974. There was a strong inverse gradient of 5-year all-cause mortality with SES among the hypertensive participants referred to usual care in the HDFP. The association of mortality with SES among hypertensive subjects was eliminated by the HDFP stepped-care program. A large portion of the efficacy of the HDFP was associated with in-trial blood pressure control. Inasmuch as these results are generalizable to the nation, a large fraction of hypertension-associated morbidity and mortality in the United States was related to lower SES in the 1970s, before widespread implementation of programs resulting in increased awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension. 
Duodenocaval fistula in peptic ulceration. Duodenocaval fistula is usually caused by abdominal trauma. We report a patient in whom it was associated with peptic ulcer. 
Metastatic basal cell carcinoma: report of a case presenting with respiratory failure. Metastasis from basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of skin is rare. A case of a 58-year-old male presenting with increasing shortness of breath and right pleural effusion is described. Open right pleural biopsy demonstrated metastatic carcinoma consistent with BCC. Review of medical records from another hospital revealed that four years previously a recurrent BCC had been excised from the left back. One and three years prior to this excision, a skin lesion at this same site had been treated with electrocautery. Review of the skin excision slides demonstrated infiltrating BCC histologically very similar to the metastatic pleural neoplasm. The patient died two months after the pleural biopsy. At autopsy, the cutaneous BCC had not recurred and metastatic BCC extensively infiltrated the pleura bilaterally, with focal involvement of underlying lung parenchyma, subcarinal lymph nodes, diaphragm, and pericardium. 
Cytarabine and neurologic toxicity. Cytarabine is an effective drug in the treatment of certain hematologic malignancies and its common toxicities are myelosuppression and gastrointestinal disturbance. In the past decade, neurotoxicity has been an increasingly recognized cytarabine effect. Intrathecal (IT) cytarabine may result in myelopathy that is incompletely reversible. Combined IT drug and cranial irradiation may lead to necrotizing leukoencephalopathy. Intravenous (IV) therapy may cause a peripheral neuropathy that varies greatly in its severity. The high IV cytarabine doses now commonly used can cause seizures, cerebral dysfunction, or an acute cerebellar syndrome with an incidence up to 14%. Patient age (greater than 60 years) appears to be the most important risk factor, but drug dose/schedule, cumulative drug dose, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and concomitant use of neurotropic antiemetic agents may also influence the risk of neurotoxicity. A better understanding of the pathophysiology and pharmacology of such cytarabine-induced neuronal injury will allow this drug to be used with greater efficacy and safety. 
Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine in non-Japanese Asians. "The Japanese disease," ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, is not confined to the Japanese only. A similar incidence of 0.8% was found in this study among non-Japanese Asians. Of 5167 patients who attended the Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore for cervical spine complaints, 43 patients were found to have ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, forming the largest non-Japanese series. All but one patient were of Mongolian origin, and males were affected four times more commonly than females. Diabetes mellitus was present in 16%. There was a significant association between ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and calcification of other cervical paraspinal ligaments. It is suggested that a generalized tendency to calcification may be an important etiological factor in ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. Four of the patients required surgery, and in our experience, anterior spinal fusion with removal of the ossified ligament or multilevel laminoplasty gives satisfactory results. 
Differential regulation of rasGAP and neurofibromatosis gene product activities. The ras-encoded p21ras proteins bind GTP very tightly, but catalyse hydrolysis to GDP very slowly. In humans, two genes encode proteins that stimulate this GTPase activity (GAP, or GTPase-activating proteins), one of relative molecular mass 120,000, referred to as p120-GAP, and another NF1-GAP, which is encoded by the neurofibromatosis type-1 gene. Both GAPs are widely expressed in mammalian tissues. Here we show that although they will both bind oncogenic mutants of p21ras, neither will stimulate their GTPase activity. NF1-GAP binds to the p21ras proteins up to 300 times more efficiently than p120-GAP. The two GAPs are inhibited to different extents by certain lipids: micromolar concentrations of arachidonate, phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate affect only NF1-GAP. This inhibition does not compete with p21ras, and lipid-inactivated NF1-GAP can still bind p21ras. We used the detergent dodecyl maltoside, which inhibits only NF1-GAP, to distinguish between the two activities in cell extracts and found both types present together in several mammalian cell lines. In contrast, GAP activity in extracts of Xenopus oocytes was not affected by dodecyl maltoside. By these criteria, the mammalian cells contain both GAP activities and the oocytes have only p120-like GAP activity. These results indicate that more than one GAP regulates p21ras in the same cell. 
Anti-Ri: an antibody associated with paraneoplastic opsoclonus and breast cancer. The serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 8 women with ataxia, 6 of whom also had eye movement abnormalities believed to be opsoclonus, were found to contain a highly specific antineuronal antibody we call anti-Ri. Seven of the 8 women also had or developed cancer: carcinoma of the breast in 5, adenocarcinoma in an axillary lymph node in 1, and carcinoma of the fallopian tube in 1. Four patients presented with the neurological disorder; the cancer was diagnosed first in the other 4. Immunohistochemical studies using serum or CSF from all 8 patients revealed a highly specific antibody interaction with central nervous system neuronal nuclei but not with glial or other cells; the titer ranged from 1:5,000 to 1:320,000 in serum and from 1:2,000 to 1:16,000 in CSF. Biotinylated IgG from the patients' serum reacted with the tumors of 3 of 4 patients with anti-Ri antibody but not with breast cancers from patients without anti-Ri antibody. Immunoblots against cerebral cortex neuronal extracts identified protein antigens of 55-kd and 80-kd relative molecular mass. Serum titers by immunoblot ranged from 1:500 to more than 1:40,000 and CSF titers, from 1:10 to 1:2,000. The relative amount of anti-Ri was always higher in CSF than in serum. The antibody was not present in sera from normal individuals; patients with breast cancer without opsoclonus; other patients with opsoclonus; or patients with other paraneoplastic syndromes related to breast, ovarian, or small-cell lung cancer. We conclude that the presence of anti-Ri antibody identifies a subset of patients with paraneoplastic ataxia and eye movement disorders (opsoclonus) who usually suffer from breast or other gynecological cancer; the antibody when present is a useful marker for an underlying malignancy. 
Analgesic effect of intraarticular morphine after arthroscopic knee surgery BACKGROUND. Opioids can produce potent antinociceptive effects by interacting with local opioid receptors in inflamed peripheral tissue. In this study we examined the analgesic effects of the intraarticular, as compared with intravenous, administration of morphine after arthroscopic knee surgery. METHODS. In a double-blind, randomized trial, we studied 52 patients who had received one of four injections at the end of surgery. The patients in group 1 (n = 18) received 1 mg of morphine intraarticularly and saline intravenously; those in group 2 (n = 15), saline intraarticularly and 1 mg of morphine intravenously; those in group 3 (n = 10), 0.5 mg of morphine intraarticularly and saline intravenously; and those in group 4 (n = 9), 1 mg of morphine and 0.1 mg of naloxone intraarticularly and saline intravenously. The volume of the intraarticular injections was 40 ml, and that of the intravenous injections was 1 ml. After 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 24 hours, postoperative pain was assessed with a visual-analogue scale, a numerical-rating scale, and the McGill pain questionnaire. The need for supplemental analgesic agents, the patients' vital signs, and the occurrence of side effects were monitored. RESULTS. All pain scores were lower in group 1 than in group 2 at all times. The differences were significant (P less than 0.05) at three, four, and six hours (mean [+/- SD] visual-analogue score at six hours, 9 +/- 13 mm vs. 37 +/- 31 mm). The mean (+/- SD) consumption of supplemental analgesic medication per 24 hours was significantly lower in group 1 (36 +/- 51 mg of diclofenac and 1.2 +/- 3.4 mg of meperidine) than in group 2 (75 +/- 42 mg of diclofenac and 14 +/- 18 mg of meperidine, P less than 0.05). The visual-analogue scores in group 3 were slightly but not significantly higher than those in group 1 at all times except 6 and 24 hours after injection. The visual-analogue scores were significantly higher in group 4 than in group 1 one to four hours after injection (P less than 0.05), indicating that the analgesic effect of intraarticular morphine was reversible by naloxone. CONCLUSIONS. Low doses of intraarticular morphine can significantly reduce pain after knee surgery through an action specific to local opioid receptors that reaches its maximal effect three to six hours after injection. 
Possible association between mutant frequency in peripheral lymphocytes and domestic radon concentrations To investigate whether previously found geographical correlations between leukaemia incidence and exposure to radon are reflected in a detectable mutagenic effect on individuals, the frequency of mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (hprt) in peripheral blood T lymphocytes was measured in subjects with known domestic radon concentrations. These concentrations were measured in December, 1989, in houses in Street, Somerset, UK, by passive alpha-track radon detectors. 20 non-smoking subjects aged 36-55 years were selected from the patient list at the local health centre on the basis of the radon concentrations in their homes--the range selected varied by a factor of ten. Blood samples for preparation of T lymphocytes were taken in July, 1990. There was a significant association between the log mutant frequency and radon concentration (t = 3.47, p less than 0.01). A second analysis of a further set of radon measurements (October, 1990, to January, 1991), in both living rooms and bedrooms, and repeated mutant frequency determinations also showed a significant relation, which remained significant even after exclusion of the highest frequency and adjustment for subject's age and cloning efficiency. These data must be regarded as preliminary and further more extensive studies should be done to determine whether the observed association is causal. 
Oxygen delivery-dependent oxygen consumption in acute respiratory failure. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2) in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and non-ARDS acute respiratory failure. DESIGN: Intervention study of a consecutive sample of patients admitted to the ICU with the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: Thirteen consecutive patients with a diagnosis of ARDS and 11 with a diagnosis of respiratory failure not due to ARDS. Patients were monitored with an oximetric pulmonary artery catheter and mechanically ventilated. INTERVENTIONS: DO2 was decreased by the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (20 cm H2O), and subsequently increased by an iv infusion of dobutamine (10 micrograms/kg.min). RESULTS: After the application of PEEP, DO2 decreased significantly in both groups. However, VO2 decreased significantly (p less than .01) only in the ARDS group. When dobutamine was infused, DO2 increased significantly (p less than .01) in both groups, but VO2 increased only in ARDS patients. DO2 correlated significantly with VO2 both in ARDS (r2 = .81, p less than .01) and in non-ARDS (r2 = .38, p less than .05) patients. The correlation coefficient was significantly higher for ARDS than for non-ARDS patients. Comparing the slopes of the regression lines, a stronger dependency of VO2 on DO2 was found in ARDS than in non-ARDS respiratory failure (p less than .001). The oxygen extraction ratio correlated with DO2 in non-ARDS patients (r2 = .49, p less than .05), but not in ARDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: VO2 is dependent on DO2 over a wide range of DO2 values in acute respiratory failure. This dependency phenomenon is much stronger in ARDS than in respiratory failure due to other causes. Due to the abnormal dependency of VO2 on DO2, changes in the oxygenation status may not be reflected by changes in mixed venous oxygen saturation in ARDS. 
Effect of metoclopramide on angiotensins, aldosterone, and atrial peptide during hypoxia. The coupling of aldosterone with renin is altered during acute hypoxemia. We measured the various components of the renin-angiotensin system and the plasma levels of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (iANF) during room air and hypoxic gas-mixture breathing before and after administration of metoclopramide, a competitive antagonist of dopamine. Seven resting volunteers were studied 1 wk apart under room air and hypoxic conditions (inspired O2 fraction 0.12). During hypoxemia, the release of aldosterone induced by metoclopramide was significantly smaller. This change was associated with a slight increase in iANF and with a decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels, without any change in immunoreactive blood angiotensin I concentrations. Plasma electrolytes and blood acid-base status did not show relevant changes, nor did blood pressure and heart rate. We conclude that the decreased aldosterone concentrations seen under hypoxemia are related to decreased angiotensin II levels. Other influences, such as elevated ANF, may also mediate this effect. 
Selective pulmonary vasodilation by low-dose infusion of adenosine triphosphate in newborn lambs. The systemic and pulmonary vascular effects of adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) were investigated in 12 newborn lambs during normoxia and during alveolar hypoxia (10% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide, and 85% nitrogen). Lambs had catheters in the descending aorta, main pulmonary artery, and were studied after a 3-day recovery. We infused ATP or an equal volume of saline solution (control) into the right atrial line in doses ranging from 0.01 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute. In normoxic lambs, ATP caused a significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance in doses of 0.08 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute, and in systemic vascular resistance in doses of 0.3 to 2.5 mumol/kg per minute. Infusion of ATP in hypoxic lambs caused decreases in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance in all the doses tested. Systemic vascular resistance decreased, and cardiac output and heart rate increased in doses greater than 0.3 mumol/kg per minute in hypoxic lambs during ATP infusion. The effects of ATP in hypoxic lambs were not blocked by propranolol, indomethacin, or theophylline. Plasma ATP levels in left atrial blood samples did not change significantly during the infusion of ATP. We conclude that ATP is a vasodilator in lambs, and its effects are specific for pulmonary circulation at doses of less than or equal to 0.15 mumol/kg per minute. The vasodilator effects of ATP appear to be independent of P1 purinergic and beta-adrenergic mechanisms, and of prostacyclin synthesis. 
Randomized, double-masked study of cyclosporine compared to prednisolone in the treatment of endogenous uveitis. Fifty-six patients with bilateral sight-threatening noninfectious intermediate or posterior uveitis participated in a randomized double-masked study of the use of cyclosporine vs prednisolone in their treatment. Applying the end-point definitions, visual acuity or vitreal haze improved in only 13 of 28 (46%) patients in each group. The macular edema resolved in seven of 15 patients of the cyclosporine-treated group, and in ten of 16 patients of the prednisolone-treated group (P = .376). Patients whose therapies failed both cyclosporine and prednisolone trials were treated with both drugs, which resulted in additional patient improvements. Secondary effects were observed in both therapeutic alternatives, the most notable being alterations in serum creatinine concentration and hypertension with the dosage of cyclosporine used. 
Vipoma of the pancreas complicating ulcerative colitis. We report a case of vipoma of the pancreas in conjunction with ulcerative colitis in a 20-yr-old woman. Twenty months after the onset of ulcerative colitis, the patient complained of watery diarrhea and was found to have an electrolyte disorder. A pancreatic tumor was detected by ultrasonography and computed tomography, along with an elevation of serum vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). The secretory diarrhea diminished dramatically, and the serum VIP level decreased into the normal range immediately after resection of the pancreatic tumor. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a pancreatic vipoma. Despite removal of the vipoma, she underwent restorative proctocolectomy and ileal J-pouch anal anastomosis 2 yr later due to progression of the ulcerative colitis. Postoperative course was uneventful, with excellent functional results. Knowledge of this rare condition accompanying ulcerative colitis may help in the management of the patient with an atypical clinical course. 
Establishment of permanent renal tubule cell lines by infection with the wild-type and a thermosensitive mutant of the simian virus 40. This study summarizes the properties of rabbit renal tubule cell lines transformed by the simian virus 40 (SV40). By infection with the wild type SV40, it was possible to establish three different cell lines exhibiting the main functions of proximal (RC.SV1), thick ascending limb-distal (RC.SV2), and collecting (RC.SV3) tubules. Another cell line infected with a thermosensitive mutant of SV40 (RC.SVtsA58) was highly sensitive to arginine vasopressin when cells were cultured at the restrictive temperature of 39.5 degrees C, suggesting they derived from principal cells of the collecting tubule. 
Hepatocarcinoma in cirrhosis. Is antithrombin III a neoplastic marker? It has been reported that hepatoma (HCC) cells produce abnormal proteins such as erytropietin, fibrinogen, prothrombin, and, recently, antithrombin III (AT III). In a preliminary report, we reported increased AT III levels in patients bearing HCC independent of their clinical liver status. The present study was performed to assess antithrombin III levels and other serological data present in patients with cirrhosis and in patients with cirrhosis and clinical findings of neoplastic disease. In 70 well-matched patients (47 with cirrhosis and 23 with cirrhosis and proven HCC) serum total cholesterol, albumin, prothrombin, alkaline phosphatase, AFP, aminotransferases, and AT III were determined. Together with AFP and alkaline phosphatase, patients with HCC had higher values of AT III (88 +/- 7%) and total cholesterol (184 +/- 17 mg/100 ml), as compared with cirrhotic patients (AT III 56 +/- 3.6%; total cholesterol 113 +/- 5 mg/100 ml) (P less than 0.001). No difference was observed between these two groups for albumin, prothrombin, and aminotransferases. In HCC patients, AT III levels were related to the total cholesterol level (R2 = 0.317), whereas in the cirrhotic patients it correlated with the prothrombin level (R2 = 0.274). These data suggest that in HCC patients a greater rate of synthesis of AT III occurs, whereas in cirrhotic patients lower levels of AT III occur due to impaired synthesis or increased catabolism of the protein. The serial determination of AT III in cirrhotic patients as a means of detecting neoplastic transformation is suggested. 
Hospital mortality and long-term survival after pulmonary resection in the elderly. We have studied the hospital mortality and long-term survival in two groups of patients: those between 50 and 69 years of age (group 1, n = 136) and those older than 70 years of age (group 2, n = 43). The two groups were similar in terms of the distribution of histological type and postsurgical staging. The patients were treated by either lobectomy or pneumonectomy; the lobectomy rate was similar in both groups: 61% and 51% (not significant). Hospital mortality for group 1 was 4.4% and for group 2, 6.9%. Mortality was higher in both groups after pneumonectomy compared with lobectomy, but this was not significant (group 1, 6.2% versus 1.9%; group 2, 9.1% versus 4.7%). Hospital mortality after pulmonary resection was greater in the elderly, but this was not significant (lobectomy: 1.9% [group 1] versus 4.7% [group 2]; pneumonectomy: 6.2% [group 1] versus 9.1% [group 2]. The overall long-term survival at 2 and 4 years was 62.3% and 50.0% for group 1 and 72.5% and 66.6% for group 2. We suggest that the operative risk in the elderly is not prohibitive and the long-term results are acceptable. Patients should not be denied operation on the basis of age alone. 
The treatment of small acoustic tumors: now or later? Prior to the advent of microneurosurgery, the operative mortality for acoustic tumor removal was high and management often consisted of observation until sufficient symptoms warranted removal. The treatment of these tumors has evolved, and recent introduction of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the diagnosis of very small intracanalicular acoustic tumors before hearing has been significantly affected. For such tumors, some surgeons advocate the premicrosurgical philosophy of observation rather than removal. Our results of small acoustic tumor removal with attempt at hearing preservation were reviewed. From 1961 to June 1989, 39 acoustic tumors 0.5 cm or less were removed by the middle fossa approach. Measurable hearing was preserved in 67%, and facial function 1 year postoperatively was normal or nearly normal in 97%. There was no other permanent operative morbidity. Given our results, early surgical removal of small acoustic tumors is advocated. 
Subtotal parathyroidectomy for secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal failure. Twenty-seven patients on chronic haemodialysis and with secondary hyperparathyroidism underwent subtotal parathyroidectomy during the period 1985-1989. The operation was indicated by severe clinical symptoms and evidence of radiological abnormalities not responsive to conservative treatment (low phosphorus diet, phosphate binding substances, oral calcium and vitamin D). If despite intensive medical management, inadequate control of parathyroid hyperplasia continues surgical intervention becomes necessary. Ultra-sonography was performed pre-operatively in all 27 cases and detected 42 of 99 glands (42.5 per cent). Also scintigraphy was carried out in every patient but it gave a relatively low detection rate (24.5 per cent). Surgery was followed by improvement in 20 patients and progression of hyperparathyroidism in seven cases. Three of the seven patients failed to improve after subtotal parathyroidectomy, necessitating a re-intervention; the remaining four responded sufficiently to medical therapy. From our experience we conclude that subtotal parathyroidectomy for renal hyperparathyroidism is recommended. 
Telephone versus face-to-face mode for collecting self-reports of sequences of behavior. This study compared telephone vs face-to-face interviews as ways to collect self-reported sequences of daily activities. Twenty-seven persons with spinal cord injury in a rehabilitation hospital participated. The Self-Observation and Report Technique was used to obtain, in the participants' own words, two reports per week of 24-hour sequences of activities. One report per week was given over the telephone and one in person. Each behavior was coded for activity, assistance, companions, and locations. Nineteen measures assessing independence, level and diversity of activity, mobility, and social contacts were derived from the last four interviews for each participant. Differences in the measures derived from each mode were tested. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the self-reports to data on activities recorded by trained observers. Measures from the two modes did not differ, nor did the percent agreements with observation data. Investigators can use the more convenient and efficient telephone mode with confidence. 
Adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Screening mammography can detect cancer in its early stages, when it is potentially curable. Adjuvant chemotherapy is of major benefit in node-positive patients. It is also beneficial in certain node-negative patients with a high risk of breast cancer recurrence; these patients should be identified and offered adjuvant therapy or enrolled in a clinical trial. 
Surgical management of the conal (supracristal) ventricular septal defect. Surgical management of the conal (supracristal) ventricular septal defect differs significantly from the management of the perimembranous (infracristal) ventricular septal defect. The absence of a portion of the conal septum can lead to prolapse of the right cusp of the aortic valve, which predisposes these patients to aortic insufficiency. Between January 1980 and December 1989, 36 children with conal ventricular septal defect underwent intracardiac repair. Diagnosis was by echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, and intraoperative exploration. Preoperative evaluation showed that 26 patients (72%) had aortic valve prolapse and 16 (44%) had aortic insufficiency. Pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratios ranged from 1:1 to 3.5:1 (mean 2.0:1.0). Ten patients (27%) were believed to have clinical congestive heart failure. Age at the time of operation ranged from 2 weeks to 18 years (mean 5.5 years). Operative exposure was through the pulmonary artery (26), aorta (4), right ventricle (3), or right atrium (3). Simultaneous aortic valve suspension for aortic insufficiency was performed in four patients. Operative survival was 100%. Follow-up is complete in all patients and ranges from 0.5 to 9 years (mean 4.3 years). All patients are in normal sinus rhythm. No residual ventricular septal defects have been identified. Twenty-three of 36 patients (64%) have no evidence of aortic insufficiency; 12 of 36 (33%) have trivial or mild aortic insufficiency. One patient with initial severe aortic insufficiency underwent repeat aortic valvuloplasty 3 years after ventricular septal defect closure and aortic valve suspension. No patients have required aortic valve replacement. Surgical management of the conal ventricular septal defect differs from that of the perimembranous ventricular septal defect in two critical aspects. The operative approach should be through the pulmonary artery. This allows the best exposure of the remaining conal septum and the pulmonary and aortic valve leaflets, facilitating closure of the defect without injury to the valves or conduction system. Conal ventricular septal defects should undergo early closure, regardless of shunt volume, to prevent progressive aortic insufficiency. 
Treatment of cardiogenic shock with the Hemopump left ventricular assist device. A multiinstitutional study is in progress to evaluate the Hemopump in the treatment of cardiogenic shock. Fifty-three patients with refractory cardiogenic shock were selected for Hemopump assistance. The hemodynamic definition of cardiogenic shock included (1) a cardiac index of less than 2.0 L.min-1.m-2, (2) pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of greater than 18 mm Hg, and (3) a systolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg or a left ventricular work index of less than 1,500 g-m.m-2.min-1. The Hemopump was successfully inserted in 41 of 53 patients (77.3%). A significant improvement in the hemodynamic status was seen during Hemopump assistance. A minimal level of hemolysis was observed. No leg ischemia was observed. The 30-day overall survival of the Hemopump group was 31.7%. Criteria establishing indications for use and clinical utility are proposed. We conclude that the Hemopump provides significant hemodynamic support of the patient in cardiogenic shock allowing for recovery from ventricular stunning in marginal ventricles, and that in select patients the Hemopump may offer a major improvement in survival over conventional therapy. 
Relation of symptoms to contractility and defect size in infants with ventricular septal defect. Forty-two infants with a ventricular septal defect (VSD) (21 asymptomatic and 21 symptomatic) were compared with 17 control infants to determine if symptoms of congestive heart failure (i.e., tachypnea/poor growth) were due to depressed contractility or defect size, or both. Echocardiographic indexes of defect size, left ventricular performance (shortening fraction), preload (left ventricular end-diastolic dimension), afterload (left ventricular end-systolic wall stress) and contractility (the relation between velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and wall stress) were measured. Clinical assessment included measurement of weight and respiratory rate. Pulmonary and systemic blood flow were assessed in 17 symptomatic and 3 asymptomatic patients by cardiac catheterization. Although there was no significant difference in age, the symptomatic group had significantly lower weight (5.5 +/- 2.9 vs 7.3 +/- 2.3 kg, p less than 0.05) and a higher respiratory rate (53 +/- 14 vs 43 +/- 6 breaths/min, p less than 0.05), compared with control subjects. The mean pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio in the symptomatic group was 2.9:1. Preload indexed for body surface area was significantly higher in the groups with a VSD compared with control subjects (asymptomatic, 8.5 +/- 1.7 cm/m2; symptomatic, 9.1 +/- 1.7 cm/m2; control subjects, 6.8 +/- 1.1 cm/m2; p less than 0.05). Shortening fraction, afterload and contractility were not significantly different among all groups. A defect size greater than 0.5 cm (or defect size indexed for body surface area greater than 1.8 cm/m2) was predictive of the presence of symptoms. It is concluded that contractility is normal in infants with a VSD. Symptoms may be related to pulmonary congestion. 
Bladder outlet obstruction treated with transurethral ultrasonic aspiration. One-year follow-up on 59 patients. Fifty-nine males with bladder outlet obstruction were treated with transurethral ultrasonic aspiration of the prostate. Utilizing a 26.5F urethral sheath, surgery was accomplished with a 10F, 0-700-micron-vibration-level ultrasonic tip with an excursion rate of 39 kHz. Complete removal of the adenoma was accomplished followed by transurethral electrocautery biopsies of both lateral lobes to compare pathologic specimens. One year follow-up revealed satisfactory voiding patterns in 57 of 59 men (96%). Bladder neck contractures developed in 2 men. Pathologic comparisons showed 100 percent correlation between aspirated and TUR specimens (56 BPH, 3 adenocarcinoma). Forty-seven men were active sexually preoperatively (6 with inflatable penile prostheses). Post ultrasonic aspiration, 46 men had erectile function similar to preoperative levels with 1 patient suffering erectile dysfunction. Forty men (85%) had antegrade ejaculation while 7 (15%) experienced retrograde or retarded ejaculation. No patients were incontinent. 
Histopathology of childhood pneumonia in developing countries. Acute lower respiratory infection in children is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. Viral and bacterial agents incite characteristic host responses at the level of the bronchi, bronchioles, alveolar walls, and air spaces that correlate with the clinical course. A systematic review of histopathologic features will enhance the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms and cofactors that influence the disease process, particularly how tissue injury may be influenced by nutritional status and access to antibiotics. Research priorities include immunologic assessment, micronutrient assays, and standardized autopsies in developing countries. DNA probes for organisms and immunocytochemical identification of cell markers in tissue promise a new era in microscopic visualization of pathogen-host interactions. International collaborative research between ministries of public health and medical universities must be encouraged as a means of providing technical assistance and of advancing new knowledge. Systematic standardized autopsy studies from multiple geographic areas may help define pathologic mechanisms, monitor the natural history of disease, and evaluate interventions in diverse populations. 
Outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction who are ineligible for thrombolytic therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine what proportion of patients with acute myocardial infarction are not eligible for thrombolytic therapy and to assess their natural history. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A large community-based hospital. PATIENTS: All patients with acute myocardial infarction hospitalized during a 27-month period. MEASUREMENTS: Of 1471 patients with acute myocardial infarction, 230 (16%) received thrombolytic therapy according to the protocol and an additional 97 (7%) received nonprotocol thrombolytic therapy, primary coronary balloon angioplasty, or both because of contraindications. The other 1144 patients (78%) did not receive reperfusion therapy. MAIN RESULTS: The patients who did not receive thrombolytic therapy were older, more likely to be women, and more likely to have a history of hypertension, previous myocardial infarction, or chronic angina (all comparisons, P less than 0.002). An average of 1.9 reasons for exclusion were identified per patient among the ineligible patients. Mortality was fivefold higher among ineligible patients (19%; Cl, 16% to 21%) than among protocol-treated patients (4%; Cl, 1% to 6%) (P less than 0.001). In-hospital mortality rates for excluded patients were 28% (Cl, 23% to 32%) in elderly patients (age, greater than 76 years; n = 396); 29% (Cl, 23% to 35%) in patients with stroke or bleeding risk (n = 209); 17% (Cl, 14% to 20%) in patients with delayed presentation (greater than 4 hours after the onset of chest pain; [n = 599]); 14% (Cl, 11% to 16%) in patients with an ineligible electrocardiogram (ECG) (n = 673); and 26% (Cl, 21% to 32%) in patients with a miscellaneous reason for exclusion (n = 243). Independent predictors of increased mortality were: age greater than 76 years, stroke or other bleeding risk, ineligible ECG, or the presence of two or more exclusion criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombolytic therapy is currently used in the United States for only a minority of patients with acute myocardial infarction: those who have low-risk prognostic characteristics. 
Hypercarbic acidosis reduces cardiac resuscitability. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Marked increases in myocardial hypercarbia and acidosis accompany cardiac arrest and resuscitation. To investigate whether hypercarbic acidosis independent of oxygenation is of itself detrimental to cardiac resuscitation, three groups of six Sprague-Dawley rats were ventilated with gas mixtures containing concentrations of inspired CO2 (FICO2) of 0.0, 0.3, or 0.5, with oxygen fractions held constant at 0.5. After 4 mins of ventricular fibrillation, mechanical chest compressions were initiated with a pneumatic thumper; 2 mins later, transthoracic defibrillation was attempted. RESULTS: Each animal ventilated with FICO2 of 0.0 or 0.3 was successfully resuscitated. However, none of the animals ventilated with FICO2 of 0.5, in which aortic pH was less than 6.67 and aortic PCO2 was greater than 200 torr (greater than 26.7 kPa), was resuscitated (p less than .001). This finding contrasted with a second control group of seven identically treated animals which, in the absence of cardiac arrest, demonstrated no adverse effects after ventilation with an FICO2 of 0.5. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in FICO2 to levels of 0.5 under conditions of constant arterial oxygenation and controlled coronary perfusion pressure preclude successful resuscitation in this rodent model of CPR. 
Human papillomavirus type 16 DNA in anal cancers from six different countries. An association between anal squamous cell carcinoma and human papillomavirus (HPV) type 16 DNA has been documented in the UK. If HPV type 16 is an important aetiological factor in the development of this tumour it would be expected to occur in anal cancer tissues from other parts of the world. In this study a series of 173 anal squamous cell carcinoma tissue samples from five centres around the world have been examined by DNA hybridisation for HPV type 16 DNA sequences. HPV type 16 DNA was found in 50 of 173 (29%) of these. The prevalence of HPV associated anal squamous cell carcinoma was significantly lower in tissue from India and South Africa than in the Swiss, Polish, or Brazilian samples. HPV associated anal squamous cell carcinoma does occur in other countries and further investigations of the prevalence of these tumours in association with other HPV types are required. 
An extensive experience with postoperative pain relief using postoperative fentanyl infusion. From October 1, 1987 through December 31, 1989, 517 patients who were undergoing both thoracic and abdominal surgical procedures were treated for postoperative pain with epidural fentanyl citrate infusion under the direction of an anesthesia pain service. Infusion rates of 4 micrograms/mL of solution were essentially the same for all subjects. Sixty-five percent of patients experienced superior pain control without the use of adjunctive analgesia. Twenty-eight percent of subjects achieved satisfactory pain control but required additional low-dose analgesics. Only 7% of patients remained uncomfortable despite additional intravenous narcotic administration. There were no deaths or respiratory arrests. Six percent of patients experienced nausea, and 0.8% of the cohort required catheterization for urinary retention. This technique of postoperative pain control was safe and provided excellent results. Catheter position was a major determinant of the efficacy of the method. 
Adenovirus-mediated transfer of a recombinant alpha 1-antitrypsin gene to the lung epithelium in vivo The respiratory epithelium is a potential site for somatic gene therapy for the common hereditary disorders alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) deficiency and cystic fibrosis. A replication-deficient adenoviral vector (Ad-alpha 1AT) containing an adenovirus major late promoter and a recombinant human alpha 1AT gene was used to infect epithelial cells of the cotton rat respiratory tract in vitro and in vivo. Freshly isolated tracheobronchial epithelial cells infected with Ad-alpha 1AT contained human alpha 1AT messenger RNA transcripts and synthesized and secreted human alpha 1AT. After in vivo intratracheal administration of Ad-alpha 1AT to these rats, human alpha 1AT messenger RNA was observed in the respiratory epithelium, human alpha 1AT was synthesized and secreted by lung tissue, and human alpha 1AT was detected in the epithelial lining fluid for at least 1 week. 
Silent ischemia and severity of pain in acute myocardial infarction. An overall low tendency to complain of pain, due to a low perception of pain, has been suggested in the pathogenesis of silent ischemia, independent of the extent of the diseased coronaries and a history of previous acute myocardial infarction. This hypothesis has been tested indirectly in this retrospective study by comparison of the use of analgesics during admission for a first acute myocardial infarction with the occurrence of silent ischemia at exertion tests four weeks after discharge from hospital. The study did not show a lower use of analgesics in patients with silent ischemia, but this may be due to methodologic problems. Suggestions are given for another study design to overcome these problems. 
Corneal choristoma with microphthalmos. We report two rare cases of corneal choristoma with microphthalmos. In both cases, the whole thickness of the cornea, as well as the anterior chamber and iris, was replaced by cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue. In case 1, diagnosed as dermoid choristoma, the cutaneous tissue contained skin appendages and subcutaneous fibrofatty tissue extended into the vitreous cavity. The fibrous mass in the cavity contained fragments of retina. In case 2, diagnosed as a dermislike choristoma, the cutaneous tissue lacked skin appendages. These choristomatous cutaneous tissues hindered normal growth of ocular structures, resulting in microphthalmos. Use of computed tomography was helpful in evaluating the extent of ocular tissue involvement and accompanying intraocular malformations. 
Radiation-induced meningiomas: experience at the Mount Sinai Hospital and review of the literature. From the records of The Mount Sinai Hospital, seven cases which met established criteria for radiation-induced meningiomas were identified. This represents the largest series of radiogenic meningiomas documented in North America and includes both intracranial and intraspinal tumors. The records and pathological specimens were reviewed and these data analyzed with other cases retrieved from the world literature. This study reveals that radiation-induced meningiomas can be categorized into three groups based on the amount of radiation administered: 1) low dose; 2) moderate dose and miscellaneous; and 3) high dose. The overwhelming majority of cases had received low-dose irradiation (800 rad) to the scalp for tinea capitis and the second largest group resulted from high-dose irradiation for primary brain tumors (greater than 2000 rad). The unique features distinguishing radiation-induced meningiomas from other meningiomas are reviewed. Although histologically atypical tumors were common in this series, overt malignancy was not encountered. The preoperative management of these lesions should include angiography to evaluate for large-vessel occlusive vasculopathy, a known association of meningiomas induced by high-dose irradiation. Given the propensity these tumors possess for recurrence, a wide bony and dural margin is recommended at surgical resection. 
Radical prostatectomy for stage A adenocarcinoma of the prostate: staging errors and their implications for treatment recommendations and disease outcome. Of 148 patients with clinical stage A1 (32) or A2 (116) disease who had radical prostatectomy only 63% and 62%, respectively, had pathological stage A disease. Although 25% of those with clinical stage A1 and 9% of those with clinical stage A2 disease had no cancer at radical prostatectomy, 12% and 29%, respectively, had pathological stage C disease or higher. Clinical Mayo grade 1 was never associated with extracapsular disease but 60% of those with grade 3 or higher tumor did have extracapsular disease. Over-all survival was comparable to the expected survival. Clinical stage A2 cancer was associated with a significantly higher progression rate (when prostate specific antigen values were considered, p = 0.0011) and cancer death rate (p less than 0.045) than stage A1 disease, whereas pathological stage was not significantly related to disease outcome, possibly because of the use of adjuvant treatment (hormonal or radiation) for some patients with pathological stage C or higher disease. The vagaries of clinical staging associated with stage A disease, as well as the previously documented progression on long-term followup (8 to 10 years) in younger (60 years old or less) patients with stage A1 prostate cancer make radical prostatectomy with its limited morbidity an acceptable treatment choice. 
Morphine compared with diamorphine. A comparison of dose requirements and side-effects after hip surgery. The dose requirements and side effects of morphine were compared with those of diamorphine administered by patient-controlled analgesia in 40 patients following elective total hip replacement. Patients were allocated randomly to receive in a double-blind manner either morphine or diamorphine for postoperative pain relief. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to postoperative sedation, nausea, well-being, pain relief and requirements for antiemetic drugs. The dose requirement for diamorphine was approximately 50% of that for morphine. 
The Foot Function Index: a measure of foot pain and disability. A Foot Function Index (FFI) was developed to measure the impact of foot pathology on function in terms of pain, disability and activity restriction. The FFI is a self-administered index consisting of 23 items divided into 3 sub-scales. Both total and sub-scale scores are produced. The FFI was examined for test-retest reliability, internal consistency, and construct and criterion validity. A total of 87 patients with rheumatoid arthritis were used in the study. Test-retest reliability of the FFI total and sub-scale scores ranged from 0.87 to 0.69. Internal consistency ranged from 0.96 to 0.73. With the exception of two items, factor analysis supported the construct validity of the total index and the sub-scales. Strong correlation between the FFI total and sub-scale scores and clinical measures of foot pathology supported the criterion validity of the index. The FFI should prove useful for both clinical and research purposes. 
Role of hepatitis C virus in non-B chronic liver disease. To assess the contribution of the recently identified hepatitis C virus to chronic liver diseases of unknown cause and chronic hepatitis attributed by exclusion to non-A, non-B hepatitis, we tested for antibody to hepatitis C in hepatitis B surface antigen-negative patients with a spectrum of chronic liver diseases. Antibody to hepatitis C virus, a marker of hepatitis C infection, was detected with a first-generation radioimmunoassay at the following frequencies in the following patient groups: 69% of transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis; 53% of non-transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis; 26% of hepatitis B surface antigen-negative hepatocellular carcinoma; 8% of cryptogenic cirrhosis; 5% to 7% of autoimmune chronic liver diseases; 19% of patients with miscellaneous types of chronic liver disease; and 0.67% of healthy controls. Among non-transfusion-associated cases, 81% with a history of intravenous drug use but only 18% with occupational exposure as health workers had antibody to hepatitis C virus. Among cases of hepatocellular carcinoma, 63% of Japanese patients but only 11% of American patients had evidence of hepatitis C infection. Comparison in a subgroup of 79 serum samples of a second-generation radioimmunoassay with the first-generation assay demonstrated a 12% increase in antibody frequency from 30% to 42%. We conclude that hepatitis C plays a substantial role in transfusion-associated and non-transfusion-associated non-A, non-B hepatitis as well as in hepatocellular carcinoma, especially in Japan, a limited role in cryptogenic cirrhosis, and essentially no role in autoimmune chronic liver diseases. Application of more sensitive immunoassays will increase the frequency of antibody seropositivity in all subgroups, but relative distinctions among risk groups are likely to remain. 
Percutaneous ethanol injection therapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. A histopathologic study. Histopathologic examination was done on 18 cases after percutaneous ethanol injection therapy (PEIT) for hepatocellular carcinoma. In eight cases, the lesion was treated by PEIT alone; in the other ten cases, PEIT was combined with transcatheter arterial embolization. The lesion was completely necrotic in 13 cases, 90% necrotic in four cases, and 70% necrotic in the rest. In addition, PEIT seemed to be effective against intercapsular, extracapsular, and vascular invasions. In the four cases of incomplete necrosis, the viable cancer tissue remained in small tumor nodules around the main tumor, in portions isolated by septa, or along the edge of the lesion. Therefore, ethanol should be injected not only into the center of the lesion, but also into sites close to its edge. Ethanol did not damage noncancerous liver parenchyma distant from injected sites. Local dissemination of the cancer cells was not found in any case. Therefore, PEIT seems to be a valuable therapy and may be an alternative to surgery in some cases. 
Contact-tip Nd:YAG laser applications: squamous nasal papillomatosis. Concurrent use of nasal endoscopes and the contact-tip Nd:YAG laser provides the necessary visualization and control for treating a widespread condition such as nasal papillomatosis. This laser should decrease the likelihood of spread to other sites within the patient's upper respiratory tract or to attending health care personnel. 
Pressure-diameter relationships of the upper airway in awake supine subjects. In awake supine normal subjects, dimensional changes of the oropharyngeal airway were measured during exposure to negative intraluminal pressures. The pressure was generated 1) "actively" by subjects inspiring against an externally occluded airway or 2) "passively" by external suction at the mouth during voluntary glottic closure with no inspiratory effort. Airway dimensions were imaged with X-ray fluoroscopy and anteroposterior diameters measured at levels corresponding to cervical vertebra 3 and 4 (C3 and C4). Cephalad axial displacement of the hyoid bone (CDHY) was also measured. During the "active" maneuver, airway diameters and position were maintained at resting levels despite airway pressure up to -15 cmH2O. In contrast, during the passive maneuver at -15 cmH2O, C3 was only 15 +/- 9% and C4 only 47 +/- 8% of control; CDHY was 5.6 +/- 1.8 mm. In three subjects airway wall apposition occurred and persisted until an active inspiratory effort. We conclude that, in the absence of inspiratory effort, negative oropharyngeal airway pressures result in marked narrowing and cephalad displacement of the upper airway, even during wakefulness. Therefore, our data suggest that the complex interaction of upper airway and thoracic muscle activity is critical in determining the effective compliance and patency of the upper airway, which is readily collapsible even in normal subjects. 
Human immunodeficiency virus induction of malignant transformation in human B lymphocytes. Aggressive B-cell lymphomas are occurring with increasing incidence among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Several lines of evidence implicate both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and c-myc activation in the pathogenesis of a major subset of these tumors. These observations prompted our investigation of interactions among EBV, c-myc, and HIV in primary B cells. We show that nonimmortalized peripheral B lymphocytes from EBV-seropositive, HIV-seronegative donors can be infected by HIV and that a subset of these lymphocytes become transformed. Malignant transformation was documented by several criteria. These cells displayed altered growth properties, propagating in 1% serum and cloning in soft agar, and formed invasive tumors of Burkitt lymphoma phenotype after subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Such cells revealed marked enhancement of EBV DNA and RNA and of endogenous c-myc transcripts and protein. HIV-1 infection of already immortalized B-cell lines led to a similar upregulation of EBV and c-myc transcripts. These data indicate that HIV has properties of a transforming retrovirus, as it mediates two events linked to B-cell neoplasia: deregulation of c-myc and activation of EBV. They also raise the possibility of a role for HIV, apart from induction of immune suppression, in the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphoma in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome. 
Hepatitis C in patients undergoing liver transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) among patients undergoing liver transplantation and the relation between anti-HCV and post-transplant hepatitis. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort. PATIENTS: Serum samples from 128 patients who underwent liver transplantation. Sixty-six patients who had 6 months of follow-up and for whom both pretransplant and post-transplant serum samples were available were included in a study to asses the relation between anti-HCV and post-transplant hepatitis. MEASUREMENTS: Sera were tested for anti-HCV using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and, if positive, two confirmatory tests were done. Patients had a biopsy every week until two specimens showed no abnormal findings. MAIN RESULTS: Only patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis (15 of 30; 50%), alcoholic cirrhosis (7 of 19; 37%), and chronic hepatitis B infection (3 of 11; 27%) were anti-HCV positive. No patient with another form of chronic liver disease or with acute liver failure due to non-A, non-B hepatitis was anti-HCV positive. After transplantation, loss of anti-HCV was frequent and acquisition rare. Hepatitis developed in the graft in 17% of patients, but the incidence was similar among anti-HCV negative and anti-HCV-positive patients. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatitis C virus is a common cause of chronic liver disease in patients requiring liver transplantation, but anti-HCV is rarely found in patients with acute liver failure. Previous HCV infection, based on detection of anti-HCV, is not an independent risk factor for post-transplant hepatitis. 
Microscopic activity in ulcerative colitis: what does it mean? To determine the prognostic importance of microscopic rectal inflammation we followed up 82 patients (aged 21 to 78 years, 44 men) with chronic quiescent ulcerative colitis over 12 months. At trial entry each patient underwent a rectal biopsy and sections were graded independently by two histopathologists. A chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of varying severity was present in all biopsy specimens, and 58% had crypt architectural irregularities. In addition, 32% had evidence of acute inflammatory activity: 28% acute inflammatory cell infiltrate, 11% crypt abscesses, and 22% mucin depletion. Agreement between the two histopathologists for the presence of each of these features was 94% (90-98%). During the 12 month follow up 27 patients (33%) relapsed after a mean interval of 18 weeks (range 3-44 weeks). Relapse rates were unrelated to duration or extent of disease or to the type of maintenance drug treatment. In patients with an acute inflammatory cell infiltrate 52% relapsed, whereas in the absence of such an infiltrate only 25% relapsed (p = 0.02). Similarly, relapse rates were higher in the presence of crypt abscesses (78% v 27%, p less than 0.005), mucin depletion (56% v p less than 0.02), and breaches in the surface epithelium (75% v 31%, p = 0.1). The presence of a chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate or crypt architectural irregularities, however, bore no relation to the frequency of colitis relapse. 
Mechanisms of disease in Hantavirus infection: pathophysiology of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) is an acute viral disease that occurs over wide areas of Europe and Asia. Hantaviruses are the cause of this syndrome. The hallmark of HFRS is the triad of fever, hemorrhage, and renal failure. In its severe form it is associated with significant mortality. The syndrome evolves through five phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic, and convalescent. The central physiologic derangement in HFRS is vascular dysfunction, manifested by impaired vascular tone and increased vascular permeability. The systemic effects of this dysfunction account for the occurrence of hypotension and shock, while local effects are probably important in the development of renal failure. Shock in HFRS has distributive and oligemic features, while renal failure has features of acute tubular necrosis. Hemorrhage is a consequence of vascular injury and a deficit of functional platelets. Vascular and platelet dysfunction are both compounded by uremia. Disseminated intravascular coagulation contributes to hemorrhage in some patients. Although hantaviruses are infectious for endothelial cells and may cause direct injury, a large body of evidence suggests that immune mechanisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of HFRS. 
Prognostic factors of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in childhood. An International Society of Pediatric Oncology study. Pretreatment characteristics of 57 patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) registered by the International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) between January 1975 and December 1983 were identified to perform a prognostic factor study. Living status and disease-free survival (DFS) time were assessed for all patients on January 1, 1988. By multi-variate analyses, lymph node involvement (P = 0.0003) and tumor invasiveness (P = 0.007) were identified as the most significant covariates correlated with survival. A model including N stage (P = 0.001) and age (P = 0.03) was selected for predicting DFS rates. Children between 5 and 10 years of age had better DFS rates than those younger than 5 years of age or those older than 10 years of age. The authors suggest a prognostic classification that could allow treatment to be adjusted according to clinical staging. 
Blood pressure during sleep: antihypertensive medication. To investigate whether excessive reduction of blood pressure (BP) by antihypertensive medications correlates with myocardial infarction, especially during sleep in elderly patients, we used telemetry and cuvette dye-dilution methods to assess the direct BP and the hemodynamics of 68 inpatients with essential hypertension during wakefulness and sleep. There were 25 patients greater than or equal to 60 years old (OH-group) and 43 were less than or equal to 59 years old (YH-group). Of the OH-group, 36% showed high BP during the day, with marked decreases (minimum BP less than 110/70 mm Hg) during sleep. Average cardiac index (CI) of the OH-group was low during wakefulness and extremely low during slow-wave sleep. Changes of mean BP in the OH-group correlated with changes in total peripheral vascular resistance index (TPRI) during sleep, but this correlation was not observed in the YH-group. The antihypertensive effects on nocturnal BP of the various medications was: central adrenergic inhibitors less than or equal to beta blockers with intrinsic sympathomimetic activity less than or equal to alpha (alpha beta) blockers less than or equal to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors less than or equal to calcium antagonists. Because BP and CI were found to be very low and TPRI seems to play an important role in BP regulation in sleeping elderly patients, excessive antihypertensive medication may be harmful to this subgroup. However, because the effects on nocturnal BP differ among various antihypertensive treatments, further research is required on the relation between antihypertensive medication and the hemodynamics of sleeping elderly hypertensive patients. 
Changes in hepatic haemodynamics and hepatic perfusion index during the growth and development of hypovascular HSN sarcoma in rats. Experimental liver tumours were induced in the Hooded Lister rat by the intraportal inoculation of 10(6) HSN sarcoma cells. The hepatic perfusion index was raised 10 days after the inoculation of cells (at the micrometastatic stage) and when overt tumour was present 20 days after inoculation. Overt tumours were hypovascular compared with normal liver. Portal venous flow and portal venous inflow fell significantly when the hepatic perfusion index was increased, but hepatic arterial flow did not alter. Portal vascular resistance and splanchnic vascular resistance were both increased in tumour-bearing animals but portal pressure, arteriosystemic shunting and portosystemic shunting did not increase significantly at any stage during the growth of hepatic tumour. These findings confirm that the hepatic perfusion index can be elevated in the presence of both micrometastic and overt hepatic tumour and that the changes are not due to either arteriosystemic shunting or mechanical portal venous obstruction. 
Gliomatosis peritonei with malignant transformation: a case report and review of the literature. Gliomatosis peritonei is the implantation of glial tissue within the peritoneal cavity associated with ovarian teratomas. Previous reports have emphasized improved outcomes when these implants are found to be mature, even if the ovarian component is immature. A 16-year-old female with grade 3 immature teratoma was found on two subsequent laparotomies to have extensive peritoneal implantation of mature glial tissue. More than 5 years after the original surgery she was found to have a malignant abdominal glial neoplasm. This case illustrates a rare finding of malignant transformation of previously mature gliomatosis peritonei. 
Limited benefit of atropine as premedication for colonoscopy. A prospective double-blind trial was performed comparing atropine (0.5 mg) by slow intravenous administration to placebo as premedication for colonoscopy, to assess the possible beneficial effects of this vagolytic agent on the performance and safety of the procedure. A total of 77 patients was randomly assigned to receive atropine (38 patients) or placebo (39 patients) before colonoscopy in conjunction with our standard initial medications for conscious sedation (meperidine, 0.4 mg/kg and midazolam, 0.03 mg/kg). Total procedure time was 31 min for the atropine group and 35 min for the placebo group (p greater than 0.05), and there was no overall difference in the total amount of intra-procedural medications required. No statistically significant differences were observed relative to the number or severity of vagal episodes, and neither the endoscopist nor the patients noted any differences in the ease or tolerance of the procedure (p greater than 0.05). Although these results fail to demonstrate a significant benefit of atropine when given routinely as premedication for colonoscopy, this study does not rule out the potential usefulness of atropine in counteracting vagal episodes when they occur. 
Effects of cytokine combinations on acute phase protein production in two human hepatoma cell lines. We evaluated the effects of binary combinations of four cytokines on production of the positive acute phase proteins alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, haptoglobin and fibrinogen, and the negative acute phase proteins albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in two human hepatoma cell lines. The effects of the cytokine combinations on the five proteins varied; each protein exhibited a unique and specific pattern of response to the cytokine combinations. In Hep G2 cells, antichymotrypsin was induced by all four cytokines, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta 1 alone, and their effects in binary combinations could be attributed to additive or minimally synergistic interactions. Fibrinogen was induced only by IL-6 and this induction was inhibited by IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha or transforming growth factor beta 1. Haptoglobin was also induced only by IL-6, but TNF-alpha was the only cytokine that inhibited this induction at all concentrations of IL-6. Each of the four cytokines alone down regulated production of AFP and albumin. However, binary combinations of the four cytokines were simply additive, for the most part, in inhibiting AFP production, whereas the inhibitory effects of combinations of cytokines on albumin production differed significantly from simple additive effects. These observations, taken together with studies of effects of cytokine combinations on other acute phase proteins, indicate that the various acute phase proteins respond differently to different combinations of cytokines and that the potential exists for highly specific regulation of synthesis of individual plasma proteins by cytokine interactions. These findings imply that the acute phase response in vivo represents the integrated sum of multiple, separately regulated changes in gene expression. 
Anal tonometry: a quick method of anal manometry. Evaluation of anal sphincter tonic activity is important in the proctologic clinic. However, manometric techniques are expensive, complex, and only available in some centers. Because there is often an in-office need for having objective measurements of anal tonic activity, in our clinic we introduced a simple method for measurement of anal pressures. This method is based on the flow of air in an open circuit by using a rubber probe with a side opening at one end. Pressure is assessed by an ordinary manometric gauge for arterial pressure. With this simple instrument, the following parameters are measured: 1) anal resting pressure, 2) squeeze pressure, 3) functional length of the anal canal, and 4) descent of the perineum on staining. After testing the technique in 100 healthy persons, it was applied to 130 patients with several proctologic disorders. Differences in pressures were found between controls and patients with anal fissure (high resting pressures), and patients with anal incontinence (low resting and/or squeeze pressures). A correlation was also found between the descending perineum measured by this method and by defecography. This simple instrument is useful in the office as the first approach to the function of the anal sphincters and the pelvic floor. Nowadays, so-called anal tonometry is part of the proctologic examination in our department, because it is simple, reliable, and takes only a few minutes. 
Verification of a new clinicopathologic staging system for colorectal adenocarcinoma. Rectal adenocarcinoma is said to have a poorer outcome than colon adenocarcinoma when compared on the basis of Dukes' staging. However a new staging system, determined by a multivariate analysis of 147 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, has revealed three other variables significantly related to outcome. Therefore this study analyzed the authors' experience with colonic carcinoma during the same time period as they had studied for rectal carcinoma to determine whether the new staging system is valid for colon carcinoma as well, and, if so, to compare the outcome of patients with colon and rectal carcinoma on the basis of this new staging. A total of 603 patients with 611 colonic adenocarcinoma were operated on at the University of Chicago Medical Center between 1965 and 1981. Two hundred seventy-nine adenocarcinomas (45.7%) were located proximal to the splenic flexure and 332 (54.3%) were located between the splenic flexure and the rectosigmoid. Four hundred sixty-two patients underwent segmental colectomy, 46 subtotal colectomy, 26 total colectomy, 18 proctocolectomy, 5 abdominal-perineal resection, 1 appendectomy, while 20 had local excision of the tumor through colotomy and 25 had permanent diverting stoma as the only procedure. The operative mortality rate was 6.1% in the whole group, but was only 2.7% in the group of potentially curable patients. Complete follow-up was obtained in all patients. To validate a previous staging system for Dukes' B and C rectal adenocarcinoma, the authors investigated the correlation between 5-year survival for colonic carcinoma patients and all relevant variables that they had considered potentially meaningful in the previous study with rectal adenocarcinoma. The resulting multivariate analysis using Cox regression showed that the four variables found previously to be significantly related to outcome for rectal adenocarcinoma patients (stage, race, tumor morphology, and vascular and/or lymphatic microinvasion) were the only four variables significantly (p less than 0.05) associated with outcome for colonic adenocarcinoma patients. In addition, by using the results of their previous staging system for rectal adenocarcinoma patients, they 'predicted' the 5-year survival rates of the colon adenocarcinoma patients, divided in 16 staging subgroups. In subgroups of at least 15 patients, the rectal staging system predicted the outcome to within 1 to 6 percentage points of the observed outcome of the colonic adenocarcinoma patients. Thus this study validates this staging system, incorporating stage, race, tumor morphology, and microinvasion to predict 5-year survival rate more accurately than Dukes' staging alone for both colon and rectal adenocarcinoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Acute twin-twin transfusion: a possible mechanism for brain-damaged survivors after intrauterine death of a monochorionic twin. Intrauterine death of one twin in monochorionic pregnancies is associated with increased mortality and morbidity for the survivor. This has been attributed to the consequences of intrauterine disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) initiated by the dead twin. We describe a case in which the fetal cerebral and renal lesions typically found in survivors occurred without any derangement in coagulation. Instead, acute twin-twin transfusion was suggested by the presence of severe anemia in the surviving fetus at delivery. We suggest that the lesions frequently found in the survivors are often due to acute hemodynamic and ischemic changes resulting from acute twin-twin transfusion at the time of intrauterine death, rather than to late-onset DIC. This hypothesis has an important implication for future management: Intervention must occur before intrauterine death if neurologic sequelae in the survivor are to be prevented. 
A critical review of the relationship between impaired fibrinolysis and myocardial infarction. To explore the relationship between impaired fibrinolysis and myocardial infarction, we conducted a literature search and reviewed the published data. The results indicate that myocardial infarction has a significant influence on fibrinolytic activity and that impaired fibrinolysis is more frequent in patients who have had a myocardial infarction than in healthy control subjects. Prospective cohort studies indicate that tests for global fibrinolytic activity are not of prognostic value for first or recurrent myocardial infarction. However, high levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor and low levels of tissue plasminogen activator activity were associated with an increased risk of reinfarction in survivors of a first myocardial infarction. Whether this relationship between impaired fibrinolysis and reinfarction is causal or coincidental is unclear. There is evidence that impairment of fibrinolytic activity is more marked in patients with myocardial infarction who have minimal coronary atherosclerosis than in those who have marked atherosclerosis, suggesting that impaired fibrinolytic activity might be of pathogenetic importance in this small subgroup of patients. 
Phosphorus metabolites in the human placenta estimated in vivo by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Normal human placental metabolism has been studied in vivo by image localised 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 13 women with anterior placentas; five, however, were too fat for useful spectral signals to be obtained. Magnetic resonance spectra of good quality which were considered to have arisen from the placenta were obtained from seven women with uncomplicated pregnancies (median gestational age 35 weeks, range 28-39). One other woman had a twin pregnancy in which one fetus had died a few days before. The phosphodiester signal from the placenta of the dead fetus was outside the 95% confidence intervals for normal placentas, suggesting that this technique may potentially be useful in the assessment of placental function. 
Caffeine clearance by enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique: a simple, inexpensive, and useful indicator of liver function. The clinical value and sensitivity of serum caffeine clearance measurement has been evaluated as an indicator of hepatic disease. After a 17 hour caffeine exclusion period, 300 mg of caffeine citrate was administered orally to the study subjects. Serum samples were taken four and 16 hours later. Serum caffeine concentrations were measured using an enzyme multiplied immunoassay technique (EMIT) and a clearance value derived. Conventional liver function tests were measured at the same time. A total of 103 subjects attending the medical unit in a district general hospital were studied. Twenty one had alcoholic liver disease, 11 non-alcoholic cirrhosis, nine non-cirrhotic liver disease, 21 suspected liver disease, six hepatic tumours, and 35 were hospital and normal control subjects. Caffeine clearance values were lowest in subjects with alcoholic liver disease (median 0.19 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-0.61 ml/min/kg) and significantly reduced in all subjects with liver disease (median 0.32 ml/min/kg, range 0.04-2.68 ml/min/kg) compared with control subjects (median 1.27 ml/min/kg, p less than 0.001). In subjects with suspected liver disease subsequently shown to have another explanation for abnormal liver function test results, caffeine clearance values were normal (median 1.31 ml/min/kg, range 0.23-2.64 ml/min/kg) and significantly different, p less than 0.001, from those of subjects with liver disease. Serum albumen values were not different for these latter two groups. Using a cut off value of 0.86 ml/min/kg, caffeine clearance measurement was 100% sensitive for alcoholic liver disease and 89% sensitive for all liver disease. The respective sensitivities for conventional liver function test measurement were 76% and 83%. In the suspected liver disease group, caffeine clearance was abnormal in only 24%, conventional liver function tests were abnormal in 95%. 
Efficacy of multiple balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedures. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators. To determine the efficacy of a second balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedure in comparison with the original procedure, 47 patients (18 men, 29 women; mean age 77 +/- 10 years) who underwent two balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedures over a mean interval of 6.4 months between procedures (range 2 days to 15 months) were retrospectively examined. The mean pressure gradient across the aortic valve was significantly higher before the first than before the second valvuloplasty procedure (62 +/- 21 vs. 53 +/- 21 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and after the first compared with after the second procedure (32 +/- 13 vs. 28 +/- 14 mm Hg; p less than 0.05). The cardiac output and stroke volume after the first procedure were significantly greater than the values for these variables after the second procedure (4.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.1 liters/min; p less than 0.05; and 54 +/- 17 vs. 47 +/- 15 ml/beat; p less than 0.05, respectively). There were no significant differences in the change observed in any variable between the first and second procedures. At a mean follow-up interval of 5.3 months (range 6 days to 15 months) after the second procedure 18 (38%) of the 47 patients had died, 12 (25%) required surgical valve replacement and 4 (8%) required a third valvuloplasty procedure. Overall, 31 (66%) of 47 patients met clinical failure end points after the second procedure. Three patients had two failure end points. The 47 patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the interval between valvuloplasty procedures. 
In situ hybridization analysis of human papillomavirus DNA in oral mucosal lesions. Commercial biotinylated DNA probes specific for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6 and 11; 16 and 18; and 31, 33, and 35 were used for in situ hybridization analysis of 105 oral mucosal specimens from 5 cases of verruca vulgaris, 15 cases of condyloma acuminatum, 30 cases of squamous papilloma, 20 cases of hyperkeratosis/acanthosis, 15 cases of epithelial dysplasia, 5 cases of carcinoma in situ, and 15 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Positive hybridization signals were found in 26 specimens (24.8%). Only HPV-6/11 was detected. HPV DNA occurred significantly more often (p less than 0.005, chi-square analysis) in condyloma acuminatum (100%) and verruca vulgaris (100%) than squamous papilloma (13.3%), hyperkeratotic/acanthotic lesions (10%), and malignant and premalignant lesions (0%). The tongue (19.1%) and labial epithelium (17.1%) were infected most frequently. Nuclear reaction products indicating HPV infection were associated primarily with koilocytes. These results demonstrate the usefulness of commercial biotinylated probes for HPV DNA analysis in routine paraffin-embedded lesion specimens. They confirm HPV involvement in benign lesions of the oral mucosa but fail to associate HPV infection with oral cancer and precancer. 
Unusual presentation of cutaneous metastatic malignant melanoma. This report describes an unusual presentation of cutaneous metastases suspected to have occurred through lymphatic spread in a patient with malignant melanoma. Punctate papular skin lesions correlated histologically with small tumor foci in the papillary dermis. 
Nocturnal nasal ventilation for treatment of patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure. We reviewed the Mayo Clinic experience with nocturnal nasal ventilation (NNV) and retrospectively assessed the clinical benefits, patient compliance, and complications. NNV had been instituted in 26 patients with daytime hypercapnia and nocturnal hypoventilation due to neuromuscular diseases or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. After initiation of NNV, 21 of 26 patients continued to use this treatment regularly (81% compliance rate) and considered their life-style improved. In this subset of patients, the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide during unassisted breathing decreased from 64 +/- 13 to 51 +/- 7 mm Hg, and the arterial partial pressure of oxygen increased from 58 +/- 12 to 68 +/- 8 mm Hg. No significant change was noted in the forced vital capacity or maximal respiratory pressures. Four of the five patients in whom NNV had been discontinued cited discomfort related to the mask or severity and poor prognosis of the underlying illness as reasons for cessation of treatment. We conclude that NNV is well tolerated by most patients and may improve alveolar ventilation and arterial oxygenation in patients with chronic respiratory failure. 
Histologic characteristics of carotid artery plaque. Carotid plaque characteristics associated with the production of symptoms were identified with quantification of carotid plaque constituents in high-grade stenotic asymptomatic (n = 8) and symptomatic (n = 44) plaques. Asymptomatic plaques contained significantly more fibrous/collagen material (88%) than symptomatic plaques (66%) (p less than 0.05). Hemorrhage constituted 2% and 1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic plaques, respectively. The predominant nonfibrous material was a pink amorphous material mixed with cholesterol, which composed 7% of asymptomatic and 27% of symptomatic plaques (p less than 0.05). No relationship was found between plaque composition and the number of ipsilateral ischemic neurologic events, nor was there evidence of a healing process. B-mode ultrasound scanning had a sensitivity of 94% in identifying plaque with greater than 80% fibrous content. We believe that plaque composition may be a useful discriminating factor in selecting asymptomatic patients for carotid endarterectomy. 
Mitral valve replacement in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome. Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome is an eosinophil-mediated tissue injury causing multiple organ failure. Cardiac manifestations include subendocardial fibrosis, thrombus leading to peripheral emboli, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and valvar dysfunction. This article describes a patient with the syndrome and reviews surgical experience with valve replacement and long-term prognosis. 
Current practices for treatment of dysentery in rural Bangladesh. A rural area of Bangladesh with a population of 191,000 had 643 health care providers, of whom 324 (50%) practiced allopathic (Western) medicine, 152 (24%) were spiritualists, 109 (17%) were herbalists, and 58 (9%) were homeopaths. Two hundred eight (64%) of the allopaths had no formal training, and only 18 (6%) were graduates of medical school. In a community-based study of 480 children with bloody diarrhea and 480 children with nonbloody diarrhea, allopathic treatment was the most common care provided. Furazolidone and metronidazole were the two most commonly prescribed drugs, given to 26% and 23% of children, respectively, who were seen by a practitioner. Only 25% of children had received oral rehydration therapy. We conclude that in this region of Bangladesh care of acute diarrhea is provided mostly by private medical practitioners who have little or no training; that such care currently is largely irrational; and that the provision of rational care will require the development of simple algorithms that these practitioners can implement for treatment of this disease. 
The otolaryngologic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): a clinical investigation of 225 patients using ambulatory 24-hour pH monitoring and an experimental investigation of the role of acid and pepsin in the development of laryngeal injury. Occult (silent) gastroesophageal reflux disease (GER, GERD) is believed to be an important etiologic factor in the development of many inflammatory and neoplastic disorders of the upper aerodigestive tract. In order ot test this hypothesis, a human study and an animal study were performed. The human study consisted primarily of applying a new diagnostic technique (double-probe pH monitoring) to a population of otolaryngology patients with GERD to determine the incidence of overt and occult GERD. The animal study consisted of experiments to evaluate the potential damaging effects of intermittent GER on the larynx. Two hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with otolaryngologic disorders having suspected GERD evaluated from 1985 through 1988 are reported. Ambulatory 24-hour intraesophageal pH monitoring was performed in 197; of those, 81% underwent double-probe pH monitoring, with the second pH probe being placed in the hypopharynx at the laryngeal inlet. Seventy percent of the patients also underwent barium esophagography with videofluoroscopy. The patient population was divided into seven diagnostic subgroups: carcinoma of the larynx (n = 31), laryngeal and tracheal stenosis (n = 33), reflux laryngitis (n = 61), globus pharyngeus (n = 27), dysphagia (n = 25), chronic cough (n = 30), and a group with miscellaneous disorders (n = 18). The most common symptoms were hoarseness (71%), cough (51%), globus (47%), and throat clearing (42%). Only 43% of the patients had gastrointestinal symptoms (heartburn or acid regurgitation). Thus, by traditional symptomatology, GER was occult or silent in the majority of the study population. Twenty-eight patients (12%) refused or could not tolerate pH monitoring. Of the patients undergoing diagnostic pH monitoring, 62% had abnormal esophageal pH studies, and 30% demonstrated reflux into the pharynx. The results of diagnostic pH monitoring for each of the subgroups were as follows (percentage with abnormal studies): carcinoma (71%), stenosis (78%), reflux laryngitis (60%), globus (58%), dysphagia (45%), chronic cough (52%), and miscellaneous (13%). The highest yield of abnormal pharyngeal reflux was in the carcinoma group and the stenosis group (58% and 56%, respectively). By comparison, the diagnostic barium esophagogram with videofluoroscopy was frequently negative. The results were as follows: esophagitis (18%), reflux (9%), esophageal dysmotility (12%), and stricture (3%). All of the study patients were treated with antireflux therapy. Follow-up was available on 68% of the patients and the mean follow-up period was 11.6 +/- 12.7 months.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). 
Alcohol ablation of atrioventricular conduction Transcoronary ablation of atrioventricular conduction by dehydrated alcohol was attempted in 14 patients with refractory atrial arrhythmias. Alcohol (0.5 or 1.0 ml) was delivered after selective catheterisation of the atrioventricular nodal artery in the 10 patients in whom the artery could be identified by cineangiography. The other four patients underwent electrical ablation when the nodal artery could not be catheterised. Temporary atrioventricular block induced by dilute contrast and cold saline (0.9%) confirmed that the catheter was in the correct position before the alcohol was delivered. In all 10 patients complete atrioventricular block developed after alcohol ablation. The block persisted in all four patients given 1.0 ml alcohol but not in four of the six given 0.5 ml. The mean (SD) creatine kinase (MB fraction) at four to six hours after ablation was 76.5 (49.5) IU after 1.0 ml and 75.5 (43.1) IU after 0.5 ml alcohol (normal less than 20 IU). The overall success rate of alcohol ablation in the whole group on an "intention to treat" basis was 43%. The procedure was a technical success in six of the 10 patients in whom the nodal artery was identified. Transcoronary alcohol ablation of atrioventricular conduction should be considered in patients in whom electrical techniques have been unsuccessful. 
Inadequate immune response among public safety workers receiving intradermal vaccination against hepatitis B--United States, 1990-1991. The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommends that hepatitis B vaccine be administered by the intramuscular (IM) route (1). However, since November 1990, public safety departments have reported to CDC at least four instances of poor immune response among public safety workers vaccinated against hepatitis B by the intradermal (ID) route of administration. 
Itraconazole in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis. Sixteen patients with coccidioidomycosis were treated with itraconazole for one year. Sixteen suffered from pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, two of them had associated mediastinal lesions, and one suffered from skin coccidioidomycosis. The daily dose used was 400 mg during the one-year period. Patients were clinically evaluated every month and tested for mycosis every three months. All patients except for one showed negative cultures on the third month after treatment began. Effectiveness achieved was excellent in eight patients (50 percent); a very good response was found in seven patients (44 percent); no response was seen in one patient (6 percent). There were four (25 percent) relapses and one dropout. Side effects seen were high blood pressure (19 percent) and lower limb edema (6 percent), which was temporary and at no time required discontinuing the drug therapy. We believe that itraconazole is an effective drug to treat coccidioidomycosis with a wide safety margin. It is well tolerated, and the incidence of relapses was low. 
Factors associated with chronic lung disease in preterm infants. Among 659 infants of 30 weeks' gestation or less born in a regional perinatal centre between 1983 and 1989, 195 were ventilated for four days or more and survived to 28 days, and 87 of these developed chronic lung disease. There was a sevenfold increase in the annual incidence of chronic lung disease over time. During the same period there were significant increases in the number of infants who survived, the incidence of septicaemia, and the use of parenteral lipid emulsions. Chronic lung disease was significantly associated with low birth weight, shorter gestation, duration of ventilation, vaginal delivery, sepsis, and the use of lipid. Respiratory and physiological measurements at 96 hours were significantly worse in infants who subsequently developed chronic lung disease. Initial logistic regression showed that gestation, arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), and ventilation rate at 96 hours; and birth in 1988 or 1989, were independently associated with chronic lung disease, but when septicaemia and use of lipid during the first 21 days were included, only gestational age (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.49 to 0.81 for each week) and use of lipid (odds ratio 8.1, 95% CI, 2.32 to 28.0) remained significantly associated with chronic lung disease. The observed increase in incidence of chronic lung disease in this population was associated with earlier use of parenteral lipids in infants of very low gestation rather than with changes in population, survival, or ventilator treatment of respiratory distress syndrome. 
Left main coronary artery aneurysm in association with severe atherosclerosis: a case report and review of the literature. Aneurysms of the coronary arteries occur in from 0.3% to 4.9% of angiograms. Only 12 cases of left main artery (LMA) aneurysms have been reported. Of these, seven were associated with atherosclerosis in patients more than 56 years old. This report details the case of a 39-year-old patient with a large LMA aneurysm associated with atherosclerosis. 
Evaluation of ultrasonically guided biopsies of mediastinal masses. Eighty patients with roentgenographic evidence of mediastinal abnormalities were examined with ultrasonography. Fifty-four lesions were malignant, and 26 lesions were benign. The histologic diagnoses were confirmed by ultrasonically guided fine needle aspiration/cutting needle (Tru-Cut) biopsy, surgical specimens, or transbronchial biopsy. There were no unique ultrasonographic features for diagnosis of specific tumors. Ultrasonically guided aspiration biopsies (UGAB) were performed in 44 of the malignant lesions and in 14 of the benign lesions (nine of the noncystic lesions and five of the cystic lesions). Cytologic diagnosis of malignancies was obtained in 34 (77 percent) of these 44 malignancies; however, accurate histologic classifications of malignancies were achieved in only 24 (55 percent). Accurate diagnoses were achieved in only three (33 percent) of the nine noncystic benign lesions. Ultrasonically guided cutting biopsies (UGCB) were performed in 24 malignant and five benign lesions. All attempts yielded satisfactory specimens for histologic diagnosis. Using UGAB and UGCB together, a positive diagnosis was achieved in 89 percent (39/44) of the malignancies, and accurate histologic diagnosis was achieved in 89 percent and 78 percent (7/9) in malignant and benign noncystic lesions, respectively. Correct histologic diagnosis with UGAB alone is lower in thymoma (55 percent [6/11]) and lymphoma (30 percent [3/10]) but higher in lung cancer (67 percent [8/12]) and metastatic cancer (78 percent [7/9]). There were no complications in this series. We conclude that ultrasonography with UGAB has a high diagnostic yield in diagnosing mediastinal tumors, and UGCB is necessary for thymic tumors, lymphoma, and benign lesions. 
Intrathecal phenol rhizotomy for management of pain in recurrent unresectable carcinoma of the rectum. The medical records of 11 patients with recurrent unresectable adenocarcinoma of the rectum who had intrathecal phenol block for the management of intractable pain were reviewed. There were seven patients with pelvic and four with combined pelvic and perineal recurrences. Five patients had sacral involvement by tumor. Six patients had received prior irradiation. Three patients had good, three had fair and five patients had poor results after phenol rhizotomy. Patients with good results had relief for a median of three months. The over-all survival rate after phenol injection was three months. Phenol rhizotomy is indicated for the relief of intractable pain secondary to recurrent unresectable carcinoma of the rectum in carefully selected patients. 
Etretinate and visual function: a 1-year follow-up study. Concern has been expressed in the literature that the drug etretinate may be potentially retinotoxic. Four patients are reported who have received long-term treatment with etretinate and who have undergone detailed evaluation for the development of visual dysfunction over a 1-year period. Despite prolonged treatment and high total doses no evidence of ocular toxicity attributable to the drug was found in any of the patients. 
MR imaging findings in patients with bone-chip allografts. Increasing use of MR to evaluate primary bone neoplasms has stimulated numerous articles on the initial assessment of these lesions. However, scant MR literature has been written about the postoperative MR appearance. We studied the MR appearance of lesions treated by curettage followed by packing with cancellous bone-chip allograft. We retrospectively reviewed the MR scans of 18 consecutive patients treated in this way. Pathologic diagnoses of these lesions were confirmed according to commonly accepted criteria. The allograft sites showed a distinctive pattern of speckled bright signal on T1-weighted images in eight cases. Thirteen of 18 grafts showed a whorled or speckled pattern of increased signal on the T2-weighted images. Only four allograft regions had predominantly low signal on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Two of 18 patients had recurrent tumor proved by open biopsy. MR images in these cases showed areas of homogeneous signal that replaced areas of speckled hyperintensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images. In both these recurrences the tumor had signal intensity similar to that seen on the preoperative MR study. We conclude that knowledge of the MR appearance of cancellous bone chip allografts is important to avoid misinterpreting areas of high signal on T1- or T2-weighted images as areas of recurrence of tumor and/or hemorrhage. 
The long-term results of artificial sphincters in children. To determine the long-term efficacy of the artificial urinary sphincter, 36 consecutive children in whom a prosthesis was implanted between August 1978 and July 1985 were followed for a minimum of 5 years and re-evaluated within the last 3 months. Of the 36 sphincters 27 (75%) are currently in place; 2 of these 27 sphincters are dysfunctional due to fluid leakage. Of the 25 functioning sphincters 14 have required no further prosthetic operation, 10 needed 1 revision and 1 patient had 5 revisions. Fluid leakage, occurring in 12 patients, was the most common complication requiring reoperation. Twenty patients are completely continent (11 of whom without any medication) and 5 are occasionally damp. The over-all success rate at 2 and 5 years was 84 and 62%, respectively. The mean survival time of the prosthesis was 7.2 years and the mean standard interval was greater than 10.5 years. Patients with higher balloon pressures (81 to 100 cm. water) had more complications, and a decreased rate of success than those with lower pressure balloons (51 to 80 cm. water, p = 0.02). There was no difference in success rates between boys and girls (p = 0.98), although girls who had a prior bladder neck operation tended to have a higher rate of cuff erosion. Sphincters placed after 1980 (model AS800) had a lower reoperation rate than those placed earlier. In selected instances, the artificial urinary sphincter appears to be a viable long-term alternative for management of children with intractable incontinence who have either failed or are unsuitable for other methods of treatment. 
Resting energy expenditure in chronic cardiac failure. 1. Resting energy expenditure has previously been shown to be elevated in the acute phase of heart failure, but the situation in the compensated state of chronic cardiac failure is unclear. Resting energy expenditure was assessed in 14 patients with stable chronic cardiac failure and 14 matched control subjects by using indirect calorimetry. 2. Resting energy expenditure was significantly elevated in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (112.6 +/- 18.1 versus 87.1 +/- 12.2 kJ day-1 kg-1 total body weight, P less than 0.0002; mean +/- SD) as were resting O2 consumption (3.88 +/- 0.64 versus 3.00 +/- 0.43 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0002), ventilation (164 +/- 40.3 versus 104 +/- 16.2 ml min-1 kg-1, P less than 0.0001) and heart rate (85.8 +/- 16.9 versus 66.6 +/- 6.9 beats/min, P less than 0.001). Both the resting plasma concentration of noradrenaline (4.48 +/- 1.52 versus 2.28 +/- 0.96 nmol/l, P less than 0.0001) and the serum concentration of free fatty acids (0.78 +/- 0.21 versus 0.57 +/- 0.27 mmol/l, P less than 0.03) were greater in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Analysis of covariance indicated that most of the difference in resting energy expenditure could be accounted for by the elevated ventilation in the patients with chronic cardiac failure. Arm muscle area, an index of wasting, was lower in the patients with chronic cardiac failure (39.1 +/- 13.1 versus 50.5 +/- 9.4 cm2, P less than 0.02) and resting energy expenditure was found to account for some of this difference. 3. We conclude that an elevated basal metabolism occurs in chronic cardiac failure. 
Cirrhosis of the liver. A regenerative process. The ancient story of Prometheus, chained to a rock for defying Zeus by stealing fire from Mount Olympus and subjected to daily tearing at his liver by an eagle, attests to the early recognition of the extraordinary regenerative capacity of the human liver. This process had remained an intriguing mystery over the millennia. In the last 20 years, following the pioneering work of Bucher (1) and Moolten et al (2), there has been an explosion of research that has clarified some of the mechanisms underlying the process of hepatic regeneration. Regeneration implies proliferation and regeneration. After the fetal and postnatal growth of the liver is completed, hepatocytes no longer proliferate actively, but they can proliferate in response to cell death or loss (3). Hepatocyte growth responses are of particular research interest because they occur in vivo and involve cells that are normally quiescent. Hepatic regeneration constitutes a highly regulated process that is best shown by the arrest of liver growth following a partial hepatectomy precisely at the moment the hepatic mass reaches the mass of the original intact liver (3). This suggests that hepatic regeneration after a partial hepatectomy is a strictly regulated nonautonomous growth process that is controlled by the same factors that are responsible for the determination and maintenance of hepatic mass in a normal individual. In response to a partial hepatectomy, hepatocytes enter the cell cycle and progress to DNA synthesis and replication but only in numbers sufficient to restore the hepatic mass. The regeneration response is both synchronized and universal in that it affects all intrahepatic cell lines, including nonparenchymal cells.
